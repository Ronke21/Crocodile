<text>Hotel Rwanda is a 2004 biographical historical drama film co-written and directed by Terry George. It was adapted from a screenplay by George and Keir Pearson, and stars Don Cheadle and Sophie Okonedo as hotelier Paul Rusesabagina and his wife Tatiana. Based on the Rwandan genocide, which occurred during the spring of 1994, the film depicts Rusesabagina&#x27;s efforts to save the lives of his family and more than 1,000 other refugees by providing them with shelter in the besieged Hôtel des Mille Collines. &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; explores genocide, political corruption, and the repercussions of violence.

The film was a co-production between United Artists and Lions Gate Films, and was commercially distributed by United Artists theatrically and by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for home media. &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; premiered in theaters in limited release in the United States on 22 December 2004 and in wide release on 4 February 2005, grossing more than $23 million in domestic ticket sales. It earned an additional $10 million in business through international release to top out at a combined total of nearly $34 million in gross revenue.

The film was nominated for multiple awards, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor (Cheadle), Best Supporting Actress (Okonedo), and Best Original Screenplay.

==Plot==
In April 1994, tensions between the Hutu-controlled government and Tutsi rebels lead to genocide in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians are routine. Paul Rusesabagina, manager of the Belgian-owned Hôtel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana is Tutsi. Their marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, including Georges Rutaganda, a goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia.
Paul curries favor with Rwandan Army general Augustin Bizimungu, who favors the Hutu. Following the assassination of the president, a Hutu, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed, initiating the early stages of the genocide. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army Captain threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety and brings them to the hotel. Upon returning with them, he finds his insolent receptionist Gregoire occupying the presidential suite and threatening to expose the Tutsi refugees, including Paul&#x27;s wife, if he is made to work.

The UN peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver, are forbidden to intervene in the conflict and prevent the genocide. Paul&#x27;s boss and owner of the hotel, who lives in Belgium, apologizes to him over the phone, saying there&#x27;s nothing he can do to provide safe passage for him and his family. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind to fend for themselves.
More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened United Nations refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages, totaling 800, both Tutsi and Hutu. Tatiana desperately searches for her brother, sister-in-law, and two nieces. As the situation becomes more violent, Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, protect his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning 4-star hotel. Paul forces Gregoire to work with the help of General Bizimungu.

Low on supplies, Paul and Gregoire drive to collect hotel supplies from Georges Rutaganda and witness the Interahamwe militia raping Tutsi hostages. Georges explains to Paul that the &quot;rich cockroaches&quot; money will become worthless since all of the Tutsis will be killed. Paul expresses disbelief that the Hutu extremists will wipe out all of the Tutsis, but Georges replies: &quot;Why not? We are halfway there already.&quot; They return to the hotel through the dark, thick fog, on the riverside road recommended by Georges, only to find it is carpeted with dead bodies.

When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul&#x27;s family, Gregoire betrays them to the Interahamwe, who use radio broadcasts to accost them. After giving General Bizimungu the remaining valuables and Scotch from his office safe to protect the refugees, Paul then admonishes Bizimungu for genocide apathy and promises to testify on his behalf for his help.
Soon afterward, Paul&#x27;s family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel through retreating masses of refugees and militia to reach safety behind Tutsi rebel lines and are reunited with their nieces.

The end title cards explain that Paul saved at least 1,200 Tutsi and Hutu refugees. He and his family, who adopted the two nieces, moved to Belgium, but Tatiana&#x27;s brother Thomas and his wife were never found. The genocide came to an end in July 1994 when the Tutsi rebels drove the Hutu and the Interahamwe militia across the border into the Congo. At least 800,000 people died in the genocide. Georges and Bizimungu were tried and sentenced for war crimes, with Georges receiving a life sentence.

== Production and historical accuracy==
In 1999, Rusesabagina received a phone call from an American screenwriter named Keir Pearson. Pearson, along with his colleague Terry George, went on to write the script for &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; in consultation with Rusesabagina. The script was made into a Hollywood film, starring Don Cheadle as Rusesabagina. The film was released in 2004 to much critical acclaim. It received three Academy Award nominations, including for Best Original Screenplay and Best Actor for Don Cheadle&#x27;s portrayal of Rusesabagina. Sharing his thoughts about the lack of international intervention during the crisis, director Terry George commented, &quot;It&#x27;s simple ... African lives are not seen as valuable as the lives of Europeans or Americans.&quot;

Rusesabagina has since come under criticism from some survivors of the Genocide. In 2008, the book &quot;Hotel Rwanda, or, the Tutsi Genocide as seen by Hollywood&quot; by Alfred Ndahiro, who was a former advisor to Paul Kagame, and journalist Privat Rutazibwa, was published. The authors conducted interviews with 74 people who had stayed in the Hotel during the Genocide. &quot;Inside the Hotel Rwanda: The Surprising True Story … And Why it Matters Today&quot;, co-written by Hotel des Mille Collines Survivor Edouard Kayihura and American author Kerry Zukus, was published in 2011.

The books include allegations that during the Genocide, Rusesabagina extorted money from hotel guests for rooms and food. It was also reported that the UN headquarters in Kigali received information that Rusesabagina had provided a Rwandan army commander with a list of hotel guests and their room numbers. UN observers managed to change the room numbers of those most threatened. The character of the Canadian Colonel is based on Senator Roméo Dallaire, now retired Lieutenant-General from the Canadian Armed Forces. Dallaire was not pleased with the film&#x27;s portrayal of the events that he witnessed, arguing he and his men did far more to help survivors. He recounted his own experiences in his biography, &quot;Shake Hands with the Devil&quot;. The book was later adapted into two feature films; a documentary, and a 2007 dramatic motion picture.

In response to critics, Odette Nyiramilimo, a prominent survivor who became a senator in the new government, pushed back against Paul Ruseabagina&#x27;s suspected bad-faith intentions, saying: &quot;I never saw him threaten to expel people from the hotel if they didn’t pay up — never.&quot;

George stated that it was important to craft the film for a mass-market audience, using the question of whether the film is &quot;going to play in Peoria? Will it be understood? Is it mainstream enough?&quot;

== Filming ==
Principal filming was shot on location in Kigali, Rwanda, and Johannesburg, South Africa. The real Hôtel des Mille Collines was not used in the film. Instead, a vacant hospital in South Africa was the primary filming location. Paul Rusesabagina was consulted during the writing of the film. Although the character of Colonel Oliver played by Nolte is fictional in nature, the role was inspired by the UN force commander for UNAMIR, Roméo Dallaire. Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni, then-Rwandan president Juvénal Habyarimana, and Rwandan Patriotic Front leader (now president) Paul Kagame appear in archive television footage in the film.

The producers of the film partnered with the United Nations Foundation to create the International Fund for Rwanda, which supported United Nations Development Programme initiatives assisting Rwandan survivors. &quot;The goal of the film is not only to engage audiences in this story of genocide but also to inspire them to help redress the terrible devastation,&quot; said George.

=== Soundtrack ===
The original motion picture soundtrack for &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; was released by the Commotion label on 11 January 2005. It features songs written by Wyclef Jean, Deborah Cox, and others. The music for the film was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, Andrea Guerra, and the Afro Celt Sound System, while being edited by Michael Connell.

==Marketing==
===Novel===
Hotelier Paul Rusesabagina&#x27;s experience encouraged director George to produce the film. A paperback novel published by Newmarket Press, titled &quot;Hotel Rwanda: Bringing the True Story of an African Hero to Film&quot;, released on 7 February 2005, dramatizes the events of the Rwandan Genocide in 1994, as depicted in the film, and expands on the ideas of how Rusesabagina sheltered and saved more than 1,200 people in the hotel he managed in Kigali by summarizing three years of research, articles that chronicle the historical events, and the ensuing aftermath. A brief history and timeline, the making of the film, and the complete screenplay written by Keir Pearson and Terry George are covered in thorough detail.

===Critical response===
Among mainstream critics in the U.S., the film received largely positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes 91% of 191 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 8/10 and the consensus calling it a &quot;sobering and heartfelt tale about the massacre that took place in Rwanda while most of the world looked away.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 40 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Michael Rechtshaffen, writing in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, stated actor &quot;Cheadle impressively carries the entire picture, delivering the kind of note-perfect performance that&#x27;s absolutely deserving of Oscar consideration.&quot; Roger Ebert in the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it a &quot;riveting drama&quot;, while exclaiming &quot;The film works not because the screen is filled with meaningless special effects, formless action and vast digital armies, but because Cheadle, Nolte and the filmmakers are interested in how two men choose to function in an impossible situation. Because we sympathize with these men, we are moved by the film.&quot; In the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, Mick LaSalle wrote that the film was a &quot;harrowing experience&quot;, and that &quot;it documents for a mass audience what it was like. It&#x27;s useful, in that it shows how it can happen. It&#x27;s even hopeful, in that it shows that it&#x27;s possible—not guaranteed, but possible—for people to maintain their humanity in the face of unhinged barbarism.&quot; Claudia Puig of &quot;USA Today&quot; stated the film was &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most moving and powerful films, anchored by a magnificent performance by Don Cheadle.&quot; She declared, &quot;&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; emerges as an African version of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;.&quot; The film was not without detractors, Dave Sterrit of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; felt that, although the subject matter was crucially important, &quot;the movie dilutes its impact with by-the-numbers filmmaking, and Cheadle&#x27;s one-note performance displays few of his acting gifts.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented on the character significance of the U.N. personnel, she stated it was &quot;a bad day for narrative, if not for diplomacy, when there is only one 3-D character among the entire U.N. lot, clad in their blue helmets, and that role is rasped by Nick Nolte with moral remorse rather than his more usual hint of dissolution.&quot; In her overall summation, she wrote &quot;&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; is a strange history lesson that leaves us more overlectured than properly overwhelmed.&quot; Michael Atkinson of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, added to the negativity by stating the film was &quot;told to us secondhand, or glimpsed in distant scuffles&quot; and &quot;Like the majority of movies about the last century of holocausts, &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; is as earnest and tasteful as its creators. To capture the white-hot terror of social calamity, someone a little more lawless and fierce might be called for.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote the film was &quot;a political thriller based on fact that hammers every button on the emotional console.&quot; He commended how the film &quot;offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked&quot; while also praising &quot;Mr. Cheadle&#x27;s magnificent, understated portrayal&quot;. James Berardinelli, writing for &quot;ReelViews&quot;, called the film &quot;powerful&quot; and noted that it didn&#x27;t &quot;pull as many punches as its detractors would have us believe.&quot; Berardinelli also wrote the film was &quot;brutal and shocking when it needs to be, but it also has great emotional scope and power. We find ourselves enmeshed in Paul&#x27;s struggle, sharing his despair at the warfare tearing apart his country, his frustration and anger at the U.N.&#x27;s inability to act, and, eventually, his hope for a better tomorrow.&quot; Describing some pitfalls, Jeff Vice of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; stated the &quot;decision by the filmmakers to show things from that limited viewpoint—to show how isolated and fearful the characters were of the chaos going on around them—the film feels a little dishonest and diminished. It&#x27;s never quite as effective as &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; or &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; in that the film&#x27;s overall impact is not as great and it doesn&#x27;t linger in the memory.&quot; Vice was quick to admit &quot;&quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; does have its share of powerful moments; in particular, a scene in which Paul and another hotel employee unknowingly—due to fog—drive into a mass grave.&quot; He also expressed satisfaction with the acting, stating &quot;Cheadle brings a needed intensity to the film; his character&#x27;s fear and compassion are quite vivid. Nolte is also good in his limited screen time, as is Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a news cameraman.&quot;

Eleanor R. Gillespie of &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; stated that &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; was an &quot;unforgettable film&quot; as well as &quot;a doubly unforgettable performance by Don Cheadle.&quot; Although mentioning &quot;The parallels with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; are obvious&quot;, she praised individual cinematic elements that made the film unique, such as &quot;the revelation of a dark, bumpy road paved with thousands of corpses. Or in a little girl&#x27;s heartwrenching plea, &#x27;Please don&#x27;t let them kill me. I promise I won&#x27;t be Tutsi anymore&#x27;.&quot; She concluded her review with Cheadle&#x27;s noteworthy performance, stating he gave &quot;one of the best performances (if not the best) of last year—an Oscar-worthy portrait of a man who kept his head clear and his humanity intact in the midst of a man-made hell.&quot; Similarly, David Ansen wrote in &quot;Newsweek&quot; that &quot;two performances carry the film. Cheadle, in his richest role since &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;, burrows deep inside this complex man, who discovers in himself a strength he never knew he possessed, as he faces the disillusionment of all the &quot;civilized&quot; notions he believes in. As his strong, committed wife, Tatiana, Sophie Okonedo, barely resembling the saucy hooker she played in &quot;Dirty Pretty Things&quot;, is a revelation.&quot; However, in the &quot;Arizona Daily Star&quot;, Phil Villarreal was not moved by the lead acting of Cheadle or Nolte. He thought the characters were &quot;cardboardish&quot; and stated the &quot;uplifting moments of rescue seem antiseptic and set up.&quot; Critic Leonard Maltin wrote that &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot; was a &quot;powerful film&quot; that he thought avoided being &quot;overly didactic by focusing on one compelling character, believably brought to life by Cheadle.&quot; In &quot;Reel Power: Hollywood Cinema and American Supremacy&quot;, drawing on the work of journalist Keith Harmon Snow and writer Edward S. Herman, author Matthew Alford called the film &quot;sensitive, humane and powerful&quot; but noted that it was &quot;striking how the history of bloodshed has been spun in line with Western interests&quot;.

<text>Kings Mills is a census-designated place in the northeastern corner of Deerfield Township of Warren County, Ohio, United States, on the western shore of the Little Miami River. The population was 1,336 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Another town, Gainsboro, was platted on the site of present-day Kings Mills in 1815, but it did not prosper. Kings Mills was established in 1884 as a company town for the King Powder Company, and the Peters Cartridge Company which ceased operations in 1944.

Kings Mills was formerly the home of the College Football Hall of Fame, which moved to South Bend, Indiana in 1995.

==Geography==
Kings Mills is located along I-71 twenty miles northeast of Cincinnati, less than a mile east of Mason, two miles southwest of South Lebanon, two and one-half miles north of Fosters, and two miles west of Hopkinsville. 

The community is in the Mason (513) telephone exchange and is served by the Kings Mills/Kings Island post office (45034).

The Little Miami Scenic Trail, which runs from Milford to Spring Valley, passes by the community on the eastern shore of the Little Miami River in the former Little Miami Railroad right-of-way.

Kings Island amusement park and Great Wolf Lodge indoor water park are immediately south of the community in Mason.

==Education== 
Kings Mills is located in the Kings Local School District.

==Notable People==
* Leelah Alcorn, transgender girl whose suicide attracted international attention
* Bryan Volpenhein, rower and Olympian

<doc id="1102297" wikidata="Q1017274" url="?curid=1102297" title="Difference of two squares">
<text>In mathematics, the difference of two squares is a squared (multiplied by itself) number subtracted from another squared number. Every difference of squares may be factored according to the identity

:formula_1

in elementary algebra.

==Proof==
=== Algebraic proof ===
The proof of the factorization identity is straightforward. Starting from the right-hand side, apply the distributive law to get 
:formula_2
By the commutative law, the middle two terms cancel:
:formula_3
leaving
:formula_4
The resulting identity is one of the most commonly used in mathematics. Among many uses, it gives a simple proof of the AM–GM inequality in two variables.

The proof holds in any commutative ring.

Conversely, if this identity holds in a ring &quot;R&quot; for all pairs of elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, then &quot;R&quot; is commutative. To see this, apply the distributive law to the right-hand side of the equation and get
:formula_5.
For this to be equal to formula_6, we must have
:formula_3
for all pairs &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, so &quot;R&quot; is commutative.

=== Geometric proof ===
The difference of two squares can also be illustrated geometrically as the difference of two square areas in a plane. In the diagram, the shaded part represents the difference between the areas of the two squares, i.e. formula_6. The area of the shaded part can be found by adding the areas of the two rectangles; formula_9, which can be factorized to formula_10. Therefore, formula_11.

Another geometric proof proceeds as follows: We start with the figure shown in the first diagram below, a large square with a smaller square removed from it. The side of the entire square is a, and the side of the small removed square is b. The area of the shaded region is formula_12. A cut is made, splitting the region into two rectangular pieces, as shown in the second diagram. The larger piece, at the top, has width a and height a-b. The smaller piece, at the bottom, has width a-b and height b. Now the smaller piece can be detached, rotated, and placed to the right of the larger piece. In this new arrangement, shown in the last diagram below, the two pieces together form a rectangle, whose width is formula_13 and whose height is formula_14. This rectangle&#x27;s area is formula_10. Since this rectangle came from rearranging the original figure, it must have the same area as the original figure. Therefore, formula_1.
==Usage==
===Factorization of polynomials and simplification of expressions===
The formula for the difference of two squares can be used for factoring polynomials that contain the square of a first quantity minus the square of a second quantity. For example, the polynomial formula_17 can be factored as follows:

:formula_18

As a second example, the first two terms of formula_19 can be factored as formula_20, so we have:

:formula_21

Moreover, this formula can also be used for simplifying expressions:

:formula_22

===Complex number case: sum of two squares===
The difference of two squares is used to find the linear factors of the &quot;sum&quot; of two squares, using complex number coefficients.

For example, the complex roots of formula_23 can be found using difference of two squares:

:formula_23
:formula_25 (since formula_26)
:formula_27
:formula_28

Therefore, the linear factors are formula_29 and formula_30.

Since the two factors found by this method are complex conjugates, we can use this in reverse as a method of multiplying a complex number to get a real number. This is used to get real denominators in complex fractions.

===Rationalising denominators===
The difference of two squares can also be used in the rationalising of irrational denominators. This is a method for removing surds from expressions (or at least moving them), applying to division by some combinations involving square roots.

For example:
The denominator of formula_31 can be rationalised as follows:

:formula_31

:formula_33

:formula_34

:formula_35

:formula_36

:formula_37

Here, the irrational denominator formula_38 has been rationalised to formula_39.

===Mental arithmetic===

The difference of two squares can also be used as an arithmetical short cut. If two numbers (whose average is a number which is easily squared) are multiplied, the difference of two squares can be used to give you the product of the original two numbers.

For example: 
:formula_40

Using the difference of two squares, formula_41 can be restated as
:formula_6 which is formula_43.

===Difference of two consecutive perfect squares===

The difference of two consecutive perfect squares is the sum of the two bases &quot;n&quot; and &quot;n&quot;+1. This can be seen as follows:

:formula_44

Therefore, the difference of two consecutive perfect squares is an odd number. Similarly, the difference of two arbitrary perfect squares is calculated as follows:

:formula_45

Therefore, the difference of two even perfect squares is a multiple of 4 and the difference of two odd perfect squares is a multiple of 8.

===Galileo&#x27;s law of odd numbers===
A ramification of the difference of consecutive squares, Galileo&#x27;s law of odd numbers states that the distance covered by an object falling without resistance in uniform gravity in successive equal time intervals is linearly proportional to the odd numbers. That is, if a body falling from rest covers a certain distance during an arbitrary time interval, it will cover 3, 5, 7, etc. times that distance in the subsequent time intervals of the same length.

From the equation for uniform linear acceleration, the distance covered 
formula_46
for initial speed formula_47 constant acceleration formula_48 (acceleration due to gravity without air resistance), and time elapsed formula_49 it follows that the distance formula_50 is proportional to formula_51 (in symbols, formula_52), thus the distance from the starting point are consecutive squares for integer values of time elapsed.

===Factorization of integers===

Several algorithms in number theory and cryptography use differences of squares to find factors of integers and detect composite numbers. A simple example is the Fermat factorization method, which considers the sequence of numbers formula_53, for formula_54. If one of the formula_55 equals a perfect square formula_56, then formula_57 is a (potentially non-trivial) factorization of formula_58.

This trick can be generalized as follows. If formula_59 mod formula_58 and formula_61 mod formula_58, then formula_58 is composite with non-trivial factors formula_64 and formula_65. This forms the basis of several factorization algorithms (such as the quadratic sieve) and can be combined with the Fermat primality test to give the stronger Miller–Rabin primality test.

==Generalizations==

The identity also holds in inner product spaces over the field of real numbers, such as for dot product of Euclidean vectors:
:formula_66
The proof is identical. For the special case that and have equal norms (which means that their dot squares are equal), this demonstrates analytically the fact that two diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. This follows from the left side of the equation being equal to zero, requiring the right side to equal zero as well, and so the vector sum of (the long diagonal of the rhombus) dotted with the vector difference (the short diagonal of the rhombus) must equal zero, which indicates the diagonals are perpendicular.

===Difference of two &quot;n&quot;th powers===

If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are two elements of a commutative ring, then

formula_67

Note that the second factor looks similar to the binomial expansion of formula_68, except that it does not include the binomial coefficients formula_69.

==History==
Historically, the Babylonians used the difference of two squares to calculate multiplications.

For example:

93 × 87 = 902 − 32 = 8091

64 × 56 = 602 − 42 = 3584

<text>Zopiclone, sold under the brand name Imovane among others, is a nonbenzodiazepine, specifically a cyclopyrrolone, used to treat difficulty sleeping. Zopiclone is molecularly distinct from benzodiazepine drugs and is classed as a cyclopyrrolone. However, zopiclone increases the normal transmission of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the central nervous system, via modulating GABAA receptors similarly to the way benzodiazepine drugs do inducing sedation but not with the anti-anxiety properties of the benzodiazepines.

Zopiclone is a sedative. It works by causing a depression or tranquilization of the central nervous system. After prolonged use, the body can become accustomed to the effects of zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is abruptly stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Although withdrawal symptoms from therapeutic doses of zopiclone and its isomers (i.e., eszopiclone) do not typically present with convulsions and are therefore not considered life-threatening, patients may experience such significant agitation or anxiety that they seek emergency medical attention. 

In the United States, zopiclone is not commercially available, although its active stereoisomer, eszopiclone, is. Zopiclone is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. 

Zopiclone is known colloquially as a &quot;Z-drug&quot;. Other Z-drugs include zaleplon and zolpidem and were initially thought to be less addictive than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. Zopiclone is recommended to be taken at the lowest effective dose, with a duration of 2–3 weeks for short-term insomnia. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised, and caution must be taken when the compound is used in conjunction with benzodiazepines, sedatives or other drugs affecting the central nervous system.

==Medical uses==

Zopiclone is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia where sleep initiation or sleep maintenance are prominent symptoms. Long-term use is not recommended, as tolerance, dependence, and addiction can occur. One low-quality study found that zopiclone is ineffective in improving sleep quality or increasing sleep time in shift workers, and more research in this area has been recommended.

Cognitive behavioral therapy has been found to be superior to zopiclone in the treatment of insomnia and has been found to have lasting effects on sleep quality for at least a year after therapy.

===Specific populations===
====Elderly====
Zopiclone, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. The combination with alcohol consumption increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. 
Zopiclone increases postural sway and increases the number of falls in older people, as well as cognitive side effects. Falls are a significant cause of death in older people.

An extensive review of the medical literature regarding the management of insomnia and the elderly found that considerable evidence of the effectiveness and lasting benefits of nondrug treatments for insomnia exist. Compared with the benzodiazepines, the nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics, such as zopiclone, offer few if any advantages in efficacy or tolerability in elderly persons. Newer agents such as the melatonin receptor agonists may be more suitable and effective for the management of chronic insomnia in elderly people. Long-term use of sedative-hypnotics for insomnia lacks an evidence base and is discouraged for reasons that include concerns about such potential adverse drug effects as cognitive impairment (anterograde amnesia), daytime sedation, motor incoordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls. In addition, the effectiveness and safety of long-term use of nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs remains to be determined.

====Liver disease====
Patients with liver disease eliminate zopiclone much more slowly than normal patients and in addition experience exaggerated pharmacological effects of the drug.

==Adverse reactions==
Sleeping pills, including zopiclone, have been associated with an increased risk of death. The British National Formulary states adverse reactions as follows: &quot;taste disturbance (some report a metallic taste); less commonly nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache; rarely amnesia, confusion, depression, hallucinations, nightmares; very rarely light headedness, incoordination, paradoxical effects [...] and sleep-walking also reported&quot;.

==Contraindications==
Zopiclone causes impaired driving skills similar to those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving, with users of hypnotic drugs even after one year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who drive motor vehicles should not take zopiclone as there is a significantly increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand-eye coordination.

A double-blind study on the effect on performance of several hypnotic medications, relevant to military personnel who may have to be awakened to carry out duties, found that drugs listed in increasing order of performance impact duration were melatonin (with no impact), zaleplon, temazepam, and zopiclone. The effects on serial reaction time (SRT), logical reasoning (LRT), serial subtraction (SST), and multitask (MT) were measured. For zaleplon (10 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg) and temazepam (15 mg) respectively the times to recover normal performance for SRT were 3.25, , and 5.25 hours; for LRT 3.25, , and 4.25 hours; for SST 2.25, , and 4.25 hours; and for MT 2.25, , and 3.25 hours. The study did not consider the effectiveness of the drugs on sleep.

==EEG and sleep==
It causes similar alterations on EEG readings and sleep architecture as benzodiazepines and causes disturbances in sleep architecture on withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. Zopiclone reduces both delta waves and the number of high-amplitude delta waves whilst increasing low-amplitude waves. Zopiclone reduces the total amount of time spent in REM sleep as well as delaying its onset. In EEG studies, zopiclone significantly increases the energy of the beta frequency band, increasing stage 2. Zopiclone is less selective to the α1 site and has higher affinity to the α2 site than zaleplon. Zopiclone is therefore very similar pharmacologically to benzodiazepines.

==Overdose==
Zopiclone is sometimes used as a method of suicide. It has a similar fatality index to that of benzodiazepine drugs, apart from temazepam, which is particularly toxic in overdose. Deaths have occurred from zopiclone overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs. Overdose of zopiclone may present with excessive sedation and depressed respiratory function that may progress to coma and possibly death. Zopiclone combined with alcohol, opiates, or other central nervous system depressants may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zopiclone overdosage can be treated with the GABAA receptor benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zopiclone from its binding site, thereby rapidly reversing its effects. Serious effects on the heart may also occur from a zopiclone overdose when combined with piperazine.

Death certificates show the number of zopiclone-related deaths is on the rise. When taken alone, it usually is not fatal, but when mixed with alcohol or other drugs such as opioids, or in patients with respiratory, or hepatic disorders, the risk of a serious and fatal overdose increases.

==Interactions==
Zopiclone also interacts with trimipramine and caffeine.

Alcohol has an additive effect when combined with zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly. Due to these risks and the increased risk for dependence, alcohol should be avoided when using zopiclone.

Erythromycin appears to increase the absorption rate of zopiclone and prolong its elimination half-life, leading to increased plasma levels and more pronounced effects. Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole drug interaction with zopiclone. Temporary dosage reduction during combined therapy may be required, especially in the elderly.
Rifampicin causes a very notable reduction in half-life of zopiclone and peak plasma levels, which results in a large reduction in the hypnotic effect of zopiclone. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may also provoke similar interactions. Ketoconazole and sulfaphenazole interfere with the metabolism of zopiclone. Nefazodone impairs the metabolism of zopiclone leading to increased zopiclone levels and marked next-day sedation.

==Pharmacology==
The therapeutic pharmacological properties of zopiclone include hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and myorelaxant properties. Zopiclone and benzodiazepines bind to the same sites on GABAA receptors, causing an enhancement of the actions of GABA to produce the therapeutic and adverse effects of zopiclone. The metabolite of zopiclone desmethylzopiclone is also pharmacologically active, although it has predominately anxiolytic properties. One study found some slight selectivity for zopiclone on α1 and α5 subunits, although it is regarded as being unselective in its binding to GABAA receptors containing α1, α2, α3, and α5 subunits. Desmethylzopiclone has been found to have partial agonist properties, unlike the parent drug zopiclone, which is a full agonist. The mechanism of action of zopiclone is similar to benzodiazepines, with similar effects on locomotor activity and on dopamine and serotonin turnover.
A meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials that compared benzodiazepines to zopiclone or other Z drugs such as zolpidem and zaleplon has found few clear and consistent differences between zopiclone and the benzodiazepines in sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.
Zopiclone is in the cyclopyrrolone family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include suriclone. Zopiclone, although molecularly different from benzodiazepines, shares an almost identical pharmacological profile as benzodiazepines, including anxiolytic properties. Its mechanism of action is by binding to the benzodiazepine site and acting as a full agonist, which in turn positively modulates benzodiazepine-sensitive GABAA receptors and enhances GABA binding at the GABAA receptors to produce zopiclone&#x27;s pharmacological properties. In addition to zopiclone&#x27;s benzodiazepine pharmacological properties, it also has some barbiturate-like properties.

===Pharmacokinetics===

After oral administration, zopiclone is rapidly absorbed, with a bioavailability around 75–80%. Time to peak plasma concentration is 1–2 hours. A high-fat meal preceding zopiclone administration does not change absorption (as measured by AUC), but reduces peak plasma levels and delays its occurrence, thus may delay the onset of therapeutic effects.

The plasma protein-binding of zopiclone has been reported to be weak, between 45 and 80% (mean 52–59%). It is rapidly and widely distributed to body tissues, including the brain, and is excreted in urine, saliva, and breast milk. Zopiclone is partly extensively metabolized in the liver to form an active &quot;N&quot;-demethylated derivative (&quot;N&quot;-desmethylzopiclone) and an inactive zopiclone-&quot;N&quot;-oxide. Hepatic enzymes playing the most significant role in zopiclone metabolism are CYP3A4 and CYP2E1. In addition, about 50% of the administered dose is decarboxylated and excreted via the lungs. In urine, the &quot;N&quot;-demethyl and &quot;N&quot;-oxide metabolites account for 30% of the initial dose. Between 7 and 10% of zopiclone is recovered from the urine, indicating extensive metabolism of the drug before excretion. The terminal elimination half-life of zopiclone ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 hours (5 hours on average).

The pharmacokinetics of zopiclone in humans are stereoselective. After oral administration of the racemic mixture, Cmax (time to maximum plasma concentration), area under the plasma time-concentration curve (AUC) and terminal elimination half-life values are higher for the dextrorotatory enantiomers, owing to the slower total clearance and smaller volume of distribution (corrected by the bioavailability), compared with the levorotatory enantiomer. In urine, the concentrations of the dextrorotatory enantiomers of the &quot;N&quot;-demethyl and &quot;N&quot;-oxide metabolites are higher than those of the respective antipodes.

The pharmacokinetics of zopiclone are altered by aging and are influenced by renal and hepatic functions. In severe chronic kidney failure, the area under the curve value for zopiclone was larger and the half-life associated with the elimination rate constant longer, but these changes were not considered to be clinically significant. Sex and race have not been found to interact with pharmacokinetics of zopiclone.

==Chemistry==
The melting point of zopiclone is 178 °C. Zopiclone&#x27;s solubility in water, at room temperature (25 °C) are 0.151 mg/mL. The logP value of zopiclone is 0.8.

===Detection in biological fluids===
Zopiclone may be measured in blood, plasma, or urine by chromatographic methods. Plasma concentrations are typically less than 100 μg/L during therapeutic use, but frequently exceed 100 μg/L in automotive vehicle operators arrested for impaired driving ability and may exceed 1000 μg/L in acutely poisoned patients. &quot;Post mortem&quot; blood concentrations are usually in a range of 400 to 3900 μg/L in victims of fatal acute overdose.

==History==
Zopiclone was developed and first introduced in 1986 by Rhône-Poulenc S.A., now part of Sanofi, the main worldwide manufacturer. Initially, it was promoted as an improvement on benzodiazepines, but a recent meta-analysis found it was no better than benzodiazepines in any of the aspects assessed. On April 4, 2005, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration listed zopiclone under schedule IV, due to evidence that the drug has addictive properties similar to benzodiazepines.

Zopiclone, as traditionally sold worldwide, is a racemic mixture of two stereoisomers, only one of which is active. In 2005, the pharmaceutical company Sepracor of Marlborough, Massachusetts, began marketing the active stereoisomer eszopiclone under the name Lunesta in the United States. This had the consequence of placing what is a generic drug in most of the world under patent control in the United States. Generic forms of Lunesta have since become available in the United States. Zopiclone is currently available off-patent in a number of European countries, Brazil, Canada, Hong Kong, and New Zealand. The eszopiclone/zopiclone difference is in the dosage—the strongest eszopiclone dosage contains 3 mg of the therapeutic stereoisomer, whereas the highest zopiclone dosage (10 mg) contains 5 mg of the active stereoisomer. The two agents have not yet been studied in head-to-head clinical trials to determine the existence of any potential clinical differences (efficacy, side effects, developing dependence on the drug, safety, etc.).

==Society and culture==
===Recreational use===
Zopiclone has the potential for non-medical use, dosage escalation, and drug dependence. It is taken orally and sometimes intravenously when used non-medically, and often combined with alcohol to achieve euphoria. Patients abusing the drug are also at risk of dependence. Withdrawal symptoms can be seen after long-term use of normal doses even after a gradual reduction regimen. The Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties recommends zopiclone prescriptions not exceed 7 to 10 days, owing to concerns of addiction, tolerance, and physical dependence. Two types of drug misuse can occur: either recreational misuse, wherein the drug is taken to achieve a high, or when the drug is continued long-term against medical advice. Zopiclone may be more addictive than benzodiazepines. Those with a history of substance misuse or mental health disorders may be at an increased risk of high-dose zopiclone misuse. High dose misuse of zopiclone and increasing popularity amongst people who use substances who have been prescribed with zopiclone The symptoms of zopiclone addiction can include depression, dysphoria, hopelessness, slow thoughts, social isolation, worrying, sexual anhedonia, and nervousness.

Zopiclone and other sedative hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Other sedating drugs, including benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range and often in combination with alcohol, illegal, or addictive prescription drugs, suggesting a high degree of potential for non-medical use of benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone, as with other hypnotic drugs, is sometimes used to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults.

Zopiclone has crosstolerance with barbiturates and is able to suppress barbiturate withdrawal symptoms. It is frequently self-administered intravenously in studies on monkeys, suggesting a high risk of addictive potential.

Zopiclone is in the top ten medications obtained using a false prescription in France.

<doc id="1102330" wikidata="Q1983730" url="?curid=1102330" title="1979 World Series">
<text>The 1979 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1979 season. The 76th edition of the World Series was a best-of-seven playoff between the National League (NL) champion Pittsburgh Pirates (98–64) and the American League (AL) champion Baltimore Orioles (102–57). The Pirates won in seven games, becoming the fourth team in World Series history to come back from three games to one deficit to win the Series. This marked the second time in the 1970s the Pirates won a World Series Game 7 on the road against the Orioles, the previous time being in the 1971 World Series. The Pirates were famous for adopting Sister Sledge&#x27;s hit song &quot;We Are Family&quot; as their theme song during the 1979 season.

Left fielder/first baseman Willie Stargell, pitcher Bruce Kison, and catcher Manny Sanguillén were the only players left over from the Pirates team that defeated the Orioles in 1971, and Orioles&#x27; pitcher Jim Palmer, shortstop Mark Belanger, and manager Earl Weaver were the only remaining Orioles from the 1971 team. Grant Jackson pitched for the Orioles in the 1971 series and for the Pirates in the 1979 series.

In this series, each game was played with National League rules, meaning there was no designated hitter and the Orioles&#x27; pitchers would have to bat. While this resulted in Tim Stoddard getting his first major league hit and runs batted in (R.B.I.) in Game 4, overall, it hurt the Orioles because Lee May, their designated hitter for much of the season and a key part of their offense, was only able to bat three times in the whole series.

Willie Stargell was named the World Series Most Valuable Player after batting .400 with a record seven extra-base hits that matched Reggie Jackson&#x27;s record of 25 total bases that the latter set in 1977. At age 39, Stargell became the oldest player to be named World Series MVP, breaking the previous mark set by former Pirate, Roberto Clemente, who won the 1971 World Series MVP at the age of 37.

The 1979 Pirates were the last team to win Game 7 of a World Series on the road until the San Francisco Giants defeated the Royals in Kansas City to win Game 7 of the series. Pittsburgh also became the third city to win both the Super Bowl and the World Series in the same season or calendar year, with the Steelers having already won Super Bowl XIII (they would later repeat in Super Bowl XIV following the Pirates&#x27; championship), New York&#x27;s Jets and Mets won championships in the 1969 calendar year, followed by Baltimore (Orioles and Colts) in the 1970 season, New York (Mets and Giants) in the 1986 season, and Boston/New England in the 2004 (Red Sox and Patriots) and 2018 seasons (Red Sox and Patriots).

To date, this is Pittsburgh’s last appearance in the World Series, and they have the longest active World Series appearance drought in the National League.

==Background==
===Baltimore Orioles===
These same two teams also met in . Earl Weaver&#x27;s Orioles had won the first two games of that series only to lose to Danny Murtaugh&#x27;s Pirates in seven. This time Pittsburgh manager Chuck Tanner was looking to win a Series of his own. Gone were the likes of slugger Boog Powell and defensive wizard Brooks Robinson—shortstop Mark Belanger and pitcher Jim Palmer were the only two remaining players from the 1971 roster. A young (23-year-old) &quot;Steady Eddie&quot; Murray was a staple at first base and an emerging superstar. The only other real &quot;star&quot; hitter on the team was right fielder Ken Singleton who set career highs in home runs, 35, and runs batted in, 111, in the regular season. Center fielder Al Bumbry provided the speed, 37 swipes, and outfielder Gary Roenicke and third-baseman Doug DeCinces provided some additional power. The talented pitching staff was captained by veteran catcher Rick Dempsey. The starters were led by 1979 Cy Young Award winner Mike Flanagan (23–9, 3.08), Dennis Martinez {15-16 (18 complete games), 3.66}, Scott McGregor (13–6, 3.35), Steve Stone (11–7, 3.77) and Jim Palmer (10–6, 3.30). The bullpen helped with 30 wins against only 13 losses led by Don Stanhouse (7–3, 21 saves) and Tippy Martinez (10–3, 2.88). The Orioles won the American League East rather easily, finishing eight games ahead of the second place Milwaukee Brewers. Many considered the series a bit of a whitewash.

===Pittsburgh Pirates===
On the other hand, the Pittsburgh Pirates struggled early in the season, eventually winning the National League East by just two games over the Montreal Expos. Only after getting infielders, Tim Foli (from the New York Mets) and Bill Madlock (from the San Francisco Giants), did the Pirates start winning consistently. The great Roberto Clemente had inspired the 1971 team toward the title, and the key ingredient to the 1979 team was his successor and spiritual leader, 38-year-old Willie &quot;Pops&quot; Stargell. His clubhouse demeanor, a simple good-heartedness and friendly manner, helped keep the Pirates loose during a tight divisional race with a surprise sweep of the always powerful Cincinnati Reds in the League Championship Series.

The Bucs lineup featured the National League leader in stolen bases, Omar Moreno with 77; team runs batted in leader, Dave Parker with 94, and two-time batting champion, Bill Madlock (1975, 1976). Madlock would add two more batting titles in 1981 and 1983. The pitching staff was a ragtag bunch led by the &quot;Candy-Man&quot; John Candelaria&#x27;s 14 wins (nine losses), with five other pitchers winning ten or more games. The tall and lean Kent Tekulve had 31 saves, good for second in the league, while winning ten games.

&quot;Pops&quot; Stargell would hit three home runs in this series becoming the oldest player to win both the regular season MVP and the World Series MVP. His &quot;Family&quot; would persevere after losing three out of the first four games, giving Earl Weaver and his Orioles a déjà vu nightmare when the Bucs came back to win in seven games.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===
Game 1 was originally scheduled for Tuesday, October 9 but was postponed due to a wintry mix of rain and snow. When it was played the following night, the first-pitch temperature of 41 °F (5 °C) was the coldest in the history of the Fall Classic until it was eclipsed 18 years later in Game 4 of the 1997 World Series. A steady rain that fell throughout the contest also factored into the six total errors, three committed by each team. All five Orioles runs were scored in the first inning; two on a throwing error by second baseman Phil Garner, followed by one on a wild pitch by starter Bruce Kison and the final two on a Doug DeCinces home run. A pair of RBIs each for Garner (two-out single in the sixth) and Willie Stargell (groundout in the fourth, leadoff homer in the eighth) sparked a Pirates comeback that fell a run short.

===Game 2===
This time, the Pirates struck first with two in the second on an RBI single by Bill Madlock and a sacrifice fly by catcher Ed Ott. The Orioles countered in the bottom half of the inning with an Eddie Murray homer. Murray would also tie the game in the sixth by doubling in Ken Singleton. Murray tried to put the Orioles ahead in the same inning by tagging and attempting to score on a line-out to right by John Lowenstein, but Dave Parker threw him out easily. Making the decision to send Murray was made that much odder by the fact that Parker&#x27;s throw to the plate arrived well ahead of him. Murray tried to bowl Ott over at the plate, but the stocky Ott held fast, staying on his feet.

Murray also made a questionable base running decision in the eighth. With Murray on second and Doug DeCinces on first with no outs, Lowenstein grounded to shortstop Tim Foli. Murray strangely stopped instead of running out the force play. Foli attempted a tag which Murray eluded, and then threw to Phil Garner at second to force DeCinces. Murray&#x27;s hesitation allowed Garner to throw to third and catch him in a rundown. Murray slowed up returning to second when he should have sped back since he was entitled to the base with DeCinces being forced out.

Murray would not collect another hit or RBI for the rest of the Series.

In the ninth, after a two-out single by Ott and a walk to Garner, Manny Sanguillén pinch-hit for Don Robinson and hacked a high and outside fastball from Don Stanhouse into right for a single. Ott barely slid past the outstretched arms of catcher Rick Dempsey to score the winning run, after Murray had questionably cut-off a strong throw from RF Ken Singleton. Kent Tekulve retired the side in the ninth for the save.

===Game 3===
The Pirates jumped out to an early 3–0 lead on a Dave Parker sacrifice fly in the first and a one-out, two-run double by Garner in the second. A Benny Ayala one-out, two-run homer cut the Orioles&#x27; deficit to one just before a 67-minute rain delay in the middle of the third inning. The Orioles seized the momentum after play resumed by scoring five runs in the fourth, highlighted by a Kiko Garcia bases-loaded triple that chased Pirates starter John Candelaria from the game along with an RBI single by Ken Singleton and groundout by Doug DeCinces off of Enrique Romo. Garcia added a two-out RBI single in the seventh, finishing the evening going 4-for-4 with four RBI. Scott McGregor allowed only one other run after the second (on Bill Madlock&#x27;s RBI single in the sixth after a Willie Stargell double) and pitched a complete game to give the Orioles a 2–1 series lead.

===Game 4===
The Pirates seized an early 4–0 lead in the second on a leadoff homer by Stargell, a two-run double by Ott and an Omar Moreno two-out RBI single. The first two were among five straight hits that effectively ended starter Dennis Martínez&#x27;s afternoon. The Orioles countered with three runs in the third off Jim Bibby on consecutive one-out doubles by Garcia (2 RBI) and Ken Singleton. The Pirates stretched their lead to 6–3 on RBI doubles by John Milner and Parker in the fifth and sixth innings respectively.

With one out in the eighth and the bases loaded, Pirates manager Chuck Tanner sent in submarining relief ace Kent Tekulve to face right-handed hitting Gary Roenicke. Weaver countered by pinch-hitting lefty John Lowenstein. Lowenstein made the move pay off by slamming a two-run double. After a walk loaded the bases again, Weaver sent another lefty hitter, Terry Crowley, to bat for Dave Skaggs. Crowley smashed another two-run double off Tekulve to give the Orioles the lead. Pitcher Tim Stoddard, batting because Weaver was out of pinch hitters at that point, followed with an RBI single. An RBI force-out by Bumbry ended the scoring.

===Game 5===
With a world championship on the line and Game 1 starter Bruce Kison injured, Chuck Tanner decided to go with little-used veteran left-hander Jim Rooker as his starter. He would let Rooker go as long as possible, then bring in Bert Blyleven to finish, saving his two best pitchers, sore-shouldered John Candelaria and Jim Bibby for Games 6 and 7, if played. The risky move more than paid off as Rooker gave Tanner five good innings, retiring the first 10 batters, no-hitting for four innings, and holding the Orioles to one run in the fifth when Gary Roenicke scored on a double play grounder. The Pirate bats finally came alive against Mike Flanagan in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Willie Stargell and an RBI single by Bill Madlock. The Pirates added two more in the seventh on a RBI triple by Tim Foli and a RBI double by Dave Parker, and then three more in the eighth on a RBI single by Phil Garner and a two-run single by Foli. Thanks to the unexpected performance from Rooker, a 4–for–4 day from Madlock, and Foli&#x27;s three RBIs, the Pirates had staved off defeat.

Chuck Tanner&#x27;s mother died the morning of Game 5 (this was mentioned during the telecast by announcer Howard Cosell). According to Kent Tukulve, Tanner told the team before the game that his mother was a big Pirates fan, &quot;and she knew we needed some help, so she went to get us some.&quot; The 1960 World Series hero Bill Mazeroski threw out the first ball in Game 5, which would be Three Rivers Stadium&#x27;s final World Series game and, to date, the last World Series game played in Pittsburgh.

===Game 6===
Back home at Memorial Stadium, local baseball coach Mary Dobkin threw out the ceremonial first pitch. The Oriole bats continued to be unexpectedly cold as John Candelaria and Jim Palmer locked into a scoreless duel through six innings. Dave Parker broke the ice with a RBI single in the seventh, followed by a Stargell sacrifice fly. The Pirates added two more runs in the eighth on a Bill Robinson sac fly and a RBI single by Omar Moreno. Kent Tekulve earned his second save of the series.

After the game Howard Cosell in his limo was surrounded and attacked by angry Oriole fans with shaving cream, which prompted Baltimore police to complement his private security for Game 7.

===Game 7===
The Pirates capped an amazing comeback on the strength of Willie Stargell, who went 4–for–5 with a single, two doubles, and a towering two-run homer in the sixth off Scott McGregor. McGregor pitched eight solid innings in a losing cause. For insurance in the ninth, Omar Moreno collected an RBI single, while another run scored when Dave Parker and Bill Robinson were hit by pitches back-to-back, scoring Moreno. Orioles manager Earl Weaver made five pitching changes in the ninth inning in an attempt to keep the game within reach. The O&#x27;s only run came on a Rich Dauer homer in the third, the team&#x27;s only RBI in the last three games (the run in Game 5 scored on a double play, which is not credited as an RBI to the batter). Significantly, Eddie Murray, the Orioles&#x27; main offensive threat, was 0-for-21 in the final five games of the Series, including a fly-out to Parker to end the eighth with the bases loaded (following an intentional walk to Ken Singleton). Following their six run outburst in the eighth inning of Game 4, the Birds scored only two runs on 17 hits over the series final 28 innings. Pirates reliever Grant Jackson got the win after 2 innings after relieving Don Robinson, who had relieved Jim Bibby who lasted four innings and allowed the lone Oriole run.

U.S. President Jimmy Carter made an appearance in Game 7—he threw out the first pitch—and after the game made a visit to the victorious Pittsburgh clubhouse. Prior to the ceremonial first pitch, Bill Schustik played the National Anthem. Pirates closer Kent Tekulve earned a save.

This was the last postseason series won by the Pirates until winning the 2013 National League Wild Card Game. This would also be, as of 2024, the last time the Pirates appeared in a World Series in their history. All five of the Pirates&#x27; World Series victories went the maximum seven games.

The Series was televised by ABC Sports, with play-by-play announcers Keith Jackson (in Baltimore) and Al Michaels (in Pittsburgh), and color commentators Howard Cosell and Don Drysdale. ABC&#x27;s broadcast was also simulcast over the Orioles&#x27; and Pirates&#x27; respective local television outlets, CBS affiliates WMAR-TV in Baltimore and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, in addition to ABC&#x27;s own affiliates WJZ-TV and WTAE-TV.

*In 2006 a &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; DVD box set, featuring the complete ABC telecasts of all seven games, was issued by Major League Baseball and A&amp;E Home Video.

<text>Semi-professional sports are sports in which athletes are not participating on a full-time basis, but still receive some payment. Semi-professionals are not amateur because they receive regular payment from their team, but generally at a considerably lower rate than a full-time professional athlete. As a result, semi-professional players frequently have (or seek) full-time employment elsewhere. A semi-pro player or team could also be one that represents a place of employment that only the employees are allowed to play on. In this case, it is considered semi-pro because their employer pays them, but for their regular job, not for playing on the company&#x27;s team.

The semi-professional status is not universal throughout the world and depends on each country&#x27;s labour code and each sports organization&#x27;s specific regulations.

==Origin==
The San Francisco Olympic Club fielded an American football team in 1890. That year, the Olympic Club was accused by a rival club of enticing athletes to jump to its ranks with offers of jobs. An investigation by the Amateur Athletic Union ruled that the Olympics&#x27; practice was not actually professionalism but only a &quot;semi&quot; form of it, inventing the term &quot;semi-pro&quot;. Although the Amateur Athletic Union did not like the idea very much, it decided that clubs could indeed offer employment without losing their amateur status or compromising the athlete.

==North America==
In North America, semi-professional athletes and teams were far more common in the early and mid-20th century than they are today. Large blue-collar employers such as factories and shipyards often fielded baseball and basketball teams, with players receiving full-time salaries comparable to other employees. In theory, such players split their work week between athletic training and the normal duties of the company&#x27;s employees, though highly competitive teams often evolved into &quot;sponsored&quot; squads which trained for sports full-time and only nominally worked in the factory. The National Industrial Basketball League evolved out of these company-branded basketball teams. By the 1940s, baseball split off into separate truly amateur softball teams, sometimes sponsored by employers, and an expanded system of fully professionalized minor leagues whose lower ranks included many former industrial players.

There are many benefits, such as collegiate eligibility and the attendant scholarships, in maintaining amateur status (unlike the Amateur Athletic Union, the NCAA forbade any sort of compensation outside of scholarships, including job offers tied to their playing, until 2020). Eligibility for participation in the Olympics in some sports is still dependent upon maintaining a purely amateur status (although far less so than was previously the case), and such athletes may be supported by government money, business sponsorships, and other systems. At the same time, professional sports have become such a massive and remunerative business that even many low-level feeder teams can afford to have fully professional athletes.

In Canada, semi-professionalism is prevalent in junior ice hockey, in which the top level players (most of whom are teenagers still in, or just out of, high school) are paid at a semi-professional level. This is not the case in the United States, where college ice hockey dominates at that age group; the junior leagues in the United States generally operate as fully amateur teams to maintain the players&#x27; eligibility to play in college.

Lower-end minor leagues and more obscure sports often operate at a semi-professional level due to cost concerns. Because the cost of running a fully professional American football team is prohibitive, semi-pro football is common at the adult levels, in the outdoor or indoor variety, providing an outlet for players who have used up their NCAA eligibility and have no further use for maintaining amateur status. As a sport that normally plays only one game per week, American football is especially suited for semi-pro play and commonly known as &quot;working man&#x27;s&quot; football; meaning the players have regular jobs and play football on the weekends. In the 20th century the term &quot;semi-pro football league&quot; refer to higher level amateur leagues, though the players do not get paid, the leagues and the games are run in a somewhat professional manner.

The National Lacrosse League, whose teams also typically play only one game per week, pays a salary that is enough to be considered fully professional, but players also are able to pursue outside employment to supplement their income. The lowest levels of organized baseball are also effectively semi-professional, as the short summer seasons and low salaries require players to hold jobs in the offseason to make ends meet.

==United Kingdom==
There are several hundred semi-professional football teams at non-League level. The bottom division of the English Football League (the fourth tier of the English football league system) has traditionally been the cut-off point between professional (&quot;full-time&quot;) and semi-professional (&quot;part-time&quot;) in English football. However, many teams in the top non-League competition, the National League, have become &quot;full-time&quot; professional clubs in an effort to achieve League status. Many former League clubs also remain as fully professional teams following relegation to the lower leagues at least for as long as they retain a large enough average attendance to generate the income needed to pay the players.

Women&#x27;s football in England is semi-professional at the top levels, as finances depend on promotion and relegation both of parent male teams and of the female teams themselves. Full professionalism for women is still in the planning stages; top female players often depend on other sources of income (such as coaching and physical training), and many attend university or college while playing.

In Scottish football, semi-professional teams compete at all levels below the Scottish Premiership, with most teams below the second-level Scottish Championship being semi-professional.

Historically, English rugby league and rugby union have had one full-time professional division, with semi-professional divisions at the next level down. The second tier of union, the RFU Championship, became fully professional beginning with the 2009–10 season.

<text>A volcanic arc (also known as a magmatic arc) is a belt of volcanoes formed above a subducting oceanic tectonic plate, with the belt arranged in an arc shape as seen from above. Volcanic arcs typically parallel an oceanic trench, with the arc located further from the subducting plate than the trench. The oceanic plate is saturated with water, mostly in the form of hydrous minerals such as micas, amphiboles, and serpentines. As the oceanic plate is subducted, it is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature with increasing depth. The heat and pressure break down the hydrous minerals in the plate, releasing water into the overlying mantle. Volatiles such as water drastically lower the melting point of the mantle, causing some of the mantle to melt and form magma at depth under the overriding plate. The magma ascends to form an arc of volcanoes parallel to the subduction zone.

Volcanic arcs are distinct from volcanic chains formed over hotspots in the middle of a tectonic plate. Volcanoes often form one after another as the plate moves over the hotspot, and so the volcanoes progress in age from one end of the chain to the other. The Hawaiian Islands form a typical hotspot chain, with the older islands to the northwest and Hawaii Island itself, which is just 400,000 years old, at the southeast end of the chain over the hotspot. Volcanic arcs do not generally exhibit such a simple age-pattern.

There are two types of volcanic arcs:

* intraoceanic arcs (primitive arcs) form when oceanic crust subducts beneath other oceanic crust on an adjacent plate, creating a volcanic island arc. 
* continental arcs form when oceanic crust subducts beneath continental crust on an adjacent plate, creating an arc-shaped mountain belt.

In some situations, a single subduction zone may show both aspects along its length, as part of a plate subducts beneath a continent and part beneath adjacent oceanic crust. The Aleutian Islands and adjoining Alaskan Peninsula are an example of such a subduction zone.

The active front of a volcanic arc is the belt where volcanism develops at a given time. Active fronts may move over time (millions of years), changing their distance from the oceanic trench as well as their width.

==Tectonic setting==

A volcanic arc is part of an arc-trench complex, which is the part of a subduction zone that is visible at the Earth&#x27;s surface. A subduction zone is where a tectonic plate composed of relatively thin, dense oceanic lithosphere sinks into the Earth&#x27;s mantle beneath a less dense overriding plate. The overriding plate may be either another oceanic plate or a continental plate. The subducting plate, or slab, sinks into the mantle at an angle, so that there is a wedge of mantle between the slab and the overriding plate.

The boundary between the subducting plate and the overriding plate coincides with a deep and narrow oceanic trench. This trench is created by the gravitational pull of the relatively dense subducting plate pulling the leading edge of the plate downward. Multiple earthquakes occur within the subducting slab with the seismic hypocenters located at increasing depth under the island arc: these quakes define the Wadati–Benioff zones. The volcanic arc forms on the overriding plate over the point where the subducting plate reaches a depth of roughly and is a zone of volcanic activity between in width.

The shape of a volcanic arc is typically convex towards the subducting plate. This is a consequence of the spherical geometry of the Earth. The subducting plate behaves like a flexible thin spherical shell, and such a shell be bent downwards by an angle of θ, without tearing or wrinkling, only on a circle whose radius is θ/2. This means that arcs where the subducting slab descends at a shallower angle will be more tightly curved. Prominent arcs whose slabs subduct at about 45 degrees, such as the Kuril Islands, the Aleutian Islands, and the Sunda Arc, have a radius of about 20 to 22 degrees.

Volcanic arcs are divided into those in which the overriding plate is continental (Andean-type arcs) and those in which the overriding plate is oceanic (intraoceanic or primitive arcs). The crust beneath the arc is up to twice as thick as average continental or oceanic crust: The crust under Andean-type arcs is up to thick, while the crust under intraoceanic arcs is thick. Both shortening of the crust and magmatic underplating contribute to thickening of the crust.

Volcanic arcs are characterized by explosive eruption of calc-alkaline magma, though young arcs sometimes erupt tholeiitic magma and a few arcs erupt alkaline magma. Calc-alkaline magma can be distinguished from tholeiitic magma, typical of mid-ocean ridges, by its higher aluminium and lower iron content and by its high content of large-ion lithophile elements, such as potassium, rubidium, caesium, strontium, or barium, relative to high-field-strength elements, such as zirconium, niobium, hafnium, rare-earth elements (REE), thorium, uranium, or tantalum. Andesite is particularly characteristic of volcanic arcs, though it sometimes also occurs in regions of crustal extension.

In the rock record, volcanic arcs can be recognized from their thick sequences of volcaniclastic rock (formed by explosive volcanism) interbedded with greywackes and mudstones and by their calc-alkaline composition. In more ancient rocks that have experienced metamorphism and alteration of their composition (metasomatism), calc-alkaline rocks can be distinguished by their content of trace elements that are little affected by alteration, such as chromium or titanium, whose content is low in volcanic arc rocks. Because volcanic rock is easily weathered and eroded, older volcanic arcs are seen as plutonic rocks, the rocks that formed underneath the arc (e.g. the Sierra Nevada batholith), or in the sedimentary record as lithic sandstones. Paired metamorphic belts, in which a belt of high-temperature, low-pressure metamorphism is located parallel to a belt of low-temperature, high-pressure metamorphism, preserve an ancient arc-trench complex in which the high-temperature, low-pressure belt corresponds to the volcanic arc.

==Petrology==
In a subduction zone, loss of water from the subducted slab induces partial melting of the overriding mantle and generates low-density, calc-alkaline magma that buoyantly rises to intrude and be extruded through the lithosphere of the overriding plate. Most of the water carried downwards by the slab is contained in hydrous (water-bearing) minerals, such as mica, amphibole, or serpentinite minerals. Water is lost from the subducted plate when the temperature and pressure become sufficient to break down these minerals and release their water content. The water rises into the wedge of mantle overlying the slab and lowers the melting point of mantle rock to the point where magma is generated.

While there is wide agreement on the general mechanism, research continues on the explanation for focused volcanism along a narrow arc some distance from the trench. The distance from the trench to the volcanic arc is greater for slabs subducting at a shallower angle, and this suggests that magma generation takes place when the slab reached a critical depth for the breakdown of an abundant hydrous mineral. This would produce an ascending &quot;hydrous curtain&quot; that accounts for focused volcanism along the volcanic arc. However, some models suggest that water is continuously released from the slab from shallow depths down to , and much of the water released at shallow depths produces serpentinization of the overlying mantle wedge. According to one model, only about 18 to 37 percent of the water content is released at sufficient depth to produce arc magmatism. The volcanic arc is then interpreted as the depth at which the degree of melting becomes great enough to allow the magma to separate from its source rock.

It is now known that the subducting slab may be located anywhere from below the volcanic arc, rather than a single characteristic depth of around , which requires more elaborate models of arc magmatism. For example, water released from the slab at moderate depths might react with amphibole minerals in the lower part of the mantle wedge to produce water-rich chlorite. This chlorite-rich mantle rock is then dragged downwards by the subducting slab, and eventually breaks down to become the source of arc magmatism. The location of the arc depends on the angle and rate of subduction, which determine where hydrous minerals break down and where the released water lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle wedge enough for melting.

The location of the volcanic arc may be determined by the presence of a cool shallow corner at the tip of the mantle wedge, where the mantle rock is cooled by both the overlying plate and the slab. Not only does the cool shallow corner suppress melting, but its high stiffness hinders the ascent of any magma that is formed. Arc volcanism takes place where the slab descends out from under the cool shallow corner, allowing magma to be generated and rise through warmer, less stiff mantle rock.

Magma may be generated over a broad area but become focused into a narrow volcanic arc by a permeability barrier at the base of the overriding plate. Numerical simulations suggest that crystallization of rising magma creates this barrier, causing the remaining magma to pool in a narrow band at the apex of the barrier. This narrow band corresponds to the overlying volcanic arc.

==Examples==
Two classic examples of oceanic island arcs are the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific Ocean and the Lesser Antilles in the western Atlantic Ocean. The Cascade Volcanic Arc in western North America and the Andes along the western edge of South America are examples of continental volcanic arcs. The best examples of volcanic arcs with both sets of characteristics are in the North Pacific, with the Aleutian Arc consisting of the Aleutian Islands and their extension the Aleutian Range on the Alaska Peninsula, and the Kuril–Kamchatka Arc comprising the Kuril Islands and southern Kamchatka Peninsula.

<text>The men&#x27;s [[modern pentathlon]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] took place at the Olympic Modern Pentathlon Centre in Goudi Olympic Complex on 26 August. Thirty-two athletes from 20 nations participated in this event.

Although the event was considered wide open, as no other athlete dominated the sport since 2000, the Russians, Lithuanians and Czechs continued to reach the top positions in the men&#x27;s competition. Russia&#x27;s Andrey Moiseev won the gold medal with a score of 5,480 points. Andrejus Zadneprovskis of Lithuania won the nation&#x27;s first ever Olympic medal in modern pentathlon, taking the silver. Libor Capalini of the Czech Republic, on the other hand, claimed the bronze, winning his nation&#x27;s first medal in the sport since Jan Bártů won one for Czechoslovakia in 1976.

==Competition format==
The modern pentathlon consisted of five events, with all five held in one day.

* Shooting: A 4.5 mm air pistol shooting (the athlete must hit 20 shots, one at each target). Score was based on the number of shots hitting at each target.
* Fencing: A round-robin, one-touch épée competition. Score was based on winning percentage.
* Swimming: A 200 m freestyle race. Score was based on time.
* Horse-riding: A show jumping competition. Score based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit.
* Running: A 3 km run. Starts are staggered (based on points from first four events), so that the first to cross the finish line wins.

==Schedule==

==Results==
* Did not finish the riding course because of the exceeding number of obstacle and time penalties

<text>Ninian Park was a football stadium in the Leckwith area of Cardiff, Wales, that was the home of Cardiff City F.C. for 99 years. Opened in 1910 with a single wooden stand, it underwent numerous renovations during its lifespan and hosted fixtures with over 60,000 spectators in attendance. At the time of its closure in 2009, it had a capacity of 21,508.

Cardiff City had originally been playing home fixtures at Sophia Gardens but the lack of facilities at the ground had prevented them from joining the Southern Football League. To combat this, club founder Bartley Wilson secured a plot of land from Cardiff Corporation that had previously been used as a rubbish tip and construction of a new ground began in 1909. The stadium was completed a year later and named Ninian Park after Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who had acted as a financial guarantor for the build. A friendly match against Football League First Division champions Aston Villa was organised to open the ground. It was originally constructed with a single wooden stand and three large banks made of ash, but gradual improvements saw stands constructed on all sides of the pitch. The four stands were named the Canton Stand, the Grange End, the Popular Bank and the Grandstand.

The ground was also used as the home stadium for the Wales national football team from 1911 until the late 1980s, hosting 84 international fixtures during its existence. Safety concerns led to the ground&#x27;s capacity being drastically reduced and Cardiff Arms Park replacing the stadium as the preferred home venue for the national side. The Welsh national side holds the record attendance for a match at Ninian Park; 62,634 fans watched a fixture against England on 17 October 1959. Cardiff City&#x27;s club record attendance of 57,893 came at the stadium during a Football League fixture against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. The ground hosted its last match on 25 April 2009 against Ipswich Town and was demolished soon after, being replaced by the adjacent newly constructed Cardiff City Stadium. The site was converted into a residential housing estate which was completed in 2010.

==History==
===Construction and early years===

Following the founding of the club in 1899, Cardiff City F.C. (originally named Riverside A.F.C.) played their home matches at Sophia Gardens. The club was becoming increasingly popular with local people, but the facilities at Sophia Gardens were deemed inadequate for this growing support due to the lack of turnstiles or an enclosed pitch. The limitations meant the club was forced to turn down an invitation to join the newly formed Southern Football League Second Division in 1908. To capitalise on growing interest, Cardiff organised friendly matches against Crystal Palace, Bristol City and Middlesbrough that were held at Cardiff Arms Park and the Harlequins Ground, part of Cardiff High School. The attendances convinced club founder Bartley Wilson of the potential success of a professional football club in Cardiff, and he approached the Bute Estate, a large landholder within the city, about securing a plot of land to build a new ground at Leckwith Common.

The club was instead offered an area of waste ground by Councillor John Mander which was known as Tanyard Lane with the incentive that Cardiff Corporation would assist in the construction of the ground. Located between Sloper Road and a local railway station, the area had been used previously as a rubbish tip and an allotment ground. The club chose an area of around five acres near a junction on Leckwith Road. They were offered the ground on an initial seven-year lease with a yearly rent of £90. This was to be supported by guarantors should the club have financial difficulties and be unable to maintain payments. Local volunteers and workers were used to clear the site of debris and level the surface. The ground was surrounded by large mounds of ash and slag sourced from the furnaces of local companies and used to form banking for spectators. A white fence was erected around the outside of the ground. A small 200-seat wooden stand and changing rooms were added to complete the build.

To secure the site, the club was required to provide two or more guarantors to back the deal. One of the guarantors who had initially agreed to support the project later pulled out during development. This led the club&#x27;s solicitor, Norman Robertson, to address a local council meeting, stating that &quot;there had been difficulties in obtaining promises of support&quot; due to the uncertain state of the coal industry. Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, son of John Patrick Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, stepped in to offer his financial support. In appreciation of his contribution, the ground was subsequently named Ninian Park, replacing the original planned name Sloper Park. The other four guarantors for the site were David Alfred Thomas, 1st Viscount Rhondda, J. Bell Harrison and local councillors Charles Wall and H.C. Vivian. A further 24 people offered to become sureties if their contribution would be limited to £5.

Harry Bradshaw, secretary of the Southern Football League, inspected the ground ahead of the 1910–11 season. He declared that Ninian Park had &quot;the making of the finest football ground in the country&quot; and allowed Cardiff City to join the Southern League&#x27;s Second Division. Cardiff held two trial matches at the ground, the club&#x27;s professional players competing against its amateur players in preparation for the opening match. The new ground was officially opened at 5:00 pm on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, reigning champions of the Football League First Division, that attracted a crowd of around 7,000 people. The match began with a ceremonial kick-off performed by Lord Ninian and ended in a 2–1 defeat for Cardiff. Jack Evans became the first player to score for the club at the ground. The first competitive match played at Ninian Park was the opening match of the 1910–11 season, which took place three weeks later on 24 September 1910. The match ended in a 4–1 victory for Cardiff over Ton Pentre and attracted a crowd of around 8,000. In November, a larger timber stand that could hold up to 3,000 spectators was built at the Canton end of the ground. Several players who worked as labourers in their spare time helped to complete construction. The stand was extended three years later to cover the length of the pitch.

Less than a year after it opened, Ninian Park was chosen as the new home ground for the Wales national football team, replacing Cardiff Arms Park. It hosted its first international fixture on 6 March 1911, a 2–2 draw against Scotland in front of 17,000 spectators in the 1910–11 British Home Championship. &quot;The Times&quot; described the ground as &quot;primitive&quot; and reported that it had contributed to the poor standard of play. During its formative years, the pitch sometimes bore signs of its former use as a rubbish tip with debris such as glass often rising to the surface. The club paid players 6d an hour to arrive early before matches and help clear the pitch of objects. This approach was not always successful; Scottish international Peter McWilliam suffered a gash to his leg in the first international fixture that ended his playing career, and Wales&#x27; Billy Meredith also suffered a cut knee during the match. Cardiff&#x27;s Jack Evans was scarred for life in a similar incident in a later match when a piece of glass cut his knee. In the early years at the stadium, the ground contained only one changing room and washing area, meaning home and away teams shared facilities. This continued until a separate dressing room was constructed in 1913. A local primary school, originally named Virgil Street Board School, adopted the name of the ground in 1911, becoming Ninian Park Primary School.

===Football League and development===

Cardiff won promotion from the Second Division of the Southern Football League to the First Division in 1912–13. Following the resumption of league football after the First World War, the team&#x27;s fourth-placed finish in the 1919–20 season raised enough income to eliminate the club&#x27;s debts. This also allowed for the construction of an all-seater stand at Ninian Park behind the north goal which was named the Canton Stand. In 1920, Cardiff was elected to the Second Division of The Football League, helping attendances increase significantly. Matches against well known clubs in the top two divisions of the English football league system attracted considerable interest, with attendances averaging over 28,000 in the Second Division. Further improvements were implemented after this first season in The Football League; a roof was erected over the new Canton Stand, the spectator banks were raised and the pitch was relaid with sea-washed turf, a fine variety of grass grown on the coast that is cleansed by tidal flow. The club stated that the new playing surface was &quot;now equal to the best in the country.&quot; Attendances rose again as Cardiff won promotion to the First Division after one season. The opening match of the 1921–22 season attracted a crowd of over 55,000 for a 1–0 defeat by Tottenham Hotspur. The turnstiles were closed once 50,000 spectators had been let into the ground, but the remaining crowds outside, still queuing for entry, forced open the exit gates and entered the ground. Club estimates put the attendance at between 56,000 and 60,000, with spectators even climbing the scoreboard to gain a vantage point.

In 1923, plans were initiated to build new dressing rooms and offices at the ground but the project proved too costly. This was partly due to the expense of replacing the sea-washed turf, which had proved troublesome and had been described as &quot;treacherous&quot; in the two years since it had been installed. The pitch at the ground would prove problematic for several seasons and the club eventually enlisted the help of seed specialists Suttons to improve the quality of the surface. Victory in the 1927 FA Cup Final raised enough funds for a roof to be erected over the terrace at the Grangetown end of the ground. Built by local company Connies &amp; Meaden Limited, it was officially opened on 1 September 1928 before a league match against Burnley by the Lord Mayor of Cardiff, Arthur John Howell. It could hold 18,000 spectators. The investment in the stadium proved detrimental to the team as manager Fred Stewart was left with little money to reinvest in an ageing squad. Replacements were sourced from amateur clubs, but the side was relegated to the Football League Third Division South by 1932. With the club&#x27;s finances dwindling, the board was keen to add new revenue streams. Boxing matches were soon held at Ninian Park with the first professional event in August 1931 featuring former British light-heavyweight champion Frank Moody. The 1932 Cardiff Sports Carnival was also based at the ground, which included the final of the 12-mile road race finishing with three laps around the stands. The idea of installing a greyhound track at the stadium was also proposed the same year but was met with opposition from council and footballing authorities before being abandoned.

On 18 January 1937, the main stand caught fire after thieves attempted to break into the club&#x27;s safe using explosives. They mistakenly believed that money taken from gate receipts in an FA Cup tie against Grimsby Town was stored inside. The match had attracted a season-high attendance of more than 36,000 spectators leading to higher than usual income. The fire was discovered at 3:45 am by a local policeman. He alerted the fire brigade but they were unable to douse the fire before it destroyed the stand, the dressing rooms and offices. It also claimed the lives of the club&#x27;s watchdog Jack as well as one of the club&#x27;s cats and destroyed the majority of its historical records. The stand was largely destroyed in the blaze but was rebuilt using a brick and stone construction before the outbreak of World War II. Prior to the return of The Football League after the war, Ninian Park hosted its first European opposition when Dynamo Moscow played Cardiff as part of a tour of the United Kingdom in 1945. Cardiff, chosen for being deemed the leading club in Wales, suffered a heavy 10–1 defeat to the visiting side but did earn a substantial profit from ticket sales.
Over the following few decades, several areas of the ground underwent significant renovations. The main stand was extended in 1947 at a cost of £9,000, with a new concrete terrace being added in front of the original seating area. Floodlights were added to the ground for the first time in 1960. Ninian Park was one of the last Football League grounds to have them installed. During this period the club&#x27;s popularity had increased as they challenged for a return to the First Division. On 27 August 1949, Cardiff sold 60,855 tickets for a South Wales derby match against Swansea Town but only 57,510 entered the ground on the day. Their record attendance for a match was set four years later, on 22 April 1953, when a crowd of 57,893 watched a First Division match against Arsenal.

In February 1958, the ground was host to the second leg of the 1958 FIFA World Cup play-off qualifying match between Wales and Israel. Already leading 2–0 from the first leg, Wales secured a second victory by the same scoreline to reach the World Cup finals for the only time in the team&#x27;s history. Later that year, Connies &amp; Meaden were employed again to construct a large roof over the rear section of the Popular Bank and to extend the stand the length of the pitch. In the early 1960s, qualification for the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup by virtue of winning the Welsh Cup was introduced and Cardiff entered European competition for the first time in the 1964–65 season. The side were drawn against Danish semi-professional team Esbjerg fB and the first European tie held at Ninian Park took place on 13 October for the second leg of the fixture. After a goalless draw in the first leg, Peter King scored the only goal of the tie to secure a 1–0 aggregate victory for Cardiff in front of a crowd of around 9,000. The low crowd was blamed on the relatively unknown status of the opposition; the club&#x27;s match against Portuguese side Sporting CP, reigning champions of the competition, in the following round attracted over 23,000 spectators, the biggest home crowd the club had played in front of for nearly two years. This was bettered again in the following round when 38,458 supporters attended a 1–0 defeat against Spanish side Real Zaragoza.

As the club&#x27;s fortunes declined during the 1960s crowd numbers fell, but during the 1972–73 season Cardiff spent £225,000 extending the main stand capacity by a further 4,500 seats under the stewardship of new chairman David Goldstone. In 1975, the Safety of Sports Grounds Act was introduced, and two years later local authorities introduced sanctions on Ninian Park that saw the capacity reduced from 46,000 to just 10,000 over safety concerns. The club was forced to pay £600,000 towards improving the ground&#x27;s safety features to ensure that Ninian Park could be maintained and awarded the necessary safety certificate. A sum of £200,000 was provided by the Football Grounds Improvement Trust and £27,000 by the Football Association of Wales (FAW). The Safety Act also required that the Grange End Stand be overhauled. This included the demolition of the roof, and the removal of banking that severely reduced the overall capacity of the ground. Director Tony Clemo later complained that the restrictions were unduly harsh, stating &quot;There was no common sense [...] the Grangetown Stand had to be demolished in 1978 when the council&#x27;s safety officers said that if there was two feet of snow and an 80 mile an hour wind blowing, it would be unsafe. We maintained that if there were two feet of snow and an 80 mile and hour wind, we wouldn&#x27;t be playing football anyway! They insisted and down it came! It was a total waste of time and money.&quot; The club did benefit from a relationship with engineering firm Kenton Utilities who undertook most of the work at a reduced rate due to the firm being owned by another Cardiff director, Bob Grogan.

During a qualifying match between Wales and Scotland for the 1986 FIFA World Cup on 10 September 1985, Scotland manager Jock Stein collapsed at the ground after suffering a heart-attack during the final minutes of the match. He was taken to the ground&#x27;s medical room where he received treatment, but doctors were unable to revive him. In memory of Stein, a plaque was installed in one of the dugouts at the ground.

===Downscaling, closure and demolition===
In the late 1980s, increasing concerns over safety issues saw Ninian Park replaced as the main home venue of the Wales national side by Cardiff Arms Park. A few matches were played there until it hosted its final international fixture, a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying match on 14 October 1998 against Belarus. In January 1990, the club was dealt a blow when thieves broke into the stadium following an FA Cup tie against Queens Park Rangers. They stole £50,000 of gate receipts by gaining access to offices via the pitch. The money was eventually recovered. Some was found in the house of one of the perpetrators; the majority was found buried on Caerphilly Mountain. Later the same year, the FAW chose to move a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying match between Wales and Belgium to Cardiff Arms Park over fears that proposed safety improvements at Ninian Park would not be completed in time. FAW secretary Alun Evans alluded to the fact that matches between Belgium and the Home Nations were still deemed to be &quot;sensitive&quot; following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985. Cardiff threatened legal action over the decision, stating that the club could &quot;meet any deadline&quot; to complete the work, but were unsuccessful. The game went ahead at Cardiff Arms Park.

With Cardiff struggling financially and owing several payments to their landlords the City of Cardiff Council, the club was forced to close three stands in the ground to save on policing costs during matches. The closure remained in place for a year until Rick Wright acquired control of the club and invested heavily in updating the ground. Improvements included installing 2,100 seats and extending the roof in the Grandstand, replacing terracing in the Popular Bank with 5,330 seats and refurbishing the Grange End and the Canton Stand, which added a further 1,761 seats. Wright decided to sell his stake in the club in 1993 and a feasibility study of Ninian Park carried out by Tarmac Group on behalf of a prospective buyer estimated that the redevelopment of the ground would cost an estimated £4.6 million. The increasingly dilapidated nature of the ground gained national attention following Cardiff&#x27;s victory over Leeds United in the FA Cup in January 2002 due to crowd trouble after the match. Jeff Cooksley, Chief Superintendent of South Wales Police, commented that, although no objection was made to using the ground, Ninian Park was a &quot;very old ground, [...] and is very poorly designed compared with modern standards.&quot;
Plans for a new stadium to replace Ninian Park were in development for several years before Cardiff City officially submitted an application to local councils. Welsh Rugby Union chief executive David Moffett originally objected to the proposals as he wished for the club to use the Millennium Stadium as their home ground instead to maximise the occupancy levels of the stadium. The plans for a 30,000-seat stadium, with the potential to expand to 60,000, were eventually approved by Cardiff council, and plans were submitted in 2006. Work started on the new Cardiff City Stadium at the end of 2007 on the site of the Cardiff Athletics Stadium at an expected cost of £38 million.
The last football match played by Cardiff at Ninian Park was a 3–0 defeat by Ipswich Town on 25 April 2009. The final senior player to score at the ground was Jon Stead, then of Ipswich Town; the last player for Cardiff to score at the ground was Ross McCormack in a 3–1 victory over Burnley in the penultimate senior game at Ninian Park. After the final match, an online memorabilia auction was setup, with items such as goalposts, office furniture and supporters&#x27; seats being listed for sale. In July 2009, the gates of the Ninian Park ground were re-erected opposite the stadium site, though minus one of the bluebird logos which had gone missing following the final match.
The stadium was handed over to Redrow Homes by Cardiff chairman Peter Ridsdale on 10 September 2009. The 99-year-old Ninian Park was demolished later in 2009 to make way for a housing development. Redrow built 142 houses on the site, intending to retain the name Ninian Park.
A planted square was proposed at the centre of the new housing development, in the area of Ninian Park&#x27;s centre spot. The first show home of the £24 million development was opened in late spring 2010, with a mixture of terraced, detached and semi-detached houses. The first families moved into the new housing in November 2010. After completion, the road through the development was named Bartley Wilson Way after the founder of Cardiff City.

==Structure and facilities==
At the time of its closure in 2009, Ninian Park had a capacity of 21,508 and comprised four stands; the Grandstand, the Grange End, the Popular Bank and the Canton Stand.
The Grandstand was an all-seated stand that was built before the Second World War to replace the original wooden structure that had been destroyed in a fire. The stand had originally contained a standing section at the bottom, but this was later converted to seats. Press areas reserved for journalists had been located in the stand since 1960. Directly opposite was the Popular Bank, which was commonly referred to as the &quot;Bob Bank&quot; as it previously cost one shilling (known as one bob) to enter. It was originally an all-standing construction with no roof on its completion in 1910. A roof was constructed in 1958, and the top half of the stand was converted to seating in the early 1990s. The Popular Bank became well known for the advertising featured on the roof of the stand. In 1960, an advert for Captain Morgan rum, named after Sir Henry Morgan who hailed from Cardiff, was painted on the roof and remained in place for 42 years. The advert was the longest running stadium roof advert in the history of The Football League. It was replaced in 2001 by an advert for Hyper Value.

The Grange End and Canton Stand were both named after local districts in the city, Grangetown and Canton. The Grange End also housed visiting away fans and due to crowd trouble, had featured a fence to separate opposing fans and netting to stop objects being thrown. It was removed in 2006, becoming the last venue in the Football League to remove fencing between opposing fans. The Canton Stand also housed executive boxes, hospitality areas and several club offices. These areas had originally been commissioned in the 1980s but financial difficulties at the club delayed the completion of the project until 2001. The ground featured floodlights in each corner and a plasma-screen television showed highlights during the game. The television was bought by the club in 2002 from Bolton Wanderers. They had used the screen in their former ground Burnden Park before moving to the Reebok Stadium. It was located between the Popular Bank and the Grange End.

==Transport==

The stadium and surrounding area was served by Ninian Park railway station (on the Cardiff City Line) on one side of Sloper Road and Grangetown railway station (on the Vale Line) on the other side. Ninian Park Station (originally named Ninian Park Halt) was built in 1912 by the Taff Vale Railway at the junction of Sloper Road and Leckwith Road. Railway officials had been encouraged by increasing crowd numbers at the club&#x27;s matches and looked to capitalise on the interest. When the railway was privatised, the stations became part of the Valley Lines. Trains operated frequently to Central and Queen Street stations. By road, the stadium was also served by the A4232 dual carriageway, which is approximately away from the Leckwith Interchange.

==Other usage==
===Sporting events===
====Rugby====
Cardiff Rugby Club played at Ninian Park twice between 1960 and 1961 as their ground did not have floodlights. The Cardiff City Blue Dragons rugby league team used the ground as their home between 1981 and 1984. The team had been founded by Cardiff City director Bob Grogan as a way of generating income and ensuring that Ninian Park was being used more frequently. Initially the project proved a moderate success. Having been set up at a cost of less than £50,000, the side was credited with keeping the football club afloat by former Cardiff director Tony Clemo, who commented &quot;We weren&#x27;t getting many through the gates but rugby league helped to keep Cardiff City going [...] The Blue Dragons income was paying the rents and rates and there was always a small profit at the end of the day.&quot; The team&#x27;s first match against Salford on 31 August 1981 attracted more than 9,000 spectators. However, the Blue Dragons failed to reach the top tier of Rugby league and crowds dropped to below 1,000 by the end of the first season. Grogan&#x27;s death soon after led to the club folding after a year playing in Bridgend.

The Welsh national rugby league team, the Wales Dragons, used Ninian Park as one of its home venues. The ground hosted seven internationals between 1981 and 1995 with the first match a 15–20 defeat to England in November 1981. Ahead of the game, rugby officials had hoped to draw a crowd of more than 10,000 but the final figure was around 8,000. The Dragons held a 3–3 record at Ninian Park, winning their last game 28–6 over France before the largest international rugby league crowd at the ground (a sellout 10,250) on their way to a semi-final berth in the 1995 Rugby League World Cup. The 1999 final of the WRU Challenge Cup was also held at the ground, featuring Swansea RFC defeating Llanelli RFC 37–10.

====Other====

Cardiff-born boxer Jack Petersen fought at the ground on several occasions, including victories over Hein Müller and George Cook that attracted crowds of more than 40,000. The ground also hosted several boxing World title fights; Ronnie James contested the first World title fight ever held in Wales when he fought American Ike Williams for the NBA Lightweight Title in September 1946. The bout lasted until the ninth round when reigning champion Williams knocked James out in front of a crowd of 45,000 people. Howard Winstone&#x27;s rematch against reigning WBC and WBA featherweight champion Vicente Saldivar was also held at Ninian Park; Salvidar claimed a narrow victory over Winstone by half a point.

During the 1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games held in Cardiff, Ninian Park hosted the show jumping championships, although the sport was only an exhibition event at the games. A trial event to inform 1960 Summer Olympics equestrian team selection was also hosted at the ground in May 1960. Other sporting uses included hosting an exhibition basketball game between the Harlem Globetrotters and the United States Star Basketeers Team in June 1958 and an American football match featuring the Cardiff Tigers team in 1986.

===Concerts===
The ground has been used for numerous other events. Pope John Paul II visited the city on 2 June 1982, touring several locations, appearing at a National Youth Rally held at Ninian Park attended by 35,000 people. As part of his Rastaman Vibration Tour, reggae singer Bob Marley staged a concert at the ground on 19 June 1976 for the West Coast Rock Show. He was supported by Country Joe and the Fish and Eric Burdon among others. The concert had originally been scheduled for Stephen Stills. When he was unable to play, Marley filled the date.

==Records==
The highest attendance recorded at the ground is 62,634, for a match between Wales and England on 17 October 1959 in the 1959–60 British Home Championship. Cardiff City&#x27;s record attendance at the ground was 57,893 during a league fixture against Arsenal on 22 April 1953. Although a match against Swansea Town in August 1949 sold 60,855 tickets only an attendance of 57,510 was recorded through the turnstiles on the day. The ground holds the record for the highest attendance for a Welsh Cup match after 37,500 fans watched Cardiff defeat Swansea Town 3–2 in the 1956 final. It also holds the record for the highest non-final Welsh Cup attendance with 22,500 fans attending a semifinal between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil in 1949.

The highest season average attendance record was set during the 1952–53 season with 37,937. The lowest season average was recorded in the 1986–87 season with 2,856. That season also included the club&#x27;s lowest ever home attendance for a fixture in the Football League when 1,510 fans attended a match against Hartlepool United on 7 May.

<text>Enduring Love is a 2004 psychological thriller film directed by Roger Michell and written by Joe Penhall. It is based on the 1997 novel of the same name by Ian McEwan. The film stars Daniel Craig, Rhys Ifans, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Susan Lynch and Corin Redgrave.

&quot;Enduring Love&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2004, by Pathé. Reviews were mixed.

==Plot==
Joe has planned an afternoon in the English countryside with his girlfriend, Claire. As they prepare to open a bottle of champagne, a hot air balloon drifts into the field. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down.

Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket. Just as they grab on, wind rushes into the field, and at once the rescuers are airborne. Joe manages to drop to the ground, as do the others, except for one who is lifted into the sky. They watch as the man falls to his death.

Recalling the events at dinner with his friends Robin, Rachel, and Claire, Joe reveals the impact the incident has had on his battered psyche. The balloon eventually landed safely, the boy unscathed. Joe later goes to retrieve the body of the fallen man with fellow rescuer Jed Parry. Jed feels an instant connection with Joe—one that, as the weeks go by, becomes ever more intense.

Days later, Joe, feeling guilty, spends time trying to map out ways that could have saved the man. One day, he receives a phone call from Jed, telling him to come outside so that they can talk about what happened. Joe looks out of the window and sees Jed standing across the road from his house staring up at Joe&#x27;s window. Joe is reluctant but Jed promises that he will leave Joe alone if he comes outside and talks to him. After Jed makes some comments that make Joe uneasy, he decides to leave, telling Jed to leave him alone.

Not too long after this, Joe visits a local bookshop where Jed shows up, appearing to have followed him. Joe is confused, though tries to appease Jed, but Jed pursues Joe, telling him to &quot;be brave.&quot; Joe is left rattled, troubled by thoughts of that day in the field.

Joe goes to visit the wife of the man who had died. She tells him she believes her husband was having an affair after the police returned a picnic basket for two found in his car, along with an unknown woman&#x27;s scarf. After hearing this, Joe decides to work out who was with the man on the day he died.

Joe becomes more consumed with the balloon incident, growing distant in his personal life. Jed continues to show up in Joe&#x27;s personal spaces, sitting outside Joe&#x27;s apartment, asking Joe to admit to what passed between them in the field, suggesting Joe is sending Jed messages by opening and closing his curtains. After Jed shows up at Joe&#x27;s job one day, Joe publicly threatens Jed and tells him he does not want to see him at all.

Joe increasingly unravels, his behavior alienating those around him. After waking Claire to a middle-of-the-night raving, Claire eventually tells Joe it is over between them. Angry, Joe pays a visit to Jed and they argue. Jed bashes his head against the wall. Joe then gets drunk before going to Robin and Rachel&#x27;s house, where he stays the night. When he wakes, his friend tells him Claire just called and asked Joe to come over as Jed is at their house.

Joe races home and enters the living room, finding Jed and Claire sitting next to each other on the sofa. Jed looks as if he has been beaten up and falsely blames Joe. Claire appears to believe Jed&#x27;s story. Joe loses his temper when out of the blue, Jed stabs Claire with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor, bleeding profusely. Joe then pretends to accept Jed into his life and they kiss. As they kiss, Joe grabs hold of the knife from Jed and stabs him. Jed falls to the floor, while Joe rushes to Claire&#x27;s aid and phones an ambulance.

Joe returns to the field where it all started, with the wife and daughter of the man who died. They are joined by a couple who explain that the woman&#x27;s husband had not cheated on her but was giving the couple a lift in his car. The picnic basket and scarf were theirs, and they were too embarrassed to get involved, as &quot;they&quot; were having an affair. In the field, Joe tells the man&#x27;s daughter her father was very brave.

As the end credits roll, a scene in a psychiatric hospital reveals Jed alive, sitting at a desk writing. He turns to the camera and smiles.

==Critical response==
The film received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes assigned the film a score of based on reviews. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;While it strains credibility and isn&#x27;t ultimately as profound as it might first appear, &quot;Enduring Love&quot; is still an intriguing thriller fueled by strong performances from Rhys Ifans and Daniel Craig.&quot;
&quot;Empire&quot;, however, voted it number 426 on their list of the 500 greatest films ever made.

At RogerEbert.com, the film received 3 of 4 stars. The reviewer points out the film is among the few dealing with the fact that sometimes, we have a choice about what happens and how we react. It causes the viewer to ask, What would I have done?
The Guardian&#x27;s Rob Mackie describes the film&#x27;s opening scene as startling and beautifully shot, a &#x27;vivid, colourful scene - bright red balloon, bright blue sky, bright green grass.&#x27; This is contrasted with the subsequently muted and downbeat. Giving the film a 3 out of 5 stars, he describes it as a &#x27;thoughtful philosophical inquiry (which) becomes a less convincing thriller&#x27;. It &#x27;intrigues but ultimately disappoints&#x27;.
Calling the film a &#x27;jokeless gloomarama,&#x27; The New Yorker&#x27;s Anthony Lane wrote, &#x27;The ideas behind “Enduring Love” may be fascinating, but they don&#x27;t play; they sulk.&#x27; He feels the lack of grip persists to the finale and the climax feels clenched and ridiculous.
Giving the film a 4 out of 5 stars, Nev Pierce of BBC News Online describes the film as, &#x27;An intelligent and gripping dramatic thriller, Enduring Love is a real rarity: a film better than the book.&#x27; While admitting it isn&#x27;t flawless, he calls it both ambitious and vigorous, and worthy of viewers&#x27; attention.

<text>Nitrazepam, sold under the brand name Mogadon among others, is a hypnotic drug of the benzodiazepine class used for short-term relief from severe, disabling anxiety and insomnia. It also has sedative (calming) properties, as well as amnestic (inducing forgetfulness), anticonvulsant, and skeletal muscle relaxant effects.
It was first synthesized in the late 1950s by a team of researchers at Hoffmann-La Roche in Switzerland. It was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1965.
==Medical use==

Nitrazepam is used to treat short-term sleeping problems (insomnia), namely difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakening, or a combination of each.

Nitrazepam is sometimes tried to treat epilepsy when other medications fail. It has been found to be more effective than clonazepam in the treatment of West syndrome, which is an age-dependent epilepsy, affecting the very young. In uncontrolled studies, nitrazepam has shown effectiveness in infantile spasms and is sometimes considered when other anti-seizure drugs have failed. However, drowsiness, hypotonia, and most significantly tolerance to anti-seizure effects typically develop with long-term treatment, generally limiting Nitrazepam to acute seizure management.

A light-activated derivative of nitrazepam (fulgazepam) has been developed for research purposes.

==Side effects==

===More common===
More common side effects may include: central nervous system depression, including somnolence, dizziness, depressed mood, fatigue, ataxia, headache, vertigo, impairment of memory, impairment of motor functions, a &quot;hungover&quot; feeling in the morning, slurred speech, decreased physical performance, numbed emotions, reduced alertness, muscle weakness, double vision, and inattention have been reported. Unpleasant dreams and rebound insomnia have also been reported.

Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with an elimination half-life of 15–38 hours (mean elimination half-life 26 hours). Residual &quot;hangover&quot; effects after nighttime administration of nitrazepam such as sleepiness, impaired psychomotor and cognitive functions may persist into the next day, which may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increases the risk of falls and hip fractures.

===Less common===
Less common side effects may include: Hypotension, faintness, palpitation, rash or pruritus, gastrointestinal disturbances, and changes in libido are less common. Very infrequently, paradoxical reactions may occur, for example, excitement, stimulation, hallucinations, hyperactivity, and insomnia. Also, depressed or increased dreaming, disorientation, severe sedation, retrograde amnesia, headache, hypothermia, and delirium tremens are reported. Severe liver toxicity has also been reported.

===Cancer===
Benzodiazepine use is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer.
However, conflicting evidence implies that further research is needed in order to conclude that products of this class really do induce cancer.

===Mortality===
Nitrazepam therapy, compared with other drug therapies, increases risk of death when used for intractable epilepsy in an analysis of 302 patients. The risk of death from nitrazepam therapy may be greater in younger patients (children below 3.4 years in the study) with intractable epilepsy. In older children (above 3.4 years), the tendency appears to be reversed in this study. Nitrazepam may cause sudden death in children. It can cause swallowing incoordination, high-peaked esophageal peristalsis, bronchospasm, delayed cricopharyngeal relaxation, and severe respiratory distress necessitating ventilatory support in children. Nitrazepam may promote the development of parasympathetic overactivity or vagotonia, leading to potentially fatal respiratory distress in children.

===Liver===
Nitrazepam has been associated with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, nimetazepam, flunitrazepam, and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.

===Other long-term effects===

Long-term use of nitrazepam may carry mental and physical health risks, such as the development of cognitive deficits. These adverse effects show improvement after a period of abstinence.
Some other sources however seem to indicate that there is no relation between the use of benzodiazepine medication and dementia. Further research is needed in order to assert that this class of medication does really induce cognitive decline.

===Abuse potential===

Recreational use of nitrazepam is common.

A monograph for the drug says: &quot;Treatment with nitrazepam should usually not exceed seven to ten consecutive days. Use for more than two to three consecutive weeks requires complete re-evaluation of the patient. Prescriptions for nitrazepam should be written for short-term use (seven to ten days) and it should not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply. Dependence can occur in as little as four weeks.&quot;

===Tolerance===
Tolerance to nitrazepam&#x27;s effects often appears with regular use. Increased levels of GABA in cerebral tissue and alterations in the activity state of the serotoninergic system occur as a result of nitrazepam tolerance.
Tolerance to the sleep-inducing effects of nitrazepam can occur after about seven days; tolerance also frequently occurs to its anticonvulsant effects.

However, other sources indicate that continuous use does not necessarily lead to reduced effectiveness, which implies that tolerance is not automatic and that not all patients exhibit tolerance to the same extent.

====Dependence and withdrawal====

Nitrazepam can cause dependence, addiction, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Withdrawal from nitrazepam may lead to withdrawal symptoms which are similar to those seen with alcohol and barbiturates. Common withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, concentration problems, and fatigue. Discontinuation of nitrazepam produced rebound insomnia after short-term single nightly dose therapy.

==Special precautions==
Benzodiazepines require special precautions if used in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals and individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders. Caution should be exercised in prescribing nitrazepam to anyone who is of working age due to the significant impairment of psychomotor skills; this impairment is greater when the higher dosages are prescribed.

Nitrazepam in doses of 5 mg or more causes significant deterioration in vigilance performance combined with increased feelings of sleepiness. Nitrazepam at doses of 5 mg or higher impairs driving skills and like other hypnotic drugs, it is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. In the elderly, nitrazepam is associated with an increased risk of falls and hip fractures due to impairments of body balance. The elimination half-life of nitrazepam is 40 hours in the elderly and 29 hours in younger adults. Nitrazepam is commonly taken in overdose by drug abusers or suicidal individuals, sometimes leading to death. Nitrazepam is teratogenic if taken in overdose during pregnancy with 30% of births showing congenital abnormalities. It is a popular drug of abuse in countries where it is available.

Doses as low as 5 mg can impair driving skills. Therefore, people driving or conducting activities which require vigilance should exercise caution in using nitrazepam or possibly avoid it altogether.

===Elderly===
Nitrazepam, similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines, causes impairments in body balance and standing steadiness in individuals who wake up at night or the next morning. Falls and hip fractures are frequently reported. Combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments. Nitrazepam has been found to be dangerous in elderly patients due to a significantly increased risk of falls. This increased risk is probably due to the drug effects of nitrazepam persisting well into the next day. Nitrazepam is a particularly unsuitable hypnotic for the elderly as it induces a disability characterised by general mental deterioration, inability to walk, incontinence, dysarthria, confusion, stumbling, falls, and disoriention which can occur from doses as low as 5 mg. The nitrazepam-induced symptomatology can lead to a misdiagnosis of brain disease in the elderly, for example dementia, and can also lead to the symptoms of postural hypotension which may also be misdiagnosed. A geriatric unit reportedly was seeing as many as seven patients a month with nitrazepam-induced disabilities and health problems. The drug was recommended to join the barbiturates in not being prescribed to the elderly. Only nitrazepam and lorazepam were found to increase the risk of falls and fractures in the elderly. CNS depression occurs much more frequently in the elderly and is especially common in doses above 5 mg of nitrazepam. Both young and old patients report sleeping better after three nights&#x27; use of nitrazepam, but they also reported feeling less awake and were slower on psychomotor testing up to 36 hours after intake of nitrazepam. The elderly showed cognitive deficits, making significantly more mistakes in psychomotor testing than younger patients despite similar plasma levels of the drug, suggesting the elderly are more sensitive to nitrazepam due to increased sensitivity of the aging brain to it. Confusion and disorientation can result from chronic nitrazepam administration to elderly subjects. Also, the effects of a single dose of nitrazepam may last up to 60 hours after administration.

===Children===
Nitrazepam is not recommended for use in those under 18 years of age. Use in very young children may be especially dangerous. Children treated with nitrazepam for epilepsies may develop tolerance within months of continued use, with dose escalation often occurring with prolonged use. Sleepiness, deterioration in motor skills and ataxia were common side effects in children with tuberous sclerosis treated with nitrazepam. The side effects of nitrazepam may impair the development of motor and cognitive skills in children treated with nitrazepam. Withdrawal only occasionally resulted in a return of seizures and some children withdrawn from nitrazepam appeared to improve. Development, for example the ability to walk at five years of age, was impaired in many children taking nitrazepam, but was not impaired with several other nonbenzodiazepine antiepileptic agents. Children being treated with nitrazepam have been recommended to be reviewed and have their nitrazepam gradually discontinued whenever appropriate. Excess sedation, hypersalivation, swallowing difficulty, and high incidence of aspiration pneumonia, as well as several deaths, have been associated with nitrazepam therapy in children.

===Pregnancy===

Nitrazepam is not recommended during pregnancy as it is associated with causing a neonatal withdrawal syndrome and is not generally recommended in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals or people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The Dutch, British and French system called the System of Objectified Judgement Analysis for assessing whether drugs should be included in drug formularies based on clinical efficacy, adverse effects, pharmacokinetic properties, toxicity, and drug interactions was used to assess nitrazepam. A Dutch analysis using the system found nitrazepam to be unsuitable in drug-prescribing formularies.

The use of nitrazepam during pregnancy can lead to intoxication of the newborn. A neonatal withdrawal syndrome can also occur if nitrazepam or other benzodiazepines are used during pregnancy with symptoms such as hyperexcitability, tremor, and gastrointestinal upset (diarrhea or vomiting) occurring. Breast feeding by mothers using nitrazepam is not recommended. Nitrazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine with a risk of drug accumulation, though no active metabolites are formed during metabolism. Accumulation can occur in various body organs, including the heart; accumulation is even greater in babies. Nitrazepam rapidly crosses the placenta and is present in breast milk in high quantities. Therefore, benzodiazepines including nitrazepam should be avoided during pregnancy. In early pregnancy, nitrazepam levels are lower in the baby than in the mother, and in the later stages of pregnancy, nitrazepam is found in equal levels in both the mother and the unborn child. Internationally benzodiazepines are known to cause harm when used during pregnancy and nitrazepam is a category D drug during pregnancy.

Benzodiazepines are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes, so rapidly penetrate the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam in late pregnancy in especially high doses may result in floppy infant syndrome. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in the development of a severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in the neonate. Withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines in the neonate may include hypotonia, and reluctance to suckle, to apnoeic spells, cyanosis, and impaired metabolic responses to cold stress. These symptoms may persist for hours or months after birth.

===Other precautions===
====Caution in hypotension====

Caution in those suffering from hypotension, nitrazepam may worsen hypotension.

====Caution in hypothyroidism====

Caution should be exercised by people who have hypothyroidism, as this condition may cause a long delay in the metabolism of nitrazepam leading to significant drug accumulation.

==Contraindications==
Nitrazepam should be avoided in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), especially during acute exacerbations of COPD, because serious respiratory depression may occur in patients receiving hypnotics.

As with other hypnotic drugs, nitrazepam is associated with an increased risk of traffic accidents. Nitrazepam is recommended to be avoided in patients who drive or operate machinery. A study assessing driving skills of sedative hypnotic users found the users of nitrazepam to be significantly impaired up to 17 hours after dosing, whereas users of temazepam did not show significant impairments of driving ability. These results reflect the long-acting nature of nitrazepam.

== Interactions ==

Nitrazepam interacts with the antibiotic erythromycin, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, which affects concentration peak time. Alone, this interaction is not believed to be clinically important. However, anxiety, tremor, and depression were documented in a case report involving a patient undergoing treatment for acute pneumonia and renal failure. Following administration of nitrazepam, triazolam, and subsequently erythromycin, the patient experienced repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations. Coadministration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in persons with other, significant physical complications.

Oral contraceptive pills reduce the clearance of nitrazepam, which may lead to increased plasma levels of nitrazepam and accumulation.
Rifampin significantly increases the clearance of nitrazepam, while probenecid significantly decreases its clearance. Cimetidine slows down the elimination rate of nitrazepam, leading to more prolonged effects and increased risk of accumulation. Alcohol in combination with nitrazepam may cause a synergistic enhancement of the hypotensive properties of both benzodiazepines and alcohol. Benzodiazepines including nitrazepam may inhibit the glucuronidation of morphine, leading to increased levels and prolongation of the effects of morphine in rat experiments.

==Pharmacology==
Nitrazepam is a nitrobenzodiazepine. It is a 1,4 benzodiazepine, with the chemical name &quot;1,3-Dihydro-7-nitro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4- benzodiazepin-2-one&quot;.

It is long acting, lipophilic, and metabolised hepatically by oxidative pathways. It acts on benzodiazepine receptors in the brain which are associated with the GABA receptors, causing an enhanced binding of GABA to GABAA receptors. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, involved in inducing sleepiness, muscular relaxation, and control of anxiety and seizures, and slows down the central nervous system. Nitrazepam is similar in action to the z-drug zopiclone prescribed for insomnia. The anticonvulsant properties of nitrazepam and other benzodiazepines may be in part or entirely due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation in mouse spinal cord cell cultures. The muscle relaxant properties of nitrazepam are produced via inhibition of polysynaptic pathways in the spinal cord of decerebrate cats. It is a full agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor. The endogenous opioid system may play a role in some of the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam in rats. Nitrazepam causes a decrease in the cerebral contents of the amino acids glycine and alanine in the mouse brain. The decrease may be due to activation of benzodiazepine receptors. At high doses decreases in histamine turnover occur as a result of nitrazepam&#x27;s action at the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in mouse brain. Nitrazepam has demonstrated cortisol-suppressing properties in humans.
It is an agonist for both central benzodiazepine receptors and to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors found in rat neuroblastoma cells.

==EEG and sleep==
In sleep laboratory studies, nitrazepam decreased sleep onset latency. In psychogeriatric inpatients, it was found to be no more effective than placebo tablets in increasing total time spent asleep and to significantly impair trial subjects&#x27; abilities to move and carry out everyday activities the next day, and it should not be used as a sleep aid in psychogeriatric inpatients.

The drug causes a delay in the onset, and decrease in the duration of REM sleep. Following discontinuation of the drug, REM sleep rebound has been reported in some studies. Nitrazepam is reported to significantly affect stages of sleep - a decrease in stage 1, 3, and 4 sleep and an increase in stage 2. In young volunteers, the pharmacological properties of nitrazepam were found to produce sedation and impaired psychomotor performance and standing steadiness. EEG tests showed decreased alpha activity and increased the beta activity, according to blood plasma levels of nitrazepam. Performance was significantly impaired 13 hours after dosing with nitrazepam, as were decision-making skills. EEG tests show more drowsiness and light sleep 18 hours after nitrazepam intake, more so than amylobarbitone. Fast activity was recorded via EEG 18 hours after nitrazepam dosing. An animal study demonstrated that nitrazepam induces a drowsy pattern of spontaneous EEG including high-voltage slow waves and spindle bursts increase in the cortex and amygdala, while the hippocampal theta rhythm is desynchronized. Also low-voltage fast waves occur particularly in the cortical EEG. The EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and to electric stimulation of the mesencephalic reticular formation, posterior hypothalamus and centromedian thalamus is significantly suppressed. The photic driving response elicited by a flash light in the visual cortex is also suppressed by nitrazepam. Estazolam was found to be more potent however. Nitrazepam increases the slow wave light sleep (SWLS) in a dose-dependent manner whilst suppressing deep sleep stages. Less time is spent in stages 3 and 4 which are the deep sleep stages, when benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are used. The suppression of deep sleep stages by benzodiazepines may be especially problematic to the elderly as they naturally spend less time in the deep sleep stage.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Nitrazepam is largely bound to plasma proteins. Benzodiazepines such as nitrazepam are lipid-soluble and have a high cerebral uptake. The time for nitrazepam to reach peak plasma concentrations following oral administration is about 2 hours (0.5 to 5 hours). The half-life of nitrazepam is between 16.5 and 48.3 hours. In young people, nitrazepam has a half-life of about 29 hours and a much longer half-life of 40 hours in the elderly. Both low dose (5 mg) and high dose (10 mg) of nitrazepam significantly increases growth hormone levels in humans.

Nitrazepam&#x27;s half-life in the cerebrospinal fluid, 68 hours, indicates that nitrazepam is eliminated extremely slowly from the cerebrospinal fluid. Concomitant food intake has no influence on the rate of absorption of nitrazepam nor on its bioavailability. Therefore, nitrazepam can be taken with or without food.

==Overdose==
Nitrazepam overdose may result in stereotypical symptoms of benzodiazepine overdose including intoxication, impaired balance and slurred speech. In cases of severe overdose this may progress to a comatose state with the possibility of death. The risk of nitrazepam overdose is increased significantly if nitrazepam is abused in conjunction with opioids, as was highlighted in a review of deaths of users of the opioid buprenorphine. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam can result in a severe neurological effects. Nitrazepam taken in overdose is associated with a high level of congenital abnormalities (30 percent of births). Most of the congentital abnormalities were mild deformities.

Severe nitrazepam overdose resulting in coma causes the central somatosensory conduction time (CCT) after median nerve stimulation to be prolonged and the N20 to be dispersed. Brain-stem auditory evoked potentials demonstrate delayed interpeak latencies (IPLs) I-III, III-V and I-V. Toxic overdoses therefore of nitrazepam cause prolonged CCT and IPLs. An alpha pattern coma can be a feature of nitrazepam overdose with alpha patterns being most prominent in the frontal and central regions of the brain.

Benzodiazepines were implicated in 39% of suicides by drug poisoning in Sweden, with nitrazepam and flunitrazepam accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, in the elderly over a period of 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular nitrazepam and flunitrazepam should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a brain sample of a fatal nitrazepam poisoning high concentrations of nitrazepam and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person.

In a retrospective study of deaths in Sweden, when benzodiazepines were implicated in the deaths, the benzodiazepines nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were the most common benzodiazepines involved. Benzodiazepines were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction in this study of causes of deaths. In Sweden, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death. In Australia, nitrazepam and temazepam were the benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose drug related deaths. In a third of cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death.

Individuals with chronic illnesses are much more vulnerable to lethal overdose with nitrazepam, as fatal overdoses can occur at relatively low doses in these individuals.

==Synthesis==
Reaction of 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone (1) with bromoacetyl bromide forms the amide 2. Ring closure in liquid ammonia affords nitrazepam (3). More simply, diazepinone (4) can be nitrated directly at the more reactive C7 position with potassium nitrate in sulfuric acid.

<text>Eleazer Derby Wood (December 1783 – September 17, 1814) was a Colonel and American Army officer in the War of 1812. Fort Wood, which became the base of the Statue of Liberty, was named in his honor.

==Early career==

Wood was born in Lunenburg, Massachusetts. He was admitted to United States Military Academy at West Point on May 17, 1805 and graduated on October 30, 1806.

After graduation he served as assistant Engineer in the construction of the defenses at Governor&#x27;s Island in New York harbor, 1807. In February 1808 he was promoted to First Lieutenant. He assisted in the construction of Castle Williams in New York Harbor and Fort Norfolk in Virginia.

==War of 1812==
Shortly after the start of the War of 1812, Wood was promoted to captain on July 1, 1812.

He conducted the defence of Fort Meigs during its siege, was engaged in the sortie of May 5, 1813, for which he received a brevet (honorary promotion) to major. He was in command of the artillery at the battle of the Thames on October 5 of the same year. He was appointed acting adjutant-general to General William Henry Harrison in October 1813 and was transferred to the northern army in 1814.

Wood was engaged in all the battles of that northern campaign, including the capture of Fort Erie on July 3. Wood was also in the battles of Chippawa and Niagara Falls, and was brevetted Lieutenant Colonel for bravery at the last-named action.

After the battle of Niagara, the American army fell back to Fort Erie where Colonel Wood, then in command of the 21st Infantry Regiment, participated in the defense the fort on August 15, 1814. Colonel Wood died of wounds he received while leading a sortie from Fort Erie on September 17, 1814.

Colonel Wood&#x27;s burial location is unknown. While there is a monument to him in the West Point Cemetery, there is no evidence he is buried there.

==Legacy==
Wood was greatly admired by Major General Jacob Brown, who was Wood&#x27;s commander at the time of his death and later the commanding general of the U.S. Army. Brown commissioned a monument in Wood&#x27;s honor at West Point. Brown also had Fort Wood on Bedloe&#x27;s Island in New York Harbor, on which the Statue of Liberty was later built, named after Wood. He is also the namesake of Wood County, Ohio.

Wood&#x27;s Monument at West Point was originally located near the parade field but was moved to the post cemetery in 1885.

Wood was one of the first graduates of West Point to be killed in action. (The first was Ensign George Ronan, who was killed near Fort Dearborn in Chicago, Illinois on August 15, 1812.)

<doc id="1102367" wikidata="Q5326799" url="?curid=1102367" title="Early decision">
<text>Early decision (ED) or early acceptance is a type of early admission used in college admissions in the United States for admitting freshmen to undergraduate programs. It is used to indicate to the university or college that the candidate considers that institution to be their top choice through a binding commitment to enroll; in other words, if offered admission under an ED program, and the financial aid offered by the school is acceptable, the candidate must enroll at that institution and withdraw all applications to other institutions. Applying early decision brings a greater statistical chance of being accepted.

Candidates applying early decision typically submit their applications mid-October to early November of their senior year of high school and receive a decision around mid-December. In contrast, students applying regular decision typically must submit their applications by January 1 and receive their admissions decision by April 1. Students can know sooner where they will attend, removing uncertainty and the need for multiple applications and the associated costs. 

Typically, a candidate who has applied early decision can receive one of three outcomes in December. They may be admitted (bound to attend the school which admitted them), rejected (they will not be able to attend the school), or deferred (they will be reconsidered for admission with the second round of early decision applications or with the regular decision pool and notified later with their final decision). Generally, when an applicant is deferred, they are released from their binding commitment.

== Alternatives ==
One alternative to early decision is early action (EA). Some institutions offer both early decision or early action, while others only offer one. Early action is non-binding, so a student admitted to a school early action could choose not to enroll in that school. Furthermore, ED programs require applicants to file only one ED application, while, depending on the institution, EA programs may be restrictive or non-restrictive and allow candidates to apply to more than one institution. 

Many colleges now offer a second early decision plan: early decision II (ED II). The application typically due in late December to early January and decision in mid-February. Although the application deadline of early January is the same as for regular decision, the early decision II application is a binding commitment, with the benefits and drawbacks to the applicant and the college being similar to early decision I in most respects. The early decision II timeline is designed to allow students to apply to a new &quot;first choice&quot; school after they find out in mid- to late December they have been unsuccessful in their early decision or early action application to their original first choice, or to allow students that did not apply early decision I to apply under an early decision plan. It is intended as another chance for applicants to show commitment, and another tool for the school to protect its admission yield.

== History ==

It was in answer to criticisms of early decision that, starting in 2004, Yale and Stanford switched from early decision to single-choice early action. Harvard, Princeton, and the University of Virginia announced in the Fall of 2006 that they would no longer offer early action or early decision programs, which they claim favor the affluent, and moved to a single deadline instead. The University of Florida followed suit the following year. However, the University of Virginia, followed by both Harvard and Princeton, reinstated their single-choice early action program to promote diversity and provide opportunities for students looking for such an option in 2011.

== Binding commitment ==
Early decision is a binding decision, meaning that students must withdraw applications to other schools if accepted. It is not legally binding, but there is a commitment involved with penalties for withdrawing for spurious reasons. Advisers suggest that this method is only for students who are absolutely certain about wanting to attend a specific school. If financial aid is a concern or if a family is &quot;shopping for the best deal&quot;, then it is usually advised to apply early action or regular decision instead. The one stipulated situation under which a student may back out of the agreement is if the financial aid offer is insufficient. 

A student who backs out for other reasons may be &quot;blacklisted&quot; by the early decision college, which may contact the student&#x27;s high school guidance office, and prevent it from sending transcripts to other colleges, and high schools generally comply with such requests. In addition, the jilted college may contact other colleges about the withdrawal, and the other colleges would likely revoke their offers of acceptance as well. 

Critics of the program argue that binding an applicant, especially one that is typically seventeen or eighteen years old, to a single institution is unnecessarily restrictive. 

== Impact on financial aid ==
When admitted as an early decision applicant, with no other acceptances in hand, a student&#x27;s bargaining position is weaker because the student cannot compare offers from different colleges. Since the applicant is declaring an intention to attend if accepted, the school can &quot;pinpoint the smallest amount of financial aid it will take for the student to attend.&quot; The applicant who is sensitive to financial aid may suffer from the likelihood of the aid amount being less than the expected amount. Several reports confirm that early decision applicants tend to come from wealthier families. 

A contrasting view is that by applying earlier in the year, the accepted ED students have &quot;first crack at the money,&quot; particularly at competitive schools without large endowments. In any case, if a highly desirable ED admittee may withdraw because of financial concerns, the college &quot;may pull out all the stops&quot; to prevent this, and that the possibility of backing out for financial reasons gives an applicant some form of negotiating leverage. Universities with very large endowments may be unique in their ability to provide aid equally generously to students regardless of their application plan.

== Benefits for colleges ==
Schools which offer early decision benefit from a near certainty that the applicant will attend if admitted. As a result, the admission yield is increased by admitting more students at the ED stage. The timing of the ED process also helps admissions offices spread the work of sifting through applications throughout more of the school year. A number of schools which had EA plans have recently added ED plans to EA (Chicago and Tulane from Class of 2021 on, Virginia from Class of 2024), or have switched to ED and jettisoned EA (Boston College from Class of 2024 on).

Some college counselors speculate that ED can serve to mitigate the problem of students failing to matriculate to a particular school in favor of a &quot;superior&quot; one. For example, one college might only admit a candidate deemed qualified for another, &#x27;superior&#x27; college under ED, for in regular decision, should that student be admitted to the &#x27;superior&#x27; competitor, that student would be unlikely to attend the college that originally offered the ED admission.

== Admit rates and enrollment statistics ==
Applying early decision brings a greater statistical chance of being accepted, possibly doubling or tripling the chances of an acceptance letter. This is usually attributed to three factors: first, candidates who apply &quot;early&quot; can only present colleges with their transcripts until the end of junior year of high school and therefore must be particularly strong applicants with very persuasive transcripts; second, candidates who apply &quot;early&quot; have dedicated themselves to an institution and are more likely to match the institution&#x27;s admission standards; third, student athletes sometimes apply &quot;early&quot; to their top choice school to demonstrate their commitment to a college varsity coach who, in turn, can push their applications in the admissions process. Some advisors suggest that early decision is the best choice for students who have clearly settled on one particular college.

In 2009, the average early acceptance rate according to one estimate was 15% greater than regular decision applicants. There is less agreement, however, whether it will help a borderline student win acceptance to a competitive college. Early decision candidates tend to have stronger educational credentials than regular decision candidates, and as a result, these candidates would have been admitted whether they applied by early or regular methods, and therefore the greater statistical likelihood of acceptance may have been explained by membership in the stronger applicant pool. But the commitment of an early decision application demonstrated by a borderline student can still be beneficial; &quot;colleges really want qualified students who want them&quot; and are more likely to offer acceptances to students ready to make a full commitment.

Most institutions include data on the number of ED applicants and ED admits in their annual Common Data Set (a few institutions do not release a Common Data Set at all), and trends for an individual institution can be readily complied. At the most competitive schools, the number of ED applicants has increased at a more rapid pace than regular decision applicants. Although the ED admit rate has declined at these schools in recent years, the &quot;absolute&quot; number of ED admits has managed to &quot;increase&quot; while the absolute number of regular decision admits has fallen rapidly and all the admit rates have also fallen.

A few schools have seen ED applicants more than double in the 2012–2019 period, including Rice (2,628 ED apps in 2019–20 compared to 1,230 ED apps in 2012–13), Emory, NYU (13,842 ED I and ED II apps in 2019–20; 5,778 in 2012–13), and Boston University (4,700 ED I and ED II apps in 2019–20; 1,069 in 2012–13). The number of ED admits has also doubled at NYU and Boston University over this period, and although the increase of ED admits at other schools has been less dramatic, that increase has nonetheless reduced the number of RD admits meaningfully because half the class or more is now being filled by ED admits. At WashU and NYU, about 60% of the class is now taken up at the ED stage.

In recent years, there has been a marked trend in the number of ED applicants, and in the proportion of the class being admitted via the ED process. As of 2019–20, almost every highly selective college (where admission rates are below 25%) admits more students through ED than it did a decade ago, but among them, there has been a remarkable shift in the admission strategy of a few schools resulting in as much as 60% of the class being selected from the ED pool compared to 30–35% only a few years ago.

A similar trend exists across the most competitive liberal arts colleges in early decision application and admission numbers, with over 50% of the class being filled at these schools from ED admits compared to only about 44% in 2012–13. Notably, the absolute number of ED admits has increased, even though the number of RD admits, the RD admit rate, the ED admit rate and the overall admit rate have all gone down.

<doc id="1102368" wikidata="Q2002829" url="?curid=1102368" title="R rotunda">
<text>The r rotunda ⟨ ꝛ ⟩, &quot;rounded r&quot;, is a historical calligraphic variant of the minuscule (lowercase) letter Latin &quot;r&quot; used in full script-like typefaces, especially blackletters.

Unlike other letter variants such as &quot;long s&quot; which originally were orthographically distinctive, &quot;r rotunda&quot; has always been a calligraphic variant, used when the letter followed a letter with a rounded stroke towards the right side, such as , , , (and In this way, it is comparable to numerous other special types used for ligatures or conjoined letters in early modern typesetting.

== Form ==
This symbol came in several different shapes, all of which were of x-height. 
The shape of the letter used in blackletter scripts Textualis as well as Rotunda is reminiscent of &quot;half an r&quot;, namely, the right side of the Roman capital ; it also looks similar to an Arabic numeral .

Like minuscules in general, this shape for r originated in the style of cursive writing that was common during the medieval period, which ultimately derived from scribal practice during Late Antiquity.

The &quot;r rotunda&quot; shape of cursive resembling the numeral is also found in a number of medieval scribal abbreviations containing , for example in the signs for the Latin word-final syllables 
&quot;ram&quot;, &quot;-orum&quot; and &quot;-arum&quot;.

There are several variant forms for the &quot;r rotunda&quot; glyph.

A very narrow second variant is found in some Textura manuscripts, in the form of one solid diamond atop another atop a vertical stroke.
Another form found in German typefaces is a variant of that previous, with something like part of an resembling an integral sign atop something rather like a . It can be found used as the second of a pair and after .
A fifth form, used in the 18th century in some French italic typefaces, was a derivative either of the Schrift form of the minuscule or of similar typefaces used elsewhere. Its form was of a backwards set just after the same shape rotated 180 degrees. They were separated by a space smaller than their stroke width, and the whole character was slanted as though it were cursive. As this typeface has the whose ascender curves to the left (giving it a rounded right side), it was used after that character as well. By then, though, the character was the same width as a regular , so it was maintained because it appeared to its users to have some elegance or to remind them of prestigious old calligraphy.

==Use for Tironian &quot;et&quot;==

The abbreviation etc. was typeset using the Tironian &quot;et&quot; , as in early incunables. 
Later, when typesets no longer contained a sort for the Tironian &quot;et&quot;, it became common practice to use the &quot;r rotunda&quot; glyph instead, setting for &quot;etc.&quot;

== Demise ==
Use of this form of r was never widespread except in blackletter scripts, so it fell out of use in English in the 16th century as roman scripts became predominant. Some modern cursive scripts use a letter that has a resemblance to the r rotunda.

==Encoding==
In Unicode, the character is encoded as and 

The letter was added to Unicode in 2005, in the Latin Extended-D block. It is included in Unicode 5.1 in both lower case and upper case forms, although there seems to be no real evidence for the historical existence of a capital version and a normal capital &quot;R&quot; seems to have been used instead.

Before that, the Medieval Unicode Font Initiative (MUFI) had allocated it in the Private Use Area (PUA) of medievalist fonts at U+F20E and U+F22D. Since the characters are now available in Unicode, MUFI recommends that the Unicode code points be used, not the PUA code points.

Some fonts treat the glyph as a mere stylistic variant of and may make it available by smart font features, e.g. Open Type &#x27;hist&#x27;, &#x27;hlig&#x27;, &#x27;calt&#x27;, &#x27;salt&#x27; or &#x27;ss**&#x27;.

Latin Extended-D also has characters for medieval scribal abbreviations. Among them is the abbreviation for the syllable &quot;rum&quot;, consisting of a &quot;r rotunda&quot; with a cut, resulting in a shape very similar to the astrological symbol for Jupiter . These symbols are encoded as and .

<text>Tilghman Mayfield Tucker (February 5, 1802 – April 3, 1859) was Governor of Mississippi from 1842 to 1844. He was a Democrat.

==Early life==
Tucker was born in North Carolina near Lime Stone Springs, and lived in Alabama for a time before moving to Mississippi. He left his career of blacksmithing in Wise Gap, Mississippi and studied law under Judge Daniel W. Wright in Hamilton, Mississippi. office in Columbus, Mississippi.

==Career==
Tucker was elected in 1831 to the Mississippi House of Representatives as a Democrat and was the first representative from Lowndes County, serving until 1835. From 1838 to 1841 he served in the state senate.

In 1837 he had 3 male slaves and 4 female slaves according to the state census.

By 1841, the aftermath of the Panic of 1837 had caused a division among Mississippi Democrats. The issue was whether the state would honor the bonds of the Planters Bank and Union Bank, both of which had failed in the panic. Some Democrats stated that they would support the Whig gubernatorial candidate David Shattuck who wanted the redemption of the bonds in the 1841 Mississippi gubernatorial election. Though Tucker was at first reluctant to accept the Democratic nomination in the election, he accepted and won with a narrow victory.

During Tucker&#x27;s two-year term (1842–1844), the Democratic Party remained divided over the bond issue. Also, Tucker&#x27;s political opponents accused him of not acting fast enough in matter of state treasurer Richard S. Graves, who had embezzled $44,000 of state funding and fled to Canada.

Tucker was not nominated for reelection in the 1843 Mississippi gubernatorial election, but he did win one term in the U.S. House of Representatives from March 4, 1843, to March 3, 1845. He then retired from public life and moved to his Louisiana plantation home named Cottonwood. While visiting his father near Bexar in Marion County, Alabama, Tucker died on April 3, 1859.

<doc id="1102384" wikidata="Q880583" url="?curid=1102384" title="Albert G. Brown">
<text>Albert Gallatin Brown (May 31, 1813June 12, 1880) was Governor of Mississippi from 1844 to 1848 and a Democratic United States Senator from Mississippi from 1854 to 1861, when he withdrew during secession.

==Early life==
He was born to Joseph and Elizabeth (Rice) Brown, a poor family of hog farmers, in the Chester District of South Carolina, at the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains in 1813. The family were farmers originally from Charlotte County, Virginia, from where Brown&#x27;s grandfather had moved to South Carolina in the 1770s. The family can be tracked to Lincolnshire, England from where the first Brown ancestor arrived in Virginia in 1697, and moved to Charlotte County in the 1720s In 1823, when he was only 10 years old his family moved to the new state of Mississippi. The Brown family settled Copiah County, south of the state capital, Jackson. Raising cotton in the new frontier state proved to be lucrative for the Brown family. In 1824, just one year after settling in Mississippi, Joseph Brown was elected Justice of the Peace in Copiah County. By 1825, two years after arriving in Mississippi, he was the third-largest taxpayer in the county, owning 18 slaves. By 1832, he was farming a plantation of 1,600 acres and owned 23 slaves.

In 1829, Albert Brown entered Mississippi College, but he soon transferred to Jefferson College, which he attended for about six months.

==Political career==
During his lifetime, Brown was one of the most popular and the most influential men in Mississippi. He is considered to be the father of the public school system and of the University of Mississippi. His rhetorical attacks on illiteracy are considered to have made a substantial contribution to the cause of education in Mississippi.

He was also a Fire-Eater and a strong advocate for the expansion of slavery. In 1858, he said: &quot;I want a foothold in Central America... because I want to plant slavery there... I want Cuba... Tamaulipas, Potosi, and one or two other Mexican States; and I want them all for the same reason - for the planting or spreading of slavery.&quot; Indeed, he went on to say, &quot;I would spread the blessings of slavery, like the religion of our Divine Master, to the uttermost ends of the earth.&quot;

To those who agreed with such views, &quot;Albert Gallatin Brown possessed magical powers. With many learnt spells, handsome countenance surrounded by a luxuriant, flowing beard and dark-curly hair, in every sense he looked distinguished. Courageous, he was void of vanity; animated, he was persuasive; his spirit, crackerish to the extreme.&quot; In his speech, Reuben Davis, who knew him well, states in his book &quot;Reminiscences on Mississippi and Mississippians&quot; that Brown &quot;was the best-balanced man I ever knew... In politics, he had strategy with-out corruption, and handled all his opponents with skill but never descended to intrigue.&quot; During a lifetime, most of which was spent in an epoch of bitter controversy, his most intimate friends never heard him speak ill of others.

Brown served three terms in the state legislature, four in the US Congress, one on the circuit bench. He was twice elected United States senator, twice Governor, and once senator in the Confederate Congress. Rand wrote that &quot;the political career of Albert Gallatin Brown provides one of the most amazing chapters in Mississippi history.&quot;

==Personal life==
Brown&#x27;s first wife was Elizabeth Frances Thornton Taliaferro (1817–1836) of Virginia, who died about five months after the marriage. She was the daughter of Richard Henry Taliaferro, Sr. (1783–1830) and Frances Walker Gilmer (ca. 1784-1826).

Brown&#x27;s second wife was Roberta Eugenia Young (1813–1886), daughter of Brig. Gen. Robert Young (1768–1824) and Elizabeth Mary Conrad (1772–1810). Roberta&#x27;s older sister was Elizabeth Mary Young (1804–1859), the wife of Philip Richard Fendall II (1794–1867), the District Attorney of the District of Columbia.

==Death==
Overcome by a stroke of apoplexy, Brown fell face down in a shallow pond at his home near Terry in 1880. His last remains rest in Greenwood Cemetery, Jackson.

==Legacy==
Brown was a slaveholder.
In &quot;Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl&quot;, a narrative written by the escaped slave Harriet Jacobs, Brown is called out by Jacobs for supporting slavery in a speech to Congress despite the fact that he &quot;could not be ignorant of [the wrongdoings perpetrated against slaves], for they are of frequent occurrence in every Southern State.&quot;

Brown County, Kansas, is named after him.

==In popular culture==
In the 1992 alternate history/science fiction novel &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; by Harry Turtledove, Brown is an important supporting character.

<doc id="1102391" wikidata="Q1374215" url="?curid=1102391" title="Rex Allen">
<text>Rex Elvie Allen Sr. (December 31, 1920 – December 17, 1999), known as &quot;the Arizona Cowboy&quot;, was an American film and television actor, singer and songwriter; he was also the narrator of many Disney nature and Western productions. For his contributions to the film industry, Allen received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1975, located at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Early life==
Allen was born to Horace E. Allen and Luella Faye Clark on a ranch in Mud Springs Canyon, forty miles from Willcox in Cochise County in southeastern Arizona, United States. As a boy he played guitar and sang at local functions with his fiddle-playing father, until high-school graduation when he toured the Southwest as a rodeo rider. He got his start in show business on the East Coast.

==Early career==

Allen began his singing career on radio station KOY in Phoenix, Arizona, after which he became better known as a performer on the &quot;National Barn Dance&quot; on WLS in Chicago.

When singing cowboys such as Roy Rogers and Gene Autry were very much in vogue in American film, in 1949 Republic Pictures in Hollywood gave him a screen test and put him under contract. Beginning in 1950, Allen starred as himself in 19 of Hollywood&#x27;s Western movies. One of the top-ten box office draws of the day, whose character was soon depicted in comic books, on screen Allen personified the clean cut, God-fearing American hero of the Wild West, who wore a white Stetson hat, loved his faithful horse Koko, and had a loyal buddy who shared his adventures. Allen&#x27;s comic-relief sidekick in his first few pictures was first Buddy Ebsen and then character actor Slim Pickens.

==Personal life==
In 1940, Allen married Doris Windsor, with whom he had one child (Rexine Allen). His second marriage was to Bonnie Linder (m. 1946–1973), with whom he had four children. His third and final marriage was to Virginia Hudson, on November 25, 1992. The couple divorced in 1999.

His five children included Rex Allen Jr., who became a singer like his father.

==Later career==
Allen wrote and recorded many songs, a number of which were featured in his own films. Late in coming to the industry, his film career was relatively short as the popularity of series westerns faded by the mid 1950s. But he starred in a number of B-Westerns during the 1950s.

As other cowboy stars made the transition to television, Allen tried too, cast as Dr. Bill Baxter for the half-hour weekly syndicated series &quot;Frontier Doctor&quot;. In 1961, he was one of five rotating hosts for NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Five Star Jubilee&quot;.

Allen had a rich, pleasant voice, ideally suited for narration, and was able to find considerable work as a narrator in a variety of films, especially for Walt Disney Pictures wildlife films and television shows. The work earned him the nickname, &quot;The Voice of the West.&quot; He narrated &quot;The Legend of Lobo&quot;, &quot;The Incredible Journey&quot;, &quot;Yellowstone Cubs&quot;, &quot;Run, Appaloosa, Run&quot;, and Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar. He also was the voice of the father on Walt Disney&#x27;s Carousel of Progress, first presented at the 1964 World&#x27;s Fair and now at Walt Disney World. A 1993 renovation replaced Allen with Jean Shepherd as the voice of the father, but Allen was given a cameo as the grandfather in the final scene.

Allen provided the narration for the 1973 Hanna-Barbera animated film &quot;Charlotte&#x27;s Web&quot;. He was also the voice behind Purina Dog Chow commercials for many years. After moving to Sonoita, Arizona, in the early 1990s, he was a viable voice talent almost until his death, recording hundreds of national advertising voice tracks at his favorite Tucson studio, Porter Sound. In his later years he also performed frequently with actor Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez. He wrote and sang the theme song for the early 1980s sitcom &quot;Best of the West&quot;.

==Death==
Allen died on December 17, 1999, in Tucson, Arizona. He had collapsed in his driveway after suffering a heart attack and was then accidentally run over by his caregiver. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at Railroad Park in Willcox.

==Legacy==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Allen was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6821 Hollywood Boulevard.

In 1983, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

In 1989, his life story was told in the book &quot;Rex Allen: My Life, Sunrise to Sunset – The Arizona Cowboy&quot;, written by Paula Simpson-Witt and Snuff Garrett.

The Rex Allen Arizona Cowboy Museum and Willcox Cowboy Hall of Fame in Willcox features an Allen&#x27;s collection of memorabilia, including photos, movie posters, cowboy outfits, records and musical instruments. His cremated ashes were scattered in Railroad Park, across the street from the museum, near a bronze statue of Allen.

Allen was a cousin of the &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; cast member Glenn Strange, who played bartender Sam Noonan.

<text>The Sinaia Monastery, located in Sinaia, in Prahova County, Romania, was founded by Prince Mihail Cantacuzino in 1695 and named after the great Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery on Mount Sinai in Egypt. As of 2005, it is inhabited by 13 Christian Orthodox monks led by hegumen Macarie Boguș. It is part of the Bucharest archdiocese.

==Overview==

Situated in the Prahova Valley, the monastery gave its name to the nearby town of Sinaia. The monastery consists of two courtyards surrounded by low buildings. In the centre of each courtyard there is a small church built in the Byzantine style. One of them—&quot;Biserica Veche&quot; (The Old Church)—dates from 1695, while the more recent &quot;Biserica Mare&quot; (The Great Church) was built in 1846.

The monks possess a library that is a repository for valuable jewels belonging to the Cantacuzino family, as well as the earliest Romanian translation of the Bible, dated 1668.

Take Ionescu, former Prime Minister of Romania, is buried on the grounds.

==History==
Prince (Spătarul) Mihail Cantacuzino founded the monastery upon his return from a pilgrimage to Mount Sinai. The first buildings were completed between 1690 and 1695. It was designed to serve as a monastery as well as a fortified stronghold on the route from Brasov to Bucharest.

The initial plan was for the monastery to hold 12 monks, to imitate the Twelve Apostles, but in time the number of monks grew.

In the midst of the Russo-Turkish War, 1735–1739, before deserting the monastery, monks hid the valuables by burying them inside a bell. During a battle, the Turks defeated troops stationed within the walls of the monastery. The Ottomans burned the area and broke through the wall in two places.

Until 1850, Sinaia consisted of little more than the monastery and a group of huts. In 1864, however, the monastic estate was assigned to the Board of Civil Hospitals (&quot;Eforia Spitalelor Civile&quot;), which opened a hospital and several baths, and helped develop mineral springs in Sinaia.

In 1948, the monastery was put under the patronage of the Archdiocese of Bucharest from the Board of Civil Hospitals. The Romanian Patriarch, Justinian Marina, restored the buildings between the years 1951 and 1957 with money from the Archdiocese. During this period, the whole monastery was fitted with running water, electricity, and natural gas. Thanks to the efforts of King Carol I, the Great Church of the monastery became the first church to use electric lights in Romania.

==The Old Church==

The Old Church was built in 1695. In 2006, it was closed to begin a restoration project to return it to its former beauty. The original interior painting was completed by Pârvu Mutu and were restored for the first time in 1795. The Old Church has reopened as of 2016.

==The Great Church==
Under the leadership of Hegumens Ioasaf and Paisie, construction of The Great Church began in 1842 using funds allocated by the monastery and was completed in 1846. This smaller structure was enlarged by the Board of Civil Hospitals during a period from 1897 to 1903. These efforts gave the building the appearance it has today.

===Current appearance===
Created by architect George Mandrea, the structure utilizes the Moldavian style and the Brâncovenesc style from Walachia. It is said that the belt of three green enamel lines that encircle the building represent the unity of the Holy Trinity in one God and the unity of the Three Romanian Kingdoms in one country.

===Paintings===
The gold mosaic paintings were created by Danish artist Aage Exner in a typical neo-Byzantine style. The main illustrations show five persons:
* Iosif Gheorghian &quot;mitropolit primat&quot; – he re-opened the building in 1903
* Carol I of Romania – shown dressed as an officer, with his right hand upon a rock pillar with a missing piece. This symbolizes the missing Romanian territories at that time
* Elisabeth of Wied – Queen consort of Romania, known in the literary world as Carmen Sylva
* Princess Maria of Romania – Queen Elisabeta&#x27;s only child, who died at an early age
* Mihail Cantacuzino – builder of the Old Church

===Furniture===
The furniture was made of wood (sycamore, maple, and oak) by Constantin Babic and his students at the Bucharest Art School (&quot;Ṣcoala de Arte si Meserii&quot;). The King&#x27;s throne displays the royal emblem and the motto &quot;Nihil sine Deo&quot; (Nothing without God). The Queen&#x27;s throne is embossed with the letters E.D. Both thrones are gold-plated.

The two Russian icons, of Saint Serghei and Saint Nicholas, were a gift from Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1903. They were presented to the Hegumen Nifon Arhimandritul for the baptism of Prince Nicholae, son of King Ferdinand.

A remarkable piece adorning the monastery is the epitaphios by Anna Roth, made of silk and gold on a cotton base. It took three years (from 1897 to 1900) to finish.

==The bell tower==

During the leadership of Hegumen Nifon Popescu (1888–1909), a large bell tower was added to the monastery walls. It was completed in 1892. The bell was brought from the Colţea Tower in Bucharest.

==The museum==
In 1895 the museum of the monastery was opened, the first exhibition of religious objects in Romania. It holds collections of icons and crosses from the 17th century, the very first Bible in Romanian (Bucharest, 1688), and many other precious objects. 
The museum is open every day but Mondays, from April to October 10:00-16:00 and during winter time only for groups over 20. Fee: 5 lei (2 lei for students).

==Location==
The monastery is nearby Peleş Castle and it can be reached by train as Sinaia railway station is just &#x27;downstairs&#x27; from the monastery. It is also accessible by road.

<text>Wojciech Hubert Zurek (; born 1951) is a Polish and American theoretical physicist and a leading authority on quantum theory, especially decoherence and non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry breaking and resulting defect generation (known as the Kibble–Zurek mechanism).

==Education==
He attended the I Liceum Ogólnokształcące im. Mikołaja Kopernika (1st Secondary High School of Mikołaj Kopernik) in Bielsko-Biała.

Zurek earned his M.Sc. in physics at AGH University of Science and Technology, Kraków, Poland in 1974 and completed his Ph.D. under advisor William C. Schieve at the University of Texas at Austin in 1979. He spent two years at Caltech as a Tolman Fellow, and started at LANL as a J. Oppenheimer Fellow.

==Career==
He was the leader of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at Los Alamos from 1991 until he was made a laboratory fellow in the theory division in 1996. Zurek is currently a foreign associate of the &quot;Cosmology&quot;&quot; Program&quot; at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. He served as a member of the external faculty of the Santa Fe Institute, and has been a visiting professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Zurek co-organized the programs &quot;Quantum Coherence and Decoherence&quot; and &quot;Quantum Computing and Chaos&quot; at UCSB&#x27;s Institute for Theoretical Physics.

He researches decoherence, physics of quantum and classical information, non-equilibrium dynamics of defect generation, and astrophysics. He is also the co-author, along with William Wootters and Dennis Dieks, of a proof stating that a single quantum cannot be cloned (see the no-cloning theorem). He also coined the terms einselection and quantum discord.

Zurek with his colleague Tom W. B. Kibble pioneered a paradigmatic framework for understanding defect generation in non-equilibrium processes, particularly, for understanding topological defects generated when a second-order phase transition point is crossed at a finite rate. The paradigm covers phenomena of enormous varieties and scales, ranging from structure formation in the early Universe to vortex generation in superfluids. The key mechanism of critical defect generation is known as the Kibble–Zurek mechanism, and the resulting scaling laws known as the &quot;Kibble–Zurek scaling laws&quot;.

He pointed out the fundamental role of environment in determining a set of special basis states immune to environmental decoherence (pointer basis) which defines a classical measuring apparatus unambiguously. His work on decoherence paves a way towards the understanding of emergence of the classical world from the quantum mechanical one, getting rid of ad hoc demarcations between the two, like the one imposed by Niels Bohr in the famous Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. The underlying mechanism proposed and developed by Zurek and his collaborators is known as quantum Darwinism. His work also has a lot of potential benefit to the emerging field of quantum computing.

He is a pioneer in information physics, edited an influential book on &quot;Complexity, Entropy and the Physics of Information&quot;, and spearheaded the efforts that finally exorcised Maxwell&#x27;s demon. Zurek showed that the demon can extract energy from its environment for &quot;free&quot; as long as it (a) is able to find structure in the environment, and (b) is able to compress this pattern (whereas the remaining code is more succinct than the brute-force description of the structure). In this way the demon can exploit thermal fluctuations. However, he showed that in thermodynamic equilibrium (the most likely state of the environment), the demon can at best break even, even if the information about the environment is compressed. As a result of his exploration, Zurek suggested redefining entropy and distinguishing between two parts: the part that we already know about the environment (measured in Kolmogorov complexity), and, conditioned on our knowledge, the remaining uncertainty (measured in Shannon entropy).

He is a staff scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory and also a laboratory fellow (a prestigious distinction for a US National Laboratory scientist). Zurek was awarded the Albert Einstein Professorship Prize by the Foundation of the University of Ulm in Germany in 2010.

<text>Vincristine, also known as leurocristine and marketed under the brand name Oncovin among others, is a chemotherapy medication used to treat a number of types of cancer. This includes acute lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, neuroblastoma, and small cell lung cancer among others. It is given intravenously.
Most people experience some side effects from vincristine treatment. Commonly it causes a change in sensation, hair loss, constipation, difficulty walking, and headaches. Serious side effects may include neuropathic pain, lung damage, or low white blood cells which increases the risk of infection. Use during pregnancy may result in birth defects. It works by stopping cells from dividing properly. It is vital that it not be given intrathecally, as this may kill.
Vincristine was first isolated in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is a vinca alkaloid that can be obtained from the Madagascar periwinkle &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot;.

==Medical uses==
Vincristine is delivered via intravenous infusion for use in various types of chemotherapy regimens. Its main uses are in non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma as part of the chemotherapy regimen CHOP R-CVP, Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma as part of MOPP, COPP, BEACOPP, or the less popular Stanford V chemotherapy regimen in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and in treatment for nephroblastoma as well as the chemotherapy regimen VDC-IE for Ewing&#x27;s Sarcoma. It is also used to induce remission in ALL with dexamethasone and L-asparaginase, and in combination with prednisone to treat childhood leukemia. Vincristine is occasionally used as an immunosuppressant, for example, in treating thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).

==Side effects==
The main side effects of vincristine are chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, hyponatremia, constipation, and hair loss.

Vincristine-induced neuropathy is the main dose-limiting side effect. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy can be severe, and may be a reason to reduce or avoid using vincristine. The symptoms are progressive and enduring tingling numbness, pain and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes affecting the arms and legs. One of the first symptoms of peripheral neuropathy is foot drop: A person with a family history of foot drop and/or Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) should avoid vincristine. A 2021 study has suggested that anakinra can reduce the neuropathy.

Accidental injection of vinca alkaloids into the spinal canal (intrathecal administration) is highly dangerous, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent. The medical literature documents cases of ascending paralysis due to massive encephalopathy and spinal nerve demyelination, accompanied by intractable pain, almost uniformly leading to death. Several patients have survived after aggressive and immediate intervention. Rescue treatments consist of washout of the cerebrospinal fluid and administration of protective medications. Children may do better following this injury. One child, who was aggressively treated at the time of the injection, recovered almost completely with only mild neurological deficits. A significant series of inadvertent intrathecal vincristine administration occurred in China in 2007 when batches of cytarabine and methotrexate (both often used intrathecally) manufactured by the company Shanghai Hualian were found to be contaminated with vincristine.

The overuse of vincristine may also lead to drug resistance by overexpression of the p-glycoprotein pump (Pgp). There is an attempt to overcome resistance by the addition of derivatives and substituents to the vincristine molecule.

==Mechanism of action==
Vincristine works partly by binding to the tubulin protein, stopping the tubulin dimers from polymerizing to form microtubules, causing the cell to be unable to separate its chromosomes during the metaphase. The cell then undergoes apoptosis. The vincristine molecule inhibits leukocyte production and maturation. A downside, however, to vincristine is that it does not only affect the division of cancer cells. It affects all rapidly dividing cell types, making it necessary for the very specific administration of the drug.

==Chemistry==
The natural extraction of vincristine from &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; is produced at a percent yield of less than 0.0003%. For this reason, alternate methods to produce synthetic vincristine are being used. Vincristine is created through the semi-synthesis coupling of indole alkaloids vindoline and catharanthine in the vinca plant. It can also now be synthesized through a stereocontrolled total synthesis technique which retains the correct stereochemistry at C18&#x27; and C2&#x27;. The absolute stereochemistry at these carbons is responsible for vincristine&#x27;s anticancer activity.

The liposome encapsulation of vincristine enhances the efficacy of the vincristine drug while simultaneously decreasing the neurotoxicity associated with it. Liposome encapsulation increases vincristine&#x27;s plasma concentration and circulation lifetime in the body, and allows the drug to enter cells more easily.

==History==
Having been used as a folk remedy for centuries, studies in the 1950s revealed that the rosy periwinkle &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; contained over 120 alkaloids, many of which are biologically active, the two most significant being vincristine and vinblastine. Its use as an anti-tumor, anti-mutagenic agent is well documented in the ancient Ayurveda system of medicine and in the folk culture of Madagascar and Southern Africa. It was not found to be anti-diabetic in double blinded controlled studies. While initial studies for its use in diabetes mellitus were disappointing, the discovery that it caused myelosuppression (decreased activity of the bone marrow) led to its study in mice with leukemia, whose lifespan was prolonged by the use of a vinca preparation. Treatment of the ground plant with Skellysolve-B (hexane), followed by dilute tartaric acid and benzene extraction, provided an active fraction. This fraction was further chromatographed on deactivated aluminium oxide using trichloromethane and benzene, and separation by pH using extraction with various buffers to yield vincristine.

Vincristine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 1963 under the trade name Oncovin and was marketed by Eli Lilly and Company. The drug was initially developed by a team at Lilly Research Laboratories in Indianapolis where it was demonstrated that vincristine cured artificially induced leukemia in mice and remission of acute leukemias of childhood.

Production of vincristine required one ton of dried periwinkle leaves to produce one ounce of vincristine. The periwinkle was grown on a ranch in Texas.

==Society and culture==

=== Suppliers ===
Until recently, two generic drug makers were suppliers of vincristine in the United States: Teva and Pfizer. In 2019 Teva stopped producing vincristine, leaving Pfizer as the only company in production. Teva has said that they will restart production, and expect it to be available in 2020.

=== Shortage ===
In October 2019 an impending shortage was reported; no adequate substitute is known for treating childhood-cancers. By 2022, the shortage of vincristine continued.

==Controversy==

===Pharmaceutical bioprospecting===

Vincristine&#x27;s origins are debated as an example of pharmaceutical bioprospecting in the fields of ethnobotany and ethnomedicine. Some consider the &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; plant from which vincristine is derived, and its folk remedies to be endemic to Madagascar, and that Madagascar was denied royalties from vincristine sales. However, &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; has a documented history in folk medicine treatments in other locations. In 1963, Lilly researchers acknowledged that the plant was used in Brazil to treat hemorrhage, scurvy, toothaches, and chronic wounds; in the British West Indies to treat diabetic ulcers; and in the Philippines and South Africa as an oral hypoglycemic agent – but not as a treatment for cancer.

&quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; has been a cosmopolitan species since before the Industrial Revolution and the plant&#x27;s use in folk remedies suggested general bioactivity for diabetes treatment, not cancer. In the mid-eighteenth century, botanist Judith Sumner recorded the arrival of &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; at London&#x27;s Chelsea Physic Garden from the Jardin des plantes in Paris. It&#x27;s unclear how the plant first arrived in Paris and the details of its origins in Madagascar beyond reports of its transport from Madagascar by early European explorers. Vincristine was initially distributed at cost to increase accessibility, though later switched to a for-profit model to recover the costs of production and development. According to Michael Brown, vincristine may not be a tidy example of pharmaceutical bioprospecting, but it demonstrates how pharmaceuticals with a history of use in folk medicine have intellectual property claims which are difficult to untangle.

== Vincristine and confusion with other drugs in administration ==

Vincristine has been involved in a number of medical errors. Multiple instances of vincristine having been administered improperly, after having been confused with other drugs, have occurred. If delivered into the spine (intrathecal) it causes paralysis and usually death.

In 2003 two Australian oncology pharmacists recommended a solution. The suggested procedure is to prepare and administer vincristine in a small volume mini-bag rather than a syringe thus physically preventing the vincristine syringe being accidentally attached to a spinal needle. Acceptance of this safer procedure has been slow.

== Research ==

In 2012, the FDA approved a liposomal formulation of vincristine branded as Marqibo. Marqibo was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in November, 2021.

A nano-particle bound version of vincristine was under development as of 2014.

In 1995 and 2006 Malagasy agronomists and American political ecologists studied the production of &quot;Catharanthus roseus&quot; around Fort Dauphin and Ambovombe and its export as a natural source of the alkaloids used to make vincristine, vinblastine and other vinca alkaloid cancer drugs. Their research focused on the wild collection of periwinkle roots and leaves from roadsides and fields and its industrial cultivation on large farms.

<text>Mary Jayne Gold (August 12, 1909 – October 5, 1997) was an American heiress who played an important role helping European Jews and intellectuals escape from Nazi-occupied France in 1940–41, during World War II. Many had fled there in preceding years from Germany, where oppression had mounted.

==Early years and education==

Gold was born in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois to Margaret and Egbert H. Gold. Her father owned a business the Vapor Car Heating Company that manufactured radiators and heating systems. The family was very wealthy. Gold was educated at the Masters School at Dobbs Ferry, New York and a finishing school in Italy. 

In the 1930s, her monied background enabled her to enjoy the vibrant social scene in London and Paris. Piloting her own airplane, she traveled around Europe, spending her time at luxury hotels, skiing at the best resorts in the Alps, and socializing with the elite of the day. By the time war broke out in 1939, she was living in Paris.

==During World War II==
Gold was living in a Paris apartment in 1940 when France fell to the onslaught of the German army. She fled to the Mediterranean seaport of Marseille which, although not Nazi occupied, was under the control of the collaborationist Vichy regime. In Marseille she met Miriam Davenport, an American art student; and Varian Fry, an American journalist and intellectual. Acting as a representative of the Emergency Rescue Committee, formed in New York in 1940, Fry was to assist Jewish and anti-Nazi artists and intellectuals in leaving France. Marseille was the last free port in Europe. He had $3,000 and a short list of refugees, mostly Jews, under imminent threat of arrest by agents of the Gestapo. Other anti-Nazi writers, avant-garde artists, musicians and hundreds of others desperately seeking any chance to escape France came to his door. In the 1940 armistice agreement between Germany and defeated France, France had agreed to &quot;surrender on demand&quot; refugees to the Nazis.

Instead of returning to the United States, Gold chose to remain in France. She joined Fry and Davenport, along with other volunteers, in sheltering refugees and organizing their escape through the mountains to Spain and neutral Portugal, or by smuggling them aboard freighters sailing to either North Africa or ports in North or South America. She was helped in part by Raymond Couraud, a French Foreign Legionnaire who had become a local gangster after returning to France, and her lover. Gold helped subsidize the ERC operation, which is credited with participating in the rescue of some 2,000 refugees. Among the escapees were notables such as the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, artist Marc Chagall, writer Hannah Arendt, and physician and biochemist Otto Meyerhof, a Nobel Prize winner.

The Vichy government had been monitoring Fry&#x27;s activities and arrested him in the fall of 1941, forcing him to return to the United States. About then, Gold was also forced to leave France, and returned to the US. Couraud escaped through Spain and went to England, where he became a war hero flying in the Special Air Service.

==After the war==

After the war, Gold maintained an apartment in New York City but lived primarily in a house she had built in the village of Gassin, Var, not far from Saint-Tropez. In 1980, she published a memoir about her wartime experiences, &quot;Crossroads Marseilles, 1940&quot;. The memoir was published by Doubleday and translated into French in 2001 by Alice Seelow. Mary Jayne Gold&#x27;s literary estate was left to Pierre Sauvage.

Gold never married and had no children. She died of pancreatic cancer on October 5, 1997, at her villa in Gassin, France. She was interred at Pilgrim Home Cemetery in Michigan.

Her niece, Alison Leslie Gold, is a well-known author of books on the Holocaust. She is known for &quot;Anne Frank Remembered: The Story of the Woman Who Helped Hide the Frank Family&quot; (1987), which was co-written with Miep Gies.

== Representation in other media ==
* Julie Orringer&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;The Flight Portfolio&quot; (2019), explores the figures and work of the Emergency Rescue Committee, including Gold&#x27;s life and experiences in Marseilles. It integrates fictional elements with historic persons and events.
* This novel was adapted as a limited television series, &quot;Transatlantic&quot; (2023), produced and streamed by Netflix. It stars Gillian Jacobs as Gold, Cory Michael Smith as Varian Fry and Lucas Englander as Albert Hirschman. The series includes a short documentary about the making of the program, with comments by actors, producers and directors.
* Meg Waite Clayton&#x27;s historical novel, &quot;The Postmistress of Paris&quot; (2021), is a fictionalized version of Gold&#x27;s story, similar in plot (often scene-for-scene) with &quot;Transatlantic&quot;, but with &quot;Mary Jayne&quot; replaced by &quot;Nanée&quot; and some other characters also using fictionalized names.

<text>James Whitfield (December 15, 1791 – June 25, 1875) was an American politician. He served as the Governor of Mississippi from November 24, 1851, to January 10, 1852. He also served in both houses of the Mississippi Legislature.

==Background==

He served until United States Senator Henry S. Foote, who had been elected governor, could complete his service in the Senate and resign from that body. Whitfield was a Democrat. He donated of land in the northern part of the state to facilitate the creation of what is simultaneously the state&#x27;s largest psychiatric facility and hospital, now known as Mississippi State Hospital. His Columbus, Mississippi plantation was sold in 1852 to Thomas Carleton Billups and is known today as The Billups Whitfield Place.

In the same year, he built a house in Columbus known as &quot;Snowdoun&quot;, featured annually on a local tour of homes. It was here that Jefferson Davis stayed while campaigning across the state for the U.S. Senate. He gave a speech from the balcony of this house. The home was later visited by author Julian Street as he traveled across the Southern U.S. compiling notes for his book &quot;American Adventures&quot; in 1915.

<text>Jimmie Kenneth Johnson (born September 17, 1975) is an American professional auto racing driver. He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Cup Series, driving the No. 84 Toyota Camry XSE for Legacy Motor Club. Johnson has won seven Cup championships, including five consecutive titles, tying him with Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most all-time. He is widely considered one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history.

Johnson was born in El Cajon, California, and began racing motorcycles at the age of four. After graduating from Granite Hills High School he competed in off-road series. He raced in Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group (MTEG), Short-course Off-road Drivers Association (SODA), and SCORE International, winning rookie of the year in each series. In 1998, Johnson and his team, Herzog Motorsports, began stock car racing. He moved to the national American Speed Association (ASA) series for late model touring cars, and won another rookie of the year title. In 2000, he switched to the NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series).

His talent was noticed by Hendrick Motorsports driver Jeff Gordon, who convinced owner Rick Hendrick to sign Johnson in the Winston Cup Series full-time for 2002, with Gordon as a part-owner of his car. After finishing fifth in the points in his first full season, he was second in 2003 and 2004 and fifth in 2005. Johnson won his first Cup Series championship in 2006 and with further wins in 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010, he became the first and only driver in NASCAR history to win five consecutive championships. Johnson finished sixth in the points standings in the 2011 season and third in 2012 before winning his sixth championship in 2013. In 2016, Johnson won his seventh championship, tying Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most Cup Series championships of all time. Johnson is also a two-time winner of the Daytona 500, winning in 2006 and 2013. Between 2002 and 2017, Johnson recorded seven championships, 83 career race wins, 222 top fives, 341 top tens, and 35 pole positions. From 2021 to 2022, Johnson competed in the IndyCar Series for Chip Ganassi Racing, and has competed occasionally in sports car racing throughout his career.

==Racing career==
===Beginnings===
====Off-road racing====
Johnson started racing motorcycles in 1980 when he was four. Three years later, he won the 60cc class championship, despite injuring his knee. Afterward, he moved to the Mickey Thompson Entertainment Group (MTEG) Stadium Racing Series where he won several more awards. In 1993, Johnson was given the opportunity to drive for Herb Fishel. He refused the deal and continued racing buggies and trucks in off-road stadium and desert races. He also reported for ESPN in the Short-course Off-road Drivers Association (SODA). Three years later, Johnson drove for Herzog Motorsports in the off-road truck series in 1996. By 1997, Johnson had progressed to SODA&#x27;s Class 8; Class 8 is short-course off-road racing&#x27;s class of two-wheel-drive Trophy Trucks which generate about 800 horsepower. He battled Scott Taylor and Brendan Gaughan for the championship. That year, Johnson won both races at Lake Geneva Raceway&#x27;s first race weekend in May. He also won the season&#x27;s third event at Antigo before finishing second to Gaughan at Antigo&#x27;s second race. Johnson returned to Lake Geneva in July, winning the Saturday race and finished second on the following day. Taylor ended up winning the championship with Gaughan second and Johnson third.

In SCORE, he won races and had a few memorable finishes, like that in the 1995 Baja 1000, after leading over 900 miles, he fell asleep behind the wheel and woke up to find himself going off course. His Trophy Truck, Butch (the paint scheme of which was used for a throwback for Johnson&#x27;s 48 car in the 2019 Southern 500, and the car that was used by Larry Ragland in wins such as the 1991 Baja 1000), was wrecked.

During his time in the SODA, SCORE, and MTEG series, he accumulated over 25 wins, 100 Top 3 finishes, six championships, and received Rookie of the Year honors in all three leagues.

====ASA and Busch Series====
In 1997, he began racing on asphalt ovals when he ran three races in the American Speed Association (ASA), making his debut at Hawkeye Downs Speedway. Driving for Herzog Motorsports&#x27; stock car program, he won the ASA Pat Schauer Memorial Rookie title in 1998. One year later, he had two wins and finished third in the standings. Johnson finished second in the two races at Fairgrounds Speedway he participated in over those two years.

Johnson made his NASCAR Busch Series (now NASCAR Xfinity Series) debut at the 1998 Indianapolis Raceway Park event, where he finished 25th for ST Motorsports. He continued his limited slate in 1999 with Herzog Motorsports before moving to a full-time schedule in 2000. At Watkins Glen International, he had a spectacularly hard accident on lap 46 when his brakes failed entering the first turn. He had to swerve quickly to the right to avoid the No. 86 of Dennis Demers, but went into the grass on the inside of turn one, then went back across the track, caught some air on the gravel trap before finally crashing head-on into the Styrofoam barriers at the far end of the turn while still more than 150+ MPH. He eventually climbed out of the car unscathed and raised his fists in the air like he had won the race. Johnson noted he was &quot;so happy to be alive and OK. The next couple of days I was really sore.&quot; Otherwise, in a rather uneventful season which featured one DNQ at Daytona and six Top 10&#x27;s, he finished tenth in the point standings.

In 2001, he recorded one win at Chicagoland Speedway, and finished eighth in the point standings, his win at Chicagoland was his only throughout his career at the track. During the year, he joined Hendrick Motorsports for a four-race schedule in the Winston Cup Series, making his series debut in the UAW-GM Quality 500 at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway. The opportunity was made available when he connected with Hendrick driver Jeff Gordon during the 2000 Busch season; with Herzog facing shutdown due to sponsorship issues, Johnson approached Gordon and was informed of the team&#x27;s intention to field a fourth car for him.

Johnson formally moved to Hendrick in 2002, driving the No. 48 Lowe&#x27;s-sponsored Chevrolet.

===NASCAR Cup Series===
====2002–05====
Johnson began racing full-time in the Winston Cup Series during the 2002 season. He earned his first career pole position for the Daytona 500, becoming the third rookie to do so (the first were Loy Allen Jr. in 1994 and Mike Skinner in 1997). In his 13th career start, Johnson scored his first career win in the NAPA Auto Parts 500 at Auto Club Speedway. Johnson became the first rookie driver to lead the point standings and to win twice at the same track during a season, by sweeping both races at Dover. In the Coca-Cola 600, Johnson led 263 laps before he got a penalty for overshooting his pit box. He earned four pole positions and three wins (tying the rookie record set by Tony Stewart in 1999), as well as six Top 5&#x27;s and 21 Top 10 finishes. He finished fifth in the final point standings. However, despite the strong season, Ryan Newman won rookie of the year honors over Johnson, partially due to Newman having 22 Top 10&#x27;s compared to Johnson&#x27;s 21.

In 2003, Johnson finished ninth on the all-time list for consecutive weeks ranked in the Top 10 in points with 69. He won three races (Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte and both New Hampshire races), two poles (at Kansas Speedway and Pocono Raceway), 14 Top 10&#x27;s, and 20 Top 10 finishes, including a second-place finish at Rockingham after leading 78 laps. He also was able to win the All-Star race for the first time, as well as finishing second in the final standings, just 90 points Matt Kenseth and 207 ahead of his future teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr.

In 2004, Johnson started slowly at Rockingham Speedway and Las Vegas Motor Speedway with results of 41st and 16th, after a Top 10 finish in the Daytona 500. However, he quickly was able to rebound winning the Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 at Darlington Raceway. Subsequent victories in the Coca-Cola 600, the Pocono 500, and the Pennsylvania 500 came in the middle of the season, seeing Johnson sweep the Pocono races. However, finishes of 37th and 32nd at Talladega Superspeedway and Kansas moved him toward the bottom of the point standings. Afterward, he was able to win the UAW-GM Quality 500 at Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway. The second victory of the 2004 Chase for the Nextel Cup, at the Subway 500 at Martinsville on October 24, 2004, was marred by tragedy. Owner Rick Hendrick&#x27;s son Ricky, twin nieces, brother, and chief engine builder Randy Dorton as well as Joe Turner, Scott Lathram were killed in an airplane crash en route to the race. All eight passengers and both pilots died in the incident, and Johnson was told after completion of the race. Johnson had a total of eight wins, 20 Top 5&#x27;s and 23 Top 10 finishes. At the end of the season, Johnson finished second in the point standings.

In 2005, Johnson won at Las Vegas, Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway, Dover International Speedway, and then again at Lowe&#x27;s. In total, Johnson had four consecutive wins at his sponsor (Lowe&#x27;s) sponsored track in Charlotte, North Carolina. He won the Coca-Cola 600 that year, which broke the record for the most yellow flags in a Cup Series race, by beating Bobby Labonte by .027 seconds. Johnson had a chance to win the championship coming into the November 20 season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway, but finished fifth in points after crashing at the midway point of the event with a tire problem. He scored 13 Top 5&#x27;s, 22 Top 10 finishes, and one pole position.

====2006–2010: Championship streak====
=====2006=====
In 2006, Johnson began the season by winning the Daytona 500. The Daytona 500 also marked his first race with Earl Barban as the spotter, who won five championships with Johnson and the No. 48 team. He finished second in the next race at California Speedway and won the UAW-DaimlerChrysler 400 at Las Vegas by passing Matt Kenseth on the last lap. Johnson won his third race of the season in the Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega, followed by two more victories at Indianapolis and Martinsville. One highlight of the season was when he saved the car from slamming into the wall when he spun out during qualifications at the first Dover race. Throughout the season, he became the only modern era driver to win at least three races in each of his first five seasons. He started the chase with unfortunate mishaps in the first four races; a DNF at New Hampshire, a pitting mistake at Dover, a penalty at Kansas (he led the most laps in the race), and, while trying to make a pass for first at Talladega, getting clipped and spinning out. He and the team kept their hopes up and rallied with five straight Top 2 finishes including a win at Martinsville to come back from eighth in the points standings to take the championship. At the end of the season, he recorded one pole, 13 Top 5&#x27;s, 24 Top 10&#x27;s, and his first championship title (this was also the first in his NASCAR career). In December, Johnson won the 2006 Driver of the Year Award.

=====2007=====
During the 2007 season, Johnson continued on a streak and recorded 10 wins, four poles, 20 Top 5&#x27;s, and again 24 Top 10 finishes. Those 10 wins included sweeping both races at Richmond, Atlanta, and Martinsville. He also won at Las Vegas, Auto Club, Texas, and Phoenix. Afterward, he won his second consecutive championship title and was named the 2007 Driver of the Year. Johnson also had the best average finish in the Chase with 5.0. At the end of the season, he had a total of 33 career wins, placing him 18th on the all-time wins list.

In December 2007, Johnson commenced a program of exercise sessions and a run schedule supervised by John Sitaras, in order to balance his strength. Sitaras&#x27; initial assessment found that half of his body was much tighter, having acclimated to offsetting the g-force load from turning left while driving. In two years, Johnson&#x27;s body fat percentage dropped from 20% to 8% (visible also in the change of the shape of his face), while his strength and stamina greatly improved. Johnson later became the first racing driver to be named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year (in 2009).

=====2008=====

After the 2008 season, Johnson became the second driver to win three consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championships, the first being Cale Yarborough. During the season, he won seven races (including a sweep at Phoenix), a career-high of six poles, 15 Top 5&#x27;s, and 22 Top 10&#x27;s. In five of those seven wins, he started from the pole. He became the only driver to record three wins in each of their first seven seasons. In 2008 Jimmie Johnson also raced in his first-ever truck series race, the O&#x27;Reilly 200 at Bristol, where he led 28 laps before spinning out on lap 101. That weekend was the first time he had ever sat in a racing truck. In the Chase for the Championship, he recorded 14 wins, eight more than any other driver. One of those included Phoenix in which he won on low fuel and high tire wear after crew chief Chad Knaus decided to stay out late in the race. He also was named the 2008 Driver of the Year and won an ESPY as the Best Driver. After the season, he also moved to third on the active winners&#x27; list.

=====2009=====
In the 2009 season, Johnson recorded his fourth consecutive championship, becoming the only driver to win four back-to-back season titles. Throughout this season, he won seven races (including a third consecutive Checker Auto Parts 500 and both Dover races), four poles, 16 Top 5&#x27;s, and 24 Top 10 finishes. Johnson now became the only driver to win at least three races in each of his first eight seasons, as well as the only driver to qualify for the Chase for the Championship every year since 2004. During the season, he moved up one spot up to second on the active winners&#x27; list and went to 13th on the all-time wins list. After the season concluded, he won an ESPY for the second consecutive year, and won the Driver of the Year award for the third time, tying Jeff Gordon, Mario Andretti, and Darrell Waltrip as the only three-time drivers to win the award.

=====2010=====

During 2010, Johnson won his fifth consecutive championship, becoming the third driver who made up points to win the title since 1975. During the season, he scored two poles, 17 Top 5&#x27;s, 23 Top 10&#x27;s, and six wins. He also remained the only driver to qualify for the Chase every year since its inception in 2004. He became the 12th driver to win 50+ NASCAR races when he won at Bristol in March and went up to 10th on the all-time wins list. His wins in 2010 included Auto Club, Las Vegas, where he passed Jeff Gordon with 16 laps to go for the lead, Bristol, Sonoma, his first and only road course win, New Hampshire, and Dover. At New Hampshire, with eight laps remaining, Kurt Busch, who was running second, bumped Johnson to become the leader, but Johnson returned the favor a couple of laps later to the lead the final two laps. Johnson said, &quot;Kurt knocked me out of the way. At that point, I thought, I don&#x27;t care if I win or finish. I&#x27;m going to run into him one way or the other ... I tried once and moved him. (I thought) I&#x27;ve got to hit him harder. The second time I did and moved him out of the way.&quot;

Johnson was also named Driver of the Year for the fourth time in his career, joining Gordon as the only drivers to win the award that many times. Johnson had been fighting for the championship with Denny Hamlin all season, but eventually passed him in points in the season finale at Homestead.

He also won Tony Stewart&#x27;s charity race, the Prelude to the Dream, his first victory on a dirt oval.
====2011====

In 2011, Johnson began the season with a fourth-place finish in the Budweiser Shootout, after starting from the 23rd position. One week later in the 2011 Daytona 500, he started 23rd, but finished 27th after being involved in a crash on lap 29. During the Subway Fresh Fit 500, he managed a third-place finish. Following a 16th-place finish after the Kobalt Tools 400 he collected two consecutive Top 5 finishes.

Statistically, Johnson&#x27;s 2011 season was one of his worst performances to date, even though he finished sixth in the points. He only won two races during the season. The first was the Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega Superspeedway, where Johnson started on the outside pole and tandem-drafted with Dale Earnhardt Jr. for the entire race. On the last lap, with Johnson in front, he and Earnhardt Jr. were in fifth and sixth off of turn 4, behind two other pairs of cars – their Hendrick teammates Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin, and the Richard Childress drafting pair of Clint Bowyer and Kevin Harvick. In the tri-oval, Earnhardt Jr. gave Johnson enough of a push to nip Bowyer at the finish line by 0.002 seconds. This was the closest recorded finish in Talladega history and tied the 2003 Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 for closest margin of victory in NASCAR history. After finishing in the first 15 positions in the next four races, Johnson failed to finish the Coca-Cola 600 after his engine failed. Three weeks later, in the Heluva Good! Sour Cream Dips 400, Johnson spun off turn two, flattening multiple tires, and breaking the sway bar which prompted him to a finish of 27th. During the Toyota/Save Mart 350, Johnson finished seventh after starting 12th on the grid. The finish moved Johnson to third in the Drivers&#x27; standings.

After returning to Daytona International Speedway for the Coke Zero 400, Johnson and Earnhardt Jr. ran together for most of the race, like at Talladega, until Johnson pitted under a caution flag. Johnson fell down the grid and was involved in a last-lap accident, prompting him to finish 20th. During the next two races, Johnson finished third and fifth in the Quaker State 400 and the Lenox Industrial Tools 301. Two weeks later, Johnson found himself finishing 19th during the Brickyard 400 after coming to pit road with 30 laps remaining in the event. Johnson finished fourth in the Good Sam RV Insurance 500, after bumping Kurt Busch on the final lap. In the next race, Johnson finished tenth. Johnson finished in the Top 5 in the following three races. During the last race of the regular season, the Wonderful Pistachios 400, Johnson finished in the 31st position. While at Chicagoland Speedway for the GEICO 400, Johnson finished 10th. Afterward, Johnson finished 18th in the Sylvania 300, then second in the AAA 400. One week later, Johnson recorded his second victory of the season in the Hollywood Casino 400. During the Bank of America 500, Johnson was involved in a crash and finished 34th. In the following race, Johnson finished second. For the next two races, Johnson finished 14th in each and finished 32nd in the Ford 400 to finish sixth in the Driver&#x27;s championship standings.

The third NASCAR Championship for Tony Stewart marked the first time since 2005 (coincidentally Stewart&#x27;s second) that someone other than Johnson was the champion.

====2012====
Johnson began the 2012 season with a 14th-place finish in the Budweiser Shootout after crashing on lap 74. During the Daytona 500, Johnson was involved in a crash on lap 2 when he turned into the wall after contact from Elliott Sadler, then was t-boned by David Ragan, also collecting Danica Patrick, Kurt Busch and Trevor Bayne. Damage to the car was severe, prompting him to retire and finish 42nd. Afterward, he finished fourth and second in the Subway Fresh Fit 500 and Kobalt Tools 400. While at Bristol Motor Speedway for the Food City 500, Johnson finished in the ninth position, moving him up to 11th in the Drivers&#x27; Standings. Next, Johnson finished tenth in the Auto Club 400, despite having an oil leak, but the rain saved Johnson from a low finish. He went on to finish 12th in the spring event at Martinsville after being involved in a crash on the first green-white-checker attempt. In the following event, the Samsung Mobile 500, Johnson finished second after leading much of the race before he was passed by Greg Biffle. Afterward, he recorded a third-place finish in the STP 400 at Kansas on April 22, 2012, and a sixth-place finish in the Capital City 400 at Richmond one week later. On May 6, 2012, Johnson started 19th in the Aaron&#x27;s 499 at Talladega, but finished 35th after suffering a broken oil pump belt on lap 62.

Johnson won his first race of the season one week later in the Bojangles&#x27; Southern 500 at Darlington. The win was also Rick Hendrick&#x27;s 200th NASCAR Cup Series win. A week later, he matched Gordon and Dale Earnhardt with three wins in the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race after winning the 2012 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race. Next, in the Coca-Cola 600, Johnson finished 11th in the race after a penalty on lap 354. After the Coca-Cola 600, Johnson went on to win his second race of the season in the FedEx 400. In the Pocono 400, he recorded a fourth-place finish after starting 24th on the grid. During the next two races, Johnson placed fifth, moving him to fourth in the standings. Afterward, Johnson finished sixth after winning his first pole position of the season in the Quaker State 400. However, in the Coke Zero 400, Johnson finished 36th after retiring from a crash on lap 124. After finishing seventh during the Lenox Industrial Tools 301, Johnson recorded his third victory of the season and his fourth career win at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, tying Jeff Gordon for what was the record for the most wins in the Brickyard 400.

At Michigan, he was leading late in the race with six laps to go when his engine blew up, giving the race to Greg Biffle.

After making the NASCAR Chase for the Championship, Johnson secured three straight Top 5 finishes in the GEICO 400, Sylvania 300 and AAA 400. Following a 17th-place finish in Good Sam Roadside Assistance 500, Johnson recorded four top-ten finishes, including two consecutive wins from the pole position at Martinsville and Texas, which was his 60th win in the series, to take a seven-point lead over Brad Keselowski. Johnson was able to hold off Keselowski&#x27;s hard racing, which even prompted Tony Stewart to say that he was driving with a &quot;death wish&quot;. At Phoenix, Johnson blew a right front tire, which caused him to collide into the wall and finish in the 32nd position. He was racing for the win and the championship the following week at Homestead, but his chances of winning the championship were over after he had a pit road penalty and had a gear failure and he finished 36th in that race, and finished third in the Drivers Championship behind Keselowski and Bowyer.

====2013: Return to championship form====
In 2013, Johnson began his season with a 14th-place finish in the 2013 Sprint Unlimited when he crashed on lap 14 along with Kyle Busch, Kurt Busch, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon, and Denny Hamlin. Afterward, he placed fourth in the first Budweiser Duel, resulting in a ninth-place starting position in the 2013 Daytona 500. In the Daytona 500, Johnson started well, assuming the lead from Jeff Gordon on lap 32 and leading a handful of laps before falling back to the middle of the pack. Over the last few laps, Johnson was racing alongside Brad Keselowski for the lead until a caution came out for debris. Johnson took the advantage of leading on the last restart. With five laps to go, Johnson led a lane with Greg Biffle and Danica Patrick. He then held off a last-lap charge from Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Mark Martin to win his second Daytona 500. This was Johnson&#x27;s first Daytona 500 win with Knaus, as he won the 2006 race with Darian Grubb as Knaus was serving a five-race suspension. It was also the first time since his 2006 win that he finished better than 27th in the Daytona 500, after a streak of six years where he had never finished better than 27th because of crashes and mechanical failures.

The following week at Phoenix, Johnson started inside the Top 10 and finished second behind Carl Edwards. He followed this with a sixth-place finish at Las Vegas. At Bristol, he was running on the lead lap until a spin late-race forced him back to a 22nd-place finish. At Fontana, he struggled for most of the race, racing near the back of the pack, but salvaged a 12th-place finish. Johnson won his first pole position of the season at Martinsville and had the dominant car, leading 346 of 500 laps on the way to his eighth Martinsville race win. Johnson also assumed the point lead as well, which he held for the remainder of the regular season. Johnson&#x27;s consistency was enough that there were points in the summer where he was more than a full two-race wins&#x27; worth of points ahead of Carl Edwards or Clint Bowyer. Afterward, Johnson finished sixth at Texas. At Kansas, he led nine laps and finished third behind Matt Kenseth and Kasey Kahne. Johnson finished 12th the following week at Richmond, allowing him to build even further on his point lead. At Talladega, he was the only driver besides Matt Kenseth to lead double-digit laps (16) and finished in fifth place. A fourth-place finish the following week at Darlington allowed Johnson to further solidify his point lead over Edwards.

In the 2013 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race, Johnson won his record fourth All-Star race after a fast pit stop allowed him to start the final 10-lap sprint in second, and later passed Kasey Kahne for the victory. One week later, Johnson finished 22nd after spinning sideways late in the race. At Dover, Johnson led 143 laps but finished 17th when he jumped Juan Pablo Montoya on the last restart causing NASCAR to issue him a penalty. He was able to redeem himself for this mistake the following week at Pocono by earning the pole position, leading the most laps, and winning his third race of the season, which increased his point lead to 51 points over Edwards. This also snapped a nine-year winless streak for Johnson at Pocono since sweeping both of the track&#x27;s 2004 NASCAR Cup Series races. At the Quicken Loans 400 at Michigan, Johnson closed in on Greg Biffle for the lead with less than 10 laps left, but suffered a flat tire with less than five laps to go. Johnson finished the race in 28th, his worst finish of the season to that point. Johnson then finished ninth at Sonoma. At Kentucky, Johnson started third. He had the dominant car of the race, leading 182 of 267 laps. However, on a restart on lap 246, Johnson was slow to get up to speed and was subsequently touched and spun by Joey Logano, costing Johnson a shot at the win and giving the race to Matt Kenseth. Johnson was able to charge through the field after the caution and restart to salvage a ninth-place finish.

Returning to Daytona for the Coke Zero 400, Johnson led 94 laps and held off Tony Stewart and Kevin Harvick on a green-white-checker finish to win his fourth race of the year. In winning the race, Johnson became the first driver since Bobby Allison in 1982 to sweep both Daytona races in a season. This was a significant improvement in Johnson&#x27;s runs on the restrictor plate tracks, as he had been crashed out of the running at both Daytona races in 2012, had an engine failure early while leading at Talladega in the spring and was part of a crash on the last lap in the fall. Also, he was one of only three drivers to sweep the top ten, the other two drivers being Ryan Newman and Dale Earnhardt Jr.

At New Hampshire for the Camping World RV Sales 301, Johnson qualified second, but failed post-qualifying inspection after his car was found to be too low, and started the race in 43rd, the first time in his career he started dead last. In the race, Johnson passed seven cars in the first four laps and reached the Top 20 by lap 50, while reaching the top ten by lap 165; Johnson finished sixth. He almost won the pole position at Indianapolis but was bumped to second by Ryan Newman. Johnson led the most laps and almost won, but a slow final pit stop cost him the race to Newman. The following week at Pocono, Johnson won another pole position, setting another track qualifying record. He led 43 of the first 80 laps before he cut a right-front tire that knocked a spark plug loose and affected the handling of the car. Johnson&#x27;s pit crew worked hard to repair the car, fixing the plug on the last pit stop, and managing to salvage a 13th-place finish after racing near the back of the pack for most of the race.

Returning to Michigan, Johnson qualified third but crashed in happy hour, forcing him to a backup car and a 43rd starting spot. After running up to the lead through pit stop strategy, Johnson lost an engine on lap 55, relegating him to a 40th-place finish. This was followed by a streak of three poor finishes of 36th at Bristol, 28th at Atlanta, and 40th at Richmond due to crashes and mechanical failures.

Johnson started the Chase seeded in second place. He started the Chase with a fifth-place finish at Chicago, followed by a fourth-place finish at New Hampshire. At Dover, Johnson led 243 laps and held off Dale Earnhardt Jr. over the last 25 laps to win his eighth race at the track, also redeeming himself for the restart line violation that had cost him a shot at winning the June race.

Johnson spent the next several races chasing Matt Kenseth for the points lead, eventually gaining it at Talladega, though losing it when he and Kenseth tied for the points lead at Martinsville. Returning to Texas, Johnson had the dominant car, leading 255 laps to his sixth win of the season. The following weekend at Phoenix, Johnson avoided trouble in tight racing on two separate occasions (a near scrape in turn 4 on the first lap, and later a near spin after contact with Carl Edwards in turn 1) to escape with a third-place finish. He also capitalized on Kenseth suffering from a poor-handling car. With Kenseth finishing 23rd, Johnson took a 28-point lead to the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway. In the finale, Johnson raced conservatively to a ninth-place finish to secure his sixth title. He closed out the season with six wins, three poles, 16 Top 5&#x27;s, and 24 Top 10&#x27;s, with an average finish of 9.8 and an average start of 10.7.

====2014====

Statistically, 2014 was one of Johnson&#x27;s worst seasons to date. He started the season on an up-and-down note but went winless through the first 11 races of the 2014 season (his best finish was 2nd at Martinsville). Skepticism began to arise, as he had never gone more than 12 races into a season without a win, and hadn&#x27;t gone that long since the first few years of his Cup career. However, Johnson won the Coca-Cola 600, his first win in the race since 2005. Afterward, he went on to win at Dover the following week, making it the 13th time he had back-to-back wins.

A few weeks later, Johnson recorded his first win at Michigan, after several years of being deprived of a shot at victory as the result of running out of gas or blowing an engine. However, he didn&#x27;t keep up with the momentum. After finishing in the top ten at Sonoma and Kentucky, Johnson was collected in an early wreck in the Coke Zero 400, finishing 42nd. Johnson&#x27;s streak of misfortune continued the next several weeks, finishing 42nd for the second week in a row at New Hampshire. This was followed up by an inconsistent run at Indy (14th), and poor showings resulting from accidents at Pocono (39th) and Watkins Glen (28th). Despite the poor finishes, Johnson qualified fourth for the Chase.

In the Chase, Johnson finished 12th at Chicagoland, fifth at New Hampshire, and third at Dover to advance to the Contender Round. However, trouble struck when he finished 40th and 17th in the next two races.

At Talladega, Johnson started second and led a high of 84 laps. However, a 24th-place finish kept him from advancing to the Eliminator Round. At Martinsville, Johnson started seventh but finished 39th after being involved in a crash early in the race. Returning to Texas, Johnson dominated and held off Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick (and Jeff Gordon, who cut a tire on contact with Brad Keselowski late in the race which led to a post-race brawl) to score his third straight win in the fall Texas race, and also ended an 18-race-winless-streak. At Phoenix, he struggled for most of the day and finished 38th after blowing a tire and crashing out. At the season finale at Homestead, Johnson finished ninth and closed out finishing 11th in points. This marks the first time in Johnson&#x27;s NASCAR Cup career that he has finished outside of the Top 10 in the final points.

====2015====

Johnson began his season with a win in the Budweiser Duel. He started the season by finishing fifth in the Daytona 500 for the second year in a row. The following week, he won the Folds of Honor QuikTrip 500 at Atlanta.

At Las Vegas, Johnson crashed twice into the outside wall, leaving him with a 41st-place finish. He rebounded with an 11th-place finish in Phoenix and a ninth-place finish at California, his first Top 10 there in two years. At Martinsville, he struggled to a 35th-place finish. However, his momentum returned at Texas when he held off Kevin Harvick and Dale Earnhardt Jr. to win. At Bristol, he avoided tight trouble early in the race and came home second to polesitter Matt Kenseth. At Richmond, he finished third. These finishes moved him back up to fourth in the standings. At Talladega, Johnson started fifth and led 50 laps, only to finish second to Earnhardt Jr.

At Kansas, Johnson gambled by staying out on the last round of pit stops and held off Harvick and Earnhardt again to win his third race at Kansas and of the season. In winning, he established a Cup record of 23 wins on 1.5-mile tracks, taking what was both his 200th Top 5 and his 300th Top 10 finish. At Charlotte, he spun out on two occasions. The first time was early in the race while running 16th coming out of turn 4 but he was lucky to avoid hitting anything. He wasn&#x27;t so lucky on the second spin late in the race; while running fifth, he spun out again at the same place, and hit the wall in pit road, causing some nose damage. Those spin-outs left him with a 40th-place finish. He rebounded the following week with a win at Dover, and also became one of four drivers to have won 10 or more races at one track. This gave him a total of 74 career wins, two fewer than Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s 76.

At Pocono, Johnson cut a tire on lap 88 but did not take major damage. He was able to work his way through the field to finish in third place. He finished 19th at Michigan after the race was called for rain on lap 138. At Sonoma, Johnson led the most laps at 45 laps, but a late-race caution caused by Casey Mears&#x27; broken wheel axle cost him, and he was passed by Kyle Busch with five laps to go and slipped back to sixth place.

Returning to Daytona, Johnson started 12th and led 35 laps before finishing second to Dale Earnhardt Jr., in a repeat of the Talladega race. At Kentucky, Johnson started sixth and ran inside the Top 10 for most of the night, finishing ninth. At the second stop in Pocono, Johnson, along with two of his Hendrick teammates, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt Jr., took advantage of several cars running out of fuel to finish in the Top 6 (Gordon finished third, Dale Jr. took fourth, Johnson grabbed sixth). At Watkins Glen, despite suffering two penalties (lap 3: Overshooting the entrance to the inner loop, and caution No. 1 (lap 26–28): Speeding through pit road), Johnson rallied to finish 10th. He wasn&#x27;t so lucky at Michigan, as late in the race, he got loose and spun in turn 3, and damaged the splitter on his car, resulting in a 39th-place finish (10 laps down). He rebounded at Bristol by finishing 4th but had bad luck once more at Darlington. He spun out on lap 134 in turn 4, bringing out the seventh caution, and was never a real threat. He ended up 19th. He was able to recover a bit for a ninth-place finish at Richmond and started 1st in the Chase in a three-way tie between him, Kyle Busch, and Matt Kenseth.

Johnson opened up the Chase in a rough way. At Chicagoland, he blew a left front tire early in the race but was able to charge through the field to salvage an 11th-place finish. He also was the subject of controversy when he made contact with Kevin Harvick on a three-wide pass that led to Harvick cutting a left rear tire, leaving Harvick with a 42nd-place finish.

At Loudon, Johnson finished sixth after blowing a tire in the third position. At Dover, his Chase hopes came to an end when his car broke a driveline, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s career wins. Also in the process, he snapped a 20-race-winless-streak.

Johnson finished fifth at Phoenix, and for the third year in a row, he finished ninth at Homestead. Also in the process, he edged out Ryan Newman by one point to finish 10th in the final standings. With the retirement of his teammate and mentor, Jeff Gordon, Johnson assumed the active wins record with 75.

====2016: The seventh title====

Johnson began the 2016 season with a 16th-place finish at the Daytona 500. In the next race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, he won his first race of the season and the 76th of his career, tying Dale Earnhardt for seventh on the all-time wins list. Johnson finished third and eleventh in the next two events of the season at Las Vegas and Phoenix. His second victory of the season came in the fifth race, the Auto Club 400, where Johnson passed Harvick in an overtime finish. It was also the first time since 2011 that he finished in the Top 5 at the Auto Club Speedway. In the STP 500 at Martinsville Speedway, Johnson recorded a ninth-place finish after moving through the field after qualifying 24th. One week later, Johnson finished fourth in the Duck Commander 500 at Texas Motor Speedway despite suffering minor damage during a 13-car accident that occurred within 50 laps of the finish.

In the Food City 500 at Bristol, Johnson finished 23rd after making an unscheduled pit stop due to a loose lug nut on lap 300. At Richmond, he led 44 laps early in the race and finished third. At Talladega, Johnson was spun by Paul Menard and got involved in a multi-car accident with 28 laps to go, finishing 22nd. Johnson&#x27;s streak of misfortune continued through the next several months, crashing out at Dover, Pocono, Daytona, Kentucky and at Watkins Glen, where he finished last for the first time in his career. His Top 10 finishes during the period came only in the Coca-Cola 600 and Brickyard 400, where he finished third in both races. Johnson finished seventh and sixth at Bristol and Michigan the following two weeks but finished 33rd at Darlington after he spun out of turn 4. Johnson then finished 11th at Richmond. He qualified eighth for the Chase.

Johnson began the Chase for the Championship by leading a race-high 118 laps at Chicagoland, but received a speeding penalty during a green flag pit stop late in the race, ultimately finished 12th. Johnson finished eighth the following week at Loudon. At Dover, Johnson led 90 laps but once again received a pit road penalty with 105 laps to go, costing him a win. He charged through the field and finished seventh (1st car a lap down) and moved to the &quot;Round of 12&quot; of the Chase.

At Charlotte, Johnson led a race-high 155 laps and won the Bank of America 500, claiming his eighth win at the track and the third win of the season, also snapping his 24-race winless streak. This marked Johnson&#x27;s first appearance in the &quot;Round of 8&quot; under the current Chase system. He then finished 4th at Kansas and 23rd at Talladega. At Martinsville, Denny Hamlin aggressively made contact with Johnson on lap 198 and had a tire rub to cause a caution but was able to stay on the lead lap. Later during a caution on lap 362, he lost fuel pressure but was able to get the car refired and stayed on the lead lap again. After the restart, he took the lead from Hamlin and led the final 92 laps to win the Goody&#x27;s Fast Relief 500. This locked him into the Championship 4 for the final race at Homestead. Johnson finished 11th in the rain-shortened race at Texas, and 38th at Phoenix after being penalized a lap for passing the pace car coming down to pit road and involved in a wreck on a restart.
Johnson claimed his seventh championship by winning at Homestead on November 20. After losing his starting spot due to a pre-race inspection fault, Johnson started at the rear of the field. He progressed through the field, cracking the Top 10 quickly, but remained stagnant around fifth-place for a majority of the race. On a restart with 10 laps to go, Carl Edwards came across the nose of Joey Logano, hit the inside wall, and triggered a massive wreck, ending Edwards&#x27; championship hopes. Johnson avoided the accident and was put into the position to win the title. On the final restart, he passed Kyle Larson, winning the race and his seventh championship, tying Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for the most all-time of championships.

====2017: Final NASCAR wins====

Johnson came into 2017 as the defending NASCAR Cup Series champion. The start of the season didn&#x27;t go as smoothly as the end of last season, however. Through the first six races of the season, Johnson only scored one Top 10 finish. He then rebounded with back-to-back wins at the 2017 O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts 500 in Texas (started from the rear of the field) and the 2017 Food City 500 at Bristol, his first win at The Last Great Coliseum since 2010. This would be the 14th and final time he won back-to-back races in his career. The following week, Johnson would finish just outside the Top 10 at Richmond, after colliding with teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr late in the event, leading to an eventual flat tire and spin for the driver of the No. 88.

Johnson scored his third win of the season at Dover in June after passing Kyle Larson on an overtime restart, which ended under caution with a multicar incident behind the two leaders. This was Johnson&#x27;s record-holding 11th win at Dover and 83rd career victory, tying him with NASCAR Hall of Famer, Cale Yarborough. This would eventually be Johnson&#x27;s final NASCAR Cup Series win.

The rest of the season didn&#x27;t go smoothly for Johnson. In the week following his Dover triumph, during the Axalta presents the Pocono 400, Johnson&#x27;s brakes failed into turn 1 at a speed of over 200 MPH, resulting in a tremendous impact with the outside SAFER barrier. Similarly, directly behind Johnson, fellow competitor Jamie McMurray also experienced a brake failure, and impacted the wall hard, igniting a large vehicle fire. Both Johnson and McMurray were uninjured in the accident.

Johnson suffered a big slump during the summer part of the season, failing to earn a Top 5 finish, and only netting three Top 10 finishes. During that stretch, in the 2017 Brickyard 400 on a late race restart, Johnson&#x27;s Lowe&#x27;s-sponsored Chevrolet started billowing smoke while running in third-place. Heading into turn 3, the two race leaders Brad Keselowski and Kasey Kahne battled one another, allowing Johnson to close in and make a three-wide move to the inside. Without much space into the corner, and with the obvious mechanical failure, the car broke sideways and impacted the outside retaining wall hard. The following week, Johnson had another run-in with teammate Kasey Kahne, resulting in a second consecutive DNF; his third in the last four races. Regardless, Johnson (from his wins earlier in the season) was able to qualify for the playoffs.

Entering the 2017 NASCAR Cup Series Playoffs, the defending champion was still one of the favorites to win the title, despite his results over the summer stretch. After earning his first Top 5 finish (third) since his Dover victory, fittingly in the fall Dover event, he advanced through the opening round and into the Round of 12. Johnson scored a seventh-place finish at Charlotte to open the second round, but the following week was involved in &quot;The Big One&quot; at Talladega. He was scored with a 24th-place result, after his car was disqualified for violating the NASCAR Damaged Vehicle Policy in which his crew worked on the car during the red flag. In the elimination race at Kansas Speedway, Johnson entered with a seven-point advantage. After having two separate spins, he drove his way through a large multicar accident off turn 2, involving Playoff drivers Matt Kenseth and Jamie McMurray, and rebounded with an 11th-place finish. Assisted by fellow Playoff contenders finding trouble, Johnson qualified into the Round of 8, by just nine points.

Unfortunately, Johnson&#x27;s performance slipped in the third round. He finished 12th at Martinsville, but was followed by a disappointing 27th-place result at Texas. Entering the final race in the round at Phoenix, Johnson was 51 points behind the Playoff cutoff, and in a near must-win situation. However, on lap 148, Johnson&#x27;s hopes at an eighth championship ended when he blew a tire in turn 3, and hit the outside wall hard, ending his day and eliminating him from the Playoffs. Johnson finished 10th in the final standings, his 15th and final Top 10 finish in the points standings.

====2018: Final season with Knaus and Lowe&#x27;s====

Johnson&#x27;s Speedweeks did not go smoothly, wrecking in each of his three races. At the Advance Auto Parts Clash, he was wrecked on the last lap by Kyle Larson; this was the seventh year in a row he failed to finish the Clash. Johnson qualified third for the 2018 Daytona 500 but had to go to a backup car after wrecking in his Duel. On lap 59 of the Daytona 500, he got caught up in a wreck started by Ryan Blaney, and Ricky Stenhouse Jr., which also involved his teammate William Byron, Erik Jones, Daniel Suárez, Trevor Bayne, and Ty Dillon and ended up 38th. Since then, Johnson struggled throughout the 2018 season with only two Top 5s and eight Top 10 finishes by the time he barely made the Playoffs for the 15th season in a row. Johnson&#x27;s only great run of the season came at the Charlotte Roval race where he ran in the Top 10 for most of the day and battled Martin Truex Jr. for the win on the final lap, but he locked his brakes on turn 17 and spun out of control, taking Truex out with him in the process while Blaney passed them to win the race. Johnson finished eighth, and as a result of a three-way tie with 0 points, he was eliminated in the Round of 16. Johnson scored only one more top-ten finish afterward and wound up a then career-worst 14th in the final point standings since running full-time in 2002, winless for the first time in his career along with equaling a career-low 11 Top 10 finishes for the second season in a row.

Johnson notably gave teammate and friend Chase Elliott a push to the front stretch when his car ran out of fuel when being congratulated by the rest of the drivers after recording his first career win, at Watkins Glen.

On March 14, 2018, Lowe&#x27;s announced they would no longer sponsor the No. 48 car after the 2018 season; Ally Financial assumed primary sponsorship of the team in 2019 on a two-year deal. Johnson and his long-time crew chief Knaus parted ways at the end of the season, ending a 17-year partnership, the longest in NASCAR history. Johnson was paired with JR Motorsports crew chief Kevin Meendering in the 2019 season.

====2019====

The 2019 season started on a positive note for Johnson, as he won the 2019 Advance Auto Parts Clash after contact between him and Paul Menard sent Menard spinning while battling for the lead and triggering &quot;The Big One&quot; on lap 55 right before the rain arrived. It was also the first race with new sponsor Ally Financial and crew chief Meendering. He followed it up by finishing eighth in the first duel race. In the Daytona 500, Johnson ran up front most of the race, but when he came to pit road with around 40 to go, B. J. McLeod and Cody Ware&#x27;s cars spun behind him and hit him in the left rear. The contact ripped off the left rear quarter-panel. He recovered to finish ninth after being two laps down. In the next race at Atlanta Motor Speedway, Jimmie finished 24th, two laps down. He followed up by finishing 19th. He followed up that performance with a ninth-place finish. On March 29 in O&#x27;Reilly Auto Parts 500 qualifying at Texas, Johnson got his first pole since 2016 at Texas and scored his first Top 5 finish since the 2018 Coca-Cola 600 two days later. At the Coca-Cola 600, Johnson ran well and ended up finishing eighth. At Chicagoland Speedway, Johnson started fourth and took the lead on lap 7 from Austin Dillon. He went on to finish fourth followed by a third-place finish at the rain-shortened Coke Zero Sugar 400 a week later, his best finishes of the season.

On July 29, 2019, following a string of disappointing finishes during the season, Hendrick Motorsports announced that race engineer Cliff Daniels would replace Meendering as the crew chief of the No. 48. At Watkins Glen, Johnson finished 19th after being spun out by Ryan Blaney, leading to an argument between the two after the race. The animosity between them lasted until Michigan a week later.

In September 2019, Johnson missed the playoffs cut for the first time in his NASCAR career after finishing 35th in the Brickyard 400 due to contact with Kurt Busch and William Byron that sent his car crashing hard into the wall.

Johnson scored four more Top 10 finishes in the playoffs and wound up finishing a career-worst 18th place in the final standings, going winless for the second straight season. Many crashes throughout the season brought down his otherwise promising year.

On October 4, 2019, Ally extended its sponsorship of the No. 48 for three more years through the 2023 season.

====2020: Final full-time season====

On November 20, 2019, Johnson announced that the 2020 Cup season would be his last full-time season of racing, although he did not rule out a part-time schedule after that. The 2020 season started with the Daytona 500 qualifying, he finished fourth for a second year in a row. Later that day, he entered the 2020 Busch Clash as the defending champion. He started 16th and finished 11th after a tire spun on the first restart in overtime. Next race was the 2020 Bluegreen Vacations Duels. He started and finished second behind team-mate William Byron in Duel 2. In his last Daytona 500, he started sixth and finished 35th after Kyle Busch and Brad Keselowski triggered &quot;The Big One&quot;. Next week in Las Vegas, he finished first in the final practice. He started 18th and finished fifth in the race. At his home track Auto Club, he qualified second, losing the pole position to Clint Bowyer by 0.007 seconds. In the race, his wife and children waved the green flag at the start of the race. There was a four wide salute before the race to honor him. For most of the event, he was in the Top 10 and led 10 laps; he finished seventh.

In The Real Heroes 400 at Darlington, the first race back after the delay forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson was leading in the final lap of the first stage when he lost control of his car and crashed after contact with Chris Buescher who was a lap down at the time. It marked his 100th race in a row without a win. A few days later in the Toyota 500 at the same track, Johnson bounced back with an eighth-place finish in the same track. At the Coca-Cola 600, he qualified second, losing the pole position to Kurt Busch by 0.009 seconds. Johnson finished second in the 600 but was disqualified after his car failed post-race technical inspection. He bounced back with an 11th-place run in Charlotte&#x27;s next race Alsco Uniforms 500.

He enjoyed a pair of top-ten finishes at Bristol and Atlanta. At Martinsville, he overcame a start at 21st and finished third in the first stage, and scored his first stage win of the year and the third of his career in the second segment, but dropped back in the third stage and finished tenth. He fell back early due to car issues at Homestead but ended with a strong run to make his way to the Top 20 and finish 16th. The following week at Talladega, Johnson spearheaded a pre-race ceremony in support of Bubba Wallace after it was falsely reported a noose was in his garage; before the race, Johnson texted his peers that he intended to stand with Wallace during the national anthem, with the drivers also pushing his car to the front of pit road. In the race, Johnson was on the verge of taking the lead with three laps remaining before being spun by Harvick.

On July 3, 2020, two days before the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis, Johnson announced he had tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing him to miss the race and Justin Allgaier to take over the No. 48. This snapped a 663-race streak in which Johnson started a Cup event. Johnson was cleared to return to racing on July 8, 2020, after testing negative twice, and he received a waiver that allowed him to remain playoff eligible should he qualify. His first race back was the Quaker State 400 at Kentucky, a track at which he had never won before. With 23 laps to go, he was coming off of the fastest three laps of the race and a strong run from ninth to third before taking the inside on a restart and being nipped by Brad Keselowski in the left rear, spinning out. He finished the race in 18th. The next week at Texas, Johnson was again one of the fastest cars, putting up a Top 10 lap before getting loose and hitting the wall in stage 2. On top of that, his crew committed a penalty for too many crew members over the wall. He finished 26th and only two points above the playoff cutoff in the standings. Johnson&#x27;s misfortunes continued at Kansas when he was collected in a third-stage crash while running in the top ten, followed by a first-stage spin at New Hampshire while fighting for a top-five spot.

Prior to the Go Bowling 235 at the Daytona road course, the No. 48 team changed the Ally paint scheme from black to white, which Johnson branded as a &quot;rAlly&quot; livery in an effort to &quot;reset&quot; his luck. Johnson, who had experience at the road course via the 24 Hours of Daytona, finished fourth in a run that he described as &quot;what we needed&quot;.

The final three races of the regular season saw Johnson battling with Byron and Matt DiBenedetto for the final playoff spots. Entering the doubleheader at Johnson&#x27;s strongest track Dover, Johnson was 25 points behind his teammate. He finished seventh and third in the two races while Byron was 28th and fourth, which placed Johnson below Byron by four points with one race before the playoffs, and nine points behind DiBenedetto. The final race, the Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona, began with a strong first stage for Johnson as he finished fifth, ahead of Byron and DiBenedetto. The second stage saw him pit early to avoid having to save fuel, and he took advantage of the drivers pitting later in the stage, for another fifth-place finish. Although the three bubble drivers avoided a late wreck in the final stage, Johnson was collected in &quot;The Big One&quot; with two laps remaining. Although his team was able to salvage the car to meet the minimum speed and finish 17th, DiBenedetto beat him for the last playoff seed by six points. In his post-race interview, Johnson lamented his misfortunes during the year including the Coca-Cola 600 disqualification and the positive COVID-19 test; he drew praise from fans for his humility when he congratulated Knaus, who moved to Byron&#x27;s team, and expressed his gratitude to Hendrick Motorsports for his career.

In the first playoff race, the Cook Out Southern 500 at Darlington, despite being out of the playoffs, Johnson ran in the top five for most of the night in a throwback scheme that combined those of Dale Earnhardt and Richard Petty, to honor the two other seven-time champions. His teammates at Hendrick Motorsports also drove in throwback schemes to honor him in his last year.

During the fall Texas race, Johnson would gain publicity by running a special scheme created by designer Noah Sweet, otherwise known as Lefty or Lefty Designs. Sweet, four months earlier in June, had created a mock Jimmie Johnson scheme adorned with pride flag colors, which had led to an excess of harassment towards Sweet and led him to take a temporary break from social media. During his break, encouragement came from most in the NASCAR community (with the hashtag #WeLoveLefty created and spread), including Johnson himself. In a few weeks, Ally president Andreas Brimmer and Jimmie Johnson would tell Sweet on a video call that he would have his chance to get his design on Johnson&#x27;s car. Sweet, whose favorite driver throughout his life had been Johnson, said &quot;I&#x27;m going to remember it for the rest of my life. I am.&quot; The car eventually ran in the 2020 Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 500, finishing 36th due to engine issues.

Johnson&#x27;s only Top 10 of the playoffs came in his final start with a fifth-place finish in the Season Finale 500 at Phoenix; he was the highest-finishing driver of those not in the Championship Round. After the race, he congratulated teammate Elliott on his maiden championship and performed a Polish victory lap.

He ended his final season with 10 Top 10 finishes, the lowest of his career.

====2023: Legacy Motor Club co-owner, part-time return====

On November 4, 2022, Johnson purchased an ownership stake in Petty GMS Motorsports. In addition, he announced his return to the Cup Series on a part-time basis in 2023, starting with an attempt to make the 2023 Daytona 500.

On January 11, 2023, the team was rebranded under the name Legacy Motor Club, with Johnson announced to be running the No. 84. On February 14, 2023, Johnson made the Daytona 500 entry field by scoring the fastest lap among the non-chartered teams. Johnson finished 31st after being involved in an overtime crash. Johnson would then make a start at the COTA race in March, where he finished 38th after wrecking out on Lap 1. Johnson&#x27;s next start would come at the 2023 Coca-Cola 600 in May. He finished 37th after spinning out twice and only completing 115 laps. On June 26, 2023, Johnson&#x27;s in-laws were involved in a possible murder-suicide at their house in Muskogee, Oklahoma. Johnson was on the original entry list for the Chicago street course race, yet on June 27, 2023, Legacy Motor Club announced they would withdraw his entry from the race due to the tragedy.
Johnson started his 2024 part-time season with a 28th-place finish at the 2024 Daytona 500. He also raced at Texas (29th), Dover (28th), Kansas (38th), Charlotte (29th), and Indianapolis (33rd). On July 26, Legacy Motor Club released crew chief Jason Burdett and several members of the No. 84 team.

On January 27, 2025, Johnson was named majority owner of Legacy Motor Club, with Knighthead Capital Management purchasing a minority stake and former co-owner Maury Gallagher stepping back into an ambassador role. At the 2025 Daytona 500, Johnson finished 3rd, his highest finish at the race since winning in 2013, his highest finish in the Next Gen cars; his previous best was 26th at the 2024 season finale at Phoenix; and his highest finish since the 2020 Drydene 311 doubleheader at Dover.

===IndyCar Series===

In 2020, Johnson participated in a test with IndyCar Series team Chip Ganassi Racing. He initially had a test scheduled in March with Arrow McLaren SP at Barber Motorsports Park before it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a second attempt with Chip Ganassi Racing on the Indianapolis road course in July was postponed when he tested positive for the virus. The CGR test finally took place on July 28, 2020, it was overseen by CGR owner Chip Ganassi and five-time IndyCar champion Scott Dixon (who is, along with Johnson, considered to be one of the best in their respective series) to discuss the car. Johnson said that driving an IndyCar was a &quot;childhood dream&quot; of his.

On September 9, 2020, Johnson announced that he would join Chip Ganassi Racing on a part-time basis in 2021 and 2022 to drive the road and street courses on the IndyCar circuit. The deal left open the possibility of running select NASCAR Cup Series events in conjunction, as Ganassi fielded two cars in NASCAR and could&#x27;ve added a part-time car for Johnson, staying under the four-car maximum for Cup teams. However, in 2021, Ganassi&#x27;s NASCAR operations were sold to Justin Marks and absorbed into the Trackhouse Racing Team the following year. Johnson refused to run the ovals due to safety concerns of racing open-wheel cars on them but after both driving the cars and watching teammate Tony Kanaan run on ovals, he ultimately agreed to run an oval test at Texas to prep himself for the Indianapolis 500.

Throughout the year Johnson largely struggled in IndyCar, frequently running at the back of the field and struggling with spins and accidents.

On December 15, 2021, Johnson announced that he would contest the full 2022 IndyCar schedule driving the No. 48 car for Chip Ganassi Racing. During his first oval race in the series, the XPEL 375 at Texas, Johnson finished a then career-best sixth. Johnson made his Indianapolis 500 debut later in the year. Johnson led two laps and, despite a late race crash, was elected Rookie of the Year for the race. Johnson proceeded to collect his first career IndyCar top 5 in his first ever trip to Iowa Speedway at the Hy-Vee Salute to Farmers 300 presented by Google on July 24, 2022. On September 26, 2022, Johnson announced that he would be stepping back from racing full-time.

===Other racing===

Johnson first raced in the Race of Champions in Europe in 2002. He was eliminated in the first runoff by then world rally champion Marcus Grönholm of Finland but he and Jeff Gordon and Colin Edwards racing as Team USA won the teams&#x27; championship. He returned to the event two years later but lost the quarter finals 0–2 to Mattias Ekström of Sweden who was DTM German Touring Car champion that year. Johnson entered the 2006 Race of Champions but did not start due to injury received just days before the race. He still attended the event to cheer for teammate Travis Pastrana. In the 2007 event, Johnson was eliminated before the quarter-finals by Formula One driver Sébastien Bourdais of France.

In 2004, he started racing in Grand-Am with the 24 Hours of Daytona, where he finished eighth. He also entered the event one year later, which his team, Howard-Boss Motorsports, finished second. Two years later, he entered two events, which were both held at Daytona International Speedway. During the races, his team finished 9th and 19th. In 2008, Johnson moved to Bob Stallings Racing with Alex Gurney and Jon Fogarty to race in the 2008 Rolex 24 at Daytona, where the team finished second. One year later, he returned with GAINSCO/Bob Stallings Racing for his fifth Rolex 24 appearance. During the race, his team finished seventh. He returned to the team in 2010, to race in the Rolex 24 and Sahlen&#x27;s Six Hours of the Glen. During the Rolex 24 at Daytona his team finished 21st, while at Watkins Glen the team finished sixth. He returned to the Rolex 24, in 2011 where his team finished 15th.
He returned to the race in 2021, driving an Ally Financial-sponsored No. 48 Cadillac DPi-V.R for Action Express Racing alongside Simon Pagenaud, Kamui Kobayashi, and Mike Rockenfeller. He finished second for a third time in his career. Alongside Pagenaud and Kobayashi, he will participate in all IMSA Michelin Endurance Cup races for 2021 which include Sebring, Watkins Glen and Road Atlanta. At Sebring, his team finished third but they were moved to the rear of DPi classification for violating drive time rules after Pagenaud was found to have driven more than the maximum 4 hours within a 6-hour time period. The team finished 28th in overall ranking.

On November 26, 2018, Johnson participated in a motorsports cultural exchange with two-time F1 champion Fernando Alonso at Bahrain International Circuit, where both drivers compared their respective race cars.

==Personal life==

Johnson was born on September 17, 1975 in El Cajon, California, the son of Catherine Ellen &quot;Cathy&quot; (née Dunnill) and Gary Ernest Johnson. He has two younger brothers, Jarit and Jessie. Both have made professional off-road racing starts in the . Johnson attended Granite Hills High School, while he raced motorcycles during the weekends. He was a varsity water polo player, diver, and swimmer, and graduated in 1993. The number 48 is retired from all sports teams uniforms at his school and Johnson was inducted into the school&#x27;s Athletic Hall of Fame. Johnson lives in Charlotte, North Carolina like many other NASCAR drivers. He is married to Chandra Janway. They have two daughters.

Johnson is a triathlete, regularly participating in triathlons and long-distance running; the Jimmie Johnson Foundation&#x27;s Wellness Challenge also hosts triathlons. In 2019, he competed in the Boston Marathon, finishing with a time of 3:09:07 and 4,155th overall (3,746th among males and 641st in the Male 40–44 class).

Johnson was close friends with NASCAR competitor Blaise Alexander. Following Alexander&#x27;s death during a racing incident at Charlotte in 2001, which prompted NASCAR as a sanctioning body to require the use of the HANS device by every driver in its top three series, Johnson&#x27;s car has had a flame decal with Alexander&#x27;s initials inside of it at every race. In 2004, following the plane crash that killed the son of Rick Hendrick, Ricky, along with nine others, the tail number of the Hendrick plane that crashed was added alongside Alexander&#x27;s initials.

===The Jimmie Johnson Foundation===
The Jimmie Johnson Foundation was launched by Johnson and his wife, Chandra, in 2006. The foundation helps children, families, and communities in need. In 2007, Johnson opened Jimmie Johnson&#x27;s Victory Lanes in Randleman, North Carolina, which is a four-lane bowling alley for campers at Pattie and Kyle Petty&#x27;s Victory Junction Gang Camp. The foundation supports several charities, including Habitat for Humanity, Hendrick Marrow Program, Make-A-Wish Foundation, and Victory Junction. Every year, it holds a golf tournament in San Diego, which raises money for K-12 public education. Since the beginning, the tournament has raised a total of $8 million to help fund several projects. During 2009 and 2010, the foundation awarded $1.5 million for the Education Champions Grants program. The money is given to public schools in California, Oklahoma, and North Carolina. It helps fund basic needs, such as technology, outdoor classrooms, playground construction, and reading programs. The foundation has also assisted the American Red Cross with disaster relief efforts.

In 2014, Johnson joined the Ban Bossy campaign, as a spokesperson advocating leadership in young girls.

==Legacy==
For his successes, Johnson is often regarded as one of the greatest drivers in NASCAR history. Other drivers and teammates have also lauded Johnson for his leadership and helpfulness, including younger drivers Corey LaJoie (for whom Johnson advocated to get a seat in a Cup car), Chase Elliott, William Byron, Bubba Wallace, Alex Bowman, and Ryan Blaney as well as veterans including Brad Keselowski, Kevin Harvick, Jeff Gordon, and more.

===Awards and honors===
In 2000, &quot;People&quot; recognized Johnson as one of their &quot;Men in the Fast Lane&quot;.

Johnson has won the Driver of the Year Award five times (2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2013). In 2009, he became the first racing driver to win the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year Award in the United States.

Johnson was ranked No. 1 on Forbes.com&#x27;s list of &quot;Most Influential Athletes&quot; for two consecutive years (2011, 2012).

In 2018, Johnson received the fourth-annual Byrnsie Award, named after the late &quot;Fox NASCAR&quot; broadcaster Steve Byrnes, during FS1&#x27;s &quot;RaceDay&quot; prior to the running of the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma Raceway.

===Records and milestones===
At the time of his retirement, Johnson&#x27;s 83 career points-paying victories made him the winningest active NASCAR driver, in sixth place among the all-time Cup Series winners; he is also ranked third among those who have competed during the sport&#x27;s modern era (1972–present). He is tied in first with Dale Earnhardt Sr. and Richard Petty for most NASCAR Cup Series championships, with 7. He also has the most consecutive NASCAR Cup Series championships with 5.

Johnson is the all-time winningest Cup Series driver at the following tracks:
* Auto Club Speedway (6)
* Charlotte Motor Speedway (8)
* Dover International Speedway (11)
* Las Vegas Motor Speedway (4)

<doc id="1102423" wikidata="Q229062" url="?curid=1102423" title="Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya">
<text>Zoya Anatolyevna Kosmodemyanskaya (; September 13, 1923 – November 29, 1941) was a Soviet partisan. She was executed after acts of sabotage against the invading armies of Nazi Germany. But after stories emerged of her defiance towards her captors, she was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union. She became one of the most revered heroines of the Soviet Union.

==Family==
The Kosmodemyansky family name was constructed by joining the names of Saints Cosmas and Damian ( () and () in Russian). From the 17th century, the Kosmodemyansky were priests in the Russian Orthodox Church. Zoya&#x27;s grandfather Pyotr Kosmodemyansky was murdered in 1918 by militant atheists for his opposition to blasphemy.

Zoya Anatolyevna Kosmodemyanskaya (her name is a Russian form of the Greek name Zoe, which means &quot;life&quot;) was born in September 13, 1923 in the village of Osino-Gay () (meaning Aspen Woods), near the city of Tambov. Her father, Anatoly Kosmodemyansky, studied in a theological seminary, but did not graduate. He later worked as a librarian. Her mother, Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya (&quot;née&quot; Churikova), was a school teacher. In 1925, Zoya&#x27;s brother, Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky, was born. Like his sister, he was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union, and, like Zoya, posthumously. In 1929, the family moved to Siberia for fear of persecution. In 1930, they moved to Moscow.

==Life and death==
Kosmodemyanskaya joined the Komsomol in 1938. In October 1941, still a high school student in Moscow, she volunteered for a partisan unit. During the course of her army service, she idealized Tatiana Solomakha, a Red Army soldier who was tortured and killed during the course of the Russian Civil War. She was assigned to the partisan unit 9903 (Staff of the Western Front). At the village of Obukhovo near Naro-Fominsk, Kosmodemyanskaya and other partisans crossed the front line and entered territory occupied by the Germans. They mined roads and cut communication lines.

On November 27, 1941, Kosmodemyanskaya received an assignment to burn the village of Petrishchevo, where a German cavalry regiment was stationed. Together with fellow partisans Boris Krainov and Vasily Klubkov, she set fire to three houses in the village. The partisans believed that one of the houses was being used as a German communications center and that occupying forces were using others for accommodation. The writer A. Zhovtis has disputed these claims, arguing that officially Petrishchevo was not a point of permanent deployment of German troops. However, the villagers said that virtually all the houses of the village were used for accommodation by the German troops transported along the main roads near the village.

After the first attempt at arson, Krainov did not wait for Kosmodemyanskaya and Klubkov at the agreed meeting place and left, returning to his own. Later, Klubkov was also captured by the Germans. Kosmodemyanskaya, having missed her comrades and left alone, decided to return to Petrishchevo and continue the arson campaign. However, the German military authorities in the village had by then organized a gathering of local residents, forming a militia in order to avoid further arson. After being arrested, Kosmodemyanskaya was stripped, beaten, interrogated and tortured with 200 lashes and her body burnt, but refused to give any information. The following morning she was marched to the center of the village with a board around her neck bearing the inscription &#x27;Houseburner&#x27; and hanged.

According to Soviet accounts, final words were:

and to the Germans:

in the Soviet accounts, before the moment of hanging, with the rope on her neck, she said:

The Germans left her body hanging on the gallows for several weeks. One of her breasts was cut off by a drunk German near Christmas Eve, and her body desecrated by Germans or collaborators.

==Fame==

The story of Kosmodemyanskaya&#x27;s death became popular after &quot;Pravda&quot; published an article written by Pyotr Lidov on January 27, 1942. The journalist had heard about her execution from an elderly peasant, and was impressed by her courage. The witness recounted: &quot;They were hanging her and she was giving a speech. They were hanging her and she was threatening them.&quot;

Lidov travelled to Petrishchevo, collected details from local residents and published an article about the then-unknown partisan girl. The article was illustrated by a photograph by Sergei Strunnikov of her exhumed body. According to Russian studies scholar Adrienne Harris, the Pravda article &quot;contained all the hagiographic elements necessary... to ensure Zoya&#x27;s secular canonization as a Hero of the Soviet Union, and to fix her central position in the pantheon of Soviet saints.&quot;

Soon after, Joseph Stalin noticed the article. He proclaimed: &quot;Here is the people&#x27;s heroine&quot;, which started a propaganda campaign honouring Kosmodemyanskaya. Stalin ordered that the soldiers and officers of the 197th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht), which participated in the execution, should not be taken prisoner. In February, she was identified and was awarded the order of Hero of the Soviet Union.

Kosmodemyanskaya&#x27;s account was repeatedly published in &quot;Pravda&quot;. Harris writes that &quot; Recognizing the value of Zoya&#x27;s image and narrative, the Soviet Union quickly began shaping Zoya&#x27;s image to suit its own purposes... The Komsomol and educational system introduced young people to Zoya through organized museum visits, presenta- tions and politically correct readings... Zoya quickly became the most revered Soviet heroine, and numerous Soviet public monuments to her were commissioned, in a top-down manner.&quot;

Numerous Soviet writers, artists, sculptors and poets dedicated their works to her. In 1944, the film &quot;Zoya&quot; was made about her. She was also referred to in the film &quot;Girl No. 217&quot;, which depicted atrocities committed against Soviet prisoners of war by the Nazis. Her image was also used frequently in anti-German propaganda which encouraged violence against the German occupying forces.

Many streets, kolkhozes and Pioneer organizations in the Soviet Union were named after Kosmodemyanskaya. Her portrait became a part of ceremonial procedures of commemoration performed by pioneers, and was used as a symbol of the highest distinction awarded to the best class in school. The Soviets erected a monument in her honour not far from the village of Petrishchevo. Another statue is located at the Partizanskaya Moscow Metro station. A 4108-meter (13,478 feet) mountain peak in Trans-Ili Alatau is named after her. A minor planet 1793 Zoya, discovered in 1968 by Soviet astronomer Tamara Mikhailovna Smirnova, is named after her. Kosmodemyanskaya is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

In the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, a Kosmodemyanskaya monument was destroyed on 21 April 2022 amidst a derussification campaign. In December 2022 the Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya street in Ukraine&#x27;s capital Kyiv was renamed to (World War I Ukrainian Sich Riflemen member) Sofia Halechko street.

Zoya Phan, an outspoken political activist for the Karen people and member of the Burma Campaign UK, was named after Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya by her father, Padoh Mahn Sha Lah Phan. He chose the name because he had read about Kosmodemyanskaya while studying at Yangon University and saw several parallels between the Karen resistance against the Burmese government and the Soviet resistance against the Nazis in Europe.

==Post-Soviet research and controversy==

===1990s media controversy===
Kosmodemyanskaya&#x27;s life became a subject of media controversy during the 1990s. In September 1991, an article by Aleksandr Zhovtis was published in the weekly Russian magazine &quot;Argumenty i Fakty&quot;. The article alleged that there were no German troops in the village of Petrishchevo, in spite of several photos of her being hanged by German soldiers. Zhovtis blamed Stalin&#x27;s scorched earth policy for the &quot;unnecessary&quot; death of the young woman. The newspaper subsequently published letters from readers, many of which included stories contradicting the mainstream version. One researcher claimed that the person executed in Petrishchevo was not Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya but a &quot;missing in action&quot; partisan, although later official conclusion from the Institute for Criminal Expertise and the Department of Justice of the Russian Federation stated otherwise. The &quot;Argumenty i Fakty&quot; articles prompted a response from &quot;Pravda&quot; observer Viktor Kozhemyaka in the form of an article titled &quot;Fifty years after her death Zoya is tortured and executed again&quot;. Ten years later, Kozhemyaka wrote another article &quot;Zoya is executed yet again&quot;, in which he lamented some &quot;absurd material&quot; on Internet discussion forums, which alleged that Zoya had hurt Russian peasants rather than German troops, that she had schizophrenia, and that she was a fanatical Stalinist.

In 1997, the newspaper &quot;Glasnost&quot; published the previously unknown protocols of the official commission of residents of Petrishchevo village and Gribtsovsky selsoviet from January 25, 1942 (two months after Zoya&#x27;s execution). The protocols stated that Kosmodemyanskaya was caught while trying to destroy a stable containing more than 300 German horses. They also described her torture and execution.

A slightly different story was recorded in the notes of researcher Pyotr Lidov, published in &quot;Parlamentskaya Gazeta&quot; in 1999. According to these, Kosmodemyanskaya and Vasily Klubkov were caught while asleep on the outskirts of Petrishchevo. The Germans were called by Petrishchevo resident Semyon Sviridov. Lidov&#x27;s notes also included an interview with a German noncommissioned officer taken prisoner by the Red Army. The interview described the negative effect on the morale of the German soldiers who witnessed the burning of the houses.

===Klubkov&#x27;s betrayal version===
Some details of Kosmodemyanskaya&#x27;s assignment and arrest were classified for about sixty years because treachery might have been involved. The case was declassified in 2002, and then reviewed by Russia&#x27;s Chief Military Prosecutor Office, and it was decided that Vasily Klubkov, who betrayed Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, was not eligible for rehabilitation. According to the case, three Soviet combatants, Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya, Vasily Klubkov, and their commander Boris Krainov, had to perform acts of sabotage in Reichskommissariat Ostland. They had been given the task of setting fire to houses in the village of Petrishchevo, where German troops were quartered. Krainov was to operate in the central part of the village, Kosmodemyanskaya in the southern and Klubkov in the northern parts. Krainov was the first to carry out his task and returned to the base. Kosmodemyanskaya performed her task too, and three columns of flame in the southern part of Petrishchevo were seen from the base. Only the northern part was not set on fire. According to Klubkov, he was captured by two German soldiers and taken to their headquarters. A German officer threatened to kill him, and Klubkov gave him the names of Kosmodemyanskaya and Krainov. After this, Kosmodemyanskaya was captured by the Germans.

<text>Prittlewell Square is a park situated in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, England overlooking the Thames Estuary. It is the oldest park in Southend-on-Sea.

The clock at the entrance to the Square was donated by local jeweller and philanthropist R A Jones. The Square lies within the Clifftown Conservation Area, which was designated in 1968 due to the historic and architectural significance of the area.

<doc id="1102445" wikidata="Q52409" url="?curid=1102445" title="Marcel Carné">
<text>Marcel Albert Carné (; 18 August 1906 – 31 October 1996) was a French film director. A key figure in the poetic realism movement, Carné&#x27;s best known films include &quot;Port of Shadows&quot; (1938), &quot;Le Jour Se Lève&quot; (1939), &quot;Les Visiteurs du Soir&quot; (1942) and &quot;Children of Paradise&quot; (1945); the latter has been cited as one of the great films of all time.

==Biography==
Born in Paris, France, the son of a cabinet maker whose wife died when their son was five, Carné began his career as a film critic, becoming editor of the weekly publication, &quot;Hebdo-Films&quot;, and working for &quot;Cinémagazine&quot; and &quot;Cinémonde&quot; between 1929 and 1933. In the same period he worked in silent film as a camera assistant with director Jacques Feyder. By age 25, Carné had already directed &quot;Nogent, Eldorado du dimanche&quot; (1929), his first short film. He assisted Feyder (and René Clair) on several films through to &quot;La kermesse héroïque&quot; (1935).

Feyder accepted an invitation to work in England for Alexander Korda, for whom he made &quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937), but made it possible for Carné to take over his project, &quot;Jenny&quot; (1936), as its director. The film marked the beginning of a successful collaboration with surrealist poet and screenwriter Jacques Prévert. This collaborative relationship lasted for more than a dozen years, during which Carné and Prévert created their best remembered films. Together, they were involved in the poetic realism film movement of fatalistic tragedies; Ginette Vincendeau said that &quot;the movement&#x27;s greatest classics are probably Marcel Carné&#x27;s &quot;Le Quai des brumes&quot; in 1938 and &quot;Le Jour Se Lève&quot; in 1939.&quot;

Under the German occupation of France during World War II, Carné worked in the Vichy zone where he subverted the regime&#x27;s attempts to control art; several of his team were Jewish, including Joseph Kosma and set designer Alexandre Trauner. Under difficult conditions they made Carné&#x27;s most highly regarded film (&quot;Children of Paradise&quot;, 1945) released after the Liberation of France. In the late 1990s, the film was voted &quot;Best French Film of the Century&quot; in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals. Post-war, he and Prévert followed this triumph with what at the time was the most expensive production ever undertaken in the history of French film. But the result, titled &quot;Les Portes de la nuit&quot;, was panned by the critics and a box-office failure and was their last completed film.

By the 1950s, Carné&#x27;s reputation was in eclipse. The critics of &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot;, who became the film makers of the New Wave, dismissed him and placed his films&#x27; merits solely with Prévert. Other than his 1958 hit &quot;Young Sinners (Les Tricheurs)&quot;, Carné&#x27;s postwar films met with only uneven success and many were greeted by an almost unrelenting negative criticism from the press and within members of the film industry. In 1958, Carné was the Head of the Jury at the 6th Berlin International Film Festival. His 1971 film &quot;Law Breakers&quot; was entered into the 7th Moscow International Film Festival. Carné made his last film in 1976.

Carné supposedly was homosexual. Several of his films (&quot;Hôtel du Nord&quot;, &quot;Les Visiteurs du soir&quot;, &quot;Les Enfants du paradis&quot;, &quot;Le Quai des brumes&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Air de Paris&quot; and &quot;La Merveilleuse visite&quot;) contain references to male homosexuality or bisexuality. His one-time partner was Roland Lesaffre, who appeared in many of his films.

Edward Baron Turk has published a biography of Carné titled &quot;Child of Paradise: Marcel Carné and the Golden Age of French Cinema&quot;.

Marcel Carné died in 1996 in Clamart, Hauts-de-Seine, and he was buried in the Cimetière Saint-Vincent in Montmartre.

<doc id="1102449" wikidata="Q34408" url="?curid=1102449" title="Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib">
<text>Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib (; ; ) was the father of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was the son of Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim and Fatima bint Amr of the Makhzum Clan.

He was married to Aminah bint Wahb. Muhammad was their only child.

==Name==
&quot;ʿAbd Allāh&quot; means &quot;servant of God&quot; or &quot;slave of God&quot;. His full name was ʿAbdullāh ibn ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib ibn Hāshim (&#x27;Amr) ibn Abd Manāf (al-Mughīra) ibn Qusayy (Zayd) ibn Kilāb ibn Murra ibn Ka`b ibn Lu&#x27;ayy ibn Ghālib ibn Fahr (Quraysh) ibn Mālik ibn an-Naḑr (Qays) ibn Kinānah ibn Khuzaymah ibn Mudrikah (&#x27;Āmir) ibn Ilyas ibn Muḍar ibn Nizār ibn Ma&#x27;ādd ibn &#x27;Adnān.

==Marriage==
His father chose for him Āminah daughter of Wahb ibn &#x27;Abd Munāf who was the grandson of Zuhrah ibn Kilab, the brother of his great-great-grandfather Qusayy ibn Kilāb. Wahb had been the chief of Banu Zuhrah as well as its eldest and noblest member but had died some time previously and Āminah became a ward of his brother Wuhaib, who had succeeded him as chief of the clan.

His father went with him to the quarter of Banū Zuhrah. There, he sought the residence of Wuhayb and went in to ask for the hand of Wahb&#x27;s daughter for his son. &#x27;Abdullāh&#x27;s father fixed his marriage with Aminah. It was said that a light shone out of his forehead and that this light was the promise of a Prophet as offspring. Many women approached &#x27;Abdullāh, who is reported to have been a handsome man, so that they might gain the honor of producing his offspring. However it is believed that, as decided by God, the light was destined to be transferred to Āminah through &#x27;Abdullāh after consummating the marriage.
After marrying Aminah Bint Wahb, Abdullah Ibn Abd al-Muttalib lived with her for three days; it was their custom that a man could live for three nights only with his wife in her father&#x27;s family.

==Wedding==

At the wedding ceremony, Abd al-Muttalib chose Wuhayb&#x27;s daughter Halah for himself. When Abd al-Muttalib proposed to Wuhayb, he agreed. And so on the same occasion Abd al-Muttalib and Abdullah married Halah and Amina respectively. Later, Halah gave birth to Hamza, who was Muhammad&#x27;s both uncle and foster brother.

==Death==
Soon after his marriage, &#x27;Abdullāh was called to Syria (in what is &quot;Ash-Shām&quot; or the Levant) on a trading caravan trip. When he left, Āminah was pregnant. He spent several months in Gaza, and on his return trip he stopped for a longer rest with the family of his paternal grandmother, Salma bint Amr, who belonged to the Najjar clan of the Khazraj tribe in Medina. &#x27;Abdullāh was preparing to join a caravan to Mecca when he fell ill. The caravan went on without him to Mecca with news of his illness. Upon the caravan&#x27;s arrival in Mecca, &#x27;Abdul-Muttalib immediately sent his eldest son Al-Harith to Medina. However by the time al-Harith arrived, &#x27;Abdullāh had died. Al-Harith returned to Mecca to announce &#x27;Abdullāh&#x27;s death to his aged father and his pregnant wife Āminah. According to Ibn Sa&#x27;d, Abdullah died three months after his marriage and was twenty-five years old when he died.

He was buried in Dar-ul-Nabeghah in Medina (today Saudi Arabia), and his mausoleum was demolished on the 20th or 21 January 1978. Reportedly he was reburied in Al-Baqee&#x27; Graveyard, next to Muhammad&#x27;s son Ibrahim.

==Estate==
&#x27;Abdullāh left five camels, a herd of sheep and goats, and an Abyssinian slave nurse, called Umm Ayman, who was to take care of his son Muhammad. This patrimony does not prove that &#x27;Abdullāh was wealthy, but at the same time it does not prove that he was poor. Rather, it shows that Muhammad was his heir. Furthermore, &#x27;Abdullāh was still a young man capable of working and of amassing a fortune. His father was still alive and none of his wealth had as yet been transferred to his sons.

==Fate in the afterlife==
Islamic scholars have long been divided over the religious beliefs of Muhammad&#x27;s parents and their fate in the afterlife. One transmission by Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah states that Allah (God) refused to forgive Āminah for her &quot;kufr&quot; (disbelief). According to another sahih (authentic) hadith Muhammad clarified that his own father was in the Fire. Another transmission in Musnad al-Bazzar states that Muhammad&#x27;s parents were brought back to life and accepted Islam, then returned to the &quot;Barzakh&quot;. Some Ash&#x27;ari and Shafi&#x27;i scholars argued that neither would be punished in the afterlife, as they were &quot;Ahl al-fatrah&quot;, or &quot;People of the interval&quot; between the prophetic messages of &#x27;Isa (Jesus) and Muhammad. The concept of &quot;Ahl al-fatrah&quot; is not universally accepted among Islamic scholars, and there is debate concerning the extent of salvation available for active practitioners of &quot;Shirk&quot; (Polytheism), though the majority of scholars have come to agree with it, and disregard the &quot;hadith&quot; (narrations) that state that Muhammad&#x27;s parents were condemned to hell.

While a work attributed to Abu Hanifah, an early Sunni scholar, stated that both Āminah and &#x27;Abdullāh died upon their innate nature (&quot;Mata &#x27;ala al-fitrah&quot;), some later authors of &quot;mawlid&quot; texts related a tradition in which Āminah and &#x27;Abdullāh were temporarily revived and embraced Islam. Scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah stated that this was a lie, though Al-Qurtubi stated that the concept did not disagree with Islamic theology. According to Ali al-Qari, the preferred view is that both the parents of Muhammad were Muslims. According to Al-Suyuti, Isma&#x27;il Haqqi, and other Islamic scholars, all of the narrations indicating that the parents of Muhammad were not forgiven were later abrogated when they were brought to life and accepted Islam. Shia Muslims believe that all of Muhammad&#x27;s ancestors, Āminah included, were monotheists who practiced the shariah of Abraham, and were therefore entitled to Paradise. A Shia tradition states that Allah forbade the fires of Hell from touching either of Muhammad&#x27;s parents.

<text>The Subskimmer is a diver propulsion vehicle which is a form of rigid inflatable boat (RIB) with an outboard petrol (gasoline) engine. It is equipped to inflate and deflate itself as it runs. When submerged it seals its engine and runs with battery-electric thrusters, which are on a rotatable cross-arm, and is deflated. Thus it transforms between a fast light surface boat and a submerged diver propulsion vehicle. The central box contains the pump to deflate and inflate the tubes, and a miscellaneous kit. The batteries, being heavy, are in a thick tube along its keel. Its outboard motor has a long snorkel so the Subskimmer can run on motor just submerged to try to avoid detection. Its thrusters are on a rotatable cross-arm which contains navigation kit.

The Subskimmer project was started in the late 1970s by Submarine Products Ltd. of Hexham in Northumberland in England, the first boats being sold in their original form in 1983/84.

There are 3 photographs of a working Subskimmer demonstrated in Portsmouth, in the 15 September 1983 edition of the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper; the caption states its range as at underwater and at on the surface. Submarine Products Ltd also built an orange search and rescue version of Subskimmer called Seasearcher with high intensity submersible spotlights fitted.

When Submarine Products Ltd closed down, Subskimmer (as at 1989) was made by Defence Boats Ltd, based in Hexham.

At December 1992 it was being made (renamed Kraken 90) by Serrico, who were based at Saint-Georges-du-Vièvre in Normandy in France.

In 1993 KSA (Underwater) Ltd in Alston in Cumbria, England bought all rights to the Subskimmer. KSA (Underwater) Ltd gave some marketing rights to Alpha Champ Marine Products Ltd, who defaulted on payment for the rights and all agreements with them subsequently lapsed. Alpha Champ Marine Products Ltd ceased to trade in 2007 and was dissolved in 2009.

In 2009, Special Products division of Marine Specialised Technology Limited bought KSA (Underwater) Ltd along with all rights to its product range including Subtug and Subskimmer Submersible Craft, and moved all production to its manufacturing facility in Liverpool where it already designs and manufactures surface craft for military and commercial applications.

As of December 2014, it appears that Subskimmers are being made in Indonesia for its armed forces.

==Users==
Subskimmers are used by:
*The Royal Thai Navy Marine Corps 
==Other uses of the name==
The word &quot;subskimmer&quot; has been found on the WWW used also (incorrectly, as it is a registered trade name) to mean:
*An Exocet-type anti-ship missile.
*As a generic referring to the Infernus a Subskimmer-like boat that was designed and made by students at KTH in Sweden in academic year 2003–2004. Its introduction refers to &quot;denna&quot; (this) &quot;subskimmer, Infernus&quot;.

<doc id="1102451" wikidata="Q3905146" url="?curid=1102451" title="Pinball Illusions">
<text>Pinball Illusions is an Amiga and MS-DOS pinball video game developed by Digital Illusions CE (DICE) in 1995 as a sequel of &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; and &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;.

The original Amiga release featured three tables. The PC CD version added a fourth, &quot;The Vikings&quot; (this was written for the Amiga version but not considered good enough for inclusion). This was the first version of the series to feature more than 1 ball in play at a time (known as &#x27;multiball&#x27;), and the first to be released for AGA based Amigas. The game also marks its nationality as a Swedish product in &quot;The Vikings&quot; table (at the top left corner).

The game was ranked the 23rd best game of all time by &quot;Amiga Power&quot; in 1996. &quot;Maximum&quot; scored the PC version three out of five stars. They said the four tables are &quot;all excellent in their own way&quot; but that the game lacks the imagination and innovation of other pinball video games. They concluded it to be &quot;solid, if uninspiring, entertainment.&quot;

Digital Illusions used the four tables from this game to produce &quot;True Pinball&quot; on the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation, which presented the tables in a more realistic perspective.

==Pinball World==
&quot;Pinball World&quot; was released on DOS just after &quot;Pinball Illusions&quot;. It has nine pinball tables: Africa, Australia, Far East, Germany, Hollywood, United Kingdom, New York, North Pole, and South America. It was developed and written by Spidersoft. Coming Soon Magazine gave it 90 out of 100, PC Joker gave it 68 out of 100, PC Player (Germany) gave it 68 out of 100, Power Play gave it 57 out of 100, Joystick (French) gave it 50 out of 100, PC Games (Germany) gave it 45 out of 100, Computer Gaming World (CGW) gave it 2 Stars, and High Score gave it 1 out of 5.

<text>Gabrielle Ray (born Gabrielle Elizabeth Clifford Cook, 28 April 1883 – 21 May 1973) was an English stage actress, dancer and singer, best known for her roles in Edwardian musical comedies.

Ray was considered one of the most beautiful actresses on the London stage and became one of the most photographed women in the world. In the first decade of the 20th century, she had a good career in musical theatre. After an unsuccessful marriage, she returned to the stage, but she never recovered the fame that she had enjoyed. She later struggled with depression and spent her last 37 years in a mental hospital.

== Biography==
Ray was born in Cheadle, Stockport, England. She was the fourth child of William Austin Cook, a prosperous iron merchant and a Justice of the Peace for Cheshire, and his wife Anne Maria Elizabeth &quot;née&quot; Holden.

===Early career===
Known as &#x27;Gabs&#x27; to family and friends, Ray first appeared in London&#x27;s West End at the age of ten in the role of Eveleen in John Hollingshead&#x27;s production of a musical play called &quot;Miami&quot; at the Royal Princess&#x27;s Theatre. This was followed by juvenile roles in a series of plays in London and on tour. The next year, she played a role in &quot;A Celebrated Case&quot;. She was also a dancer in the Blackpool ballet. At the Richmond Theatre from 1893, she played Cupid in &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, Adrienne in &quot;Proof&quot;, and Cissie in &quot;The Silver King&quot;, among other plays and pantomimes. In 1899, she appeared in &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; at the Hammersmith Lyric Opera House. Manager Ben Greet noticed her dancing skills and engaged her to tour with his company. With Greet, she toured for three years in the roles of Mamie Clancy in &quot;The Belle of New York&quot; and Dolly Twinkle in &quot;The Casino Girl&quot; (1901). Ray was back at the Lyric in 1902 to play the title character in the pantomime &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.
During the first decade of the 20th century, Ray&#x27;s career had progressed to the point where she was performing at leading West End venues and gaining attention as a beautiful young dancer and actress. Her photograph was much sought after by the various trade publications and leading photographers such of the day. Known across Europe for her looks, she was admired by men such as Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt and King Manuel of Portugal.

George Edwardes hired Ray to understudy Gertie Millar in &quot;The Toreador&quot; at the Gaiety Theatre, London, in 1902, where she had the chance to play the role on many occasions. She then took over for Letty Lind in &quot;The Girl from Kays&quot; at the Apollo Theatre, earning good notices for her graceful, acrobatic dancing in particular. Next, she earned considerable fame playing Thisbe in the hit musical &quot;The Orchid&quot; (1903), where she danced in pink pyjamas while singing &quot;The Pink Pyjama Girl&quot;. She continued to appear in Edwardes&#x27; productions in 1905 and 1906, including three successes at the Prince of Wales Theatre: &quot;Lady Madcap&quot; (1905, in which she performed a popular Parisian dance, &quot;La Maxixe&quot;), Lady Dorothy Congress in &quot;The Little Cherub&quot; (1906) and So-Hie in &quot;See See&quot; (1906). The same year she also played Eglé in &quot;The Merveilleuses&quot;. In 1907, Ray played Frou Frou in Edwardes&#x27; adaptation of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, which ran for 778 performances at Daly&#x27;s Theatre. Ray&#x27;s dance number, complete with handstands and high kicks, all performed on a table at Maxim&#x27;s held head high by four men, was a show stopper. Next she was Daisy in &quot;The Dollar Princess&quot; (1909) at Daly&#x27;s and Polly in &quot;Peggy&quot; (1911) at the Gaiety.

===Marriage and later years===
Ray announced her retirement to marry the wealthy Eric Raymond Loder (1888–1966) in early 1912 and left the production of &quot;Peggy&quot;. She did not appear at the well-attended scheduled wedding ceremony at St Edwards Roman Catholic Church in Windsor because of Loder&#x27;s failure to sign the prenuptial contract that guaranteed her financial security, but he claimed it was an oversight, and the marriage took place three days later. In 1913 Loder committed adultery and deserted Ray, ignoring her letters pleading with him to return to her. She filed for restitution of conjugal rights, but Loder did not respond to the legal order, and the couple divorced in 1914.

The broken marriage was difficult for Ray, but in 1915 she returned to the stage to play the role of Estelle in the musical &quot;Betty&quot; at the Gaiety Theatre and, in the following year, appeared in the revue &quot;Flying Colours&quot; at the London Hippodrome. These were her last appearances in the West End, but for nearly a decade afterwards, she appeared occasionally in provincial variety tours and pantomimes, finally leaving the stage about 1924. Roles during this decade included Maid Marian in &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot; at Prince&#x27;s Theatre in Bradford at Christmas 1919 and Mother Goose at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, at Christmas 1920.

After this, Ray struggled with depression and alcohol abuse. In 1936 she suffered a mental breakdown and was institutionalised for 37 years at Holloway Sanatorium in Egham, Surrey. In 1939 she was listed there as &quot;Incapacitated&quot;. Registered as Mrs Eric Loder, at least part of her long stay at the sanatorium was happy. Ray continued to care for her personal appearance, having a liking for smart clothes and hats. Other Gaiety Girls visited her, including Gertie Millar and Lily Elsie, but she was never visited by family members. Hospital staff later recalled her infectious smile and that she enjoyed walks into the nearby village for shopping and car rides. After her death one of her nurses said, &quot;she was a very quiet lady, small and neat, who did not give any indication of the high life she must have enjoyed&quot;.

Ray died in 1973 at the Holloway Sanatorium at the age of 90 and was buried in Englefield Green cemetery. In her will she left £17,441. A blue plaque has been erected on the site of her birth.

<text>The three-legged (or [[tripedalism|tripedal]]) crow is a mythological creature in various mythologies and arts of East Asia. It is believed to inhabit and represent the Sun.

Evidence of the earliest bird-Sun motif or totemic articles excavated around 5000 BCE at China. This bird-Sun totem heritage was observed in later Yangshao and Longshan cultures. Also, in Northeast Asia, artifacts of birds and phoenix observed to be a symbol of leadership was excavated to be around 5500 BCE in Xinle culture and later Hongshan culture from Liao river basin.

The Chinese have several versions of crow and crow-Sun tales. But the most popular depiction and myth of the Sun crow is that of the Yangwu or Jinwu, the &quot;golden crow&quot;. It has also been found figured on ancient coins from Lycia and Pamphylia.

==China==

In Chinese mythology and culture, the three-legged crow is called the sanzuwu (; Cantonese: &quot;saam1zuk1wu1&quot;; Shanghainese: sae tsoh u) and is present in many myths. It is also mentioned in the Shanhaijing. The earliest known depiction of a three-legged crow appears in Neolithic pottery of the Yangshao culture. 
The sanzuwu in a disc represents the sun and is also one of the &quot;Twelve Ornaments&quot; that is used in the decoration of formal imperial garments in ancient China.

===Sun crow in Chinese mythology===
The most popular depiction and myth of a &quot;sanzuwu&quot; is of a sun crow called the Yangwu (), more commonly referred to as the Jinwu () or &quot;golden crow&quot;. Even though it is described as a corvid, it is usually coloured red instead of black. A silk painting from the Western Han excavated at the Mawangdui archaeological site also depicts a &quot;golden crow&quot; in the sun.
In ancient Chinese depictions, the Chinese god of creation, Fuxi, is often depicted carrying the sun disk with the while the Chinese goddess of creation, Nüwa, holds the moon disk which contains a gold-striped toad.

According to folklore, there were originally ten sun crows which settled in 10 separate suns. They perched on a red mulberry tree called the Fusang, literally meaning &quot;the leaning mulberry tree&quot;, in the East at the foot of the Valley of the Sun. This mulberry tree was said to have many mouths opening from its branches. Each day one of the sun crows would be rostered to travel around the world on a carriage, driven by Xihe, the &#x27;mother&#x27; of the suns. As soon as one sun crow returned, another one would set forth in its journey crossing the sky. According to the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;, the sun crows loved eating two grasses of immortality, one called the Diri (), and the other the Chunsheng (. The sun crows would often descend from heaven on to the earth and feast on these grasses, but Xihe did not like this; thus, she covered their eyes to prevent them from doing so. Folklore also held that, at around 2170 BC, all ten sun crows came out on the same day, causing the world to burn; Hou Yi, the celestial archer, saved the day by shooting down all but one of the sun crows.

The &quot;sanzuwu&quot; is also depicted with the Queen Mother of the West who are believed to be her messengers.

===Other tripedal creatures in Chinese mythology===
In Chinese mythology, there are other three-legged creatures besides the crow, for instance, the &quot;yu&quot; &quot;a three-legged tortoise that causes malaria&quot;.

The three-legged crow symbolizing the sun has a yin yang counterpart in the &quot;chánchú&quot; &quot;three-legged toad&quot; symbolizing the moon (along with the moon rabbit). According to an ancient tradition, this toad is the transformed Chang&#x27;e lunar deity who stole the elixir of life from her husband Houyi the archer, and fled to the moon where she was turned into a toad.

The &quot;Fènghuáng&quot; is commonly depicted as being two-legged but there are some instances in art in which it has a three-legged appearance.

Xi Wangmu (Queen Mother of the West) is also said to have three green birds () that gathered food for her and in Han-period religious art they were depicted as having three legs. In the Yongtai Tomb dating to the Tang dynasty Era, when the Cult of Xi Wangu flourished, the birds are also shown as being three-legged.

==Japan==
In Japanese mythology, this flying creature is a raven or a jungle crow called Yatagarasu and the appearance of the great bird is construed as evidence of the will of Heaven or divine intervention in human affairs.

Although Yatagarasu is mentioned in a number of places in Shintō, the depictions are primarily seen on Edo wood art, dating back to the early 1800s wood-art era. Although not as celebrated today, the crow is a mark of rebirth and rejuvenation; the animal that has historically cleaned up after great battles symbolized the renaissance after such tragedy.

Yatagarasu as a crow-god is a symbol specifically of guidance. This great crow was sent from heaven as a guide for legendary Emperor Jimmu on his initial journey from the region which would become Kumano to what would become Yamato, (Yoshino and then Kashihara). It is generally accepted that Yatagarasu is an incarnation of Kamotaketsunumi no Mikoto, but none of the early surviving documentary records are quite so specific. 
In more than one instance, Yatagarasu appears as a three legged crow not in &quot;Kojiki&quot; but in &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot;.

Both the Japan Football Association and subsequently its administered teams such as the Japan national football team use the symbol of Yatagarasu in their emblems and badges respectively. The winner of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup is also given the honor of wearing the Yatagarasu emblem the following season.

Although the Yatagarasu is commonly perceived as a three-legged crow, there is in fact no mention of it being such in the original &quot;Kojiki&quot;. Consequently, it is theorised that this is a result of a later possible misinterpretation during the Heian period that the Yatagarasu and the Chinese &quot;Yangwu&quot; refer to an identical entity.

==Korea==
In Korean mythology, it is known as Samjok-o ( – literally &quot;three-legged crow&quot;). During the Goguryeo period, the ancient Korean people thought the Samjok-o to be a symbol of the sun and of great power, often representing the Taewang () and Goguryeo&#x27;s sovereignty. It was also believed that the three-legged crow lived in the sun while a toad lived in the moon. The Samjok-o is such a highly respected symbol of power, even superior to both the dragon and the Korean bonghwang, that it carried into Silla, Goryeo, Joseon, and modern Korea.

Samjok-o appeared in the story Yeonorang Seonyeo. A couple, Yeono and Seo, lived on the beach of the East Sea in 157 (King Adalala 4), and rode to Japan on a moving rock. The Japanese took two people to Japan as kings and noblemen. At that time, the light of the sun and the moon disappeared in Silla. King Adalala sent an official to Japan to return the couple, but Yeono said to take the silk that was made by his wife, Seo, and sacrifice it to the sky. As he said this, the sun and moon were brighter again.

In modern Korea, Samjok-o is still found especially in dramas such as &quot;Jumong&quot;. The three-legged crow was one of several emblems under consideration to replace the &quot;bonghwang&quot; in the Korean seal of state when its revision was considered in 2008. The Samjok-o appears also in Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC&#x27;s current emblem. There are some Korean companies using Samjok-o as their corporate logos.

<text>The Wire is an American crime drama television series created and primarily written by American author and former police reporter David Simon for the cable network HBO. The series premiered on June 2, 2002, and ended on March 9, 2008, comprising 60 episodes over five seasons. The idea for the show started out as a police drama loosely based on the experiences of Simon&#x27;s writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher.

Set and produced in Baltimore, Maryland, &quot;The Wire&quot; introduces a different institution of the city and its relationship to law enforcement in each season while retaining characters and advancing storylines from previous seasons. The five subjects are, in chronological order; the illegal drug trade, the port system, the city government and bureaucracy, education and schools, and the print news medium. Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his familiarity with the city.

When the series first aired, the large cast consisted mainly of actors who were unknown to television audiences, as well as numerous real-life Baltimore and Maryland figures in guest and recurring roles. Simon has said that despite its framing as a crime drama, the show is &quot;really about the American city, and about how we live together. It&#x27;s about how institutions have an effect on individuals. Whether one is a cop, a longshoreman, a drug dealer, a politician, a judge or a lawyer, all are ultimately compromised and must contend with whatever institution to which they are committed.&quot;

&quot;The Wire&quot; is lauded for its literary themes and its uncommonly accurate exploration of society, politics and urban life. Despite this, the series received only average ratings and never won any major television awards during its original run, but it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time.

== Production ==

=== Conception ===
Simon has stated that he originally set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective and public school teacher who had worked with Simon on projects including &quot;The Corner&quot; (2000). Burns, when working on protracted investigations of violent drug dealers using surveillance technology, had often been frustrated by the bureaucracy of the Baltimore Police Department; Simon saw similarities with his own ordeals as a police reporter for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;.

Simon chose to set the show in Baltimore because of his familiarity with the city. During his time as a writer and producer for the NBC program &quot;&quot;, based on his book &quot;&quot; (1991), also set in Baltimore, Simon had come into conflict with NBC network executives who were displeased by the show&#x27;s pessimism. Simon wanted to avoid a repeat of these conflicts and chose to take &quot;The Wire&quot; to HBO, because of their working relationship from the miniseries &quot;The Corner&quot;. HBO was initially doubtful about including a police drama in its lineup but agreed to produce the pilot episode. Simon approached the mayor of Baltimore, telling him that he wanted to give a bleak portrayal of certain aspects of the city; Simon was welcomed to work there again. He hoped the show would change the opinions of some viewers but said that it was unlikely to affect the issues it portrays.

=== Casting ===
The casting of the show has been praised for avoiding big-name stars and using character actors who appear natural in their roles. The looks of the cast as a whole have been described as defying TV expectations by presenting a true range of humanity on screen. 

Wendell Pierce, who plays Detective Bunk Moreland, was the first actor to be cast. Dominic West, who won the ostensible lead role of Detective Jimmy McNulty, sent in a tape he recorded the night before the audition&#x27;s deadline of his playing out a scene by himself. Lance Reddick received the role of Cedric Daniels after auditioning for the roles of Bunk and heroin addict Bubbles. Michael K. Williams got the part of Omar Little after only a single audition. Williams himself recommended Felicia Pearson for the role of Snoop after meeting her at a local Baltimore bar, shortly after she had served prison time for a second degree murder conviction.

Several prominent real-life Baltimore figures, including former Maryland Governor Robert L. Ehrlich Jr.; Rev. Frank M. Reid III; radio personality Marc Steiner; former police chief and radio personality Ed Norris; &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter and editor David Ettlin; Howard County Executive Ken Ulman; and former mayor Kurt Schmoke have appeared in minor roles despite not being professional actors.

&quot;Little Melvin&quot; Williams, a Baltimore drug lord arrested in the 1980s by an investigation that Burns had been part of, had a recurring role as a deacon beginning in the third season. Jay Landsman, a longtime police officer who inspired the character of the same name, played Lieutenant Dennis Mello. Baltimore police commander Gary D&#x27;Addario served as the series&#x27; technical advisor for the first two seasons and had a recurring role as prosecutor Gary DiPasquale. Simon shadowed D&#x27;Addario&#x27;s shift when researching his book &quot;Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets&quot; and both D&#x27;Addario and Landsman are subjects of the book.

More than a dozen cast members previously appeared on HBO&#x27;s first hour-long drama &quot;Oz&quot;. J. D. Williams, Seth Gilliam, Lance Reddick, and Reg E. Cathey were featured in very prominent roles on &quot;Oz&quot;, while a number of other notable stars of &quot;The Wire&quot;, including Wood Harris, Frankie Faison, John Doman, Clarke Peters, Domenick Lombardozzi, Michael Hyatt, Michael Potts, and Method Man, appeared in at least one episode of &quot;Oz&quot;. Cast members Erik Dellums, Peter Gerety, Clark Johnson, Clayton LeBouef, Toni Lewis and Callie Thorne also appeared on &quot;&quot;, the earlier and award-winning network television series also based on Simon&#x27;s book; Lewis appeared on &quot;Oz&quot; as well. A number of cast members, as well as crew members, also appeared in the preceding HBO miniseries &quot;The Corner&quot; including Clarke Peters, Reg E. Cathey, Lance Reddick, Corey Parker Robinson, Robert F. Chew, Delaney Williams, and Benay Berger.

=== Crew ===
Alongside Simon, the show&#x27;s creator, head writer, showrunner, and executive producer, much of the creative team behind &quot;The Wire&quot; were alumni of &quot;&quot; and Primetime Emmy Award-winning miniseries &quot;The Corner&quot;. &quot;The Corner&quot; veteran, Robert F. Colesberry, was executive producer for the first two seasons and directed the season 2 finale before dying from complications from heart surgery in 2004. He is credited by the rest of the creative team as having a large creative role as a producer, and Simon credits him for achieving the show&#x27;s realistic visual feel. He also had a small recurring role as Detective Ray Cole. Colesberry&#x27;s wife Karen L. Thorson joined him on the production staff. A third producer on &quot;The Corner&quot;, Nina Kostroff Noble also stayed with the production staff for &quot;The Wire&quot; rounding out the initial four-person team. Following Colesberry&#x27;s death, she became the show&#x27;s second executive producer alongside Simon.

Stories for the show were often co-written by Burns, who also became a producer in the show&#x27;s fourth season. Other writers include three acclaimed crime fiction writers from outside of Baltimore: George Pelecanos from Washington, Richard Price from the Bronx and Dennis Lehane from Boston. Reviewers drew comparisons between Price&#x27;s works (particularly &quot;Clockers&quot;) and &quot;The Wire&quot; even before he joined. In addition to writing, Pelecanos served as a producer for the third season. Pelecanos has commented that he was attracted to the project because of the opportunity to work with Simon.

Staff writer Rafael Alvarez penned several episodes&#x27; scripts, as well as the series guidebook &quot;The Wire: Truth Be Told.&quot; Alvarez is a colleague of Simon&#x27;s from &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and a Baltimore native with working experience in the port area. Another city native and independent filmmaker, Joy Lusco, also wrote for the show in each of its first three seasons. &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; writer and political journalist William F. Zorzi joined the writing staff in the third season and brought a wealth of experience to the show&#x27;s examination of Baltimore politics.

Playwright and television writer/producer Eric Overmyer joined the crew of &quot;The Wire&quot; in the show&#x27;s fourth season as a consulting producer and writer. He had also previously worked on &quot;Homicide&quot;. Overmyer was brought into the full-time production staff to replace Pelecanos who scaled back his involvement to concentrate on his next book and worked on the fourth season solely as a writer. Primetime Emmy Award winner, &quot;Homicide&quot; and &quot;The Corner&quot;, writer and college friend of Simon, David Mills also joined the writing staff in the fourth season.

Directors include &quot;Homicide&quot; alumnus Clark Johnson, who directed several acclaimed episodes of &quot;The Shield&quot;, and Tim Van Patten, a Primetime Emmy Award winner who has worked on every season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. The directing has been praised for its uncomplicated and subtle style. Following the death of Colesberry, director Joe Chappelle joined the production staff as a co-executive producer and continued to regularly direct episodes.

=== Episode structure ===

Each episode begins with a cold open that seldom contains a dramatic juncture. The screen then fades or cuts to black while the intro music fades in. The show&#x27;s opening title sequence then plays; a series of shots, mainly close-ups, concerning the show&#x27;s subject matter that changes from season to season, separated by fast cutting (a technique rarely used in the show itself). The opening credits are superimposed on the sequence, and consist only of actors&#x27; names without identifying which actors play which roles. In addition, actors&#x27; faces are rarely seen in the title sequence.

At the end of the sequence, a quotation (epigraph) is shown on-screen that is spoken by a character during the episode. The three exceptions were the first season finale which uses the phrase &quot;All in the game&quot;, attributed to &quot;Traditional West Baltimore&quot;, a phrase used frequently throughout all five seasons including that episode; the fourth season finale which uses the words &quot;If animal trapped call 410-844-6286&quot; written on boarded up vacant homes attributed to &quot;Baltimore, traditional&quot; and the series finale, which started with a quote from H. L. Mencken that is shown on a wall at &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; in one scene, neither quote being spoken by a character. Progressive story arcs often unfold in different locations at the same time. Episodes rarely end with a cliffhanger, and close with a fade or cut to black with the closing music fading in.

When broadcast on HBO and on some international networks, the episodes are preceded by a recap of events that have a bearing upon the upcoming narrative, using clips from previous episodes.

=== Music ===
Rather than overlaying songs on the soundtrack, or employing a score, &quot;The Wire&quot; primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a jukebox or car radio. This kind of music is known as &quot;diegetic&quot; or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.

The opening theme is &quot;Way Down in the Hole,&quot; a gospel-and-blues-inspired song, written by Tom Waits for his 1987 album &quot;Franks Wild Years&quot;. Each season uses a different recording and a different opening sequence, with the theme being performed by The Blind Boys of Alabama, Waits, The Neville Brothers, DoMaJe and Steve Earle. The season four version of &quot;Way Down in the Hole&quot; was arranged and recorded for the show and is performed by five Baltimore teenagers: Ivan Ashford, Markel Steele, Cameron Brown, Tariq Al-Sabir and Avery Bargasse. Earle, who performed the fifth season version, is also a member of the cast, playing the recovering drug addict Walon. The closing theme is &quot;The Fall,&quot; composed by Blake Leyh, who is also the music supervisor of the show.

During season finales, a song is played before the closing scene in a montage showing the lives of the protagonists in the aftermath of the narrative. The first season montage is played over &quot;Step by Step&quot; by Jesse Winchester, the second &quot;I Feel Alright&quot; by Steve Earle, the third &quot;Fast Train&quot; written by Van Morrison and performed by Solomon Burke, the fourth &quot;I Walk on Gilded Splinters&quot; written by Dr. John and performed by Paul Weller and the fifth uses an extended version of &quot;Way Down In The Hole&quot; by the Blind Boys of Alabama, the same version of the song used as the opening theme for the first season.

While the songs reflect the mood of the sequence, their lyrics are usually only loosely tied to the visual shots. In the commentary track to episode 37, &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;, executive producer David Simon said: &quot;I hate it when somebody purposely tries to have the lyrics match the visual. It brutalizes the visual in a way to have the lyrics dead on point. ... Yet at the same time it can&#x27;t be totally off point. It has to glance at what you&#x27;re trying to say.&quot;

Two soundtrack albums, called &quot;The Wire: And All the Pieces Matter—Five Years of Music from The Wire&quot; and &quot;Beyond Hamsterdam&quot;, were released on January 8, 2008, on Nonesuch Records. The former features music from all five seasons of the series and the latter includes local Baltimore artists exclusively.

== Style ==

=== Realism ===
The writers strove to create a realistic vision of an American city based on their own experiences. Simon, originally a reporter for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, spent a year researching a Baltimore homicide detective unit for his book &quot;&quot;, where he met Burns. Burns served in the Baltimore Police Department for 20 years and later became a teacher in an inner-city school. The two of them spent a year researching the drug culture and poverty in Baltimore for their book &quot;The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood&quot;. Their combined experiences were used in many storylines of &quot;The Wire&quot;.

Central to the show&#x27;s aim for realism was the creation of truthful characters. Simon has stated that most of them are composites of real-life Baltimore figures. For instance, Donnie Andrews served as the main inspiration of Omar Little. Martin O&#x27;Malley served as &quot;one of the inspirations&quot; for Tommy Carcetti. The show often cast non-professional actors in minor roles, distinguishing itself from other television series by showing the &quot;faces and voices of the real city&quot; it depicts. The writing also uses contemporary slang to enhance the immersive viewing experience.

In distinguishing the police characters from other television detectives, Simon makes the point that even the best police of &quot;The Wire&quot; are motivated not by a desire to protect and serve, but by the intellectual vanity of believing they are smarter than the criminals they are chasing. While many of the police do exhibit altruistic qualities, many officers portrayed on the show are incompetent, brutal, self-aggrandizing, or hamstrung by bureaucracy and politics. The criminals are not always motivated by profit or a desire to harm others; many are trapped in their existence and all have human qualities. Even so, &quot;The Wire&quot; does not minimize or gloss over the horrific effects of their actions.

The show is realistic in depicting the processes of both police work and criminal activity. There have even been reports of real-life criminals watching the show to learn how to counter police investigation techniques. The fifth season portrayed a working newsroom at &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and was described by Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; magazine in 2007 as the most realistic portrayal of the media in film and television.

In a December 2006 &quot;Washington Post&quot; article, local black students said that the show had &quot;hit a nerve&quot; with the black community and that they themselves knew real-life counterparts of many of the characters. The article expressed great sadness at the toll drugs and violence are taking on the black community.

=== Visual novel ===
Many important events occur off-camera and there is no artificial exposition in the form of voice-over or flashbacks, with the exceptions of two flashbacks – one at the end of the pilot episode that replays a moment from earlier in the same episode and one at the end of the fourth season finale that shows a short clip of a character tutoring his younger brother earlier in the season. Thus, the viewer needs to follow every conversation closely to understand the ongoing story arc and the relevance of each character to it. &quot;Salon&quot; has described the show as novelistic in structure, with a greater depth of writing and plotting than other crime shows.

Each season of &quot;The Wire&quot; consists of 10 to 13 episodes that form several multi-layered narratives. Simon chose this structure with an eye towards long story arcs that draw in viewers, resulting in a more satisfying payoff. He uses the metaphor of a visual novel in several interviews, describing each episode as a chapter, and has also commented that this allows a fuller exploration of the show&#x27;s themes in time not spent on plot development.

=== Social commentary ===
Simon described the second season as &quot;a meditation on the death of work and the betrayal of the American working class ... it is a deliberate argument that unencumbered capitalism is not a substitute for social policy; that on its own, without a social compact, raw capitalism is destined to serve the few at the expense of the many.&quot; He added that season 3 &quot;reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals.&quot; The third season is also an allegory that draws explicit parallels between the Iraq War and drug prohibition, which in Simon&#x27;s view has failed in its aims and has become a war against America&#x27;s underclass. This is portrayed by Major Colvin, imparting to Carver his view that policing has been allowed to become a war and thus will never succeed in its aims.

Writer Ed Burns, who worked as a public school teacher after retiring from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show&#x27;s criminal characters and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.

== Themes ==

=== Institutional dysfunction ===
Simon has identified the organizations featured in the show—the Baltimore Police Department, City Hall, the Baltimore public school system, the Barksdale drug trafficking operation, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and the stevedores&#x27; union—as comparable institutions. All are dysfunctional in some way, and the characters are typically betrayed by the institutions that they accept in their lives. There is also a sentiment echoed by a detective in Narcotics—&quot;Shit rolls downhill&quot;—which describes how superiors, especially in the higher tiers of the Police Department in the series, will attempt to use subordinates as scapegoats for any major scandals. Simon described the show as &quot;cynical about institutions&quot; while taking a humanistic approach toward its characters.
A central theme developed throughout the show is the struggle between individual desires and subordination to the group&#x27;s goals.

=== Surveillance ===
Central to the structure and plot of the show is the use of electronic surveillance and wiretap technologies by the police—hence the title &quot;The Wire.&quot; &quot;Salon&quot; described the title as a metaphor for the viewer&#x27;s experience: the wiretaps provide the police with access to a secret world, just as the show does for the viewer. Simon has discussed the use of camera shots of surveillance equipment, or shots that appear to be taken from the equipment itself, to emphasize the volume of surveillance in modern life and the characters&#x27; need to sift through this information.

== Cast and characters ==
&quot;The Wire&quot; employs a broad ensemble cast, supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions featured on the show. The majority of the cast is black, which accurately reflects the demographics of Baltimore.

The show&#x27;s creators are also willing to kill off major characters, so that viewers cannot assume that a given character will survive simply because of a starring role or popularity among fans. In response to a question on why a certain character had to die, David Simon said,

We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. &quot;The Wire&quot; is making an argument about what institutions—bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even—do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I&#x27;m afraid, a somewhat angry show.

=== Main cast ===
The major characters of the first season were divided between those on the side of the law and those involved in drug-related crime. The investigating detail was launched by the actions of Detective Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), whose insubordinate tendencies and personal problems played counterpoint to his ability as a criminal investigator. The detail was led by Lieutenant Cedric Daniels (Lance Reddick) who faced challenges balancing his career aspirations with his desire to produce a good case. Kima Greggs (Sonja Sohn) was a capable lead detective who faced jealousy from colleagues and worry about the dangers of her job from her domestic partner. Her investigative work was greatly helped by her confidential informant, a drug addict known as Bubbles (Andre Royo).

Like Greggs, partners Thomas &quot;Herc&quot; Hauk (Domenick Lombardozzi) and Ellis Carver (Seth Gilliam) were reassigned to the detail from the narcotics unit. The duo&#x27;s initially violent nature was eventually subdued as they proved useful in grunt work, and sometimes served as comic relief for the viewer. Rounding out the temporary unit were detectives Lester Freamon (Clarke Peters) and Roland &quot;Prez&quot; Pryzbylewski (Jim True-Frost). Freamon, seen as a quiet &quot;house cat&quot;, soon proved to be one of the unit&#x27;s most methodical and experienced investigators, with a knack for noticing important details and a deep knowledge of public records and paper trails. Prez faced sanction early on and was forced into office duty, but this setback quickly became a boon as he demonstrated natural skill at deciphering the communication codes used by the Barksdale organization.

These investigators were overseen by two commanding officers more concerned with politics and their own careers than the case, Deputy Commissioner Ervin Burrell (Frankie Faison) and Major William Rawls (John Doman). Assistant state&#x27;s attorney Rhonda Pearlman (Deirdre Lovejoy) acted as the legal liaison between the detail and the courthouse and also had a sexual relationship with McNulty. In the homicide division, Bunk Moreland (Wendell Pierce) was a gifted, dry-witted, hard-drinking detective partnered with McNulty under Sergeant Jay Landsman (Delaney Williams), the sarcastic, sharp-tongued squad supervisor. Peter Gerety had a recurring role as Judge Phelan, the official who started the case moving.

On the other side of the investigation was Avon Barksdale&#x27;s drug empire. The driven, ruthless Barksdale (Wood Harris) was aided by business-minded Stringer Bell (Idris Elba). Avon&#x27;s nephew D&#x27;Angelo Barksdale (Larry Gilliard Jr.) ran some of his uncle&#x27;s territory, but also possessed a guilty conscience, while loyal Wee-Bey Brice (Hassan Johnson) was responsible for multiple homicides carried out on Avon&#x27;s orders. Working under D&#x27;Angelo were Poot (Tray Chaney), Bodie (J. D. Williams), and Wallace (Michael B. Jordan), all street-level drug dealers. Wallace was an intelligent but naive youth trapped in the drug trade, and Poot a randy young man happy to follow rather than lead. Omar Little (Michael K. Williams), a renowned Baltimore stick-up man robbing drug dealers for a living, was a frequent thorn in the side of the Barksdale clan.

The second season introduced a new group of characters working in the Port of Baltimore area, including Spiros &quot;Vondas&quot; Vondopoulos (Paul Ben-Victor), Beadie Russell (Amy Ryan), and Frank Sobotka (Chris Bauer). Vondas was the underboss of a global smuggling operation, Russell an inexperienced port authority officer and single mother thrown in at the deep end of a multiple homicide investigation, and Frank Sobotka a union leader who turned to crime to raise funds to save his union. Also joining the show in season 2 were Nick Sobotka (Pablo Schreiber), Frank&#x27;s nephew; Ziggy Sobotka (James Ransone), Frank&#x27;s troubled son; and &quot;The Greek&quot; (Bill Raymond), Vondas&#x27; mysterious boss. As the second season ended, the focus shifted away from the ports, leaving the new characters behind.

The third season saw several previously recurring characters assuming larger starring roles, including Detective Leander Sydnor (Corey Parker Robinson), Bodie (J.D. Williams), Omar (Michael K. Williams), Proposition Joe (Robert F. Chew), and Major Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin (Robert Wisdom). Colvin commanded the Western district where the Barksdale organization operated, and nearing retirement, he came up with a radical new method of dealing with the drug problem. Proposition Joe, the East Side&#x27;s cautious drug kingpin, became more cooperative with the Barksdale Organization. Sydnor, a rising young star in the Police Department in season 1, returned to the cast as part of the major crimes unit. Bodie had been seen gradually rising in the Barksdale organization since the first episode; he was born to their trade and showed a fierce aptitude for it. Omar had a vendetta against the Barksdale organization and gave them all of his lethal attention.

New additions in the third season included Tommy Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), an ambitious city councilman; Mayor Clarence Royce (Glynn Turman), the incumbent whom Carcetti planned to unseat; Marlo Stanfield (Jamie Hector), leader of an upstart gang seeking to challenge Avon&#x27;s dominance; and Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise (Chad Coleman), a newly released convict uncertain of his future.

In the fourth season, four young actors joined the cast: Jermaine Crawford as Duquan &quot;Dukie&quot; Weems; Maestro Harrell as Randy Wagstaff; Julito McCullum as Namond Brice; and Tristan Wilds as Michael Lee. The characters are friends from a west Baltimore middle school. Another newcomer was Norman Wilson (Reg E. Cathey), Carcetti&#x27;s deputy campaign manager.

The fifth season saw several actors join the starring cast. Gbenga Akinnagbe returns as the previously recurring Chris Partlow, chief enforcer of the now dominant Stanfield Organization. Neal Huff reprises his role as mayoral chief of staff Michael Steintorf, having previously appeared as a guest star at the end of the fourth season. Two other actors also joined the starring cast, having previously portrayed their corrupt characters as guest stars—Michael Kostroff as defense attorney Maurice Levy and Isiah Whitlock Jr. as State Senator Clay Davis. Crew member Clark Johnson appeared in front of the camera for the first time in the series to play Augustus Haynes, the principled editor of the city desk of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;. He is joined in the newsroom by two other new stars; Michelle Paress and Tom McCarthy play young reporters Alma Gutierrez and Scott Templeton.

== Episodes ==

=== Season 1 (2002) ===
The first season introduces two major groups of characters: the Baltimore Police Department and a drug dealing organization run by the Barksdale family. The season follows the police investigation of the latter over its 13 episodes.

The investigation is triggered when, following the acquittal of D&#x27;Angelo Barksdale for murder after a key witness changes her story, Detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with Judge Daniel Phelan. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness has probably been intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s uncle, Avon Barksdale, having recognized several faces at the trial, most notably Avon&#x27;s second-in-command, Stringer Bell. He also tells Phelan that no one is investigating Barksdale&#x27;s criminal activity, which includes a significant portion of the city&#x27;s drug trade and several unsolved homicides.

Phelan reacts to McNulty&#x27;s report by complaining to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, owing to the department&#x27;s dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail&#x27;s commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the two opposing groups of police.

Meanwhile, the organized and cautious Barksdale gang is explored through characters at various levels within it. The organization is continually antagonized by a stick-up crew led by Omar Little, and the feud leads to several deaths. Throughout, D&#x27;Angelo struggles with his conscience over his life of crime and the people it affects.

The police have little success with street-level arrests or with securing informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes the direction of electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions.

When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is seriously hurt in the operation, triggering an overzealous response from the rest of the department. This causes the detail&#x27;s targets to suspect that they are under investigation.

Wallace is murdered by his childhood friends Bodie and Poot, on orders from Stringer Bell, after leaving his &quot;secure&quot; placement with relatives and returning to Baltimore. D&#x27;Angelo Barksdale is eventually arrested transporting a kilo of uncut heroin, and learning of Wallace&#x27;s murder, is ready to turn in his uncle and Stringer. However, D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s mother convinces him to rescind the deal and take the charges for his family. The detail manages to arrest Avon on a minor charge and gets one of his soldiers, Wee-Bey, to confess to most of the murders, some of which he did not commit. Stringer escapes prosecution and is left running the Barksdale empire. For the officers, the consequences of antagonizing their superiors are severe, with Daniels passed over for promotion and McNulty assigned out of homicide and into the marine unit.

=== Season 2 (2003) ===
The second season, along with its ongoing examination of the drug problem and its effect on the urban poor, examines the plight of the blue-collar urban working class as exemplified by dockworkers in the city port, as some of them get caught up in smuggling drugs and other contraband inside the shipping containers that pass through their port. In a season-long subplot, the Barksdale organization continues its drug trafficking despite Avon&#x27;s imprisonment, with Stringer Bell assuming greater power.

McNulty harbors a grudge against his former commanders for reassigning him to the marine unit. When thirteen unidentified young women are found dead in a container at the docks, McNulty successfully makes a spiteful effort to place the murders within the jurisdiction of his former commander. Meanwhile, police Major Stan Valchek gets into a feud with Polish-American Frank Sobotka, a leader of the International Brotherhood of Stevedores, a fictional dockers&#x27; union, over competing donations to their old neighborhood church. Valchek demands a detail to investigate Sobotka. A detail is assigned, but staffed with &quot;humps&quot;.

Valcheck threatens Burrell with a disruption of Burrell&#x27;s confirmation hearings and insists on Daniels. Cedric Daniels is interviewed, having been praised by Prez, Major Valchek&#x27;s son-in-law, and also because of his work on the Barksdale case. He is eventually selected to lead the detail assigned just to investigate Sobotka; when the investigation is concluded Daniels is assured he will move up to head a special case unit with personnel of his choosing.

Life for the blue-collar men of the port is increasingly hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed for this kind of influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money.

It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container that was supposed to be smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.

After a dispute over stolen goods turns violent, Sobotka&#x27;s wayward son Ziggy is charged with the murder of one of the Greek&#x27;s underlings. Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. The Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The investigation ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.

Across town, the Barksdale organization continues its business under Stringer while Avon and D&#x27;Angelo Barksdale serve prison time. D&#x27;Angelo decides to cut ties to his family after his uncle organizes the deaths of several inmates and blames it on a corrupt guard to shave time from his sentence. Eventually Stringer covertly orders D&#x27;Angelo killed, with the murder staged to look like a suicide. Avon is unaware of Stringer&#x27;s duplicity and mourns the loss of his nephew.

Stringer also struggles, having been cut off by Avon&#x27;s drug suppliers in New York and left with increasingly poor-quality product. He again goes behind Avon&#x27;s back, giving up half of Avon&#x27;s most prized territory to a rival named Proposition Joe in exchange for a share of his supply, which is revealed to be coming from the Greek. Avon, unaware of the arrangement, assumes that Joe and other dealers are moving into his territory simply because the Barksdale organization has too few enforcers. He uses his New York connections to hire a feared assassin named Brother Mouzone.

Stringer deals with this by tricking his old adversary Omar into believing that Mouzone was responsible for the vicious killing of his partner in their feud in season one. Seeking revenge, Omar shoots Mouzone but, realizing Stringer has lied to him, calls 9-1-1. Mouzone recovers and leaves Baltimore, and Stringer (now with Avon&#x27;s consent) is able to continue his arrangement with Proposition Joe.

=== Season 3 (2004) ===
In the third season, the focus returns to the street and the Barksdale organization. The scope is expanded to include the city&#x27;s political scene. A new subplot is introduced to explore the potential positive effects of &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;legalizing&quot; the illegal drug trade, and incidentally prostitution, within the limited boundaries of a few uninhabited city blocks—referred to as &quot;Hamsterdam&quot;. The posited benefits, as in Amsterdam and other European cities, are reduced street crime city-wide and increased outreach of health and social services to vulnerable people. These are continuations of stories hinted at earlier.

The demolition of the residential towers that had served as the Barksdale organization&#x27;s prime territory pushes their dealers back out onto the streets of Baltimore. Stringer Bell continues his reform of the organization by cooperating with other drug lords, sharing with one another territory, product and profits. Stringer&#x27;s proposal is met with a curt refusal from Marlo Stanfield, leader of a new, growing crew.

Against Stringer&#x27;s advice, Avon decides to take Marlo&#x27;s territory by force and the two gangs become embroiled in a bitter turf war with multiple deaths. Omar Little continues to rob the Barksdale organization wherever possible. Working with his new boyfriend Dante and two women, he is once more a serious problem. The violence related to the drug trade makes it an obvious choice of investigation for Cedric Daniels&#x27; permanently established Major Crimes Unit.

Councilman Tommy Carcetti begins to prepare himself for a mayoral race. He manipulates a colleague into running against the mayor to split the black vote, secures a capable campaign manager and starts making headlines for himself.

Approaching the end of his career, Major Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin of Baltimore&#x27;s Western District wants to effect some real change in the troubled neighborhoods for which he has long been responsible. Without the knowledge of central command, Colvin sets up areas where police would monitor, but not punish, the drug trade. The police crack down severely on violence in these areas and also on drug trafficking elsewhere in the city.

For many weeks, Colvin&#x27;s experiment works and crime is reduced in his district. Colvin&#x27; superiors, the media and city politicians eventually find out about the arrangement and the &quot;Hamsterdam&quot; experiment ends. With top brass outraged, Colvin is forced to cease his actions, accept a demotion and retire from the Police Department on a lower-grade pension. Tommy Carcetti uses the scandal to make a grandstanding speech at a weekly Baltimore city council meeting.

In another strand, Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise, once a drug dealer&#x27;s enforcer, is released from a fourteen-year prison term with a street contact from Avon. Cutty initially wishes to go straight partly to reignite his relationship with a former girlfriend. He tries to work as a manual laborer, but struggles to adapt to life as a free man. He then flirts with his former life, going to work for Avon. Finding he no longer has the heart for murder, he quits the Barksdale crew. Later, he uses funding from Avon to purchase new equipment for his nascent boxing gym.

The Major Crimes Unit learns that Stringer has been buying real estate and developing it to fulfill his dream of being a successful legitimate businessman. Believing that the bloody turf war with Marlo is poised to destroy everything the Barksdale crew had worked for, Stringer gives Major Colvin information on Avon&#x27;s weapons stash. Brother Mouzone returns to Baltimore and tracks down Omar to join forces. Mouzone tells Avon that his shooting must be avenged. Avon, remembering how Stringer disregarded his order which resulted in Stringer&#x27;s attempt to have Brother Mouzone killed, furious over D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s murder to which Stringer had confessed, and fearing Mouzone&#x27;s ability to harm his reputation outside of Baltimore, informs Mouzone of Stringer&#x27;s upcoming visit to his construction site. Mouzone and Omar corner him and shoot him to death.

Colvin tells McNulty about Avon&#x27;s hideout and armed with the information gleaned from selling the Barksdale crew pre-wiretapped disposable cell phones, the detail stages a raid, arresting Avon and most of his underlings. Barksdale&#x27;s criminal empire lies in ruins and Marlo&#x27;s young crew simply moves into their territory. The drug trade in West Baltimore continues.

=== Season 4 (2006) ===

The fourth season concentrates on the school system and the mayoral race. It takes a closer look at Marlo Stanfield&#x27;s drug gang, which has grown to control most of western Baltimore&#x27;s trafficking, and Dukie, Randy, Michael, and Namondfour boys from West Baltimoreas they enter the eighth grade. Prez has begun a new career as a mathematics teacher at the same school. The cold-blooded Marlo has come to dominate the streets of the west side, using murder and intimidation to make up for his weak-quality drugs and lack of business acumen. His enforcers Chris Partlow and Snoop conceal their numerous victims in abandoned and boarded-up row houses where the bodies will not be readily discovered. The disappearances of so many known criminals come to mystify both the major crimes unit investigating Marlo and the homicide unit assigned to solve the presumed murders. Marlo coerces Bodie into working under him.

McNulty is a patrolman and lives with Beadie Russell. He politely refuses offers from Daniels who is now a major and commanding the Western District. Detectives Kima Greggs and Lester Freamon, as part of the major crimes unit, investigate Avon Barksdale&#x27;s political donations and serve several key figures with subpoenas. Their work is shut down by Commissioner Ervin Burrell at Mayor Clarence Royce&#x27;s request, and after being placed under stricter supervision within their unit, both Greggs and Freamon request and receive transfer to the homicide division.

Meanwhile, the city&#x27;s mayoral primary race enters its closing weeks. Royce initially has a seemingly insurmountable lead over challengers Tommy Carcetti and Tony Gray, with a big war chest and major endorsements. Royce&#x27;s lead begins to fray, as his own political machinations turn against him and Carcetti starts to highlight the city&#x27;s crime problem. Carcetti is propelled to victory in the primary election.

Howard &quot;Bunny&quot; Colvin joins a research group attempting to study potential future criminals in the middle school population. Dennis &quot;Cutty&quot; Wise continues to work with boys in his boxing gym, and accepts a job at the school rounding up truants. Prez has a few successes with his students, but some of them start to slip away. Disruptive Namond is removed from class and placed in the research group, where he gradually develops affection and respect for Colvin. Randy, in a moment of desperation, reveals knowledge of a murder to the assistant principal, leading to his being interrogated by police. When Bubbles takes Sherrod, a homeless teenager, under his wing, he fails in his attempts to encourage the boy to return to school.

Proposition Joe tries to engineer conflict between Omar Little and Marlo to convince Marlo to join the co-op. Omar robs Marlo who, in turn, frames Omar for a murder and organizes attempts to have him murdered in jail but Omar manages to beat the charge with the help of Bunk. Omar is told that Marlo set him up, so takes revenge on him by robbing the entire shipment of the co-op. Marlo is furious with Joe for allowing the shipment to be stolen. Marlo demands satisfaction, and as a result, Joe sets up a meeting between him and Spiros Vondas, who assuages Marlo&#x27;s concerns. Having gotten a lead on Joe&#x27;s connection to the Greeks, Marlo begins investigating them to learn more about their role in bringing narcotics into Baltimore.

Freamon discovers the bodies Chris and Snoop had hidden. Bodie offers McNulty testimony against Marlo and his crew, but is shot dead on his corner by O-Dog, a member of Marlo&#x27;s crew. Sherrod dies after snorting a poisoned vial of heroin that, unbeknownst to him, Bubbles had prepared for their tormentor. Bubbles turns himself in to the police and tries to hang himself, but he survives and is taken to a detox facility. Michael has now joined the ranks of Marlo&#x27;s killers and runs one of his corners, with Dukie leaving high school to work there. Randy&#x27;s house is firebombed by school bullies for his cooperation with the police, leaving his caring foster mother hospitalized and sending him back to a group home. Namond is taken in by Colvin, who recognized the good in him. The major crimes unit from earlier seasons is largely reunited, and they resume their investigation of Marlo Stanfield.

=== Season 5 (2008) ===
The fifth and final season focuses on the media and media consumption. The show features a fictional depiction of the newspaper &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and in fact elements of the plot are ripped-from-the-headlines events (such as the Jayson Blair &quot;New York Times&quot; scandal) and people at the &quot;Sun&quot;. The season, according to David Simon, deals with &quot;what stories get told and what don&#x27;t and why it is that things stay the same.&quot; Issues such as the quest for profit, the decrease in the number of reporters, and the end of aspiration for news quality would all be addressed, alongside the theme of homelessness. John Carroll of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; was the model for the &quot;craven, prize hungry&quot; editor of the fictional newspaper.

Fifteen months after the fourth season concludes, Mayor Carcetti&#x27;s cuts in the police budget to redress the education deficit force the Marlo Stanfield investigation to shut down. Cedric Daniels secures a detail to focus on the prosecution of Senator Davis for corruption. Detective McNulty returns to the Homicide unit and decides to divert resources back to the Police Department by faking evidence to make it appear that a serial killer is murdering homeless men.

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; also faces budget cuts and the newsroom struggles to adequately cover the city, omitting many important stories. Commissioner Burrell continues to falsify crime statistics and is fired by Carcetti, who positions Daniels to replace him.

Marlo Stanfield lures his enemy Omar Little out of retirement by having Omar&#x27;s mentor Butchie murdered. Proposition Joe teaches Stanfield how to launder money and evade investigation. Once Joe is no longer useful to him, Stanfield has Joe killed with the help of Joe&#x27;s nephew Cheese Wagstaff and usurps his position with the Greeks and the New Day Co-Op. Michael Lee continues working as a Stanfield enforcer, providing a home for his friend Dukie and younger brother Bug.

Omar returns to Baltimore seeking revenge, targeting Stanfield&#x27;s organization, stealing and destroying money and drugs and killing Stanfield enforcers in an attempt to force Stanfield into the open. However, he is eventually shot and killed by Kenard, a young Stanfield dealer.

&quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter Scott Templeton claims to have been contacted by McNulty&#x27;s fake serial killer. City Editor Gus Haynes becomes suspicious, but his superiors are enamored of Templeton. McNulty backs up Templeton&#x27;s claim in order to further legitimize his fabricated serial killer. The story gains momentum and Carcetti spins the resulting attention on homelessness into a key issue in his imminent campaign for Governor and restores funding to the Police Department.

Bubbles is recovering from his drug addiction while living in his sister&#x27;s basement. He is befriended by &quot;Sun&quot; reporter Mike Fletcher, who eventually writes a profile of Bubbles.

Bunk is disgusted with McNulty&#x27;s serial killer scheme and tries to have Lester Freamon reason with McNulty. Instead, Freamon helps McNulty perpetuate the lie and uses resources earmarked for the case to fund an illegal wiretap on Stanfield. Bunk resumes working the vacant house murders, leading to a murder warrant against Partlow for killing Michael&#x27;s stepfather.

Freamon and Leander Sydnor gather enough evidence to arrest Stanfield and most of his top lieutenants, seizing a large quantity of drugs. Stanfield suspects that Michael is an informant, and orders him killed. Michael realizes he is being set up and kills Snoop instead. A wanted man, he leaves Bug with an aunt and begins a career as a stick-up man. With his support system gone, Dukie lives with drug addicts.

McNulty tells Kima Greggs about his fabrications to prevent her wasting time on the case. Greggs tells Daniels, who, along with Rhonda Pearlman, takes this news to Carcetti, who orders a cover-up because of the issue&#x27;s importance to his campaign.

Davis is acquitted, but Freamon uses the threat of federal prosecution to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which would jeopardize the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy&#x27;s espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield&#x27;s release on the condition that he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.

As the cover-up begins, a copy-cat killing occurs, but McNulty quickly identifies and arrests the culprit. Pearlman tells McNulty and Freamon that they can no longer be allowed to do investigative work and warns of criminal charges if the scandal becomes public. They opt to retire. Haynes attempts to expose Templeton, but the managing editors ignore the fabrications and demote anyone critical of their star reporter. Carcetti pressures Daniels to falsify crime statistics to aid his campaign. Daniels refuses and then quietly resigns rather than have his FBI file leaked.

In a final montage, McNulty gazes over the city; Freamon enjoys retirement; Templeton wins a Pulitzer; Carcetti becomes Governor; Haynes is sidelined to the copy desk and replaced by Fletcher; Campbell appoints Valchek as commissioner; Carcetti appoints Rawls as Superintendent of the Maryland State Police; Dukie continues to use heroin; Pearlman becomes a judge and Daniels a defense attorney; Bubbles is allowed upstairs where he enjoys a family dinner; Michael Lee becomes the new stick up boy, replacing Omar; Chris serves his life sentence alongside Wee-Bey; the drug trade continues; and the people of Baltimore go on with their lives.

=== Prequel shorts ===
During the fifth season, HBO produced three shorts depicting moments in the history of characters in &quot;The Wire&quot;. The three prequels depict the first meeting between McNulty and Bunk; Proposition Joe as a slick business kid; and young Omar. The shorts are available on the complete series DVD set.

== Reception and legacy ==

=== Critical response ===
All seasons of &quot;The Wire&quot; have received positive reviews from major television critics, with seasons two through five in particular receiving near universal acclaim, with several naming it the best contemporary show and one of the best drama series of all time. The first season received mainly positive reviews from critics, some even calling it superior to HBO&#x27;s better-known &quot;flagship&quot; drama series such as &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;. On the review aggregator Metacritic, the first season scored 79 out of 100 based on 22 reviews. One reviewer pointed to the retread of some themes from HBO and David Simon&#x27;s earlier works, but still found it valuable viewing and particularly resonant because it parallels the war on terror through the chronicling of the war on drugs. Another review postulated that the series might suffer because of its reliance on profanity and slowly drawn-out plot, but was largely positive about the show&#x27;s characters and intrigue.

Despite the critical acclaim, &quot;The Wire&quot; received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon attributed to the complexity of the plot; a poor time slot; heavy use of esoteric slang, particularly among the gangster characters; and a predominantly black cast. Critics felt the show was testing the attention span of its audience and that it was mistimed in the wake of the launch of the successful crime drama &quot;The Shield&quot; on FX. However, anticipation for a release of the first season on DVD was high at &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;.

After the first two episodes of season two, Jim Shelley in &quot;The Guardian&quot; called &quot;The Wire&quot; the best show on TV, praising the second season for its ability to detach from its former foundations in the first season. Jon Garelick with the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.

The critical response to the third season remained positive. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;The Wire&quot; the best show of 2004, describing it as &quot;the smartest, deepest and most resonant drama on TV.&quot; They credited the complexity of the show for its poor ratings. The &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; was so concerned that the show might be cancelled that it published a list of ten reasons to keep it on the air, including strong characterization, Omar Little, and an unabashedly honest representation of real world problems. It also worried that the loss of the show would have a negative impact on Baltimore&#x27;s economy.

At the close of the third season, &quot;The Wire&quot; was still struggling to maintain its ratings and the show faced possible cancellation. Creator David Simon blamed the show&#x27;s low ratings in part on its competition against &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; and worried that expectations for HBO dramas had changed following the success of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;.

As the fourth season was about to begin, almost two years after the previous season&#x27;s end, Tim Goodman of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote that &quot;The Wire&quot; &quot;has tackled the drug war in this country as it simultaneously explores race, poverty and &#x27;the death of the American working class,&#x27; the failure of political systems to help the people they serve, and the tyranny of lost hope. Few series in the history of television have explored the plight of inner-city African Americans and none—not one—has done it as well.&quot; Brian Lowry of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote at the time, &quot;When television history is written, little else will rival &#x27;The Wire.&#x27;&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the fourth season of &quot;The Wire&quot; &quot;its best season yet.&quot;

Doug Elfman of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was more reserved in his praise, calling it the &quot;most ambitious&quot; show on television, but faulting it for its complexity and the slow development of the plotline. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; took the rare step of devoting an editorial to the show, stating that &quot;even in what is generally acknowledged to be something of a golden era for thoughtful and entertaining dramas—both on cable channels and on network TV—&quot;The Wire&quot; stands out.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine especially praised the fourth season, stating that &quot;no other TV show has ever loved a city so well, damned it so passionately, or sung it so searingly.&quot;

On Metacritic, seasons three and four received a weighted average score of 98. Andrew Johnston of &quot;Time Out New York&quot; named &quot;The Wire&quot; the best TV series of 2006, and wrote, &quot;The first three seasons of David Simon&#x27;s epic meditations on urban America established &quot;The Wire&quot; as one of the best series of the decade, and with season four--centered on the heart-breaking tale of four eighth-graders whose prospects are limited by public-school bureaucracy--it officially became one for the ages.&quot;

Several reviewers called it the best show on television, including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Slate&quot;, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot; and the British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which ran a week-by-week blog following every episode, also collected in a book, &quot;The Wire Re-up&quot;. Charlie Brooker, a columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, has been particularly enthusiastic in his praise of the show, both in his &quot;Screen Burn&quot; column and in his BBC Four television series &quot;Screenwipe&quot;, calling it possibly the greatest show of the last 20 years.

In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; listed it among the one hundred best television series of all-time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked &quot;The Wire&quot; as the ninth best written TV series. In 2013, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked &quot;The Wire&quot; as the fifth greatest drama and the sixth greatest show of all time. In 2013, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed the show at No. 6 in their list of the &quot;26 Best Cult TV Shows Ever,&quot; describing it as &quot;one of the most highly praised series in HBO history&quot; and praising Michael K. Williams&#x27;s acting as Omar Little. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also named it the number one TV show of all-time in a special issue in 2013.

In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it second on its list of the 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and ranked it fourth in 2022. In September 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, which ranked the show #2 on its list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century, described it as &quot;polemical, panoramic, funny, tragic or all of those things at once&quot;, saying it was &quot;beautifully written and performed&quot; and was both &quot;TV as high art and TV wrenched from the soul&quot; and &quot;an exemplar of a certain brand of intelligent, ambitious and uncompromising television&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked &quot;The Wire&quot; at number four on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. Also in 2021, &quot;The Wire&quot; was ranked first by the BBC on its list of the 100 greatest TV series of the 21st century. In 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; ranked &quot;The Wire&quot; as the seventh-greatest TV show of all time.

Critics have often described the show in literary terms: the &quot;New York Times&quot; calls it &quot;literary television;&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; calls it &quot;TV as great modern literature;&quot; the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; says the series &quot;must be considered alongside the best literature and filmmaking in the modern era;&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; says the show delivers &quot;rewards not unlike those won by readers who conquer Joyce, Faulkner or Henry James.&quot; &#x27;The Wire Files&#x27;, an online collection of articles published in &quot;darkmatter Journal&quot;, critically analyzes &quot;The Wire&quot; racialized politics and aesthetics of representation. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; put it on its end-of-the-decade, &quot;best-of&quot; list, saying, &quot;The deft writing—which used the cop-genre format to give shape to creator David Simon&#x27;s scathing social critiques—was matched by one of the deepest benches of acting talent in TV history.&quot;

Former President of the United States Barack Obama has said that &quot;The Wire&quot; is his favorite television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot;. The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, has gone so far as to say that he would not enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series.

Robert Kirkman, creator of &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, is a strong follower of &quot;The Wire&quot;; he has tried to cast as many actors from it into the television series of the same name as possible, so far having cast Chad Coleman, Lawrence Gilliard Jr., Seth Gilliam, and Merritt Wever.

=== Awards ===


&quot;The Wire&quot; was nominated for and won a wide variety of awards, including nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for &quot;Middle Ground&quot; (2004) and &quot;–30–&quot; (2008), NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Drama Series for each of its five seasons, Television Critics Association Awards (TCA), and Writers Guild of America Awards (WGA).

Most of the awards the series won were for season 4 and season 5. These included the Directors Guild of America Award and TCA Heritage Award for season 5, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Dramatic Series for season 4, plus the Crime Thriller Award, Eddie Award, Edgar Award, and Irish Film &amp; Television Academy Award. The series also won the ASCAP Award, Artios Award, and Peabody Award for season 2.

The series won the &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; Critics&#x27; Poll Award for Best Drama (season 4) and won &quot;Time&quot; critics choice for top television show for season 1 and season 3.

Despite the above mentioned awards and unanimous critical approval, &quot;The Wire&quot; never won a single Primetime Emmy Award, receiving only two writing nominations in 2005 and 2008. Several critics recognized its lack of recognition by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. According to a report by &quot;Variety&quot;, anonymous Emmy voters cited reasons such as the series&#x27; dense and multilayered plot, the grim subject matter, and the series&#x27; lack of connection with California, as it is set and filmed in Baltimore.

=== Academia ===
In the years following the end of the series&#x27; run, several colleges and universities such as Johns Hopkins, Brown University, and Harvard College have offered classes on &quot;The Wire&quot; in disciplines ranging from law to sociology to film studies. Phillips Academy, a boarding high school in Massachusetts, offers a similar course as well. University of Texas at San Antonio offers a course where the series is taught as a work of literary fiction.

In an article published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Anmol Chaddha and William Julius Wilson explain why Harvard chose &quot;The Wire&quot; as curriculum material for their course on urban inequality: &quot;Though scholars know that deindustrialization, crime and prison, and the education system are deeply intertwined, they must often give focused attention to just one subject in relative isolation, at the expense of others. With the freedom of artistic expression, &quot;The Wire&quot; can be more creative. It can weave together the range of forces that shape the lives of the urban poor.&quot;

University of York&#x27;s Head of Sociology, Roger Burrows, said in &quot;The Independent&quot; that the show &quot;makes a fantastic contribution to their understanding of contemporary urbanism&quot;, and is &quot;a contrast to dry, dull, hugely expensive studies that people carry out on the same issues&quot;. The series is also studied as part of a Master seminar series at the Paris West University Nanterre La Défense. In February 2012, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek gave a lecture at Birkbeck, University of London titled &quot;The Wire or the clash of civilisations in one country&quot;. In April 2012, Norwegian academic Erlend Lavik posted online a 36-minute video essay called &quot;Style in &quot;The Wire&quot;&quot; which analyzes the various visual techniques used by the show&#x27;s directors over the course of its five seasons.

&quot;The Wire&quot; has also been the subject of growing numbers of academic articles by, amongst others, Fredric Jameson (who praised the series&#x27; ability to weave utopian thinking into its realist representation of society); and Leigh Claire La Berge, who argues that although the less realistic character of season five was received negatively by critics, it gives the series a platform not only for representing reality, but for representing how realism is itself a construct of social forces like the media; both commentators see in &quot;The Wire&quot; an impulse for progressive political change rare in mass media productions. While most academics have used &quot;The Wire&quot; as a cultural object or case study, Benjamin Leclair-Paquet has instead argued that the &quot;creative methods behind HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Wire&quot; evoke original ways to experiment with speculative work that reveal the merit of the imaginary as a pragmatic research device.&quot; This author posits that the methods behind &quot;The Wire&quot; are particularly relevant for contentious urban and architectural projects.

== Broadcast ==

HBO aired the five seasons of the show in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2008. New episodes were shown once a week, occasionally skipping one or two weeks in favor of other programming. Starting with the fourth season, subscribers to the HBO On Demand service were able to see each episode of the season six days earlier. American basic cable network BET also aired the show. BET adds commercial breaks, blurs some nudity, and mutes some profanity. Much of the waterfront storyline from the second season is edited out from the BET broadcasts.

The series was remastered in 16:9 high-definition in late 2014. As the series was shot with a 16:9-safe area, the remastered series is an open matte of the original 4:3 framing. Creator David Simon approved the new version, and worked with HBO to remove film equipment and crew members, and solve actor sync problems in the widened frame. The remastered series debuted on HBO Signature, airing the entire series consecutively, and on HBO GO on December 26, 2014.

In the United Kingdom, the show has been broadcast on FX until 2009 when the BBC bought terrestrial television rights to &quot;The Wire&quot; in 2008, when it was broadcast on BBC Two, although controversially it was broadcast at 11:20 pm and catchup was not available on BBC iPlayer. In a world first, British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; made the first episode of the first season available to stream on its website for a brief period and all episodes were aired in Ireland on the public service channel TG4 approximately six months after the original air dates on HBO.

<doc id="1102461" wikidata="Q937350" url="?curid=1102461" title="The Wire (magazine)">
<text>The Wire (or simply Wire) is a British music magazine publishing out of London, which has been issued monthly in print since 1982. Its website launched in 1997, and an online archive of its entire back catalog became available to subscribers in 2013. Since 1985, the magazine&#x27;s annual year-in-review issue, Rewind, has named an album or release of the year based on critics&#x27; ballots.

Originally, &quot;The Wire&quot; covered the British jazz scene with an emphasis on avant-garde and free jazz. It was marketed as a more adventurous alternative to its conservative competitor &quot;Jazz Journal&quot;, and targeted younger readers at a time when &quot;Melody Maker&quot; had abandoned jazz coverage. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the magazine expanded its scope until it included a broad range of musical genres under the umbrella of non-mainstream or experimental music. Since then, &quot;The Wire&quot;″s coverage has included experimental rock, electronica, alternative hip hop, modern classical, free improvisation, nu jazz and traditional music.

The magazine has been independently owned since 2001, when the six permanent staff members purchased the magazine from previous owner Naim Attallah.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Wire&quot; is a monthly magazine that specialises in a diverse spectrum of avant-garde and experimental music. A 1999 subscription flyer for the magazine advertised its subject matter as &quot;non-mainstream&quot; music. In the late 1980s and early 1990s &quot;The Wire&quot; transitioned from exclusive coverage of jazz to coverage of contemporary music in general, maintaining its prioritisation of the avant-garde. Since its founding in 1982, its monthly circulation has reportedly ranged from about 7,000 to about 20,000.

Within the American and British music journalism markets, &quot;The Wire&quot; was among a generation of music magazines launched in the 1980s. That decade also saw the debuts of &quot;The Face&quot; (1980), &quot;Kerrang!&quot; (1981), &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; (1982), &quot;Mixmag&quot; (1983), &quot;Alternative Press&quot; (1985), &quot;Spin&quot; (1985), &quot;Q&quot; (1986), &quot;Hip Hop Connection&quot; (1988) and &quot;The Source&quot; (1988), among others. According to writer Simon Warner, &quot;The Wire&quot; took on a level of &quot;influence disproportionate to its niche readership&quot; compared to other music magazines born in the 1980s, because &quot;not only listeners but music makers and producers were drawn to its columns.&quot;

Most of these magazines, &quot;The Wire&quot; included, differentiated themselves by targeting a narrow segment of readers based on demographics and taste. This was commonly done, for example, by devoting coverage to specific musical subcultures as &quot;Kerrang!&quot; did with heavy metal or &quot;The Source&quot; with hip hop. Another industry trend was polarization between two styles of writing: popular criticism for mass-market consumers versus intellectual criticism for underground music connoisseurs. &quot;The Wire&quot; was certainly positioned on the &quot;highbrow&quot; end of the industry—even if, as editor Tony Herrington said, the magazine preferred &quot;intelligence to intellectualism&quot;. Its embrace of high-minded, literate criticism aligned it with publications such as &quot;New Statesman&quot;, a politics and culture magazine that started to publish pieces by rock journalists, and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, which had hired a group of academically oriented new writers like Simon Reynolds who were influenced by post-structuralism. &quot;The Wire&quot; contrasted most sharply in approach with &quot;Q&quot;, which emphasised celebrity personalities and the classic-rock canon.

&quot;The Wire&quot; was among the major British music magazines of the 1990s, a decade that represented an overall peak for the print magazine industry before the next two decades brought the rise of digital journalism and a general decline in print readership. However, &quot;The Wire&quot; has held a steady circulation and remained in print even as other magazines that once sported much larger circulations have folded or become online-only titles. &quot;NME&quot; once sold 300,000 weekly copies at its peak in the 1970s, but by 2016 it only sold 20,000—the same number &quot;The Wire&quot; sold at that time—and in March 2018 &quot;NME&quot; ended its print edition altogether. &quot;The Wire&quot; was considered one of the most significant independently owned publications covering the musical underground in the 2000s, alongside &quot;Fact&quot;, &quot;Rock-A-Rolla&quot;, &quot;Dusted&quot; and innumerable blogs.

===1982: Founding as a jazz magazine===

&quot;The Wire&quot; debuted as a quarterly jazz magazine in the summer of 1982. The magazine was co-founded by jazz promoter Anthony Wood and journalist Chrissie Murray. Lacking office space, Wood and Murray prepared the first issues of the magazine from an Italian restaurant on St Martin&#x27;s Lane. The staff sold copies of the first issue to concert-goers at a jazz festival in Knebworth and at the Camden Jazz Festival.

At that time, Germany was considered the cultural centre of jazz in Europe—especially European free jazz. There was greater cultural appreciation for jazz in Germany than in Britain and a greater volume of dedicated press coverage, even though the British jazz scene was actually larger. In an introductory essay explaining the magazine&#x27;s editorial policy and scope, Wood wrote that &quot;The Wire&quot; intended to target the demographic of listeners under the age of 25, who he felt were poorly served by the state of jazz writing in Britain. The only other British jazz magazine in print at the time was &quot;Jazz Journal&quot;, which Wood criticised for its conservative approach: &quot;the reverend gentlemen at &quot;Jazz Journal&quot; continue, at best, to admit only grudgingly that jazz has got beyond 1948; at worst, deny its current development.&quot; In addition, Wood noted, the British weekly magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; had by 1982 virtually abandoned jazz coverage.

&quot;The Wire&quot; would emphasise boundary-pushing musicians; at the outset, Wood declared that free jazz and free improvisation would &quot;be given a loud enough voice to be heard above the dissenters who are still questioning the music&#x27;s validity.&quot; The magazine was named after &quot;The Wire&quot;, a composition by American jazz saxophonist Steve Lacy, whose &quot;musical farsightedness&quot; the magazine hoped to emulate. Twenty years later, Lacy&#x27;s composition was used as the opening track of the box set &quot;The Wire 20 Years 1982–2002&quot;.

===1983–84: Acquisition by the Namara Group===
In 1984, Wood sold &quot;The Wire&quot; to Naim Attallah and it became part of the Namara Group. Attallah&#x27;s other properties included &quot;Literary Review&quot; and Quartet Books. Wood announced the new owner, along with a switch from quarterly to monthly publishing, in the October 1984 issue.

Reflecting on the early years as part of the Namara Group, Tony Herrington said:

Attallah&#x27;s &quot;laissez-faire&quot; attitude and the magazine&#x27;s editorial freedom contrasted with the state of other UK music magazines in the 1980s. Competition among weeklies like &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Sounds&quot; heightened in the 1980s, and these publications began to prioritise circulation, advertising and commercial appeal, which resulted in editorial constraint. &quot;The Wire&quot; did not impose significant editorial demands or stylistic revisions on its writers and, as such, it became an attractive publication for freelancers who had started their careers at UK weeklies during the post-punk era.

===1985–1992: Expanding beyond jazz===
Former &quot;NME&quot; staffer Richard Cook took over as editor in July 1985; by September, Wood&#x27;s name was gone altogether from the masthead. Around this time there was a resurgence of interest in jazz among white British &quot;hipsters&quot;—a trend that lasted until the 1987 &quot;Black Monday&quot; market crash. As editor, Cook refurbished &quot;The Wire&quot; so it would seem stylish and appealing to the new wave of British jazz hipsters, but he increasingly steered the magazine toward a pluralistic, multi-genre approach. &quot;The Wire&quot; also began to develop a house style that tended toward the philosophical and cerebral, printing &quot;articles peppered with references to Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, or Jacques Attali&#x27;s monograph .&quot;

Under Cook&#x27;s editorial oversight, &quot;The Wire&quot; significantly broadened its coverage of music in genres other than jazz. He hired a new graphic design team and promoted longtime contributor Mark Sinker to assistant editor. The formerly jazz-focused magazine&#x27;s covers in this period featured decidedly non-jazz artists like Michael Jackson, Prince, Philip Glass, John Lee Hooker and Van Morrison; meanwhile, articles published inside the magazine profiled a broad range of musicians, including Elvis Costello, Stravinsky, Mozart, Frank Zappa, Prokofiev, Bob Marley and Haydn.

Cook told &quot;Jazz Forum&quot; in 1991 that &quot;The Wire&quot; was &quot;going into overdrive&quot; with ambitions to expand its domestic and international sales. Estimating the magazine&#x27;s monthly circulation at 15,000–20,000 copies, Cook said he hoped to reach 25,000. But his efforts to expand the magazine&#x27;s circulation had mixed results. Chris Parker, the magazine&#x27;s publisher between 1984 and 1989, said the changes did not make an &quot;appreciable&quot; increase in sales; in Parker&#x27;s view, &quot;for every would-be hip young thing we recruited to the readership, we lost a diehard jazz fan who just wished to know if Howard Riley or Stan Tracey had made another album and what it was like.&quot;

Regardless of Cook&#x27;s impact on sales figures, several of his contemporaries acknowledged that he had made &quot;The Wire&quot; a more accessible publication. Scottish writer Brian Morton said &quot;[u]nder Cook&#x27;s editorship, &quot;The Wire&quot; evolved from a small, magazine into a more broadly based music journal that covered mainstream jazz as well as the avant-garde, but one that also began moving into other areas of music: pop, soul, reggae, classical.&quot; John Fordham, the jazz critic for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, credited Cook with &quot;transforming [&quot;The Wire&quot;″s] content and design and opening out a specialised, sometimes uninviting publication&quot; to a broader audience. British-Ghanaian writer Kodwo Eshun pointed to &quot;Black Science Fiction&quot;, an essay by Sinker from the February 1992 issue, as a major influence on Afrofuturism, a term that was coined the following year.

===1992–1994: Mark Sinker&#x27;s editorship===
In June 1992, Cook left &quot;The Wire&quot; for a position at PolyGram UK and was succeeded by Sinker. Cook&#x27;s departure coincided with the magazine&#x27;s 100th issue, an unannounced move that caught Sinker by surprise. Though he only served as editor for 18 months, Sinker took a bold editorial approach. During his brief tenure, few covers featured portraits of musicians, and instead often featured abstract photos of isolated objects, like a sofa or a toy robot. Sinker devoted issues to broad themes such as &quot;Music and Censorship&quot;, &quot;Music in the Realm of Bodily Desire&quot; and &quot;Music and the American Dream&quot;, and for these issues he commissioned multiple argumentative essays on those topics. In retrospect, he characterised his attitude as editor thusly:

Sinker&#x27;s vision—later characterised as &quot;a thorny, quizzical, fanzine cum proto-Weblog&quot;—clashed with then-publisher Adele Yaron&#x27;s ideal of &quot;a sleek and stylish urban music &#x27;n&#x27; lifestyle monthly&quot;. Yaron fired Sinker when a potential buyer requested his removal as part of, in Sinker&#x27;s words, the &quot;bride price&quot; for the deal.

While Sinker&#x27;s stint as editor was brief and controversial, music writers have praised his editorial decisions in retrospect and highlighted his influence on the magazine&#x27;s future directions. The French writer-musician Rubin Steiner considered the August 1993 issue with Björk on the cover to be a definitive turning point, signalling the start of constant changes in coverage that would follow, after which &quot;The Wire&quot; could no longer be considered a jazz magazine. &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Maggoty Lamb said Sinker&#x27;s tenure was &quot;visionary&quot; and had laid the &quot;foundation&quot; for the magazine to become a &quot;thriving institutional presence&quot;. At &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Tom Ewing argued that the argumentative articles Sinker commissioned &quot;weren&#x27;t simply trying to shock or drive readers off—they achieved both—but were trying to build, as ... Sinker put it, [a place] where people could &#x27;have fun starting arguments,&#x27; ones that could co-exist within a comfort zone.&quot;

===1994–1999: &quot;Adventures in Modern Music&quot;===
After Sinker was sacked, Tony Herrington took over as editor starting with the March 1994 issue. Herrington had contributed to the magazine as a freelancer since the 1980s, but he had minimal experience as an editor and had only become a permanent staffer the year prior. Yaron left shortly afterward, and so Herrington assumed the position of publisher as well. By January 1995 the magazine adopted the new subtitle &quot;Adventures in Modern Music&quot;, which it used continuously until 2012.

Two months after Herrington became editor, the magazine published an influential piece by Simon Reynolds in which he defined the parameters of the genre &quot;post-rock&quot;. The genre and its associated artists became a focus for the magazine in the mid to late 1990s, along with electronica and nascent subgenres like illbient and glitch. Throughout the decade, Reynolds also contributed a series of essays on post-rave trends in UK dance music, covering jungle, drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass, hardstep, neurofunk and 2-step garage. These essays culminated in his theorizing of the &quot;hardcore continuum&quot;: a diverse, ever-evolving tradition of electronic dance music that had diverged from American-born house and techno to become a distinctly British style.

The magazine launched its website, , in October 1997. By 1999, the magazine reportedly reached a monthly circulation of about 20,000 copies.

===2000–present: Staff buyout and independent ownership===
Rob Young became editor in March 2000. Later that year, the magazine&#x27;s staff bought it from the Namara Group. When Herrington learned Naim Attallah was preparing for retirement and wanted to sell the magazine, he offered to buy it himself; Attallah replied &quot;I know how much I pay you and you can&#x27;t afford it.&quot; Herrington consulted with his fellow staffers, secured a loan and negotiated with Attallah for about six months. The six permanent members of the staff—Herrington, Young, Chris Bohn, Ben House, Anne Hilde Neset and Andy Tait—purchased the company on 21 December 2000 and announced the sale in the February 2001 issue. The magazine has been independently published since then.

In 2002, the magazine commemorated its 20th anniversary with a special issue, the publication of the book &quot;Undercurrents: The Hidden Wiring of Modern Music&quot; and a three-CD box set, &quot;The Wire 20 Years 1982–2002&quot;.

In the 2000s, &quot;The Wire&quot; devoted significant attention on the emerging genre of dubstep. Several musical genres were coined or first defined in the pages of &quot;The Wire&quot; in that decade, including microhouse, by Philip Sherburne, in 2001; New Weird America, by David Keenan, in 2003; and hypnagogic pop, also by Keenan, in 2009.

In 2007, &quot;The Wire&quot; reportedly sold about 17,500 copies per issue. A press release from the same year gave the magazine&#x27;s monthly circulation as 20,000 copies, with 9,000 subscribers. In 2013, the magazine made available its entire archive—amounting to 25,000 pages at that time—to subscribers, via the site Exact Editions.

==Content==
A series of new music compilation CDs called &quot;The Wire Tapper&quot; has been given away with the magazine since 1998. The magazine has used the strapline &quot;Adventures in Modern Music&quot; since 1994; on 14 December 2011 &quot;The Wire&#x27;s&quot; staff announced that the magazine&#x27;s old strapline &quot;Adventures In Modern Music&quot; had been replaced by &quot;Adventures In Sound And Music&quot;. In addition to the &quot;Wire Tapper&quot; CDs, subscribers receive label, country and festival samplers.

Apart from the numerous album reviews every month, the magazine has features such as &quot;The Invisible Jukebox&quot;, an interview conducted by way of unknown tracks being played to an artist, and &quot;The Primer&quot;, an in-depth article on a genre or act. It also features the avant music scene of a particular city every issue. In addition to its musical focus, the magazine likes to investigate cover art and mixed media artistic works.

Since January 2003 &quot;The Wire&quot; has been presenting a weekly radio programme on the London community radio station Resonance FM, which uses the magazine&#x27;s strapline as its title and is hosted in turns by members of &quot;The Wire&quot;.

&quot;The Wire&quot; celebrated its 400th issue in June 2017.

===Design and photography===
&quot;The Wire&quot; does not employ staff photographers. Instead, the magazine commissions all of its photography from freelancers or relies on musicians and labels to provide their own publicity photos. In recent years, the magazine has published work by photographers like Nigel Shafran, Todd Hido, Tom Hunter, Pieter Hugo, Alec Soth, Clare Shilland, Leon Chew, Jake Walters, Juan Diego Valera, Michael Schmelling, Mark Peckmezian, and Takashi Homma.

&quot;The Wire&quot;″s first art director was Terry Coleman. Paul Elliman took over art direction in January 1986; by July, he debuted a serif-typeface logo that the magazine would continue to use, with variations, until 2001. Lucy Ward succeeded Elliman as art director in July 1988 and introduced a broader array of fonts. Under both Elliman and Ward, the minimalist aesthetic of &quot;The Wire&quot; favoured simple typography, black-and-white photography and ample white space.

Elliman and Ward&#x27;s late-1980s work for &quot;The Wire&quot; has been praised by their contemporaries in the graphic design field. Robert Newman—a former design director at magazines like &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;The Village Voice&quot;—said &quot;The Wire&quot;″s minimal design contrasted with colourful late-80s trends in both British and American magazine design. Newman said he was inspired by Elliman&#x27;s designs and borrowed stylistic elements for his &quot;The Village Voice&quot; layouts. In Newman&#x27;s opinion, Elliman and Ward produced &quot;some of the most beautiful and remarkable magazine covers of that (or any) era, timeless designs that still look strikingly contemporary today.&quot; John L. Walters, an editor and owner of the quarterly design magazine &quot;Eye&quot; said their designs did not look &quot;home made or like academic papers (or both)&quot;, as other specialist magazines of the time tended to look, and said the magazine &quot;took musicians seriously, and its design made them look good without trying—be they stars, greying veterans or young turks.&quot; John O&#x27;Reilly cited Elliman&#x27;s work for &quot;The Wire&quot; among the &quot;most exciting and apparently vibrant work of the 1980s&quot; and said it shared a &quot;kind of melancholia&quot; with Neville Brody&#x27;s work from the period and Vaughan Oliver&#x27;s designs for the record label 4AD.

A major redesign was completed in 2001 by Non-Format, a design team composed of Kjell Ekhorn and Jon Forss, who were working out of an office next to &quot;The Wire&quot;. Ekhorn and Forss were the magazine&#x27;s art directors between 2001 and 2005. Herrington, who was familiar with their previous work designing music packaging, approached the team to redesign the magazine. In addition to designing the magazine&#x27;s current logo, they designed each issue of the magazine until 2005. While they retained the magazine&#x27;s overall clean, Modernist aesthetic, they incorporated highly intricate, unpredictable details into the designs of features. At first, Ekhorn and Forss created custom layouts and typographies in nearly every issue, rather than relying on standardised templates for features; however, this became too much work, and they eventually settled on using a single style across several months at a time. Their typographic work often added elaborate variations to base fonts, which included winding, branching curlicues and interwoven illustrative elements; Karen Sottosanti described their typical design work as &quot;type made of stars or flowers that exploded into negative space [and] type that merged with images of tree branches or birds.&quot;.

David Jury praised Non-Format&#x27;s designs, writing that the magazine &quot;retained an identity all its own through its creative use of experimental headline fonts, white space and excellent photography.&quot; Noteworthy examples of Non-Format&#x27;s cover art include the July 2004 issue, which portrayed the composer Alvin Lucier using brainwaves he had recorded with electrodes at a concert, and the December 2004 issue &quot;In Praise of the Riff&quot;, which placed repetitive black lines across the cover and pushed the logo to the bottom right, halfway off the page. In 2011 &quot;Complex&quot; named Non-Format&#x27;s March 2005 cover with MF Doom among the 50 greatest hip-hop magazine covers.

===&quot;The Wire&quot; Rewind===

Every January since 1986, &quot;The Wire&quot; has published a year-in-review issue with a critics&#x27; poll. The staff collates ballots submitted by its contributors into a list of the year&#x27;s best releases. Originally, the poll only selected the best jazz LP of the year. In 1992, the main poll grew to include albums in any musical genre, and in 2011 it began accepting releases in any format or medium, not just &quot;albums&quot;. In addition to the main all-genre list there are typically shorter lists of the best releases within selected genres as well. These year-in-review issues have been called Rewind since 1997.

Like the magazine itself, &quot;The Wire&quot;″s critics&#x27; polls have garnered a reputation for their unconventional, eclectic selections. &quot;Guardian&quot; columnist Maggoty Lamb commented in 2007 that &quot;The Wire&quot; has &quot;the annual best-of list most likely to single out an ensemble called Kiss the Anus of the Black Cat as having made &#x27;one of the most interesting records of the year&#x27;.&quot; When the magazine named James Ferraro&#x27;s vaporwave album &quot;Far Side Virtual&quot; its 2011 Release of the Year, Eric Grandy remarked in &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot; that it was &quot;[n]o surprise that willfully obscurantist British rag &quot;the Wire&quot;″s Best of 2011 list is topped by James Ferraro&#x27;s winking Windows &#x27;97 soft-rock hellscape ... and further ranges from the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Smile Sessions&quot; to Laurel Halo and Hype Williams.&quot;

==Reception==
Over the years, &quot;The Wire&quot; has received both praise and derision. Positive commentary about the magazine has often referred to its diverse range of coverage and unique status as a longstanding publication devoted to music outside the mainstream. In 2005 the writer Bill Martin called it an &quot;invaluable resource&quot; and said &quot;there is no other English-language magazine today of comparable scope.&quot; On the occasion of the magazine&#x27;s 400th issue in 2017, Josh Baines of &quot;Noisey&quot; praised the magazine for &quot;examining—in the kind of detail that puts most other publications to shame—sound and music from every conceivable angle&quot; and &quot;treating boundary-pushing music with diligence, care, and above all else, enthusiasm&quot;. The same year, designer Adrian Shaughnessy said that he regarded &quot;The Wire&quot; and the British film magazine &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; as the only two magazines that &quot;remain unmissable&quot;; he said both publications had &quot;serious writing at their core&quot;, which &quot;is never softened to make it &#x27;accessible&#x27; to a wider audience,&quot; and he said both were still &quot;stonking good reads that have introduced me to hours of pleasure that I might otherwise have missed.&quot;

Unfavourable assessments of the magazine have often derided its avant-garde sensibility as pretentious, self-important and inaccessible. Gail Brennan at &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; opined in 1993 that &quot;The Wire&quot; &quot;covers a surprising range of music while bringing a narrow and contrived &#x27;punk&#x27; attitude to bear. Let&#x27;s be blunt. It is a pretentious magazine.&quot; In 1999, &quot;The Wire&quot; was mocked in &quot;The Rock Critical List&quot;, an anonymous zine distributed to newspapers and magazines that ridiculed a number of music journalists, critics and editors. The writer of &quot;The Rock Critical List&quot; had this to say about &quot;The Wire&quot;:

Others within the avant-garde music scene have also criticised &quot;The Wire&quot;. For example Ben Watson, who has contributed to &quot;The Wire&quot; himself, critiqued the magazine&#x27;s editorial approach to covering noise music. In Watson&#x27;s view, the magazine has had a tendency to treat noise musicians&#x27; work as &quot;so worthy, alternative and dis-corporate&quot; that virtually all of it must be inherently meritorious. This tendency results in an institutional reluctance to distinguish between good noise music and mere noise, along with an excess of positive, yet shallow, reviews. Rather than delving deeper into the genre&#x27;s radical political dimensions, Watson argued, &quot;The Wire&quot; has instead curated its noise coverage based on superficial trends of underground fashionability; he suggested that the writing may sometimes provide &quot;a clue as to how some new crew of hopeless hairy Stateside noisemaker muffins have been selected: &#x27;Thurston says they&#x27;re okay...&#x27;.&quot; The magazine&#x27;s writing on noise came to rely on a style of &quot;descriptive objectivity&quot; that studiously avoids any actual evaluation of quality; as Watson wrote,

Watson also recalled bristling at Herrington&#x27;s suggestion to &quot;think niche&quot; when writing for the magazine, which he took as an anti-universalist and commercially motivated attitude.

In a 2007 interview, Herrington addressed the magazine&#x27;s reputation for pondering music that he joked might &quot;sound like a steamroller running over a broken fax machine&quot;, saying: &quot;Most people would out of some bloke making music by bowing away at the femur of a mountain goat, but we&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt.&quot;

== Live events ==
==Books==
There are multiple books based on material first published in &quot;The Wire&quot;. &quot;Invisible Jukebox&quot;(1998), published by Quartet Books, collected entries from the recurring feature of the same name. For these features, an interviewer plays several pieces of music for a musician without identifying them, usually selecting tracks that the musician would be expected to know. The musician is challenged to guess the artist and title, as well as to comment on the music. &quot;Undercurrents: The Hidden Wiring of Modern Music&quot;(2002) was published by Continuum as part of the magazine&#x27;s 20th anniversary; it collected a mix of new and previously published essays about important but overlooked developments in the history of modern music. &quot;The Wire Primers&quot;(2009), out on Verso, collected 19 essays that give introductions to various genres and artists. &quot;Savage Pencil Presents Trip or Squeek&#x27;s Big Amplifier&quot;(2012) collected Savage Pencil cartoons from the preceding twelve years. Most recently, &quot;Epiphanies: Life-changing Encounters With Music&quot;(2015) anthologized essays from a recurring guest column about musical experiences that made a profound impact on the writer.

<doc id="1102464" wikidata="Q576453" url="?curid=1102464" title="Charles Clark (governor)">
<text>Charles Clark (May 24, 1811December 18, 1877) was the 24th governor of Mississippi from 1863 to 1865. A wealthy planter and lawyer, Clark served as a soldier in the Mexican-American War and joined the Confederate army as a general during the American Civil War. Severely wounded in battle, he ran for governor of Mississippi in 1863, serving in office until the final Confederate defeat in the spring of 1865. 

==Early life and education==
Clark was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on May 24, 1811, and subsequently moved to Mississippi. He is the great-grandfather of Judge Charles Clark, who served on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1969 to 1992 and was the chair of the United States Judicial Conference.

In the late 1830s and early 1840s, Clark, a lawyer, represented a settler in a dispute with some Choctaw Native Americans over land in the Mississippi Delta. The dispute led to a series of lawsuits before the Mississippi Supreme Court. The settler ultimately prevailed and gave Clark a large tract of land between Beulah, Mississippi and the Mississippi River as his legal fee. In the late 1840s, Clark formed a plantation on the land, naming it Doe-Roe, pseudonyms commonly used in the legal profession to represent unnamed or unknown litigants (e.g., John Doe, &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;). However, because of poor local literacy, the plantation became known by its phonic representation, &quot;Doro&quot;. According to archives at Delta State University, &quot;The plantation grew to over and became the most prosperous in the region, operating until 1913. It was prominent in the social, political and economic affairs of Bolivar County.&quot; He was also active in state politics, being elected as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives several times.

==Military service==
During the Mexican–American War, he served as a colonel of the 2nd Mississippi Regiment of Volunteers. Following the secession of Mississippi in early 1861, Clark was appointed as a brigadier general in the First Division, First Corps, a Mississippi Militia unit that later entered the Confederate States Army. He commanded the brigade at engagements in Kentucky and then a division under Leonidas Polk at the Battle of Shiloh, where he was slightly wounded. Clark led a division at the Battle of Baton Rouge, where he was severely wounded and captured. He spent time as a prisoner of war before being released, but was permanently disabled. 

==Governor of Mississippi==
John J. Pettus, the governor who led Mississippi to secede in 1861 was term-limited and could not run for reelection. Clark ran for governor in the October 1863 election on a conservative platform focused on caring for wounded soldiers and their families, as opposed to the &quot;fire-eater&quot; rhetoric that had led to secession after Pettus&#x27;s election. Clark was elected as governor with 70% of the vote and inaugurated at Columbus on November 16. The state capital of Jackson had been captured and burned by Union forces earlier that year, and most of the other strategic points in Mississippi were already overrun by US troops by the time Clark took office. 

Clark&#x27;s administration focused on aiding the destitute civilian population of Mississippi, officially sanctioning contraband trade with US forces in exchange for essential goods and medicine. With the collapse of the Confederacy in the spring of 1865, Clark was forcibly removed from office by the United States Army on May 22 and briefly imprisoned at Fort Pulaski near Savannah, Georgia. Clark was replaced as governor by William L. Sharkey, a respected judge and staunch Unionist, who had been in total opposition to secession. 

Clarke was ex officio President of the University of Mississippi Board of Trustees during his tenure as Governor of Mississippi. Despite losing the governorship, he remained on the Board for almost ten years after his term ended. In 1871, he purchased Routhland, an Antebellum mansion in Natchez, Mississippi.

==Death==
Clark died in Bolivar County, Mississippi, on December 18, 1877, and was buried at the family graveyard in that county.

<text>The Académie Colarossi (1870–1930) was an art school in Paris founded in 1870 by the Italian model and sculptor Filippo Colarossi. It was originally located on the Île de la Cité, and it moved in 1879 to 10 rue de la Grande-Chaumière in the 6th arrondissement. The school closed in the 1930s.

== History ==
A precursor art school in the same location was the Académie Suisse, founded in 1815. The former Académie Suisse location on the Île de la Cité was bought by Italian sculptor Filippo Colarossi in 1870, and in 1879 it moved to 10 rue de la Grande-Chaumière in the 6th arrondissement.

The Académie was established in the 19th century as an alternative to the government-sanctioned École des Beaux Arts that had, in the eyes of many promising young artists at the time, become far too conservative. Along with its equivalent Académie Julian, and unlike the official École des Beaux Arts, the Colarossi school accepted female students and allowed them to draw from the nude male model.

Around 1879, two salon painters taught the Académie classes, the Japanese-influenced painter Raphaël Collin and French academic-style painter Gustave Courtois. Among its other instructors were the influential French sculptor, Jean Antoine Injalbert and painter Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret. In 1893, the progressive Académie appointed the American artist Wilhelmina Douglas Hawley (1860–1958) as its first female teacher.

In 1922, sculptor Henry Moore attended, although not as a student. Moore took life-drawing classes that were open to the general public, paid for with a book of inexpensive tickets. The evening classes were progressively timed – one hour, then 20 minutes, then five minutes, then one – to develop various drawing skills.

The school closed in the 1930s. Around that time, Madame Colarossi burned the priceless school archives in retaliation for her husband&#x27;s philandering.

== Notable alumni ==
At Académie Colarossi among the female attendees were german painter Thea Schleusner, Amedeo Modigliani&#x27;s muse, Jeanne Hébuterne; Scottish Impressionist Bessie MacNicol; Canadian Impressionist Emily Carr; and French sculptor Camille Claudel, who was also a student of Rodin&#x27;s. Noted also for its classes in life sculpting, the school attracted many foreign students, including a large number from the United States.

<text>The Kids&#x27; Lit Quiz is an annual literature competition, in which teams of four students, aged 10 to 14, work together to answer wide-ranging literary questions. The winning team from each region competes in the national final. The winner of the national final is then invited to the World Final held annually in July or August. Since its inception in 1991, thousands of students have participated each year throughout the world.

The quiz was created by Wayne Mills, a former educator at the University of Auckland, who wears a purple and black hat while hosting this literary quiz. In 2008 Wayne Mills was given the Storylines Margaret Mahy Medal and Lecture Award to recognize his achievement in establishing the Kids&#x27; Lit Quiz. He was made a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Honours in 2011 for meritorious services to education, specifically children&#x27;s literature. In August 2018 he was granted Life Membership of Storyline&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Literature Trust and Foundation.

In 2003 the quiz was brought to the UK where over 400 schools currently participate in the heats leading to the world final. This pattern is repeated in different countries around the world.

Currently the quiz takes place in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Nigeria, Canada, United States of America, Australia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia and Singapore. Singapore was the first country in Asia to have the quiz.

<text>William McWillie (November 17, 1795 – March 3, 1869) was the twenty-second governor of Mississippi from 1857 to 1859. He was a Democrat.

==Biography==
He was born near Liberty Hill, Kershaw County, South Carolina, on November 17, 1795. His father Colonel Adam McWillie was in command of the 2nd Regiment SC militia during the War of 1812, and William served as an adjutant in his father&#x27;s regiment in the war.

McWillie graduated from South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina) in 1817. He then began the study of law and was admitted to the bar in 1818.

He was married to Nancy Cunningham (1799-1827) and Catherine Anderson (1812–1873), daughter of Dr. Edward H. Anderson of Camden, South Carolina, and granddaughter of a noted officer of the Maryland Line.

Between 1836 and 1840, he served in both the South Carolina House of Representatives and the South Carolina Senate. In 1845 he moved to Mississippi. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1849, serving from December 3, 1849 to March 3, 1851. In 1858 he became Governor of Mississippi, serving until 1860. McWillie died in Kirkwood, Madison County, Mississippi, on March 3, 1869. He is buried in Kirkwood Cemetery, near Camden, Mississippi, the town he founded and named for his hometown of Camden, South Carolina.

His son Adam McWillie (1821 to 1861) was killed in the Civil War during the First Battle of Bull Run.

<doc id="1102494" wikidata="Q3195497" url="?curid=1102494" title="Kerry Collins">
<text>Kerry Michael Collins (born December 30, 1972) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 17 seasons. Collins was a member of six NFL teams, most notably the Carolina Panthers, New York Giants, and Tennessee Titans. He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, winning the Maxwell Award, Davey O&#x27;Brien Award, and Sammy Baugh Trophy in 1994.

Selected by the Panthers fifth overall in the 1995 NFL draft, Collins was the franchise&#x27;s first draft selection. In his second season, he helped the Panthers become the youngest NFL expansion team to clinch their division and appear in a conference championship, also earning him Pro Bowl honors. Collins served as the Giants starting quarterback from 1999 to 2003, leading them to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXV. Following a period of limited success, Collins earned a second Pro Bowl selection after helping the Titans obtain a league-best 13–3 record in 2008. He saw less playing time in his final three years and retired after the 2011 season. Collins was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Early life==
Collins was born in Lebanon, Pennsylvania. He attended Lebanon High School, until 1987, and then transferred to Wilson High School in West Lawn, Pennsylvania, where he played football, basketball, and baseball.

==College career==
Collins attended Pennsylvania State University, where he played for coach Joe Paterno&#x27;s Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1991 to 1994. As a senior quarterback in 1994, he was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, having received first-team honors from the Associated Press, United Press International, &quot;The Football News&quot;, the Football Writers Association of America, the Walter Camp Foundation, and &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Collins also captured two of college football&#x27;s major postseason prizes – the Maxwell Award, presented to the nation&#x27;s outstanding player, and the Davey O&#x27;Brien Award, which goes to the nation&#x27;s top quarterback. Collins finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy balloting that year. He was chosen UPI Back-of-the-Year and garnered Player-of-the-Year honors from ABC-TV/Chevrolet and the Big Ten Conference. Collins made a serious run at the NCAA season passing efficiency record, falling just four points short (172.8), the fourth-highest figure in NCAA annals. He broke Penn State season records for total offense (2,660), completions (176), passing yardage (2,679), completion percentage (66.7), yards per attempt (10.15) and passing efficiency (172.86). He had 14 consecutive completions at Minnesota, another Penn State record. Collins was the linchpin of an explosive offense (including Ki-Jana Carter, Kyle Brady, and Bobby Engram) that shattered 14 school records and led the nation in scoring (47.8 ppg.) and total offense (520.2 ypg.).

With 5,304 career passing yards, Collins ranks third in Penn State annals and is one of only three quarterbacks to top 5,000 yards through the air. With Collins at quarterback, the 1994 Nittany Lions completed an undefeated season, the fifth under coach Joe Paterno, capped by a Rose Bowl win over Pac-10 Champion Oregon. His team was voted #1 by the New York Times, although they were voted #2 behind undefeated Nebraska in the traditional polls (AP Poll and Coaches&#x27; Poll) used to determine Division I-A champions prior to the BCS era. In 2018, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

===College statistics===
==Professional career==
Collins presently ranks 20th all-time in NFL career passing yardage and 19th all-time in NFL career passing completions. His TD:INT ratio and completion percentage were less impressive, however, resulting in passer ratings of 73.8 and 75.3 for the regular season and postseason. He was also less successful in wins and losses, finishing with a .450 regular season winning percentage and a .429 playoff winning percentage. Despite this, he defeated every NFL team except the Miami Dolphins.

===Carolina Panthers===
Collins was selected as the Carolina Panthers&#x27; first round pick (fifth overall) in the 1995 NFL draft. He was the first player ever chosen by the Panthers in the annual college draft, though other players—some free agents, as well as players from the expansion draft—had previously signed with the team. In his three seasons with the Panthers, he threw for 7,295 yards, 39 touchdowns, and 49 interceptions. His completion percentage was 52.6% and his quarterback rating was 65.6. In his second season, he led the Panthers to the NFC Championship, a 30–13 loss to the Green Bay Packers.

Collins threw 21 interceptions during the 1997 season and the Panthers finished 7–9, just one season after advancing to the NFC Championship.

Carolina started the 1998 season with Collins as its starting quarterback. After an 0–4 start, Collins walked into head coach Dom Capers&#x27; office and, as Collins later put it, &quot;told Coach Capers my heart&#x27;s not in it, I&#x27;m not happy, and I don&#x27;t feel like I can play right now.&quot; He asked to be traded, but was instead placed on waivers by Carolina during the 1998 season and subsequently signed with the New Orleans Saints to finish the season.

Collins would later say that he did not intend to quit the Panthers, only to sit out for a few weeks. However, Capers interpreted his request as quitting on the team and he was released. He later admitted that much of his erratic behavior was due to his struggles with alcoholism. After being arrested for drunk driving later that year, he was ordered by the NFL to seek treatment for alcohol abuse.

====Franchise records====
Collins held or shared four Panthers franchise records :
* Passing touchdowns, rookie game (3; with Cam Newton x2)
* Interceptions, season (21 in 1997), rookie season (19; with Chris Weinke), rookie game (4 on 1995-11-12 @STL and 1995-11-26 @NOR; with Chris Weinke and Cam Newton)

===New Orleans Saints===
After signing with the Saints, Collins started the final seven games of the season, but had only two wins. In his lone season with the Saints, Collins threw for 1,202 yards, four touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.

===New York Giants===
Collins started the 1999 season as the Giants&#x27; second-string quarterback behind Kent Graham, but claimed the starting job in Week 11 as Graham struggled with a 5–4 record. In the 2000 season, Collins led the Giants to Super Bowl XXXV, where they lost to the Baltimore Ravens. He went 15-of-39 for 112 yards while throwing for four interceptions, with one being returned for a touchdown. His passer rating of 7.1 is the second worst in Super Bowl history. During the 2001 season, Collins set a single-season NFL record with 23 fumbles, a record tied in 2002 by then-Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper. In 2002, Collins set the Giants&#x27; single season franchise passing record with 4,073 yards; this record was broken by Eli Manning in 2011. After five seasons, 68 starts and 16,875 yards, Collins was released by the Giants in 2004. The team had already signed former league MVP Kurt Warner and traded for 2004&#x27;s #1 draft pick, Eli Manning.

====Franchise records====
, Kerry Collins held at least seven Giants franchise records, including:
* Most Passing Yards (playoff game): 381 (2001-01-14 MIN)
* Most Passing TDs (playoff game): 5 (2001-01-14 MIN)
* Most Intercepted (playoff season): 6 (2000)
* Best Passer Rating (game): 158.3 (2002-12-22 @IND)
* Most Pass Yds/Game (playoff career): 240.0
* Most Pass Yds/Game (playoff season): 342.0 (2002)
* Most 300+ yard passing games (playoffs): two (tied with Eli Manning)

===Oakland Raiders===
After his release from the Giants, Collins signed a three-year, $16.82 million contract with the Oakland Raiders. Collins began the 2004 season as the team&#x27;s backup to Rich Gannon, but took over the starting role when Gannon suffered a neck injury in the third week of the regular season. Collins was the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the 2005 season, subsequent to Gannon&#x27;s retirement.

The 2005 season started off well for Collins, but he was benched after a 34–10 Week 12 loss to the San Diego Chargers. He was replaced by Marques Tuiasosopo. After Tuiasosopo&#x27;s 26–10 loss at the Jets in Week 13, Collins regained his starting job in Week 14 against the Cleveland Browns (a 9–7 loss at home). After two seasons and a 7–21 record with the Raiders, Collins was cut on March 10, 2006, in what was at least partially a move designed to free space with the salary cap.

===Tennessee Titans===
On August 28, 2006, Collins agreed to a one-year contract with the Tennessee Titans. After three games, all losses for the Titans, Collins had completed fewer than half his passes, and had thrown one touchdown and six interceptions. Vince Young, who played extensively as a substitute in the second game, started the fourth through sixth games while Collins saw no playing time in any of them. On March 5, 2007, he re-signed with the Titans.

After Young was injured against Jacksonville on September 7, 2008, Collins finished the game and was named the Titans&#x27; starting quarterback for the rest of 2008, later that week. On September 21, 2008, Collins became the 15th player in NFL history to pass for more than 35,000 yards. Coming into the game against the Houston Texans, Collins needed only 90 yards to eclipse the mark. On his ninth completion of 13 attempts, Collins completed a 17-yard pass to Justin McCareins to give him 107 yards on the day and 35,017 yards for his career.

The Titans finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 13–3, top seed in the playoffs, and a first round bye. In the Divisional Round, they lost to the Baltimore Ravens 13–10. Collins indicated after the season that he would like to play in 2009, but only as a starter. Collins replaced Jets quarterback Brett Favre in the 2009 Pro Bowl, after first alternate Philip Rivers pulled out. He re-signed with the Titans on February 27, 2009. His new contract was worth $15 million, with $8.5 million guaranteed over two years.

Collins returned as the team&#x27;s starting quarterback for the beginning of the 2009 season. In week six, the Titans were defeated by the New England Patriots, 59–0. After that loss and an 0–6 record on the season, coach Jeff Fisher replaced Collins as starting quarterback with Vince Young, three days before the November 1, 2009, game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Fisher stated that he was against this decision, saying that the problems with the team were unrelated to quarterback play, but he made the substitution after being urged by Titans owner Bud Adams to do so. The Titans won five straight games with Young as quarterback, and later finished the season 8–8.

Collins officially announced his retirement from the NFL on July 7, 2011.

===Indianapolis Colts===
On August 24, 2011, Collins decided to forgo his retirement plans and agreed with the Indianapolis Colts on a contract deal. The contract was worth one-year and $4 million. Collins was signed as insurance for Peyton Manning, who was recovering from offseason neck surgery. The Colts named Collins the starter for week one, ending Manning&#x27;s streak of 227 consecutive starts (208 regular season plus 19 playoff games) and making Collins the first quarterback other than Manning to start a regular-season game for the Colts since Jim Harbaugh in week 17 of the 1997 NFL season. On October 25, 2011, the Colts placed Collins on injured reserve due to a concussion, ending his season.

On March 8, 2012, the Colts officially released Collins from their active roster.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Postseason===
==Major League Baseball draft==
Collins was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 26th round of the 1990 MLB draft, but opted to attend Penn State. Detroit selected him in the 60th round of the 1991 amateur draft, but he did not sign with the club. He was again selected in the 48th round of the 1994 amateur draft by the Toronto Blue Jays but again did not sign.

==Personal life==
Collins is married to Brooke Isenhour, whom he met at a George Strait concert in 2000. They have one child, a daughter.

===Battles with alcoholism===

Before the 1997 season got underway, Collins&#x27;s private battle with alcoholism started to make public headlines. In a highly publicized incident, on the last night of Carolina Panthers training camp in 1997, Collins used a racial slur in reference to black teammate Muhsin Muhammad while in a drunken state at a bar in Spartanburg, South Carolina. Supposedly, Collins also inadvertently slurred offensive lineman Norberto Garrido, who is of Hispanic descent. It was widely rumored that Garrido punched Collins in the eye as a result, although this was later proven false.

On November 2, 1998, Collins was arrested for drunk driving in Charlotte, North Carolina. He finished the 1998 season in New Orleans and signed with the New York Giants as a free agent on February 19, 1999. Not long before signing with New York, Collins decided to seek treatment for his alcoholism. He entered a rehabilitation clinic in Topeka, Kansas.

While a member of the New York Giants, Collins remained in therapy for four years. As a member of the Tennessee Titans, he readdressed the 1997 racial slur incident, explaining that &quot;The guys were talking to each other that way, and I was trying to be funny and thought I could do it, too. I was so upset by it. It was bad judgment. I could have been labeled a racist for the rest of my career. I had to live with the way I used that word with a teammate. Extremely poor judgment. I was naïve to think I could use that word in any context.&quot;

<text>Nansi Richards Jones (14 May 1888 – 21 December 1979) was a Welsh harpist, sometimes known as the &quot;Queen of the Harp&quot; or by her bardic name &quot;Telynores Maldwyn&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Jane Ann &quot;Nansi&quot; Richards was born at Pen-y-bont-fawr, Montgomeryshire. An expert on both the triple and pedal harps, she always maintained that the greatest influences on her life were her father Thomas Richards, the Kale (Welsh Roma) who stayed on their farm, and Tom Lloyd (Telynor Ceiriog, 1848–1917), who taught her to play the harp. She also studied at the Guildhall School of Music in London, with harpist John Thomas.

==Musical career==
She won the National Eisteddfod harp competition three times in succession. After a year at the Guildhall School of Music, she toured with American comedian &quot;Happy&quot; Fanny Fields. The two young women devised tricks for Nansi to do while playing the harp, such as playing with her back turned, or playing two harps simultaneously.

Richards was appointed Royal Harpist to the Prince of Wales in 1911, a title she held until her death; the role remained vacant until it was reinstated in 2000. She was awarded the MBE in 1967. In 1972 she published an autobiography &quot;Cwpwrdd Nansi&quot;.

Richards is credited as teaching traditional triple-harp technique to several musicians, including entertainer Ryan Davies, Dafydd and Gwyndaf Roberts of the folk band Ar Log, and triple harpist Llio Rydderch.

==Kellogg&#x27;s cockerel==
A frequently told, but possibly apocryphal, story about Richards involves one of Richards&#x27; overseas trips, when she visited the home of corn flakes manufacturer Will Kellogg, who was looking for a marketing idea. Richards suggested the cockerel (later named Cornelius Rooster), inspired by a pun on the name Kellogg and the Welsh word &quot;ceiliog&quot;, meaning &quot;cockerel&quot;.

==Personal life and legacy==
in 1928 Nansi Richards married Cecil Maurice Jones (1902–1963); they settled in Tremadog. She spent her last years in Parc, Cecil&#x27;s home village near Bala. She died late in 1979, age 91. Her remains were buried in the churchyard at St Melangell&#x27;s Church, Pennant Melangell near Llangynog.

There is an annual Nansi Richards Harp Scholarship competition for young harpists.

A recording of Nansi Richards playing &quot;Pen Rhaw&quot; was included on the 2000 album &quot;The Rough Guide to Music of Wales.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;Nansi&quot;, a play about the life of Nansi Richards, written by Angharad Price, was staged by Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru at the National Eisteddfod.

<doc id="1102498" wikidata="Q973054" url="?curid=1102498" title="Rakuten">
<text>is a Japanese technology conglomerate based in Tokyo, founded by Hiroshi Mikitani in 1997. Centered around the online retail marketplace Rakuten Ichiba, its businesses include financial services utilizing Fintech, digital content and communications services such as the messaging app Viber, e-book distributor Kobo, and Japan&#x27;s fourth-most used mobile carrier, Rakuten Mobile. Rakuten has more than 28,000 employees worldwide, operating in 30 countries and regions, and its revenues totalling US $12.8 billion as of 2021. Rakuten was the official sponsor of the Spanish football club FC Barcelona from 2017 until 2022, and the Golden State Warriors of the NBA as of 2022. It is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Amazon of Japan&quot;.

Some past significant investments include Buy.com (now Rakuten.com in the US), Priceminister (France, now Rakuten.fr), Ikeda, Tradoria, Play.com, Wuaki.tv, Pinterest, Ebates, Viki, The Grommet. The company also holds and has held stakes in Ozon.ru, AHA Life, Lyft, Cabify, Careem, Carousell and Acorns.

==History==
===Early years (1997–1999)===

Rakuten was founded as MDM, Inc. by Hiroshi Mikitani on 7 February 1997. The online shopping marketplace was officially launched on May 1, 1997. The company had six employees and the website had 13 merchants.

The name was changed to Rakuten in June 1999. The Japanese word means &#x27;optimism&#x27;.

Harvard-educated former banker Mikitani envisioned the site as an online shopping mall, offering the opposite of what the larger companies like IBM were trying to do with similar services, by offering empowerment to merchants rather than trying to tightly control the virtual storefront. The service was offered for a smaller fee than the larger Internet malls were charging, and merchants were given more control, such as the ability to customize their storefronts on the site.

===2000s===
The company went public through an IPO on the JASDAQ market on April 19, 2000. At the time, the online marketplace had 2,300 stores and 95 million page views per month, making it one of the most popular sites in Japan.

In March 2001, the online hotel reservation service Rakuten Travel was launched.

In April 2002, a new system was introduced for merchants, combining monthly fixed fees with commissions on sales. That November, the Rakuten Super Point Program, a membership loyalty program, was introduced.

In September 2004, Rakuten grew its financial services businesses by acquiring consumer finance company Aozora Card Co., Ltd., later renaming it Rakuten Card Co., Ltd. The company began offering a Rakuten credit card in 2005. By November 2016, the Rakuten card was held by over 13 million people, and nearly 40% of Rakuten&#x27;s revenue was from financial services, as it was operating Japan&#x27;s largest Internet bank and third-largest credit company. Rakuten card holders are part of a point-based membership programme and can use those points to make purchases on the Internet mall. In 2016, the company introduced Rakuten Pay, an app-based smartphone payment system.

In October 2004, Rakuten Baseball was created, and the baseball team Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles was formed and joined Nippon Professional Baseball.

In 2005, Rakuten started expanding outside Japan, mainly through acquisitions and joint ventures.

In December 2005, Rakuten established the Rakuten Institute of Technology in Tokyo as its department in charge of research and development.

In a joint venture in February 2008, Rakuten and President Chain Store established Rakuten&#x27;s first e-commerce site outside of Japan with Rakuten Ichiba Taiwan.

===2010s===
Around 2011, Rakuten started heavily expanding outside of Japan, with prominent moves including a stake in Canadian e-book maker Kobo Inc. and an investment in Pinterest.

In 2011, Rakuten launched Indonesia&#x27;s Rakuten Belanja Online.

By late 2012, Rakuten had moved into online retail in Austria, Canada, Spain, Taiwan and Thailand and the online travel markets in France—with Voyager Moins Cher.com—and China, Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan—with its Tokyo-based international Rakuten Travel platform. In North America, Rakuten Golf made booking tee times online possible. To increase its global competitiveness, and to better incorporate non-Japanese speakers, Rakuten decided to adopt English as the company&#x27;s official language starting in 2012. By 2016, nearly 40% of the company&#x27;s engineers in Japan were non-Japanese.

In September 2014, Rakuten bought Ebates for $1 billion to enter online shopping membership rewards in Canada, China, Russia, South Korea, and the United States.

In January 2015, Rakuten entered the sport of football by acquiring Vissel Kobe, a top J1 League team formed in 1995.

In March 2015, Rakuten announced that it would begin accepting Bitcoin across its global marketplaces, shortly after investing in San Francisco–based Bitcoin payments-processing startup Bitnet Technologies. Rakuten has been a strong supporter of Bitcoin&#x27;s potential and was one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin for payment. In 2015, Rakuten relocated its corporate headquarters from Shinagawa to the Tamagawa neighbourhood of Setagaya-ku, to consolidate its Tokyo offices and to accommodate future growth.

In 2016, Rakuten shut down retailing websites in the UK, Spain, Austria, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. In that year, the company lost its long status as the largest e-commerce site in Japan to Amazon Japan.

On November 16, 2016, Rakuten announced it had agreed to a four-year partnership with the La Liga football club FC Barcelona, one of the most successful football teams in Europe. The agreement would see Rakuten become FC Barcelona&#x27;s main global partner beginning with the 2017-18 season, with its name appearing on match-day jerseys. The deal was worth at least €220 million and includes an option for a one-year extension.

In February 2017, Ebates and Rakuten acquired Shopstyle and its influencer marketing group, Collective, to extend into fashion curation, discovery and product search.

Rakuten partnered with California-based Blackstorm Labs to launch an online social gaming platform called R Games in April 2017, going live with 15 free games optimized for smartphones, including &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. The games are based on HTML5, which can be played across any device and on any platform, and Rakuten will tap into its worldwide database of 114 million online shoppers. Rakuten plans to integrate R Games into its messaging app Viber.

In September 2017, Rakuten signed a three-year, $60 million deal to become the official sponsor for the jersey patch on the front of the uniforms for the Golden State Warriors of the NBA.

Rakuten partnered with Walmart for a late push on e-books in January 2018. The company announced plans to launch its cryptocurrency in March. In May 2018, Rakuten announced the fourth wireless mobile network in Japan, named Rakuten Mobile.

In June 2018 Ebates and Rakuten acquired Curbside to accelerate its online-to-offline offering to members and merchants.

In September 2019, negotiations successfully closed to acquire the Taiwanese baseball team, the Lamigo Monkeys. With the sale, Rakuten became the first foreign company to own a Chinese Professional Baseball League team. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The team name was formally changed to the Rakuten Monkeys on 17 December 2019. New uniforms, similar in design to those of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles were released.

===2020s===

In July 2020, Rakuten announced that it would be closing its online shop/marketplace in the United States, which formerly went under the name Buy.com. The marketplace closed to new orders on 15 September and shut down after all remaining orders had been fulfilled.

In September 2020, Rakuten launched its wireless carrier service&#x27;s 5G network in some areas of Japan after it started 4G services in April. The company named its network technology the Rakuten Communications Platform (RCP) which makes use of cloud computing to lower the price and started sales activity abroad, gaining at least fifteen international customers by the spring of 2021.

On September 24, 2020, Rakuten announced that they would shut down their online marketplace in Germany. As of October 15, 2020, they no longer accept new orders while all orders before that date were to be fulfilled.

In March 2021, Rakuten announced at a joint press conference attended by CEO Mikitani and the President of Japan Post Holdings that Rakuten would allot more than 8 per cent stake to Japan Post Holdings for 150 billion yen, accepting Japan Post Holdings as the third-largest shareholder after the Mikitani family in the first-ever major capital tie-up for Rakuten, to be financially equipped to spend billions on installing telecommunications infrastructure across Japan in competition with rival Amazon Japan. Tencent and Walmart, the previous owners of Seiyu Group, now partially owned by Rakuten, also took stakes of 3.65% and 0.9% respectively.

In February 2022, Rakuten founder Hiroshi Mikitani donated ¥1 billion ($8.7 million) to humanitarian actions in Ukraine amid the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In 2023, Rakuten partnered with Supermicro on high-performing Open RAN technologies and storage systems for operators of cloud-based mobile services.

== Criticism ==
=== Corporate culture ===
In 2010, the founder and CEO, Hiroshi Mikitani, mandated that all business, from official meetings to internal emails, be written in English. Corporate officers that do not become proficient in English in two years were to be fired. At the time, only an estimated 10% of the Japanese staff could function in English, with the mandate facing criticism from other CEOs at the time.

Rakuten introduced the English-only policy, dubbed &quot;Englishnization,&quot; as part of Mr Mikitani&#x27;s push to &quot;globalize&quot; the company and its employees.

The new policy resulted in the resignation of some staff. Eventually, Rakuten decided to provide free English classes, offered time to study, and made clear that learning English was a part of employees&#x27; jobs. In light of Japan ranking 14th globally with &quot;moderate proficiency&quot; in the global English Proficiency Index behind South Korea and ahead of Portugal, it also introduced difficulty in hiring staff with both Japanese and English skills.

While claiming it a success in 2012, it was not until 2015 that the average employee score on the Test of English for International Communication, or TOEIC, reached 802.6 out of a possible 990 points. A score above 800 indicates advanced proficiency.

TOEIC does face criticism, though, concerning its validity.

An example of official meetings held in English is &quot;Asakai&quot;. It is a morning company-wide meeting that started on Saturdays but is now on Monday mornings at 8:00 am (JST).

=== Disabling product reviews ===
On July 17 2012, the Kobo Touch eReader was launched in Japan to widespread criticism. The client app and networking were inoperational and devices could not be activated after purchase. A wave of 1-star reviews on Rakuten such as &quot;my expectations were betrayed&quot; were posted by angry consumers, after which the company disabled product reviews for the first time in its history. A Rakuten spokesman stated &quot;In order to avoid confusion we will re-enable reviews after this issue is resolved. We do not plan to delete negative reviews. As a special case out of special cases, it was unavoidable that we took this action.&quot; However in opposition on July 27 CEO Hiroshi Mikitani later stated &quot;Bad feedback is misinformation so we&#x27;ll remove them and reinstate them after close review.&quot;

=== e-book advertising ===
On July 19 2012, the Kobo e-bookstore launched. Advertising pamphlets for the Kobo Touch claimed a library of 30,000 Japanese titles when in reality only 19,164 were available. On July 27 2012, after criticism about Kobo&#x27;s available book selection, Mikitani vowed to &quot;exceed 30,000 (books) within July&quot; and &quot;make 60,000 available by August.&quot; In reality, those marks were met on August 27 and September 24, respectively. In response, the Consumer Affairs Agency stated that Mikitani&#x27;s promises and company marketing violated product misrepresentation laws and exerted pressure on the company. Rakuten issued an apology shortly after. The Kobo e-bookstore also included a repackaged version of 500 Wikipedia articles with a new ISBN in violation of Creative Commons license standards. Mikitani&#x27;s tweet announcing its inclusion attracted criticism on the internet. The ISBN was later changed to a product code and the DRM was removed.

=== Price hiking ===
On 3 2014 it was reported that Rakuten was ordering vendors to artificially hike the MSRP of items. During sales e-commerce consultants reported that high numbers of consumers took advantage of sales and coupons. In turn, they recommended &quot;multiply the MSRP&quot; and have a 50% off sale to appeal to consumers. A drinks vendor was reportedly told to hike prices by 5x. Dummy product pages with inflated MSRP&#x27;s were found to have passed Rakuten&#x27;s inspection, hypothetically clearing it to be listed for sale. The Consumer Affairs Agency stated company practices violated product misrepresentation laws and requested the prevention of further incidents. Rakuten later issued an apology.

On 11/3 2017 to commemorate a Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles championship win Rakuten initiated a site-wide sale, with some vendors advertising 77% off their products. The company had claimed the sale would be a heavy financial burden but would consider it a &quot;marketing cost.&quot; By 11/7 2013, it was revealed that 20 vendors and up to 1000 products were implicated in artificial price hikes. Products included iPhone 4S whose pre-sale price was listed as 43,3915 yen. A 10-pack of cream puffs previously sold for 2525 yen was advertised as 12,000 yen but 77% off (2500 yen). Under Consumer Affairs Agency standards such pricing was illegal. Rakuten initially denied liability and stated it was the actions of individual vendors but 3 of the 20 who had hiked prices were revealed to have received checks and approval from Rakuten employees. 17 out of the 20 offending vendors were given 1-month suspensions. They however remained anonymous and when asked if Rakuten would name vendors Mikitani stated, &quot;1 month of suspension is too strict (for sellers) We&#x27;re not the police and we think we do not have that right&quot; 18 Rakuten employees were later revealed to have pressed the idea of inflated prices to vendors. The company issued an apology and vowed to create a monitoring team to prevent similar incidents.

=== Sale of ivory===

In March 2014, the UK-based Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) named the company as the world&#x27;s biggest online retailer of whale meat and elephant ivory, calling on the company to stop selling the items. As a result of this, in April 2014, Rakuten announced that it was ending all online sales of whale and dolphin meat by the end of the month. In July 2017, Rakuten announced that it was also banning ivory sales on its sites.

==Recognition and awards==
Rakuten partnered with Stephen Curry in 2023 on a one-day shopping spree at the Warriors Shop in Chase Center for twenty Bay Area children. Curry posed as a team shop employee during the event and helped find sports gear around the store.

<text>Albert Gleaves (January 1, 1858 – January 6, 1937) was a decorated admiral in the United States Navy, also notable as a naval historian.

==Biography==
Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Gleaves graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1877. After serving on board and , he was appointed an Ensign in 1881. Assigned to many ships and stations, he commanded during the Spanish–American War and later the battleship . Promoted to rear admiral in 1915, in World War I he commanded the Cruiser and Transport Force. For his outstanding contribution he was awarded the Army and Navy Distinguished Service Medals.

In 1919 he was promoted to Admiral and commanded the Asiatic Fleet. While serving at the Naval Ordnance Proving Ground, Admiral Gleaves made outstanding contributions in the field of gunnery and torpedoes. While carrying out some tests on torpedo steering devices he changed these weapons from instruments of luck into instruments of precision. The gear which he tested in &quot;Cushing&quot; provided the imprints which made the torpedo the &quot;terrible weapon&quot; of World War I.

In spite of a life of constant action in war and peace, he found time to write a biography of Captain James Lawrence; &quot;A History of the Transport Service&quot;, and &quot;The Life of an American Sailor: Rear Admiral William Hemsley Emory, United States Navy, from His Letters and Memoirs&quot;. After a most distinguished career, he retired on January 1, 1922.

He was a companion of the Naval Order of the United States and was assigned insignia number 756.

Admiral Gleaves died at Haverford, Pennsylvania, January 6, 1937, a few days after his 79th birthday.

He has been quoted as saying, &quot;To seamen a ship becomes endowed with human virtues and faults; she ceases to be a mere inanimate thing.&quot;

There was a statue of Admiral Gleaves at the State Capitol in Nashville, Tennessee. The statue was moved to the Tennessee State Museum to be included in a military exhibit.

<doc id="1102508" wikidata="Q3768575" url="?curid=1102508" title="Girard College">
<text>Girard College is an independent college preparatory five-day boarding school located on a 43-acre campus in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The school was founded and permanently endowed from the shipping and banking fortune of Stephen Girard upon his death in 1831.

==Stephen Girard&#x27;s legacy==
Born in the seaport city of Bordeaux, France, in 1750, Stephen Girard arrived in the city of Philadelphia, in May 1776, during the momentous summer of the American Revolutionary War and remained there for the rest of his life. During his 55 years in the city, he became the wealthiest American of his time and the fourth wealthiest American of all time, adjusted for today&#x27;s dollars.

With the assistance of noted attorney William J. Duane (1780–1865), in the 1820s, he wrote a long will and testament, outlining every detail of how his fortune would be used. Immediately after he died in 1831, the provisions of his will were made public. In addition to extensive personal and institutional bequests, he left the bulk of his fortune to the city of Philadelphia to build and operate a residential school. The bequest was the largest single act of philanthropy up to that time in American history.

The Girard Estate remains open in perpetuity. Its endowment and financial resources are held in trust by the courts of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which provides much of the school&#x27;s operating budget.

==History==
Girard College was founded in 1833, three years before the establishment of the Central High School of Philadelphia. Both schools, along with Girls&#x27; High, acted as a type of &quot;magnet school&quot; type, with college prep/academic curricula, strict admission standards, with noted faculty and famous alumni with respected roles.

The buildings and classrooms for Girard took some time to design and construct with their expensive &quot;Greek Revival&quot; stone architecture, with monolithic columns, but were ready and opened on January 1, 1848, under provisions of Girard&#x27;s will supervised by the appointed trustees, including banker and financier Nicholas Biddle, (1786–1844).

Girard&#x27;s vision for the school can best be understood in the context of early 19th Century Philadelphia. The city was then at the forefront of creating innovative American institutions designed to solve a specific social challenge, such as the newly founded and constructed Eastern State Penitentiary (humane incarceration), the Pennsylvania Hospital (mental illness), the Pennsylvania Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb (disabilities), and the Franklin Institute (scientific knowledge). Girard chose to dedicate his immense fortune to helping educate young men of Philadelphia as Americans for the future.

Girard&#x27;s will stipulated that students at Girard College must be &quot;poor, white, male, orphans&quot;. For over a century, the school remained exclusive to orphaned white boys. However, in 1831, a mother who became a widow had no rights and resources, and &quot;guardians&quot; were often appointed by the &quot;Probate&quot; or &quot;Orphan courts&quot; of the city and state. Girard operated as a school for fatherless boys rather than children with no living parents or guardians. (The college in the 19th Century determined the legal definition of the term &quot;orphan&quot; was &quot;a fatherless child&quot;.)

From May 1954, with the U. S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, there was increasing pressure on Girard College to accept racial integration, as the city&#x27;s public schools had long been. After an extended, bitter, 14-year civil-rights struggle led by Cecil B. Mooreincluding Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s August 1965 address to a crowd outside Girard&#x27;s front gates (&quot;[&quot;Philadelphia,&quot;] the cradle of liberty, that has ... a kind of Berlin Wall to keep the colored children of God out&quot;) the first four black boys entered the school in September 1968.

Not part of the School District of Philadelphia, which had long been racially integrated (as being in a northern, formerly &quot;free state&quot;), Girard College was still considered &quot;private&quot; even though it had a very public educational mission and was racially segregated long before the consideration of the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; legal case. Girard College was ordered to desegregate by the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 unanimous decision. Perhaps the key to the ruling was that Girard, following its founder&#x27;s will, was administered by the &quot;Board of Directors of City Trusts&quot;, and that public institution could not continue to maintain the historically outdated entrance requirement.

For fourteen years, the legal battle to desegregate Girard College continued. Beginning on May 1, Cecil B. Moore and the Philadelphia Freedom Fighters marched around the wall encompassing the campus for seven months in 1965. The initial pickets were met with strong resistance, directed by police chief Frank Rizzo. On the first day, 1,000 police officers lined the walls of the college. The police used repressive tactics toward the protests including motorcycle and foot charges into the crowds and arrests, beginning on May 5. Stanley Branche and seven other members of the Black Coalition Movement were arrested when they attempted to scale the walls. A highlight of these protests came on August 2 of that year when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to the front gates of Girard&#x27;s campus and addressed the protesters.

The first four African-American male students were finally admitted on September 11, 1968.

Sixteen years later, the policy of an all-male student body was also changed, and the first girls were admitted in 1984. The first female student was admitted as a first grader in 1984, following more adjustments to the admission criteria so that the death of a father was no longer required. Girls were gradually integrated into the college over a 12-year enrollment period, with subsequent new female students only permitted to enroll in the same graduating class as the first female student or a younger class. The first young women graduated with a Girard diploma in 1993. The graduating class of 1996 was the first class to graduate with more female students than males, although it remains more or less balanced yearly. Current enrollment of Girard College in the 21st century is about evenly divided between boys and girls and about 90% African-American.

In May 2009 Girard College named Autumn Adkins as its 16th president, the first female chief administrator in its (then) 160-year existence. Adkins, now Autumn Adkins Graves, was not only the first woman but also the first African-American to head the college. Adkins resigned in 2012.

Following Adkins, Clarence D. Armbrister was the first African-American man to serve in this role. He was succeeded in 2018 by David P. Hardy.

==Program==

All students live in single-sex dormitories arranged by grade level. Residential advisors occupy apartments in the dorm buildings. Girard requires that all students participate in the five-day program. All students go home on weekends. Girard is open to students of all religious backgrounds. Once a month at the beginning of the school day, however, all students attend a non-denominational assembly in the school&#x27;s chapel. The chapel has a large pipe organ, designed and built by Ernest M. Skinner in 1933. The instrument is used for occasional concerts and has been recorded by such organists as Virgil Fox and Carlo Curley, who was director of music at Girard College in 1970 when he was 18 years old.

Entering 2016, enrollment at Girard was projected to be 311; of these, 122 were Elementary School students (grades 1 to 5), 89 were Middle Schoolers, and 100 attended High School (grades 9 to 12). Girard employs 127 faculty members, of whom 71 are academic teachers and 56 are residential advisers. Class sizes range between 12 and 20 students in the elementary school and 16-22 students in the middle school. In the high school, honors classes have 15 students, and other classes 20 to 25 students.

==Founder&#x27;s Hall==

Founder&#x27;s Hall at Girard College (1833–1847) is considered one of the finest examples of American Greek Revival architecture, for which it is designated a National Historic Landmark. School founder Girard specified in his will the dimensions and plan of the building. Nicholas Biddle (1786–1844) was chairman of the School&#x27;s building committee, banker and financier, and president of the later revived and reorganized Second Bank of the United States in Philadelphia.

Girard&#x27;s will demanded an architectural competition for the school&#x27;s design. Endowed with his $2-million contribution, the 1832 competition was the first American architectural competition to participate nationally. The winning architect was Thomas Ustick Walter (1804–1887). After the Girard commission, Walter designed the dome of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. He returned to Philadelphia and became an assistant architect on the City Hall and, in 1857, a founding member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA).

Founder&#x27;s Hall was the school&#x27;s original classroom building. It has three main floors, each measuring . The plan for each floor, according to Stephen Girard&#x27;s specifications, consists of a front hall, four 50 ft. square rooms with 25 ft. ceilings arranged two-by-two, and a back hall the same size as the front hall. The scale of the spaces was impressively large when the building first opened.

Resulting from his association with architect Walter, Nicholas Biddle hired him in 1834 to convert the Biddle country seat, Andalusia, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, from a large Pennsylvania farmhouse into an exemplary domestic Greek-Revival structure.

<text>The Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad was a class II railroad that operates in northwestern Pennsylvania and northeastern Ohio.

The railroad&#x27;s main route runs from the Lake Erie port of Conneaut, Ohio, to the Pittsburgh suburb of Penn Hills, Pennsylvania, a distance of . The original rail ancestor of the B&amp;LE, the Shenango and Allegheny Railroad, began operation in October 1869.

Rail operations were maintained continuously by various corporate descendants on the growing system that ultimately became the BLE in 1900. In 2004 BLE came under the ownership of the Canadian National Railway (CN) as part of CN&#x27;s larger purchase of holding company Great Lakes Transportation. BLE is operated by CN as their Bessemer Subdivision. As a subsidiary of CN, BLE has been largely unchanged (though repainting of BLE locomotives into CN paint with &quot;BLE&quot; sub-lettering began in April 2015) and still does business as BLE. BLE locomotives, especially the former Southern Pacific SD40T-3 &quot;Tunnel Motors&quot;, have been scattered across the CN system; many are being used in the line that feeds most of BLE&#x27;s traffic, the former Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range lines in Minnesota. The iron ore that originates on these lines is transloaded to ships at Two Harbors, Minnesota, then sent by ship to Conneaut, Ohio, where it is again transloaded to BLE trains. It is then taken down to steel mills in the Pittsburgh region, mainly to the blast furnaces at US Steel&#x27;s Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania, part of the Mon Valley Works.

==History==

The Pittsburgh, Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad Company was founded in 1897 by Andrew Carnegie to haul iron ore and other products from the port at Conneaut, Ohio, on the Great Lakes to Carnegie Steel Company plants in Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. On the return trip, Pennsylvania coal was hauled north to Conneaut Harbor. The company was created largely out of a series of small predecessor companies including the Pittsburgh, Shenango and Lake Erie Railroad, and the Butler and Pittsburgh Railroad Company. The company was renamed the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad in 1900. Carnegie Steel had an exclusive 99-year lease to the PS&amp;LE. This lease was acquired by US Steel when that company acquired Carnegie Steel in 1901.

At the end of 1925 B&amp;LE operated 228 miles of road on 631 miles of track; at the end of 1970 mileages were 220 and 489.

In 1988 the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad became part of Transtar, Inc., a privately held transportation holding company with principal operations in railroad freight transportation, dock operations, Great Lakes shipping, and inland river barging that were formerly subsidiaries of USX, the holding company that owns U.S. Steel. In 2001 the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad became part of Great Lakes Transportation, LLC. On May 10, 2004 Canadian National Railway acquired the Bessemer and Lake Erie Railroad. Iron ore and coal are still the route&#x27;s major freight commodities.

==Route notes==

The B&amp;LE connects with the Norfolk Southern Railway at Wallace Junction, near Girard, Pennsylvania, and at the Shenango Yard in Greenville, Pennsylvania. The Union Railroad connects at the B&amp;LE&#x27;s southern terminus at Penn Hills&#x27; North Bessemer Yard. CSX (formerly the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad) connects at Shenango Yard (the Pennsylvania Railroad may have connected here, too), and the Buffalo and Pittsburgh Railroad connects at Calvin Yard in Butler, Pennsylvania. The B&amp;LE formerly interchanged at Osgood, Pennsylvania with the New York Central System, later Penn Central Railroad and then Conrail, until the latter abandoned the line in 1988.

The main rail yard and locomotive and car shops are in Greenville, Pennsylvania. Although the B&amp;LE acquired some early diesel-electric switching locomotives painted black with yellow trim, in 1950 the company adopted a locomotive color scheme of bright orange and black which is still in use. Because the B&amp;LE&#x27;s primary traffic is iron ore, it adopted rust-colored hoppers so the ore wouldn&#x27;t produce noticeable stains on its cars.
The B&amp;LE also saw passenger traffic, and maintained a spur line from its main line east to Conneaut Lake Park amusement park for dropping off and picking up excursionists visiting the park.

The B&amp;LE main line divides around Greenville, between a waypoint north of the village of Osgood called &#x27;KO&#x27; and another waypoint near the village of Kremis that used the telegraph call name &#x27;KY&#x27;, for the &quot;Osgood-Kremis&quot; cut-off (&quot;K-O&quot;) that joined the original &quot;Old Line&quot; there. The latter still winds down along the Little Shenango and Shenango Rivers into downtown Greenville (where the B&amp;LE shops are located), and then climbs back up to Kremis, en route to Fredonia and North Bessemer. The B&amp;LE constructed the shortcut K-O Line in 1901–02 to bypass the steep, winding route through Greenville. From &#x27;KO Junction&#x27;, it runs south over a long () viaduct above the Little Shenango River, the original B&amp;LE Old Line, the former NYC RR&#x27;s JF&amp;C Branch and the former Erie RR&#x27;s Chicago—New York main line at Osgood. It then passes east of downtown Greenville at a relatively high elevation, and rejoins the original line at KY, near Kremis. The K-O Line cut-off shortened KO to KY run by 3.1 miles vs. the Old Line. Except for the Osgood Viaduct, this cut-off was double-tracked for many years but, since the arrival of CTC signaling in the 1950s, is now entirely single track.

The B&amp;LE operated a line from Queen Junction (near Butler, Pennsylvania) to Brady&#x27;s Bend, Pennsylvania. It was known as the Western Allegheny Division, and was notable for being the last line that the B&amp;LE&#x27;s F-Units ran on. F-unit service on the line ended in 1992, and the last train, which was pulled by an EMD SD9 ran in November 1994. The line sat out of service until 2000, when it was abandoned. The tracks were removed in 2002, and today, the right of way is barely visible.

There was originally one tunnel on the B&amp;LE mainline at Culmerville, but it was dug out or &quot;daylighted&quot; in 1922, converting it to an open cut through a hill.

As it approaches North Bessemer, the B&amp;LE is also noticeable where it crosses the Allegheny River on the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Bridge immediately east of and parallel to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

==Locomotives==

In the steam era, B&amp;LE had a fleet of 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; types, classes C1 through C4; 2-10-2 &quot;Santa Fe&quot; types, classes D1 and D2; and 2-10-4 &quot;Texas&quot; type locomotives, class H1. The H1 locomotives were one of the most powerful non-articulated locomotives ever constructed. The B&amp;LE also had a number of switchers, including 0-6-0s and 0-8-0s. Two steam locomotives from the B&amp;LE have been preserved, which are 2-10-4 No. 643 and 2-8-0 No. 154. The road was dieselized in 1953. In the diesel era, B&amp;LE&#x27;s motive power has always been mostly Electro-Motive Division. It dieselized with many EMD F-units, which were supplemented by SD9s, SD18s, and ALCo RSD15s. Later, it bought a number of EMD SD38ACs and SD38-2s to replace the F-units. In the late 1990s, it bought many EMD SD40T-3 &quot;Tunnel Motors&quot; from Southern Pacific Railroad to replace the 1950s-vintage SD9s.

As a subsidiary of CN, the B&amp;LE has been largely unchanged (though repainting of B&amp;LE locomotives into CN paint with &quot;BLE&quot; sub-lettering began in April 2015). Bessemer and Lake Erie&#x27;s locomotives, especially the SD40T-3 &quot;Tunnel Motors,&quot; have been scattered across the CN system in the mid-late 2000s with the majority leaving the B&amp;LE Property in March 2015. Many of these SD40T-3s are being used on the line that feeds most of B&amp;LE&#x27;s traffic, the former Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range Railroad in Minnesota. The iron ore that originates on these lines is transloaded to ships at Two Harbors, Minnesota; then sent by ship to Conneaut, Ohio, where it is again transloaded to B&amp;LE trains. It is then taken down to steel mills in the Pittsburgh area, mainly to the blast furnaces at US Steel&#x27;s Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania, part of the Mon Valley Works. As of October 2022, the locomotives on the Bessemer include a set of 3 or 4 CN EMD SD70M-2s (CN 8800, 8804, 8827, 8876, and 8907 are currently on the property) for ore trains. B&amp;LE Tunnel Motor 905, B&amp;LE SD38AC 868, and B&amp;LE SD38 862 (painted in the Duluth, Missabe, and Iron Range Railroad scheme) are kept on the line for use on locals, and rare appearances on the ore trains. 868 previously operated at the docks in Conneaut until the loop track was put back in place around 2020.

<text>Quinella is the tenth album by American Southern rock band Atlanta Rhythm Section, and their only album on Columbia Records, released in August 1981. The band was supposed to release another album on the label, but due to differences between Columbia and the band, the album was shelved.

The album peaked at #70 on the Billboard 200. Its only single, &quot;Alien&quot;, peaked at #29 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming their final Top 40 hit.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Boston Globe&quot; wrote: &quot;As always, there is an abundance of sinewy, unabrasive guitars, smooth backup harmonies, and a soft punctuating bottom, all in a conservative tempo. But the style is so hygienic the album is difficult to get excited about.&quot;

<text>Pascale Marguerite Cécile Claude Colette Nicolas (26 October 1958 – 25 October 1984), better known as Pascale Ogier, was a French actress. She won the Volpi Cup, and posthumously received a César Award nomination for her role in the 1984 film &quot;Full Moon in Paris&quot;.

== Biography ==
Ogier was born as Pascale Marguerite Cécile Claude Colette Nicolas in Paris on 26 October 1958. She was the daughter of actress Bulle Ogier and musician Gilles Nicolas. Ogier also chose an acting career, first with appearances on stage. In 1982, she and her mother co-wrote the screenplay and starred in director Jacques Rivette&#x27;s film &quot;Le Pont du Nord&quot;.

For her performance in director Éric Rohmer&#x27;s film &quot;Full Moon in Paris&quot;, Ogier was nominated for a César Award for Best Actress at the 10th César Awards and won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 41st Venice International Film Festival. Shortly afterwards, on the day before she was to celebrate her 26th birthday, Ogier died of a heart attack probably caused by a heart murmur condition she had since age 12, combined with drug use.

Ogier is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. The film &quot;Down by Law&quot; (1986) is dedicated to her.

<text>A value judgment (or normative judgement) is a judgment of the rightness or wrongness of something or someone, or of the usefulness of something or someone, based on a comparison or other relativity. As a generalization, a value judgment can refer to a judgment based upon a particular set of values or on a particular value system. A related meaning of value judgment is an expedient evaluation based upon limited information at hand, where said evaluation was undertaken because a decision had to be made on short notice. Judgmentalism may refer to an overly critical or moralistic attitude or behaviour.

==Explanation==
A &quot;value judgment&quot; is a thought about something based on what it &quot;ought&quot; or &quot;should&quot; be given an opinion about what counts as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; — a contrast from a thought based on what the facts are. E.g. &quot;The government should improve access to education&quot; is a value judgment (that education is good). &quot;People will buy less of our products if our price goes up&quot; is not a value judgment because it is based on the fact that people tend to buy less of a more expensive product. It can be used either in a positive sense, signifying that a judgment must be made taking a value system into account, or in a disparaging sense, signifying a judgment made by personal whim rather than objective thought or evidence.

In its positive sense, a recommendation to make a value judgment is an admonition to consider carefully, to avoid whim and impetuousness, and search for consonance with one&#x27;s deeper convictions, and to search for an objective, verifiable, public, and consensual set of evidence for the opinion.

In its disparaging sense the term &quot;value judgment&quot; implies a conclusion is insular, one-sided, and not objective — contrasting with judgments based upon deliberation, balance, and public evidence.

&quot;Value judgment&quot; also can refer to a tentative judgment based on a considered appraisal of the information at hand, taken to be incomplete and evolving—for example, a &quot;value judgment&quot; on whether to launch a military attack or as to procedure in a medical emergency. In this case, the quality of judgment suffers because the information available is incomplete as a result of exigency, rather than as a result of cultural or personal limitations.

Most commonly the term &quot;value judgment&quot; refers to an individual&#x27;s opinion. Of course, the individual&#x27;s opinion is formed to a degree by their belief system and the culture to which they belong. So a natural extension of the term &quot;value judgment&quot; is to include declarations seen one way from one value system but may be seen differently from another. Conceptually this extension of the definition is related both to the anthropological axiom &quot;cultural relativism&quot; (that is, that cultural meaning derives from a context) and to the term &quot;moral relativism&quot; (that is, that moral and ethical propositions are not universal truths, but stem from cultural context). A value judgment formed within a specific value system may be parochial and may be subject to dispute in a wider audience.

===Value-neutral===
&quot;Value-neutral&quot; is a related adjective suggesting independence from a value system. The object itself is considered value-neutral when it is neither good nor bad, neither useful nor useless, neither significant nor trite until placed in some social context. For example, the classification of an object sometimes depends upon context: Whether or not an object is a tool or a weapon, or if human remains are an artifact or an ancestor.

Max Weber put forward one of the first concepts of value-neutrality.

A famous quote from mathematician G.H. Hardy indicates how he places the &quot;value-neutral&quot; subject of mathematics into a particular social context: &quot;A science is said to be useful if its development tends to accentuate the existing inequalities of wealth, or more directly promotes the destruction of human life&quot;.

For a discussion of whether technology is value neutral, see Martin and Schinzinger, and Wallace.

An item may have value and be value-neutral &quot;regardless&quot; of social context if its utility or importance is more-or-less self-evident, for example, oxygen supports life in all societies.

==Value judgments and their context==
Some argue that true objectivity is impossible, that even the most rigorous rational analysis is founded on the set of values accepted in the course of analysis.
Consequently, all conclusions are necessarily value judgments (and therefore may be parochial). Of course, putting all conclusions in one category does nothing to distinguish between them, and is, therefore, a useless descriptor. Categorizing a conclusion as a value judgment takes substance when the context framing the judgment is specified.
As an example, scientific &quot;truths&quot; are considered objective but are held tentatively, with the understanding that more careful evidence and/or wider experience might change matters. Further, a scientific view (in the sense of a conclusion based upon a value system) is a &quot;value judgment&quot; that is socially constructed based upon rigorous evaluation and wide consensus. With this example in mind, characterizing a view as a &quot;value judgment&quot; is vague without a description of the context surrounding it.

However, as noted in the first segment of this article, in common usage the term &quot;value judgment&quot; has a much simpler meaning with context simply implied, not specified.

<text>A pack animal, also known as a sumpter animal or beast of burden, is a working animal used to transport goods or materials by carrying them, usually on its back.

Domestic animals of many species are used in this way, among them alpacas, Bactrian camels, donkeys, dromedaries, gayal, goats, horses, llamas, mules, reindeer, water buffaloes and yaks.

==Diversity==
Traditional pack animals include ungulates such as camels, the domestic yak, reindeer, goats, water buffaloes, and llama, and domesticated members of the horse family including horses, donkeys, and mules. Occasionally, dogs can be used to carry small loads.

=== Pack animals by region ===
* Arctic – reindeer and sled dogs
* Central Africa and Southern Africa – oxen, mules, donkeys
* Eurasia – donkeys, oxen, horses, mules
** Central Asia – Bactrian camels, yaks, horses, mules, donkeys
** South and Southeast Asia – water buffaloes, yaks, Asian elephants
* North America – horses, mules, donkeys, goats
* North Africa and Middle East – dromedaries, horses, donkeys, mules, oxen
* Oceania – donkeys, horses, dromedaries, mules, oxen
* South America – llamas, donkeys, mules

==Uses==


Hauling of goods in wagons with horses and oxen gradually displaced the use of packhorses, which had been important until the Middle Ages, by the sixteenth century.

Pack animals may be fitted with pack saddles and may also carry saddlebags. Alternatively, a pair of weighted materials (often placed symmetrically) are called panniers.

While traditional usage of pack animals by nomadic tribespeople is declining, a new market is growing in the tourist expeditions industry in regions such as the High Atlas mountains of Morocco, allowing visitors the comfort of backpacking with animals. The use of pack animals &quot;is considered a valid means of viewing and experiencing&quot; some National Parks in America, subject to guidelines and closed areas.

In the 21st century, special forces have received guidance on the use of horses, mules, llamas, camels, dogs, and elephants as pack animals.

=== Load carrying capacity ===
The maximum load for a camel is roughly .

Yaks are loaded differently according to region. In Sichuan, is carried for in 6 hours. In Qinghai, at altitude, packs of up to are routinely carried, while up to is carried by the heaviest steers for short periods.

Llamas can carry roughly a quarter of their body weight, so an adult male of can carry some .

Loads for equids are disputed. The US Army specifies a maximum of 20 percent of body weight for mules walking up to a day in mountains, giving a load of up to about . However an 1867 text mentioned a load of up to . In India, the prevention of cruelty rules (1965) limit mules to and ponies to .

Reindeer can carry up to for a prolonged period in mountains.

<text>Albert Guillaume (14 February 1873 – 10 August 1942) was a French painter and caricaturist.

Born in Paris, France, Albert Guillaume became a leading caricaturist during the Belle Époque. While remembered for his poster art, Guillaume also did oil paintings such as &quot;Soirée parisienne,&quot; a portrait of Parisian dinner society. He created theater posters as well as advertising posters that were greatly influenced by the work of one of the preeminent poster painters, Jules Chéret.

== Poster art ==
Guillaume thrived during the international poster mania of the Gay Nineties. During this period, a collection of notable artists helped transform the boulevards of Paris into a gallery of fine art. Toulouse-Lautrec set the stage in 1891 with his famous poster, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;. Other fine art posters followed and the streets came alive with color. Posters soon appeared from many of the era&#x27;s great masters. Artists such as Chéret, Livemont, Hermann-Paul and Mucha helped shape the Parisian landscape.

Jules Chéret is often called the &quot;father of the modern poster.&quot; From 1895 until 1900, he collaborated with the era&#x27;s great poster artists to produce a series of smaller works suitable for collectors. For six years, Chéret and his collaborators painstakingly reproduced four posters a month. The series was a smashing success. The Maîtres de l&#x27;Affiche (&quot;Masters of Posters&quot;) collection included the two works below and it was through this series that he became known to a wider audience. The collection remains popular to this day.

== Caricature ==
Guillaume is also known for satirical drawings that were published in Parisian humor magazines such as &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, &quot;Le Rire&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Assiette au Beurre&quot;, and &quot;Le Figaro illustré&quot;. These magazines appeared as Parisians started to acquire an increased appetite for arts, culture and politics. Guillaume lampooned the foibles of French society at a time when French governance was frequently characterized by corruption and mismanagement.

== Recognition ==
The winner of a bronze medal at the Universal Exhibition of 1900 in Paris, Guillaume had many of his illustrations published in albums by such firms as &quot;Ernest Maindron&quot; and &quot;Librairie illustrée, J. Tallandier&quot; including three albums of military cartoons with the preface for the 1896 edition written by Georges Courteline.

== Death ==

<text>USS &quot;Rock&quot; (SS/SSR/AGSS-274), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the rockfish, a striped bass found in the Chesapeake Bay region and elsewhere along the United States East Coast.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Rock&quot; was laid down by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 23 December 1942; launched on 20 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. B. O. Wells, and commissioned on 26 October 1943.

==Service history==
===World War II===
After a month of intensive training in Lake Michigan, &quot;Rock&quot; passed through the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (at the time known as the Chicago Drainage Canal) to Lockport, Ill. There she entered a floating drydock for her voyage down the Mississippi River. She arrived in New Orleans on 29 November 1943, and got underway 6 days later for Panama, where she received further training before sailing for Pearl Harbor on 2 January 1944. Following voyage repairs &quot;Rock&quot; departed from Pearl Harbor for her first war patrol on 8 February 1944.

====First and second war patrols, February–May 1944====

On 29 February 1944, &quot;Rock&quot; contacted a large enemy convoy en route to Truk. Detected by destroyer &quot;Asashimo&quot; while making a night surface approach on the convoy, she fired a spread of four torpedoes from her stern tubes at the closing enemy destroyer without scoring. Then illuminated by the destroyer&#x27;s searchlight, and under fire from the surface ship&#x27;s guns, she dived. For 4 hours she underwent depth charge attacks, but survived. That night she surfaced and found that her periscopes were excessively damaged and that her bridge had been riddled with shrapnel. The damage necessitated a return to Pearl Harbor for repairs. Later that night, the busy &quot;Asashimo&quot; sank .

&quot;Rock&quot; began her second war patrol on 4 April 1944, destination Honshū. However, after 34 days in the Bungo Suido and Sagami Wan area without action, she returned to Majuro where she was refitted by .

====Third war patrol, June–August 1944====

&quot;Rock&quot;, in company with and , departed Majuro on 22 June 1944, in a coordinated attack group to patrol the Luzon Strait. At dawn on 19 July &quot;Rock&quot; attacked a Japanese convoy of seven large ships and three escorts, firing 10 torpedoes, six of which exploded. But, as she immediately dove to escape a depth-charge attack, she could not observe their effect.

Two days later &quot;Rock&quot; contacted another enemy convoy consisting of six large ships and four escorts. She launched four torpedoes, two of which seemed to hit but, again &quot;Rock&quot; was forced down by depth charges and unable to assess damage to her targets. During the remainder of her time on station, &quot;Rock&quot; weathered a severe typhoon and witnessed the sinking of Japanese submarine &quot;I-29&quot; by &quot;Sawfish&quot;. On 27 July she headed toward Pearl Harbor.

====Fourth war patrol, September–November 1944====

&quot;Rock&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 9 September 1944, en route for the South China Sea for her fourth patrol. On 26 October 1944, she scored three hits on a tanker, &quot;Rock&quot;&#x27;s only sinking, &quot;Takasago Maru No. 7&quot;, accompanied by three escorts. On 27 October 1944, she fired nine torpedoes at , stranded on Bombay Shoal, to prevent her salvage by the Japanese. Three of the torpedoes were hits. This patrol ended when &quot;Rock&quot; departed the area and sailed for Fremantle, Western Australia, for refit.

====Fifth and sixth war patrols, December 1944–May 1945====

On 14 December 1944, &quot;Rock&quot; departed Fremantle on her fifth patrol. On 12 January 1945, the U.S. Navy destroyer mistook her for a Japanese sailboat while &quot;Rock&quot; was on the surface in the South China Sea off Japanese-occupied French Indochina and opened gunfire on her at a range of . &quot;Rock&quot; crash-dived to and sustained no damage. The only other event of note during the 64-day patrol was the rescue of a downed pilot from .

At the start of her sixth patrol, which lasted from 7 March to 4 May 1945, she picked up 15 merchant seamen from the , adrift in a life raft for 32 days, and landed them at Exmouth. Continuing northward the next day, &quot;Rock&quot; was bombed by an aircraft and that night she was struck by a dud torpedo. Neither attack caused any critical damage. In a night attack on 27 March, &quot;Rock&quot; fired on an enemy destroyer escort without success. On 18 April she joined in bombarding Batan Island to leave the Japanese radio station in ruins. &quot;Rock&quot; then turned toward Saipan to complete a 54-day patrol.

From the Marianas the submarine headed for the United States, arriving at Hunter&#x27;s Point, San Francisco, 14 May for overhaul. She sailed for Pearl Harbor 7 August 1945, but with the cessation of hostilities on 15 August 1945 was ordered east. She was officially credited with damaging 42,282 gross register tons of enemy shipping during her six war patrols,

===Post-World War II===
====1945–1946====
&quot;Rock&quot; participated in Navy Day celebrations at New Orleans, then proceeded to New London where she began inactivation in November 1945. She was decommissioned 1 May 1946 and was berthed as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

====Radar picket submarine (SSR-274), 1953–1959====

In early 1951 &quot;Rock&quot; was towed from New London to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, where she was converted to a radar picket submarine by bisecting her at the forward bulkhead of the control room and inserting a section between the control room and the forward battery to house the new CIC and the majority of her new electronic equipment. Reclassified SSR-274 on 18 July 1952, Rock recommissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 12 October 1953.

After a short period of training with Submarine Squadron 6 off the Virginia Capes, she proceeded to San Diego to join Submarine Squadron 5. On 23 July 1954, she departed San Diego for the western Pacific area and a six-month tour on the Taiwan Strait Patrol. She subsequently alternated deployments to the western Pacific with operations off the United States West Coast. She made six-month deployments to the western Pacific in 1956 and during the winter of 1958–1959.

====Auxiliary general submarine (AGSS-274), 1959–1969====

By 31 December 1959 there no longer existed an operational requirement for a radar picket submarine in the fleet, and on that date the Air Control Center was decommissioned and &quot;Rock&quot; was redesignated an &quot;auxiliary general submarine,&quot; AGSS-274. Following operations off the U.S. West Coast and another overhaul, &quot;Rock&quot; again deployed to the western Pacific in November 1961. She made subsequent six-month deployments to the western Pacific in 1963, 1965, 1966–1967, and 1968.

Operating in the eastern Pacific during the first half of 1969, &quot;Rock&quot; departed San Diego 11 July and conducted operations in support of fleet training in the Hawaiian operating areas until proceeding on 16 August 1959 to the U.S. West Coast.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
On 13 September 1969, &quot;Rock&quot; decommissioned at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Struck from the Navy List on the same day, she was designated for use as a target to destruction. She was sold for scrap on 17 August 1972

<doc id="1102537" wikidata="Q2426861" url="?curid=1102537" title="Club of Madrid">
<text>Club de Madrid is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit organization created to promote democracy and change in the international community. It is composed of 126 regular members from 73 countries, including 7 Nobel Peace Prize laureates and 20 first female heads of state or government. Club de Madrid is the world&#x27;s largest forum of former heads of state and government.

Among its main goals are the strengthening of democratic institutions and counseling on the resolution of political conflicts in two key areas: democratic leadership and governance, and response to crisis and post-crisis situations.

== History and actions ==
Club de Madrid was founded in October 2001 as a result of the Conference on Democratic Transition and Consolidation held in Madrid with the objective of creating a permanent forum for governments to consult, and &quot;be able to access expert&#x27;s opinions&quot;. The event was organized by the think tank FRIDE (&quot;Fundación para las Relaciones Internacionales y el Diálogo Exteriores&quot;).

The Conference was attended by 32 current and former heads of state and government, who discussed their ideas and conclusions with over 100 experts. Among the attendees were former President of the USSR Mikhaíl Gorbachov, former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, former democratic Prime Ministers of Spain Adolfo Suárez, Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, Felipe González and José María Aznar, former Prime Minister of the Central African Republic Martin Ziguele, and US President Bill Clinton.

The Club&#x27;s first Secretary General was the co-founder of FRIDE, Antonio Álvarez-Couceiro, and its first President was former President of Brasil Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who held that post until 2006. In 2004, former Canadian Prime Minister Kim Campbell became Secretary General until 2006, when the Spanish diplomat Fernando Perpiñá-Robert took the post. Former President of Chile Ricardo Lagos was elected as the organization&#x27;s President in 2006, until 2010, when he ceded the position to former Prime Minister of the Netherlands Wim Kok. Also in 2010, Carlos Westendorp, Spanish diplomat and politician, became Secretary General.

Former President of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga was elected President of the Club in 2014. In 2016, María Elena Agüero became Secretary General and, in 2019, former President of Slovenia Danilo Türk was elected President, posts they both still hold.

The Club&#x27;s first General Assembly was held in Madrid in October 2002 approved the organization&#x27;s first Annual Policy Dialogue, year-long initiatives that involve members, other organizations, and experts in working groups to formulate policy recommendations on the decided topic. The results of some Annual Policy Dialogues and other programs have been echoed and supported in national and international legislation and pacts.

The Club de Madrid pushed for a constitutional reform in Haiti and promoted the adoption of a National Pact in 2014 to reach a democratic consensus.

With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Club de Madrid called for international cooperation, solidarity, and policies such as the &quot;creation of an international fund for assistance to the Global South to deal with the consequences of COVID-19&quot; and supported &quot;the IMF’s call for coordinated fiscal stimuli to mitigate against long-lasting economic damage&quot;. The organization called on the World Bank to support the coordinated purchase of pandemic response equipment.

Club de Madrid issued a statement in support of the 2020 International Day of the World&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples, endorsing practices of restorative justice and highlighting the cosmovision of numerous indigenous peoples towards nature. Also in 2020, the organization appealed to the authorities of Belarus to &quot;stop detentions and the use of force against unarmed demonstrators&quot; after the presidential elections in the country.

Club de Madrid also condemned the 2021 coup d&#x27;état in Myanmar and called for the &quot;immediate and unconditional release of President Win Myint, State Counsellor Daw Aung Sang Suu Kyi, members of government, of the National League for Democracy (NLD) and of civil society activists who have been detained&quot;. Also in 2021, the organization and 46 of its members publicly supported the suspension of the WTO&#x27;s intellectual property rules towards COVID-19 vaccines to make vaccination more accessible.

In June 2022, the Club de Madrid called on the Tunisian President Kais Saied to release the politician Hamadi Jebali. Club de Madrid has also repeatedly called for the release of opposition leader Alexei Navalny and other political prisoners in Russia, and for the end of the Russian invasion of Ukraine through dialogue and diplomacy.

In response to the January 8th Brazilian Congress attack, Club de Madrid condemned the event.

In 2024, the Club of Madrid sent an open letter to the G20 group in which it supported Brazil&#x27;s proposal to tax the super-rich to alleviate &quot;extreme&quot; inequality and raise the money needed for investment in industry and the green transition. In the letter, they warned that taxes are the foundation of a civilized, enterprising and prosperous society. The Club of Madrid pointed out that the Super Rich have unproductively accumulated trillions of dollars that could have been productively invested in communities, education, health and infrastructure. The result is extreme inequality, which is why 19 members of Club of Madrid believe that a new international agreement on the taxation of the super-rich is necessary. The letter was signed by, among others, former President of Chile Michelle Bachelet, former Slovenian President Danilo Tuerk, former Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, former Spanish Prime Ministers Felipe Gonzalez and Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.

==Composition and structure==
As of April 2023, there are 126 full members, all of whom are previous government officials with full voting rights. The Club also has institutional members and foundations – private and public organizations that share similar democratic objectives, including FRIDE, the Gorbachev Foundation of North America (GFNA), both original sponsors of the founding conference in 2001, the Madrid City Council, the Regional Government of Madrid, and the Government of Spain. Additionally, there are six honorary members (e.g. Javier Solana, Aung San Suu Kyi) and several fellows, who are experts on democratic change.

Full members, representatives of the constituent foundations, the Secretary General of the organization, and honorary members form the General Assembly, the highest representative and governing body of Club de Madrid. The General Assembly meets at least once a year to vote on the organization&#x27;s activities and reports, the proposal of new members, and the designation of the Secretary General, Board of Directors and President, among other activities.

The Board of Directors manages the interests of the organization according to the directives of the General Assembly.

<doc id="1102538" wikidata="Q2471002" url="?curid=1102538" title="The Century Magazine">
<text>The Century Magazine was an illustrated monthly magazine first published in the United States in 1881 by The Century Company of New York City, which had been bought in that year by Roswell Smith and renamed by him after the Century Association. It was the successor of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;. It was merged into &quot;The Forum&quot; in 1930.

==History==
The initial editor was to have been Scribner&#x27;s editor and co-owner Josiah G. Holland, but he died prior to the appearance of the first issue. He was succeeded by Richard Watson Gilder, the managing editor of Scribner&#x27;s, who would go on to helm &quot;The Century&quot; for 28 years. Gilder largely continued the mixture of literature, history, current events, and high-quality illustrations that Holland had used at Scribner&#x27;s. 
The magazine was very successful during the 19th century, most notably for a series of articles about the American Civil War which ran for three years during the 1880s. It included reminiscences of 230 participants from all ranks of the service on both sides of the conflict. According to an author writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the publication of &quot;The Century&quot; &quot;made New-York, instead of London, the centre of the illustrated periodicals published in the English language…&quot; The magazine was also a notable publisher of fiction, presenting excerpts of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; in 1884 and 1885 and Henry James&#x27; &quot;The Bostonians&quot;.

Upon Gilder&#x27;s death in 1909, Robert Underwood Johnson replaced him as editor. According to Arthur John, the magazine&#x27;s &quot;later history was marked by sudden shifts in content, format, and editorial direction.&quot; Glenn Frank was editor from 1921 to 1925, a period during which &quot;The Century&quot; was known for its editorials on current events and began to cut back on illustrations, which were eliminated after Frank left the magazine. In 1929, due to competition from cheaper magazines and newspapers, &quot;The Century&quot; became a quarterly, and in 1930 it was merged with &quot;The Forum&quot;. At the time it folded, &quot;The Century&quot; had 20,000 subscribers, less than a tenth of its peak circulation of the late nineteenth century. &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;, the periodical that became &quot;The Century&quot; in 1881, should not be confused with the &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot; that began publication in 1887.

The noted critic and editor Frank Crowninshield briefly served as the magazine&#x27;s art editor.

==Philosophy and political positions==

The tone and content of &quot;The Century&quot; changed over its long history. It began as an Evangelical Christian publication, but over time began to speak to a more general educated audience as it developed into the largest periodical in the country.

===Religion===

Novelist and poet Josiah G. Holland was one of the three original founders of &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot; and wrote regular editorials for the periodical, setting the tone for the magazine&#x27;s content. As Holland was deeply religious, Scribner&#x27;s to a great extent reflected the views and concerns of the Evangelical Christian community. While hostile towards sectarianism within Protestantism, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; initially took a strong stand against both Catholicism and those who doubted the divinity of Christ. In the first issue, under the heading &quot;Papa and the Dogma&quot;, Holland claimed that it was freedom that made the Protestant nations of Europe strong while their Catholic neighbors were, as a result of their religion, in a state of decay. Less than one year later, the magazine attacked the skepticism of Henry David Thoreau. Mormon polygamy was also a frequent target. One contributor traveled to Utah to observe the Mormon settlement there and argued that the new sect would have to end its practice of plural marriage if it were to survive and American control could be exercised over the western territories.

At the same time, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;, being non-dogmatic in its Protestantism, expressed little hostility towards modern science. For example, a three-part series discussed how believing Christians should meet the intellectual challenges of religious skepticism, and in 1874 two writers engaged one another in a debate over whether Christians should attempt to prove the divinity of Christ through science.

By the end of the 1870s, however, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; had departed from its original Evangelical orientation. An April 1879 editorial declared all seekers of truth, whether believing Christians or not, to be allies, regarding this new view as simply an application of the Golden Rule. Catholics were said to have just as much to teach Protestants as Protestants had to teach Catholics. After the magazine became &quot;The Century&quot; in 1881, it continued to hold onto this secular outlook under Gilder. The break with the past was reflected in the magazine&#x27;s changing treatment of the question of evolution. In 1875, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; argued that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Darwinism was true and attributed its wide acceptance to a contemporary bias towards novel ideas, even though the author did not on principle reject the idea that proof could be forthcoming. Upon the death of Charles Darwin in 1883, however, &quot;The Century&quot; published a laudatory tribute to the scientist written by Alfred Wallace. The magazine remained secular into its later days, in 1923 criticizing the &quot;poisonous dogmatism&quot; of the thought of William Jennings Bryan and what the magazine saw as his religious fundamentalism. Over the years, &quot;The Century&quot; published works by a large number of writers who were agnostics or atheists, including famous skeptic Bertrand Russell.

===American nationalism===

From the very beginning of his tenure as editor in 1881 to his death in 1909, &quot;The Century&quot; reflected the ideals of Gilder. He sought to create and help shape a &quot;refined&quot; American high culture, often contributing his own poetry to that end 

An unsigned May 1885 editorial expressed pride over the belief of the staff that the periodical had achieved wide circulation while remaining a quality product. This reflected the view that as a general matter there was usually a tradeoff between quality and quantity. &quot;The Century&quot; was generally seen as a conservative magazine and hoped to promote reconciliation between the North and South after the trauma of the Civil War. According to J. Arthur Bond, the magazine was instrumental in creating and shaping post-war American nationalism. In the words of one contemporary, Gilder&#x27;s &quot;spirited and tireless endeavor [ ] was to give the organic life of the American people purity of character and nobility of expression.&quot; During his tenure as editor, he promoted patriotism and the glorification of American historical figures. Seeing itself as having an &quot;elevating&quot; mission, its &quot;mixture of nationalism and cultural advocacy informed even the most &#x27;ordinary&#x27; of the magazine&#x27;s articles.&quot; Often touching on many of these themes, Theodore Roosevelt wrote as a regular contributor to the magazine over three decades, a span which included one article he published while serving as president. Gilder developed relationships with several contemporary prominent figures, including a close friendship with Grover Cleveland which he wrote about upon the death of the former president. 

Concerns over national unity and the preservation of traditional American culture were reflected in the magazine&#x27;s writings on immigration. An 1884 article discussed the composition and geographical distribution of immigrant populations, and expressed optimism over the prospect of the newer Americans assimilating into the larger population. At the same time, the article warned that measures should be taken against potential threats to national unity through fractionalization. As immigration increased over the next few decades, however, &quot;The Century&quot; became more alarmed over its effects on the future of the country, citing concerns over, among other matters, crime, illiteracy, and the overpopulation of cities. In 1904, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge took to the pages of the magazine to argue for the importance of keeping out &quot;undesirable&quot; immigrants. Twenty years later, editor Glenn Frank attacked the Ku Klux Klan and other nativists, but nonetheless wrote that &quot;[t]he hour for very severe restrictions on immigration has come…&quot; The same author returned to some of the same themes when he again attacked the KKK several months later for both its religious and racial doctrines.

===Reconstruction and civil rights===

In the immediate post-Reconstruction era, contributors to &quot;The Century&quot; debated what should be done about the postwar South and the newly free slaves, generally advocating for amicable relations between the regions and national unity. In 1873 and 1874, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; ran a number of articles under the title &quot;The Great South,&quot; a series which lasted fourteen issues. Based on Edward King&#x27;s travels, the author&#x27;s accounts generally portrayed the region in a sympathetic light and the series was warmly received by Southerners.
In 1876, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; published a eulogy to Robert E. Lee, along with an editorial postscript praising the spirit of &quot;sectional friendliness&quot; of the piece.

On the question of the freedmen, a wide variety of contemporary views were represented. Writing for &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; in 1874, one author argued that blacks were unfit to be schooled with white children. On the other hand, an 1885 article by George W. Cable despaired over what he saw as the failure to protect the rights of southern blacks after the Civil War and argued that this was the result of the former confederate states evading federal law. Henry W. Grady, responding a few months later, disputed the earlier author&#x27;s characterization of the situation, claiming that while legal rights had been granted, southern whites would never accept social integration between the races. Cable&#x27;s criticisms of the ex-Confederacy also drew a rebuke by Robert Lewis Dabney.

Even when sympathetic to the cause of the newly freed slaves, writers who argued for helping them usually did so on paternalistic grounds. Bishop T. U. Dudley, for example, expressed doubt that much could be done to elevate the status of American blacks, but argued that Christian principles required helping them to the greatest extent possible.

The question of how much government policy could do to improve the circumstances of the former slaves continued to be debated over the decades. By the turn of the century, the debates were conducted in the language of science. Robert Bennett Bean, a medical doctor, published a 1906 article arguing that social policy should be based on realistic assessments of the relative mental capacities of blacks and whites. He claimed that blacks had, on average, smaller brains than Asians or Caucasians, a finding he attributed to heredity. Similarly, Charles Francis Adams Jr. spent two years in Egypt and the Sudan and referenced his experiences to argue in 1906 that the unfortunate circumstances of American blacks were mainly due to inherently low capabilities rather than history. In the same issue, however, the editors felt it necessary to mention the dissenting view of Franz Boas, who had painted a more optimistic picture of the potential of Africans in a different periodical two years earlier.

Booker T. Washington contributed four articles to the magazine in the first decade of the twentieth century, including one on &quot;Heroes in Black Skins.&quot; and another that discussed efforts of blacks to become homeowners. A 1903 editorial sang the praises of Washington, calling him the &quot;Moses of his people&quot; and contrasting him favorably with W.E.B. Du Bois.

Reflecting the magazine&#x27;s later shift leftward, Du Bois himself contributed an article to &quot;The Century&quot; in 1923. Several editorials around that time criticized the revived Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s. Frank Tannenbaum, for example, wrote that the Klan of the Reconstruction era &quot;was a reflex of the vindictiveness of Northern politicians and of the unscrupulous carpet-baggers who swooped down upon the South as a vulture upon a wounded and stricken victim.&quot; But the contemporary Klan, according to Tannenbaum, had no such justification and simply reflected fears of change and other pathologies of segments of the white population.

===Progressive causes===

The magazine championed several Progressive causes popular in its time. Among these were several civil service reforms including competitive examinations for public offices, which its writers saw as a way to promote good governance and reduce class privilege. Similarly, in 1894 Henry Cabot Lodge attacked the &quot;un-American&quot; practice of patronage. &quot;The Century&quot; also took up some of the environmental causes of its day, expressing satisfaction over the first attempts by the federal government to preserve the nation&#x27;s forests, and in its later days supported women&#x27;s suffrage. Finally, the magazine occasionally published articles in favor of eugenics. Frank, for example, while disparaging the racism of the KKK, encouraged what he called the better individuals of every race to use the tools of modern science to focus on improving the genetic quality of all populations.

===Socialism and the labor movement===

&quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; generally defended the principles of classical economics and opposed socialism. William Graham Sumner wrote an article for the magazine in this vein praising traditional capitalist virtues such as self-reliance and individualism and attributing poverty to laziness and vice. On the other hand, Holland occasionally directed his ire towards &quot;soulless&quot; corporations that he accused of exploiting workers. In the view of the magazine, both capitalists and workers had moral obligations.

In its early days, &quot;The Century&quot; tended to adopt the same views as its predecessor. It defended capitalism, but refrained from unreflectively denouncing all forms of regulation. For example, an 1886 article opposed socialism but argued that in the future there would be more need for government activism than there had been in the past. Over the next few decades, &quot;The Century&quot; published several forceful denunciations of socialist theories and practice. In the 1890s Gilder and his editors took the position that labor unions were a foreign imposition, one of the many negative consequences of a relatively open immigration policy. Similarly, socialism was said to punish success, a concept that was anathema to the philosophy of his magazine.

Despite its conservative leanings, the magazine was open to dissenting views on economic issues in a way that it was not on deeper philosophical matters. The March 1904 issue allowed workers to publish contributions making the case for labor unions as appropriate checks on big business. Two years later, an editorial praised some of the accomplishments of the labor movement, while still maintaining that it needed to be reformed.

In its later years, after the Russian Revolution had brought the issue to the attention of the public, &quot;The Century&quot; opposed the spread of Communism. Employing Nietzschean terminology, Lothrop Stoddard in 1919 called Bolshevism &quot;the heresy of the Underman,&quot; in contrast to Prussianism, the &quot;heresy of the Overman,&quot; which had been defeated in World War I. He went on to argue that the Bolshevik Revolution had only been the local manifestation of a phenomenon that would have to be defeated worldwide and that Vladimir Lenin was &quot;a modern Jenghiz Khan plotting the plunder of a world.&quot;

===Turn-of-the-20th-century decline===

While remaining extremely influential and well-regarded among the American elite, the popularity of &quot;The Century&quot; began to decline in the 1890s and never regained the prominence it had enjoyed as the leading American periodical of the late nineteenth century. By 1900, it had about 125,000 subscribers, half of the circulation it had in the 1880s. &quot;The Century&quot; suffered due to competition from other cheaper magazines, many of which Gilder and his staff considered vulgar.

Although Gilder had been a zealous reformer, as a conservative in politics and values he never embraced the Progressive movement. As its circulation declined, the magazine took a more pessimistic tone and began to write less and less about current events. An 1898 editorial criticized &quot;the profusion in the literary and pictorial &#x27;output&#x27; which has a tendency to befog the intellect and lower the standards of taste.&quot; A few months later the magazine lamented that the &quot;age of reflection&quot; had given way to the &quot;age of agitation&quot; spread by &quot;[f]ast trains and cheap print…&quot; Similarly, a 1902 editorial argued that divorce was a threat to civilization, and nothing would be more likely to cure this ill than literature &quot;celebrating the sanctive and ever-lasting virtues of self-control, forbearance, devotion, and honor.&quot; Gilder characteristically saw a connection between a decline in morals and contemporary social problems and believed, conversely, that ennobling art could be a solution.

Even in an artistic sense, &quot;The Century&quot; of the late nineteenth century was slow to adapt to the times. In 1889, after much resistance it became the last major periodical to include photographic illustrations. The editors remained attached to painted drawings, which &quot;The Century&quot; had become renowned for. In the pages of the magazine Gilder explained this preference by complaining of the trend toward the &quot;minute and literal representation of the visible world&quot; seen in photography, as opposed to painting, which preserved only that which deserved to be recorded for posterity. He went on to argue that the spread of printing and writing would have a similar vulgarizing and cheapening effect on the written word.

Thus, the magazine maintained a great deal of self-awareness about the causes of its declining influence. According to one modern author, in the first decade of the twentieth century, Gilder and the other editors &quot;continued to bear aloft the flame of the ideal&quot; in a changing era and gave &quot;no thought of cheapening the magazine to slow the steady drifting away of subscribers.&quot; After Gilder&#x27;s death in 1909, &quot;The Century&quot; survived another two decades, but never regained its position as the leading American periodical.

===Later years, 1909-1930===

Robert Underwood Johnson was editor of &quot;The Century&quot; from Gilder&#x27;s death in 1909 until his resignation in 1913. The 1910s were marked by financial difficulties and a further decline, as the magazine competed with other periodicals of both similar and lesser quality. &quot;The Century&quot; still attracted some of the best fiction authors of the day, however. H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;prophetic trilogy&quot; &quot;The World Set Free&quot; was serialized in the magazine in the first three issues of 1914.

Glenn Frank became editor of &quot;The Century&quot; in 1921, until he left this position in 1925 to become president of the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He wrote a series of editorials in which he laid out his thoughts on the future of Western civilization. The editorials used colorful language and usually stressed the idea that contemporary social problems had created a need for social engineering and government activism in both domestic and international affairs. For example, in 1923, Frank wrote that Senator Lodge and his isolationist supporters were &quot;the amoeba of politics, strange survivals from a prehistoric era of the lowest form of political intelligence.&quot; He later argued for what he called &quot;an intelligently flexible conservatism.&quot; While warning of what he referred to as the dangers of reactionaries on the right and radicals on the left, Frank was also known for expressing a great deal of optimism over the prospect of using the social sciences to improve human affairs. This kind of enthusiasm for reform through science rather than moral progress was a noticeable break from the philosophy of the magazine during the eras of Holland and Gilder.

Other writers stressed similar themes throughout the Frank era. Reflecting the magazine&#x27;s tilt to the left, a 1924 article called for &quot;industrial democracy&quot; to be adopted in American factories. Even the magazine&#x27;s opposition to socialism was tempered, with Benjamin Stolberg arguing that the Red Scare had been an overreaction and that the Bolshevik threat to the United States had failed to materialize. The leftward shift during this time was not total, however, and, despite the tone that Frank&#x27;s editorials gave to the magazine, &quot;The Century&quot; remained open to a wide variety of views. Noted conservative G.K. Chesterton, for example, contributed an essay that was highly critical of contemporary art.

Frank was succeeded in 1925 by Hewitt H. Howland, who remained as editor until the magazine merged with &quot;The Forum&quot; in 1930.

==Historical memoirs and major reporting==

===Civil War series===

In 1877, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s&quot; published a series of short accounts from those who took part in the Battle of Mobile Bay. The parent publishing house released a series of books, &quot;The Army in the Civil War,&quot; in 13 volumes penned by U.S. Army veterans who had participated in the operations that they wrote about. This series became a best-seller. &quot;The Century&quot; continued this kind of historical reporting with Alexander R. Boteler&#x27;s first-person account of John Brown&#x27;s raid on Harpers Ferry it published in 1883, followed in the same issue by a rejoinder from Frank B. Sanborn, a self-described &quot;radical abolitionist&quot; who had helped finance the mission.

Gilder, himself a Union veteran, soon began regularly running the reflections of major Civil War figures. Originally planned to run for twelve months, the series drew so much interest that it lasted for three years and eventually led to a four-volume book. Among the contributors to the series were Union generals Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George B. McClellan. As &quot;The Century&quot; tried to avoid bias and promote American unity, it also sought out and accepted accounts from those on the Confederate side, including the generals James Longstreet and P. G. T. Beauregard The contributions led readers who had served in the war to submit unsolicited recollections and previously unpublished documents to the magazine, in addition to criticisms and rebuttals of published pieces. These submissions were so numerous that in 1885 &quot;The Century&quot; began to include them in a section titled &quot;Memoranda on the Civil War.&quot; The magazine had in effect become a forum for those who had fought each other in battle two decades earlier. In the pages of &quot;The Century&quot;, they could discuss their battles and mutually celebrate the bravery and heroism of both sides.

The idea for soliciting recollections of the Civil War originally came from assistant editor Clarence Buel, who later wrote of the difficulties he had in going about convincing former military leaders to share their experiences. In fact, Grant would not agree to contribute to the series until the former general and president had run into financial difficulties. The editors became engrossed in the Civil War project, and sometimes took tours of the famous battle sites, bringing along commanders to explain their exploits and artists to draw sketches of the scenes for the magazine. &quot;The Century&quot; office became a regular meeting place for former comrades and adversaries, as reflected in a letter an excited Gilder sent to his wife exclaiming &quot;Grant one day and Beauregard the next!&quot;

Before the publication of the series, Sherman was the only major figure of the war who had written a first-person account. Afterwards, the works that Grant, Sheridan, and McClellan contributed to &quot;The Century&quot; led to books by each of those generals.

As a result of the Civil War recollections, the number of subscribers to the magazine jumped to 250,000, a then unprecedented number for a magazine of its kind. Edward Weeks wrote that even by 1950 no &quot;quality magazine&quot; had ever had as many subscribers as &quot;The Century&quot; did in the 1880s, even though by that time the reading public had tripled in size. As of 1892, it was also the most widely circulated periodical of its price in England, with 20,000 subscribers.

=== Lincoln biography ===

&quot;The Century&quot; also acquired the rights to publish excerpts from the manuscript of a biography of President Abraham Lincoln written by his former secretaries John Hay and John G. Nicolay. The result was a series titled &quot;Abraham Lincoln: A History&quot;, which ran over three years. Decades later, &quot;The Century&quot; returned to Abraham Lincoln as a symbol of the republic&#x27;s lost virtue. The February 1909 issue had a drawing of Lincoln on its cover and included twenty-two portraits of the former president within its pages along with pictures of his life mask and a cast of his hands. Gilder&#x27;s contribution to the issue, &quot;Lincoln the Leader&quot;, held the subject up as an ideal for modern statesmen to emulate.

=== Russian dissidents ===

In the late 1880s, George Kennan traveled to Russia and wrote a series of reports on the revolutionaries who had opposed Tsar Alexander II and been sent to prisons in Siberia. Seeing him as a writer sympathetic to the autocratic regime and hostile towards its opponents, the Russian government granted Kennan relative freedom to travel around the country. During his travels, however, the author changed his mind and wrote accounts that were highly critical of the regime. His reports included detailed illustrations of the suffering of those who suffered on account of their opposition to the government. In one article, Kennan told the story of how when the decision to assassinate the Tsar was made, 47 individuals volunteered to carry out the mission. Arguing that individuals fighting for civil liberties were rarely as fanatical as the Russian revolutionaries, Kennan wrote that he believed that it was the treatment of prisoners that led to such stringent opposition to the government. He noted that &quot;playing upon the deepest and most intense of human emotions as a means of extorting information from unwilling witnesses&quot; was routine in prisons holding political offenders. For example, a young woman was led to incriminate her loved ones by being told that they had already confessed. Sometimes, a revolutionary would be told that he was going to meet his mother, taken to her, and then stopped and later informed that he would only see her if he answered questions about his past activities. A twenty-two-year-old mother was falsely led to believe that if she did not cooperate with the authorities her infant could be taken from her. The author also reported that it was common practice for prisoners to be left in solitary confinement for years while government officials searched the empire for evidence with which the offenders could be charged. Kennan came to see himself as a voice for the Russian liberals and was subsequently banned from the country. His writings on Russia were eventually published in a two-volume book.
A representative of the Russian government replied to Kennan&#x27;s arguments in &quot;The Century&quot; in 1893. and the magazine subsequently published a rebuttal by the author.

Kennan&#x27;s writings on Russia and his subsequent activism were perhaps the main causes behind the rise of anti-Tsar sentiment and sympathy for the revolutionary cause among late nineteenth-century American elites. In addition to publishing magazine articles and books, the author also began to give popular lectures on the subject, including dozens of speeches in Chicago, New York City, and Boston. In order to make an impression on the crowd, Kennan would often appear in front of them in the ragged clothes and shackles of a Russian prisoner. This advocacy inspired the formation of a number of American organizations that took up the cause of the exiles, the most prominent of them being the Society of Friends of Russian Freedom.

===Other histories and recollections===

In the early 1900s, &quot;The Century&quot; continued to publish the writings of some of the most famous historians of the era along with first-person accounts of those who had worked in the highest levels of government.

Justin Harvey Smith published four articles on the American Revolution in &quot;The Century&quot; in 1902 and 1903. The next year, S. Weir Mitchell contributed a series on the life of George Washington as a young man.
In addition to Theodore Roosevelt, &quot;The Century&quot; claimed a handful of other presidents as contributors. Grover Cleveland provided an account of perhaps the tensest moment of his two presidential administrations, the 1895 Venezuela border controversy with Britain. Andrew D. White contributed a series titled &quot;Chapters from My Diplomatic Life&quot; on his experiences serving in Germany and Russia. In September 1901, Woodrow Wilson wrote &quot;Edmund Burke and the French Revolution&quot; while still a professor at Princeton. In 1907 future President William Howard Taft wrote about the Panama Canal while serving as Secretary of War.

Over the years, &quot;The Century&quot; also published first person accounts of individuals who had worked for various presidents. Col. William H. Cook, a bodyguard who served for over 50 years in the White House, shared his memories of the administrations of Andrew Johnson and Rutherford B. Hayes. Historian James Ford Rhodes also contributed an article on the Hayes Administration, which the editors called a kind of postscript to the last-published volume of his history of the United States.

==Science==

In its early years, &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot; published a regular feature titled &quot;Nature and Science.&quot; Remaining consistent with its broad mission to educate the public, &quot;The Century&quot; published articles by some of the most prominent scientists and inventors of the day. Thomas Edison contributed to a symposium on roentgen rays and also once sat for an interview with the magazine. In the June 1900 issue, Nikola Tesla contributed a long article on &quot;the problem of increasing human energy.&quot; In a piece that combined the magazine&#x27;s interests in political and scientific issues, geneticist and Marxist J.B.S. Haldane published a 1923 article on the societal implications of technological progress.

==Literature and the arts==
Gilder has been called the &quot;literary arbiter of his time.&quot; Support for artistic excellence reflected his belief in the importance of self-improvement and the celebration of high standards. The works that appeared in his time also reflected the magazine&#x27;s moralism, as they banned references to sex, vulgarity, and insults to Christianity.

&quot;The Century&quot; published the works of a number of major literary figures. In addition to the aforementioned works of Mark Twain and Henry James, pulp magazine author Ellis Parker Butler contributed 30 stories, articles and poems to the magazine between 1896 and 1913, including &quot;My Cyclone-proof House&quot;, which appeared in the November 1896 issue. This short story was Butler&#x27;s first piece published in a major magazine. His works were illustrated by such famous artists as Jay Hambidge, May Wilson Preston, Florence Scovel Shinn, Frederic Dorr Steele, and Frederic R. Gruger. &quot;The Century&quot; published a full-color portrait of Butler (with his wife Ada and daughter Elsie) in the December 1909 issue. The portrait was drawn by family friend Ernest L. Blumenschein. The magazine also published the work of Jack London and the first-person account and ink drawings from Tierra del Fuego of American painter Rockwell Kent.

Noted engraver Alexander Wilson Drake was a long-time contributor to both &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; and its earlier incarnation as &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot;. The Century Company produced a memorial edition of Alexander Wilson Drake&#x27;s fiction and art titled &quot;Three Midnight Stories&quot; in 1916. &quot;The Century&quot; also employed many notable editorial cartoonists, including Oscar Cesare.

Bohemian composer Antonín Dvořák was another noted contributor to &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, writing during his stay at the National Conservatory in New York in the 1890s. In 1894, &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; published his fine tribute to fellow composer Franz Schubert.

During the 1900s and 1910s the Anglo-Canadian poet, story writer and essayist Marjorie Pickthall was a regular contributor to &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;.
