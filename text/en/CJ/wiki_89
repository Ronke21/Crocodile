<text>Harold Garfinkel (October 29, 1917 – April 21, 2011) was an American sociologist and ethnomethodologist, who taught at the University of California, Los Angeles. Having developed and established ethnomethodology as a field of inquiry in sociology, he is probably best known for &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology&quot; (1967), a collection of articles. Selections from unpublished materials were later published in two volumes: &quot;Seeing Sociologically&quot; and &quot;Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Program&quot;. Moreover, during his time at University of Newark, which became Rutgers University, he enrolled in Theory of Accounts, a course that covered accounting and bookkeeping procedures. Where from this class &quot;even in setting up an accounting sheet, he was theorizing the various categories into which the numbers would be placed&quot; which furthered his understanding of accountability.

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Harold Garfinkel was born in Newark, New Jersey on October 29, 1917, where he grew up in a Jewish family. His father, a furniture dealer, had hoped his son would follow him into the family business, but while he did work with his father, Garfinkel enrolled at the University of Newark to study accounting. At the University of Newark, courses were mainly taught by Columbia graduate students, whose theoretical approach guided Garfinkel later on. In the summer following graduation, Garfinkel volunteered at a Quaker work camp in Cornelia, Georgia, where he worked with students from diverse backgrounds who demonstrated a wide variety of interests, influencing his decision to later take up sociology as a career. While volunteering in Georgia, Garfinkel learned about the sociology program at the University of North Carolina. This program specifically focused on public work projects like the one Garfinkel was working on.

Garfinkel completed his master&#x27;s in 1942 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill after writing his thesis on interracial homicide under the supervision of Howard W. Odum. Garfinkel wrote the short story &quot;Color Trouble&quot;, which was first published in the journal &quot;Opportunity&quot; in 1940, and discussed the victimization of segregated black women traveling on a bus in Virginia. His short story was based on the actual experience of civil rights attorney and activist Pauli Murray, and her housemate Adelene McBean, while traveling from Washington, D.C. to Murray&#x27;s childhood home in Durham, North Carolina. With the onset of World War II, he was drafted into the Army Air Corps and served as a trainer at a base in Florida. As the war effort wound down he was transferred to Gulfport, Mississippi, where he met his wife and lifelong partner, Arlene Steinback. Harold passed away from congestive heart failure on April 21, 2011, in his home in Los Angeles leaving his wife Arlene behind.

===Harvard Department of Social Relations===

After the war, Garfinkel went to study at Harvard and met Talcott Parsons at the newly formed Department of Social Relations at Harvard University. While Parsons studied and emphasized abstract categories and generalizations, Garfinkel&#x27;s work was more focused on detailed description. &quot;What set Garfinkel apart from Parsons&#x27;s other students and colleagues was his extreme commitment to &quot;empirical studies.&quot; Rather than ask, for example, what kinds of normative networks are necessary to sustain family structures, Garfinkel would more likely ask: &#x27;What normative networks &quot;are&quot; there?&#x27; or &#x27;Are there any normative networks?&#x27;&quot; While Garfinkel continued to earn his degree at Harvard, sociologist Wilbert E. Moore, invited Garfinkel to work on the Organizational Behavior Project at Princeton University. Garfinkel taught at Princeton University for two years. This brought him in contact with some of the most prominent scholars of the day in the behavioral, informational, and social sciences including: Gregory Bateson, Kenneth Burke, Paul Lazarsfeld, Frederick Mosteller, Philip Selznick, Herbert A. Simon, and John von Neumann. Garfinkel completed his dissertation, &quot;The Perception of the Other: A Study in Social Order,&quot; in 1952.

After receiving his doctorate from Harvard, Garfinkel was asked to talk at a 1954 American Sociological Association meeting and created the term &quot;ethnomethodology.&quot; In addition, he was working alongside other people to listen to tape recordings and interview jurors for the University of Chicago&#x27;s American Jury Project, which is led by Fred Strodtbeck which also furthered his research in Ethnomethodology. Ethnomethodology became his main focus of study. It is &quot;the investigation of the rational properties of indexical expressions and other practical actions as contingent ongoing accomplishments of organized artful practices of everyday life&quot; In 1954 he joined the sociology faculty at UCLA. During the period 1963–64 he served as a Research Fellow at the Center for the Scientific Study of Suicide. Garfinkel spent the &#x27;75-&#x27;76 school year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and, in 1979–1980, was a visiting fellow at Oxford University. In 1995 he was awarded the &quot;Cooley-Mead Award&quot; from the American Sociological Association for his contributions to the field. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Nottingham in 1996. He officially retired from UCLA in 1987, though continued as an emeritus professor until his death on April 21, 2011.

==Influences==
Garfinkel was very intrigued by Parsons&#x27; study of social order. Parsons sought to offer a solution to the problem of social order (i.e., How do we account for the order that we witness in society?) and, in so doing, provide a disciplinary foundation for research in sociology. Drawing on the work of earlier social theorists (Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, Weber), Parsons postulated that all social action could be understood in terms of an &quot;action frame&quot; consisting of a fixed number of elements (an agent, a goal or intended end, the circumstances within which the act occurs, and its &quot;normative orientation&quot;). Agents make choices among possible ends, alternative means to these ends, and the normative constraints that might be seen as operative. They conduct themselves, according to Parsons, in a fashion &quot;analogous to the scientist whose knowledge is the principal determinant of his action.&quot; Order, by this view, is not imposed from above, but rather arises from rational choices made by the actor. Parsons sought to develop a theoretical framework for understanding how social order is accomplished through these choices.

Ethnomethodology was not designed to supplant the kind of formal analysis recommended by Parsons. Garfinkel stipulated that the two programs are &quot;different and unavoidably related.&quot; Both seek to give accounts of social life, but ask different kinds of questions and formulate quite different sorts of claims. Sociologists operating within the formal program endeavor to produce objective (that is to say, non-indexical) claims similar in scope to those made in the natural sciences. To do so, they must employ theoretical constructs that pre-define the shape of the social world. Unlike Parsons, and other social theorists before and since, Garfinkel&#x27;s goal was not to articulate yet another explanatory system. He expressed an &quot;indifference&quot; to all forms of sociological theorizing. Instead of viewing social practice through a theoretical lens, Garfinkel sought to explore the social world directly and describe its autochthonous workings in elaborate detail. Durkheim famously stated, &quot;[t]he objective reality of social facts is sociology&#x27;s fundamental principle.&quot; Garfinkel substituted &#x27;phenomenon&#x27; for &#x27;principle&#x27;, signaling a different approach to sociological inquiry. The task of sociology, as he envisions it, is to conduct investigations into just how Durkheim&#x27;s social facts are brought into being. The result is an &quot;alternate, asymmetric and incommensurable&quot; program of sociological inquiry.

Alfred Schütz, a European scholar and acquaintance of Garfinkel introduced the young sociologist to newly emerging ideas in social theory, psychology and phenomenology. Schütz, like Parsons, was concerned with establishing a sound foundation for research in the social sciences. He took issue, however, with the Parsonsian assumption that actors in society always behave rationally. Schütz made a distinction between reasoning in the &#x27;natural attitude&#x27; and scientific reasoning. The reasoning of scientists builds upon everyday commonsense, but, in addition, employs a &quot;postulate of rationality.&quot; Scientific reasoning imposes special requirements on their claims and conclusions (e.g., application of rules of formal logic, standards of conceptual clarity, compatibility with established scientific &#x27;facts&#x27;). This has two important implications for research in the social sciences. First, it is inappropriate for sociologists to use scientific reasoning as a lens for viewing human action in daily life, as Parsons had proposed, since they are distinct kinds of rationality. On the other hand, the traditionally assumed discontinuity between the claims of science and commonsense understandings is dissolved since scientific observations employ both forms of rationality. This raises a flag for researchers in the social sciences, since these disciplines are fundamentally engaged in the study of the shared understandings that underlie the day-to-day functioning of society. How can we make detached, objective claims about everyday reasoning, if our conceptual apparatus is hopelessly contaminated with commonsense categories and rationalities?

===The Roots of Ethnomethodology===
Garfinkel&#x27;s concept of ethnomethodology started with his attempt at analyzing a jury discussion after a Chicago case in 1945. Garfinkel was attempting to understand the way jurors knew how to act as jurors. After attempting to understand the jurors&#x27; actions, Garfinkel created the term &quot;ethnomethodology&quot; as a way to describe how people use different methods in order to understand the society they live in. Garfinkel noticed through his study of ethnomethodology that the methods people use to understand the society they live in are very much fixed in people&#x27;s natural attitudes.
His main idea was that when thinking through a sociological lens, sociologists would be only thinking about outside sources (social facts) to explain a situation when trying to explain what is happening within it. Garfinkel uses this point to emphasize how different ethnomethodology is from sociology and Durkheim&#x27;s thinking. In sociology, it is more common to use outside sources such as institutions to describe a situation, rather than the individual.

=== Rationality ===
Accepting Schütz&#x27;s critique of the Parsonian program, Garfinkel sought to find another way of addressing the Problem of Social Order. Social order arises in the very ways that participants conduct themselves together. The sense of a situation arises from their interactions. Garfinkel writes, &quot;any social setting [can] be viewed as self-organizing with respect to the intelligible character of its own appearances as either representations of or as evidences-of-a-social-order.&quot; The orderliness of social life, therefore, is produced through the moment-to-moment work of society&#x27;s members and ethnomethodology&#x27;s task is to explicate just how this work is done. He wrote, &quot;Members to an organized arrangement are continually engaged in having to decide, recognize, persuade, or make evident the rational, i.e., the coherent, or consistent, or chosen, or planful, or effective, or methodical, or knowledgeable character of [their activities]&quot;. On first inspection, this might not seem very different from Parsons&#x27; proposal; however their views on rationality are not compatible. For Garfinkel, society&#x27;s character is not dictated by an imposed standard of rationality, either scientific or otherwise.

To Garfinkel, rationality is itself produced as a local accomplishment in, and as, the very ways that society&#x27;s members craft their moment-to-moment interaction. He writes:

In his chapter, &quot;The Rational Properties of Scientific and Common Sense Activities&quot; in his book, &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology, 1967,&quot; Garfinkel discusses how there are various meanings of the term &quot;rationality&quot; in relation to the way people behave. Garfinkel mentions Schütz&#x27;s paper on the issues of rationality and his various meanings of the term. Garfinkel discusses each of these &quot;rationalities&quot; and the &quot;behaviors&quot; that result, which are:

# Categorizing and Comparing: &quot;Sometimes rationality refers to the fact that he searches the two situations with regard to their comparability, and sometimes to his concern for making matters comparable&quot;
# Tolerable error: &quot;It is possible for a person to &#x27;require&#x27; varying degrees of &#x27;goodness of fit&#x27; between an observation and theory in terms of which he names, measures, describes, or otherwise intends the sense of his observation as a datum&quot;
# Search for &quot;means&quot;: &quot;Rationality is sometimes used to mean that a person reviews rules of procedure which in the past yielded the practical effects now desired&quot;
# Analysis of alternatives and consequences: &quot;Frequently the term rationality is used to call attention to the fact that a person in assessing a situation anticipates the alterations which his actions will produce&quot;
# Strategy: &quot;Prior to the actual occasion of choice a person may assign to a set of alternative courses of action the conditions under which any one of them is to be followed&quot;
# Concern for timing: &quot;the concern for timing involves the extent to which he takes a position with regard to the possible ways in which events can temporally occur&quot;
# Predictability: &quot;He may seek preliminary information about it in order to establish some empirical constants or he may attempt to make the situation predictable by examining the logical properties of the constructs he uses in &#x27;defining&#x27; it ...&quot;
# Rules of procedure: &quot;Sometimes rationality refers to rules of procedure and inference in terms of which a person decides the correctness of his judgments, inferences, perceptions, and characterizations&quot;
# Choice: &quot;Sometimes the fact that a person is aware of the actual possibility of exercising a choice and sometimes the fact that he chooses are popular meanings of rationality&quot;
# Grounds of choice: &quot;The grounds upon which a person exercises a choice among alternatives as well as the grounds he uses to legitimize a choice are frequently pointed out as rational features of an action&quot;
# Compatibility of ends-means relationships with principles of formal logic: &quot;A person may treat a contemplated course of action as an arrangement of steps in the solution of a problem&quot;
# Semantic clarity and distinctness: &quot;Reference is often made to a person&#x27;s attempt to treat the semantic clarity of a construction as a variable with a maximum value which must be approximated as a required step in solving the problem of constructing a credible definition of a situation&quot;
# Clarity and distinctness &quot;for its own sake&quot;: &quot;Schütz points out that a concern for clarity and distinctness may be a concern for distinctness that is adequate for the person&#x27;s purposes.&quot;
# Compatibility of the definition of a situation with scientific knowledge: &quot;A person can allow what he treats as &#x27;matters of fact&#x27; to be criticized in terms of their compatibility with the body of scientific findings&quot;

Garfinkel notes that often, rationality refers to &quot;the person&#x27;s feelings that accompany his conduct, e.g. &quot;affective neutrality,&quot; &quot;unemotional,&quot; &quot;detached,&quot; &quot;disinterested,&quot; and &quot;impersonal.&quot; For the theoretical tasks of this paper, however, the fact that a person may attend his environment with such feelings is uninteresting. It is of interest, however, that a person uses his feelings about his environment to recommend the sensible character of the thing he is talking about or the warrant of a finding.&quot;

=== Reflexivity ===
Reflexivity means that members shape action or want relation to context while the context itself is constantly being redefined through action. Garfinkel regarded indexical expressions as key phenomena. Words like &quot;here&quot;, &quot;now&quot;, and &quot;me&quot; shift their meaning depending on when and where they are used. Philosophers and linguists refer to such terms as indexicals because they point into (index) the situational context in which they are produced. One of Garfinkel&#x27;s contributions was to note that such expressions go beyond &quot;here&quot;, &quot;now,&quot; etc. and encompass any and all utterances that members of society produce. As Garfinkel specified, &quot;The demonstrably rational properties of indexical expressions and indexical actions [are] an ongoing achievement of the organized activities of everyday life&quot;. The pervasiveness of indexical expressions and their member-ordered properties means that all forms of action provide for their own understandability through the methods by which they are produced. That is, action has the property of reflexivity whereby such action is made meaningful in the light of the very situation within which it is produced.

The contextual setting, however, should not be seen as a passive backdrop for the action. The initial insight into the importance of reflexivity occurred during the study of juror&#x27;s deliberations, wherein what jurors had decided was used by them to reflexively organize the plausibility of what they were deciding. Other investigations revealed that parties did not always know what they meant by their own formulations; rather, verbal formulations of the local order of an event were used to collect the very meanings that gave them their coherent sense. Garfinkel declared that the issue of how practical actions are tied to their context lies at the heart of ethnomethodological inquiry. Using professional coffee tasting as an illustration here, taste descriptors do not merely describe but also direct the tasting of a cup of coffee; hence, a descriptor is not merely the causal result of what is tasted, as in:

Nor is it an imperialism of a methodology:

Rather, the description and what it describes are mutually determinative:

The descriptors operate reflexively by finding in the coffee what they mean, and each is used to make the other more explicit. Much the same may be said about rules-in-games or the use of accounts in ordinary action. This reflexivity of accounts is ubiquitous, and its sense has nearly nothing to do with how the term &quot;reflexivity&quot; is used in analytic philosophy, in &quot;reflexive ethnographies&quot; that endeavor to expose the influence of the researcher in organizing the ethnography, or the way many social scientists use &quot;reflexivity&quot; as a synonym for &quot;self-reflection.&quot; For ethnomethodology reflexivity is an actual, unavoidable feature of everyone&#x27;s daily life.

=== Service Lines ===
Garfinkel has frequently illustrated ethnomethodological analysis by means of the illustration of service lines. Everyone knows what it is like to stand in a line. Queues are a part of our everyday social life; they are something within which we all participate as we carry out our everyday affairs. We recognize when someone is waiting in a line and, when we are &quot;doing&quot; being a member of a line, we have ways of showing it. In other words, lines may seem impromptu and routine, but they exhibit an internal, member-produced embodied structure. A line is &quot;witnessably a produced social object;&quot; it is, in Durkheimian terms, a &quot;social fact.&quot; Participants&#x27; actions as &quot;seeably&quot; what they are (such as occupying a position in a queue) depend upon practices that the participant engages in relation to others&#x27; practices in the proximate vicinity. To recognize someone as in a line, or to be seen as &quot;in line&quot; ourselves requires attention to bodily movement and bodily placement in relation to others and to the physical environment that those movements also constitute. This is another sense that we consider the action to be indexical—it is made meaningful in the ways in which it is tied to the situation and the practices of members who produce it. The ethnomethodologist&#x27;s task becomes one of analyzing how members&#x27; ongoing conduct is a constituent aspect of this or that course of action. Such analysis can be applied to any sort of social matter (e.g., being female, following instructions, performing a proof, participating in a conversation). These topics are representative of the kinds of inquiry that ethnomethodology was intended to undertake. In particular, Garfinkel conducted a famous case study on Agnes, a transgender woman in 1967. &quot;Garfinkel view[ed] sexuality as a practical and ongoing accomplishment of members through their practical activities&quot; and focused on how &quot;Agnes &#x27;passed&#x27; as a normal female despite the continuous risk that she would be revealed as a transsexual.&quot;

=== Breaching experiments ===
According to George Ritzer, a sociologist, breaching experiments are experiments where &quot;social reality is violated in order to shed light on the methods by which people construct social reality.&quot; In Garfinkel&#x27;s work, he encouraged his students to attempt breaching experiments in order to provide examples of basic ethnomethodology. According to Garfinkel, these experiments are important because they help us understand &quot;&#x27;the socially standardized and standardizing, &quot;seen but unnoticed,&quot; expected, background features of everyday scenes.&#x27;&quot; He highlights many of these experiments in his books.

The following is an example of one of Garfinkel&#x27;s breaching experiments from his book, &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology&quot;.

Today, some textbooks in sociology often suggest that breaching experiments are the research method that ethnomethodologists use to explore the social organization of action. However, for Garfinkel breaching experiments mostly are a teaching tool that he describes as &quot;tutorial exercises in Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Program.

==Influence on later research==

A substantial corpus of empirical work has developed exploring the issues raised by Garfinkel&#x27;s writings.

Directly inspired by Garfinkel, Harvey Sacks undertook to investigate the sequential organization of conversational interaction. This program, pioneered with colleagues Gail Jefferson and Emanuel Schegloff, has produced a large and flourishing research literature. A second, smaller literature has grown out of another of Sacks&#x27; interests having to do with social categorization practices.

Sociologist Emanuel A. Schegloff used the concept of ethnomethodology to study telephone conversations and how they influence social interaction. Gail Jefferson used ethnomethodology to study laughter and how people know when it is appropriate to laugh in conversation. John Heritage and David Greatbach studied rhetoric of political speeches and their relation to the amount of applause the speaker receives, whereas Steven Clayman studied how booing in an audience is generated. Philip Manning and George Ray studied shyness in an ethnomethodological way. Ethnomethodologists such as Graham Button, R. J. Anderson, John Hughes, Wes Sharrock, Angela Garcia, Jack Whalen, and D. H. Zimmerman all study ethnomethodology within institutions.

Early on, Garfinkel issued a call for ethnomethodologically informed investigations into the nature of work. This led to a wide variety of studies focusing on different occupations and professions, including laboratory science, law, police work, medicine, jazz improvisation, education, mathematics, philosophy, and others.

Garfinkel&#x27;s program strongly resonates in a wide range of disciplines, including sociology, linguistics, gender studies, organization studies and management as well as in the technical sciences. In the technical sciences, ethnomethodology&#x27;s influence can probably be ascribed to Lucy Suchman&#x27;s analysis of learning to use a copy machine. It came to serve as an important critique of theories of planning in Artificial Intelligence.

==Selected publications==
The bulk of Garfinkel&#x27;s original writings came in the form of scholarly articles and technical reports, most of which were subsequently republished as book chapters. To appreciate the sequential development of Garfinkel&#x27;s thought, however, it is important to understand when these pieces were actually written. Although published in 2006, &quot;Seeing Sociologically&quot; was actually written as an annotated version of a draft dissertation proposal two years after arriving at Harvard. &quot;Toward a Sociological Theory of Information&quot; was also written while Garfinkel was a student and was based on a 1952 report prepared in conjunction with the Organizational Behavior Project at Princeton. Some of Garfinkel&#x27;s early papers on ethnomethodology were republished as &quot;Studies in Ethnomethodology&quot;. This publication is well known by many sociologists. Garfinkel subsequently published an edited anthology showcasing selected examples of ethnomethodologically informed work. Later still, a mix of previously published papers and some new writing was released as &quot;Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Program: Working Out Durkheim&#x27;s Aphorism&quot;. This latter collection, in conjunction with the &quot;Studies,&quot; represent the definitive exposition of the ethnomethodological approach. Garfinkel had planned to publish a companion piece to &quot;Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Program&quot;, which was tentatively entitled, &quot;Workplace and Documentary Diversity of Ethnomethodological Studies of Work and Sciences by Ethnomethodology&#x27;s Authors: What did we do? What did we learn?&quot;. This project was never completed, but some preliminary notes were published in &quot;Human Studies.&quot;

<text>Lawrence Robert &quot;Pun&quot; Plamondon (April 27, 1945 – March 6, 2023) was an American activist, known for being a 1960s left-wing activist who helped found the White Panther Party. He was the first hippie to be listed on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list due to his alleged participation in a bombing, though charges were ultimately dropped due to high-level governmental agency misconduct rejecting warrantless interception of phone calls based on a claim of &quot;national security&quot; an issue finally decided on appeal by the Supreme Court of the United States.

== Biography ==
Plamondon was born at Traverse City State Hospital in Traverse City, Michigan, on April 27, 1945. His birth father was half-Odawa and his birth mother was part-Ojibwe, which he was unaware of early in life. A local couple adopted him and gave him his name, Lawrence Robert Plamondon. Plamondon had a troubled childhood and left home as a teenager.

At the age of 21, Plamondon was in Detroit, Michigan, in 1967, when the protests against the Vietnam War and a riot occurred. Making sandals during the day and smoking marijuana in the evening, he was soon meeting with John Sinclair.

In 1968, Plamondon and a few friends moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where they established a commune at 1510 Hill Street. With John Sinclair, they founded the White Panther Party, which supported the goals of the Black Panther Party. He was indicted for bombing a CIA office in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on September 29, 1968. Changing his appearance, he went underground and fled to San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Germany, Italy, and finally to Algeria. In May 1970, he was listed on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. After a few months he covertly returned to the United States. In July 1970, Plamondon was discovered and arrested after being stopped for littering. He was the 307th fugitive to be placed on the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted fugitives list and spent nearly three months on the list before being captured.

While waiting trial and after being convicted, he spent 32 months in federal prison. During the trial, the government admitted to wiretapping without a warrant. The case went to the United States Supreme Court and was decided in &quot;United States v. U.S. District Court&quot;, also now famously known as the &quot;Keith Case&quot;, which held that not even the invocation of &quot;national security&quot; by the president of the United States could insulate illegal activity from Constitutional rights to privacy (). The charges were dismissed.

He was indicted and convicted of an alleged terrorist bombing of a covert CIA office. That matter involved substantial litigation – his case against the government for illegal domestic surveillance was successfully pleaded to the US Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. U.S. District Court&quot; (1972). It took the form of a Writ of Mandamus, which was won at the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and an appeal on certiorari to the Supreme Court. The wiretap evidence was suppressed, and the criminal case dropped. 

Later, Plamondon found work as a roadie, driving equipment trucks for rock bands including Kiss and Foreigner.

Plamondon lived in Barry County, Michigan, with his wife Patricia Lynn. He was a self-employed carpenter. He told American Indian stories to young children at schools, libraries, museums, and summer camps. His home was a gathering place for American Indian celebrations.

==Death and memorial==
Plamondon died on March 6, 2023, in Barry County at the age of 77. In 2023, John Sinclair did a eulogy at the tribute for Plamondon, with whom he helped found the White Panthers party. Sinclair said, “He was a brilliant character,” but Sinclair went on at such length about his own contribution so much so that he was interrupted and reminded that &#x27;this is about Pun.&#x27;&lt; On June 12, 2023, the &quot;Ann Arbor Observer&quot; noted:
&quot;June 16, 2023: Mike Smith &amp; the Cadillac Cowboys.&lt;br&gt;
Veteran local country band, led by singer-guitarist Smith, whose repertoire includes classic country, western swing, and boogie-woogie. This show is dedicated to the memory of the late Pun Plamondon, and during the break speakers reminisce about the life and accomplishments this 60s activist, cofounder of the Ann Arbor-based White Panther Party.&quot;

<doc id="1112207" wikidata="Q612017" url="?curid=1112207" title="FK Chmel Blšany">
<text>FK Chmel Blšany was a Czech football club based in the village of Blšany. The club played in the Czech First League between 1998 and 2006 and was the first professional club of goalkeeper Petr Čech. The club disbanded in 2016 after resigning from the 2016-17 regional championship (5th tier of the Czech Republic football league system).

The club was established as Sokol Blšany in 1946. The club played at the Městský Stadion with capacity of 2,300 seats. That meant that even with every citizen of Blšany village in the stand, there would be still about 1,500 free seats.

==History==
FK Chmel Blšany was founded in 1946 as Sokol Blšany. Only amateur football was played in Blšany for a long time. In 1988, the team managed to reach the division and three years later the third Czechoslovakian league. In 1993, FK Chmel Blšany (or Chmelaři as called by their fans) reached the second league and in 1998 the first. In the 1998–99 season, FK Blšany astonished the Czech Republic and achieved 6th place. In 2005–06, the team ended up last and were relegated to the second league. In 2006–07, their first season back in the 2. Liga, they finished eighth but were relegated to the third-tier ČFL due to not receiving a license from the league due to financial reasons. They finished last in the ČFL with just four wins in the 2007–08 season and were subsequently relegated for the third time in as many seasons. It did not get better in 2008–09 when, upon finishing 14th of 16 teams in Divize B of the Czech Fourth Division, they were relegated for the fourth time in a row, partially due to a three-point deduction due to financial concerns. In 2009–10 they finished third in the fifth-tier Ústí Region championship and avoided relegation for the first time since the 2004–05 season. At the end of the 2010–11 season, Blšany gained promotion back to the Czech Fourth Division.

Notable past players include Petr Čech (1999–2001), Jan Šimák (1996–2000), Jan Velkoborský (1999–2003), Jiří Němec (2002–2003), Daniel Kolář (2005), Patrik Gedeon (1995–2001 &amp; 2007) and Štěpán Vachoušek (2001).

<doc id="1112210" wikidata="Q2795638" url="?curid=1112210" title="Chicago VI">
<text>Chicago VI is the fifth studio album by American rock band Chicago and was released on June 25, 1973, by Columbia Records. It was the band&#x27;s second in a string of five consecutive albums to make it to No. 1 in the US, was certified gold less than a month after its release, and has been certified two-times platinum since. It is the first album to feature percussionist Laudir de Oliveira, who would become a full-fledged member of the band for &quot;Chicago VIII&quot;. VI is the first studio album (the other being 1975&#x27;s compilation &quot;Chicago IX&quot;) to feature the original band members on the cover before the death of leader and co-founder Terry Kath.

==Background==
After having recorded all of Chicago&#x27;s first five albums in New York City (except for parts of the second album recorded at CBS in Los Angeles), producer James William Guercio had his own Caribou Studios built in Nederland, Colorado during 1972. It was finished in time for the band to record their sixth album the following February, and would remain their recording base for the next four years.

Robert Lamm authored half of the album&#x27;s tracks, including his response to some of Chicago&#x27;s negative reviewers in &quot;Critics&#x27; Choice&quot;. James Pankow wrote the album&#x27;s two hits, &quot;Just You &#x27;n&#x27; Me&quot;, which peaked at No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Stronger Every Day&quot;, which peaked at No. 10. The latter was co-composed with Peter Cetera, who also wrote &quot;In Terms of Two&quot;, and sang lead vocal on all three songs.

Released in June 1973, &quot;Chicago VI&quot; was another commercial success, spending five non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart in the US, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) less than a month after its release. It was certified two-times platinum in 1986, the first year the RIAA awarded platinum certification to albums released before 1976. The album did not chart in the UK, although the band&#x27;s first three studio albums had charted in the top ten there.

The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. The original US CD release (Columbia CK #32400) was mastered for CD by Joe Gastwirt. &quot;Chicago VI&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records in 2002, with two bonus tracks: a Terry Kath demo called &quot;Beyond All Our Sorrows&quot;, and a recording of Al Green&#x27;s &quot;Tired of Being Alone&quot;, taken from the 1973 TV special &quot;Chicago in the Rockies&quot;. In 2013, the audiophile reissue company Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab remastered &quot;Chicago VI&quot; and released it on Hybrid SACD, which can be played on both CD players and SACD players.

<doc id="1112217" wikidata="Q7623621" url="?curid=1112217" title="Strict scrutiny">
<text>In U.S. constitutional law, when a law infringes upon a fundamental constitutional right, the court may apply the strict scrutiny standard. Strict scrutiny holds the challenged law as presumptively invalid unless the government can demonstrate that the law or regulation is necessary to achieve a &quot;compelling state interest&quot;. The government must also demonstrate that the law is &quot;narrowly tailored&quot; to achieve that compelling purpose, and that it uses the &quot;least restrictive means&quot; to achieve that purpose. Failure to meet this standard will result in striking the law as unconstitutional.

In the United States, the standard is the highest and most stringent standard of judicial review and is part of the levels of judicial scrutiny that US courts use to determine whether a constitutional right or principle should give way to the government&#x27;s interest against observance of the principle. The lesser standards are rational basis review and exacting or intermediate scrutiny. These standards are applied to statutes and government action at all levels of government within the United States.

The notion of &quot;levels of judicial scrutiny&quot;, including strict scrutiny, was introduced in Footnote 4 of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot; (1938), one of a series of decisions testing the constitutionality of New Deal legislation. One of the most notable cases in which the Supreme Court applied the strict scrutiny standard and found the government&#x27;s actions constitutional was &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944), in which the Court upheld the forced relocation of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II. Another example is the D.C. Circuit Court&#x27;s 2007 ruling in &quot;Abigail Alliance v. von Eschenbach&quot; that compelling government interest was demonstrated in the restriction of unapproved prescription drugs.

The burden of proof falls on the state in cases that require strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny, but not the rational basis.

== Applicability ==
U.S. courts apply the strict scrutiny standard in two contexts:

* when a fundamental constitutional right is infringed, particularly those found in the Bill of Rights and those the court has deemed a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause or &quot;liberty clause&quot; of the 14th Amendment, or
* when a government action applies to a &quot;suspect classification&quot;, such as race or national origin.

To satisfy the strict scrutiny standard, the law or policy must:

* be justified by a compelling governmental interest. While the Courts have never brightly defined how to determine if an interest is compelling, the concept generally refers to something necessary or crucial, as opposed to something merely preferred. Examples include national security, preserving the lives of a large number of individuals, and not violating explicit constitutional protections.
* be narrowly tailored to achieve that goal or interest. If the government action encompasses too much (overbroad) or fails to address essential aspects of the compelling interest, then the rule is not considered narrowly tailored.
* be the least restrictive means for achieving that interest: there must not be a less restrictive way to effectively achieve the compelling government interest. The test will be met even if there is another method that is equally the least restrictive. Some legal scholars consider this &quot;least restrictive means&quot; requirement part of being narrowly tailored, but the Court generally evaluates it separately.

Legal scholars, including judges and professors, often say that strict scrutiny is &quot;strict in theory, fatal in fact&quot; since popular perception is that most laws subjected to the standard are struck down. However, an empirical study of strict scrutiny decisions in the federal courts found that laws survive strict scrutiny more than 30% of the time. In one area of law, religious liberty, laws that burden religious liberty survived strict scrutiny review in nearly 60% of cases. However, a discrepancy was found in the type of religious liberty claim, with most claims for exemption from law failing and no allegedly discriminatory laws surviving. See also the cases cited below, however; several appear to permit the exemption from laws based upon religious liberty.

Harvard law professor Richard Fallon Jr. has written that rather than being neatly applied, under strict scrutiny, &quot;interpretation is more varied than is often recognized&quot;, a view that has been acknowledged by U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Clarence Thomas (e.g. in his dissent (part III) in &quot;Hellerstedt&quot;).

The compelling state interest test is distinguishable from the rational basis test, which involves claims that do not involve a suspect class or fundamental right, but still arise under the Equal Protection Clause or Due Process Clause.

Presumption of constitutionality doesn&#x27;t apply under &quot;strict scrutiny&quot;; the burden to prove the constitutionality of a law shifts to the government lawyers.

==Suspect classification==

The Supreme Court has established standards for determining whether a statute or policy must satisfy strict scrutiny. One ruling suggested that the affected class of people must have experienced a history of discrimination, must be definable as a group based on &quot;obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics&quot;, or be a minority or &quot;politically powerless&quot;.

The Court has consistently found that classifications based on race, national origin, and alienage require strict scrutiny review. The Supreme Court held that all race-based classifications must be subjected to strict scrutiny in &quot;Adarand Constructors v. Peña,&quot; 515 U.S. 200 (1995), overruling &quot;Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC&quot; (89-453), 497 U.S. 547 (1990), which had briefly allowed the use of intermediate scrutiny to analyze the Equal Protection implications of race-based classifications in the narrow category of affirmative-action programs established by the federal government in the broadcasting field.

==&quot;De jure&quot; versus &quot;de facto&quot; discrimination==
As applied in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, which upheld the race-based exclusion order and internment during World War II of Japanese Americans who had resided on the West Coast of the United States, strict scrutiny was limited to instances of &quot;de jure&quot; discrimination, where a racial classification is written into the language of a statute.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.&quot; provided further definition to the concept of intent and clarified three particular areas in which intent of a particular administrative or legislative decision becomes apparent, the presence of any of which demands the harsher equal protection test. The Court must use strict scrutiny if one of these tests, among others, is met:
# the impact is so &quot;stark and dramatic&quot; as to be unexplainable on non-racial grounds, as in &quot;Yick Wo v. Hopkins&quot; (1886);
# the historical background of the decision suggests intent;
# the legislative and administrative records leading up to the decision show intent.

=== Notable cases ===

<text>This is a list of Russian towns and cities that were renamed.

== Background ==
Historical reasons behind geographical renaming were
*a particularly large number of cities and towns were renamed in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917
*more renamings happened during the whole history of the Soviet Union for political reasons
*in 1945, German cities around Königsberg were made part of the Kaliningrad Oblast exclave, see list of cities and towns in East Prussia
*soon after the reconquest of Southern Sakhalin in 1945, Japanese placenames were replaced with Russian ones.
*Circa 1972-73, many Chinese or Chinese-sounding place names in the Russian Far East were replaced with Russian-sounding ones.
*in 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, renamings (often for restoration of original names) happened, although infrequently.

<text>Steven M. Gibson (born March 26, 1955) is an American software engineer, security researcher, and IT security proponent. In the early 1980s, he worked on light pen technology for use with Apple and Atari systems, and in 1985, founded Gibson Research Corporation, best known for its SpinRite software. He is also known for his work on the Security Now podcast.

Gibson&#x27;s engineering approach to understanding areas of interest inform his clear and direct delivery on the Security Now! podcast and have shaped his software development methodology which ensures both efficiency and functionality from design to implementation. His software packages being orders of magnitude smaller than some counterparts whilst being more functionally capable. 

==Early life==
Gibson started working on computers as a teenager, and got his first computing job with Stanford University&#x27;s artificial intelligence lab when he was 15 years old. He then studied electrical engineering and computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.

==Career==
Gibson was hired as a programmer for California Pacific Computer Company in 1980, where he worked on copy protection for the company&#x27;s products. He then founded Gibson Laboratories in Laguna Hills, California, in 1981, which developed a light pen for the Apple II, Atari, and other platforms before going out of business in 1983.

In 1985, Gibson founded Gibson Research Corporation (GRC), a computer software development firm, and from 1986 to 1993, he wrote the &quot;Tech Talk&quot; column for &quot;InfoWorld&quot; magazine.

In 1999, Gibson created one of the first adware removal programs, which he called OptOut. In 2001, he predicted that Microsoft&#x27;s implementation of the SOCK_RAW protocol in the initial release of Windows XP would lead to widespread chaos by making it easier for Windows XP users to create denial of service (DoS) attacks. That year, his company&#x27;s website was brought down by DoS attacks which continued for two weeks. Gibson blogged about the attacks and his (ultimately successful) efforts to track down the hacker. Three years after the Windows XP release, Microsoft limited raw socket support in Service Pack 2.

In 2005, he launched a weekly podcast called &quot;Security Now&quot; with Leo Laporte on TWiT.tv, with its archives hosted on GRC&#x27;s website. In November 2024, the podcast hit 1,000 episodes, more than Gibson ever had intended.

In 2006, Gibson raised the possibility that the Windows Metafile vulnerability bug was actually a backdoor intentionally engineered into the system. A response by Microsoft, and by Mark Russinovich on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Technet&quot; blog, stated that the bug appeared to be coding error and that Gibson&#x27;s reasoning was based upon Microsoft&#x27;s abort procedure documentation being misleading.

In 2013, he proposed SQRL as a way to simplify the process of authentication without the risk of revelation of information about the transaction to a third party.

===GRC products===
GRC has created a number of utilities, most of which are freeware.

* DNS Benchmark, freeware that lets users test the performance of the domain name servers used by their internet service providers.
* Securable, freeware to test whether a pre-Windows 7 computer is 64-bit compatible. It also tells the user whether Data Execution Prevention is enabled.
* ShieldsUP, a free browser-based firewall testing service; one of the oldest available
* SpinRite, a hard disk scanning and data recovery utility first released in 1988. the current version was 6.0, which was first released in 2004. SpinRite is a commercial product, costing . Gibson&#x27;s work on SpinRite has led to him being considered an expert on hard drive failure.
* Spoofarino, freeware released in 2006 and promised since the controversy over the launch of Windows XP in 2001, it enables users to test whether their internet service providers allow them to send forged or &quot;spoofed&quot; packets of data to Gibson&#x27;s web site.
* Never10, standalone freeware program that toggles registry values in Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, which either disables or enables Microsoft&#x27;s Get Windows 10 app and automatic OS upgrade. As of version 1.3, it also triggers the removal of any previously downloaded Windows 10 upgrade files as part of the disable function. 
* InControl, stops automatic upgrading of Windows 10 and 11.
* InSpectre, a utility that examines a computer&#x27;s vulnerability to the Meltdown and Spectre attacks.
* InitDisk, a tool that was developed for GRC&#x27;s SpinRite (6.1), is a safe USB drive formatter that allows the user to reformat any USB device and make it bootable.
* ReadSpeed, an accurate benchmark for PC mass storage. The tool measures stability and repeatability to a precision of more than 4 significant digits.
* ValiDrive, a tool that validates whether or not USB flash drives or other Removable media are actually capable of storing the amount of data that they claim to. 
* Ultra-High Entropy PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) which are critical to any and all computerized operation.
* SQRL Login Technology (Simple Quick Reliable Login, pronounced “squirrel”) is an open, free, intellectual property unencumbered, complete and practical system to cryptographically authenticate the identity of individuals across a network (..) it can replace all other systems while offering dramatic improvements in usability and security.

<text>Kharagpur () is a semi-planned urban agglomeration and a major industrial city in the Paschim Medinipur district of West Bengal, India. It is the headquarters of the Kharagpur subdivision and the largest city of the district. It is located 120 km west of Kolkata. Kharagpur holds the oldest and biggest Indian Institute of Technology namely IIT Kharagpur. It has one of the largest railway workshops in India. Kharagpur Junction contains the fourth longest railway platform in the world (1072.5 m) and is the headquarter of the Kharagpur Division of the South Eastern Railways.

== History ==
Kharagpur received its name from the twelfth king of the Mallabhum dynasty, Kharga Malla, when he conquered it. Kharagpur was a part of the Hijli Kingdom and ruled by Hindu Odia rulers as a feudatory under Gajapati Kings of Odisha. Historians claim that in the 16th century, Kharagpur was still a small village surrounded by dense forests. The village was on high rocky barren land. The only inhabited settlement near Kharagpur was Hijli, a small island village on the banks of the Rasulpur River, in the delta of the Bay of Bengal. It developed into a port town in 1687. Hijli was also a province and it existed until 1886. It covered parts of Bengal and Orissa. It had important towns like Tamluk, Panskura, and Debra, along with the Kelghai and Haldi rivers on the north, south, and east sides bounded by Bay of Bengal and Kharagpur, Keshiary, Dantan, and Jaleswar on the west.

Hijli was ruled by Taj Khan who was the disciple of Guru Peer Mackdram Sha Chisti. It was also ruled by the Kushan, Gupta, and Pal dynasties, and by the Mughals. It is said that Hijli had excellent business and trade centers with judiciary, prison, and administrative offices during the reign of Hindu kings and during the Mughal Raj. The capital of Hijli was in Bahiri up to 1628 and was shifted to Hijli afterwards. Hijli Province was at its peak in 1754 and was highly prosperous during this period.

Captain Nicolson was the first English colonialist to invade Hijli and captured the port. In 1687 Job Charnock with soldiers and warships captured Hijli, defeating Hindu and Mughal defenders. After the war with the Mughals, a treaty was signed between Job Charnock and the Mughal Emperor. The loss suffered by Job Charnock forced him to leave Hijli and to proceed towards Uluberia, while the Mughal Emperor continued to rule the province. From there, they finally settled at Sutanuti in Kolkata to establish their business in Eastern India. This was the start of the East India Company in India. Hijli as we know it today is only a small part of the Hijli Province, and was created for establishing administrative offices by the British in the 19th century. It is curious that almost the entire Kharagpur division of today has boundaries identical to Hijli Province.

In the 18th century Khejuri, another port town was set up on the banks of the Koukhali River in the delta region. It was established by the British primarily for carrying out trade with European countries. Khejuri was also an island. In the devastating cyclone of 1864, both ports were destroyed. The islands have since merged with the mainland.

==Transport==
=== Railways ===
The first railway establishment at Kharagpur started with the commissioning of the rail link between Cuttack – Balasore – Kharagpur and from Sini to Kolaghat via Kharagpur. Kharagpur as a junction station was established in Railway map in December 1898. The public mood and the reaction of society on introduction of rail transport in this region has been nicely depicted by the famous Bengali Novelist Dr Ramapada Chowdhury (who was born and raised in Kharagpur) in his novel &quot;Prothom Prohor.&quot; (1954) It is said that the people were initially afraid to travel by train for fear of the bridge collapsing, and for fear of getting &quot;outcaste&quot; or Dalit status, since there were no separate seating arrangement for different castes and religions. However, things changed due to famines in the early 20th century. The railway company came forward and offered jobs to the local unemployed men, gave them free rides on trains, and even offered blankets to those travelling by train. This promotional scheme broke the taboos and made rail transport acceptable to this society.

Midnapur&#x27;s District Headquarters was connected to the bank of the Kosai River in February 1900. Construction of the bridge over Kosai completed in June 1901. The rail line from Howrah to Kolaghat up to the Eastern bank and from Kharagpur up to Western bank of Rupnarayan River was completed in 1899. However, trains between Howrah and Kharagpur were possible only in April 1900 after the bridge over Rupnarayan River was completed.

Howrah – Amta light Railway (2 ft gauge - 610 mm) line was completed in 1898 and was operated by M/s Martin &amp; Co. of Calcutta. This link remained operative till 1971. After closure of the light railways, the demand for a broad gauge line between Howrah and Amta gained momentum. The project was completed in four phases. In the first phase, the line between Santragachi and Domjur was completed in 1984. In the second phase it got extended up to Bargachia in 1985, and later up to Munsirhat. Mahendralal Nagar station was completed in 2000, and the final leg to Amta was completed in December 2004.

Former captain of Indian Cricket team Mahendra Singh Dhoni also worked as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur Railway station from 2000 to 2003 before commencing his cricket career playing for India.

The need for a rail link between Panskura and Tamluk was conceived at the beginning of the 20th century, almost at the same time the rail link between Howrah and Kharagpur was opened. The railway company received offers for construction from two Agencies, M/s Martin &amp; Company and M/s Babu Nibaran Chandra Dutta, the former against a guaranteed return of 3.5% while the latter with none. Although the offer of the latter was lucrative, the dilemma of whether to offer the work of construction to a native or not forced the project to be abandoned. After Independence, the requirement of rail link connecting Panskura and Durgachak came up primarily for the purpose of constructing the Haldia Port. The rail link between Panskura – Durgachak via Tamluk completed in 1968, which was later extended to Haldia in 1975. Extension of the rail link to Digha from Tamluk was sanctioned in 1984; it took 20 years to complete, set in two phases. The first phase linked Tamluk and Contai in November 2003, and the tourist destination Digha was connected to Howrah in December 2004.

Geographical location of Kharagpur and its rail links with the rest of the country favored the construction of a centralized workshop with facilities to carry out major repairs of all broad gauge stock. The work was sanctioned in 1900; construction of the workshop was completed in 1904.

Kharagpur has Asia&#x27;s largest railway Solid State Interlocking (SSI) system.

The Railways also plan to have an East Coast Dedicated Freight Corridor stretching from Kharagpur in West Bengal to Vijayawada of Andhra Pradesh.

==Healthcare==

The need for a centralized Hospital at Khargpur was also felt in the late 19th century. Subsequently, a Hospital with complete medical facilities was established in 1897. Dr Arthur Martin-Leake, Victorian Cross winner was appointed as Chief Medical Officer of Kharagpur Hospital in 1904. However the town still needs good private hospitals and advanced medication and healthcare facilities as in current situation its citizens have to depend on Kolkata for treatment, which is at a distance of 132 km.

Today, the Railway Main Hospital and Kharagpur Sub-divisional Hospital (&quot;Chandmari Hospital&quot;) are main public sector hospitals in Kharagpur. Recently, since the city lies at an important junction of state and national highways, a Trauma Care Centre of level - 3 category is being set up in Kharagpur Sub-divisional Hospital. A number of private clinics and nursing homes also operate here.

Dr. B. C. Roy Institute of Medical Science &amp; Research is a medical college and hospital near IIT Kharagpur.

<doc id="1112233" wikidata="Q7123315" url="?curid=1112233" title="Paddick">
<text>Paddick is a surname of English origin, later spreading to other English language countries. There are several origin theories: all may be true as there are distinct groupings of Paddicks across England.

The first group, from the Somerset, Dorset and Bristol area, is thought to derive from the Old English &quot;paddock&quot; meaning an enclosed or fenced area of land.

The second group comes from the English Midlands, particularly Shropshire and Staffordshire, though also through time from Birmingham and Lancashire. This name, although most commonly written as &quot;Paddock&quot; rather than Paddick, was originally written as &quot;Parrock&quot; and derives from the same etymology as the word &quot;park&quot;. The vast majority of people with the last name Paddick or Paddock in England are descended from this group.

The third group is concentrated around the South East England coast, particularly in the counties of Hampshire and Sussex, and this group is a variant of the surname Padwick.

The following notable people have or had the surname Paddick:

*Brian Paddick (born 1958), former British police commander and candidate in 2008 for Mayor of London
*Hugh Paddick (1915–2000), British actor
*John Paddick (born 1943), British athlete
*Paul Paddick (born 1967), Australian children&#x27;s television presenter

<doc id="1112243" wikidata="Q6112002" url="?curid=1112243" title="Jack Dann">
<text>Jack Dann (born February 15, 1945) is an American writer best known for his science fiction, as well as an editor and a writing teacher, who has lived in Australia since 1994. He has published over seventy books, the majority being as editor or co-editor of story anthologies in the science fiction, fantasy and horror genres. He has published nine novels, numerous shorter works of fiction, essays, and poetry, and his books have been translated into thirteen languages. His work, which includes fiction in the science fiction, fantasy, horror, magical realism, and historical and alternative history genres, has been compared to Jorge Luis Borges, Roald Dahl, Lewis Carroll, J. G. Ballard, and Philip K. Dick.

==Life and career==

===Earlier life===
Jack Dann was born to a Jewish family in New York State in 1945 and grew up in Johnson City, New York. His father was an attorney and a judge. Dann describes himself as having been &quot;a troublesome child in a very small town&quot;, and in his teens associated with a local gang. Following an incident during which gang members let off fireworks, which led to injuries, his parents enrolled him in a military academy, which he chose against the alternative option of a reform school, and where he remained for two years.

Subsequently, he commenced theater studies at Hofstra University in New York City. However, in 1965 he contracted peritonitis after a poorly performed operation for appendicitis. He was considered unlikely to survive by his doctors, and spent four months recovering in hospital, at one stage sharing a ward with members of the Mafia who had been injured in a gun battle. He attributes a major change in outlook to his survival, and began a search for a fulfilling and meaningful vocation, which eventually led to him taking up writing.

Following discharge from hospital, he moved to Binghamton, New York where he continued his studies. He was awarded a BA in social and political science in 1968 from Binghamton University and later undertook postgraduate studies in law at St John&#x27;s Law School from 1969 to 1971. He lived in Binghamton for much of the next 30 years. His long term loyalty to the town which persisted until his move to Australia in 1994 earned him the description of &#x27;the hermit of Binghamton&#x27; among his friends.

He was introduced to genre fiction, and in particular science fiction, from an early age, as his father had a collection of science fiction books which lined the walls of Dann&#x27;s bedroom and he recalls &quot;gazing at the colorful covers before I could read.&quot; In the late 1960s, he encountered a number of now well-known writers and editors in the science fiction and fantasy field, including George Zebrowski, Pamela Sargent, Gardner Dozois, Jack Haldeman and Joe Haldeman, two of whom, Zebrowski and Sargent, also lived in Binghamton and were students with Dann at Binghamton University (then known as SUNY Binghamton).

Dann was soon collaborating with Zebrowski, &quot;sitting on opposite sides of a table in his dining room and writing on an old manual typewriter&quot; and in 1970 sold two of these collaborations, &quot;Dark, Dark the Dead Star&quot; and &quot;Traps,&quot; to the magazine &quot;Worlds of If&quot;, with &#x27;Traps&#x27; being Dann&#x27;s first published work when it appeared in March 1970. Dann had previously sold a story to Damon Knight for &quot;Orbit&quot;, but this took almost two years to be published. Zebrowski also introduced Dann to the world of science fiction conventions and fandom, a culture he has been involved in ever since.

Initially he combined continued sales of his stories with work as a door-to-door salesman, which began after a commission for his first novel, &quot;Starhiker&quot;, was not finalized by his prospective publisher and he had become indebted, expecting payment for the piece. While continuing his writing, he moved on from sales to commence a business career, starting companies in the advertising, cable and insurance industries, among others and later working as a business consultant. He also taught writing at Cornell University in 1973.

He published his first book as editor, &quot;Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in 1974, and his first novel, &quot;Starhiker&quot;, in 1977.

===Move to Australia===
In 1994 he moved to Melbourne to join Janeen Webb, a Melbourne science fiction critic, academic, and writer, whom he met at a conference in San Francisco and married in 1995. It was the second marriage for each of them. He has since collaborated with Webb on several writing and editing projects and the couple are well known in Australian speculative fiction culture.

He currently lives on a farm overlooking the sea near Foster, in the Gippsland region of Victoria, but also typically spends some period of each year in Los Angeles and New York. In 2016 he received a Ph.D. from the University of Queensland, School of Communication and Arts. His dissertation was titled &quot;Shadows in the Stone and a Study of Historical Divergence&quot;.

==Work as an editor and anthologist==
He was editor of the SFWA Bulletin from 1970 to 1975. He was assistant editor 1970–1972, and managing editor 1973–1975. He has been a consulting editor for Tor Books since 1994.

Of the more than 70 books he has published, most have been themed fiction anthologies in the fantasy, science fiction, and horror genres, of which he has been editor, or co-editor. His anthologies tend to be prefaced by his essays on the theme of the anthology and the writers represented therein.

His first published anthology was &quot;Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (1974), collecting stories by Jewish Authors and/or relating to Jewish themes. The volume celebrated a strong Jewish tradition of fantasy in literature and also brought attention to Jewish writers in the field, some of whom had not been previously widely recognised for their contributions to its genesis. It was one of the most acclaimed American anthologies of the 1970s, and was later followed by &quot;More Wandering Stars: Outstanding Stories of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; (1981). Dann also co-edited, with Grania Davidson Davis, &quot;Everybody Has Somebody in Heaven: Essential Jewish Tales of the Spirit&quot;, a collection of short fiction by Avram Davidson, a Hugo and multi World Fantasy Award-winning Jewish American writer of science fiction, fantasy and crime, which was published in October 2000.

In 1987 he published &quot;In the Field of Fire&quot;, co-editing with then wife, Jeanne Van Buren, a collection of science fiction and fantasy stories relating to the horrors of the Vietnam War. It was nominated for Best Anthology in the 1988 World Fantasy and Locus awards. The collection was the first science fiction anthology to have a review featured on the front page of the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot;.

In 1998 he published an anthology of Australian science fiction and fantasy &quot;Dreaming Down-Under&quot; co-editing with wife Janeen Webb. It won Australia&#x27;s Ditmar Award and is the first Australian fiction book ever to win the prestigious World Fantasy Award. (Donald H. Tuck&#x27;s 1979 award was for a non-fiction work).

In August 2003 he published &quot;Gathering the Bones&quot;, as co-editor with Ramsey Campbell and Dennis Etchison, a collection of horror stories from the United Kingdom, The US and Australia, which was included in Library Journal&#x27;s &quot;Best Genre Fiction of 2003&quot; and was shortlisted for the World Fantasy Award.

He has also published, as editor, a further volume of Australian speculative fiction &quot;Dreaming Again&quot;, anthologies of Nebula Award winning stories, and many other anthologies, both singularly and in collaboration with others.

===&quot;Magic Tales&quot; anthologies===

Many of his anthologies have been editorial collaborations with Gardner Dozois. Of these, the most extensive series has been the &quot;Magic Tales&quot; anthologies, initially published by Ace Books and commencing with &quot;Unicorns!&quot; in 1982. Across over 30 volumes, this series collected and republished short stories centering on a number of fantasy and science fiction themes, such as aliens, mermaids, dinosaurs, dragons, and clones. The selected stories tend to be reprints of previously published works, and some are decades old. Each book has a preface by the editors, and each story is preceded by a short introduction, focusing on other works by the story&#x27;s author.

==Writing career==

===Shorter works of fiction===
Short stories, novelettes and novellas have comprised the vast majority of his fiction and over 100 of these, in multiple genres, have been published across his writing career. His short stories have appeared in &quot;Omni&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; and other major magazines and anthologies and have been collected in &quot;Timetipping&quot; (1980), the retrospective short story collection &quot;Jubilee: the Essential Jack Dann&quot; (2001), including an introduction and notes by Dann and &quot;Visitations&quot; (2003).

Major shorter works include: &#x27;Junction&#x27;, a novella, later expanded into a novel, published in &quot;Fantastic Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories 23&quot; in November 1973; &#x27;The Dybbuk Dolls&#x27;, published in &quot;New Dimensions of Science Fiction Number 5&quot; in 1975, a fantastic tale portraying Jews in a dystopian future United States; &#x27;Camps&#x27;, published in &quot;Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; in May 1979, a story of a terminally ill young man who experiences another man&#x27;s past in a concentration camp, part-based on Dann&#x27;s own brush with death in his youth; &#x27;Down among the Dead Men&#x27;, published in &quot;Oui&quot; on 11 July 1982 and co written by Gardner Dozois, also focusing on a concentration camp - the story was awarded the Premios Gilgames de Narrativa Fantastica award; &#x27;Bad Medicine&#x27;, published in &quot;Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot; in October 1986, an except from his novel &quot;Counting Coup&quot;, substantially revised.

His novella &#x27;Da Vinci Rising&#x27;, using sections of novel &quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot; together with approximately 5,000 words of new writing won the Nebula Award in 1996 and short story &#x27;Niagara Falling&#x27;, co written by Janeen Webb was awarded the Aurealis Award in 1998.

===Novels===
His first four novels were science fiction or variants thereon. As from the &quot;Memory Cathedral&quot; (1995), further novels have been alternate history and/or magical realism. In keeping with a practice not uncommon among science fiction writers, his bibliography shows several of his novels having been preceded by the publication of shorter works of varying length, which are progenitors, partial serialisations or extracts from his eventual full length published books.

Reading guides for Dann&#x27;s novels &quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot;, &quot;The Rebel: An Imagined Life of James Dean&quot;, &quot;The Silent&quot;, and &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; are available on the Dann&#x27;s author page on the website of publisher HarperCollinsAustralia. Each guide includes reflections by the author on writing the book, questions for use with reading groups, and a list of books for further reading on the setting or related issues.

====&quot;Starhiker&quot; (1977)====
His first novel describes the cosmic voyage of Bo, a young man with an itinerant outlook, who is the inhabitant of a future Earth which has little importance in galactic affairs, and is under extraterrestrial occupation by the Hrau, principally for use as relay station for galactic spacecraft. Bo boards one of these craft and hence encounters a range of confronting and transcendent experiences, often with a dreamlike quality, before eventually returning to his home.

Sections of &quot;Starhiker&quot; were serialized as two novellas in &quot;Amazing&quot; from June–September 1976, prior to the publication of the full novel version. It was translated into German, and published as &quot;Welten-Vagabund&quot; in 1979.

====&quot;Junction&quot; (1981)====
The novel begins in a small town in the 19th-century fashioned Midwestern United States, which is separated from reality: apparently it is the only human settlement left on Earth, now situated close to Hell. Protagonist Ned Wheeler leaves the town, undertaking a journey into hell and emerging in a 20th-century New York where many have dreamt of him prior to his arrival.

Science fiction writer Philip K. Dick was greatly impressed with the novel, commenting: &quot;&quot;Junction&quot; is where Ursula Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;The Lathe of Heaven&quot; and Tony Boucher&#x27;s &quot;The Quest for Saint Aquin&quot; meet... and yet it is an entirely new novel ... I may very well be basing some of my future work on &quot;Junction&quot;.&quot;

A novella version of &quot;Junction&quot; was published in &quot;Fantastic&quot; in November 1973. It was nominated for the 1974 Nebula Award and Locus Award. Dann reworked this tale for some years through a number of drafts, publishing a further section entitled &quot;Islands of Time&quot; in &quot;Fantastic&quot; in September 1977. Finally the sections were combined with further material to form the full novel published in 1981. It was translated into German by Rainer Schmidt and published as &quot;Grenzland der Hölle&quot; in 1985.

====&quot;The Man Who Melted&quot; (1984)====
Set in the 21st Century, it presents a post-apocalyptic world in which telepathic shock waves – an outbreak of collective fear from the unconscious of millions - have led to widespread destruction and the reduction of many human beings to inhuman &quot;screamers&quot;. The protagonist, Raymond Mantle, searches through this shattered world for his wife, whose absence from his life he is aware of, but whose actual presence in his memories has been erased by the &quot;Scream&quot;. The novel also imagines a future where unfamiliar forms of consciousness, introduced by the new telepathic reality created by the &quot;Scream&quot;, have altered the nature of humanity and questionable moral practices have become common, including the commercial availability of suicide in scenarios such as a reenactment of the sinking of the Titanic and the option of gambling with one&#x27;s organs. Extrapolations in the book include a precocious vision of the Internet.

The novel attracted significant praise within the science fiction genre and was appreciated by both followers of humanistic and cyberpunk traditions in that field. It was compared to Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s film &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; by the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, and it was described as among the greatest science fiction novels by &quot;Science Fiction Age&quot;.

It was translated into French by Bernard Sigaud and published as &quot;La Grande Hurle&quot; in 1987, and also translated into German and published as &quot;Der Schmelzende Mensch&quot; in 1989.

It was nominated for best novel in the 1985 Nebula Award, and Best Science Fiction Novel in the 1985 Locus Award. Revised extracts and shorter versions were published under various titles, including the novella &quot;Amnesia&quot; which was published in &quot;The Berkley Showcase, Vol. 3: New Writings in Science Fiction and Fantasy&quot; in 1981 and was nominated for Nebula Award for Best Novella in 1982.

====&quot;High Steel&quot; (1993) with Jack C. Haldeman, II====
Set in a 22nd-century Earth overshadowed by mega-corporations, the novel follows John Stranger, a Native American who is forced from his reservation home by the Trans-United company to work in orbital space construction. Stranger&#x27;s shamanistic skills become prized by his employer to assist in a race against rival companies to decode an alien transmission containing blueprints for a faster-than-light space drive.

The novel was an expanded version of the novelette &quot;Echoes of Thunder&quot;, which was published in a Tor Double Novel volume with Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Run for the Stars&quot; in 1991. Dann is working on a sequel entitled &quot;Ghost Dance&quot; with author Barbara Delaplace. Delaplace is the wife of Jack C. Haldeman, II, who died in 2002.

====&quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot; (1995)====

Dann&#x27;s major historical novel depicts a version of the Renaissance in which Leonardo da Vinci actually constructs a number of his inventions, such as a flying machine, whose designs are well known from his surviving sketches. He later employs some of his military inventions during a battle in the Middle East, while in the service of a Syrian general – events which Dann projects into a year of da Vinci&#x27;s life about which little is known. The novel also presents a detailed imagining of the life and character of the inventor and painter during this period, and includes his encounters with other historical characters residing in Florence including Machiavelli and Botticelli.

The title refers to an ancient system of memory recall, or Mnemonics, in which a building, such as a cathedral, is constructed in the mind as a container for imagined objects - which are deliberately connected to particular memories. The building can later be mentally navigated to re-encounter those objects and retrieve the memories with which they are associated. Da Vinci&#x27;s memory cathedral functions in the narrative as a device through which he reviews his experiences as death approaches.

It was first published by Bantam Books in December 1995 and has been published in ten languages to date. It won the Australian Aurealis Award in 1997, was #1 on &quot;The Age&quot; bestseller list, and in 1996, a novella based on the novel, &quot;Da Vinci Rising,&quot; was awarded the Nebula Award for Best Novella. &quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot; was also shortlisted for the Audio Book of the Year, which was part of the 1998 Braille &amp; Talking Book Library Awards.
====&quot;The Silent&quot; (1998)====
Dann&#x27;s second historical novel adopts a first person perspective, and is written in the form of a journal produced by Edmund &quot;Mundy&quot; McDowell, a teenager in 1862 during the American Civil War, who writes as a form of therapy later in life – or possibly as a restless spirit. After his home is razed, and his mother raped and murdered by looters, he embarks upon a journey across wartime Virginia. The trauma of his experiences has rendered him mute, hence the title of the piece. It also colours his journey – which depicts the battlefield horrors of the American Civil War and its impact graphically - with visions of ghosts, spirits and an omnipresent &quot;spirit dog&quot; with symbolic resonances of the essence of warfare. 

====&quot;Bad Medicine&quot; (2000; also known as &quot;Counting Coup&quot;)====

This road trip novel relates the juvenile but revelatory antics of two men in their 60s, Charlie Sarris, an apartment supervisor and John Stone, a Native American medicine man, who meets Charlie when he moves into his apartment block. Both characters are deeply flawed, lamenting their lost youth and first discover kinship in their copious consumption of alcohol. After Charlie discovers that his teenage daughter is pregnant, and can little cope with the parental responsibilities this implies, he accompanies John on a trip to Florida, where John intends to confront his shamanistic rival, Whiteshirt. The journey is marked by indulgent, illegal and destructive behavior on the part of both men, apparently influenced by a curse placed upon John by Whiteshirt, which equally affects Charlie and leaves them acting ostensibly as caricatures of the worst aspects of their natures.

The novel was published several years after completion, after being delayed by the collapse of original publisher, Bluejay Books. A novelette version, a revised excerpt from the novel, was published by in &quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine 8&quot; in October 1984, and was shortlisted for Locus Award for Best Novelette, Nebula Award for Best Novelette and World Fantasy Award for Best Short Story in 1985.

====&quot;The Rebel: An Imagined Life of James Dean&quot; (2004)====
Following on from the secret history and alternate history approach used in &quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot; and &quot;The Silent&quot;, &quot;The Rebel&quot; supposes a version of the 1950s in which the actor James Dean survived his infamous fatal car crash, and goes on to become a major star, film director and later Governor of California. As with &quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot;, the novel includes encounters with a number of other iconic figures of the period, including Marilyn Monroe, the Kennedy family and Elvis Presley.

This novel is published by HarperCollins Flamingo in Australia and Morrow in the U.S. &quot;Locus&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;The Rebel&quot; is a significant and very gripping novel, a welcome addition to Jack Dann&#x27;s growing oeuvre of speculative historical novels, sustaining further his long-standing contemplation of the modalities of myth and memory. This is alternate history with passion and difference.&quot; A companion volume, &quot;Promised Land&quot;, appeared from PS Publishing in 2007 and further explores, through short stories and novellas, both elements of the actual and alternative 1950s setting as presented in the novel.

====&quot;The Economy of Light&quot; (2008)====
Michael Swanwick provided an introduction to this short horror novel about a retired Nazi hunter, whose siblings were murdered by Nazi prison doctor, Josef Mengele. He is propelled into an arduous and confronting journey into the Amazon jungle, in search of a rumored miracle working physician. This is instigated by the discovery of the purported remains of the infamous doctor, and the apparent need to purge the effects of a spiritual ailment, which strikes him at Mengele&#x27;s graveside, and may be the source of diseases with which he has become afflicted.

It was nominated for a 2008 Aurealis Award in the category of Best Horror Novel.

===Poetry===
He has published poetry in collections, magazines, in the form of poetry postcards and a chapbook &quot;Christs and Other Poems&quot; (1978). The greater number of publications have been in &quot;The Anthology of Speculative Poetry&quot; and &quot;Rod Serling Presents The Twilight Zone Magazine&quot;.

===Fiction collaborations===
Since his initial collaborations with George Zebrowski, also forming his first published work, Jack Dann has undertaken joint fiction projects with a number of authors, including Susan Caspar, Barry N. Malzberg, Gardner Dozois, Jack C. Haldeman II, Michael Swanwick and his wife, Janeen Webb. Dann and Webb&#x27;s 1997 story, &quot;Niagara Falling,&quot; won both the Aurealis Award and Ditmar Award for short fiction in 1998. Most collaborations have been in the short story form, and Dann published a collection of these in &quot;The Fiction Factory&quot; (2005). However, they have included novellas, and he has also written one novel with Jack C. Haldeman II, &quot;High Steel&quot; (1993). The majority of the book length publications with which he is associated are editorial collaborations.

==Writing==

===Style===
His stories are sometimes reminiscent in style to the work of Franz Kafka or Jorge Luis Borges and can be complex and challenging to the reader, with a considerable sense of mystery. They have great variety and are typically highly unpredictable. They often have a surreal, dreamlike or hallucinatory quality, playing with different types of reality. They may blur the distinction between subjective and objective viewpoints, with shifting conceptual landscapes and there is often a sense of nothing quite being what it seems. The language and the images used often have a poetic quality but his choice of expression is typically precise and can equally have considerable humor or a sense of darkness.

===Technique===
He is known for his meticulous and extensive research of his subjects and their relevant setting, which has been a salient feature of his alternative history novels such as &quot;The Memory Cathedral&quot;, &quot;The Rebel: an Imagined Life of James Dean&quot; and &quot;The Silent&quot;. In the case of &quot;The Rebel&quot;, novel, he read over 100 books relating to the 1950s setting. In keeping with the approach traditionally taken by scholars of history, he has expressed a preference for consulting primary sources, wherever possible. He has also suggested that &#x27;writer&#x27;s block&#x27; is not necessarily a negative experience, but an invitation from the subconscious to conduct more research, either through study, or through gathering and processing further life experiences, thus refilling the subconscious pool of material to fuel further creative work.

He studied in Method acting in the 1960s, a technique which involves total immersion into a character&#x27;s life, experiences, habits and outlook, and parallels this propensity for in depth research. He has made links between this training and his approach to developing his fictional characters. In the case of his novel &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;, which includes a character who is a Native American medicine man, he spent a year with the Sioux People, and participated in traditional ceremonies.

He advocates the development of writing technique through rigorous writing workshops, where emerging writers are guided by established writers, which he feels is a fast track to gaining a professional writing style. He attributes the emergence of a number of talented writers in the science fiction field to this process and also suggests that his own writing has been shaped by his participation these types of events, including the Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop. Since becoming an established writer, he has taught writing and run workshops on a regular basis.

===Genre===
He has written in multiple genres and has indicated that he enjoys and embraces the particular qualities and tropes of these genres, but does not see himself as confined to a particular genre when embarking on a writing project and may include aspects of a number of genres in a particular work. He views genres primarily as marketing categories, helping to guide readers towards fiction of interest to them and also useful in helping a writer to build up and sustain an audience for their work. His fiction typically challenges the divide between literary and speculative fiction and can show equal resonances of writers in both traditions.

===Themes===
Charisma, memory, myth, witnessing the reality of The Holocaust and transformation are all themes in Dann&#x27;s work he has either identified himself or have been highlighted by reviewers and commentators. His stories often deal with achieving transcendent states, undertaking spiritual journeys or encountering confronting experiences that dramatically alter the psyche. Many involve young men who are liberated from naive origins by journeys marked by alien, revelatory or otherwise confrontational experiences which transform them, leaving them with a greater connection and awareness of their general environment or wider fields of consciousness. His first and second published novels, &quot;Starhiker&quot; and &quot;Junction&quot; and a significant number of his short stories are examples of this trend. He has linked this preoccupation with his experience of coming close to death as a young man, following his hospitalisation in 1965, which he claims had a similar transformational effect on his character.

Dann is also notable in the science fiction field for having written a number of stories with Jewish themes. Dann has a Jewish background, and although affirming an affinity with the cultural aspects of this, has distanced himself from the theological tenets of Judaism due to his atheist outlook.

===Influences===
Dann has acknowledged the influence of a range of writers, including Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel García Márquez, J.D. Salinger and J.G. Ballard. He has suggested particular influence from Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s memoir of his &#x27;down and out&#x27; days in Paris in the early 1920s, &quot;A Moveable Feast.&quot; Dann read this book during his convalescence from life-threatening illness in 1965, a key character forming event in his personal history.

<text>A tank gun is the main armament of a tank. Modern tank guns are high-velocity, large-caliber artilleries capable of firing kinetic energy penetrators, high-explosive anti-tank, and cannon-launched guided projectiles. Anti-aircraft guns can also be mounted to tanks.

As the tank&#x27;s primary armament, they are almost always employed in a direct fire mode to defeat a variety of ground targets at all ranges, including dug-in infantry, lightly armored vehicles, and especially other heavily armored tanks. They must provide accuracy, range, penetration, and rapid fire in a package that is as compact and lightweight as possible, to allow mounting in the cramped confines of an armored gun turret. Tank guns generally use self-contained ammunition, allowing rapid loading (or use of an autoloader). They often display a bulge in the barrel, which is a bore evacuator, or a device on the muzzle, which is a muzzle brake.

==History==

===World War I===

The first tanks were used to break through trench defences in support of infantry actions particularly machine gun positions during the First World War and they were fitted with machine guns or high explosive firing guns of modest calibre. These were naval or field artillery pieces stripped from their carriages and mounted in sponsons or casemates on armored vehicles. 

The early British Mark I tanks of 1916 used two naval 57 mm QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss mounted either side in sponsons. These guns proved too long for use in the British tank designs as they would come into contact with obstacles and the ground on uneven terrain, and the succeeding Mark IV tank of 1917 was equipped with the shortened 6 pounder 6 cwt version which can be considered the first specialised tank gun. 

The first German tank, the A7V, used British-made 57 mm Maxim-Nordenfelt fortification guns captured from Belgium and Russia, mounted singly at the front. 

The early French Schneider CA1 mounted a short 75 mm gun in a sponson on the right hand side, while the Saint-Chamond mounted a standard 75 mm field gun in the nose. The thin armour of the tanks meant that such weapons were effective against other vehicles, though the Germans fielded few tanks anyway and the Allied tanks concentrated on anti-infantry and infantry support activities.

===World War II===
This thinking remained pervasive into the dawn of World War II, when most tank guns were still modifications of existing artillery pieces, and were expected to primarily be used against unarmored targets. The larger caliber, shorter range artillery mounting did not go away however. Tanks intended specifically for infantry support (the infantry tanks), expected to take out emplacements and infantry concentrations, carried large calibre weapons to fire large high-explosive shells—though these could be quite effective against other vehicles at close ranges. In some designs – for example, M3 Lee, Churchill, Char B1 – the larger bore weapons were mounted within the tank hull while a second gun for use against tanks was fitted in a turret.

However, other strategists saw new roles for tanks in war, and wanted more specifically developed guns tailored to these missions. The ability to destroy enemy tanks was foremost on their minds. To this end, the emerging anti-tank gun designs were modified to fit tanks. These weapons fired smaller shells, but at higher velocities with higher accuracy, improving their performance against armor. Such light guns as the QF 2-pounder (40 mm) and 37 mm equipped British cruiser tanks and infantry tanks in the late 1930s. These weapons lacked a good high-explosive shell for attacking infantry and fortifications, but were effective against the light armor of the time.

World War II saw a leapfrog growth in all areas of military technology. Battlefield experience led to increasingly powerful weapons being adopted. Guns with calibres from 20 mm to 40 mm soon gave way to 50 mm, 75 mm, 85 mm, 88 mm, 90 mm, and 122 mm calibre. In 1939, the standard German &quot;panzer&quot; had either a 20 mm or 37 mm medium-velocity weapon, but by 1945 long-barrelled 75 mm and 88 mm high-velocity guns were common. The Soviets introduced their 122 mm in a turreted heavy tank series, the IS tanks. Shells were improved to provide better penetration with harder materials and scientific shaping. All of these meant improvements in accuracy and range, although the average tank had to grow as well to carry the ammunition, mounting, and protection for these powerful guns.

While high velocity tank guns were effective against other tanks, for the most part British tanks moved to a dual purpose 75 mm gun capable of firing a useful HE shell; later in the war adding 76 mm 17pdr gun armed tanks for better antitank capability.

Many nations devised &quot;tank destroyers&quot; during the war – a vehicle specifically designed for anti-tank work, and armed more heavily than a tank on the same chassis could be. They generally fell into three overlapping categories: improvised modifications of old or captured tanks to render them viable again (such as converting the machine-gun-only Panzer I into the Panzerjäger I), often with haphazard, poorly protected, limited-traverse weapon mounts; the American offensive and mobile reserve model, which favoured lightly-armed open-top vehicles with a rotating turret and a powerful anti-tank-capable gun while relegating true tanks to infantry support role (exemplified by the M10 tank destroyer); and the casemate gun mount model, which often allowed the resultant vehicle to be hard to hit and have a well-sloped and heavily armoured glacis plate (for instance, the SU-100). The relative superiority in armament of tank destroyers was only relative, however: for instance, the SU-85 was a casemate-type TD on the T-34 chassis that was rendered obsolete once the basic T-34 switched from the 76 mm gun to the same 85 mm cannon, producing the T-34-85.

=== After World War II ===

By the end of the war the variety in tank designs had narrowed and the concept of the main battle tank emerged. The race to increase caliber slowed, with just slight increases between tank generations. In the West, guns of around 90 mm gave way to the ubiquitous 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7, introduced in 1958. This lasted a long while, with a shift to 120 mm in the late 1970s and early 1980s (the UK changed in the late 1960s with their Chieftain tank). In the East, the 85 mm quickly yielded to the 100 mm and 115 mm U-5TS gun, with the 125 mm caliber now standard. Most of the improvements were instead made in ammunition and fire-control systems.

With kinetic energy penetrator rounds, solid shot and armour-piercing shell gave way to armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) (a product of 1944), and fin-stabilized (APFSDS) rounds with tungsten or depleted uranium penetrators. Parallel developments brought rounds based on chemical energy; high-explosive squash head (HESH), and shaped-charge high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT), with penetrating power independent of muzzle velocity or range.


Stadiametric range-finders were successively replaced by coincidence and laser rangefinders. Accuracy of modern tank guns is improved over earlier weapons by computerized fire-control systems, wind sensors, thermal sleeves, and muzzle referencing systems which compensate for barrel warping, wear and temperature. Fighting capability at night, in poor weather, and smoke was improved by infrared, light-intensification, and thermal imaging equipment.

Technology of the guns themselves has had only a few innovations. For decades the guns were almost exclusively rifled, but now most new tanks have smoothbore guns. Rifling in the barrel imparts spin on the projectile to stabilized it, improving ballistic accuracy. The best traditional antitank weapons have been kinetic energy rounds, whose penetrating power and accuracy is greatly decreased with the loss in muzzle velocity at extended range. For longer ranges high-explosive anti-tank rounds are more effective, but accuracy is limited; for extremely long ranges cannon-launched guided projectiles (CLGPs) are considered more accurate.

The use of the autoloader has been a development favoured by some nations and not others. Some countries adopted it as a means to keep the overall size of the tank down. Interest has also been shown as a means to protect the crew by separating them further from the gun and ammunition. For example, an autoloader allows the use of an unmanned turret in the T-14 Armata.

==Smoothbore==
In the 1960s, smoothbore tank guns were developed by the United States, the Soviet Union, and later by the experimental American-West German MBT-70 joint project. 

High-precision smoothbore tank gun barrels were perfected by the US Army&#x27;s Weapons Laboratory at the Watervliet Arsenal based on a pair of patents by inventor Albert L. de Graffenried. More than 20,000 tank cannons were manufactured by the Watervliet Arsenal for the US Abrams M1A1 tank using de Graffenried&#x27;s patented high-precision manufacturing inventions.

Based on their experience with the 2A28 Grom gun/missile system of the BMP-1, the Soviets produced the T-64B main battle tank, with an auto-loaded 2A46 125 mm smoothbore high-velocity tank gun, capable of firing APFSDS ammunition as well as ATGMs. Similar guns continue to be used in the latest Russian T-90, Ukrainian T-84, and Serbian M-84AS MBTs. 

The German company Rheinmetall developed a more conventional 120 mm smoothbore tank gun which can fire LAHAT missiles, adopted for the Leopard 2, and later the U.S. M1 Abrams. The chief advantages of smoothbore designs are their greater suitability for fin stabilised ammunition and their greatly reduced barrel wear compared with rifled designs. Much of the difference in operation between smoothbore and rifled guns shows in the type of secondary ammunition that they fire, with a smoothbore gun being ideal for firing HEAT rounds (although specially designed HEAT rounds can be fired from rifled guns) and rifling being necessary to fire HESH rounds.

Most modern main battle tanks now carry a smoothbore gun. A notable exception are the tanks of the British Army which used the 120 mm Royal Ordnance L11A5 rifled gun until the 1990s; it was then replaced it with the 120 mm L30 rifled gun which remains in service. The Indian Arjun tank uses an Indian-developed 120 mm rifled gun.

<doc id="1112265" wikidata="Q4016227" url="?curid=1112265" title="Chicago VII">
<text>Chicago VII is the sixth studio album by American rock band Chicago. It was released on March 11, 1974 by Columbia Records. It is notable for being their first double album of new material since 1971&#x27;s &quot;Chicago III&quot; and remains their final studio release in that format. It features session percussionist Laudir de Oliveira, who would become a full-fledged band member for the release of &quot;Chicago VIII&quot; the following year.

==Background==
While touring in support of &quot;Chicago VI&quot; in 1973, the band began getting restless and started integrating some lengthy jazz instrumentals into their sets. While audiences&#x27; reactions varied, Chicago greatly enjoyed the experience, decided (after years of talking about it) to record a pure jazz-influenced set of tracks, and headed straight to producer James William Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Ranch studios to cut their ambitious new album.

While the sessions began well, there was soon dissension within the group about the jazz project, with, reportedly, Peter Cetera and Guercio both wary of the commercial risk of such an undertaking. While the band reasoned that some of the jazzy material was too good to throw away, the others finally relented and accepted including the more pop and rock-oriented songs that the band had composed in the meantime. Almost by accident, Chicago had another double album on their hands.

Of the more conventional material, Chicago once again turned in a varied set of songs, with Terry Kath&#x27;s &quot;Byblos&quot;, named after a club that Chicago had played in Osaka, Japan, ranking among his best efforts. Robert Lamm, who was recording a solo album entitled &quot;Skinny Boy&quot; at the time, turned in several new songs, even donating his solo album&#x27;s title track, featuring The Pointer Sisters on backing vocals. James Pankow came through with another success, &quot;(I&#x27;ve Been) Searchin&#x27; So Long&quot; (#9), and trumpeter Lee Loughnane succeeded on his first try at songwriting with the hit &quot;Call on Me&quot; (#6). Peter Cetera made the biggest strides on &quot;Chicago VII&quot;, composing &quot;Happy Man&quot; and &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot; (#11), a lush ballad (signs of the future, taking the band even farther from their original style and sound) that features three of The Beach Boys on backing vocals and which became a big hit in late 1974. &quot;Happy Man&quot; was subsequently covered by Tony Orlando and Dawn on their album &quot;To Be With You&quot;. Peter Cetera also covered &quot;Happy Man&quot; in 1995 on his solo album &quot;One Clear Voice&quot; and again in 2005 on his solo album &quot;Faithfully&quot; which is a re-release of &quot;One Clear Voice&quot;.

&quot;Chicago VII&quot; is notable for having writing contributions from all (and only) the members of the band, and for having most of the members stretching out in new ways: Loughnane sang lead (&quot;Song of the Evergreens&quot;) and wrote a song, Pankow sang backup, Kath played bass, Cetera played guitar, and Walter Parazaider and Danny Seraphine composed.

Released in March 1974, &quot;Chicago VII&quot; - despite its first disc being almost exclusively jazz instrumentals - reached #1 in the US, becoming another big success for the band.

The album was mixed and released in both stereo and quadraphonic. In 2002, &quot;Chicago VII&quot; was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records with one bonus track: an early rehearsal of Kath&#x27;s &quot;Byblos&quot;. Initial pressings of this edition contained an edited version of the track &quot;Happy Man&quot; that had appeared on &quot;Greatest Hits, Volume II&quot;, which omitted the &quot;false start&quot; and studio countdown heard on the original &quot;Chicago VII&quot; LP.

<doc id="1112273" wikidata="Q902126" url="?curid=1112273" title="Heat of combustion">
<text>The heating value (or energy value or calorific value) of a substance, usually a fuel or food (see food energy), is the amount of heat released during the combustion of a specified amount of it.

The &quot;calorific value&quot; is the total energy released as heat when a substance undergoes complete combustion with oxygen under standard conditions. The chemical reaction is typically a hydrocarbon or other organic molecule reacting with oxygen to form carbon dioxide and water and release heat. It may be expressed with the quantities:

* energy/mole of fuel 
* energy/mass of fuel
* energy/volume of the fuel

There are two kinds of enthalpy of combustion, called high(er) and low(er) heat(ing) value, depending on how much the products are allowed to cool and whether compounds like are allowed to condense.
The high heat values are conventionally measured with a bomb calorimeter. Low heat values are calculated from high heat value test data. They may also be calculated as the difference between the heat of formation Δ&quot;H&quot; of the products and reactants (though this approach is somewhat artificial since most heats of formation are typically calculated from measured heats of combustion)..

For a fuel of composition C&quot;c&quot;H&quot;h&quot;O&quot;o&quot;N&quot;n&quot;, the (higher) heat of combustion is usually to a good approximation (±3%), though it gives poor results for some compounds such as (gaseous) formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, and can be significantly off if , such as for glycerine dinitrate, .

By convention, the (higher) heat of combustion is defined to be the heat released for the complete combustion of a compound in its standard state to form stable products in their standard states: hydrogen is converted to water (in its liquid state), carbon is converted to carbon dioxide gas, and nitrogen is converted to nitrogen gas. That is, the heat of combustion, Δ&quot;H&quot;°comb, is the heat of reaction of the following process: 

: (std.) + (&quot;c&quot; + - ) (g) → &quot;c&quot; (g) + (&quot;l&quot;) + (g) 

Chlorine and sulfur are not quite standardized; they are usually assumed to convert to hydrogen chloride gas and or gas, respectively, or to dilute aqueous hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, respectively, when the combustion is conducted in a bomb calorimeter containing some quantity of water.

== Ways of determination ==
===Gross and net===
Zwolinski and Wilhoit defined, in 1972, &quot;gross&quot; and &quot;net&quot; values for heats of combustion. In the gross definition the products are the most stable compounds, e.g. (l), (l), (s) and (l). In the net definition the products are the gases produced when the compound is burned in an open flame, e.g. (g), (g), (g) and (g). In both definitions the products for C, F, Cl and N are (g), (g), (g) and (g), respectively.

===Dulong&#x27;s Formula===

The heating value of a fuel can be calculated with the results of ultimate analysis of fuel. From analysis, percentages of the combustibles in the fuel (carbon, hydrogen, sulfur) are known. Since the heat of combustion of these elements is known, the heating value can be calculated using Dulong&#x27;s Formula:

HHV [kJ/g]= 33.87mC + 122.3(mH - mO ÷ 8) + 9.4mS

where mC, mH, mO, mN, and mS are the contents of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur on any (wet, dry or ash free) basis, respectively.

=== Higher heating value ===
The higher heating value (HHV; &quot;gross energy&quot;, &quot;upper heating value&quot;, &quot;gross calorific value&quot; &quot;GCV&quot;, or &quot;higher calorific value&quot;; &quot;HCV&quot;) indicates the upper limit of the available thermal energy produced by a complete combustion of fuel. It is measured as a unit of energy per unit mass or volume of substance. The HHV is determined by bringing all the products of combustion back to the original pre-combustion temperature, including condensing any vapor produced. Such measurements often use a standard temperature of . This is the same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion since the enthalpy change for the reaction assumes a common temperature of the compounds before and after combustion, in which case the water produced by combustion is condensed to a liquid. The higher heating value takes into account the latent heat of vaporization of water in the combustion products, and is useful in calculating heating values for fuels where condensation of the reaction products is practical (e.g., in a gas-fired boiler used for space heat). In other words, HHV assumes all the water component is in liquid state at the end of combustion (in product of combustion) and that heat delivered at temperatures below can be put to use.

=== Lower heating value ===
The lower heating value (LHV; &quot;net calorific value&quot;; &quot;NCV&quot;, or &quot;lower calorific value&quot;; &quot;LCV&quot;) is another measure of available thermal energy produced by a combustion of fuel, measured as a unit of energy per unit mass or volume of substance. In contrast to the HHV, the LHV considers energy losses such as the energy used to vaporize wateralthough its exact definition is not uniformly agreed upon. One definition is simply to subtract the heat of vaporization of the water from the higher heating value. This treats any H2O formed as a vapor that is released as a waste. The energy required to vaporize the water is therefore lost.

LHV calculations assume that the water component of a combustion process is in vapor state at the end of combustion, as opposed to the higher heating value (HHV) (a.k.a. &quot;gross calorific value&quot; or &quot;gross CV&quot;) which assumes that all of the water in a combustion process is in a liquid state after a combustion process.

Another definition of the LHV is the amount of heat released when the products are cooled to . This means that the latent heat of vaporization of water and other reaction products is not recovered. It is useful in comparing fuels where condensation of the combustion products is impractical, or heat at a temperature below cannot be put to use.

One definition of lower heating value, adopted by the American Petroleum Institute (API), uses a reference temperature of .

Another definition, used by Gas Processors Suppliers Association (GPSA) and originally used by API (data collected for API research project 44), is the enthalpy of all combustion products minus the enthalpy of the fuel at the reference temperature (API research project 44 used 25 °C. GPSA currently uses 60 °F), minus the enthalpy of the stoichiometric oxygen (O2) at the reference temperature, minus the heat of vaporization of the vapor content of the combustion products.

The definition in which the combustion products are all returned to the reference temperature is more easily calculated from the higher heating value than when using other definitions and will in fact give a slightly different answer.

=== Gross heating value ===
Gross heating value accounts for water in the exhaust leaving as vapor, as does LHV, but gross heating value also includes liquid water in the fuel prior to combustion. This value is important for fuels like wood or coal, which will usually contain some amount of water prior to burning.

== Measuring heating values ==
The higher heating value is experimentally determined in a bomb calorimeter. The combustion of a stoichiometric mixture of fuel and oxidizer (e.g. two moles of hydrogen and one mole of oxygen) in a steel container at is initiated by an ignition device and the reactions allowed to complete. When hydrogen and oxygen react during combustion, water vapor is produced. The vessel and its contents are then cooled to the original 25 °C and the higher heating value is determined as the heat released between identical initial and final temperatures.

When the lower heating value (LHV) is determined, cooling is stopped at 150 °C and the reaction heat is only partially recovered. The limit of 150 °C is based on acid gas dew-point.

Note: Higher heating value (HHV) is calculated with the product of water being in liquid form while lower heating value (LHV) is calculated with the product of water being in vapor form.

== Relation between heating values ==
The difference between the two heating values depends on the chemical composition of the fuel. In the case of pure carbon or carbon monoxide, the two heating values are almost identical, the difference being the sensible heat content of carbon dioxide between 150 °C and 25 °C (sensible heat exchange causes a change of temperature, while latent heat is added or subtracted for phase transitions at constant temperature. Examples: heat of vaporization or heat of fusion). For hydrogen, the difference is much more significant as it includes the sensible heat of water vapor between 150 °C and 100 °C, the latent heat of condensation at 100 °C, and the sensible heat of the condensed water between 100 °C and 25 °C. In all, the higher heating value of hydrogen is 18.2% above its lower heating value (142MJ/kg vs. 120MJ/kg). For hydrocarbons, the difference depends on the hydrogen content of the fuel. For gasoline and diesel the higher heating value exceeds the lower heating value by about 10% and 7%, respectively, and for natural gas about 11%.

A common method of relating HHV to LHV is:
: formula_1
where &quot;H&quot;v is the heat of vaporization of water, &quot;n&quot;,out is the number of moles of water vaporized and &quot;n&quot;fuel,in is the number of moles of fuel combusted.

* Most applications that burn fuel produce water vapor, which is unused and thus wastes its heat content. In such applications, the lower heating value must be used to give a &#x27;benchmark&#x27; for the process. 
* However, for true energy calculations in some specific cases, the higher heating value is correct. This is particularly relevant for natural gas, whose high hydrogen content produces much water, when it is burned in condensing boilers and power plants with flue-gas condensation that condense the water vapor produced by combustion, recovering heat which would otherwise be wasted.

== Usage of terms ==
Engine manufacturers typically rate their engines fuel consumption by the lower heating values since the exhaust is never condensed in the engine, and doing this allows them to publish more attractive numbers than are used in conventional power plant terms. The conventional power industry had used HHV (high heat value) exclusively for decades, even though virtually all of these plants did not condense exhaust either. American consumers should be aware that the corresponding fuel-consumption figure based on the higher heating value will be somewhat higher.

The difference between HHV and LHV definitions causes endless confusion when quoters do not bother to state the convention being used. since there is typically a 10% difference between the two methods for a power plant burning natural gas. For simply benchmarking part of a reaction the LHV may be appropriate, but HHV should be used for overall energy efficiency calculations if only to avoid confusion, and in any case, the value or convention should be clearly stated.

== Accounting for moisture ==
Both HHV and LHV can be expressed in terms of AR (all moisture counted), MF and MAF (only water from combustion of hydrogen). AR, MF, and MAF are commonly used for indicating the heating values of coal:

* AR (as received) indicates that the fuel heating value has been measured with all moisture- and ash-forming minerals present.
* MF (moisture-free) or dry indicates that the fuel heating value has been measured after the fuel has been dried of all inherent moisture but still retaining its ash-forming minerals.
* MAF (moisture- and ash-free) or DAF (dry and ash-free) indicates that the fuel heating value has been measured in the absence of inherent moisture- and ash-forming minerals.

== Heat of combustion tables ==




; Note
* There is no difference between the lower and higher heating values for the combustion of carbon, carbon monoxide and sulfur since no water is formed during the combustion of those substances.
* BTU/lb values are calculated from MJ/kg (1 MJ/kg = 430 BTU/lb).

== Higher heating values of natural gases from various sources ==
The International Energy Agency reports the following typical higher heating values per Standard cubic metre of gas:
* Algeria: 39.57MJ/Sm3
* Bangladesh: 36.00MJ/Sm3
* Canada: 39.00MJ/Sm3
* China: 38.93MJ/Sm3
* Indonesia: 40.60MJ/Sm3
* Iran: 39.36MJ/Sm3
* Netherlands: 33.32MJ/Sm3
* Norway: 39.24MJ/Sm3
* Pakistan: 34.90MJ/Sm3
* Qatar: 41.40MJ/Sm3
* Russia: 38.23MJ/Sm3
* Saudi Arabia: 38.00MJ/Sm3
* Turkmenistan: 37.89MJ/Sm3
* United Kingdom: 39.71MJ/Sm3
* United States: 38.42MJ/Sm3
* Uzbekistan: 37.89MJ/Sm3
The lower heating value of natural gas is normally about 90% of its higher heating value. This table is in Standard cubic metres (1atm, 15°C), to convert to values per Normal cubic metre (1atm, 0°C), multiply above table by 1.0549.

<text>Husayn of Zaragoza (in the Arabic sources &quot;Al Hossain ibn Yahia al Ansari ibn Saad al Obadi&quot; and &quot;Ḥusayn ibn Yaḥyà al-Anṣārī&quot; o &quot;Al-Ḥusayn ibn Yaḥyà al-Anṣārī&quot;) was a descendant of Sa&#x27;d ibn Ubadah the companion of Muhammad, and the &quot;Wali&quot; (governor) of Zaragoza from 774 to 781.

==Events during the rule of Husayn==
*In 774 Husayn conspired with the Qahtanite aristocracy against the emir, proclaiming the rule of the Abbasid Caliphate in Hispania. In response, the emir sent general Abd al-Melek bin Umar, who obtained the allegiance of Abu Taur of Huesca and the Wali of Tudela, but who was rejected in Zaragoza.
*In 777, the Wali of Barcelona, Sulayman al-Arabi (&quot;Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al-Kalbi&quot; in the Arabic sources) offered Charlemagne his own allegiance and the allegiance of Husayn in Paderborn. But when in 778 Charlemagne arrived in Zaragoza, Husayn denied any promise. As Charlemagne could not take the city, he withdrew after a month, which then led to the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. In 780 Husayn had Sulayman al-Arabi killed after he returned to Zaragoza.
*In 781 the Emir Abd ar-Rahman I sent general Tsalaba ben Obaid to re-take Zaragoza for the Caliphate. After a long siege, Husayn agreed to a truce. His son, Said bin Husayn, was given to the Emir as a hostage.
According to the historian al-Nuwayri, Husayn was killed soon after his surrender.</text><links>

<text>Trips For Kids is a non-profit community service organization that provides beginner and intermediate-level mountain bike riding, environmental education, bicycle mechanics training and earn-a-bike programs for youth in the United States and Canada. Legally based in Marin County, California, over 230,000 children have been served by 75 Trips for Kids chapters in the United States and Canada as of December 2017.

==History==
Trips for Kids was founded in Marin County, California in 1988 by Marilyn Price, a social activist, environmentalist and Mountain Bike Hall of Fame inductee. Price used the mountain bike to teach youth lessons in personal responsibility, achievement and environmental awareness through the development of practical skills. Price formed the nonprofit Trips for Kids-Marin, the organization&#x27;s flagship program, and began national outreach in the mid-1990s to inspire new chapters. Independent chapters began to form throughout the United States, Canada, Israel and briefly in Sierra Leone, growing to 75 chapters as of August 2017.

==Programs and chapters==
In addition to the Discovery Trail Rides Program, Trips for Kids chapters also run Adventure Ride Clubs, Earn-a-Bike Workshops, Mobile Bike Clinics, camps, and other programs. Five chapters also operate recycled community bike thrift shops.

==Expansion to National Umbrella Organization==
On August 1 2017, Trips For Kids expanded into a 501c3 national umbrella organization was established to provide support for Trips for Kids chapters, build new chapters, improve program quality, and promote the organization.

==National Board of Directors ==
Patricia Gallery, President

Jason Davis, Treasurer

Chris Degenaars, Secretary

<doc id="1112289" wikidata="Q2256694" url="?curid=1112289" title="Toxicokinetics">
<text>Toxicokinetics (often abbreviated as &#x27;TK&#x27;) is the description of both what rate a chemical will enter the body and what occurs to excrete and metabolize the compound once it is in the body.

==Relation to Pharmacokinetics==
It is an application of pharmacokinetics to determine the relationship between the systemic exposure of a compound and its toxicity. It is used primarily for establishing relationships between exposures in toxicology experiments in animals and the corresponding exposures in humans. However, it can also be used in environmental risk assessments in order to determine the potential effects of releasing chemicals into the environment. In order to quantify toxic effects, toxicokinetics can be combined with toxicodynamics. Such toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models are used in ecotoxicology (see ecotoxmodels a website on mathematical models in ecotoxicology).

Similarly, physiological toxicokinetic models are physiological pharmacokinetic models developed to describe and predict the behavior of a toxicant in an animal body; for example, what parts (compartments) of the body a chemical may tend to enter (e.g. fat, liver, spleen, etc.), and whether or not the chemical is expected to be metabolized or excreted and at what rate.

==Processes==
Four potential processes exist for a chemical interacting with an animal: absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Absorption describes the entrance of the chemical into the body, and can occur through the air, water, food, or soil. Once a chemical is inside a body, it can be distributed to other areas of the body through diffusion or other biological processes. At this point, the chemical may undergo metabolism and be biotransformed into other chemicals (metabolites). These metabolites can be less or more toxic than the parent compound. After this potential biotransformation occurs, the metabolites may leave the body, be transformed into other compounds, or continue to be stored in the body compartments.

A well designed toxicokinetic study may involve several different strategies and depends on the scientific question to be answered. Controlled acute and repeated toxicokinetic animal studies are useful to identify a chemical&#x27;s biological persistence, tissue and whole body half-life, and its potential to bioaccumulate. Toxicokinetic profiles can change with increasing exposure duration or dose. Real world environmental exposures generally occur as low level mixtures, such as from air, water, food, or tobacco products. Mixture effects may differ from individual chemical toxicokinetic profiles because of chemical interactions, synergistic, or competitive processes. For other reasons, it is equally important to characterize the toxicokinetics of individual chemicals constituents found in mixtures as information on behavior or fate of the individual chemical can help explain environmental, human, and wildlife biomonitoring studies.

<text>This is a list of named geological features on [[Saturn]]&#x27;s moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Official names for these features have only been announced since the 2000s, as Titan&#x27;s surface was virtually unknown before the arrival of the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; probe. Some features were known by informal nicknames beforehand; these names are noted where appropriate. Note that some features with a physical size given by &quot;diameter&quot; may not be circular; then the number refers to the length.

==Albedo features==

Albedo features on Titan are named after sacred or enchanted places in world mythologies and literature.

===Bright albedo features===

===Dark albedo features===
==Arcūs==
Titanean arcūs (arc-shaped features) are named after deities of happiness.

==Colles==
Colles are small hills or knobs which are named after characters in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth.
==Craters==
Craters on Titan are named after deities of wisdom.

==Faculae==
Faculae (bright spots) are named after islands on Earth that are not politically independent. Groups of faculae are named after archipelagos on Earth.

==Fluctūs==
The term &quot;fluctus&quot; refers to flow terrain. Fluctūs on Titan are named after mythological figures associated with beauty.

==Flumina==
A flumen is a feature that looks like a channel carved by liquid. Flumina refers to a network of rivers. Some flumina are not found near liquid bodies, which are labelled as &quot;dry valley&quot;. They are named after mythical or imaginary rivers.

==Freta==
A fretum (plural &quot;freta&quot;) is a strait of liquid connecting two larger liquid bodies. They are named after characters from the Foundation series of science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov.
==Insulae==
Insulae are islands within Titan&#x27;s seas. They are named after legendary islands.

==Labyrinthi==
Labyrinthi (complexes of intersecting valleys or ridges) on Titan are named after planets from the fictional &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert.

==Lacunae==

Lacunae are dark areas with the appearance of dry lake beds, which are named after intermittent lakes on Earth.

==Lacūs==

Lacūs (plural form of used in Titan geological nomenclature) are hydrocarbon lakes.

==Large ringed features==
Large ring features are named after deities of wisdom in world mythology.

==Maculae==

Titanean maculae (dark spots) are named after deities of happiness, peace, and harmony in world mythology.

==Maria==

Maria (plural of mare) are hydrocarbon seas.

==Montes==
Mountains are named after mountains from the fictional Middle-Earth created by J.R.R. Tolkien.

==Paterae==
Paterae are caldera or deep-wall craters with a possible volcanic origin. Sotra Patera was formerly named Sotra Facula, which followed the naming theme for Faculae. No nomenclature currently exists for this class of features on Titan.
==Planitiae==
Planitiae (low plains) on Titan are named after planets from the fictional &quot;Dune&quot; universe created by Frank Herbert.

==Regiones==

Regiones (regions distinctly different from their surroundings) are named after deities of peace and happiness.

==Sinūs==
Sinus (bays) within seas or lakes are named after terrestrial bays, coves, fjords or inlets.
==Terrae==
Terrae are extensive landmasses. As with the albedo features, they are named after sacred and enchanted locations from cultures across the world.

==Undae==
Undae are dune fields. On Titan they are named after Greek deities of wind.

==Virgae==

Virgae (streaks of colour) are named after rain gods in world mythologies.

==Informal names for previously unnamed features==

Because the exact nature of many surface features remain mysterious, a number of features took time to receive formal names and are known by nicknames. In most cases, indications of brightness and darkness refer not to visible light, but to the infrared images used to look through Titan&#x27;s obscuring haze.

*&#x27;The Sickle&#x27;: a large, dark, sickle-shaped region identified by the Hubble Space Telescope.
*&#x27;Throat of Kraken&#x27;: unofficial name for the strait that separates the north and south basins of Kraken Mare, before officially being named Seldon Fretum. It was used in early publications that hypothesized about its role with tidal dissipation and surface currents between the two basins of Kraken Mare.

<doc id="1112303" wikidata="Q2020670" url="?curid=1112303" title="Khums">
<text>In Islam, khums ( ) is a tax on Muslims which obligates them to pay one-fifth (20%) of their acquired wealth from the spoils of war and, according to most Muslim jurists, other specified types of income, towards various designated beneficiaries. In Islamic legal terminology, &quot;spoils of war&quot; (&quot;al-ghanima&quot;) refers to property and wealth looted by the Muslim army after battling with non-Muslims or raiding them. Khums is the first Islamic tax, which was imposed in 2 AH/624 CE, after the Battle of Badr. It is separate from other Islamic taxes such as zakat and jizya. It is treated differently in Sunni and Shia Islam; key topics of debate include the types of wealth subject to khums, the methods of its collection and distribution, and the categories of recipients (&quot;asnāf&quot;).

Historically, one-fifth of the spoils of war (i.e., the khums) was placed at the disposal of the Islamic prophet Muhammad who distributed it among himself, his close relatives, orphans, the needy and travelers (the remaining four-fifth of the spoils went to soldiers of the Muslim army who attacked the non-Muslims). After Muhammad&#x27;s death, disagreement arose about how to use the share once given to Muhammad and whether to continue to give his close relatives a share of the khums. Over time, Sunni Muslims came to believe that khums should be paid to the ruler of the Islamic state for the general good of the Muslims, maintaining the Muslim army, and for distribution between the orphans, the needy, travelers, and, according to some jurists, the descendants of Muhammad. For the Shia, the khums must be paid to the Imam of the time, as the rightful heir of Muhammad, who then distributes it among the orphans, the needy, the travelers and other descendants of Muhammad. As Twelver Shi&#x27;is believe the Imam of the time is currently in Occultation (&quot;ghayba&quot;), they pay khums to senior religious scholars (&quot;mujtahids&quot;) of their choice, who are considered representatives of this Hidden Imam, and these jurists then divide the khums into two portions: one for distribution among the indigent descendants of Muhammad and the other for any activities that they believe will be agreeable to the Hidden Imam.

In Sunni Islam, jurists are unanimous in applying the khums to spoils of war but disagreement exists on whether this tax extends (at the rate of 20%) to buried treasure and products extracted from mines and the sea. In Shia Islam, khums is to be paid on the spoils of war, found treasure (&quot;al-kanz&quot;), mineral resources (&quot;al-maʼdin&quot;), objects obtained from the sea (&quot;al-ghawṣ&quot;), the profits of any income (&quot;arbāḥ al-mākasib&quot;), the lawful wealth (&quot;al-ḥalāl&quot;) which has become mixed with unlawful wealth (&quot;al-ḥarām&quot;), and the sale of land to a &quot;dhimmi&quot;.

==Origin==
The Arabic term &quot;khums&quot; literally means &quot;one-fifth.&quot; The institution of khums has its origins in pre-Islamic Arab custom, where the chief received one-fourth (&quot;mirbā&quot;&#x27;) or one-fifth of the war booty along with the &quot;ṣafw al-māl &quot; (any part of the booty that particularly attracted him). The remaining booty was typically shared among the raiders who accompanied the chief, but the chief retained the right to dispose of the booty as he saw fit. Under Islam, the management and distribution of war booty became a state responsibility due to the large amounts of booty involved. The straightforward pre-Islamic Arab practice of division was inadequate for the more complex circumstances resulting from the Muslim conquests.

Muslim scholars agree that the khums was introduced in Islam when Quran 8:41 (called &quot;āyat al-khums&quot; or &quot;āyat al-ghanīma&quot;) was revealed:
Regarding the circumstances of its revelation, there is disagreement between exegetes. One account mentions that Abd Allah b. Jahsh independently designated one-fifth of the spoils taken from raiding the Quraysh at Nakhla — the first spoils obtained under Islam — for Muhammad shortly before the Battle of Badr (2 AH/624 CE), and this practice was later confirmed by the Quran. Other sources suggest that khums was introduced at various times, including during Badr itself, after the victories over Banu al-Nadir (4/625) or Banu Qurayza (5/627), during the conquest of Khaybar (7/628), or even as late as the Battle of Hunayn (8/630). However, it is generally believed that Quran 8:41 abrogated Quran 8:1 (called &quot;āyat al-anfāl&quot;, which had allowed Muhammad to distribute the spoils from the Battle of Badr as he deemed appropriate). Thus, Quran 8:41 is thought to have been revealed sometime after Badr, with some sources indicating that the rule of khums was first applied to the booty acquired from the victory over the Jewish tribe of Banu Qaynuqa (2/624). Hence khums is considered the first Islamic tax, imposed after the Battle of Badr, two years after the Hijra.

==During Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime==
Muhammad taught paying khums as a fundamental religious duty. Two people who collected khums for Muhammad are identified as Mahmiya b. Jaz&#x27; and Abd Allah b. Ka&#x27;b al-Ansari. Ali b. Abi Talib was appointed by Muhammad to distribute the portion of khums allocated to his near relatives.

Muhammad received one-fifth of the booty allocated to him in God&#x27;s name, alongside two additional categories of shares from the booty: the &quot;ṣafw al-māl&quot; (the select item that Muhammad chose for himself before the booty was distributed) and his share as a participant in the battle alongside other warriors. The remaining four-fifths of the booty was to be distributed among the troops who accompanied the Prophet.

==After Muhammad&#x27;s death==
Shortly after the death of Muhammad in 11 AH/632 CE, the allocation of khums to the various groups mentioned in Quran 8:41 became a source of disagreement. The main issue revolved around how to treat the first three groups specified in the verse—God, the Prophet, and his family—with particular contention regarding the latter two. Muhammad&#x27;s successor and the first caliph Abu Bakr (r. 632–34) reportedly sought the opinions of the Muslims regarding the shares belonging to Muhammad and his family, receiving a variety of perspectives on the matter. Some advised him to redistribute these shares among the other recipients, while others argued that they should be allocated for preparations for war, such as acquiring horses and weapons. Abu Bakr removed the entitlement of Muhammad&#x27;s family to the khums and allocated it to the clans of the Quraysh, thereby strengthening their support for his caliphate. Umar (r. 634–44) proposed using the khums to cover marriage expenses and debts for the unmarried members of the Muhammad&#x27;s family. When Muhammad&#x27;s closest relatives demanded their entire share, Umar refused their request.

During the caliphates of Uthman (r. 644–56) and Ali (r. 656–61), the practice of dividing the khums into three parts—one for orphans, one for the poor, and one for travelers—became well-established. As a relative of Muhammad, Ali was inquired about the family&#x27;s share and noted that while they had been compensated until the conquests of Susa and Ahwaz, their share was discontinued thereafter.

Another account states that Ali once asked Muhammad to establish a law ensuring the continuation of his family&#x27;s share after his death, which was enacted. This arrangement reportedly lasted until the final days of Umar, who ended the allocation of the share to the Prophet&#x27;s family when revenues increased. There were subsequent concerns about Ali potentially making a similar decision.

==Sunni jurisprudence==
Sunni exegetes interpret Quran 8:41 as specifically referring to war booty; however, there is considerable disagreement among them regarding the circumstances of its revelation, its interpretation, and how applicable it is after Muhammad&#x27;s death.

===Applicability===
Jurists of the four Sunni schools of law—Hanafi, Hanbali, Maliki and Shafi&#x27;i—have differing views about the things khums is applicable on. In its original form, khums was applied at the rate of 20% to spoils of war. Over time, this tax was expanded to include treasure, mines, and all materials extracted from the sea or earth. Today, Sunni jurisprudence holds that khums is applicable only to excavated items from land, sea, mines, buried treasures, and spoils of war, at the rate of 20%. In this context, khums functions both as a “windfall tax” and as a tax on specific natural resources.

====Spoils of war &quot;or&quot; booty (&quot;ghanima&quot;)====
Jurists of all schools agree about the rules governing khums applying to &quot;ghanima&quot;, which is interpreted as the spoils of war or booty acquired through armed conflict. However, the Shafi&#x27;is and some Hanbalis, particularly al-Khiraqi (d. 334/945), extend the application of khums to &quot;fayʾ&quot;, which is property given up by non-Muslims without resort to war, for example, as a result of negotiations or a treaty. The Malikis identify an intermediate category, &quot;al-mukhtaṣṣ&quot;, which includes property looted stealthily from the non-Muslim territory, and stipulate that the khums from this property must be privately distributed by the individual who seized it. There is ongoing debate regarding the obligation of khums on property taken by small groups of raiders acting independently.

Food consumed by combatants or their animals does not count as booty subject to division. During Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, items he selected as personal prizes (&quot;ṣafī&quot;) were also not counted as booty subject to division. Khums is calculated on the total booty after deducting expenses like transport and safekeeping. According to the Hanbalis and Shafi&#x27;is, deductions also include the clothing, weapons, mounts, and other personal items (&quot;salab&quot;) of opponent soldiers claimed by the specific Muslim soldiers who have killed or disabled them. The Hanafis and Malikis treat claims to these personal items as &quot;rewards&quot; (&quot;anfāl&quot;; sing. &quot;nafal&quot;), requiring an express grant from the ruler. The Hanafis provide rewards from the khums if the grant is made after the booty is secured in Islamic territory (&quot;iḥrāz&quot;); otherwise, it comes from the four-fifths of the booty. The Hanbalis also draw rewards from the four-fifths. The Malikis provide rewards from khums in all cases and the Shafi&#x27;is provide rewards from the one-fourth share of the khums designated for community needs.

The rules for khums apply first and foremost to movable property: prisoners of war (including combatants, women and children) are enslaved and included in the booty to be divided. The captured slaves of the non-Muslims are also included in the booty to be divided. There is disagreement regarding real property: the Shafi&#x27;is divide it among the Muslim combatants and subject it to khums, while the Malikis do not. The Hanafis and Hanbalis leave the division to the ruler&#x27;s discretion. When dividing the booty itself, rather than its sale price, the determination of khums is made by lot, with specific designations for khums (i.e., &quot;li&#x27;llāh&quot;, &quot;li&#x27;l-maṣāliḥ&quot;, &quot;li-rasūl Allāh&quot;).

There is debate regarding how much a ruler can bypass the general rules for dividing booty, including khums, by stating that each combatant may keep what they take as a reward. Many Hanafis argue that booty obtained under such a general offer of reward (&quot;tanfīl ʻāmm&quot;) is not subject to khums provided it is obtained by a detachment (sariyya), rather than the whole army, that is sent from within enemy territory.

====Treasure====
The Hanafis, Hanbalis and Malikis view the one-fifth due on the discovery of pre-Islamic treasure, as enjoined by hadith, as analogous to the one-fifth from booty (khums). The Shafi&#x27;is limit this obligation to gold and silver, applying the same minimum amount (&quot;niṣāb&quot;) as zakat on those metals. While the Hanafis distribute this one-fifth similarly to the khums from booty, the Hanbalis and Malikis classify it as &quot;fayʾ&quot; to be used for community needs, whereas the Shafi&#x27;is treat it as zakat.

====Mining products (&quot;maʻdin&quot;)====
The Hanafis and some Malikis also extend the one-fifth rule to mining products, such as malleable metals according to the Hanafis and nearly pure pieces gold and silver (&quot;nadra&quot;) according to the Malikis.

====Sea products====
Opinions from some early scholars suggested that a one-fifth share was also due on pearls, ambergris, and other sea products, including fish, but these views were not widely followed.

===Division and distribution===
The common Sunni view is that during Muhammad&#x27;s lifetime, khums was divided into five shares, with Muhammad receiving a share allocated &quot;for God and the Prophet&quot; (referred to as &quot;khums al-khums&quot;). This share was used by Muhammad to support himself and his immediate family and the other shares were directed toward his kin and community needs. A minority, including the Basran Quran scholar Abu al-&#x27;Aliya Rufay b. Mihran al-Riyahi (d. 90/708 or 96/714) and, as reported occasionally, his mentor Ibn Abbas (d. 68/687-8), argued that a separate sixth share designated for God existed which was meant for the maintenance of the Kaaba. Muqatil b. Sulayman (d. 150/767) stated that khums was divided into four parts, with one part representing the shares of God, Muhammad, and Muhammad&#x27;s family.

The Shafi&#x27;is and Hanbalis continue to divide khums into five shares following Muhammad&#x27;s death: (1) the share of God and the Prophet (previously given to Muhammad), which now supports the needs of the Muslim community (&quot;sahm al-maṣālih&quot;), (2) the share for the Prophet&#x27;s relatives (&quot;dhu&#x27;l-qurba&quot;), given to the members of the Banu Hashim (Muhammad&#x27;s clan) and the Banu Muttalib clans regardless of their needs, with males receiving twice the share of females, (3) orphans (&quot;yatāmā&quot;), defined as needy minors without a father, (4) the poor (&quot;masākīn&quot;), corresponding to the &quot;poor and needy&quot; in Quran 9:60, and (5) travelers, defined similarly as for zakat. Al-Shafi&#x27;i (d. 204/820; the eponymous founder of the Shafi&#x27;i school of Sunni Islam) was from the Banu Hashim and extensively argued for the share of the nearest relatives, contending that it should be granted because the &quot;ghanima&quot; had increased—referring to Umar&#x27;s denial of this share. He maintained that no Muslim has the right to deny the portion designated for them by Qur&#x27;anic command.

The Hanafi stance is that after Muhammad&#x27;s death, his share and that of his family ceased to exist. Hanafis support this stance with the practice of the first four caliphs (Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali) as evidence. They teach that khums should be divided only among only three of the five categories mentioned in Surah 8:41, namely the orphans, the needy, and travelers. However, they do give priority to needy members of Muhammad&#x27;s family within these three categories, as his family members are religiously forbidden to receive alms like zakat.
The Hanafi stance is likely a later developed view as Abu Yusuf (d. 182/798) reported that Hanafi jurists of his time believed khums should be divided into three shares: one for Muhammad (to be passed to the caliph after his death), another for Muhammad&#x27;s family, and a third for orphans, the poor, and wayfarers. Abu Yusuf, a disciple of Abu Hanifa (d. 150/768), the founder of the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, attributed to him the view that the shares of Muhammad and his family should be used for amassing troops and weapons instead, in line with the practices of the first two caliphs (Abu Bakr and Umar) who succeeded Muhammad. However, another disciple of Abu Hanifa, al-Shaybani (d. 189/802), attributed to him the view that khums should be divided into three parts: one for the poor, one for orphans, and one for travelers. al-Baydawi (d. 1316) reported that Abu Hanifa held that the shares for the Prophet and his family ceased to exist after his death. These varying opinions among jurists within a single school reveal the confusion in the sources used to determine the distribution of khums and also the complexities arising from the extensive expansion of the Islamic empire.

The Malikis view the categories mentioned in Quran 8:41 as illustrative and consider the entire khums as &quot;fayʾ&quot;, to be allocated for the needs of Muslims at the discretion of the ruler, a position also supported by the Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyya (d. 652/1254). For instance, the ruler could choose to divide it evenly between the poor and the rich. Additionally, Malik (d. 179/795), founder of the Maliki school of Sunni Islam, asserted that the ruler could, if he wished, allocate part of the khums to Muhammad&#x27;s family. The Malikis also recommend that the distribution of khums should start with grants to members of the Banu Hashim.

Special allocations (&quot;raḍkh&quot;) of booty for slaves, women, and children participating in battle, who do not qualify as combatants, are distributed differently: according to the Hanafis from the total booty, according to the Shafi&#x27;is and Hanbalis from the four-fifths left after taking out the khums, and according to the Malikis from khums itself, although they generally disapprove of such allocations.

Most later Muslim jurists agreed that the portion of the khums designated for Muhammad should be spent, among other things, to maintain the Muslim army and for the general good of the Muslims. These jurists also concurred that a portion of the khums should go to the &quot;near relatives&quot; of Muhammad, but they disagreed on who these rightful near relatives were, with some considering them to be the Banu Hashim only, and others including the Banu Muttalib with them.

==Twelver Shia jurisprudence==
Paying khums is of great importance in Twelver Shi&#x27;ism. and is one of the practices that are considered the obligatory acts of faith (&quot;furūʻ al-dīn&quot;). The discussion of khums is a vital component of all Twelver works of jurisprudence and constitutes one of the basic differences between the Twelver school and other Islamic legal schools.
Historically, the fifth Imam Muhammad al-Baqir (d. 114/732) refused to accept religious funds. In contrast, the sixth Imam Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq (d. 148/765) occasionally accepted zakat, voluntary donations (&quot;nadhr&quot;), endowments (&quot;waqf&quot;), and gifts from his followers. However, both Imams Muhammad al-Baqir and Ja&#x27;far al-Sadiq did not impose khums on their followers. There was a widespread belief in their time that this tax would be established by the Qa&#x27;im when he came to implement his rule of justice in the future.

There are some reports that the seventh Imam Musa al-Kadhim (d. 183/799-800) received khums from his followers and that the eighth Imam Ali al-Rida (d. 203/818) instructed his followers to pay this tax. The systematic collection of khums as a mandatory tax seems to have started in 220/835 when the ninth Imam Muhammad al-Jawad (d. 220/835), through a document, directed his financial representatives to collect khums on specific types of income. The document from Muhammad al-Jawad attests to the fact that the tax was not systematically collected before the date mentioned. Historical accounts indicate that the practice of collecting this tax through local representatives of the Imam became well-established during the latter part of the tenure of the tenth Imam Ali al-Hadi (d. 254/868). The revenues of the office of the Imamate increased significantly with the introduction of the khums tax, which the Imam&#x27;s agents collected from the faithful as his right. Since this tax was still a new imposition, questions arose regarding the extent of this &quot;right.&quot; Three key representatives of Ali al-Hadi informed him that they had encountered questions from the Shia community about the right of the Imam that they were unable to answer.

The revenue from khums appears to have been a significant source of income for the Imams, who, according to Islamic law, were not permitted to receive alms (&quot;sadaqāt&quot;; sing. &quot;sadaqa&quot;). This income also highlighted their strength and that of their followers. In some instances, the Imams&#x27; wealth became a source of envy for the caliphs, who noted the &quot;flow of wealth from east and west&quot; to the Imams. For instance, the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (d. 193/809) learned about the khums received by the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim, in Medina. According to Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, this was one of the reasons that led to the imprisonment of this Imam by the caliph.

===Applicability===
For the Shia, the main Quranic reference for khums is verse 8:41 of the Quran. While Sunni exegetes consider Quran 8:41 to relate to war booty (&quot;ghanīma&quot;), Twelver and Zaydi scholars consider the phrase &quot;whatever of a thing you acquire&quot; (&quot;annamā ghanimtum min shayʼin&quot;) in the verse to refer to wealth more generally. In the Twelver tradition, various &quot;akhbār&quot; (reports or sayings of the Imams) substantiate the definition of &quot;ghanima&quot; this way, such as the saying of the eighth Imam Ali al-Rida: &quot;Everything from which the people gain benefit is &quot;ghanima&quot;.&quot; Additionally, several &quot;akhbar&quot; assert the Imam&#x27;s original ownership of the world and its resources, exemplified by the claim, &quot;All the earth is ours, and what God produces from it is also ours.&quot; Consequently, khums is viewed as analogous to a tenant&#x27;s obligation to pay a fixed percentage of the harvest to the landowner.

As early as the fourth century AH/tenth century CE, Muhammad b. Ya’qub al-Kulayni (d. 328/940-41) compiled the main traditions regarding what belongs to the Imam, laying the groundwork for the subsequent development of khums within Twelver Shi’ism. In his &quot;Kitab al-Kafi&quot;, al-Kulayni offered a summary of the earliest understanding of khums in Twelver teachings. Although Twelver jurists (&quot;fuqahā&quot;ʾ) have varied in their interpretations of al-Kulayni&#x27;s summary over time, his explanation is generally regarded as the foundational understanding of the concept of khums:
According to this understanding, everything on earth is the exclusive property of the Imam, and only the believers, specifically the Shia, are allowed to use this property. They are entitled to four-fifths of the usufruct for their labor, while the remaining one-fifth belongs to the Imam. The &quot;anfal&quot; encompasses anything obtained without conflict, such as crown lands (&quot;qata&#x27;i al-muluk&quot;), &quot;sawafi&quot; (lands allocated to rulers), abandoned lands, and heritable land with no heirs, including woods, forests, and mines, as well as all that is found in the seas and on the ocean floor. The Shia could occupy the Imam&#x27;s property only with his permission; all others were deemed usurpers who had unlawfully taken the anfal and would be expelled by the Qa&#x27;im, the Mahdi of the Twelvers, upon his return.

In another tradition referenced by al-Kulayni, a Shi’i from al-Bahrayn named Misma’ Abu Sayyar presented the Imam with 80,000 dirhams, indicating that this amount was one-fifth of his earnings from diving for pearls in al-Bahrayn, done in accordance with God&#x27;s command regarding the Imam&#x27;s rights. The Imam responded, &quot;Is it only one-fifth of what God brings forth from the earth that belongs to us? O Abu Sayyar, all the earth is ours, and everything God produces from it belongs to us.&quot; Misma’ then offered to bring the entire amount, to which the Imam replied, &quot;O Abu Sayyar, we have purified it for you and made it lawful; take it and add it to your possessions. All that the earth holds in the hands of our Shia is lawful for them until the Qa&#x27;im appears, who will collect what is due from them while leaving the earth in their possession. However, for those who are not followers of the Imams, what they acquire from the earth is unlawful until our Qa&#x27;im returns, at which point he will reclaim the earth from them and expel them empty-handed.&quot;

Twelver jurists assert that the term &quot;ghanima&quot; encompasses a broader definition than just the booty from battles with non-Muslims and that it also includes various forms of gains and profits generated through trade and business. This distinction is a fundamental difference between the Twelver school and other schools of fiqh. Given that verse 8:41 appears within a discourse on war, exegetical efforts were made to reinforce the interpretation that khums applied on any income, not just spoils of war. Such efforts typically began with a grammatical analysis of the term &quot;ghanima&quot; and the related verb, as discussed by al-Shaykh al-Tusi (d. 460/1067), where the verb is defined as &quot;acquiring something for profitable use.&quot; al-Tusi (d. 1067), in his discussion of &quot;ghanima&quot;, explained that the term is derived from the root &quot;gh-n-m&quot;, which refers to anything acquired with the intention of making a profit, whether through capital or not. Hence, according to the jurists, &quot;al-ghanima&quot; refers to anything that becomes profitable without requiring capital. Based on this understanding, &quot;ghanima&quot; can be categorized into two types: first, what is taken from &quot;dār al-ḥarb&quot; (abode of war) through fighting, subjugation, or victory; and second, what is obtained by other means, such as treasures, mines, or diving for pearls, as well as surplus income. Regarding spoils of war taken from &quot;dar al-harb&quot;, a one-fifth share must be extracted from it, regardless of whether it can be transferred to Islamic territory. The interpretation that khums applied on more than just spoils of war was further supported by additional &quot;akhbār&quot; (sayings of the Imams; sing. &quot;khabar&quot;) such as: &quot;A fifth of the earth is ours, and a fifth of all things is ours.&quot;

The items subject to khums have been specified in various collections of &quot;akhbar&quot; as well as in works of jurisprudence. The earliest classification of taxable wealth included six categories: spoils of war, products from the sea, buried treasure, minerals, and &quot;malāhā&quot;. The term &quot;malāhā&quot; was interpreted through juristic reasoning and references to other &quot;akhbar&quot;, as profits from trade, agriculture, and crafts, as well as from land owned by a dhimmi (i.e., a free non-Muslim in Islamic territory) that is acquired by a Muslim and &quot;halal wealth mixed with haram wealth.&quot; This led to a total of seven categories. Once these categories were established, they remained notably consistent in later traditions. al-Tusi&#x27;s &quot;al-Mabsut&quot; and &quot;al-Tahdhib&quot;, along with his &quot;al-Nihaya&quot;, encapsulate the Twelver stance on this matter. Later Twelver works on jurisprudence contribute very little beyond what earlier authorities like al-Tusi provided regarding khums, although some of them do introduce new interpretations on certain key issues related to its distribution.

====Contemporary view on applicability====
Khums is calculated on the following seven items after deducting one year&#x27;s provisions:
#Booty seized during a raid or the spoils of war (&quot;al-ghanīma&quot;)
#The profit of income, regardless of the trade or business it is from (&quot;arbāḥ al-mākasib&quot;)
#The legitimately earned wealth (&quot;al-ḥalāl&quot;) which has become mixed with illegitimate wealth (&quot;al-ḥarām&quot;). Wealth is considered “mixed” when the owner is unable to distinguish the amount or items which he has acquired by lawful means from those which have come to his possession by “unlawful” means (i.e., any means not permitted in Islamic law, such as gambling, usury, the liquor business, etc.)
#Mines and mineral resources extracted (&quot;al-maʻadan&quot;)
#Objects obtained from the sea (&quot;al-ghawṣ&quot;)
#Treasure found (&quot;al-kanz&quot;)
#The land sold by a Muslim to a &quot;dhimmi&quot; (a free non-Muslim who is subject to a treaty of surrender in the Islamic state).
Khums is a 20% tax on the aforementioned wealth, after deductions for expenses of the individual and dependents. It becomes obligatory (&quot;wajib&quot;) to pay khums at the beginning of the new financial year on the profit or surplus of the past year&#x27;s income. The &quot;beginning&quot; of the new financial year means the time when the profit or surplus of the income of the past year becomes clear. According to most contemporary jurists, it is precautionarily obligatory to pay khums on any prizes, gifts, bequests (items received through the will of a friend or someone unrelated), alms, zakat, and khums received. However, khums is not required on dowry or inheritance, except in cases where one inherits from an unlikely source, such as a distant relative from whom inheritance is not anticipated.

The Shi’i conception of khums has been described as an in-kind tax or a type of income tax. It can be paid either in kind or as an equivalent amount of money, which must reflect the fair market value of the taxable item. Unlike zakat, which applies as long as the holdings exceed the required nisab, khums is a one-time tax - once khums is paid on an item, that item is permanently exempt from any future khums.

===Division and distribution===
When the Imam is present, he is responsible for receiving and distributing khums, although he may appoint a representative for this task. In the Twelver legal system, khums was divided into six portions: one each for God, Muhammad, Muhammad&#x27;s family, orphans, the needy, and travelers. The Twelvers argue that the division of khums into six portions aligns with the direct interpretation of Quran 8:41.

Al-Shaykh al-Tusi explained that according to one view, God&#x27;s share was allocated to Muhammad, who could use it in the service of God. After Muhammad&#x27;s death, his share is given to his closest relatives, in addition to the specific portion designated for his family. The share for orphans was assigned to the orphans of the Muhammad&#x27;s family (i.e., Banu Hashim), while the remaining two shares were distributed to the poor and travellers as alms (&quot;sadaqa&quot;), thereby excluding the Muhammad&#x27;s family from these portions. However, this view was not widely accepted.

According to another view noted by al-Tusi, the portions designated for God and Muhammad are considered the property of the Imam. The share for Muhammad&#x27;s family also goes to the Imam, who is responsible for distributing it among the family members. The remaining three shares are allocated to the orphans, the needy, and travelers in the general population, not just the Banu Hashim. Ibn Hamza (who lived in 566/1170) supported this position.

However, according to the majority of Twelver jurists as noted by al-Tusi, the shares allocated for God and Muhammad are designated for Muhammad&#x27;s successor, his wali al-amr (the executor of his will). Therefore, the Imam receives three shares: two as the rightful heir of Muhammad and one assigned to him by God. The other three shares are distributed to orphans, the poor, and travellers from the Banu Hashim only. A minority also contended that the descendants of Hashim&#x27;s brother, Muttalib, should be included among Muhammad&#x27;s family, similar to how the descendants of both Hasan and Husayn hold sayyid status. However, this view did not gain significant influence. al-Kulayni narrated a tradition from Sulaym b. Qays al-Hilali, who heard Ali state that the “family of the Prophet” (&quot;dhawi al-qurba&quot;) mentioned in Quran 8:41 refers specifically to the Banu Hashim, and that &quot;the orphans and the needy&quot; are exclusively among them, as they cannot have a share in alms (&quot;sadaqa&quot;) in Islam. The juristic reasoning for the majority position, later summarized by Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi (d. 1266/1850), is as follows: God&#x27;s share was initially owned by Muhammad, who had the authority to manage it as he wished. After Muhammad&#x27;s death, both shares (of God and Muhammad) were inherited by the Imam. The share for &quot;near relatives&quot; also goes to the Imam, as they became the heads of the Ahl al-Bayt following Muhammad&#x27;s death. Thus, when the Imam is present, he is entitled to half of the khums, with the remaining shares distributed by him. As the shares intended for Muhammad&#x27;s family must be managed by the Imam for the benefit of his descendants and the remaining three portions of khums should also be exclusively for the Banu Hashim, meaning they must also be administered by the Imam. This necessitates the continuous presence of the Imam to oversee the administration of khums. In the absence of the Imam, as is the case with the Twelfth Imam during the period of Occultation (&quot;ghayba&quot;) that began in 260/874, questions arose regarding the management of khums and whether it is still obligatory during this time. This leads to the question of who is empowered to lead the Twelvers until the return of the Twelfth Imam, a contentious issue of Twelver authority during the period of the Occultation.

====Khums during the Occultation====
The Imam&#x27;s absence during the Occultation (260/874-present) allowed Twelver jurists to link the topic of khums payment to the contentious matter of community leadership during the absence of the Twelfth Imam. Twelver jurists held differing views regarding the handling of khums. al-Tusi (d. 460/1067), the most prominent Shi’i legal scholar of the early Middle Ages, summarizes these opinions in his book &quot;al-Mabsut&quot;. According to al-Tusi, Twelver jurists had four distinct opinions regarding what to do with khums, particularly concerning the three shares of the Imam, during the Occultation. al-Tusi added that there is no specific stipulation (&quot;naṣṣ mu&#x27;ayyan&quot;) in the sources regarding this matter:
# The first opinion holds that during the Occultation, khums is permissible for the Shia under certain conditions, and they are not required to pay it until the Imam reappears. Consequently, the Shia may freely use the Imam&#x27;s property, as it has been made lawful for them. In other words, khums was considered lapsed (sāqiṭ) because the Imam could not collect it personally, a perspective associated with Salar al-Daylami (d. 463/1071). However, al-Tusi disagreed with this view, arguing that it contradicts the principle of precaution, which dictates that individuals should not act without restrictions when it comes to disposing of others&#x27; property.
# The second opinion asserts that one must retain the khums for their entire life, and as death approaches, they should make a will (wasiyya) to a trusted fellow believer to ensure it is handed over to the Imam upon his reappearance. If this individual dies before seeing the Imam, they should similarly bequeath it to another reliable person until the goods can reach the Imam. al-Tusi did not object to this view. Some jurists, such as Ibn Idris al-Hilli (d. 598/1202), argued that the will option applied only to the Imam&#x27;s share (i.e., one half of the khums), while the remaining three shares could be distributed by individuals themselves. Ibn Idris maintained that the Imam&#x27;s share should be preserved until his return, although this idea was not further developed.
# The third view holds that khums should be buried, as the earth will yield its treasures when the Mahdi returns. This practice was linked to Ibn Barraj al-Tarabulusi (d. 481/1099). al-Tusi did not oppose this method.
# The fourth view related by al-Tusi states that khums should be divided into six portions. The three shares designated for the Imam should either be buried or entrusted to a reliable person. The remaining three portions should be distributed among the Banu Hashim, specifically their orphans, the poor, and wayfarers. Proponents of this opinion argue that this is the appropriate course of action because the eligible recipients are present, and since the Imam, who would normally oversee the distribution, is not currently visible, it is treated similarly to zakat and thus lawful to distribute. al-Tusi appeared to support this arrangement, as he does not raise any objections to it.

Muhsin al-Hakim (d. 1390/1970) discussed additional opinions beyond those previously mentioned, reflecting the legal rulings of both &quot;ancient&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; Imami jurists. Many of these rulings present alternative combinations of the four opinions outlined by al-Tusi. Some of these views can be considered &quot;radical&quot; and have not garnered support among the mujtahids, although they are appealing to the Shia masses. For example, Ibn Hamza Muhammad b. Ali al-Tusi (d. sixth/twelfth century), the author of an early work on Imami fiqh titled &quot;al-Wasila fi al-fiqh&quot;, argued that khums should be allocated to all needy Shia, irrespective of whether they are sayyids, based on numerous authentic traditions from the Imams asserting that the needs of all impoverished individuals fall under their responsibility. al-Hakim responded that Ibn Hamza&#x27;s stance is only valid when the Imam is present, as he alone has the authority to make such decisions regarding the inclusion of all Shia in the typically restricted distribution of khums.

Muhaqqiq al-Hilli (d. 676/1277) stated that the Imam had granted the Shia permission (&quot;idhn&quot;) to utilize his property generally, including khums, during his absence, which did not constitute unauthorized use. He asserted that khums should be distributed by &quot;the one who possesses authority through delegation&quot; (&quot;niyāba&quot;). al-Mutahhar al-Hilli (d. 726/1325) identified this authority as belonging to &quot;al-hākim&quot;, referring to a member of the jurists. Over time, these terminological distinctions became more refined, reaching a conclusion with the Safavid jurist Muhammad Baqir al-Sabziwari (d. 1090/1679), who argued that khums should be given to &quot;worthy recipients through the auspices of the just jurist qualified to issue fatwas,&quot; meaning that mujtahids should receive and distribute khums. This position remains prevalent today.

al-Hakim&#x27;s perspective on khums in the absence of the Imam was that even though the Imam is in occultation, it is possible to discern how he would want khums to be administered. Therefore, al-Hakim maintained that a qualified mujtahid in religious sciences could serve as the Imam&#x27;s representative (&quot;wakīl&quot;, &quot;nā&#x27;ib&quot;) and collect khums on his behalf. This representative must be the most knowledgeable (&quot;al-a&#x27;lam&quot;) and righteous (&quot;al-&#x27;adil&quot;) jurist, ensuring that khums is used appropriately according to the Imam&#x27;s wishes during the occultation. Once the mujtahid receives the khums, he is to divide it into two parts: sahm al-Imam and sahm al-sadat. The first portion, which includes the shares for God, the Prophet, and the Imam, should be used for promoting the faith and similar activities. al-Hakim argued that the administration of sahm al-Imam rightly belongs to someone well-versed in matters of the faith, making the mujtahid responsible for fulfilling the Imam&#x27;s intentions. The second portion, sahm al-sadat, is to be distributed exclusively among the Banu Hashim. al-Hakim&#x27;s suggestion reflects practices from the early days of Twelver history during the Minor Occultation of the Twelfth Imam (873–941), when the Imam&#x27;s representatives collected khums in his absence. This practice evolved into a well-organized institution, particularly from the late Safavid period onward. al-Hakim&#x27;s opinion is now the standard view among contemporary Twelver mujtahids, who continue to adhere to this division of khums. Clearly, the revenue from khums remains a significant source of power and prestige for the mujtahids as indirect representatives of the Hidden Imam.

====Contemporary view on division and distribution====
The Shi’i clergy take the six categories of potential recipients mentioned in the Quran 8:41 literally, declaring that each of them is entitled to one-sixth of the khums:
# Allah
# Muhammad
# the near relatives of Muhammad
# orphans
# the needy
# stranded travelers.

Shi’is believe that since Allah does not personally collect his share of khums, Muhammad, as Allah&#x27;s representative on earth, received both his own share and that of Allah. After his death, the shares of Allah and the Prophet are entrusted to his rightful successor, the Imam of the time. Thus the first three categories— Allah, Muhammad and his near relatives—are combined and, accordingly, three-sixths of the khums are due the Twelfth Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi. This portion is referred to as the “Imam’s share” (Arabic: &quot;sahm al-Imām&quot;; Persian: &quot;sahm-e Imām&quot;). The remaining three categories—orphans, the needy, and travelers—are interpreted as orphans, the needy, and travelers from Muhammad&#x27;s near relatives. Hence three-sixths of the khums are allocated to the members of Muhammad&#x27;s clan, the Banu Hashim (also called the Hashimites), to ensure that their standard of living corresponds to their high status in Islam. A Hashimite is defined as someone who is a descendant of Hashim, Muhammad&#x27;s great-grandfather. Among the Hashimites, those who descend from Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fatima, have precedence over others and are called &quot;sayyids&quot; (Arabic plural: &quot;sādāt&quot;). Therefore, the second half of khums is referred to as the share of the sayyids (Arabic: &quot;sahm as-sādāt&quot;; Persian: &quot;sahm-e sādāt&quot;). In non-Shi’i regions of the Arab world, the sayyids are often referred to as &quot;ashrāf&quot; (sing. &quot;sharīf&quot;). The recipients of khums must be Muslim.

Regarding who is responsible for the collection and distribution of khums in accordance with divine intention, the clergy (&quot;ulama&quot;) teach that they themselves are the rightful trustees for administering the assets of the Hidden Imam. The rationale is that they believe during the period of occultation, the share of the Hidden Imam should be used for purposes that align with the Imam&#x27;s approval. They hold that the best individuals to determine such purposes are the mujtahids. Consequently, the sahm al-Imam should be entrusted to the most learned and trustworthy mujtahid or utilized in a manner authorized by that mujtahid. The clergy collect both the sahm al-sadat and the sahm al-Imam, distributing the former while utilizing the sahm al-Imam in line with the assumed wishes of the Hidden Imam to benefit Islam and the ummah. By taking on the responsibility of distributing half of the khums to the Hashimites and managing the other half—the Imam&#x27;s share—as trustees, the clergy have gained control over vast sums of money. Over time, they have also come to control additional sources of income beyond khums. Any misuse of these funds is viewed as a serious offense against the Imam. While many—though not all—clergymen live ascetic lifestyles, there have been repeated complaints and criticisms about the perceived “greed” of the clergy.

Paying khums is to be considered not as a voluntary act of charity but as a religious obligation which must be fulfilled whether one likes it or not. Thus the Shia are required to pay the khums voluntarily as a form of self-taxation. Not paying khums is considered misappropriation of the wealth which rightfully belongs to the Imam and the indigent descendants of Muhammad. All Shi’is are free to decide which particular mujtahid they will pay their khums to. There are several ways to pay khums. An individual can give the khums to any clergyman, such as the local village mullah, who typically has a client relationship with a prominent mujtahid (i.e., ayatollah or grand ayatullah), passing on part of the collected funds to them. Generally, the mullah can keep one-third of the amount for the use of his village community. Residents of a village or city district, or members of an Ashura guild, can also send their khums to a mujtahid of their choice through a delegate and have a portion returned to them. The amount to be returned is usually negotiated with someone authorized by the mujtahid. For example, the son of Ayatullah al-Khu’i, a highly respected Iraqi religious leader who passed away in 1992, traveled to Hyderabad to collect khums from the faithful there. He announced that the ayatullah had allowed a local guild to use the entire amount collected for a local building project. The amount of khums collected can vary with time, depending on the overall economic well-being of the Shia community. When the community is economically stable, the revenue from khums tends to be significant but, during times of economic difficulty, the amount of khums is often limited.

The mujtahid spends the sahm al-Imam in the way which he thinks will be agreeable to the Hidden Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi. The causes for which the sahm al-Imam is spent presently may include:
* providing the expenditure of seminaries and other religious establishments, their teachers and their students, especially in the centers of religious learning such as Najaf and Qum.
* providing the household and academic expenses of the clergy
* providing the necessary expenses of the poor among the Twelver Shia
* public welfare projects, such as building hospitals
* propagating Islam among Muslims as well as non-Muslims
* paying for disaster relief
* jihad

Sayyids, as descendants of Muhammad, are not permitted to receive alms like zakat from non-Sayyids. However, they can receive khums from Sayyids and non-Sayyids alike. The sahm al-sadat portion of khums is given to the following among the Twelver Shia population:
* sayyids who are poor and needy;
* orphaned sayyids who are poor;
* those stranded travellers who are sayyid and have no funds to continue their journey back home, as long as the journey is not for a sinful purpose. Khums can be provided to assist such a traveler, even if he is wealthy in his own town.
It is prohibited to give khums to a sayyid who is likely to spend any of it on sinful activities, and it is considered advisable not to give it to sayyids who openly engage in what Islam considers immoral behavior, such as drinking alcohol. A layperson can directly give the sahm al-sadat portion of their khums payment to a deserving sayyid without going through the mujtahid. Ayatullah al-Khu&#x27;i stated that it is not necessary to seek his permission for distributing sahm al-sadat. In contrast, Ayatullah al-Gulpaygani taught that even sahm al-sadat should be channeled through the mujtahid, but he granted his followers a general permission to distribute sahm al-sadat directly.

The recipients of the sahm al-sadat can change with time, for example, an &#x27;orphan&#x27; ceases to be considered an orphan in Islamic law as soon as he reaches adulthood; a &#x27;needy&#x27; person ceases to be considered needy as soon he becomes financially independent; and a &#x27;stranded traveler&#x27; ceases to be considered a stranded traveler as soon as he reaches home.

===Role of khums in the independence of the clergy from the state===
During the Buyid era (322-454 AH/934–1062 CE), Shi’is enjoyed the patronage of the Buyid court in Baghdad and were assigned to important roles. Sharif al-Tahir al-Musawi (a descendant of the seventh Imam, Musa al-Kadhim) was frequently appointed as the official commander of the Iraqi pilgrim caravans to Mecca. He also served as the representative of Muhammad&#x27;s descendants (termed sayyids or sharifs), overseeing lineage matters and distributing income due to the descendants from endowments and khums. His sons, al-Sharif al-Radi (d. 406/1015) and al-Sharif al-Murtada (d. 436/1044), followed in his footsteps, continuing these responsibilities. During the time of al-Shaykh al-Tusi (d. 460/1067), the collection and use of khums were internal matters for the Shi’i religious community, rather than an official responsibility of the state, because the Shia were still a minority and held no state authority. This principle has largely remained in effect to this day.

In the Twelver Shi‘i system, jurists managed to maintain greater independence from the government, partly due to their reduced reliance on endowment income, which is more susceptible to confiscation or government control. Instead, the Shi‘i scholarly establishment was primarily supported by the payment of khums by lay believers directly to leading Shi‘i scholars. This income often crossed borders and remained beyond the reach of rulers. In contrast, Sunni scholars’ livelihood and appointment to the position of mufti or Shaykh al-Islam depended on the ruler of the country. Khums became a major source of income and financial independence for the clergy in Shi’i-dominated regions. This practice has continued among Shi’i Muslims.

The division of khums into two portions (one portion allocated to the mujtahids and the other portion to support the poor and orphaned descendants of Muhammad) provided the Shi’i clergy (&quot;ulama&quot;) in Iran with a source of income that granted them independence from the state. Those Shi’i clergy who were also sayyids benefited financially in particular, but importantly, this arrangement reinforced the authority of the jurists in various aspects of fiqh.

The Shi’i clergy were administrators of the khums, especially the “Imam’s share,” during the Safavid era (907-1148/1501-1736). During the Qajar era (1789-1925 CE), khums contributions helped maintain the independence of the clergy from the state and may have provided financial support for the clergy&#x27;s opposition movement in 20th-century Iran. Traditionally, the Imam&#x27;s permission is a crucial requirement for participating in jihad. Imami jurists argued that if warriors engage in battle without the Imam&#x27;s prior approval, all booty acquired belongs to the Imam. However, if jihad is conducted with the Imam&#x27;s consent, then four-fifths of the spoils are divided among the warriors, while one-fifth goes to the Imam. Items obtained without force are classified as &quot;fayʾ&quot;, meaning they are considered the personal property of Muhammad, and subsequently, that of the Imam. In the early nineteenth century, Russia began to expand into territories south of the Caucasus Mountains (Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan), which Iran had conquered at the end of the sixteenth century. As Iranian defenses faltered, Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797–1834) faced mounting pressure. There was concern that the Muslim populations of the Caucasus might fall under the control of non-Muslims, creating a classic scenario that called for jihad. In 1809, one of the most prominent Shi’i scholars of the time, Shaykh Ja’far Kashif al-Ghita (d. 1228/1813), asserted that during the occultation of the Twelfth Imam, scholars not only had the right but the duty to exercise ijtihad to determine if jihad is deemed necessary, and if it is found to be necessary, they must declare jihad. Kashif al-Ghita believed he was justified in this decision as a mujtahid. He urged the inactive shah to prepare for jihad against the Russians and demanded that the “imam’s share” (sahm al-imam)—half of the khums collected from believers—be allocated for this purpose. Ultimately, the shah yielded to the pressures from the clergy, which had devastating consequences: in the second war with Russia, Iran lost the three provinces south of the Caucasus, which were ceded to Tsarist Russia in the 1828 peace treaty of Turkumenchay.

The Usuli Twelver jurist Muhammad Hasan al-Najafi (d. 1266/1849) was the first mujtahid to delegate his clerical authority to lower-ranking scholars in various urban centers. By establishing a network of representatives, he created a centralized system for the collection of khums and legal administration. This system not only generated a significant source of income and political power that transcended formal political boundaries but also ensured the clerical independence from state authorities.

The Shi’i clergy maintains a close relationship with traditional businesses (the &quot;bāzār&quot;) in Iranian cities, including handcrafts, trade, and moneylending. The social ties between the mullahs and the predominantly middle-class businesspeople stem not only from their own backgrounds and familial connections but also from their financial dependence on this group. The khums, which includes the “imam’s share” managed by the mullahs, is primarily collected from the income of bazar merchants. Since all Shi’is can choose which mujtahid to pay their khums to, traditional Iranian businesspeople—the &quot;bāzāris&quot;—wield a form of control; they can support specific mujtahids with their loyalty and financial contributions, allowing others to struggle without support. Mujtahids unable to make charitable contributions, such as providing for their students&#x27; basic needs, risk losing their influence. Around 1850, the Qajar shahs, similar to the Ottoman sultans in Istanbul, began a series of reforms aimed at modernizing Iran along European lines. Nasir al-Din Shah (r. 1848–1896) introduced European advisors in military, judicial, and educational sectors, as well as European capital and entrepreneurs who established themselves in Iran and took control of crucial segments of the economy. This shift threatened the bazaris, who feared that their impoverishment would lead to a decline in khums revenue. Additionally, with the establishment of modern educational institutions and judicial systems modeled after European examples, the Shi’i clergy lost two areas of influence they had long monopolized.

The alliance between the bazar and the clergy, the income from the khums and the independence khums granted the clergy from the state played significant roles in the success of the Islamic revolution of 1979.

==Khums in history==

===Africa===
Khums was practiced by Muslim commanders who raided African communities from the 8th century through the early 20th century. However, khums was treated as a concept and the share of booty transferred to the Islamic state was 50%. For example, in 1919, the West African Muslim ruler Hamman Yaji recorded the following in his diary,

Similarly, from 8th to 10th century, the Berber people in North Africa were treated as pagans, raided and the booty of seized wealth and slaves were subject to khums.

===Europe===
From the 8th century onwards, Southern Europe became a target of raids and military campaigns from Morocco and by the Ottoman Sultanate. After the conquest of Cordoba by Muslim armies, khums (20%) of all moveable booty seized from Christians and Jews after the war was transferred to the caliphal treasury, the rest was distributed among the commanders and Muslim soldiers of the invading army. According to Musa Nusayr, the army commanders also set aside 20% of land vacated by non-Muslims to the caliph. The land that was surrendered by Christians and Jews, but not vacated, became subject to &quot;jizya&quot; payable by the &quot;dhimmis&quot;. However, Ibn Hazm states that Muslim soldiers did not set aside or pay khums from the looted property or riches from the annexed land, each kept the spoils for himself. This became one source of distrust and dispute between the Muslim rulers and clergy based in Africa and the new Caliphate of Cordoba in Southwestern Europe. Outside Spain, &quot;Ghanima&quot; and &quot;fayʾ&quot; were sought from Muslim conquests in Sicily, Greece and Caucasian region of Europe. Khums was paid from all seized movable property to the caliphal treasury.

===India===
From the 10th century through the 18th century, Muslim armies raided non-Muslim kingdoms of India. Some of these Muslim armies came from the northwest, consisting of Turko-Mongols, Persians and Afghans. In other times, these were commanders of Delhi Sultanate. War spoils and looted movable property from non-muslims was subject to khums. The 20% tax was transferred to the treasury of the sultanate, and the 80% was distributed among the commanders, mounted soldiers and foot soldiers. The mounted soldiers were given two to three times as much of the war booty as the foot soldiers. The collected war booty from the treasuries and temples of Hindus were an incentive for war, and the Khums (&quot;Ghanima&quot; tax) was a source of wealth for the sultans in India. One batch of loot was from Warangal, and it included the Koh-i-Noor, one of the largest known diamonds in human history.

<text>Enkidu ( &quot;EN.KI.DU10&quot;) was a legendary figure in ancient Mesopotamian mythology, wartime comrade and friend of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Their exploits were composed in Sumerian poems and in the Akkadian &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, written during the 2nd millennium BC. He is the oldest literary representation of the wild man, a recurrent motif in artistic representations in Mesopotamia and in Ancient Near East literature. The apparition of Enkidu as a primitive man seems to be a potential parallel of the Old Babylonian version (1300–1000 BC), in which he was depicted as a servant-warrior in the Sumerian poems.

There have been suggestions that he may be the &quot;bull-man&quot; shown in Mesopotamian art, having the head, arms, and body of a man, and the horns, ears, tail and legs of a bull. Thereafter a series of interactions with humans and human ways bring him closer to civilization, culminating in a wrestling match with Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Enkidu embodies the wild or natural world. Though equal to Gilgamesh in strength and bearing, he acts in some ways as an antithesis to the cultured, city-bred warrior-king.

The tales of Enkidu’s servitude are narrated in five surviving Sumerian poems, developing from a slave of Gilgamesh into a close comrade by the last poem, which describes Enkidu as Gilgamesh&#x27;s friend. In the epic, Enkidu is created as a rival to king Gilgamesh, who tyrannizes his people, but they become friends and together slay the monster Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven; because of this, Enkidu is punished and dies, representing the mighty hero who dies early. The deep, tragic loss of Enkidu profoundly inspires in Gilgamesh a quest to escape death by obtaining godly immortality.

Enkidu has virtually no existence outside the stories relating to Gilgamesh. To the extent of current knowledge, he was never a god to be worshipped, and is absent from the lists of deities of ancient Mesopotamia. He seems to appear in an invocation from the Paleo-Babylonian era aimed at silencing a crying baby, a text which also evokes the fact that Enkidu would be held to have determined the measurement of the passage of time at night, apparently in relation to his role as herd keeper at night in the epic.

==Etymology==
The name of Enkidu is Sumerian, and generally written in texts in this language by the sequence of signs en.ki.du10. The phrase ki.du10 (&quot;good place&quot;) is well attested in the Early Dynastic personal names, and the name en.ki.du10.ga (&quot;Lord of the good place&quot;) is cited on the Fara tablets. The lack of genitive or any grammatical element was common until the late third millennium. However, an alternative translation has been proposed as &quot;Creation of Enki&quot;.

In the epic, his name is preceded by the determinative sign of the divinity &quot;dingir&quot; 𒀭, which means that this character was considered to be of divine essence.

==Sumerian poems==
=== &quot;The envoys of Agga&quot; ===
Uruk refuses to participate in the digging of wells for the benefit of Kish, whose kingdom had the hegemony of Sumer. Its king Agga submits the city to a siege. Enkidu is sent to prepare the weapons and wait for Gilgamesh&#x27;s order. After the battle, Gilgamesh defeats Agga, and makes him return, defeated and humiliated, to Kish.

=== &quot;The lord to the Living One&#x27;s Mountain&quot; ===
Gilgamesh, disturbed by the death of his subjects and by the brevity of human existence, decides to make a name for himself. The king of Uruk and Enkidu make an expedition to the Forest of the Cedars, where, with Utu&#x27;s blessing, they traverse seven mountains. Enkidu warns the king that the monster Huwawa inhabits the mountain region, armed by seven supernatural Auras. However, Gilgamesh has no fear, and his fifty men cut the trees until Huwawa appears. Gilgamesh offers him seven gifts in exchange for leaving his seven Auras, but it is a trap. He strikes Huwawa several times, who asks for mercy. Although Gilgamesh softens his heart, Enkidu nevertheless decapitates the monster. Enlil reproaches them for his death, and distributes the seven auras to the fields, the rivers, the reed-beds, the lions, the palace, the forest and Nungal, which would explain the fear and fascination they give to the humans.

=== &quot;Hero in battle&quot; ===
Inanna is enraged with Gilgamesh, she forbids him from administering justice in her temple, the Eanna, causing unrest in the environment of the King of Uruk. Finally, Inanna demands, with threats, from her father the Bull of Heaven to kill Gilgamesh. The bull is released in Uruk, whose insatiable hunger destroys crops and rivers. Enkidu grabs the bull by his tail and Gilgamesh smashes its head. Finally they distribute the meat among the poor and transform the horns into cups for ointments for the Eanna.

=== &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld&quot; ===
An oak tree grows on the banks of the Euphrates, the south wind blows it away and the goddess Inanna gathers it, planting it in her garden to use its wood as her throne. Suddenly, a snake takes refuge between its roots, a giant eagle on its top and a female demon between them.

Inanna asks her brother Utu for help, in vain, and then Gilgamesh. Gilgamesh cuts the tree, kills the serpent, expels the eagle to the mountain, and the demon to the desert. Inanna gives Gilgamesh a drum (ellag) and drumsticks (ekidma), in some versions a rod and a ring. Eventually they end up falling to the Netherworld.

Enkidu offers to recover them, but not before receiving instructions from Gilgamesh on how to behave in the underworld, to not seem alive in the residence of the dead. Enkidu however, ignores the directions; consequently, Enkidu ends up being held forever in the Netherworld.

After Gilgamesh pleads to the gods to set his companion free, Enki finally causes the shade of Enkidu to rise to briefly reunite with Gilgamesh. The latter interrogates the former (whom from now on he calls his &quot;friend&quot;) the fate of the dead, Enkidu answers each of his questions. The text is lost here.
&lt;poem&gt;Did you see him who fell in battle?
I saw him [...] his father and mother are not there to hold his head, and his wife weeps.&lt;/poem&gt;

=== &quot;The great wild bull is lying down&quot; ===
Gilgamesh is dying. The gods judge his exploits. After his position as future judge of the underworld has been revealed to him, he offers gifts and sacrifices to the gods. Then he takes comfort in the words of the gods; after death, he will be reunited with his family, his priests, his warriors and his best friend, Enkidu. Finally, he dies.

== &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; ==
The Akkadian epic Gilgamesh is found in various versions, including &quot;Surpassing all other kings&quot; () and &quot;He who saw the Deep&quot; (), which was compiled by Sin-liqe-unninni from earlier texts, later discovered in the Library of Ashurbanipal in 1853.

=== Creation of Enkidu ===
Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, abuses his people. In response to complaints from the citizens, the goddess Aruru creates Enkidu in the steppe. Abundantly hairy and primitive, he lives roaming with the herds and grazing and drinking from rivers with the beasts.
One day a hunter watches Enkidu destroying the traps he has prepared for the animals. The hunter informs his father, who sends him to Uruk to ask Gilgamesh for help. The king sends Shamhat, a sacred prostitute, who seduces and teaches Enkidu. After two weeks with her, he becomes human, intelligent and understanding words, however the beasts flee when they see him. Shamhat convinces Enkidu to face the tyrant Gilgamesh in combat. Meanwhile, in Uruk, the king has two dreams prophesying the arrival of his enemy.

=== Enkidu faces Gilgamesh ===
Enkidu learns to behave like a man with the shepherds eating, drinking and defending them from wolves and lions at night. Upon reaching Uruk, Enkidu blocks the path of Gilgamesh who was going to sleep with a newlywed. Enraged, they fight brutally until the two end up tired, but at the end both appreciate each other&#x27;s strength, and decide to be friends. Enkidu is depressed by having abandoned his old wild life, to which Gilgamesh proposes an expedition to the Cedar Forest to kill Humbaba. But his friend explains that he knew the forest while he was a wild being, and that the expedition is dangerous. At the end, Gilgamesh decides to march without fear. The decision is acclaimed by the citizens of Uruk, but not by the elders and advisers. Faced with Gilgamesh&#x27;s disregard, the elders charge Enkidu to protect their king.

&lt;poem&gt;The one who goes on ahead saves the comrade.
The one who knows the route protects his friend.&#x27;Let Enkidu go ahead of you; he knows the road to the Cedar Forest.&lt;/poem&gt;

In this same episode the goddess Ninsun adopts Enkidu and also entrusts him with protecting the king.

=== The forest of Humbaba ===
Ninsun, the mother of Gilgamesh adopts Enkidu as her son, and seeks protection of the sun-god Shamash (the protector of the Uruk dynasty). Gilgamesh and Enkidu journey to the Cedar Forest. They perform a dream ritual in every mountain they cross; although dreams are representations of Humbaba (falling mountains, a thunderbird that breathes fire…), Enkidu interprets them as good omens. At the entrance to the forest they hear the fearsome bellow of Humbaba, which petrifies them with fear.

Humbaba descends from the mountain face to face with both heroes, there accuses Enkidu of betrayal against the beasts and threatens Gilgamesh to disembowel him and feed his flesh to the birds. Gilgamesh is terrified, but Enkidu encourages him, and the battle begins. First, Gilgamesh strikes Humbaba so hard it splits the Mount Hermon in two, and the skies turn black and start “raining death”. Shamash binds Humbaba with 13 winds and he is captured. Humbaba pleads for his life, offers to be his slave and to cut the sacred trees for him, Gilgamesh pities him, but Enkidu argues that his death will establish his reputation forever. Humbaba then curses both heroes, but they strike him, decapitating him. They cut down cedars and a gigantic tree that Enkidu plans to use for a gate for the temple of Enlil. They return home along the Euphrates with the trees and the head of Humbaba.

=== Ishtar&#x27;s seduction ===
The goddess Ishtar, fascinated by the beauty of Gilgamesh, offers to be his wife in exchange for wealth and fame; these offerings do not sway Gilgamesh, who recalls all the misadventures her previous loves had, such as Tammuz.
Ishtar, furious and crying, goes to her father Anu, to demand the Bull of Heaven take revenge, or she will scream so loudly that the dead will devour the living. Anu, in fear, gives her the Bull from Heaven in exchange for preparing food for the seven years of famine that the city will suffer from the destruction of the bull. Ishtar obeys (or lies) and releases the bull in Uruk, which kills a large percentage of people. Enkidu grabs the bull by the horns and Gilgamesh stabs his neck. Hearing Ishtar&#x27;s cry, Enkidu ridicules the goddess by throwing a bull&#x27;s leg at her head. The city prepares a great celebration at night.

=== Death of Enkidu ===
Enkidu has a dream where the gods decide that the heroes must die, since they have killed Humbaba and the Bull of Heaven. Samash protests against the decision, but that does not change anything, and Enkidu is sentenced to death. This makes Enkidu curse the door he built with the wood of the forest and Shamhat, for having changed his wild life. However then he repents and blesses her. He discusses his nightmares with Gilgamesh about witnessing before Ereshkigal, the queen of the underworld.
After this, sick and bedridden for twelve days, he asks Gilgamesh not to forget him. Finally, he dies.
Gilgamesh calls upon the mountains and all of Uruk to mourn for his friend. He recalls their adventures together, makes a funerary statue of Enkidu and provides grave gifts, so Enkidu has a favourable life in the realm of the dead. Enkidu is buried in the river, like Gilgamesh in the Sumerian poem.

=== Enkidu&#x27;s descent to the Underworld ===
There is another non-canonical tablet in which Enkidu journeys into the underworld, but many scholars consider the tablet to be a sequel or add-on to the original epic inspired by the Sumerian poem Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld.

==Symbolism==
===Enkidu&#x27;s wild life===
It has often been suggested that these descriptions reflect the semi-nomadic Amorites who, from their homeland in the Syrian Desert, infiltrated southern Mesopotamia and came to dominate it in the early second millennium. The phraseology generally includes a reference to &quot;not knowing&quot;, which is also used in the epic. Comparing their behaviour to animals, &quot;people plotting destruction like beasts, like wolves&quot;. However, Amorites ate uncooked meat and lived in tents while Enkidu lived in the steppe and ate grass; meaning there is no correlation between both since Enkidu wasn’t even a human yet. However, Morris Jastrow suggested that Enkidu&#x27;s early life was modeled on a tradition that can be seen in etiological texts, in parallel to the description of Enkidu.

===Becoming human===
After bouts of love-making with Shamhat over two weeks, Enkidu tries to reunite with his herd. But the gazelles run from him, indicating that he is not accepted any more amongst the savage kind. Enkidu has lost his primitive nature, such as running as fast as a gazelle.

We can see here the motif of transferring negative or positive qualities (weakness or knowledge) from one being to another through intimate contact. Another motif is the role of women as seducer towards civilization, such as Adam and Eve in Genesis 3. By offering Adam the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Eve ultimately drew him to a life of sin and turmoil with Eve being to the pain of childbirth.

Jastrow and Clay are of the opinion that the story of Enkidu was originally a separate tale to illustrate &quot;man&#x27;s career and destiny, how through intercourse with a woman he awakens to the sense of human dignity...&quot;

===Civilization against nomadic life===
There is a theme that contrasts life with human culture and the life without. It can be seen when Enkidu curses Shamhat, because she took him away from the wild life and brought him to civilization, leading to his death. The sun god Shamash convinces him that he had a new life worth enjoying.

&lt;poem&gt;Why, Ο Enkidu, do you curse the harlot Shamhat,
Who made you eat food fit for divinity,
Who gave you to drink wine fit for royalty,
Who clothed you with noble garments,
And made you have fair Gilgamesh for a comrade?&lt;/poem&gt;

The same theme appears when the barmaid advises Gilgamesh to abandon his search for immortality.

&lt;poem&gt;As for you, Gilgamesh [...]
Let your head be washed; bathe in water.
Pay heed to a little one that holds on to your hand;
Let a spouse delight in your bosom.&lt;/poem&gt;

As Jeffrey H. Tigay wrote in his book, &quot;The Evolution of the Gilgamesh Epic&quot;:

==Modern rediscovery==
The first translation of the Epic of Gilgamesh was produced in the early 1870s by George Smith, a scholar at the British Museum, who published the Flood story from Tablet XI in 1880 under the title The Chaldean Account of Genesis. There, Enkidu&#x27;s name was originally misread as Eabani.

<text>Brading Down is a chalk down southwest of Brading, Isle of Wight. It is a prominent hill which overlooks Sandown Bay, with views across the bay towards Shanklin, Sandown and Culver Down. It is a Local Nature Reserve.

Parts of the down are private, including an area used as a covered reservoir, and some for agriculture. However, much of the down, approximately , is open to the public and is owned by the Isle of Wight Council and managed by Gift to Nature. The main area of Brading Down is fenced and grazed but access on foot and for horse riders is available from the many pathways entering the area, and the car parks bordering the main Newport to Brading Road.

The thin chalk soils to the east of the site support a typical downland plant community with pyramidal orchids being a particular feature in the summer. In recent years, a programme of scrub clearance has been undertaken. The area is good for butterflies including common blue, chalkhill blue, small, large and dingy skippers, marbled white, gatekeeper, and meadow brown.

In addition to the wildlife interest of chalk downland, the ancient field system on Brading Down is a Scheduled Monument. The finest surviving ancient field system on the Island is to be found on the down. This is likely to be of late Iron Age or Roman date and highlights the last time the fields were ploughed. Nearby is Brading Roman Villa. Further down the slopes, First World War practice trenches and former chalk pits show evidence of more recent archaeological interest.

<text>James Andrew Wynn Jr. (born March 17, 1954) is an American jurist. He serves as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and formerly served on both the North Carolina Court of Appeals and the North Carolina Supreme Court.

==Background==

Wynn grew up in the Eastern North Carolina community of Robersonville, one of eight children. His family operated a farm on which he worked during his childhood.

He holds degrees from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Bachelor of Arts, Journalism, 1975); Marquette University Law School (Juris Doctor, 1979); and the University of Virginia School of Law (Master of Laws, Judicial Process, 1995).

==Early career==

Following graduation from law school, Wynn served for four years on active duty in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps, U.S. Navy. He was stationed in Norfolk, Virginia. He continued his service for 26 more years in the U.S. Naval Reserve, which included service as a military judge. He retired in 2009 at the rank of captain.

Following his active-duty military service, Wynn briefly served as an Assistant Appellate Defender for the State of North Carolina before joining the Wilson, North Carolina law firm of Fitch &amp; Butterfield—later known as Fitch, Butterfield &amp; Wynn.

== Judicial career ==
=== State judicial service ===

From 1990 to 2010, Wynn served on both the North Carolina Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court of North Carolina.

=== Federal judicial service ===

====Nominations under Clinton====

On August 5, 1999, President Bill Clinton nominated Wynn to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to fill a vacancy created by Judge James Dickson Phillips Jr.&#x27;s decision to assumed senior status in 1994. The nomination was part of an effort to integrate the Fourth Circuit, which, despite representing the largest per-capita African American population of any judicial circuit, had never had an African American judge. At the time, the Fourth Circuit was the only circuit to never have had a person of color serve as a circuit judge.

Citing testimony before the U.S. Senate that the Fourth Circuit did not need any more judges, North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms refused to submit a blue slip that would have allowed Wynn a hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. This left the seat vacated by Judge James Dickson Phillips Jr. in 1994 vacant until Wynn&#x27;s ultimate confirmation in 2010. It also left the court without North Carolina representation for four years (from the death of Judge Samuel James Ervin III in September 1999 until Judge Allyson K. Duncan arrived on the court in August 2003). Ultimately, President Clinton issued a recess appointment to Judge Roger Gregory of Virginia in December 2000, making him the first African American judge to sit on the Fourth Circuit.

President Clinton nominated Wynn a second time on January 3, 2001, shortly before leaving office. The nomination was withdrawn by President George W. Bush two months later.

====Nomination under Obama====

On November 4, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Wynn and Special Superior Court Judge for Complex Business Cases Albert Diaz for seats on the Fourth Circuit. Obama&#x27;s renomination of Wynn and nomination of Diaz were jointly endorsed by North Carolina senators Kay Hagan, a Democrat, and Richard Burr, a Republican. His nomination was confirmed by the full Senate on August 5, 2010, by unanimous consent. He received his commission on August 10, 2010. 

====Senior Status reversal controversy====
On January 9, 2024, Wynn announced his intent to assume senior status upon confirmation of a successor. President Biden nominated North Carolina Solicitor General Ryan Park for the seat but his nomination never received a vote on the Senate floor prior to the 2024 Presidential election which was won by Donald Trump. On December 13, 2024, Wynn rescinded his senior status announcement, opting to remain an active judge on the Fourth Circuit and therefore depriving Trump the opportunity to nominate his replacement. Senator Tillis described the announcement as a &#x27;partisan&#x27; decision that demonstrated that &quot;some judges are nothing more than politicians in robes&quot;. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, suggested that Wynn would face ethics complaints and requests for recusals in cases involving the incoming Trump administration.

==Notable cases==
=== &quot;Liberty University, Inc. v. Geithner&quot;, 671 F.3d 391 (4th Cir. 2011) ===
In a concurring opinion, Wynn became the first federal judge, and only lower-federal-court judge, to conclude that Congress had the authority to establish the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act pursuant to its plenary taxing power. The Supreme Court subsequently upheld the individual mandate under that theory in &quot;NFIB v. Sebelius&quot;.

=== North Carolina Voting Rights Cases ===
In 2014, Wynn wrote the majority opinion preliminarily enjoining portions of a North Carolina law that denied minority groups equal access to voting. &quot;League of Women Voters of North Carolina v. North Carolina&quot;, 769 F.3d 224 (4th Cir. 2014). Wynn was later a member of a panel that held that the provisions of the law that required photo identification to vote, reduced early-voting opportunities, and eliminated out-of-precinct voting, same-day registration, and pre-registration, were enacted with discriminatory intent, and thus, were unconstitutional. &quot;North Carolina State Conference of NAACP v. McCrory&quot;, 831 F.3d 204 (4th Cir. 2016). The majority held that the North Carolina General Assembly&#x27;s &quot;new provisions target[ed] African Americans with almost surgical precision.&quot; Wynn wrote the section of the majority opinion as to remedy, permanently enjoining the State from implementing the unconstitutional provisions. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case, leaving the Fourth Circuit&#x27;s holding in place.

=== Partisan Gerrymandering ===
In August 2018, Wynn wrote the majority opinion for a three-judge district court panel striking down North Carolina&#x27;s congressional districts on grounds that the state&#x27;s 2016 districting plan constituted a partisan gerrymander in violation of Article I of the Constitution and the First and Fourteenth Amendments. &quot;Common Cause v. Rucho&quot;, 318 F. Supp. 3d 777 (M.D.N.C. 2018). The Supreme Court vacated Wynn&#x27;s opinion, holding that the case presented a nonjusticiable political question because there are no &quot;judicially manageable standards&quot; with which to measure political gerrymandering. &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;, 139 S. Ct. 2484 (2019). Wynn has been outspoken about his disagreement with the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision.

=== &quot;Long v. Hooks&quot;, 972 F.3d 442 (4th Cir. 2020) (en banc) ===
In 1976, an all-white North Carolina jury convicted a Black man, Ronnie Long, of raping a white woman. Decades later, new evidence that had not been disclosed to the defense came to light. The defendant sought habeas relief. The en banc majority remanded the case to the district court for further consideration. Wynn authored a concurring opinion, arguing that the court should grant immediate relief. Wynn reasoned that no reasonable jury could convict the defendant based on the new evidence.

During oral arguments, Wynn questioned why, if the State&#x27;s goal was to seek justice, it was not willing to look at the new evidence. He also called attention to the racial dynamics at play. The case involved police officers failing to disclose key evidence and lying on the stand. He noted that numerous Black men had been wrongfully prosecuted at the time and cited the country&#x27;s history of lynchings.

Less than four months after the case was decided, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper pardoned Long.

=== &quot;Peltier v. Charter Day School, Inc.&quot; (4th Cir. 2022) (en banc) ===
In a 10–6 decision, joined by Judge Wynn, the full court held that a public charter school was a state actor for the purposes of 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Senior Judge Barbara Milano Keenan, writing for the majority, also concluded that the school’s dress code, which &quot;requires female students to wear skirts to school based on the view that girls are &#x27;fragile vessels&#x27; deserving of &#x27;gentle&#x27; treatment by boys,&quot; plainly violates the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause.

Wynn penned a concurrence joined by four other judges critiquing policy arguments raised by some of the dissenting judges. He dismissed concerns that the majority&#x27;s Equal Protection holding would threaten historically Black colleges and universities, pointing out that just because an &quot;institution is &quot;historically&quot; Black . . . does not mean that school is &quot;currently engaging in racial discrimination&quot;.&quot; He also rejected the dissenting judges&#x27; argument that &quot;subjecting schools like Charter Day to the demands of the Constitution&quot; will stifle &quot;educational progress,&quot; noting that &quot;[t]wo hundred and fifty years of innovation and ingenuity—&quot;enabled&quot; by our American constitutional system—say otherwise.&quot;

=== &quot;Nelson v. Freeland&quot;, 349 N.C. 615 (1998) ===
During his tenure on the Supreme Court of North Carolina, Wynn authored an opinion abolishing the longstanding invitee/licensee framework for evaluating premises-liability claims and replacing it with a new standard under which property owners owe a duty of reasonable care to all lawful visitors.

=== &quot;United States v. Graham&quot;, 824 F.3d 421 (4th Cir. 2016) (en banc) ===
Wynn wrote an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, arguing that cell site location information is not voluntarily conveyed by cell phone users and, therefore, is protected by the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court subsequently agreed. &quot;Carpenter v. United States&quot;, 138 S. Ct. 2206 (2018).

=== &quot;International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump&quot;, 857 F.3d 554 (4th Cir. 2017) (en banc) ===
Wynn wrote a concurring opinion contending that President Trump&#x27;s &quot;travel ban&quot; exceeded the President&#x27;s authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act because it denied entry to a class of aliens on the basis of invidious discrimination. Wynn&#x27;s opinion was grounded in the interpretive principle that absent a clear statement by Congress, courts should not construe a delegation of congressional power as authorizing the delegates to exercise that power in a manner that curtails or dilutes fundamental rights.

=== &quot;G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board&quot;, 972 F.3d 586 (4th Cir. 2020) ===
In August 2020, Wynn joined the majority in G. G. v. Gloucester County School Board. In a 2–1 decision, the court held that a Virginia school board violated Title IX when it prevented a transgender man from using the boys&#x27; bathroom. Judge Henry F. Floyd wrote for the majority that &quot;[a]t the heart of this appeal is whether equal protection and Title IX can protect transgender students from school bathroom policies that prohibit them from affirming their gender. We join a growing consensus of courts in holding that the answer is resoundingly yes.&quot; Wynn, concurring, wrote thatthe Board&#x27;s classification on the basis of &quot;biological gender&quot;—defined in this appeal as the sex marker on a student&#x27;s birth certificate—is arbitrary and provides no consistent reason to assign transgender students to bathrooms on a binary male/female basis. Rather, the Board&#x27;s use of &quot;biological gender&quot; to classify students has the effect of shunting individuals like Grimm—who may not use the boys’ bathrooms because of their &quot;biological gender,&quot; and who cannot use the girls’ bathrooms because of their gender identity—to a third category of bathroom altogether: the “alternative appropriate private facilit[ies]&quot; established in the policy for &quot;students with gender identity issues.&quot; That is indistinguishable from the sort of separate-but-equal treatment that is anathema under our jurisprudence. No less than the recent historical practice of segregating Black and white restrooms, schools, and other public accommodations, the unequal treatment enabled by the Board&#x27;s policy produces a vicious and ineradicable stigma.The Supreme Court declined to grant review, leaving the Fourth Circuit&#x27;s holding in place.

=== &quot;Hirschfeld v. Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco and Explosives&quot;, 5 F.4th 407 (4th Cir. 2021) ===
In July 2021, Wynn dissented from a Fourth Circuit panel&#x27;s decision to strike down as unconstitutional a longstanding federal statute preventing federally licensed gun dealers from selling handguns to individuals under the age of 21.

=== &quot;Cawthorn v. Amalfi&quot;, 35 F.4th 245 (4th Cir. 2022) ===
In a concurring opinion, Wynn became the first federal appellate judge to conclude that Article I, Section 5 does not render states &quot;powerless to regulate candidates or ballot access&quot; for congressional office. He observed that by its plain terms, Article I, Section 5 &quot;only applies to Congress&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;own Members&quot;,&#x27;&quot; so Congress must lack &quot;exclusive control to judge the qualifications of &quot;non&quot;members, including candidates.&quot; A contrary holding, he wrote, would not only do violence to the Constitution&#x27;s text but would also mean states would be unable to prevent &quot;&#x27;fraudulent or unqualified candidates such as minors, out-of-state residents, or foreign nationals&#x27; from running for office.&quot; And &quot;[n]either the Constitution, nor Supreme Court precedent, nor common sense supports that irrational result.&quot;

=== &quot;E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. v. Kolon Industries&quot;, 637 F.3d 435 (4th Cir. 2011) ===
Wynn authored one of the first opinions applying the plausibility pleading standard set forth in &quot;Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly&quot;, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), to an attempted monopolization case under Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The opinion discusses at length what types of facts a complaint must allege to sufficiently plead a relevant geographic market.

== Madison Lecture ==
The Madison Lecture, &quot;the most important lecture series&quot; at NYU School of Law, is &quot;designed to enhance the appreciation of civil liberty and strengthen the sense of national purpose.&quot; Wynn&#x27;s 2020 lecture explained his definition of judicial activism, exemplified by the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;. He proposed that a court engages in judicial activism if it fails to consider well-established decisional tools that are relevant to deciding a particular case. Wynn contended that textualism is a type of judicial activism because it permits judges to disregard legislative history. Wynn further argued that &quot;Rucho&quot; is an activist opinion because it disregarded several well-established decisional tools.

<doc id="1112321" wikidata="Q7145869" url="?curid=1112321" title="Patricia Timmons-Goodson">
<text>Patricia Ann &quot;Pat&quot; Timmons-Goodson (born September 18, 1954) is an American judge and politician who served on the North Carolina Supreme Court from 2006 to 2012. She previously served on the United States Commission on Civil Rights and is a former nominee to be a federal judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. Timmons-Goodson ran for Congress in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Timmons-Goodson was born in Florence, South Carolina, the daughter of a U.S. Army enlisted man (Sergeant First Class) and homemaker, and was raised on military bases in the United States and Europe. She attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in speech in 1976. She received a Juris Doctor in 1979 from University of North Carolina School of Law. In 2014, she received a Master of Laws degree in Judicial Studies from the Duke University School of Law.

Timmons-Goodson wrote that she was inspired to become a judge after Judge Elreta Alexander-Ralston visited her speech class in 1974. Alexander-Ralston was the first black judge Timmons-Goodson had met, and her powerful speech and elegant presentation were inspiring.

== Career ==
She began her career working as a district manager for the United States Census Bureau’s Charlotte Regional Office, from 1979 to 1980. From 1981 to 1983, she served as an assistant district attorney for the Office of the District Attorney for the 12th judicial district in Fayetteville, North Carolina. From 1983 to 1984, she was a staff attorney for Lumbee River Legal Services.

She was named a Cumberland County District Court Judge in 1984; she was subsequently elected as a Democrat to four-year terms as a district judge in 1986, 1990, and 1994. In 1997, she was appointed by Governor Jim Hunt to the North Carolina Court of Appeals. She retired from that court in late 2005. On January 19, 2006, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley appointed her to the North Carolina Supreme Court to take the place of Associate Justice Sarah Parker. Upon taking her seat in February 2006, she was the first African-American woman to serve on the Court. She was elected by the voters to remain on the Court in November 2006, defeating Judge Eric Levinson. She made it known in November 2012 that she would resign her seat before the end of the year. Court of Appeals Judge Cheri Beasley was appointed to fill her seat.

Timmons-Goodson was inducted into the North Carolina Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2014, President Barack Obama appointed her to the United States Commission on Civil Rights. She formerly served as the Vice Chair of the Commission.

===Expired nomination to district court===

On April 28, 2016, President Obama nominated Timmons-Goodson to serve as a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, to the seat vacated by Judge Malcolm Jones Howard, who took senior status on December 31, 2005. Her nomination expired on January 3, 2017, with the end of the 114th Congress.

===2020 campaign for Congress===
In 2019, Timmons-Goodson filed to run for the United States House of Representatives seat representing North Carolina&#x27;s 8th congressional district. The 8th district covered all or part of 7 counties including Cabarrus, Stanly, Montgomery, Moore, Lee, Harnett, and Cumberland. Timmons-Goodson lost to incumbent Republican Richard Hudson in the general election in November 2020, by 53% to 47%.

===Academia===
On July 1, 2023, Timmons-Goodson was named Dean of North Carolina Central University School of Law. Back in 2012, she wrote a detailed tribute to one of her inspirations, Judge Elreta Alexander-Ralston, which helped uncover Alexander-Ralston&#x27;s legacy for modern audiences.

<text>Robert Carl &quot;Bob&quot; Hunter (born January 14, 1944) is an American jurist, who served as a Judge of the North Carolina Court of Appeals from 1998 through 2014.

Hunter, born in Marion, North Carolina, earned a degree in political science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1966 before earning his Juris Doctor degree from the same institution in 1969. While at UNC-Chapel Hill, he became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega. After earning his degree, Hunter worked as a county attorney in McDowell County, North Carolina. He also represented the 49th District in the North Carolina House of Representatives from 1980 to 1998. Significant legislation passed during his tenure included the Highway Trust Fund, NC Victims&#x27; Bill of Rights, NC Victims&#x27; Compensation Fund, and the establishment of Lake James State Park.

In 1998, Hunter was appointed by Gov. Jim Hunt to the state Court of Appeals, and he was elected to an eight-year term on the court that same year. In 2006, Hunter won the plurality of votes in the state&#x27;s non-partisan primary on May 2, thus advancing to the November general election. Winning 99 of 100 counties, he defeated Kris Bailey in that election to win another eight-year term. He announced in 2013 that he would retire at the end of his term rather than seek re-election in 2014. During his tenure on the Court of Appeals, Hunter decided over 4,000 appellate cases and authored over 1,500 opinions.

Hunter has been active in community and nonprofit organizations. He is a board member of both the N.C. Healthy Start Foundation and Southmountain Children&#x27;s Services, and he is a member of the Rotary Club of Raleigh, McDowell Economic Development Association, and the McDowell Chamber of Commerce.

Hunter ran for the North Carolina Supreme Court in 2002 and in 2010, losing to Robert F. Orr and to Barbara Jackson, respectively.

He is married and has two children.

<text>J. Douglas McCullough is an American lawyer and former judge of the North Carolina Court of Appeals. McCullough retired in 2017.

==Education and career==
After earning a history degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1967 and a Juris Doctor degree from the University of South Carolina in 1970, McCullough served in the United States Marine Corps, retiring as a colonel in the Marine Corps Reserves. McCullough worked as legislative counsel for New Mexico Senator Harrison Schmitt, as a counsel to the United States Senate, and finally as an Assistant United States Attorney in the eastern district of North Carolina from 1981 through 1996, when he left to enter private practice.

In November 2000, McCullough was elected to the North Carolina Court of Appeals with just over 50 percent of the vote, defeating incumbent Clarence Horton.

==Personal life==
He is married to Lucci McCullough and has two children. He resides in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina.

On October 7, 2006, McCullough was charged with drunk driving. He pleaded guilty to driving while impaired on April 3, 2007.

==Elections==
===2008 re-election campaign===
McCullough is a registered Republican, but in his 2008 bid for re-election, he cited bipartisan support from notables such as former NC Supreme Court Chief Justices Burley Mitchell (a Democrat) and I. Beverly Lake Jr. (a Republican). He also enjoyed support from former North Carolina Court of Appeals Judges S. Gerald Arnold, Sidney S. Eagles, K. Edward Greene, and Albert S. Thomas Jr.

McCullough was criticized in 2007 for implying that he and other incumbent Republican incumbents should be re-elected because they would favor Republicans in an anticipated lawsuit over redistricting. An ethics complaint was filed against him as a result of his comments.
In response to the complaint, the state Judicial Standards Commission said it would not punish McCullough, but it also said that it had made &quot;an effort to ensure such conduct is not repeated.&quot;

McCullough was defeated in the November 2008 election by state District Court judge Cheri Beasley.

===2010 election===
McCullough won a new term on the Court of Appeals in 2010, when he came in second in the first round, but won the second round, of the first use of instant runoff voting for a statewide election in North Carolina. He narrowly defeated appointed incumbent judge Cressie Thigpen.

<text>Robin Elizabeth Hudson (born February 20, 1952) is an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.

==Early life and education==
Born in DeKalb County, Georgia, after studying philosophy and psychology at Yale University, Hudson earned a J.D. degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976.

==Career==
Except for three years as a state appellate defender, Hudson worked in private practice in Raleigh and Durham, North Carolina until 2000, when she was elected to the North Carolina Court of Appeals—the first woman to be elected to an appellate court in North Carolina without being appointed first. She is married and has two children, Emily and Charles.

Hudson was elected to the North Carolina Supreme Court seat of retiring Justice George Wainwright in November 2006. She took office in January 2007. Hudson was re-elected to the Court in November 2014. She chose not to run for another term in 2022, as she would have reached the state&#x27;s mandatory retirement age about 13 months into that term.

In 2009, Hudson became president of the Women&#x27;s Forum of North Carolina.

Hudson wrote the Supreme Court&#x27;s 2022 opinion striking down the state legislature&#x27;s congressional and legislative districts as excessively partisan gerrymanders.

<doc id="1112328" wikidata="Q3777318" url="?curid=1112328" title="Todd Carty">
<text>Todd Carty, also known as Todd John Jennings (born Todd Robert Carty; 31 August 1963), is an actor and director who has grown up on television screens in a variety of roles. His stage appearances have ranged from serious drama to pantomime, and he has worked on radio plays, voiceovers, commercials, narrations and films. He is best known for TV roles as Tucker Jenkins in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; (1978–1982) and &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1983–1985), Mark Fowler in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1990–2003), and PC Gabriel Kent in &quot;The Bill&quot; (2003–2005).

==Early life==
Carty was born in Willesden, London, as Todd R. Carty to an unmarried Irish mother, Margaret M. Carty, from Limerick. In 1972 Margaret married Thomas Jennings, who later adopted Carty and legally changed his name to Todd John Jennings. Through his mother, Carty is a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland. He grew up in Kilburn, West Hampstead and Harrow on the Hill, London. He has two younger sisters named Billie Joe and Bobby Sue, who respectively work as a lawyer and a teacher. Carty was educated at the Phildene Stage School, a co-educational independent school in Chiswick in west London.

==Career==
===Early career===
Carty&#x27;s first television appearance in the UK was in an advertisement for Woolworths, aged four. He also had other advertising and Public Information Film roles, including one with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor Jon Pertwee for the Green Cross Code.

Carty made his first professional stage appearance at the New London Theatre, Drury Lane, London, as the young Lionel in Lionel Bart&#x27;s autobiographical musical &quot;Lionel!&quot;. However, his career in his youth was mostly defined by his television role as Tucker Jenkins in the BBC children&#x27;s drama &quot;Grange Hill&quot; (1978–1982) and the spin-off series &quot;Tucker&#x27;s Luck&quot; (1983–1985).

During the 1970s and 1980s, Carty also appeared in &quot;Z-Cars&quot; (1976), &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot;, &quot;Drummer&quot;, and &quot;Headmaster&quot;, all for the BBC; and, for German TV, &quot;Focus on Britain&quot; and &quot;The Idle Bunch&quot;. His film work included &quot;Please Sir!&quot; (1971) and &quot;Professor Popper&#x27;s Problem&quot; (1974). In 1983, he landed the role of Oswyn in the fantasy film &quot;Krull&quot; opposite Kenneth Marshall, Lysette Anthony, Liam Neeson and Alun Armstrong, among others.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;===
Carty took over the role of original character Mark Fowler in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1990, following the death of the original actor, David Scarboro. Carty played the role for 13 years, becoming one of the longer-running male cast members. In July 2002, the BBC announced Mark Fowler was being written out of the serial, a mutual decision between the producers and Carty. Executive producer Louise Berridge said Carty had made a &quot;fantastic contribution&quot; to the soap and Mark had been a &quot;pivotal figure&quot;, but the character had finally run its course: &quot;Todd and I have discussed this at some length and agreed that it was time for Mark to hang up his leather jacket for the last time. We will all miss Todd, who is one of our best-loved actors, and wish him every success in the future.&quot; Carty made his final appearance as Mark in February 2003, riding out of the Square on his motorbike. The character subsequently died off-screen in 2004.

After leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2003, Carty went on to play the villainous PC Gabriel Kent, in ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Bill&quot; from 2003 to 2005. Carty has since revealed he broke his &quot;EastEnders&quot; contract a year earlier than planned to take on this new role.

In 2019, Carty shared his memories of playing Gabriel in an interview for The Bill Podcast.

===Other television and film appearances===
Carty starred as Randy Candy in the film The Candy Show (1989). While still in &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1997, Carty appeared with former &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Nick Berry in the Victorian period adventure film The Black Velvet Band, a Spaghetti Western-style drama.

Carty was the subject of a This Is Your Life tribute in 2000. Guests included Wendy Richard, Norman Wisdom, Nick Berry, his girlfriend Dina Clarkin, sons James Carty and Thomas Carty, and his father-in-law, actor Tony Clarkin.

After leaving &quot;The Bill&quot; in 2005, Carty returned to the big screen as the aristocrat Harvey Van Bollingbroke in the film &quot;Treasure of Albion&quot; (2006). Carty acted in &quot;The School that Roared&quot; (2009) as the eccentric Mr Haig, and was also the second-unit director. He appeared as Mr Keller in the 2010 film &quot;Blame&quot;.

Carty has guest-starred as Ray Hallam in the Christmas special of the TV series &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, and in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Holby City&quot;, as villain Cameron Cooke. In 2008, he guest-starred in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctors&quot;, playing the part of Kev Blake.

In 2003, Carty reprised the role of Tucker Jenkins in &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, as the uncle of one of the pupils, Patrick &quot;Togger&quot; Johnson. He appeared in just this one episode, but he was brought back once again to film for &quot;Grange Hill&#x27;s&quot; final series, broadcast in 2008 – a one-off special episode to celebrate the 30th birthday of the long-running BBC show. Carty appeared as Tucker in the final televised episode of &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, screened on Monday 15 September 2008 on BBC One.

Carty was a guest on the BBC One show &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;, in May 2008, with Cameron Mackintosh, helping to choose one of the selected boys to play Oliver Twist for the new West End production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;.

Carty and his elder son, James, filmed together in a factual television series for Channel 5, &quot;Dangerous Adventures For Boys&quot;, based on the book written by Conn and Hal Iggulden, &quot;The Dangerous Book for Boys&quot;. James Carty, aged 11 at the time of broadcast, became the youngest person to drive a steam train across the North York Moors 18-mile line from Grosmont, North Yorkshire to Pickering, built in the 1830s.

In June 2014, Carty was a contestant on &quot;Celebrity MasterChef&quot;.

Carty appeared as Mike in the film &quot;Silver Birches&quot; in 2017.

===&quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===

Carty appeared in the fourth series of the UK version of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, which began on 11 January 2009. Carty partnered professional skater Susie Lipanova and was heavily criticised by the judging panel for his apparent lack of skating ability. In the weeks he and Lipanova competed, they finished bottom of the leaderboard for their first week, 9.5 for their next appearance in week three, and 7.5 and 8.5 for weeks four and five respectively. During the routine in week three, Carty lost control on the ice so badly that he ended up stumbling into the off-stage area, disappearing from public view, leaving Lipanova to complete the routine alone, returning just in time to complete his routine to the Beatles song Help. The public vote carried the couple through to the next round and was described as one of the funniest moments ever captured on television. He was finally eliminated in the 5th round.

He also competed with Alexandra Schauman in the ninth and final series of &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; until it returned in 2018, which was an &quot;All-Stars&quot; series.

In 1989, Carty reprised the role of Tucker in the musical stage version of the television series &quot;Grange Hill&quot;: &quot;Grange Hill: Tucker&#x27;s Return&quot;, at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre, Hornchurch. Between 2007 and 2008, he toured the UK in &quot;The Business of Murder&quot; as Police Detective Hallett. Todd Carty and Wendy Richard (who played his screen mother Pauline in &quot;EastEnders&quot;) presented &quot;50 Greatest Families&quot; on Sky One in March 2008.

Carty also appeared in a BBC Radio 4 Play of the day &quot;Bringing Eddie Home&quot; by John Peacock, based on a true story of the fight by East End couple Edna and Jack Wallace to get their son&#x27;s body brought home from Aden, and the ensuing fight for the rights of British Service service personnel. Carty played the role of the younger Jack Wallace and the play also included other ex-EastEnders actors Bill Treacher, Tilly Vosburgh, Edna Doré and Joe Absolom

<text>Sir John Yeamans, 1st Baronet (bapt. 28 February 1611 – 1674) was an English colonial administrator and planter who served as Governor of Carolina from 1672 to 1674. Contemporary descriptions of Yeamans described him as &quot;a pirate ashore.&quot;

==Life==
Baptised on 28 February 1611 in Bristol, England, Sir John Yeamans was a younger son of John Yeamans, a brewer of Redcliffe, Bristol who died about 1645, and his wife Blanche Germain. The younger Yeamans was a colonel in the Royalist army during the English Civil War.

In about 1650 Yeamans migrated to Barbados, and within a decade he had become a major landholder there (he had held land in Barbados since 1638) a colonel of the colonial militia, judge of a local court of common pleas, and by July 1660 he was serving on the Barbadian council.

==Carolina==
In the deteriorating economic conditions of the 1660s and 1670s many Barbadian planters sought better opportunities. In 1663 a number of planters in Barbados made arrangements with the proprietors of Carolina for establishing a colony at Cape Fear. The Lords Proprietors, by the exercise of their influence at the English court, secured a baronetcy for Yeamans, which was conferred on him 12 January 1665, and on 11 January 1665 they appointed him governor of the new colony, with a jurisdiction extending from Cape Fear to San Mateo.

The region was named Clarendon County. Yeamans was also instructed to explore the coast south of Cape Fear. He sailed with three vessels from Barbados in January 1665, and reached Cape Fear, but sustained heavy loss on the way from rough weather. Accordingly, he soon returned to Barbados, leaving the management of the new settlement to a deputy, Captain Robert Sandford (whose lieutenant was Joseph Woory, Yeamans&#x27;s nephew). However the colonists abandoned Clarendon by the autumn of 1667.

In 1669 another attempt at colonisation was made. Three ships of settlers were sent to Port Royal Island from the British Isles calling first at Barbados. Instructed by the proprietors to name a governor Yeamans named himself and joined the expedition until it reached Bermuda. In Bermuda he appointed the elderly William Sayle in his place and abruptly returned to Barbados. The expedition continued and successfully founded South Carolina&#x27;s first permanent English settlement in April 1670.

Sayle died in March 1671. Before his death he nominated as his successor the deputy governor, Joseph West, and this appointment was approved by the colonists. Yeamans arrived in the new colony in 1671 and was disappointed not to be made governor immediately, and used his position as speaker of the colonies first parliament to harass West. He also started to build a plantation into which he brought 200 African slaves.

On 21 August 1671 the proprietors, to the great dissatisfaction of the colonists, appointed Yeamans to the governorship. He was proclaimed Governor of the English Province of Carolina at Charles Town on 19 April 1672. Early in his governorship at the bequest of the proprietors he initiated a land survey for what would become Charles Town and expanded his plantation.

The colony during his governorship suffered from internal dissensions, and was threatened both by the Spaniards and the Indians. The proprietors found fault with Yeamans as extravagant and indifferent to their interests. The colonists objected to his profits as an exporter of food-stuffs from Barbados. In May 1674 the proprietors replaced Yeamans with his predecessor Joseph West, but Yeamans apparently died before he received the notice. The minutes of the colony&#x27;s Grand Council show that Yeamans presided as governor over a meeting on 3 August 1674, but minutes for the next meeting on 13 August 1674 report that Yeamans had died.

==Yeamans family==

Sir John Yeamans married twice: firstly to – Limp, with whom he had five sons, and secondly on 11 April 1661 to Margaret Berringer, they had four children (two sons and two daughters). It is likely that Yeamans had Benjamin Berringer, his former business partner and husband of Margaret, poisoned just weeks before the marriage. However the death was investigated and Yeamans was cleared by the council.

Yeamans&#x27; many descendants were still in prominent positions in West Indies affairs at the start of the 20th century. John&#x27;s younger brother, Robert, also received a baronetcy on 31 December 1666 but he left no children.

Yeamans&#x27; connection with the colony is still commemorated by the ancient mansion of Yeamans Hall, on Goose Creek, near Charleston. Sir John&#x27;s considerable wealth in Barbados passed to his son, Major Sir William Yeamans, second baronet, and great-grandfather of Sir John Yeamans of Barbados, whose son, Sir Robert (d. 19 February 1788), was the last baronet.

Lieutenant Colonel Josiah Martin, the last colonial governor of the Province of North Carolina was a member of the same West Indies Yeamans family.

Yeamans was one of a large, often prominent, family named Yeamans or Yeomans of Bristol, England some of whom later became Quakers. One prominent member of the family was Robert Yeamans a sheriff of Bristol. In 1643 he plotted to seize a city gate and let in a Royalist army to overwhelm the Parliamentary garrison. The plot was discovered and he along with some fellow conspirators were executed by the Parliamentary military governor for treason. Robert Yeamans was not a close relation of Sir John.

<text>Milan–San Remo (in Italian &quot;Milano-Sanremo&quot;), also called &quot;&quot;The Spring classic&quot; or &quot;La Classicissima&quot;&quot;, is an annual road cycling race between Milan and Sanremo, in Northwest Italy. With a distance of , it is the longest professional one-day race in modern cycling. It is the first major classic race of the season, usually held on the third Saturday of March. The first edition was held in 1907.

It is traditionally the first of the five &quot;Monuments&quot; of the season, considered to be one of the most prestigious one-day events in cycling. It was the opening race of the UCI Road World Cup series until the series was replaced by the UCI ProTour in 2005 and the World Tour in 2011.

The most successful rider with seven victories is Belgian Eddy Merckx. Italian Costante Girardengo achieved 11 podium finishes in the interwar period, winning the race six times. In modern times, German Erik Zabel and Spaniard Óscar Freire have recorded four and three wins respectively.

Milan–San Remo is considered a &quot;sprinters classic&quot; because of its mainly flat course (although the Poggio climb close to the finish has often been an opportunity for puncheurs and rouleurs), whereas the other Italian Monument race, the Giro di Lombardia, held in autumn, is considered a &quot;climbers classic&quot;.

From 1999 to 2005, a women&#x27;s race, the Primavera Rosa, was organized alongside the men&#x27;s but at a shorter distance. From 2025, a women&#x27;s race will be held as part of the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour.

==History==

===The pioneering days===
The idea of a bike race between Milan and Sanremo originated from the &quot;Unione Sportiva Sanremese&quot;. A first amateur race was held on 2 and 3 April 1906 over two stages (Milan–Acqui Terme and Acqui Terme–Sanremo); albeit with little success. Milanese journalist Tullo Morgagni, who had launched the Tour of Lombardy in 1905, put forth the idea of organizing a professional cycling race in a single day over the course. He proposed the project to Eugenio Costamagna, the director of the popular sports newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport, who took on the organization.
On 14 April 1907 the first official edition of Milan–San Remo was held. The start was at the Conca Fallata inn of Milan at 5 a.m. Sixty riders registered, but only 33 took the start. The inaugural contest was especially hard as it was affected by exceptionally cold weather. It was won by Frenchman Lucien Petit-Breton, who completed the 286 kilometers (177 miles) in an average speed of 26.206 km/h (16.5 mph). Only 14 riders finished.

The race was a commercial success and attracted some of the best riders of European cycling, prompting the Gazzetta dello Sport to organize a second edition in 1908, won by Belgium&#x27;s Cyrille Van Hauwaert. The first Italian winner of Milan–San Remo was Luigi Ganna who won in 1909 by an hour over Frenchman Emile Georget.

In 1910 the &quot;Primavera&quot; gained eternal fame and a place in cycling legend because of the extreme weather conditions. Riders needed to take refuge in the houses along the roads because a severe snowstorm scourged the peloton. Just four out of 63 riders finished the race. Frenchman Eugène Christophe won, even though he thought he had taken a wrong road and did not realize he was the first to reach Sanremo. Christophe finished the race in 12 hours and 24 minutes, making it the slowest edition ever. Giovanni Cocchi finished second at 1h 17 minutes from the winner.

===La Classicissima===

After the pioneering days of the race, began the era of Costante Girardengo, who connected his name indelibly to the classic. From 1917 to 1928 Girardengo had a record 11 podium finishes, six times as winner. Subsequent years were marked by the rivalry between Learco Guerra and Alfredo Binda, whose emulation caused them to lose several certain victories. A similar rivalry was the one in the 1940s with the mythical years of Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali, whose duels were the subject of intense coverage and resulted in epic races.

Milan–San Remo was at the peak of its popularity and the Italian press started to coin the untranslatable term &quot;La Classicissima&quot;, the greatest of all classics. From 1935 to 1953 the race was run every year on 19 March, the feast of patron Saint Joseph, hence the press in predominantly Catholic Italy gave it its other nickname, &quot;la Gara di San Giuseppe &quot;(&quot;Saint Joseph&#x27;s Race&quot;). In 1949 the race finished for the first time on the iconic Via Roma, a busy shopping street in the heart of Sanremo.

As from the 1950s the race was mainly won by Belgian and Spanish sprinters, and after 1953, Italian riders could not seal a victory for 17 years. In 1960 race director Vincenzo Torriani added the climb of the Poggio, just before the arrival in Sanremo. The intent was to make the race finale harder, but the decision did not have the aspired effect and the streak of non-Italian victories continued.

In 1966 began the legendary era of Eddy Merckx, who achieved an unsurpassed record of seven victories. Seven wins is also the record number of victories by a rider in a single classic to date. After the &quot;Cannibal&quot;&#x27;s streak no rider could dominate Milan–San Remo again until 1997, when German Erik Zabel began a series of four victories and two second places.

===The Sprinters Classic===

In 1990 Italian Gianni Bugno set a race record of 6h 25 m 06 seconds to win by 4 seconds over Rolf Gölz, averaging 45.8 kmh (28.45 mph). Another memorable running was the one in 1992, when Seán Kelly caught Moreno Argentin in the descent of the Poggio and beat the Italian in a two-man sprint. It was Kelly&#x27;s penultimate career win. In between Erik Zabel&#x27;s wins, Andrei Tchmil won the 1999 contest, after he launched a decisive attack under the one-kilometer banner and narrowly stayed ahead of the sprinting peloton, with Zabel coming in second place.

In 2004 Zabel could have won a fifth time, but lost to Óscar Freire only because he lifted his arms to celebrate and stopped pedalling too early. Freire would go on to secure a total of three &quot;Primavera&quot; wins in later years. In 2008 the finish was moved to a different location for the first time in 59 years, due to road works on the Via Roma. Swiss Fabian Cancellara was the first winner on the Lungomare Italo Calvino, after an ultimate solo attack in the streets of San Remo.

In 2009 the 100th edition of Milan–San Remo was held, won by British sprinter Mark Cavendish on his first attempt. Cavendish beat Australian Heinrich Haussler in a &quot;millimeter sprint&quot;.
The race of 2013 was affected by abysmal weather conditions from start to finish. Heavy snowfall and below-zero temperatures forced organizers to shorten the race by 52 kilometres (32 miles) eliminating two key climbs – the Passo del Turchino and Le Manie – and arranging a bus transfer for the race to begin a second time. The race was won by German Gerald Ciolek who outsprinted Peter Sagan and Fabian Cancellara.

In 2015 race director Mauro Vegni decided to move the finish back to the Via Roma after seven years on the seaside, stating the change would be for 2015 and beyond. German John Degenkolb won the race ahead of previous winner Alexander Kristoff. The 2016 race was won by French sprinter Arnaud Démare in a bunch sprint, but Démare was accused after the race of having used the tow of his teamcar to rejoin the pack on the Cipressa climb. Démare rebuffed these allegations, stating that the race commissioners were right behind him and would have disqualified him had he done something illegal.

In 2017 Michał Kwiatkowski became the first Polish winner of a monument in a three-up sprint finish with world champion Peter Sagan and Julian Alaphilippe after the trio broke clear on the race&#x27;s final climb – the Poggio di San Remo.

The 2020 edition was forced to move to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, making it the first ever summer edition of the &quot;Spring classic&quot;. The edition was won by Belgian Wout van Aert.

In May 2022 RCS Sport announced a plan to organize a women’s edition from 2023. 
In 2024, the race underwent notable route changes, notably featuring a new start destination in Pavia, located just outside of Milan.

From 2025, a women&#x27;s race will be held as part of the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour over a shorter distance on the same day as the men&#x27;s race.

==Route==

===Present course===

Upon its inception, Milan–San Remo was conceived as a straightforward line from Milan, the industrial heart of Northern Italy, to San Remo, the fashionable seaside resort on the Italian Riviera with its trademark Belle Epoque villas. The race starts on the Piazza del Duomo in the heart of Milan and immediately heads to the southwest, over the plains of Lombardy and Piedmont, along the cities of Pavia, Voghera, Tortona, Novi Ligure and Ovada. As the race enters Liguria, the peloton addresses the Passo del Turchino, the first climb of the day, after 140 km.

After the descent of the Turchino the race reaches the Ligurian Sea in Voltri at halfway point. From here the course follows the Aurelia highway to the west, with its spectacular and typical scenery along the Ligurian Coast. The race crosses the towns of Arenzano, Varazze, Savona, Finale Ligure, Pietra Ligure, Loano, Borghetto Santo Spirito, Ceriale and Albenga, followed by the seaside resorts along the Riviera dei Fiori (Alassio, Andora, Diano Marina and Imperia). Between Alassio and Imperia, three short hills along the coast are included: the Capo Mele, Capo Cervo and Capo Berta. In San Lorenzo al Mare the course turns inwards to the Cipressa, the next climb, with its top at 22 km from the finish. After the towns of Santo Stefano al Mare and Arma di Taggia comes the last and most famous climb, the Poggio di Sanremo, in fact a suburb of Sanremo, built upon a hill along the sea.

From the top of the Poggio, 5.4 km from the finish, the course heads down via a fast and curvy descent towards the center of Sanremo, where the race traditionally finishes on the Via Roma, the city&#x27;s illustrious shopping street.

===Race characteristics===
Being the longest professional one-day race, Milan–San Remo is an unusual test of endurance early in the season. It is often won not by the fastest sprinter, but by the strongest and best prepared rider with a strong sprint finish. The Cipressa and Poggio have foiled many sprinters who could not stay with the front group.
In the early years the only significant difficulty was the Passo del Turchino, which was often a pivotal site of the race – but when cycling became more professional, the climb was not demanding enough and too far from the finish to be decisive. In 1960 the Poggio, a 4 km climb just a few kilometres before the finish, was introduced. In 1982 the Cipressa, near Imperia, was added. The other hills are the Capo Mele, Capo Cervo and Capo Berta. From 2008 to 2014 the organizers added the climb of Le Manie as well, between the Turchino and the &quot;Capi&quot;. The Turchino and Le Manie are longer climbs, meant to cause a first selection in the peloton, while the Capi, Cipressa and Poggio are rather short, inviting attackers to distance the peloton.

In recent years there has rarely been a big selection in the latter stages of the race. Many sprinters are able to keep up with the main peloton on the climbs, and therefore the race most often ends in a group sprint. Nonetheless, the location of the Poggio close to the finish has often meant that riders&#x27; position on top of the Poggio is crucial in order to win the race.

Despite its flat course and long finishing straight, sprinters&#x27; teams have been foiled from time to time by a determined attack on the last hills. Good examples include Laurent Jalabert and Maurizio Fondriest escaping in 1995 and staying ahead to the finish. In 2003, Paolo Bettini attacked with Luca Paolini and Mirko Celestino to stay ahead. In 2012, Vincenzo Nibali and Fabian Cancellara attacked on the Poggio, followed by Australian Simon Gerrans, who outsprinted them at the finish. In 2018, Nibali attacked on the final bends of the Poggio, resisting the return of the group to win by a small margin.

===Proposed changes===
Milan–San Remo has had few significant course changes since its first edition, and organizers have made it a matter of honour to stay true to the original intent.
The last change to the course was the inclusion of Le Manie, in 2008. In September 2013, organiser RCS Sport announced the race would include the Pompeiana climb between the Cipressa and Poggio. To keep the race at a reasonable distance, it would exclude Le Manie. The Pompeiana, named after the village the road passes, climbs five kilometres with a 13% maximum gradient, and would therefore be the most difficult climb in the race finale.

The proposed route was reversed just weeks before the race in March 2014, when the Pompeiana had been damaged by recent landslides, making it too dangerous for a cycling race to pass. Hence the race was re-routed and made more traditional and sprinter-friendly. This led to a number of sprinters, who had earlier ruled themselves out due to the addition of the extra climb, including Mark Cavendish, declaring their interest in riding again.

In 2015, the climb of Le Manie was cut from the race, and neither was the Pompeiana included in the trajectory. With this pre-2008 route, race organizers stated they want to respect the race&#x27;s traditional course.
In 2023, the start of the race moved to Abbiategrasso. In 2024, the race underwent notable route changes, notably featuring a new start destination in Pavia, located just outside of Milan.

===2020 edition===

The 2020 edition, already extraordinary in being held in the midst of summer, followed an new route. This was due to the extraordinary conditions determined first by the pandemics, and then by the sudden refusal, just a few weeks before the race, by the mayors of several seaside town to let the race pass through the coastal highway, or &quot;Via Aurelia&quot;, heavily engaged by tourist traffic in August whereas it is much less suffocated by it in March, the usual racing time. The race ended up being 306 km long, with a heavy detour through the Langhe hills and the Tanaro river valley before reaching the western Ligurian coast through the Col di Nava pass and the Colle San Bartolomeo tunnel, only reaching the usual route at Imperia.

===Wins per country===
==Women&#x27;s race==

From 1999 to 2005 seven editions of Milan–San Remo for women were held. The race was organized on the same day and finished in Sanremo shortly before the men, but covered a shorter distance. The start was not in Milan, but in Varazze, hence it was named Primavera Rosa. It was part of the UCI Women&#x27;s Road World Cup. The 2006 edition was initially planned but cancelled before the event. Russian Zoulfia Zabirova was the only rider to win twice.

In 2023, RCS Sport announced that a women&#x27;s edition of the race would be held from 2024. It is unclear whether the race will use the Primavera Rosa name.

==Granfondo Milano-Sanremo==
The Granfondo Milano-Sanremo is an annual cyclosportive event for recreational cyclists over the same course as the professional race from Milan to San Remo. It is one of the oldest &quot;Granfondos&quot; in Italy, founded in 1971 by the &quot;Unione Cicloturistica Sanremo&quot; and popular among cyclotourists from all over the world. It is currently held the second Sunday in June and 2021 (postponed from 2020) was its 50th edition.

==In popular culture==
* The race features in the 1980 Italian comedy film &quot;Fantozzi contro tutti&quot;.
* The 1910 race is the subject of the 2006 graphic novel &quot;La Primavera&quot; by Alexis Frederick-Frost.

<text>Arioch () appears in Genesis 14 as the name of the King of Ellassr () who participated in the Battle of Siddim. Led by Chedorlaomer, the four kings Amraphel, Arioch, Chedorlaomer, and Tidal engaged in a punitive expedition against five kings of Canaan who rebelled against Chedorlaomer, Bera of Sodom, Birsha of Gomorrah, Shinab of Admah, Shemeber of Zeboim, and Zoar of Bela. The same story is also mentioned in the Book of Jubilees, where Arioch is called &quot;king of Sellasar&quot;. According to Genesis Apocryphon (col. 21), Arioh was king of Cappadocia.

== Arioch and Ellasar ==
Some historians have placed the area where Arioch ruled in Anatolia, but theories as to its specific locations differ, with some claiming it was in Pontus while others cite Cappadocia and Antioch. 

There are also sources which associated Ellasar with the kingdom of Larsa and suggested that Arioch could be one of its kings called &quot;Eri-Aku&quot;, an epithet of either Warad-Sin or Rim-Sîn I, since both are described as son of Kudur-Mabuk. 

By the 20th century, this theory became popular so that it was common to identify Arioch with &quot;Eriaku&quot; through the alternative reading of either Rim-Sîn or his brother Warad-Sin, who were both believed to be contemporary with Hammurabi. 

Others identify Ellasar with Ilānṣurā, which is a city known from the second millennium BC Mari archives in the vicinity of the north of Mari, Syria, and Arioch with Arriuk, who appears in the Mari archives as a subordinate of Zimri-Lim. The identification of Arioch with the ruler Arriuk mentioned in the Mari archives has been recently supported by the Assyrologists Jean-Marie Durand and Stephanie Dalley.

Some modern scholars consider Arioch as a literary figure, not a historical figure, but in the case of Ellasar, they connect it to the name Alashiya, not Larsa or Cappadocia. Ellasar is related to the name of Elishah in Genesis 10:4, which is why it is presumed to have referred to Alashiya, an ancient kingdom on Cyprus. The name Arioch could be originated from the foreigner or foreign story that Jewish people learnt from the foreign diaspora community, which included Elamites and many other foreigners, as mentioned in Ezra 4.

==Adaptations by later writers==
Arioch was a name for a fictional demon, and also appears as the name of a demon in many grimoires. Arioch is also named in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (vi. 371.) as one of the fallen angels under Satan&#x27;s command.

Arioch is one of the principal lords of Chaos in several of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s fantasy series.

Arioch is one of the seventeen megatherians mentioned in Gene Wolfe&#x27;s Briah Cycle.

<text>The CN-105-57, also known as CN 105/57 or D1504, is a light French 105 mm tank gun.

== Design ==
The CN 105-57 is a light 105 mm rifled tank gun originally designed to be mounted on light tanks with oscillating turret such as the French AMX-13 and the Austrian SK-105 Kurassier. 
It uses the same conventional ammunition as the longer and heavier CN 105 F1 but smaller and lighter propellant charges with shorter cartridges cases enable it to be fitted into the FL 12, FL 15 and FL 20 light tanks oscillating turrets.
Other changes to the gun include a horizontal breechblock, a muzzle brake, and a single-cylinder recoil mechanism together with a single hydropneumatic recuperator.

The 105 mm L44/57 FTR gun produced in Argentinema at the Fábrica Militar «Río Tercero» (FM «RT»), Río Tercero, Córdoba, which was a copy of the French CN-105-57 gun.
== Ammunition ==
*OCC 105 F1 : a 10.85 kg non-rotating shaped-charge round with a muzzle velocity of 800 m/s.
*OE 105 : a 12.1 kg high-explosive shell with a muzzle velocity of 700 m/s.
*OECL 105 : a 11.7 kg illuminating round with a muzzle velocity of 295 m/s.
*OFUM 105 : a 12.8 kg smoke shell with a muzzle velocity of 695 m/s.
*OFL 105 G1 : a 3.41 kg APFSDS using the same 1.8 kg penetrator as the 105 mm OFL 105 F3, it has a muzzle velocity of 1430–1475 m/s and penetrates 120 mm of RHA steel at impact angle of 67° at 1000 m..
*105 MM MLE 57 APFSDS-T : an Austrian APFSDS designed by Hirtenberger Defense Systems of Austria, it has a muzzle velocity of 1410 m/s and penetrates 250 mm of RHA steel at impact angle of 30° at 1000 m.

== CN 105 G1 ==
The Giat Industries 105 mm G1 is a further development of the 105 mm CN 105/57 which is installed in the French FL 12, FL 15 and FL 20 oscillating turrets.
The modification enables the weapon to fire the 105 mm OFL 105 G1 APFSDS ammunition. The ordnance is fitted with a new single baffle muzzle brake, a thermal sleeve, a fume extractor and semi-automatic horizontal breech mechanism.

<text>Allen Edward Hatcher (born October 23, 1944) is an American topologist.

==Biography==
Hatcher was born in Indianapolis, Indiana. After obtaining his B.A. and B.Mus. from Oberlin College in 1966, he went for his graduate studies to Stanford University, where he received his Ph.D. in 1971. His thesis, &quot;A K2 Obstruction for Pseudo-Isotopies&quot;, was written under the supervision of Hans Samelson.

Afterwards, Hatcher went to Princeton University, where he was an NSF postdoc for a year, then a lecturer for another year, and then Assistant Professor from 1973 to 1979. He was also a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in 1975–76 and 1979–80. Hatcher moved to the University of California, Los Angeles as an assistant professor in 1977. From 1983 he has been a professor at Cornell University; he is now a professor emeritus.

In 1978 Hatcher was an invited speaker at the International Congresses of Mathematicians in Helsinki.

==Mathematical contributions==
He has worked in geometric topology, both in high dimensions, relating pseudoisotopy to algebraic K-theory, and in low dimensions: surfaces and 3-manifolds, such as proving the Smale conjecture for the 3-sphere.

===3-manifolds===
Perhaps among his most recognized results in 3-manifolds concern the classification of incompressible surfaces in certain 3-manifolds and their boundary slopes. William Floyd and Hatcher classified all the incompressible surfaces in punctured-torus bundles over the circle. William Thurston and Hatcher classified the incompressible surfaces in 2-bridge knot complements. As corollaries, this gave more examples of non-Haken, non-Seifert fibered, irreducible 3-manifolds and extended the techniques and line of investigation started in Thurston&#x27;s Princeton lecture notes. Hatcher also showed that irreducible, boundary-irreducible 3-manifolds with toral boundary have at most &quot;half&quot; of all possible boundary slopes resulting from essential surfaces. In the case of one torus boundary, one can conclude that the number of slopes given by essential surfaces is finite.

Hatcher has made contributions to the so-called theory of essential laminations in 3-manifolds. He invented the notion of &quot;end-incompressibility&quot; and several of his students, such as Mark Brittenham, Charles Delman, and Rachel Roberts, have made important contributions to the theory.

===Surfaces===
Hatcher and Thurston exhibited an algorithm to produce a presentation of the mapping class group of a closed, orientable surface. Their work relied on the notion of a cut system and moves that relate any two systems.

<text>Berengar, called the Wise (, ), was the duke or count of Toulouse (814–835) and duke (or margrave) of Septimania (832–835). He held the County of Barcelona concomitantly with Septimania. 

Berengar was a member of the family of the Unrochids. He was the son of Unruoch II of Friuli and Ingeltrude and brother of Eberhard. His nephew was the Holy Roman Emperor Berengar. 

In 814, Louis the Pious installed Berengar as Count of Toulouse in succession to Raymond Raphinel who had been appointed by Charlemagne. He was also a councillor of Pepin I of Aquitaine in 816. In 819, he and Guerin, Count of Auvergne, fought against the usurping Duke of Gascony, Lupo III Centule. Berengar appears as a &quot;missus dominicus&quot; of Louis in May 825 and then in 827 in the six counties of Rheims, Soissons, Senlis, Beauvais, Laon, and &quot;Catolonis&quot; and the four bishoprics of Amiens, Cambrai, Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise, and &quot;Noviomacensem&quot;. 

In November 831, Pepin revolted against his father, with Berengar advising him not to rebel, but with Bernard of Septimania inciting him. In the beginning of 832, Louis the Pious began campaigning against his rebellious son. Berengar, loyal to the Emperor, attacked the domains of Bernard, taking Roussillon (with Vallespir), Razès, and Conflent. On 2 February, Berengar had already reached Elna. Finally, in the autumn of the same year, successive victories by the imperial forces compelled Pepin and Bernard to appear before the Emperor (October) to plead for peace. Pepin was dispossessed of his kingdom and sent, as a prisoner, to Trier. His territories were given to Charles the Bald, youngest son of the Emperor. Bernard was accused of infidelity and dispossessed of all his lands in Septimania and Gothia; they were given to Berengar. Gaucelm, Bernard&#x27;s brother, was also dispossessed of the majority of his lands, but for a time kept the Empúries although this too was lost to Berengar later. 

In 833, Aznar I Galíndez, Count of Urgell and Cerdanya, usurped the counties of Pallars and Ribagorza from under Berengar&#x27;s rule. In 834, when another rebellious son of the emperor, Lothair, was defeated, Bernard, having fought on the side of Louis with Pepin, reclaimed his old domains as the price of his support. The lands were passed to Bernard and Berengar was weakened. As a result Berengar&#x27;s Pyrenean lands were confiscated unlawfully and redistributed by the imperial crown to others. His Catalan grants were taken away and given to his old enemy. He was left with nothing but the County of Toulouse after fighting loyally for the old emperor and the successful Pepin. 

In June 835, Bernard and Berengar were summoned to an Assembly at Crémieu, near Lyon, where a decision would be made about the distribution of lands in Septimania and Gothia, but on the way Berengar died unexpectedly. Thus the decision was simplified, and the Emperor gave the region&#x27;s counties to Bernard and Toulouse to Guerin.

<doc id="1112379" wikidata="Q7893395" url="?curid=1112379" title="United States v. Miller">
<text>United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), was a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that involved a Second Amendment to the United States Constitution challenge to the National Firearms Act of 1934 (NFA). The case is often cited in the ongoing American gun politics debate, as both sides claim that it supports their position.

==Background==
The case involved a criminal prosecution under the 1934 National Firearms Act (NFA). Passed in response to public outcry over the St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, the NFA requires certain types of firearms, such as fully automatic firearms and short-barrelled rifles and shotguns, to be registered with the Miscellaneous Tax Unit, which was later folded into what eventually became the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), then part of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, the ancestor of today&#x27;s Internal Revenue Service. The $200 tax was to be paid at the time of registration and again if the firearm was ever sold.

The defendants Jack Miller and Frank Layton were indicted on charges of unlawfully and feloniously transporting in interstate commerce from Oklahoma to Arkansas an unregistered double-barrel 12-gauge shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, in violation of the National Firearms Act, 26 U.S.C.S. § 1132c et seq. (&quot;Act&quot;). At trial in federal district court, the defendants filed a demurrer to the indictment alleging that the Act was not a revenue measure but an attempt to usurp police power reserved to the states and so was unconstitutional. Defendants further argued that the Act violated the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution. The district court held that the section of the Act that made it unlawful to transport an unregistered firearm in interstate commerce was unconstitutional as violative of the Second Amendment. It accordingly sustained the demurrer and quashed the indictment. The government took a direct appeal to the Supreme Court.

In reality, the district court judge, Heartsill Ragon, was in favor of the gun control law and ruled the law unconstitutional because he knew that Miller, who was a known bank robber and had just testified against the rest of his gang in court, would have to go into hiding as soon as he was released. He knew that Miller would not pay a lawyer to argue the case at the Supreme Court and would simply disappear. Therefore, the government&#x27;s appeal to the Supreme Court would surely be a victory because Miller and his attorney would not even be present at the argument.

On March 30, 1939, the Supreme Court heard the case. Attorneys for the United States argued four points:
#The NFA is intended as a revenue-collecting measure and so is within the authority of the Department of the Treasury.
#The defendants transported the shotgun from Oklahoma to Arkansas and so used it in interstate commerce.
#The Second Amendment protects only the ownership of military-type weapons appropriate for use in an organized militia.
#The &quot;double barrel 12-gauge Stevens shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length, bearing identification number 76230,&quot; was never used in any militia organization.

Neither the defendants nor their legal counsel appeared at the Supreme Court. A lack of financial support and procedural irregularities prevented counsel from traveling.

Miller was found shot to death in April, before the decision had been rendered.

==Decision==
On May 15, 1939, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice McReynolds, decided on the National Firearms Act, as applied to one indicted for transporting in interstate commerce a 12-gauge shotgun with a barrel less than 18 inches long without having registered it and without having in his possession a stamp-affixed written order for it, as required by the Act: 
# Not unconstitutional as an invasion of the reserved powers of the States. Citing Sonzinsky v. United States, 300 U. S. 506, and Narcotic Act cases. P. 307 U. S. 177. The conclusion was in the favor of the NFA.
# Not violative of the Second Amendment of the Federal Constitution. P. 307 U. S. 178.
The Court cannot take judicial notice that a shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches long has today any reasonable relation to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, and therefore cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees to the citizen the right to keep and bear such a weapon.

In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a &quot;shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length&quot; at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment, or that its use could contribute to the common defense.

In addition, Justice McReynolds wrote:
With obvious purpose to assure the continuation and render possible the effectiveness of such forces the declaration and guarantee of the Second Amendment were made. It must be interpreted and applied with that end in view.

==Interpretations==
Gun control advocates argue that the United States Circuit Courts, with very few exceptions, have for over six decades cited &quot;Miller&quot; in rejecting challenges to federal firearms regulations.

Gun rights advocates claim the case as a victory because they interpret it as stating that ownership of weapons for efficiency or the preservation of a well-regulated militia unit is specifically protected. Furthermore, they frequently point out that short-barreled shotguns (with 20-inch barrels) have been commonly used in warfare and that the statement made by the judges indicates that they were not made aware of this fact. Because the defense did not appear, there was arguably no way for judges to know otherwise. Two of the justices involved in the decision had prior military experience, Justice Black as a captain in the field artillery during World War I and Justice Frankfurter as a major in the Army legal service; however, there is no way to know if they were personally aware of the use of shotguns by American troops. During World War I, between 30,000 and 40,000 short-barreled pump-action shotguns were purchased by the US Ordnance Department and saw service in the trenches and for guarding German prisoners.

Some argue that fundamental issues related to the case were never truly decided because the Supreme Court remanded the case to the federal district court for &quot;further proceedings&quot;, which never took place. By the time of the Supreme Court decision, Miller had been killed, and since Layton made a plea bargain after the decision was handed down, there were no claimants left to continue legal proceedings.

The US Supreme Court has mentioned &quot;Miller&quot; in only seven subsequent cases: &quot;Konigsberg&quot; (1961); &quot;Atlanta Motel&quot; (1964); &quot;Adams&quot; (1972); &quot;Lewis&quot; (1980); &quot;Printz&quot; (1997); &quot;Heller&quot; (2008) and &quot;McDonald v. City of Chicago&quot; (2010); Justice James Clark McReynolds authored the decision in &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;, the only Supreme Court case that directly involved the Second Amendment until &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot; in 2008.

Here are the Supreme Court&#x27;s interpretations of the 1939 &quot;Miller&quot; opinion:

;&quot;Konigsberg v. State Bar&quot; (1961); Footnote 10
:That view, which of course cannot be reconciled with the law relating to libel, slander, misrepresentation, obscenity, perjury, false advertising, solicitation of crime, complicity by encouragement, conspiracy, and the like, is said to be compelled by the fact that the commands of the First Amendment are stated in unqualified terms: &quot;Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble&quot;. But as Mr. Justice Holmes once said: &quot;[T]he provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form; they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil. Their significance is vital not formal; it is to be gathered not simply by taking the words and a dictionary, but by considering their origin and the line of their growth.&quot; &quot;Gompers v. United States&quot;, 233 U.S. 604, 610. However, compare the qualified language of the Second Amendment: &quot;A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.&quot; And see &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;, 307 U.S. 174.
;&quot;Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States&quot; (1964); (concurring opinion of Black; Footnote 11): &quot;... cases in which the commerce power has been used to advance other ends not entirely commercial: e. g., ... &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;, 307 U.S. 174 (National Firearms Act); 
;&quot;Adams v. Williams&quot; (1972); (dissenting opinion of Douglas, joined by Marshall)
:The leading case is &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;, 307 U.S. 174, upholding a federal law making criminal the shipment in interstate commerce of a sawed-off shotgun. The law was upheld, there being no evidence that a sawed-off shotgun had &quot;some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia&quot;. Id., at 178. The Second Amendment, it was held, &quot;must be interpreted and applied&quot; with the view of maintaining a &quot;militia&quot;. 
:Critics say that proposals like this water down the Second Amendment. Our decisions belie that argument, for the Second Amendment, as noted, was designed to keep alive the militia.
;&quot;Lewis v. United States&quot; (1980); Footnote 8
:(the Second Amendment guarantees no right to keep and bear a firearm that does not have &quot;some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia&quot;); &quot;United States v. Three Winchester 30-30 Caliber Lever Action Carbines&quot;, 504 F.2d 1288, 1290, n. 5 (CA7 1974); &quot;United States v. Johnson&quot;, 497 F.2d 548 (CA4 1974); &quot;Cody v. United States&quot;, 460 F.2d 34 (CA8), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1010 (1972) (the latter three cases holding, respectively, that 1202 (a) (1), 922 (g), and 922 (a) (6) do not violate the Second Amendment). 
;&quot;Printz v. United States&quot; (1997) (concurring opinion of Thomas)
:Our most recent treatment of the Second Amendment occurred in &quot;United States v. Miller&quot;, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), in which we reversed the District Court&#x27;s invalidation of the National Firearms Act, enacted in 1934. In &quot;Miller&quot;, we determined that the Second Amendment did not guarantee a citizen&#x27;s right to possess a sawed off shotgun because that weapon had not been shown to be &quot;ordinary military equipment&quot; that could &quot;contribute to the common defense&quot;. Id., at 178. The Court did not, however, attempt to define, or otherwise construe, the substantive right protected by the Second Amendment.

<text>Arthur Wilson &quot;Bob&quot; Tucker (November 23, 1914 – October 6, 2006) was an American author who became well known as a writer of mystery, action adventure, and science fiction under the name Wilson Tucker.

Tucker was also a prominent member of science fiction fandom, who wrote extensively for fanzines under the name Bob Tucker, a family nickname bestowed in childhood (his own mispronunciation of the nickname &quot;Bub&quot;). He became a prominent analyst and critic of the field, as well as the coiner of such terms as &quot;space opera&quot;.

== Life ==

Born in Deer Creek, Illinois, for most of his life Tucker made his home in Bloomington, Illinois. He was married twice. In 1937, he wed Mary Joesting; they had a son and a daughter before the marriage dissolved in 1942. His second marriage, to Fern Delores Brooks in 1953, lasted 52 years, until her death in 2006; they had three sons.

== Fandom ==

Tucker became involved in science fiction fandom in 1932, publishing a fanzine, &quot;The Planetoid&quot;. From 1938 to 2001, he published the fanzine &quot;Le Zombie,&quot; which lasted for more than 60 issues and was later revived as a webzine. (The title arising from the fact that on multiple occasions fallacious reports of his death were made within fandom.)

He also published the &quot;Bloomington News Letter,&quot; which dealt with news within the professional science fiction writing field. Active in letter-writing as well, Tucker was a popular fan during more than six decades, coining many words and phrases familiar in science fiction fandom and to literary criticism of the field. In addition to &quot;Bob Tucker&quot;, he was also known to write under the pseudonym &quot;Hoy Ping Pong&quot; (generally reserved for humorous pieces.) During a 41-year period, 1955 to 1996, Tucker created and edited eight separate editions of &quot;The Neo-Fan&#x27;s Guide To Science Fiction Fandom&quot;, an historical overview of the first five decades of science fiction fandom, with important events and trends in fandom noted. Each edition also carried a lexicon of fan terminology in use throughout fandom at the time. The eighth and final edition remains in print from the Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society.

Tucker&#x27;s fanzine writing has been described as &quot;unfailingly incisive&quot;, and Tucker as &quot;the most intelligent and articulate and sophisticated fan the American science-fiction community is ever likely to boast of&quot;. He helped pioneer criticism of the genre, coining along the way terms like &quot;space opera&quot; in common use today.

He was fan guest of honor, professional guest of honor, toastmaster, or master of ceremonies at so many science fiction conventions over nearly seven decades that no one has managed to compile a comprehensive list. Notable are his appearances as guest of honor at Torcon I (the 1948 Worldcon) and NyCon3 (the 1967 Worldcon), a perennial stint as toastmaster of the long-running Midwestcon and LibertyCon, and as toastmaster at MidAmeriCon, the 1976 Worldcon.

In 1940, he served on the committee of the Worldcon in Chicago. In 2001, he co-hosted the joint Ditto/FanHistoriCon held in his hometown of Bloomington, Illinois.

Tucker won the Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer in 1970 and the 1954 Retro-Hugo for the same category in 2004. His &quot;Science Fiction Newsletter&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Bloomington News Letter&quot;) won the Retro-Hugo Award for Best Fanzine for 1951. His fanzine &quot;Le Zombie&quot; also won the 1943 Retro Hugo for Best Fanzine at Worldcon 76 in San Jose, CA.

The Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame inducted Tucker in 2003, its eighth class of two deceased and two living writers.
Other honors included the 1986 Skylark (annual Edward E. Smith Memorial Award for Imaginative Fiction), the 1996 Author Emeritus of the Science Fiction Writers of America, and the First Fandom Hall of Fame Award.

Tuckercon, the 2007 NASFiC (North American Science Fiction Convention) in Collinsville, Illinois, was dedicated to Tucker.

== Career ==

Although he sold more than 20 novels, Tucker made his principal living as a movie projectionist and theater electrician, starting as a prop man at the Majestic Theater in Bloomington, Illinois. He served as President of Local 193 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), and retired as a projectionist in 1972.

=== Professional writing ===
In 1941, Tucker&#x27;s first professional short story, &quot;Interstellar Way Station&quot;, was published by Frederik Pohl in the May issue of &quot;Super Science Stories&quot;. Between 1941 and 1979, primarily in the early 1940s and early 1950s, he produced about two dozen more. He also turned his attention to writing novels, with 11 mystery novels and a dozen science fiction novels to his credit.

His most famous novel may be &quot;The Year of the Quiet Sun&quot; (1970). It was runner-up for the Locus Award for Best Novel and a finalist for the Hugo and the Nebula Award. In 1976 it won a special retrospective John W. Campbell Memorial Award (established 1973 for 1972 novels).

Other notable novels include &quot;The Lincoln Hunters&quot; (1958), in which time-travelers from an oppressive future society seek to record Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;lost speech&quot; of May 19, 1856. It contains a vivid description of Lincoln and his time, seen through the eyes of a future American who feels that Lincoln and his time compare very favorably with the traveler&#x27;s own.

&quot;The Long Loud Silence&quot; (1952) is a post-apocalypse story in which the eastern third of the United States is quarantined as the result of an atomic and bacteriological attack. Damon Knight called it &quot;a phenomenally good book; in its own terms, it comes as near perfection as makes no difference.&quot;

Much of Tucker&#x27;s short fiction was collected in &quot;The Best of Wilson Tucker&quot; (Timescape, 1982; ).

Tucker&#x27;s habit of using the names of friends for minor characters in his fiction led to the literary term &quot;tuckerization&quot; or &quot;tuckerism(s)&quot;. For example, Tucker named a character after Lee Hoffman in his novel &quot;The Long Loud Silence&quot;, after Robert Bloch in &quot;The Lincoln Hunters&quot;, and after Walt Willis in &quot;Wild Talent&quot;.

<doc id="1112393" wikidata="Q16121881" url="?curid=1112393" title="James McCrae (politician)">
<text>James Collus McCrae (born September 19, 1948) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1999, in the Progressive Conservative Party caucus. From 1988 to 1999, McCrae was a cabinet minister in the government of Premier Gary Filmon.

==Early life and career==

McCrae was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. He was educated at Vincent Massey High School in Brandon, Manitoba and the Bryan College of Court Reporting in Los Angeles, California. He served as a court reporter for a number of years and was a Hansard reporter for the House of Commons of Canada from 1975 to 1982. McCrae served as a city councillor for Brandon City Council from 1983 to 1986.

==Provincial politics==
McCrae was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, defeating New Democratic Party candidate Arnold Grambo by 1,409 votes in the riding of Brandon West. The NDP under Howard Pawley narrowly won the election, and McCrae joined 25 other Progressive Conservatives in the opposition.

In 1988, the Pawley government was brought down by disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding. The Progressive Conservatives won a minority government in the election that followed; McCrae was re-elected over Liberal candidate John Worley by 1,421 votes, with the NDP falling to third place. On May 9, 1988, McCrae was appointed Attorney General (renamed Minister of Justice and Attorney General) in 1990, Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs and Minister of Cooperative Development, with responsibility for Constitutional Affairs and the Liquor Control Act. On April 21, 1989, he was relieved of all his ministries and responsibilities except for the primary portfolio of Attorney-General.

McCrae was easily re-elected in the 1990 provincial election, defeating NDP candidate and future Brandon mayor Shari Decter Hirst. He was kept in the Justice portfolio and once again given responsibility for constitutional affairs and the Liquor Control Act, as well as Corrections and most of The Corrections Act. As Justice Minister, McCrae was responsible for implementing Canada&#x27;s first administrative licence suspension program for impaired drivers. On constitutional matters, he declared that Manitoba would assist in bringing about aboriginal self-government.

Following a cabinet shuffle on September 10, 1993, McCrae was named as Manitoba&#x27;s Minister of Health. He was again re-elected without difficulty in the 1995 provincial election. During his time as Health Minister, McCrae made the controversial decision to shut down the emergency rooms in Winnipeg&#x27;s community hospitals in favour of more centralized E.R. services.

A further cabinet shuffle on January 6, 1997, made McCrae Minister of Environment and Government House Leader, with responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act. As Environment Minister, McCrae was criticized by the Sierra Club for refusing to bring in plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In the final cabinet shuffle of Filmon&#x27;s government on February 5, 1999, he was named Minister of Education and Training.

Filmon&#x27;s Conservatives were defeated by the New Democratic Party under Gary Doer in the 1999 provincial election. Notwithstanding his long service in government, McCrae lost Brandon West by 352 votes to Scott Smith of the NDP.

==After provincial politics==
After leaving the assembly, McCrae became a real estate agent. He ran for mayor of Brandon in 2002, but lost to Dave Burgess. His campaign was hindered by local opposition to some of the decisions he had made while in government. He did not seek re-election to the provincial legislature in 2003.

He was re-elected to Brandon City Council in October 2006 after a 20-year hiatus. He also wrote a book in 2006, &quot;Dancing Winds&quot;, a romance set during the Second World War at a concentration camp. McCrae was acclaimed to city council in 2010.

In April 2013, McCrae resigned from Brandon City Council. In May, he was named a part-time Citizenship Judge for Winnipeg.

<doc id="1112432" wikidata="Q1477744" url="?curid=1112432" title="Unordered pair">
<text>In mathematics, an unordered pair or pair set is a set of the form {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;}, i.e. a set having two elements &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; with , where {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;} = {&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;}. In contrast, an ordered pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) has &quot;a&quot; as its first element and &quot;b&quot; as its second element, which means (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) ≠ (&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;). 

While the two elements of an ordered pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) need not be distinct, modern authors only call {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;} an unordered pair if &quot;a&quot; ≠ &quot;b&quot;.
But for a few authors a singleton is also considered an unordered pair, although today, most would say that {&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;} is a multiset. It is typical to use the term unordered pair even in the situation where the elements a and b could be equal, as long as this equality has not yet been established.

A set with precisely two elements is also called a 2-set or (rarely) a binary set.

An unordered pair is a finite set; its cardinality (number of elements) is 2 or (if the two elements are not distinct) 1.

In axiomatic set theory, the existence of unordered pairs is required by an axiom, the axiom of pairing.

More generally, an unordered n-tuple is a set of the form {&quot;a&quot;1, &quot;a&quot;2... &quot;an&quot;}.

<doc id="1112439" wikidata="Q318033" url="?curid=1112439" title="Lucien Petit-Breton">
<text>Lucien Georges Mazan (18 October 1882 – 20 December 1917), known by the pseudonym Lucien Petit-Breton (), was a French racing cyclist best known as the first two-time winner of the Tour de France.

He was born in Plessé, Loire-Atlantique, a part of Brittany, now part of Pays de la Loire. When he was six he moved with his parents to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he took the nationality. His cycling career started when he won a bike in a lottery at the age of sixteen. As his father wanted him to do a &#x27;real&#x27; job, he adapted the nickname Lucien Breton for races, to deceive his father. Later he changed it to Petit-Breton, because there already was another cyclist called Lucien Breton.

==Professional career==

His first notable victory was the track cycling championship of Argentina. In 1902 he was drafted in the French Army and moved back to France. In 1904 he won the Bol d&#x27;Or track event at the second attempt, having finished second the previous year and in 1905 he broke the world hour record on the Buffalo cycling track in Paris with 41.110 km. The same year he started road-racing and finished the Tour de France fifth overall. In 1906, he won the third Paris–Tours race and improved on his previous performance by finishing fourth in the Tour.

In 1907, he won the inaugural Milan–San Remo race before entering the Tour. However, by the end of stage five from Lyon to Grenoble, his chance of victory looked slim. Losing contact with the leading riders on the Col de Porte, he could only manage a tenth place, twenty eight minutes behind Emile Georget who won his third stage. However, with the points system, time was irrelevant, and he was still in second place. In the tenth stage, Georget illegally changed bicycles, and was placed last in the stage by the Tour jury, which cost him 44 points. This meant that Petit-Breton took over the lead, and with two stage wins, plus second and third places in eight other stages, he won the Tour with 47 points, 10 point ahead of second placed Gustave Garrigou and 27 points ahead of Georget in third.

He also won the Tour in 1908, becoming the first rider to win the Tour twice, after winning the Paris–Brussels race. As part of the all-conquering Peugeot team that took the first four places, Petit-Breton won the Tour even more easily with just 36 points, finishing outside the first four in just one stage. Behind him, team-mates Francois Faber and Georges Passerieu finished with 68 and 75 points respectively.

That was his last great victory. First World War ended his career. He joined the French army as a driver and died in 1917 when he crashed into a horse and cart which turned in front of him at the front near Troyes. The cart driver was said to be insensible through drink.

Before the war he had started a bicycle shop and high-quality bicycles bearing his name were made in Nantes until the 1960s.

==In popular culture==
The French TV series &quot;Les Brigades du Tigre&quot; was a popular crime drama focusing on an elite squad of police detectives in the early 20th century. In an episode broadcast in 1978 they are appointed to watch over the competitors of the 1908 Tour de France, two of whom have been killed by a man who opposes cycling on the claim that his son was killed in a riding accident. Jacques Giraud appears as Petit Breton who is determined to continue the event come what may and persuades the other hesitant cyclists to also continue on the grounds that they should not let him win without a fight. He himself is later assaulted by the man but defiantly continues the stage to the admiration of those present.

<text>Gerald W. Schwartz, OC (born 1941) is the founder, chairman and CEO of Onex Corporation. Schwartz has a net worth of US$1.5 billion, according to Forbes.

== Early life and career ==
Schwartz was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He graduated from Kelvin High School in Winnipeg. He received his B.A. and LL.B. degrees from the University of Manitoba where he became an active brother of the Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. He later received an MBA degree from Harvard University in 1970.

In the 1970s, Schwartz worked at Bear Stearns, where he was mentored by Jerome Kohlberg, Jr., who later became a founding partner in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. Schwartz left Bear Stearns by 1977, returning to Canada. Along with Izzy Asper, Schwartz co-founded CanWest Global Communications in 1977.

In 1983, Schwartz founded Onex Corporation.

Schwartz has been a director of Scotiabank since 1999. In 2021, Schwartz&#x27;s net worth was estimated at US$1.5 billion, making him one of the wealthiest people in Canada. As of 2015, he was the highest paid CEO in Canada.

==Personal life==
In 1982, Schwartz married Heather Reisman, chief executive of Indigo Books and Music. Schwartz has two children from his first marriage and two stepchildren from his marriage to Heather Reisman. The couple are members of the Reform synagogue, Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto. Schwartz and Reisman own the most expensive house in Toronto, valued at $28 million.

=== Recognition ===
The Gerald Schwartz School of Business at St. Francis Xavier University was named in his honour in recognition of his donations to the university. In 2005, he was awarded the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur Of The Year 2005 Ontario Lifetime Achievement award. In 2006, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

=== Philanthropy ===

Schwartz is the co-founder of the Heseg Foundation for Lone Soldiers alongside his wife, Heather Reisman. The organization provides millions of dollars of support in the form of scholarships, a living wage and career development opportunities as a reward for military service with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) every year to non-Israeli Jews who volunteered to join the Israeli military and to some Israeli soldiers as well. In 2006, he made a donation to University of Waterloo for an exchange program between University of Waterloo and the University of Haifa.

Mount Sinai Hospital announced in December 2013 that a transformational $15 million gift from Schwartz and Reisman would be used to &quot;reshape emergency medicine&quot; at the facility.

The Gerald Schwartz and Heather Reisman Foundation donated $5.3 million to St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia in late 2018 to create scholarships, bursaries and increased recruitment of business students.

In March 2019, University of Toronto announced that Schwartz and Reisman were giving the university $100 million to build a 750,000-square foot innovation centre through the Gerald Schwartz &amp; Heather Reisman Foundation. According to Reisman, the Schwartz Reisman Innovation Centre will be used to improve technology, particularly Artificial intelligence, and how the public can relate to it. One of the two towers will house the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence while the other will include labs for research in regenerative medicine, genetics and precision medicine.

<text>Ayxun or Aissó was a nobleman who led a revolt in Barcelona, Ausona, and Girona in 826 to 827. His identity is uncertain.

Aissó is thought to have been either a Goth and former lieutenant of the disposed Count Berà, or an Arab (Ayxun ibn Sulayman ibn Yaqdhan al-Arabí), the son of Sulayman al-Arabi who had been imprisoned in Aachen after being captured by Frankish forces at Girona.

After Bernat of Septimania was anointed Count of Barcelona, Aisso joined the revolt against the new count. Only the castle of Roda de Ter, in the county of Ausona, resisted and was destroyed by revolters. Many Goth nobles joined Aissó and Guillemó (or Guillemundus) son of Berà and Count of Rasez and Conflent.

Aissó raided the County of Cerdanya and the region of Vallés from his base in the centre of Catalonia. The young Count Bernat requested and received some help from the Emperor, as well as from some local Goth noblemen or &quot;Hispani&quot; (826).

Faced with this opposition, Aissó appealed to the sole power that could be compared to the Franks, the Emir of Córdoba. He sent a deputation, led by his brother, to request help from Abd ar-Rahman II. He sent his General, Ubayd Allah (also known as Abu Marwan), who arrived in Zaragoza in May 827. From there, his forces entered the territory of the County of Barcelona, reaching the City of Barcelona later that summer. The city was besieged without success; however, the surroundings were ransacked. The army then moved to Girona, which was attacked on October 10, 827.

When Louis I the Pious heard of the Muslim raid, he ordered to his son Pepin I of Aquitaine, and Counts Hugo of Tours and Matfred of Orleans to recruit an army. However, recruitment was slow and, by the time it was formed, Abu Merwan was already returning south. The rebels fled with them in 826. Aissó probably sought refuge in Córdoba, where he was later murdered on the orders of the Emir, who was suspicious of a conspiracy. Guillemó also lived the rest of his life in exile in Córdoba.

<text>USS &quot;Hackleback&quot; (SS-295), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named after the hackleback, a freshwater fish of the sturgeon family.

&quot;Hackleback&quot; was launched 30 May 1943 by the Cramp Shipbuilding Co., Philadelphia; sponsored by Mrs. W. L. Wright; and commissioned 7 November 1944.

After training out of New London, &quot;Hackleback&quot; reported to the Fleet Sonar School at Key West 24 December. Two weeks training there were followed by further training at Balboa, Canal Zone, and &quot;Hackleback&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor 25 January 1945. The new submarine participated in still more training exercises at Pearl Harbor before departing for her first war patrol 6 March.

Japanese merchant shipping had been decimated by the Pacific submarine fleet, and &quot;Hackleback&quot; was to encounter no suitable targets in any of her patrols. But on this first patrol, she played a key role in the sinking of the last of Japan&#x27;s super-battleships, the &quot;Yamato&quot;.

Patrolling the Bungo Suido area late in the night of 6 April, &quot;Hackleback&quot; made radar contact on a fast group of ships at about . She sent a steady stream of location reports back to Pearl Harbor, at the same time attempting to close with the task group. &quot;Hackleback&quot; three times came to within of the &quot;Yamato&quot; force, but destroyers forced her out of range before she could get in position to fire torpedoes.

&quot;Yamato&quot; was not to escape, however. The following morning, 7 April, planes from Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s famous TF 58, guided by &quot;Hackleback&quot;&#x27;s contact location reports, struck the &quot;Yamato&quot; group. In four successive waves, the carrier planes accounted for the destruction of &quot;Yamato&quot;, the light cruiser &quot;Yahagi&quot;, and two destroyers, leaving only six destroyers of the Japanese task force to escape.

During the rest of her first patrol, &quot;Hackleback&quot; made two gun attacks on small ships, but discontinued the engagements when it appeared they were trying to lure her in close to shore. Returning to Midway 26 April, she prepared for a second patrol and on 21 May sailed.

This time &quot;Hackleback&quot;&#x27;s primary mission was lifeguard duty off Sakishima Gunto as the carriers pounded the Japanese home islands. On 22 June she picked up a downed carrier pilot, Lt. Comdr. C. P. Smith. &quot;Hackleback&quot; also engaged in some shore bombardment. After an air strike on Shokoto Sho 7 July, the submarine closed the island and fired 73 rounds of shells. No surface contacts were made on this patrol. Hackleback returned to Guam 12 July.

Sailing for her third war patrol 14 August, the submarine received an unofficial flash &quot;Tokyo accepts&quot; that same day, and on 16 August headed for Midway. The long Pacific war had ended. &quot;Hackleback&quot; spent 2 weeks at Midway and then sailed for home, reaching San Francisco 11 September.

&quot;Hackleback&quot; decommissioned there 20 March 1946 and was placed in reserve at Mare Island. &quot;Hacklebacks classification was changed toAGSS-295&quot;&#x27; on 6 November 1962. Her name was struck from the Navy List 1 March 1967 and was sold for scrapping, 4 December 1968 to Zidell Explorations, Portland, Ore.

<text>The Queensland Rugby Football League (QRL) is the governing body for rugby league in Queensland. It is a member of the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARL Commission) and selects the members of the Queensland rugby league team.

The QRL aims to &quot;foster, develop, extend, govern and control Rugby League Football throughout the State of Queensland&quot;. Today the QRL administers the rugby league through its regional divisions. It is also responsible for the Queensland Rugby League team. The QRL&#x27;s headquarters are on Vulture Street, Woolloongabba in Brisbane.

==History of the QRL==
The Queensland Rugby Football League was formed in 1908 by seven rugby players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU) as the Queensland Rugby Association. Those founding fathers were Micky Dore, George Watson, Jack Fihelly, J O&#x27;Connor. E Buchanan, Alf Faulkner and Sine Boland. Discussion about breaking away from the rugby &#x27;union&#x27; and forming a professional &#x27;league&#x27; in Queensland can be traced as far back as 1905 through the visions of then Deputy State Premier, Michael Allison.
On 14 March 1908, the breakaway group was first mentioned in the local media, and a fortnight later the first official announcement was made regarding the formation of the Queensland Rugby Association was made. On 16 May that year a hastily assembled Queensland team played the touring New Zealand &quot;All Golds&quot; side in Brisbane. Later that month there were three representative games against New South Wales, which acted as selection trials for a national team.

In 1909, club rugby league officially began, with W. Evans scoring the inaugural try before backing up with another as North Brisbane beat Toombul 8–0 at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, although Valleys were the first premiers. Other teams that entered the competition include: Milton (1909), South Brisbane (1909), West End (1910), Natives (1912), Merthyr (1917) and Coorparoo (1917).

In 2012, the QRL formally joined with the NSWRL and each National Rugby League club, to form the Australian Rugby League Commission, which is the overarching governing body for all of Rugby League throughout Australia. Notwithstanding the Commission&#x27;s role as supreme governing authority for the code, the QRL retains responsibility for both management of the Queensland State of Origin team in Origin series, as well as day-to-day accountability for the operations of the Queensland Cup second-tier league, and junior representative Rugby League, plus divisional leagues, throughout Queensland.

== Current Major Competitions ==

===Hostplus Cup===
The Queensland Cup has been contested since 1996. Since 1998 the team winning the Queensland Cup is considered to be the premier club team in Queensland.

===FOGS Cup===
The Brisbane A-Grade Rugby League, also known as the FOGS Cup, and the FOGS Colts Challenge is run by the Queensland Rugby League&#x27;s South East Division. It is regarded as the division below the Queensland Cup.

===Cyril Connell Cup and Mal Meninga Cup===
The Cyril Connell Cup &amp; Mal Meninga Cup were introduced in 2009 to provide a pathway for young rugby league players to reach the professional levels of the game. Named after famous Queensland rugby league personalities Cyril Connell and Mal Meninga, the Cups have proved popular. Both competitions have the same structure of sixteen team split into two geographically aligned groups. Pool A contains teams from outside of Brisbane while Pool B comprises teams from the Brisbane metropolitan area and two Gold Coast Rugby League selections. The Cyril Connell Cup was discontinued after 2016.

The teams are:

=== 47th Battalion Shield ===
Like the Northern Division&#x27;s &quot;Foley Shield&quot; or the South-East Division&#x27;s &quot;Bulimba Cup&quot; the &quot;47th Battalion Shield&quot; is run as the Central Region&#x27;s regional Carnival and none of the teams are club teams, with the only exception being some of the Women&#x27;s teams. Its traditionally held over one weekend and normally at one venue with multiple grounds to play on.

===The Foley Shield===
The Foley Shield competition began in North Queensland in 1948. With the introduction of the Queensland Cup in 1996 the Foley Shield competition was scrapped, only to be reintroduced in 2000. Since the revamp in 2000 it has only contested by the three largest cities in North Queensland; Cairns, Mackay and Townsville.

=== Former ===

==== Brisbane Rugby League Premiership ====

The Brisbane Rugby League Premiership was a former top-flight rugby league competition. The competition ran fom 1922 until 1997, but became a second tier competition with the advent of the ARL Premiership in 1995.

==== Bulimba Cup ====

The Bulimba Cup was similar to the Foley Shield in that it was contested by city representative sides in a region, this time the South East Region, with the teams being Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba.

<text>The New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL) is the governing body for the sport of rugby league football in New Zealand. The NZRL was founded on 25 April 1910 in preparation for a tour of Great Britain that same year.

The NZRL administers the &quot;New Zealand&quot; &quot;Kiwis&quot; and the &quot;New Zealand Kiwi Ferns.&quot; Currently they manage the NZRL National Secondary Schools Tournament, the NZRL National Youth Tournament, the NZRL National 9s, the NZRL National Women&#x27;s Competition and the NZRL National Men&#x27;s Competition. The premier competition is known as the National Premiership and the National Championship, which is a tier below. Previously, there was also a National 20&#x27;s Competition launched in 2021 as a new pathway for developing elite talent. They are also responsible for elite pathway programmes including the NZ 16s and NZ 18s teams, the NZ Taurahere and the Junior Kiwis. They have previously managed the now defunct Lion Red Cup and Bartercard Cup competitions.

The NZRL is an incorporated society under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908. The current patron of the NZRL is Sir Anand Satyanand, who replaced Sir Peter Leitch in the role in 2019.

==History==

In April 1910, the New Zealand Rugby League was formed for the purpose of administering the new code in New Zealand and &quot;with the blessing of the Northern Rugby Football Union, on the condition that the Auckland District would not have the management of the entire game in New Zealand&quot;.

<text>Jim Lewis (born James Lewis Slayden; June 5, 1941 – February 21, 1995) was an American astrologer, writer and entrepreneur. He is known for pioneering the technique of astrocartography, a form of locational astrology.

==Early life==
James Lewis Slayden was born on June 5, 1941 in Yonkers, New York. He spent time living at a commune in Big Sur, California, where he hunted deer.

==Career==

Locational astrology is an old concept, but Lewis expanded a little-known field, using detailed maps and modern software. In 1979, Lewis published the first edition of his annual &quot;Sourcebook of Mundane Maps&quot;. Lewis submitted a patent application for his system in 1980, which was granted on December 8, 1981.

Lewis lectured throughout the world and regularly conducted seminars in which he trained students in astrocartography techniques. He later went on to administer a certification exam. Candidates who passed his stringent qualifications were given a certificate as a professional astrocartographers.

Lewis&#x27;s theories were subsequently developed by other astrologers, including Steve Cozzi and Martin Jay Davis. For his original work in developing and promoting the technique of astrocartography, Lewis received the Marc Edmund Jones award in 1978 and the &quot;Regulus Award for Discovery, Innovation, and Research&quot; at the United Astrology Congress in Washington, DC, in 1992.

==Personal life and death==

Lewis was gay and lived in San Francisco for most of his life. In the mid-1980s he was struck by a vehicle while crossing Military Road in Sydney, Australia, which is on his Mars Ascending line. Lewis died of a brain tumor in San Francisco on February 21, 1995, at age 53.

==Legacy==
In his will, Lewis provided for the formation of the Astrocartography Trust. In 1999, the Trust applied for a trademark for the mark &quot;ASTRO*CARTO*GRAPHY&quot;, which was granted on October 3, 2000. The registration was cancelled by the USPTO on May 6, 2011.

<doc id="1112469" wikidata="Q846006" url="?curid=1112469" title="Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Brussels">
<text>The National Basilica of the Sacred Heart (; ) is a Catholic minor basilica and parish church in Brussels, Belgium. It is dedicated to the Sacred Heart, inspired by the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur in Paris. Symbolically, King Leopold II laid the first stone in 1905 during the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of Belgian independence. The construction was halted by the two world wars and finished only in 1970. Belonging to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Mechelen–Brussels, it is the 14th largest church by area in the world and the largest in Belgium.

Located at the head of Elisabeth Park atop the Koekelberg hill, between the municipalities of Koekelberg and Ganshoren, the church is popularly known as the Koekelberg Basilica (; ). The massive brick and reinforced concrete structure, in Art Deco style of neo-Byzantine inspiration, features two thinner towers and a nearly as high green copper dome that rises above ground, dominating Brussels&#x27; north-western skyline. It is served by the tram stop / (on line 9).

==History==

===Inception===
In the mid-19th century, King Leopold I dreamed of turning the uninhabited Koekelberg hill in north-western Brussels into a royal residence area. After his death, his son, King Leopold II, envisaged building a Belgian Panthéon dedicated to Great Belgians there, inspired by the French Panthéon in Paris, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence. The king dropped this project due to the lack of enthusiasm of the Belgian population. It is nonetheless still attested today by the two large avenues—the / and the /—that adjoin the site.

In 1902, Leopold II visited the Basilique du Sacré-Cœur of Paris, and inspired by it, decided to build a pilgrimage church back home, a national sanctuary dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. While he saw the opportunity to build his national Panthéon at the Namur Gate in Ixelles, Leopold II accepted that the land of Koekelberg be ceded by the to the Catholic Church with a view to building instead the national basilica there. The deed of donation of the of land was signed on 12 December and confirmed on 31 December through a royal decree.

===Neo-Gothic basilica (1905–1914)===
The initial project of the Leuven-based architect was a sumptuous neo-Gothic basilica inspired by the &quot;ideal cathedral&quot; of the French architectural theorist Eugène Viollet-le-Duc. Langerock envisaged an edifice bristling with six towers of a hundred metres or more, the highest of which would have culminated at above the crossing.

Leopold II laid the first stone on 12 October 1905 during the celebrations commemorating the 75th anniversary of Belgian independence. The foundation works started in 1909, but the project was delayed due to the king&#x27;s death on 17 December 1909. Financing the basilica&#x27;s construction also soon became a problem, so only the foundations had been finished when World War I broke out. In his pastoral letter for Christmas 1914, Cardinal Mercier gave the basilica a new meaning:


===Art Deco basilica (1919–present)===
On 29 June 1919, King Albert I and a large crowd associated themselves with this promise in a ceremony on the Koekelberg hill. However, it was impossible to resume Langerock&#x27;s plan due to the state of public finances. A new project, in Art Deco style of neo-Byzantine inspiration, by the Ghent architect , was thus adopted. In 1925, a 1/40 scale model of this final design won the great architectural prize at the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts in Paris. This model, produced with the greatest care, still stands today in the basilica.

The adaptation and extension of the existing foundations were undertaken from January 1926, and the building of the apse began in August 1930. After Van Huffel&#x27;s death on 16 March 1935, the construction was taken over by his assistant, the architect-engineer Paul Rome. Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey consecrated the unfinished basilica and opened it for worship on 14 October 1935, after obtaining a special authorisation from Pope Pius XI. The base of the cupola was finished in 1940 when World War II brought a new halt to the works. Building resumed in September 1944 and the main nave was completed in 1951.

The basilica was consecrated by Cardinal Van Roey on 13 and 14 October 1951, and Pope Pius XII assigned it the title of minor basilica on 28 January 1952. In 1953, the two towers were completed. The south transept opened in 1958 and the north transept in 1962. The cupola and thus the external structure was finished in 1969, and on 11 November 1970, the ceremony for the 25th anniversary of the episcopate of Archbishop of Mechelen–Brussels, Cardinal Leo Joseph Suenens, marked the completion of the basilica&#x27;s construction. On 4 June 1995, Father Damien was beatified in the basilica by Pope John Paul II.

==Building==

===Dimensions===
The Koekelberg Basilica is one of the largest Art Deco buildings in the world, and was, at the time of its construction, the fifth largest church building in the world, at high and long (outside length). It remains today one of the largest basilicas and can accommodate 3,500 people. The central nave is long, and at its widest, the building is . The cupola rises above ground and has a diameter of .

This enormous building houses Catholic Church celebrations in the two main Belgian national languages (Dutch and French), as well as conferences, exhibitions (as in 2007–08, the International Leonardo da Vinci Expo), a restaurant, a Catholic radio station, a theatre and two museums.

===Exterior===
The building&#x27;s exterior combines reinforced concrete with terracotta layering, Dutch belvédère bricks, and white dimension stone from Burgundy. The green roofs and domes are clad in Congolese copper.

The main entrance is flanked by two slender towers, high, topped with reduced domes. The narthex-portal has a large balcony intended for open-air masses, the parapet of which was carved with a bas-relief depicting &quot;Christ the Merciful&quot;. Its pillars are extended by statues of the four evangelists by the Belgian-Danish sculptor . From left to right, they depict &quot;Saint John and his eagle&quot; (1955), &quot;Saint Luke carrying the bull&quot; (1958), &quot;Saint Mark enlaced by the lion&quot; (1958), and &quot;Saint Matthew with man&quot; (1964).

===Interior===
The basilica&#x27;s interior possesses a rich architectural heritage and holds an exceptional collection of works of art, including &quot;Tête du Christ&quot; bronze sculpture by Constant Permeke, thirty-one engravings by Joan Miró about the Canticle of the Sun by Saint Francis of Assisi, a painting by Antoni Tàpies, a photographic work by called &quot;When Jesus Became Christ&quot; on the theme of the crucifixion, seven original lithographs by Alfred Manessier on the theme of Easter and the Mount of Olives, works by James Ensor, a painting by Geneviève Asse on the biblical theme, as well as paintings by Albert Servaes. The painter Anto Carte designed the eight stained glass windows representing the life of Jesus, and the artist an additional twenty-eight.

The altar, the liturgical furniture and the cross in the choir are the work of the sculptor . The basilica also contains two organs: a large 1959 modern choir organ and a 1965 classical choir organ in the crypt.

==Panoramic view==
The basilica, on the Koekelberg hill, is a landmark on the Brussels skyline. The cupola&#x27;s platform offers an excellent panoramic view of Brussels and the wider region of Flemish Brabant. Visitors can reach the platform either by stairs or by two lifts commissioned in the spring of 2012, in the form of a cage and two fully glazed cabins.

<doc id="1112478" wikidata="Q3294366" url="?curid=1112478" title="East New York, Brooklyn">
<text>East New York is a residential neighborhood in the eastern section of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise, are roughly the Cemetery Belt and the Queens borough line to the north; the Queens borough line to the east; Jamaica Bay to the south; and the New York City Subway&#x27;s BMT Canarsie Line, the Bay Ridge Branch railroad tracks, and Van Sinderen Avenue to the west. Linden Boulevard, Pennsylvania Avenue, and Atlantic Avenue are the primary thoroughfares through East New York.

East New York was founded as the Town of New Lots in the 1650s. It was annexed as the 26th Ward of the rapidly growing City of Brooklyn in 1886, and became part of New York City in 1898. During the latter part of the twentieth century, East New York came to be predominantly inhabited by African Americans and Latinos.

East New York is part of Brooklyn Community District 5, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11207, 11208, and 11239. It is patrolled by the 75th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 2. Coverage by the Fire Department of New York is provided by Battalions 39 &amp; 44. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 37th and 42nd Districts.

==History==

===Early history and development===
At the northern edge of what is now East New York, a chain of hills—also known as a terminal moraine—separates northwestern Long Island from Jamaica and the Hempstead Plains, the main part of Long Island&#x27;s fertile outwash plain. The southern portions of the neighborhood, meanwhile, consisted of salt marshes and several creeks, which drained into Jamaica Bay. These areas were originally settled by the Jameco Native Americans, and later used by the Canarsee and Rockaway tribes as fishing grounds.

In the 1650s Dutch colonists began settling in what are now the eastern sections of Brooklyn, forming the towns of Flatbush, Bushwick, and New Lots (the predecessor of East New York). The area along with the rest of Brooklyn and modern New York City was ceded to the British Empire in 1664. A few 18th-century roads, including the ferry road or &quot;Palmer Turnpike&quot; from Brooklyn to Jamaica, passed through the chain of hills; hence the area was called &quot;Jamaica Pass&quot;. During the American Revolutionary War, invading British and Hessian (German) soldiers ended an all-night forced march at this pass in August 1776 to surprise and flank General George Washington and the Continental Army, to win the Battle of Long Island (also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights).

In 1835, Connecticut merchant John Pitkin (the namesake of Pitkin Avenue) purchased the land of the Town of New Lots north of New Lots Avenue, opening a shoe factory at what is now Williams Street and Pitkin Avenue. Pitkin named the area &quot;East New York&quot; to signify it as the eastern end of New York City. In 1836 the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad (soon to become part of the Long Island Rail Road, or LIRR) opened through the area; it did not originally stop in East New York, but a stop there was added by 1844. The LIRR moved its terminus to Queens in 1860, and the line through Brooklyn was shortened to end at East New York.

In 1852, New Lots was officially ceded from the Town of Flatbush. In the middle 19th century, the road between Brooklyn and Jamaica became the Brooklyn and Jamaica Plank Road. The Brooklyn and Rockaway Beach Railroad (1865) was built to connect the LIRR&#x27;s Atlantic Branch with Canarsie at a point later known as Broadway Junction. As often happened at 19th-century railroad junctions, a railway town arose. Sprawling development into the recently rustic northern part of the Town of New Lots followed the reach of elevated transit lines into the area: the Jamaica Avenue Line in 1885 and the Fulton Street Line in 1889. The road to Brooklyn was renamed Fulton Street, the one to Jamaica, Jamaica Avenue, and the one to Williamsburg, Broadway.

===Annexation to Brooklyn and 20th century===
East New York (as the Town of New Lots) was annexed as the 26th Ward of the rapidly growing City of Brooklyn in 1886; in 1898 after a decade-long controversy with debates, campaigns and publicity, the community was merged into New York City as a whole with the consolidation of Brooklyn and the other four boroughs into a single entity as the &quot;City of Greater New York&quot;. In the 20th century its name came to be applied to much of the former township.

In 1939, the Works Progress Administration &quot;Guide to New York City&quot; wrote:

After World War II, thousands of manufacturing jobs left New York City thereby increasing the importance of the remaining jobs to those with limited education and job skills. During this same period, large numbers of Puerto Ricans from the Caribbean island and African-Americans from the South emigrated to New York City looking for employment. East New York, no longer replete with the jobs the new residents had come for, was thereby faced with a host of new socioeconomic problems, including widespread unemployment and crime.

===Economic downturn===

Walter Thabit, a city planner for East New York, chronicled in his 2003 book, &quot;How East New York Became a Ghetto&quot;, the change in population from mostly working class Italians and Jewish residents to residents of Puerto Rican and African American descent. Thabit argues that landlords and real estate agents played a significant role in the downturn of the area. Puerto Ricans were moving to New York City in the late 1950s, at a time when unemployment rates in Puerto Rico soared to 25 percent, and left Puerto Rico on the brink of poverty. By 1966, Blacks and Puerto Ricans were the majority of the neighborhood with around 48,000 Black residents, 30,000 Puerto Rican residents, and 22,000 remaining White residents mostly Italian and Jewish residents, though eventually pretty much almost all of the White residents would vacate out of the neighborhood in the later decades. Poverty became very highly concentrated with the neighborhood&#x27;s population largely being on welfare benefits by the 1960s as well as the neighborhood also began to suffer with a lot of arson and fires to property buildings and as well as buildings and houses increasingly becoming abandoned by previously occupied Italian and Jewish residents as a result of increasing crime rates and racial tensions between White and non-White residents and there have been some reported cases during the 1960s of Italian youths and Black/Puerto Rican Youths getting into racially physical fights. Thabit also describes how the construction of public housing projects in East New York further contributed to its decline, noting that many of the developments were built by corrupt managers and contractors. He argues that the city government largely ignored the community when it could have helped turn it around. Writing in the &quot;New York Press&quot;, Michael Manville accused Thabit of poor research, sweeping generalizations, and a failure to distinguish the actions of allegedly racist individuals from the effects of what he describes as &quot;a racist capitalist system&quot;, and contends that much of the urban renewal and public housing efforts of the period were in fact well-intentioned, if ill-considered and hubristic.

Since the late 1950s, East New York has had some of the highest crime rates in Brooklyn, and is considered by some to be the borough&#x27;s murder capital, alongside Brownsville. Many social struggles associated with poverty—including crime and drug addiction—have been prevalent in the area for decades. Despite the decline of crime compared to their peaks during the crack and heroin epidemics, violent crime continues to be widespread in the community. East New York&#x27;s 75th Police Precinct reported the highest murder rate in the city in 2011, according to crime reports compiled by DNAinfo.com. East New York has significantly higher dropout rates and incidences of violence in its schools. Students must pass through metal detectors and swipe ID cards to enter the buildings. Other problems in local schools include low test scores and high truancy rates.
===Urban renewal and early signs of gentrification===
In the 1980s East Brooklyn Congregations (EBC), an affiliate of the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) organized to address the need for quality affordable housing in East New York. This coalition advocated that vacant New York City owned land be provided at no cost for the development of new affordable owner occupied housing with subsidies for low-interest mortgages. This effort was called the Nehemiah Program. It was replicated in other parts of the city and country and led to national legislation. The Nehemiah homes were funded by a loan from $8 million loan fund from three Brooklyn Churches. Its setup was described as follows by &quot;The New York Times&quot; the city provides vacant sites, forgives real-estate taxes on the homes (but not the land) for 10 years, and provides what amounts to a $10,000 interest-free loan per house. Buyers pay $43,500 (their median income was $27,000; 40 percent moved from public or subsidized housing).&quot;

New developments are rising in the area, including the Gateway Center shopping mall located on what was once part of a landfill near Jamaica Bay. Gateway Center, in Spring Creek, is a suburban-style shopping complex with multiple large stores. Gateway Center consists of two structures. Gateway Center South, the first structure, opened in 2002, and Gateway Center North, the second development, opened in 2014.

Although East New York has not experienced the same level of gentrification as many other Brooklyn neighborhoods, since the 2010s it has been moving into the pre gentrification stages as real estate companies have been trying to buy up properties and raise property value prices. With the neighborhood rezoned in 2016 under Bill de Blasio&#x27;s administration, luxury housing developments have been introduced into the area. Real estate agencies have sometimes persuaded homeowners to sell the properties to them, and often they would resell them to other companies for a higher price. Local residents, who are overwhelmingly Black and Latino, have accused these real estate companies of being racist and trying to gentrify them out of the neighborhood to bring wealthier, white residents.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2010 United States census, the population of East New York was 91,958, an increase of 8,683 (10.4%) from the 83,275 counted in the 2000 census. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 63.6% (58,453) African American, 3.0% (2,764) Asian, 1.3% (1,240) White, 0.3% (291) Native American, 0.0% (38) Pacific Islander, 0.7% (683) from other races, and 1.3% (1,237) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 29.6% (27,252) of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 5 had 181,300 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 78.6 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 27% are between the ages of 0 and 17, 28% between 25 and 44, and 34% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 10% and 12% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community Board 5 was $36,786. In 2018, an estimated 30% of East New York residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in ten residents (10%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 52% in East New York, higher than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , East New York is considered to be low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

During the 1960s, East New York transitioned from being predominately Jewish and Italian to being predominately African American and Puerto Rican. However, now East New York is more diversified, with large African American, Puerto Rican, Dominican, West Indian, and South Asian populations. According to the 2020 census data from New York City Department of City Planning, Black residents make up the majority of East New York, but there are also significant populations of Hispanic residents. In East New York North, there are between 20,000 and 29,999 Black residents and between 10,000 and 19,999 Hispanic residents. City Line has about an equal population of Black and Hispanic residents (10,000 to 19,999) and 5,000 to 9,999 Asian residents. East New York New Lots has 30,000 to 39,999 Black residents and 10,000 to 19,999 Hispanic residents. Cypress Hills is the only section of East New York that has a majority Hispanic community, with 20,000 to 29,999 Hispanic residents and 5,000 to 9,999 Black residents. In all parts of East New York except for City Line, there were less than 5,000 white and Asian residents.

==Geography==

East New York covers a relatively large area, abutting the Queens border to the north and east. North of East New York is Highland Park, the Cemetery Belt, and the neighborhoods of Ridgewood and Glendale in Queens. The neighborhoods of Bushwick and Bedford–Stuyvesant are northwest of East New York, while Brownsville is to the west and Canarsie is to the southwest. Jamaica Bay and the Shirley Chisholm State Park are located on the southern shore, while Woodhaven, Ozone Park, and Howard Beach in Queens are located to the east.

===Land use===
East New York consists of mixed properties but primarily semi-detached homes, two-to-four family houses, and multi-unit apartment buildings, including condominiums and co-ops. The total land area is one square mile.

The area is also home to the East Brooklyn Industrial Park. The 44-block industrial park was established in 1980 by the New York City Public Development Corporation in East New York&#x27;s northwest quadrant. It is bounded by Atlantic Avenue, Sheffield Avenue, Sutter Avenue and Powell Street.

=====NYCHA Converted Section 8 RAD Developments=====

Several of the public housing developments in East New York have been switched to this program as of December 28, 2021 along with providing social service providers on their sites to cater to the needs of their local residents, which is nearly half of the East New York NYCHA developments being converted to this program.

NYCHA signed public–private partnership leases with &quot;The Hudson Companies, Inc.&quot;; &quot;Property Resources Corporation&quot;; &quot;Duvernay + Brooks LLC&quot;; &quot;Property Resources Corporation&quot;; and &quot;Lisa Management, Inc.&quot; to manage Belmont-Sutter Area Houses, Boulevard Houses, and Fiorentino Plaza Houses with a contracted social services provider called CAMBA, Inc. on their sites and as well as with &quot;Douglaston Development&quot;; &quot;L+M Development Partners&quot;; &quot;Dantes Partners&quot;; &quot;SMJ Development Corp&quot;; &quot;Clinton Management&quot;; and &quot;C&amp;C Apartment Management LLC&quot; to manage Linden Houses and Pennsylvania Avenue-Wortman Avenue Houses with a contracted social services provider called University Settlement on their sites.

<text>Roman Urdu is the name used for the Urdu language written with the Latin script, also known as Roman script.

According to the Urdu scholar Habib R. Sulemani: &quot;Roman Urdu is strongly opposed by the traditional Arabic script lovers. Despite this opposition it is still used by most on the internet and computers due to limitations of most technologies as they do not have the Urdu script. Although, this script is under development and thus the net users are using the Roman script in their own ways. Popular websites like Jang Group have devised their own schemes for Roman Urdu. This is of great advantage for those who are not able to read the Arabic script. MSN, Yahoo and some desi-chat-rooms are working as laboratories for the evolving new script and language (Roman Urdu).&quot;

Romanized Urdu is mutually intelligible with Romanized Hindi in informal contexts, unlike Urdu written in the Urdu alphabet and Hindi in Devanagari. Multinational corporations often use it as a cost effective method for printing and advertising in order to market their products in both Pakistan and India.

Although the idea of romanising Urdu had been suggested several times, it was General Ayub Khan who most seriously suggested adopting the Latin alphabet for Urdu and all Pakistani languages during his rule of the country. The suggestion was inspired to an extent by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s adoption of the Latin alphabet for Turkish in Turkey.

In India, where the Devanagari script is used, Roman Urdu was widely used in the Indian Army, as well as in Christian mission schools, especially for translations of the Bible.

The Hunterian transliteration system mostly avoids diacritics and non-standard characters.

== Usage ==
=== Christian community in the Indian subcontinent ===
Urdu was the dominant native language among Christians of Karachi, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan in the 20th century and is still used today by some people in these states. Pakistani and Indian Christians often used the Roman script for writing Urdu. The Bible Society of India publishes Roman Urdu Bibles, which enjoyed sale late into the 1960s (though they are still published today). Church songbooks are also common in Roman Urdu. However, its usage in Christian contexts is declining in India with the wider use of Hindi and English in the states.

=== Film industry ===
Bollywood, India&#x27;s major film industry, uses a version of Roman script as the main script for its film titles. This is because Bollywood films have an appeal for viewers across South Asia and even in the Middle East. The Devanāgarī script is used mostly by Hindi speakers while the Perso-Arabic script is used primarily by Urdu speakers. The language used in Bollywood films is often called Hindi, but most dialogues are actually written in Hindustani—they can be understood by Urdu and Hindi speakers alike. Because the film industry wants to reach the largest possible audience, just using the Devanāgarī or Perso-Arabic script would be unfavorable for the Bollywood industry as few individuals are literate in both scripts. For this reason, the neutral Roman script is used for Bollywood film titles, though some films include the Hindi and Urdu scripts as well.

The similar circumstances are also applied with Pakistan&#x27;s Lollywood filming industry, where, along with the Urdu name or title of the movie, a Roman Urdu title is always provided for viewers.

=== Internet ===
Roman Urdu used on the Internet is non-standard and has irregular spelling. Users who use Roman Urdu on the Internet try to imitate English orthography. In most cases they are unaware of the fact that English spelling is not always phonetic.

=== Education ===
Roman Urdu is increasingly used in educational resources aimed at diaspora communities and non-native speakers. Kids Bolo has pioneered the use of Roman Urdu in both print and digital formats to teach Urdu. Their approach includes illustrated books written in Roman Urdu and interactive online conversation classes, which simplify language learning for students familiar with the Latin alphabet but not the traditional Urdu script. This methodology helps learners achieve conversational fluency and encourages cultural connection through language.

== Romanization schemes ==
There are several Romanization standards for writing Urdu among them the most prominent are Uddin and Begum Urdu-Hindustani Romanization, ALA-LC romanization and ArabTeX.

There are two main problems with existing Roman Urdu schemes. Either they are not reversible to Urdu script or they do not allow pronouncing the Urdu words properly. Another shortcoming is that a lot of Roman Urdu schemes confuse the Urdu letter &#x27;Choti He&#x27; which has the sound of voiceless glottal fricative with &#x27;Do Chasham He&#x27; which is used as a digraph for aspirated consonants in Urdu script. The digraphs &quot;Sh&quot; for letter Shin and &quot;Zh&quot; for letter Zhe also cause problems as they could be interpreted as the letter Sin and &#x27;Choti He&#x27; or letter Ze and &#x27;Choti He&#x27; respectively. Most Roman Urdu schemes also do not take much consideration of Urdu orthography and the spelling system.

== Informal Roman Urdu ==

The system of Romanisation used most often by native speakers differs from the formal systems presented in most English language sources. It contains no diacritics or special characters, usually just the 26 letters of the core English alphabet. Informal Romanised Urdu is mutually intelligible with Romanised Hindi and the distinction between the languages can be controversial.

While the Urdu alphabet is derived from the Arabic alphabet informal Romanised Urdu is less eccentric than informal Romanised Arabic. Informal Romanised Urdu does not use numerals, and rarely uses mixed case, because the Arabic letters that lack a clear equivalent in the English Latin alphabet (e.g. ) are often silent in Urdu or pronounced identically to other letters (e.g. ). So, this system of Urdu Romanisation is used in some slightly more formal contexts than informal Romanised Arabic.

One example is the word . Formal transliterations often include a punctuation mark (&#x27;) or special character () for the ayn but this is omitted in informal romanization. Adding the special characters makes it harder to type and would cause things such as Twitter hashtags to break. The discussion on social media about these events is often in informal Romanised Urdu, with frequent code-switching between Urdu and English, but the handwritten or expertly typeset signs at the events are mostly in either English, Urdu in the traditional script, or local languages.

<text>Thomas Edgar Ball (11 February 1900 – 11 November 1923) was an English footballer who played at centre-half for Aston Villa. He was shot dead by his landlord and neighbour, ex-policeman George Stagg, thus becoming the first and to-date only active Football League player in England to have been murdered.

==Football career==
Ball was born in Chester-le-Street, County Durham in North-east England, and was brought up in nearby Usworth. He played football for his school, winning a medal as a ten-year-old. After school he worked as a coalminer, playing for various colliery teams, before being signed by Newcastle United.

He made no first-team appearances for Newcastle before moving to the West Midlands to join Aston Villa of the Football League First Division in January 1920, where he was seen as cover for Frank Barson. His first-team appearances were limited until Barson left Villa in August 1922 after which Ball became the first-choice centre-half, making 36 appearances in the 1922–23 season, at the end of which Villa finished sixth in the league table. In the following season, he continued to perform well at the heart of Villa&#x27;s defence and he was forecast to be called up to play for England.

His last game for Villa came on 10 November 1923 with a 1–0 victory at Notts County&#x27;s Meadow Lane ground; this result left Villa third in the league table. By this time, Ball had made a total of 77 appearances in league and cup matches.

==Personal life and death==
In May 1922, Ball married Beatrice Richards, the daughter of a local pork butcher and pie maker. In October, the couple moved into Somerville Cottages, on Brick Kiln Lane (now Beeches Road), Perry Barr which they rented from George Stagg, who occupied the adjoining cottage. Stagg was a former City of Birmingham Police officer who had been injured during the First World War; after the war, he had taken various factory jobs before purchasing the Brick Kiln Lane properties in 1921. The relationship between Stagg and Ball was strained, with Stagg objecting to Ball&#x27;s chickens straying into his garden; Stagg had threatened to poison the chickens and had made attempts to have Ball evicted from the cottage.

On the evening of Sunday 11 November, the day after the match at Nottingham, Ball and his wife had visited the Church Tavern where Ball drank pints of ale. They returned home late in the evening and, shortly after 10 pm Ball had gone into his garden to fetch his dog. Beatrice heard an argument in the garden followed by a gunshot. She ran out into the garden where she saw her husband &quot;in a very distressed state, reeling towards her&quot;. Beatrice claimed that Stagg shot again with the bullet passing over her shoulder. Ball died shortly afterwards from the gunshot wounds. Stagg made no attempt to flee and was arrested by the police at the scene.

Ball&#x27;s funeral was held on 19 November, and has been described as &quot;a grand occasion&quot;. The funeral cortege set off from the butcher&#x27;s shop of Beatrice Ball&#x27;s father, William Richards, in High Street, Aston; seven coaches and several cars made their way through the crowds lining the streets to the packed St. John&#x27;s Church, Perry Barr where the coffin was carried by Ball&#x27;s former teammates. There were floral tributes from local football clubs, as well as from Middlesbrough, close to his birthplace. A collection among the crowd at Aston Villa&#x27;s home match on the Saturday before the funeral raised over a hundred pounds for Ball&#x27;s widow.
Ball was buried in St. John&#x27;s churchyard in an ornate grave decorated with footballs. The grave bears the inscription: &quot;To T.E. Ball – A token of esteem from his fellow players of Aston Villa F.C.&quot; The grave&#x27;s condition deteriorated over the years but has been restored by Aston Villa supporters.

The following poem was written shortly after Ball&#x27;s murder:Twas on a Sabbath evening in drear November daysTwo friends were heard creating, in Perry Barry&#x27;s bywaysHigh words just fed the anger, now this young man&#x27;s life is fled.A shot and then another! And Thomas Ball lies dead.

==Murder trial==
At the coroner&#x27;s inquest into Ball&#x27;s death, Stagg admitted the killing but claimed it had been an accident. He claimed that he had fired the gun in order to frighten Ball and that Ball was shot as he attempted to grab the gun. The jury rejected this argument, returning a verdict of &quot;wilful murder&quot;, and Stagg was committed for trial at Stafford Assizes.

The murder trial was heard in February 1924 in front of Mr. Justice Rowlatt. Stagg continued to claim that the killing was an accident and that he first fired the gun when Ball (allegedly &quot;under the influence of drink&quot;) started to climb over the gate following an argument. There then followed a fight where Ball tried to wrench the gun away from Stagg; as Stagg fell back, the gun discharged accidentally, killing Ball. Stagg also claimed that Ball had threatened to attack Mrs. Stagg who was watching from a first-floor window: &quot;I will come up and dash your brains out&quot; and that Beatrice Ball had later said &quot;He would not have hurt Mrs. Stagg, although he kicks me about&quot;. This was refuted at the trial by Mrs. Ball who &quot;emphatically denied&quot; that her husband had ever hit her. The Aston Villa trainer, Alf Miles, was called as a witness saying that Ball was a &quot;good living man – always in the best of condition&quot;.

In his summing up, Mr. Justice Rowlatt instructed the jury not to show too much sympathy towards Stagg, but &quot;to look at the facts dispassionately&quot;. Although there was a conflict of evidence as to how Ball was killed and although there might have been no motive, &quot;it might still be murder if a man might lose his temper against a person he did not like and commit an act of murder&quot;. If the gun was pointed at the victim and discharged on purpose, that was murder, whereas if it went off by accident during a struggle, that was manslaughter. After deliberating for an hour and forty minutes, the jury returned a verdict of &quot;wilful murder&quot; with a recommendation of mercy. Despite this, Mr. Justice Rowlatt passed a sentence of death.

Stagg was refused leave to appeal, but his sentence was commuted to life imprisonment as part of the reforms introduced by the newly elected Labour Government. Stagg was subsequently declared &quot;insane&quot; and was incarcerated in Broadmoor Hospital. He eventually died in a Birmingham mental hospital in February 1966, aged 87.

<text>Hristo Botev (, ), born Hristo Botyov Petkov (Христо Ботьов Петков; – ), was a Bulgarian revolutionary and poet. Botev is considered by Bulgarians to be a symbolic historical figure and national hero. His poetry is a prime example of the literature of the Bulgarian National Revival, though he is considered to be ahead of his contemporaries in his political, philosophical, and aesthetic views.

Botev was born in Kalofer, Bulgaria, to Botyo Petkov and Ivanka Boteva. His father was a teacher in Odessa and a significant figure of the late period of the Bulgarian National Revival. Botev attended the local three-class school and later attended a high school in Odessa. He left high school in 1865 and spent two years teaching in Odessa and Bessarabia. Botev tried to send his son to study in the Russian Empire with the help of Nayden Gerov, but was only allowed to attend the Second Grammar School as a volunteer. He found it difficult to fit in and was often absent from lessons and treated teachers with arrogance. In 1864, he left the boarding school and began living independently in various lodgings. Botev spent time in libraries, particularly the Bulgarian library Yuriy Venelin, where he read mainly Russian authors and became acquainted with philologist Victor Grigorovich. He worked on his poem &quot;To My Mother&quot; in the summer of 1864 and sent it to Petko Slaveykov in Constantinople. When it became apparent that Botev was failing the gymnasium&#x27;s third grade and was expelled for &quot;carelessness,&quot; his scholarship was cancelled and he was given a lump sum to travel back to Bulgaria. Botev was sent by his father to Odessa to resume his education. He decided to go to Romania instead, arriving in Giurgiu in September 1867. He met with Bulgarian émigrés and met Vasil Levski, the leader of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee. Botev worked as a teacher in Bessarabia and became editor of the revolutionary emigrant newspaper &quot;Word of the Bulgarian Emigrants&quot;. He was imprisoned for months due to his collaboration with Russian revolutionaries.

The Bulgarian revolutionary movement faced danger after the capture of Vasil Levski by Ottoman authorities in 1872. The BRCC split into two factions: Botev and his supporters supported immediate uprising preparations, while moderate revolutionaries, led by Lyuben Karavelov, believed it was too early. In 1876, Bulgarian revolutionary émigrés in Romania believed a general armed uprising against Ottoman occupation was imminent and decided to organize an armed company to cross the Danube. Botev took overall command of the company, which later became the main reason for the Russian-Turkish war and Bulgaria&#x27;s Liberation from the Ottoman Empire. Military expertise was provided by Nikola Voinovski, a graduate of the Nicholas General Staff Academy. Botev devised a plan to cross into Ottoman territory without immediately alerting Romanian or Ottoman authorities. The rebels boarded the Austro-Hungarian passenger steamship Radetzky and seized control. The Ottoman military machine, including regular army garrisons and irregular bashi-bazouks, was mobilized and patrolled the area. On 20 May 1876, a single bullet hit Botev in the chest, killing him instantly. The cheta suffered a drop in morale and began to disperse, with most members captured, imprisoned, or executed. In total, 130 cheta members were killed, with most evading capture or death. The incident is traditionally commemorated on 2 June.

==Early life==
=== Family background and childhood ===
Botev was born on in Kalofer. The birthplace is disputed by several historians, stating that he was born in Karlovo (according to the letter of Nayden Gerov) or the small village of Osen. His father was Botyo Petkov and his mother was Ivanka Boteva.

His father&#x27;s backstory is that he was a teacher in Odessa and one of the most significant figures of the late period of the Bulgarian National Revival towards the end of the Ottoman occupation. His mother was born in a modest Kalofer family. Botev was not the only child in the family, he was together with his eight siblings, which were Ana, Petko, Stefan, Kiril, Tota, Genko, Genko and Boyan.

According to some sources, Hristo Botev was born in a room of the Kalofer school where his parents lived. A little later, a new school was built in Kalofer and the family rented a house from Genko Filov, where Botev spent the first years of his life. This house was destroyed during the 1877-1878 Russo-Turkish War, but in the 1940s it was rebuilt and turned into the Hristo Botev National Museum.

=== Education ===
In 1854, Botyo Petkov failed to reach an agreement with the Kalofer municipality about his salary and moved to Karlovo. There the family lived in his mother&#x27;s house in Tabashka Mahala, and Hristo Botev went to school with his father as his teacher. In 1858, Botyo Petkov accused the administration of the Karlovo municipality of embezzling money that had been bequeathed to the school and then returned to Kalofer. The municipality tried unsuccessfully to accommodate him in a house belonging to the merchant Hristo Tupchilestov, who lived in Constantinople, whereupon the family moved into the house of Hadzhi Nestor. After returning to Kalofer, Hristo Botev attended the local three-class school, where his father was a teacher. In 1863, after completing his primary school education in Kalofer, Botev was sent by his father to a high school in Odessa.

As early as 1857, Botyo Petkov tried to send his son to study in the Russian Empire with the help of Nayden Gerov, an acquaintance from Odessa who had become a well-known pedagogue and Russian vice-consul in Plovdiv. This was only possible in Autumn 1863, when Hristo Botev received a scholarship from the Russian government and travelled via Plovdiv and Constantinople to Odessa, where he arrived on 14 November. In Odessa, Hristo Botev turned to the Bulgarian Board of Trustees of Odessa, to whom he was able to present a letter of recommendation from Naiden Gerov, and to its member Nikola Toshkovich, a wealthy merchant born in Kalofer, who was an acquaintance of his father. He entered the Second Grammar School as a &quot;volunteer&quot;, as he was not well enough prepared to be a regular student, and was placed in the boarding school, where there were ten other Bulgarian students at the time.

From the moment he entered high school, Botev found it difficult to fit in - he constantly complained about the strict discipline, which included corporal punishment, but at the same time he was often absent from lessons, got into fights with classmates and treated most of his teachers with arrogance. In 1864, he left the boarding school and began to live independently in various lodgings. Despite his father&#x27;s insistent letters and Nikola Toshkov&#x27;s attempts to influence him, he neglected school and alienated the Bulgarians in Odessa with his eccentric behaviour, many of whose representatives restricted their contacts with him.

Although he did not attend school often, Botev spent a lot of time in various libraries, especially in the Bulgarian library Yuriy Venelin, which was located in Toshkov&#x27;s house. He read mainly Russian authors and was particularly impressed by Nikolay Chernyshevsky and Ivan Turgenev. He became acquainted with the philologist Victor Grigorovich, whom he assisted in translating Bulgarian folk tunes into Russian. According to his classmate Kiro Tuleshkov, Botev was already working on his poem &quot;Mother&quot; in the summer of 1864, consulting Grigorovich, and sent it to Petko Slaveykov in Constantinople even then. The reliability of this information is not clear, as the poem was not published by Slaveykov until several years later.

When it became apparent in September 1865 that Botev was failing the gymnasium&#x27;s third grade and was expelled for &quot;carelessness,&quot; his scholarship was cancelled, and he was given a lump sum to travel back to Bulgaria. Still, he stayed in Odessa, earning a living through private instruction and keeping in touch with the city&#x27;s Polish population. Botev even registered as a &quot;volunteer&quot; at the Historical and Philological Faculty of the Imperial Novorossiya University with the help of Grigorovich.

=== Return to Kalofer ===
Following his arrival in Kalofer, Botev took over for his ill dad by attending some of his lessons. At that time, on April 15, Hristo Botev&#x27;s poem &quot;To My Mother&quot; was published for the first time in the journal &quot;Gaida&quot; which was published in Constantinople and was edited by Petko Slaveykov. The poem was published without a recognised author. During the May 11 observance of the Day of the Holy Brothers Cyril and Methodius, Botev delivered an impromptu speech criticising the national movement&#x27;s moderation, which at the time was primarily focused on the creation of an independent church. Police threats were raised by the speech, but none materialised. Botev frequently visited Parashkeva Shushulova, a teacher at the nearby girls&#x27; school, during his time in Kalofer. She is said to be the most likely prototype for the beloved in some of his poetry.

== Emigrant in Romania ==
Hristo Botev was sent by his father after getting better from the illness to Odessa once again to resume his education. Using his father&#x27;s money to get to Constantinople and then Odessa, he doesn&#x27;t follow that and without informing his parents, decides to go to Romania. Hristo Botev arrived in Giurgiu, at the end of September 1867. There, he quickly made contact with Bulgarian émigrés, including Hadzhi Dimitar and several members of the cheta that Filip Totyu and Panayot Hitov had formed that previous year. Following the announcement of the death of famed revolutionary Georgi Rakovski, they travelled to Bucharest to attend his burial on 12 October 1867. Lacking any money, Botev went to Georgi Atanasovich, who gave him the money he needed to continue on his way to Odessa. He resumed his trip to Odessa, which was then unfinished and stopped in Brăila. There, he began working as a word-editor and published his second elegy &quot;To your brother&quot;.

For some time he lived in an abandoned mill near Bucharest with Vasil Levski, the eventual leader of the Bulgarian Secret Resistance Committees, and the two of them initially became close friends.

From 1869 to 1871 Botev worked again as a teacher in Bessarabia, keeping close relations with the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and its leaders. In June 1871 he became editor of the revolutionary emigrant newspaper &quot;Word of the Bulgarian Emigrants&quot; (&quot;Duma na bulgarskite emigranti&quot;), where he began publishing his early poetic works. Imprisoned for some months, due to his close collaboration with the Russian revolutionaries, Botev started working for the &quot;Liberty&quot; (&quot;Svoboda&quot;) newspaper, edited by the eminent Bulgarian writer and revolutionary Lyuben Karavelov. In 1873 he also edited the satiric newspaper &quot;Alarm clock&quot; (&quot;Budilnik&quot;), where he published a number of feuilletons, aimed at those wealthy Bulgarians who did not take part in the revolutionary movement.

The Bulgarian revolutionary movement was put in danger with the capture of Vasil Levski by Ottoman authorities at the end of 1872. At the time Levski was the indisputable leader of the Bulgarian insurgency. He had established a network of revolutionary committees, supervised by the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC; In Bulgarian: БРЦК) located in Romania, which was tasked with preparing the Bulgarian revolutionaries for a future general uprising against Ottoman rule. Levski was brought to trial, sentenced to death by hanging and executed on 19 February 1873. His death was a serious blow to the morale of the revolutionary movement.

With Levski&#x27;s death the BRCC split into two factions: Botev and his supporters, including Stefan Stambolov and Panayot Hitov backed the idea that preparations should be started for an immediate uprising, while the moderate revolutionaries, led by Lyuben Karavelov, thought that it was too early for such actions. Botev intended to start an uprising at the first possible moment, to take advantage of the international situation (the mounting tension between the Ottoman Empire on one side, and Serbia and Russia on the other), and because the revolutionary network, established by Levski, was still relatively intact and could take an active part in the preparations. The revolt in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1875 inspired Botev and Stambolov to think that a rebellion should start soon in Bulgaria as well. They thought that the greater the turmoil in the Balkans, the more attention this would attract among the Great Powers. In the beginning of August 1875 Karavelov, already quite ill, stepped down as president of BRCC, and Botev was elected the new president. Thinking that the Bulgarian people were ever ready for a rebellion, he believed no careful preparations were needed.

== Cheta and death ==
In the April Uprising of 1876, an experienced leader recruited to command the Liberation of Bulgaria (known as voivoda) refused for political reasons. Botev himself took overall command of the company, which later on became the main reason for the Russo-Turkish war and Bulgaria&#x27;s liberation from the Ottoman Empire. Military expertise was provided by Nikola Voinovski (1849–1876).

Botev devised an ingenious plan for crossing into Ottoman territory without immediately alerting either the Romanian or the Ottoman authorities. The rebels, disguised as gardeners, boarded in groups at the Romanian ports of Zimnicea, Turnu Măgurele, Corabia, Bechet the Austro-Hungarian passenger steamship Radetzky. When the last group boarded at Bechet the rebels retrieved their concealed weapons and seized control of the ship (this incident was later commemorated in a popular poem and song).

The company almost immediately became the focus of incessant bashi-bazouk attacks. Voinovski displayed some excellent defensive tactics helped by the still high morale and discipline of the company. On 18 May the massing bashi-bazouks caught up with the company in force, and Botev had to go to ground on the Milin Kamak Hill some 50 km from the Danube. 

The next day passed without sighting the enemy, but at this point it was obvious that no local reinforcements could be expected. On the morning of 20 May Julian, sentries detected advancing bashi-bazouks and 5 companies of regular Ottoman troops. The men immediately took strong positions near Mount Okoltchitza. The defense was divided into two sectors, one commanded by Voinovski and the other by Botev.

==Literary works==

In 1875 Botev published his poetic works in a book called &quot;Songs and Poems&quot;, together with his close associate Bulgarian revolutionary poet and future politician and statesman, Stefan Stambolov. Botev&#x27;s poetry reflected the sentiments of the poor people, filled with revolutionary ideas, struggling for their freedom against both foreign and domestic tyrants. His poetry was influenced by the Russian revolutionary democrats and the figures of the Paris Commune. Under this influence, Botev rose both as a poet and a revolutionary democrat. Many of his poems are imbued with revolutionary zeal and determination, such as &quot;My Prayer&quot; (&quot;Moyata molitva&quot;), &quot;At Farewell&quot; (&quot;Na proshtavane&quot;), &quot;Hajduks&quot; (&quot;Haiduti&quot;), &quot;In the Tavern&quot; (&quot;V mehanata&quot;), and &quot;Struggle&quot; (&quot;Borba&quot;). Others are romantic, balladic (&quot;Hadzhi Dimitar&quot;).

==Legacy==

In 1885 a commemoration committee was founded on the anniversary of Botev&#x27;s death, 20 May/1 June. A monument was erected on the main square of Vratsa in 1890 in the presence of King Ferdinand. Some of the most prominent Bulgarians in the history of the newly independent country, such as Stefan Stambolov and Zahari Stoyanov, devoted much attention to Botev and his deeds for Bulgaria.

Among places and entities named after Botev is the football club PFC Botev Plovdiv.

<text>Robert Harper (28 January 1944 – 28 October 2020), known professionally as Bobby Ball, was a British comic, actor, singer and television host. He was best known as a member of the comic double act Cannon and Ball, with Tommy Cannon (Thomas Derbyshire).

They hosted their own ITV show, &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot;, for nine years between 1979 and 1988. Ball then went on to have acting roles in various sitcoms and dramas including &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Not Going Out&quot;. In 2005, Ball took part in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

==Early life==
Ball was born at Boundary Park General Hospital in Oldham, Lancashire, on 28 January 1944, to May (née Savage) and Bob Harper. He attended Crompton House C of E school, Shaw, Oldham, and briefly studied Shipping Management at Wigan Mining &amp; Technical College before going to work in a factory as a welder, where he also met his future partner in comedy, Thomas Derbyshire (Tommy Cannon).

==Career==
===Cannon and Ball===

Ball was one half of comedy duo Cannon and Ball, opposite his friend and colleague Tommy Cannon. The duo&#x27;s primetime Saturday night television series &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot;, was one of LWT&#x27;s most successful series, with consistently high viewing ratings that lasted for nine years. They starred in the film &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot; together in 1982 and guest starred in the Eric Sykes slapstick film, &quot;Mr H Is Late&quot;, in 1988. Other notable guest appearances were &quot;The Kenny Everett Television Show&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; in 1996.

Cannon and Ball competed in the fifth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and in 2011, Cannon and Ball were guest judges on one episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Show Me the Funny&quot;.

===Television===
Ball was the creator of the ITV children&#x27;s cartoon series &quot;Military Style!&quot;, which aired in 1990, and the BBC children&#x27;s cartoon series &quot;Juniper Jungle&quot;, which aired in 1992. He played Mr. Turner (also known as Topsy Turner) in the ITV drama series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; from 2005 to 2006. From 2005 to 2008, he played Lenny in the BBC series &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. In 2009, Ball starred in the comedy &quot;The Fattest Man in Britain&quot; playing Morris Morrissey.

In 2009, Ball was cast as Frank in the long-running BBC One sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot;. Ball made his final appearance as Frank in the eleventh season, which began airing in January 2021, and was filmed a few weeks before his death.

From 2011 to 2017, Ball played Barry in the Sky1 sitcom series &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;. The following year, he took part in BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; alongside Cannon. His second appearance on the show was for a &quot;Children in Need&quot; special in November 2013 with Lee Mack.

In 2013, Ball played the role of Duckers in the ITV sitcom pilot &quot;The Security Men&quot;, starring alongside the likes of Brendan O&#x27;Carroll and Paddy McGuinness. The episode, written by Caroline Aherne and Jeff Pope, was later not picked up for a full series. Cannon and Ball appeared in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Last Laugh in Vegas&quot; in 2018. Cannon and Ball have also previously starred in the Safestyle UK television advertisements.

In November 2019, he played the regular character Ray, stepdad to Joe Wilkinson&#x27;s character Simon, in &quot;The Cockfields&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ball married his first wife, Joan Lynn, in 1964, with whom he had two sons, Robert (born 1965) and Darren (born 1969), who are now a comedy double act in their own right, performing under their surname &#x27;Harper&#x27;. Ball and Lynn separated in 1970.

Ball married his second wife, Yvonne Nugent, in 1974. In an interview on BBC Tees on 28 June 2016, Ball said that he met Yvonne while performing with Cannon at a club in Norton, County Durham: &quot;We were playing there ... she came downstairs in a little mini skirt, looked at me and Tommy, shook her head and walked away. I thought, &#x27;I&#x27;d spend my life with her.&#x27;&quot;

Ball and his wife lived in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. Together they had a daughter Joanne born in 1972.

By 1983, Ball&#x27;s friendship with Cannon had deteriorated and the pair did not speak to each other outside of rehearsals and performances. In 1986, while working at the Bradford Alhambra, Ball began talking with chaplain Max Wigley. Ball said: &quot;I got talking to him and attacked him verbally about God. But he had a peace about him. I can&#x27;t explain exactly what he had but he had something that I didn&#x27;t have. One day I asked to speak to him and after a while he said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s pray.&#x27; I&#x27;d never prayed in my life but we prayed and it just changed my life – like that [he snaps his fingers].&quot; Shortly afterward Ball became a Christian, which helped re-kindle his broken friendship with Cannon. Cannon became a Christian in 1992, with the pair publishing a book called &quot;Christianity for Beginners&quot;. They regularly featured in their own gospel and &quot;An audience with...&quot; show in churches around the country. He also taught vicars and clergy how to incorporate humour into sermons.

He published an autobiography, entitled &quot;My Life&quot;, in 1993.

He was a supporter of the Variety Children&#x27;s Charity, presiding over the organization&#x27;s ceremonies and appearing in fundraising events. He received a lifetime achievement honor from Variety, in 2018.

==Death==
Ball died at the Victoria Hospital in Blackpool, on 28 October 2020, aged 76 from Covid-19. A small tribute was paid to Ball after the closing credits of the 2021 New Year&#x27;s special of &quot;Not Going Out&quot;, which was the first episode broadcast after his death, before another tribute (a compilation of past scenes featuring his character) that was shown in the final episode of Series 11, which was the final episode recorded before his death.

<text>Thomas Derbyshire (born 27 June 1938), known professionally as Tommy Cannon, is an English comic, actor and singer. He is best known as the straight man of the comic double act Cannon and Ball, until Bobby Ball&#x27;s death in 2020, in TV programmes such as &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot;.

==Cannon and Ball==

Cannon was one half of comedy duo Cannon and Ball opposite his friend and colleague Bobby Ball (real name Robert Harper) before his death. They first appeared on television in 1968 on the talent show &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot;. The duo&#x27;s prime-time Saturday-night television series &quot;The Cannon and Ball Show&quot; was one of LWT&#x27;s most successful series, with consistently high viewing ratings over 12 years. They starred in the film &quot;The Boys in Blue&quot; together in 1982 and guest-starred in the Eric Sykes slapstick film &quot;Mr H is Late&quot; in 1988. Other notable guest appearances were on &quot;The Kenny Everett Television Show&quot; in 1982 and &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; in 1996.

On 28 October 2020, Cannon&#x27;s comedy partner Bobby Ball died at Blackpool Victoria Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19.

==Television==
In late 2005, Cannon and Ball appeared in the fifth series of reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;.

In 2012, Cannon and Ball appeared in the third celebrity series of &quot;Coach Trip&quot;.

Cannon and Ball star in the Safestyle UK television advertisements. He made a one-off guest appearance in the 2014 Christmas special of &quot;Not Going Out&quot; on BBC One.

Cannon was cast in ITV soap opera &quot;Emmerdale&quot; as pensioner Derek in 2019. He appears in several episodes and features in a story that has &quot;serious consequences&quot; for regular characters. The character was killed off at the conclusion of Cannon&#x27;s guest stint.

==Personal life==
Cannon&#x27;s first marriage was to Margaret; they had two daughters, Jeanette (born 1961) and Julie (1964). The couple later divorced in 1993. They split up in 1987 but Margaret would not give Tommy a divorce. He lives in York with his second wife Hazel who is 20 years his junior, by whom he has three children: Kelly-Anne (born 1991), Zoe Louise (born 1993) and Luke Thomas (born 1996).

Cannon served as Chairman of Rochdale Football Club for a term until 1988.

<text>&quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; is a song by American rock band Blink-182. It was released in April 1999 as the lead single from the group&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Enema of the State&quot; (1999), released through MCA Records. &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; shares writing credits between the band&#x27;s guitarist Tom DeLonge and bassist Mark Hoppus, but Hoppus was the primary composer of the song. It was the band&#x27;s first single to feature drummer Travis Barker. A mid-tempo pop-punk song, &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; is memorable for its distinctive, arpeggiated guitar intro.

The song lyrically revolves around the onset of age and maturity, and the failure to implement changes in one&#x27;s behavior. Hoppus declined to label the song as autobiographical, but admitted that he spent his twenties acting immature. The trio recorded the song with producer Jerry Finn. It was originally titled &quot;Peter Pan Complex&quot;, an allusion to the pop-psychology concept, but label MCA found the reference obscure and adjusted the title. The song&#x27;s signature music video famously features the band running nude on the streets of Los Angeles. It received heavy rotation on MTV and other music video channels.

It became one of the band&#x27;s best-performing singles, peaking at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart for 10 weeks. The song placed at number three in Italy and number 17 in the United Kingdom. Primarily an airplay hit, the song was the band&#x27;s first to cross over to pop radio, hitting number 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song received positive reviews and has been called a classic pop punk track; &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 117 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot; in 2012.

==Background and writing==

Blink-182, consisting of bassist Mark Hoppus, guitarist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Scott Raynor, formed in the early 1990s, and by the end of the decade, had reached commercial success with their second album, 1997&#x27;s &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Dammit (Growing Up)&quot;, became one of the most-played U.S. modern rock hits of 1998, sending its parent album to a gold certification and bringing the members newfound notoriety and wealth. With his first advance from major-label MCA, Hoppus purchased a home in the band&#x27;s hometown of San Diego, California. Hoppus developed &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; while sitting on the floor and playing guitar in his kitchen/living room. He was attempting to play the song &quot;J.A.R.&quot; by Green Day, which has a distinctive intro on bass guitar. While practicing playing the riff, Hoppus came up with a new song derived from his failure to perform the part correctly.

Though he initially developed it as a vulgar joke song, he felt it had potential as a regular tune. Hoppus claims it took him five minutes to write. He later presented the song to the band while rehearsing at DML Studios in Escondido, California, where they had booked time for two weeks to write new songs. Earlier that year, Raynor had been expelled from the group and replaced with percussionist Travis Barker, previously of the ska-punk act the Aquabats. He and DeLonge found the composition agreeable and further developed it in the rehearsal space. The story in the song is not strictly autobiographical, but its central theme resonated with Hoppus, who spent his twenties by his own admission &quot;acting like a jackass teenager&quot;. Barker agreed, later commenting: &quot;[Mark] was a grown man but kept acting like a kid.&quot; Many Blink songs center on maturity—&quot;more specifically, their lack of it, their attitude toward their lack of it, or their eventual wide-eyed exploration of it&quot; according to writer Nitsuh Abebe.

==Composition==

&quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; is credited to Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus. Though Barker helped write the songs on &quot;Enema of the State&quot;, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not an official band member. The song is two minutes and twenty-eight seconds long. The song is composed in the key of G-flat major and is set in time signature of common time with a driving tempo of 158 beats per minute. Hoppus&#x27; vocal range spans from Db3 to Gb4. It follows a I–V–vi–IV chord progression, common across several genres of music. The band utilize the progression in numerous other singles; music educator and author Dan Bennett claims the progression is sometimes called the &quot;pop-punk progression&quot; because of its frequent use in the genre. The song is incredibly brief compared to most singles; within one minute, nearly two full verses and a chorus have been completed, and it in total runs two minutes and twenty-six seconds.

===Instrumentation===
The song opens with an arpeggiated guitar hook, following the song&#x27;s chord progression in playing the root notes of each chord. The part has been considered tricky to perform; given its quick, articulated nature, it can be difficult to skip over the strings properly. Hoppus&#x27;s bass line, which has been compared to the Pixies&#x27; song &quot;Debaser&quot;, also situates on the roots of each chord. The song utilizes power chords in its chorus, and substitutes the arpeggiated intro for palm-muted power chords in the succeeding verse.

===Lyrics===
The song&#x27;s first verse details an intimate relationship gone awry. Hoppus sings of wearing cologne in hopes to impress a girl on a weekend date. Upon returning home, foreplay ensues, during which the protagonist begins watching television. This prompts his insulted partner to leave, leading into the song&#x27;s chorus, in which Hoppus sings that &quot;nobody likes you when you&#x27;re 23.&quot; Hoppus was 26 when he wrote the song, and only included the lyric to rhyme.

Each chorus is lyrically distinct, which was one of Hoppus&#x27;s original goals; he felt this approach kept the song interesting and advanced the story in a creative way. Hoppus had once read that &quot;the best art is the evolution of familiarity&quot;: an artist introduces an idea, a listener connects with it, and the artist slightly alters the original idea to retain a familiar feeling.

==Recording and production==

After further development, the group presented it to producer Jerry Finn. A veteran engineer, Finn came to fame mixing Green Day&#x27;s breakthrough album &quot;Dookie&quot; (1994). Finn was suggested by major label MCA as an option for producing &quot;Enema of the State&quot;; the band got along with him immediately, and continued to work with him on their future projects. Finn would suggest and make adjustments where necessary, though in the case of &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, he had little notes. By the time Hoppus presented the song to his bandmates, the first verse and chorus were written, with its second verse and bridge section needing further work. Hoppus and DeLonge crafted an instrumental bridge that went on for eight measures, which all agreed felt too long. Finn assisted in shortening the section, and the group recorded a demo at DML Studios.

Within the new year, the group recorded the song proper. The drums on &quot;Enema of the State&quot; were tracked at Mad Hatter Studios in North Hollywood, a space once owned by jazz musician Chick Corea. Hoppus remembered that Finn was meticulous in recording the kit, spending hours on microphone placement, as well as picking compressors and at which rate they would run. Barker recorded his drum portions, as well as the rest of the album&#x27;s twelve songs, in eight hours. From there, Hoppus and DeLonge recorded their bass and guitar tracks at multiple studios throughout Los Angeles and San Diego. The band brought in session musician Roger Joseph Manning Jr.—best known for his career in the band Jellyfish and work with Beck—to add keyboard parts in the background of the song.

The song originally concluded after its final chorus. While recording, Hoppus liked how the arpeggiated chord progression continued over the rhythm guitar line in the last chorus, and wished to extend its length to highlight this element. In the pre-digital recording environment, this required the team to &quot;bounce&quot; the mix from the analog tape recorder (a 24 track 2-inch tape) to another tape, and splice the recordings together. With recording complete, the song was sent to engineer Tom Lord-Alge, who mixed the song at his South Beach Studios facility in Miami Beach, Florida. Lord-Alge had previously remixed the &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; singles &quot;Dammit&quot; and &quot;Josie&quot; for radio, and would work with the group frequently in the future. Lord-Alge added subtle touches, including a panning effect for the title phrase in the last chorus.

==Release and chart performance==
The working title for the song was &quot;Peter Pan Complex&quot;, referencing the popular psychology concept of an adult who is socially immature. Executives at MCA Records were uncertain that listeners would connect with the title, given it goes unmentioned in the song&#x27;s lyrics. Previously, the label had appended parentheses to its two stateside singles from &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;: &quot;Dammit (Growing Up)&quot; and &quot;Josie (Everything&#x27;s Gonna Be Fine)&quot;. The label was also concerned about litigation from the Walt Disney Company, who held rights to the name following their film adaption. The band disliked the suggestion, but given the creative freedom MCA had afforded them throughout recording, agreed to the change. Hoppus later conceded the new title made more sense and &quot;feels right&quot;. Band management and label executives saw a strong single in &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; although DeLonge felt otherwise: &quot;I didn&#x27;t understand it, because up to that point, we hadn&#x27;t had a big single.&quot;

Commercially, &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; became one of the band&#x27;s best-performing singles. It was picked as the lead single from &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. It was first serviced to radio in April 1999, and premiered on KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles alternative station. Hoppus remembered the group were finalizing mixing the album when the song debuted. The song did best on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart; the song first entered the chart during the week of May 8, where it debuted at number 21. It first hit the top five during the week of June 5, and hit number two on July 24, where it remained for ten weeks behind the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;. The song crossed over to mainstream radio in mid-1999, where it debuted at number 71 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 on July 17. It later peaked at number 58 in the issue dated October 23. The song had previously peaked at number 51 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart on September 11. In the United Kingdom, the song was released twice, first on September 20, 1999, and again on June 26, 2000, following the success of &quot;All the Small Things. The 2000 re-release peaked at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Critical reception==

Carrie Bell at &quot;Billboard&quot; deemed the song a &quot;peppy punk anthem&quot; while &quot;Spin&quot; columnist Jeffery Rotter called it an &quot;ideal tonic for back-to-school nausea.&quot; A &quot;Kerrang!&quot; writer called the song &quot;ridiculously infectious,&quot; while the &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (&quot;NME&quot;) derided the song as &quot;more mindless, punk-pop guitar thrashing from the world&#x27;s current favorite American brats ... on the plus side, the song — much like Blink-182&#x27;s career, we hope — only lasts for two-and-a-half minutes.&quot; Stephen Thompson, writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, complimented its catchy sensibility, remarking, &quot;you&#x27;ll never go broke creating an anthem for immature post-adolescents, even working within a well-worn genre.&quot;

Later reviews have subsequently been positive. Jon Blisten of Beats Per Minute deemed it one of the record&#x27;s &quot;finest songs,&quot; calling it a &quot;twisted, self-depreciating examination of man-children.&quot; In 2014, Chris Payne of &quot;Billboard&quot; called it &quot;the quintessential Blink manifesto — the story of a twenty-something who still acts like a child.&quot; The website Consequence of Sound, in a 2015 top 10 of the band&#x27;s best songs, ranked it as number six, with writer Collin Brennan observing that its title is &quot;the question underpinning the entire Blink ethos&quot;.

==Music video==
===Filming===

The music video for &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, directed by Marcos Siega, features the band running in the nude through the streets of Los Angeles, as well as through commercials and daily news programs. It was filmed shortly after completing the album, and was co-directed by Brandon PeQueen. Siega and PeQueen developed the idea from the band&#x27;s onstage antics; Barker would often strip down to his boxers due to heat, while Hoppus would sometimes disrobe entirely, with only his bass guitar covering his genitals. Siega had known the band for many years at that point, having seen them play small clubs years before. He partially credited the idea to a late-night talk show segment about a streaker. Hoppus and DeLonge were immediately receptive to the idea; Barker less so. &quot;My brain kept going to the sort of anti-establishment punk rock ethic that I associated them with. But not in an aggro way. They always came across to me as doing it with a wink,&quot; Siega later recalled.

The group wore flesh-colored Speedos for most scenes. The clip features cameo appearances by porn star Janine Lindemulder, the model featured on the cover of &quot;Enema of the State,&quot; and television personalities John Henson and Jim Rome as well as anchors from Los Angeles station KTLA as the band ran through the sets of their respective shows (Talk Soup, The Last Word with Jim Rome, and KTLA 5 News). Barker remembered that motorists &quot;kept staring at us and honking their horns,&quot; and that the entire filming took nearly fifteen hours. &quot;They almost got into accidents,&quot; Hoppus told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

===Popularity===
The video first began receiving airplay in early May 1999, debuting on U.S. television channels MTV, MTV2 and The Box. The video was MTV&#x27;s second-most played video for the week ending August 1, and remained a popular video on the channel for over two years. The video was nominated for Best Alternative Video at the 2000 MVPA Awards, but lost to Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;Learn to Fly&quot;. The band referenced the clip at the 1999 &quot;Billboard&quot; Awards, which opened with a clip of the band streaking through Las Vegas, as well as through appearances on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; and the scripted sitcom &quot;Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; writer Chris Willman called the video &quot;ubiquitous&quot;.

The video gave the band a reputation for nudity, leading many critics to pigeonhole them as a joke act. &quot;It became something of an albatross as band members grew up,&quot; wrote Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. &quot;You know, when we were filming the video for &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; the whole naked thing was only funny for like 10 minutes. Then, I was the guy standing naked on the side of the street Los Angeles with cars driving by me giving me the finger and shit. It&#x27;s funny watching the video now, but at the time, it stopped being funny ten minutes in, and it definitely wasn&#x27;t funny three days into it,&quot; recalled Tom DeLonge.

This reputation would lead the band members to take control of their marketing and image, as DeLonge later commented in 2014:

==Legacy==
&quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; has endured as among the band&#x27;s most popular songs, and has widely been considered a watershed moment for pop punk as a genre. Several of the group&#x27;s contemporaries ranked the song among the genre&#x27;s most influential, including Jack Barakat of All Time Low, Pierre Bouvier and Chuck Comeau from Simple Plan, and Tyson Ritter of the All-American Rejects. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Nicole Frehsée wrote that, &quot;For a new generation of emo fans and bands, Blink&#x27;s irreverent, upbeat take on punk rock with hits like &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot; and &quot;All the Small Things&quot; was hugely influential.&quot; Twenty years after the song&#x27;s release, Hoppus noted that fans often decorate birthday cakes on their 23rd birthday with the lyric &quot;Nobody likes you when you&#x27;re 23&quot;, which he felt was an honor. The band later paid homage to the song&#x27;s infamous video in the music video for their 2016 single &quot;She&#x27;s Out of Her Mind&quot;. The clip sees modern-day social media personalities running in the nude in Los Angeles. Lindemulder&#x27;s place in the video was taken by actor and comedian Adam DeVine.

&quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Mischa Pearlman, in a review a 2013 concert by the group, wrote that the song &quot;visibly infects every member of the audience. Because it&#x27;s a song that recalls the reckless abandon of youth, and the carelessness of growing up.&quot; Although the magazine gave the song a scathing review upon its initial release, &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 117 on its list &quot;150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years&quot; nearly thirteen years later, writing, &quot;Few songs capture the urge of wanting to act stupid and be immature as well as this 2000 single does. [...] This is everything pop punk does well. Its guitar riffs seem to have been soaked in Relentless and its chorus makes you want to jump around the room. It&#x27;s been imitated thousands of times since, but nothing&#x27;s come close to this...&quot;

By the late 2000s, club promoters in the U.K. created nights based around lasting appreciation of the pop punk genre, including one named after &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, described as a night celebrating &quot;pop-punk, youthful abandon and teenage riot&quot;. British radio station BBC Radio 1 have a section on one of their shows named after the single and using it as the theme song. Greg James originated the game on his drivetime show, and has moved it to The BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show. The game sees Greg pitted against an opponent, typically a fellow Radio 1 DJ/presenter or celebrity guest. In the game, three listeners phone in and talk to the competitors, who take it in turns to ask questions, then try to guess the listeners&#x27; age.

On March 26, 2019, the song was lauded by Princeton professor of music Steven Mackey during an interview between Hoppus and Mackey given at Princeton University. Mackey praised the lyrics by saying, &quot;it&#x27;s very much this portrait of this kind of 23 year old... Peter Pan complex&quot;, noting his enjoyment of the structure of the song, as well as its tone. Mackey stated, &quot;after the second chorus there&#x27;s this instrumental break. And there&#x27;s a lot of instrumental breaks in blink, which I really like. This one in particular, it goes to a minor key. All of a sudden, it&#x27;s kind of melancholy. And when they come out of that instrumental break, and I hear the rest of the words, it&#x27;s sort of like... I feel like, wow, was that a moment of reflection? And then it&#x27;s like, &#x27;Ah, fuck it. Whatever.&#x27; It has that feeling. It sort of deepens it for me.&quot;

In 2023, the song was used in the trailer for the reboot of Clone High.

In 2024, the song was later included in &quot;Fortnite&quot; in &quot;Fortnite Festival&quot; as a jam track.

==Mashup==
In May 2019, the band recorded a live mashup of the song with hip hop artist Lil Wayne, to promote their joint headlining tour. The track combines &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again? and Wayne&#x27;s 2008 single &quot;A Milli&quot;. The duo later released a joint digital single featuring a studio version of the mashup in August of that year. The track features Matt Skiba, who replaced founding guitarist Tom DeLonge in 2015, performing backing vocals and guitar. A press release promoted the new version, which was released to promote the second leg of the aforementioned tour, as a &quot;new take on the track.&quot;

<doc id="1112523" wikidata="Q631304" url="?curid=1112523" title="Filippo Pacini">
<text>Filippo Pacini (25 May 1812 – 9 July 1883) was an Italian anatomist, posthumously famous for isolating the cholera bacterium &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; in 1854, well before Robert Koch&#x27;s more widely accepted discoveries 30 years later.

Pacini was born in Pistoia, Tuscany, to Francesco, a humble cobbler, and Umiltà Dolfi, but was given a religious education in hopes that he would become a bishop. However, in 1830, he was given a scholarship to the most venerable medical school in Pistoia. He learned his job as a doctor and how to examine and dissect dead bodies under a microscope.

In 1831, during a dissection class, Pacini discovered small sensory organs in the nervous system which can detect pressure and vibrations. He studied them closely from 1833 on, and first discussed them in 1835 at the &quot;Società medico-fisica&quot; in Florence, but did not publish his research (&quot;Nuovi organi scoperti nel corpo umano&quot;) until 1840. Within just a few years, the work was widely known in Europe and the bodies had become known as Pacinian corpuscles.

He served as an assistant to Paolo Savi in Pisa from 1840 to 1843, then began working at the Institute of Human Anatomy. He was professor of anatomy at the University of Pisa from 1844 to 1846. In 1847, Pacini began teaching at the Lyceum in Florence, and then was named chair of General and Topographic Anatomy at the &quot;Istituto di Studi Superiori&quot; at the University of Florence in 1849, where he remained to the end of his career.

The Asiatic cholera pandemic of 1846-63 was the time period when Pacini made his discovery of the cholera bacillus. Cholera came to Florence in 1854 during what is now known as the third cholera pandemic. Pacini became very interested in the disease. Immediately following the death of cholera patients, he performed an autopsy and with his microscope, conducted histological examinations of the intestinal mucosa. During such studies, Pacini discovered a comma-shaped bacillus which he described as a Vibrio. He published a paper in 1854 entitled, &quot;Microscopical observations and pathological deductions on cholera&quot; in which he described the organism and its relation to the disease. His microscopic slides of the organism were clearly labeled, identifying the date and nature of his investigations (see figure). But because of the prevailing belief of Italian scientists in the miasma theory of disease, the work was not noted by others until many years after his death, despite additional publications in 1865, 1866, 1871, 1876, and 1880 which identified the cause of the disease&#x27;s lethality, and even proposed some effective treatments. John Snow, who disproved the miasma theory, and Robert Koch, were widely and erroneously credited with the discovery of the bacillum 30 years later. Pacini&#x27;s work was repeatedly published and readily available to the international scientific community via the English translation published in The British and Foreign Medico-chirurgical Review, Volume 38, July 1866. Also in 1854, the Catalan Joaquim Balcells i Pascual discovered the cholera bacterium.

When Koch, a much more widely respected scientist who had previously identified the tuberculosis bacillus, presented his findings to the Cholera Commission of the Imperial Health Office in Berlin in 1884, the commission congratulated him, but also recognized Pacini&#x27;s previous discovery of the bacterium. In 1965, the international committee on nomenclature adopted the formal name &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; Pacini 1854 to honor his work.

During his career, Pacini also published several studies on the retina of the human eye, the electric organs in electric fishes, the structure of bone, and the mechanics of respiration.

Pacini spent most of the money remaining after his scientific investigations on the long-term care of his two ailing sisters, Assunta and Maria Giustina. He died nearly penniless in Florence on July 9, 1883, and was buried in the cemetery of the Misericordia. In 1935, his remains were transferred to the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Pistoia, along with the remains of Atto Tigri and Filippo Civinini, two other noted anatomists.

<doc id="1112531" wikidata="Q386260" url="?curid=1112531" title="African philosophy">
<text>African philosophy is the philosophical discourse produced using indigenous African thought systems. African philosophers are found in the various academic fields of present philosophy, such as metaphysics, epistemology, moral philosophy, and political philosophy. It discusses substantive issues from an African perspective. 

African philosophy before the 20th century was primarily conducted and transmitted orally as ideas by philosophers whose names have been lost to history. While early African intellectual history primarily focused on folklore, wise sayings, and religious ideas, it also included philosophical concepts, such as the Nguni Bantu concept of Ubuntu in moral philosophy. Ubuntu, often summarized by the phrase &quot;I am because we are,&quot; emphasizes the interconnectedness of individuals within a community. It contrasts with Western individualism by prioritizing communal values and the well-being of the group over the individual, and is reminiscent of the wider phenomenon of African communalism found across the continent.

African philosophy includes but often differs from Africana philosophy in that African philosophy usually focuses on indigenous knowledge systems and philosophical traditions native to the African continent. In contrast, Africana philosophy addresses the philosophical concerns, experiences, and identities of Africans in the diaspora, particularly in regions outside Africa such as the Americas and the Caribbean.

One particular subject that several modern African philosophers have written about is on the subject of freedom and what it means to be free or to experience wholeness.

Philosophy in Africa has a rich and varied history, some of which has been lost over time. Some of the world&#x27;s oldest philosophical texts have been produced in Ancient Egypt, written in Hieratic and on papyrus, 2200–1000 BCE. One of the earliest known African philosophers was Ptahhotep, an ancient Egyptian philosopher.

A philosophical tradition of Islamic scholarship emerged in medieval African kingdoms such as Mali, Ghana and Songhai. In the seventeenth century, a philosophical literature developed in Ethiopia in relation to theodicy, principle of ethics and psychology under the philosopher Zera Yacob, and that of his disciple Walda Heywat.&quot;

In the 21st century, research by Egyptologists has indicated that the word &quot;philosopher&quot; itself seems to stem from Egypt: &quot;the founding Greek word &quot;philosophos&quot;, lover of wisdom, is itself a borrowing from and translation of the Egyptian concept &quot;mer-rekh&quot; (&quot;mr-rḫ&quot;) which literally means &#x27;lover of wisdom,&#x27; or knowledge.&quot; In the early and mid-twentieth century, anti-colonial movements had a tremendous effect on the development of a distinct modern African political philosophy that had resonance on both the continent and in the African diaspora. One well-known example of the economic philosophical works emerging from this period was the African socialist philosophy of Ujamaa propounded in Tanzania and other parts of Southeast Africa. These African political and economic philosophical developments also had a notable impact on the anti-colonial movements of many non-African peoples around the world.

==Definition==
There is some debate in defining the ethnophilosophical parameters of African philosophy and identifying what differentiates it from other philosophical traditions. One of the implicit assumptions of ethnophilosophy is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world. In &quot;A Discourse on African Philosophy: A New Perspective on Ubuntu and Transitional Justice in South Africa&quot;, Christian B. N. Gade argues that the ethnophilosophical approach to African philosophy as a static group property is highly problematic. His research on ubuntu presents an alternative collective discourse on African philosophy that takes differences, historical developments, and social contexts seriously. According to Edwin Etieyibo and Jonathon O. Chimakonam in their article “African Philosophy: Past, Present, and Future”, historical context plays an important role in African philosophy. History provides the framework in which we can inspect philosophical problems. In terms of African philosophy, one must look at the whole picture through the lens of African history. “There are no facts without history.&quot;

African philosophy can be formally defined as a critical thinking by Africans on their experiences of reality. Nigerian born Philosopher K.C. Anyanwu defined African philosophy as &quot;that which concerns itself with the way in which African people of the past and present make sense of their destiny and of the world in which they live.

Nigerian philosopher Joseph I. Omoregbe broadly defines a philosopher as one who attempts to understand the world&#x27;s phenomena, the purpose of human existence, the nature of the world, and the place of human beings in that world. This form of natural philosophy is identifiable in Africa even before individual African philosophers can be distinguished in the sources. Like Western philosophy, African philosophy contemplates the perceptions of time, personhood, space and other subjects.

== History ==
There is a rich and written history of ancient African philosophy - for example from ancient Egypt, Ethiopia, and Mali (Timbuktutu, Djenne). In general, the ancient Greeks acknowledged their Egyptian forebears, and in the fifth century BCE, the philosopher Isocrates declared that the earliest Greek thinkers traveled to Egypt to seek knowledge; one of them Pythagoras of Samos, who &quot;was first to bring to the Greeks all philosophy&quot;. When it comes to the modern era and the 20th century, a new beginning is linked to the 1920s, when African individuals who had studied in the United States and Europe (&quot;Western&quot; locations) returned to Africa and reflected on the racial discrimination experienced abroad. Their arrival back in Africa instigated a feeling of &quot;onuma&quot;, which is an interpretation of &quot;frustration.&quot; The onuma was felt in response to legacies of colonialism on a global scale. The renaissance of African philosophy in the 20th century is important because &quot;onuma&quot; inspired some who had traveled and returned to formulate a &quot;systematic beginning&quot; of philosophizing the African identity, the space of African people in history, and African contribution to humanity.

== Criteria ==
According to some, two conflicting components are deemed integral to a work for it to be considered African philosophy. First, the piece must have a racial focus. This facet is valued by Traditionalist groups, who posit that African philosophy should be an expression of the world experienced by African individuals. African philosophy must be produced by African authors. In contrast, Universalist groups suggest that African philosophy should be analyses and critical engagement of and between individual African thinkers. A work is African philosophy based on a focal point of tradition. African philosophy must pull from African cultural backgrounds or thought processes, but it should be independent from racial considerations and use &quot;African&quot; only as a term of solidarity.

== Methods ==

=== Communitarian method ===
The communitarian method of African philosophy emphasizes mutualism in thought. It is most commonly used by researchers following ubuntu. The common expression of ubuntu is that &quot;a person is a person through a person.&quot; Leonhard Praeg, Mogobe Ramose, and Fainos Mangera implement the communitarian method.

=== Complementary method ===
The complementary method focuses on the prospect of a missing link. All variables are important in consideration of histories and identities, and no variable should be overlooked or under-considered. Additionally, all variables affect one another, so the relationship between them and their affects on other variables should be scrutinized. Mesembe Edet implements the complementary method.

=== Conversational method ===
The conversational method creates thought by assessing a relationship between oppositional works. The defender or proponent is named &quot;nwa-swa,&quot; and the nwa swa is questioned and doubted by a disagreeing party, known as &quot;nwa nju.&quot; The conversational method emphasizes the interconnectedness of networks within reality; the more accurate a thought should be, the more specific a location should be. This method is endorsed by the Conventional School of Psychology, and it is used by Victor Nweke and Msembe Edet.

==Early philosophy by region==

===Pre-modern===
====North Africa====
In North Africa, arguably central to the development of the ancient Egyptian philosophical tradition of Egypt and Sudan was the conception of &quot;ma&#x27;at&quot;, which roughly translated refers to &#x27;justice&#x27;, &#x27;truth&#x27;, or simply &#x27;that which is right&#x27;. One of the earliest works of political philosophy was &quot;The Maxims of Ptahhotep&quot;, which were taught to Egyptian schoolboys for centuries.

Ancient Egypt have several philosophical texts that have been treated by scholars in recent years. In the 2018 podcast &quot;Africana Philosophy&quot;, the philosophers Peter Adamson and Chike Jeffers devoted the first eight episodes to Egyptian philosophy. The American Philosophical Association (APA) has published a text on the classical text &quot;The Immortality of Writers&quot; (&quot;Be a Writer&quot;), ca. 1200 BCE. The Blog of the APA article also covers &quot;The Dispute Between a Man and His Ba&quot; from the 19th century BCE; &quot;The Teaching of Ani&quot;, 13th century BCE, which gives advice to the ordinary man; &quot;The Satire of the Trades&quot; by Khety; and the text of Amennakht (active in 1170–1140 BCE) from Deir el-Medina, whose teaching states that &quot;it is good to finish school, better than the smell of lotus blossoms in summer&quot;.

Ancient Egyptian and other African philosophers also made important contributions to Hellenistic philosophy and Christian philosophy. According to &quot;Busiris&quot; by the ancient Greek philosopher Isocrates, who was born before Plato, &quot;all men agree the Egyptians are the healthiest and most long of life among men; and then for the soul they introduced philosophy&#x27;s training [...]&quot;. In the Hellenistic tradition, the influential philosophical school of Neoplatonism was founded by the Egyptian philosopher Plotinus in the third century CE. The Church Father and philosopher Augustine of Hippo (born in Thagaste, today&#x27;s Algeria, in 354) had a Christian mother, Saint Monica, who was an Amazigh (Berber), and Augustine defined himself as an African (or Punic, of Phoenician descent).

====West Africa====
The most prominent of West Africa&#x27;s pre-modern philosophical traditions has been identified as that of the Yoruba philosophical tradition and the distinctive worldview that emerged from it over the thousands of years of its development. Philosophical concepts such as Ifá, Omoluabi, Ashè and Emi Omo Eso were integral to this system, and the totality of its elements are contained in what is known amongst the Yoruba as the Itan. The cosmologies and philosophies of the Akan, Dogon, Serer and Dahomey were also significant.

In pre-colonial Senegambia (modern Gambia and Senegal), the 17th-century philosopher Kocc Barma Fall (b. 1586) stood out as one of the renowned philosophers in Senegambian history. His proverbs are still recited by Senegalese and Gambians alike, including in Senegambian popular culture - for example in Ousmane Sembene&#x27;s films such as &quot;Guelwaar&quot; Other notable philosophical thinkers include the Gambian historian Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof, and the Malian ethnologist Amadou Hampâté Bâ.

One of the foremost scholars of Timbuktu was Ahmed Baba (1556–1627), who argued against what he called &quot;racial slavery&quot;. One of the leading women philosophers and writers of the Sokoto Caliphate, in present-day Nigeria, was the princess Nana Asma&#x27;u (1793-1864).

====Horn of Africa====
In the Horn of Africa, there are a number of sources documenting the development of a distinct Ethiopian philosophy from the first millennium onwards. Among the most notable examples from this tradition emerge from the work of the 17th-century philosopher Zera Yacob, and that of his disciple Walda Heywat. Yacob in his writings discusses religion, morality, and existence. He comes to the belief that every person will believe their faith to be the right one and that all men are created equal.

====Southern Africa====
In Southern Africa and Southeast Africa the development of a distinctive Bantu philosophy addressing the nature of existence, the cosmos and humankind&#x27;s relation to the world following the Bantu migration has had the most significant impact on the philosophical developments of the said regions, with the development of the philosophy of Ubuntu as one notable example emerging from this worldview.

====Central &amp; East Africa====
Many Central African philosophical traditions before the Bantu migration into southern Central Africa have been identified as a uniting characteristic of many Nilotic and Sudanic peoples, ultimately giving rise to the distinctive worldviews identified in the conceptions of time, the creation of the world, human nature, and the proper relationship between mankind and nature prevalent in Dinka mythology, Maasai mythology and similar traditions.

====African diaspora====
Some pre-modern African diasporic philosophical traditions have also been identified, mostly produced by descendants of Africans in Europe and the Americas. One notable pre-modern diasporic African philosopher was Anthony William Amo in the 18th century, who was taken as a slave from Awukenu in what is now Ghana, and was brought up and educated in Europe where he gained doctorates in medicine and philosophy, and subsequently became a professor of philosophy at the universities of Halle and Jena in Germany.

== Modern trends ==
Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka has distinguished what he calls four trends in modern African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, philosophical sagacity, nationalistic–ideological philosophy, and professional philosophy. In fact it would be more realistic to call them candidates for the position of African philosophy, with the understanding that more than one of them might fit the bill. (Oruka later added two additional categories: literary/artistic philosophy, such as the work of literary figures such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, Wole Soyinka, Chinua Achebe, Okot p&#x27;Bitek, and Taban Lo Liyong, and hermeneutic philosophy, the analysis of African languages in order to find philosophical content.) In the African diaspora, American philosopher Maulana Karenga has also been notable in presenting varied definitions for understanding modern African philosophy, especially as it relates to its earliest sources.

One notable contributor to professional philosophy is Achille Mbembe. He interacts with a multitude of modern subjects, including thoughts on statehood, death, capital, racism, and colonialism. He invokes attention to moral and political arguments through a tone of morality in his works. Many recent pieces from Mbembe, including &quot;Critique of Black Reason&quot;, suggest that understanding Europe as a force not at the center of the universe is a point from which philosophy and society should view the world. Mbembe asserts that he positions himself in multiple worlds of existence at one time. This method creates an empathetic point from which the world can be viewed.

===Ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity===
Henry Odera Oruka of Kenya came up with Sage Philosophy and philosophic sagacity is attributed to him. Ethnophilosophy has been used to record the beliefs found in African cultures. Such an approach treats African philosophy as consisting in a set of shared beliefs, values, categories, and assumptions that are implicit in the language, practices, and beliefs of African cultures; in short, the uniquely African worldview. As such, it is seen as an item of communal property rather than an activity for the individual.

One proponent of this form, Placide Tempels, argued in &quot;Bantu Philosophy&quot; that the metaphysical categories of the Bantu people are reflected in their linguistic categories. According to this view, African philosophy can be best understood as springing from the fundamental assumptions about reality reflected in the languages of Africa.

Another example of this sort of approach is the work of Ebiegberi Joe Alagoa of the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria, who argues for the existence of an African philosophy of history stemming from traditional proverbs from the Niger Delta in his paper &quot;An African Philosophy of History in the Oral Tradition.&quot; Alagoa argues that in African philosophy, age is seen as an important factor in gaining wisdom and interpreting the past. In support of this view, he cites proverbs such as &quot;More days, more wisdom&quot;, and &quot;What an old man sees seated, a youth does not see standing.&quot; Truth is seen as eternal and unchanging (&quot;Truth never rots&quot;), but people are subject to error (&quot;Even a four-legged horse stumbles and falls&quot;). It is dangerous to judge by appearances (&quot;A large eye does not mean keen vision&quot;), but first-hand observation can be trusted (&quot;He who sees does not err&quot;). The past is not seen as fundamentally different from the present, but all history is contemporary history (&quot;A storyteller does not tell of a different season&quot;). The future remains beyond knowledge (&quot;Even a bird with a long neck cannot see the future&quot;). Nevertheless, it is said, &quot;God will outlive eternity.&quot; History is seen as vitally important (&quot;One ignorant of his origin is nonhuman&quot;), and historians (known as &quot;sons of the soil&quot;) are highly revered (&quot;The son of the soil has the python&#x27;s keen eyes&quot;). However, these arguments must be taken with a grain of cultural relativism, as the span of culture in Africa is incredibly vast, with patriarchies, matriarchies, monotheists and traditional religionists among the population, and as such the attitudes of groups of the Niger Delta cannot be applied to the whole of Africa.

Another more controversial application of this approach is embodied in the concept of Negritude. Leopold Senghor, a proponent of Negritude, argued that the distinctly African approach to reality is based on emotion rather than logic, works itself out in participation rather than analysis, and manifests itself through the arts rather than the sciences. Cheikh Anta Diop and Mubabinge Bilolo, on the other hand, while agreeing that African culture is unique, challenged the view of Africans as essentially emotional and artistic, arguing that Egypt was an African culture whose achievements in science, mathematics, architecture, and philosophy were pre-eminent. This philosophy may also be maligned as overly reductionist due to the obvious scientific and scholarly triumphs of not only ancient Egypt, but also Nubia, Meroe, as well as the great library of Timbuktu, the extensive trade networks and kingdoms of North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, the Horn of Africa and Great Zimbabwe and the other major empires of Southern, Southeast and Central Africa.

Critics of this approach argue that the actual philosophical work in producing a coherent philosophical position is being done by the academic philosopher (such as Alagoa), and that the sayings of the same culture can be selected from and organised in many different ways in order to produce very different, often contradictory systems of thought.

Philosophical sagacity is a sort of individualist version of ethnophilosophy, in which one records the beliefs of certain special members of a community. The premise here is that, although most societies demand some degree of conformity of belief and behaviour from their members, a certain few of those members reach a particularly high level of knowledge and understanding of their cultures&#x27; worldviews; such people are sages. In some cases, the sage goes beyond mere knowledge and understanding to reflection and questioning—these become the targets of philosophical sagacity.

Critics of this approach note that not all reflection and questioning is philosophical; besides, if African philosophy were to be defined purely in terms of philosophic sagacity, then the thoughts of the sages could not be African philosophy, for they did not record them from other sages. Also, on this view the only difference between non-African anthropology or ethnology and African philosophy seems to be the nationality of the researcher.

Critics argue further that the problem with both ethnophilosophy and philosophical sagacity is that there is surely an important distinction between philosophy and the history of ideas, although other philosophers consider the two topics to be remarkably similar. The argument is that no matter how interesting the beliefs of a people such as the Akan or the Yoruba may be to the philosopher, they remain beliefs, not philosophy. To call them philosophy is to use a secondary sense of that term, as in &quot;my philosophy is live and let live.&quot;

===Professional philosophy===
Professional philosophy is usually identified as that produced by African philosophers trained in the Western philosophical tradition, that embraces a universal view of the methods and concerns of philosophy. Those philosophers identified in this category often explicitly reject the assumptions of ethnophilosophy and adopt a universalist worldview of philosophy that requires all philosophy to be accessible and applicable to all peoples and cultures in the world. This is even if the specific philosophical questions prioritized by individual national or regional philosophies may differ. Some African philosophers classified in this category are Odera Oruka, Paulin Hountondji, Peter Bodunrin, Kwasi Wiredu, Tsenay Serequeberhan, Marcien Towa and Lansana Keita.

===Nationalist and ideological philosophy===

Nationalist and ideological philosophy might be considered a special case of philosophic sagacity, in which not sages but ideologues are the subjects. Alternatively, it has been considered as a subcategory of professional political philosophy. In either case, the same sort of problem arises with retaining a distinction between ideology and philosophy, and also between sets of ideas and a special way of reasoning. Examples include African socialism, Nkrumaism, Harambee and Authenticité.

===African ethics===
Although Africa is extremely diverse, there appear to be some shared moral ideas across many ethnic groups. In a number of African cultures, ethics is centered on a person&#x27;s character, and saying &quot;he has no morals&quot; translates as something like &quot;he has no character&quot;. A person&#x27;s character reflects the accumulation of their deeds and their habits of conduct; hence, it can be changed over a person&#x27;s life. In some African cultures, &quot;personhood&quot; refers to an adult human who exhibits moral virtues, and one who behaves badly is not considered a person, even if he is considered a human.

While many traditional African societies are highly religious, their religions are not revealed, and hence, ethics does not center around divine commands. Instead, ethics is humanistic and utilitarian: it focuses on improving social functioning and human flourishing. On the other hand, social welfare is not a mere aggregate of individual welfare; rather, there is a collective &quot;social good&quot; embodying values that everyone wants, like peace and stability. In general, African ethics is social or collectivistic rather than individualistic and united in ideology. Cooperation and altruism are considered crucial. African ethics places more weight on duties of prosocial behaviour than on rights per se, in contrast to most of Western ethics.

===Africana philosophy===

Africana philosophy is the work of philosophers of African descent and others whose work deals with the subject matter of the African diaspora. This is a relatively new (since the 1980s) and developing name given to African thought, and it is given credible attention by professional organizations, including the American Philosophical Association.

Africana philosophy includes the philosophical ideas, arguments and theories of particular concern to people of African descent. Some of the topics explored by Africana philosophy include: pre-Socratic African philosophy and modern day debates discussing the early history of Western philosophy, post-colonial writing in Africa and the Americas, black resistance to oppression, black existentialism in the United States, and the meaning of &quot;blackness&quot; in the modern world.

== African epistemology ==
African epistemology is epistemology from the African perspective, and is therefore rooted in African ontology which is unitary and communal. If epistemology concerns knowledge and non-knowledge, African epistemology considers awareness of what is and can be known, and what isn&#x27;t and can&#x27;t be known, contending that human knowledge is, and always will be, humility-inducingly limited and dwarfed by what isn&#x27;t known. In the search for a comprehensive knowledge, approximation is considered desirable.

Ancestral spirits, i.e. spirits of individuals that once inhabited the physical world, are central to traditional African thought. It is believed they are still capable of actions which have consequences in the physical world, and having knowledge of their intentions provides grounds for understanding physical occurrences. Reality is conceived in a holistic view in which personalism is expressed in concrete consubstantiation of spirit. While Western epistemology follows analytical reason, African epistemology follows emotional and intuitive reason where experience is foundational to knowledge, and experience is acted upon by and combined with reason to produce a &quot;complete knowledge&quot;. Fundamentally, there is thought to be more to the realm of experience than what can be unearthed via empirical enquiry. This contrasts the fundamental tenet of Western culture where science is the main determiner of what is and is not real, and anything unconfirmed by science is viewed as metaphysical fantasy or superstition. This informs what is termed the &quot;colonial myth on Africa&quot;, and African scholars have defended &quot;African rational, logical and analytic consciousness and thought patterns&quot;, pointing to the cultural embeddings of knowledge.

African philosophy seeks a middle ground between dualism and monism regarding the material and spiritual, noting their correlativity. Epistemological dualism, where the epistemic subject and epistemic object are separated, is absent from African epistemology, and the epistemic subject &quot;experiences the epistemic object in a sensuous, emotive, intuitive, abstractive understanding, rather than through abstraction alone, as is the case in Western epistemology&quot;. Thus, oral traditions, music, folklore, myths, proverbs and the like are utilized in the preservation and transmission of knowledge. African epistemology is the endeavour of the individual, not the community and therefore not ethnophilosophy, and holders of knowledge are considered moral agents that treat knowledge as a tool to moralise/humanise themselves and the society as a whole, thus knowledge is definitively used to address human societal challenges.

Criticisms come from African neo-positivists, who argue that African epistemology must have a basic method of testing knowledge claims to be truly valid. A response is that Africans don&#x27;t prioritise separation of knowledge and belief, but prioritise whether it is true or false, often seeking a third party&#x27;s opinion or further evidence from a reliable/truthful person. Truth is considered relativist, and relies on what is meant or understood, which is not always translatable between individuals or cultures owing to differing paradigms and linguistical conventions. Thus knowledge is viewed as a societal convention rather than an objectivist phenomenon. Universal justifiers of epistemological claims are: linguistic-conceptual schemes, human nature, socio-cultural values and interests, and customs and habits, which commonly instil confidence.

<text>Ji Mantriji (literally &quot;Yes Minister&quot; in Hindi) is an Indian adaptation of the British satirical sitcom &quot;Yes Minister&quot;. It was telecast from 26 April 2001 on StarPlus with permission from the BBC. &quot;Ji Mantriji&quot; features Farooq Sheikh as Surya Prakash Singh, the Minister of Administrative Affairs; and Jayant Kripalani as the department&#x27;s secretary. The plot lines were the same as those of the original, with suitable changes in the Indian context. &quot;Ji Mantriji&quot; was produced by NDTV in collaboration with BBC Worldwide. The opening titles for each episode were illustrated by famous Indian cartoonist, R. K. Laxman, well known for his political cartoon series, The Common Man.

&quot;Ji Mantriji&quot; was in production for a year before being aired, which is unusual in Indian television where serials are generally developed and produced a few weeks in advance. The writers changed certain references to fit the new setting: France was changed to Pakistan and the European Economic Community was changed to the SAARC and the Commonwealth. A sequel, &quot;Ji Pradhanmantriji&quot; (Yes Prime Minister) was also produced. The books accompanying the series were published in India by Penguin Books.

==Cast==
*Farooq Sheikh as Surya Prakash Singh
*Jayant Kripalani as Rajnath Mathur

<text>.post is a sponsored top-level domain (STLD), available exclusively for the postal sector, and is secured by DNSSEC. The domain aims to integrate the physical, financial, and electronic dimensions of postal services to enable and facilitate e-post, e-finance, e-commerce, and e-government services. ICANN approved the domain on April 8, 2005, as a sponsored TLD in the second group of new TLD applications evaluated in 2004.

In 2004, the Universal Postal Union (UPU), based in Bern, was the first United Nations agency to secure a top-level domain (TLD) from ICANN.

In 2009, ICANN and the UPU signed a historic agreement, giving the UPU managing authority over .post as a top-level domain. The agreement came about after negotiations and public review through ICANN&#x27;s public comment process, reviews within the UPU governing councils, and consideration by ICANN&#x27;s Board of Directors.

Having been delegated authority for .post, the UPU develops, implements, and monitors government rules for it. It is also responsible for attributing domain names to postal-sector stakeholders who meet the eligibility criteria.

The STLD was added to the IANA TLD registry on August 8, 2012.

==Purpose==
.post was designed to serve the needs of the global postal community in cyberspace. The idea behind .post was to identify legitimate postal services and avoid confusion for individuals, businesses, and stakeholders. As of October 2014, out of 192 UPU member countries, 38 are full members of the Dot Post Group (DPG), which is appointed to oversee the development of this platform. A few of those have already launched their .post web site. Most of them offer a web interface to traditional post office services such as printed letters and parcels delivery. One of them also features Postal Registered Electronic Mail (PREM) among its services.

==Authentication==
To register a .post domain, the UPU asks entities to submit a Community ID request. Registrants must be approved as being members of the .post Sponsored Community before registering domains.

Prior to registering a .post domain, the UPU verifies the registrant&#x27;s eligibility to register a domain name and issues a .post Community ID.

Each applicant is required to provide legal proof of ownership of the string, as well as falling into 1 of 11 Registrant Groups set out in paragraph 3.3 of the .post Domain Management Policy.
