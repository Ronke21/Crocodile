<text>Five Little Pigs is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the US by Dodd, Mead and Company in May 1942 under the title Murder in Retrospect and in the UK by the Collins Crime Club in January 1943 (although some sources state that publication was in November 1942). The UK first edition carries a copyright date of 1942 and retailed at eight shillings while the US edition was priced at $2.00.

In the book, detective Hercule Poirot investigates five people about a murder committed sixteen years earlier. Caroline Crale died in prison after being convicted of murdering her husband, Amyas Crale, by poisoning him. In her final letter from prison, she claims to be innocent of the murder. Her daughter Carla Lemarchant asks Poirot to investigate this cold case, based on the memories of the people closest to the couple.

==Plot summary==

Sixteen years after Caroline Crale was convicted of fatally poisoning her husband Amyas, her twenty-one-year-old daughter Carla Lemarchant is given a letter; in it, the late Caroline claims to be innocent of the murder. Carla asks Hercule Poirot to reinvestigate the case; he does, and establishes that, on the day of the murder at the Crales&#x27; home, there were five other people present. Poirot dubs these &quot;the five little pigs&quot; – stockbroker Philip Blake, amateur chemist Meredith Blake (Philip&#x27;s brother), Caroline&#x27;s young half-sister Angela Warren, Angela&#x27;s governess Cecilia Williams, and Amyas&#x27;s painting model Elsa Greer. The police investigation found that Amyas had died of coniine poisoning, and Caroline confessed to stealing coniine from Meredith&#x27;s lab, as she had been contemplating suicide. She had later brought a cold bottle of beer to Amyas, and both the police and the jury assumed she had poisoned the beer because Amyas was openly having an affair with Elsa.

Poirot interviews the five other suspects, noting that none has an obvious motive, and that Caroline&#x27;s half-sister Angela is the only one who believes Caroline was innocent. He assembles the five, along with Carla and her fiancé, at Meredith Blake&#x27;s house, and reveals the truth. Caroline was innocent, but chose not to defend herself because she believed Angela had committed the murder. Although Angela had handled the beer bottle, she had added nothing to it before her sister took it to Amyas. Caroline later assumed that her sister had added something to the beer as a prank, accidentally causing Amyas&#x27;s death. When they were children, Caroline had thrown a paperweight at Angela, blinding her in one eye and scarring her face; Caroline had suffered from guilt ever since, and believed that sacrificing herself for Angela was a way to atone for her sin.

Poirot reveals the murderer was Elsa Greer. She had taken Amyas&#x27; promises to marry her seriously, unaware that he was merely lying to keep her from leaving until his &quot;masterpiece&quot; painting was finished. She overheard Amyas reassure Caroline that he was not going to divorce her, felt betrayed, and wanted revenge. She had seen Caroline take the poison from Meredith&#x27;s lab, so she took it from Caroline&#x27;s room and put it in a glass of warm beer that she gave Amyas. When Caroline later brought him a cold bottle of beer, he commented that &quot;everything tastes foul today&quot; after drinking it; this remark had shown Poirot that Amyas had taken the nasty-tasting coniine before Caroline brought him the beer. 

Poirot&#x27;s explanation solves the case to the satisfaction of Carla and her fiancé. He plans to present his findings to the police, though he admits the chances of a posthumous pardon for Caroline or a murder conviction for Elsa are slim, due to the lack of physical evidence. As she leaves, Elsa contends that Amyas and Caroline escaped her revenge, and that she, now living an empty life, is the one who really &quot;died&quot;.

==Characters==
* Hercule Poirot: the Belgian detective.
* Carla Lemarchant: the daughter of Caroline and Amyas Crale; born Caroline Crale II, she was aged 5 when her father was murdered at their home, Alderbury.
* John Rattery: fiancé of Carla.
* Amyas Crale: painter by profession, who liked his paintings and his mistresses but loved his wife most. He was murdered 16 years before the story opens.
* Caroline Crale: wife of Amyas, half-sister to the younger Angela Warren, of whom she was fiercely protective. She was found guilty of the murder of her husband and died in prison within a year.
* Sir Montague Depleach: Counsel for the Defence in the original trial.
* Quentin Fogg, KC: Junior for the Prosecution in the original trial.
* George Mayhew: son of Caroline&#x27;s solicitor in the original trial.
* Edmunds: Managing clerk in Mayhew&#x27;s firm.
* Caleb Jonathan: Family solicitor for the Crales.
* Superintendent Hale: Investigating officer in the original case.

The five people Poirot questions, who he dubs &quot;the five little pigs&quot; after the nursery rhyme &quot;This Little Piggy&quot;, are: 
* Philip Blake: a stockbroker (&quot;This little piggy went to market&quot;). He expressed disdain for Caroline, but was actually attracted to her.
* Meredith Blake: Philip&#x27;s elder brother, a reclusive one-time amateur herbalist who owns the adjacent property, Handcross Manor (&quot;This little piggy stayed at home&quot;). He had at one point hoped to marry Caroline, but after the murder he proposed to Elsa and was rejected.
* Lady Dittisham, née Elsa Greer: a spoiled society lady, formerly the twenty-year-old mistress to Amyas Crale (&quot;This little piggy had roast beef&quot;). 
* Cecilia Williams: the devoted governess (&quot;This little piggy had none&quot;).
* Angela Warren: half-sister of Caroline Crale, a disfigured archaeologist (&quot;This little piggy cried &#x27;wee wee wee&#x27; all the way home&quot;). She was a teenager at the time of the murder.

==Literary significance and reception==

Author and critic Maurice Willson Disher&#x27;s review in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; of 16 January 1943 concluded, &quot;No crime enthusiast will object that the story of how the painter died has to be told many times, for this, even if it creates an interest which is more problem than plot, demonstrates the author&#x27;s uncanny skill. The answer to the riddle is brilliant.&quot;

Maurice Richardson reviewed the novel in the 10 January 1943 issue of &quot;The Observer&quot;, writing: &quot;Despite only five suspects, Mrs Christie, as usual, puts a ring through the reader&#x27;s nose and leads him to one of her smashing last-minute showdowns. This is well up to the standard of her middle Poirot period. No more need be said.&quot;

J D Beresford in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s 20 January 1943 review, wrote: &quot;...Christie never fails us, and her &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; presents a very pretty problem for the ingenious reader&quot;. He concluded that the clue as to who had committed the crime was &quot;completely satisfying&quot;.

Robert Barnard has strong praise for this novel and its plot. He remarked that it was &quot;The-murder-in-the-past plot on its first and best appearance – accept no later substitutes. Presentation more intricate than usual, characterization more subtle.&quot; His judgment was that &quot;All in all, it is a beautifully tailored book, rich and satisfying. The present writer would be willing to chance his arm and say that this is the best Christie of all.&quot;

Charles Osborne praised this novel, saying that &quot;The solution of the mystery in &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; is not only immediately convincing but satisfying as well, and even moving in its inevitability and its bleakness.&quot;

==References and allusions==

The novel&#x27;s title is from the nursery rhyme &quot;This Little Piggy&quot;, which is used by Poirot to organise his thoughts regarding the investigation. Each of the five little pigs mentioned in the nursery rhyme is used as a title for a chapter in the book, corresponding to the five suspects. Agatha Christie used this style of title in other novels, including &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe,&quot; &quot;Hickory Dickory Dock&quot;, &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot;, and &quot;Crooked House.&quot;

Hercule Poirot mentions the celebrated case of Hawley Harvey Crippen as an example of a crime reinterpreted to satisfy the public enthusiasm for psychology.

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is a theme among characters recalling the trial, starting with solicitor Caleb Jonathan reading Juliet&#x27;s lines from the balcony scene: &quot;If that thy bent of love...&quot;. Jonathan compares Juliet to the character of Elsa Greer, for their passion, recklessness, and lack of concern about other people.

Coniine (in the story, specifically coniine hydrobromide, derived from poison hemlock) was indeed the poison with which Socrates took his own life, as described by Phaedo, and has indeed been used to treat whooping cough and asthma. The &quot;poisons act&quot; referred to is the Pharmacy and Poisons Act 1933, now superseded by the Poisons Act 1972. 

The painting that is hung upon the wall of Cecilia Williams&#x27; room, described as a &quot;blind girl sitting on an orange,&quot; is by George Frederic Watts and is called &quot;Hope.&quot; In it, a blind girl is featured with a harp which, though it has only one string left, she does not give up playing. The description is by Oswald Bastable, a character in the third book in the Bastable series by E. Nesbit, titled &quot;The New Treasure Seekers&quot;. The other identifiable prints are &quot;Dante and Beatrice&quot;, and &quot;Primavera&quot; by Botticelli.

Amyas has two paintings in the Tate. Miss Williams remarks disparagingly that &quot;So is one of Mr Epstein&#x27;s statues,&quot; referring to American-born British sculptor Jacob Epstein.

When Poirot approaches Meredith Blake, he introduces himself as a friend of Lady Mary Lytton-Gore, a character known from &quot;Three Act Tragedy&quot;. This case is later referred to by Poirot many years later, in &quot;Elephants Can Remember&quot;, published in 1972.

&quot;Take what you want and pay for it, says God&quot; is referred to as an &quot;old Spanish proverb&quot; by Elsa. The same proverb is cited in &quot;Hercule Poirot&#x27;s Christmas&quot;. The proverb is mentioned in &quot;South Riding&quot; (1936), by Winifred Holtby, and in &quot;Windfall&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1929), by Edward Verrall Lucas.

The &quot;interesting tombs in the Fayum&quot; refers to the Fayum Basin south of Cairo, famous for Fayum mummy portraits.

Angela Warren refers to Shakespeare, and quotes John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot;: &quot;Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave&quot;.

In the UK version of the story &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot;, Poirot refers to the novel &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;, by W. Somerset Maugham, when he asks Angela Warren if she had recently read it at the time of the murder. Poirot deduces that Angela must have read &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; from a detail given in Philip Blake&#x27;s account of the murder, in which he describes an enraged Angela quarrelling with Amyas and expressing the hope that Amyas would die of leprosy. The central character of &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot;, Charles Strickland, is a stockbroker who deserts his wife and children to become an artist and eventually dies of leprosy.

==Adaptations==

===1960 play===

In 1960, Christie adapted the book into a play, &quot;Go Back for Murder&quot;, but edited Poirot out of the story. His function in the story is filled by a young lawyer, Justin Fogg, son of the lawyer who led Caroline Crale&#x27;s defence. During the course of the play, it is revealed that Carla&#x27;s fiancé is an obnoxious American who is strongly against her revisiting the case, and in the end, she leaves him for Fogg. &quot;Go Back for Murder&quot; previewed in Edinburgh, Scotland. It later came to London&#x27;s Duchess Theatre on 23 March 1960, but it lasted for only thirty-seven performances.

&quot;Go Back for Murder&quot; was included in the 1978 Christie play collection, &quot;The Mousetrap and Other Plays&quot;.

===Television===

* 2003: &quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; – Episode 1, Series 9, of &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;, starring David Suchet as Poirot. There were many changes to the story. Caroline was executed, instead of being sentenced to life in prison and then dying a year later. Philip has a romantic infatuation with Amyas, rather than Caroline, the root of his dislike for Caroline. Carla&#x27;s name was changed to Lucy and she has no fiancé. She does not fear she has hereditary criminal tendencies; she merely wishes to prove her mother innocent. After Poirot exposes Elsa, Lucy threatens her with a pistol; Elsa dares her to shoot, but Poirot persuades her to leave Elsa to face justice.

:The cast of the 2003 version includes Rachael Stirling as Caroline, Julie Cox as Elsa, Toby Stephens as Philip, Aidan Gillen as Amyas, Sophie Winkleman as adult Angela, Talulah Riley as young Angela, Aimee Mullins as Lucy, Marc Warren as Meredith, Patrick Malahide as Sir Montague Depleach, and Gemma Jones as Miss Williams.

* 2011: &quot;Cinq petits cochons&quot; – Episode 7, Series 1, of &quot;Les Petits Meurtres d&#x27;Agatha Christie&quot;, a French television series. The setting is changed to France, Poirot is omitted, and the case is solved by Émile Lampion (Marius Colucci), a police detective turned private investigator, and his former boss, Chief Inspector Larosière (Antoine Duléry). The plot is once again adapted very loosely. The character of Philip Blake is omitted. Caroline is alive and exonerated at the end. The identification of the &quot;five little pigs&quot; with the suspects is omitted, but the rhyme appears in the Carla character&#x27;s childhood memories of her father.

===Radio===
&quot;Five Little Pigs&quot; was adapted for radio and broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1994, featuring John Moffatt as Poirot.

<doc id="1101759" wikidata="Q1155133" url="?curid=1101759" title="Email marketing">
<text>Email marketing is the act of sending a commercial message, typically to a group of people, using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant&#x27;s relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads.

== History ==
Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century. Before this growth, when emails were novelties to most customers, email marketing was not as effective. In 1978, Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET). He claimed that this resulted in $13 million worth of sales of DEC products, and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails.

==Types==
Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails:

=== Transactional emails ===
Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer&#x27;s action with a company. To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages, these communications&#x27; primary purpose must be &quot;to facilitate, complete or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender&quot; along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging. Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages, password reset emails, purchase or order confirmation emails, order status emails, reorder emails, and email receipts.

The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it. But, due to their high open rates (51.3% compared to 36.6% for email newsletters), transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers; to anticipate and answer questions; or to cross-sell or up-sell products or services.

=== Direct emails ===
Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message (for example, a special offer or a product catalog). Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to, or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies. 

==Comparison to traditional mail==
There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail.

===Advantages===
Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons:
* Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail, mainly because with email, most of the cost falls on the recipient.
* Email marketing platforms provide detailed analytics, allowing businesses to track open rates, click-through rates, and other important metrics to evaluate campaign performance.
* Automation tools make it easier to schedule and send emails at specific times or based on user actions, saving time and effort.
* Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP (email service provider) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients. The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior.
* Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day, with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates.

===Disadvantages===
* As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers. According to the report, legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73% in the U.S.; six percent were filtered as spam, and 22% were missing. This lags behind other countries: Australia delivers at 90%, Canada at 89%, Britain at 88%, France at 84%, Germany at 80% and Brazil at 79%.
* Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States&#x27; Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM), the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, or their Internet service provider&#x27;s acceptable use policy.
* An overwhelming amount of commercial email or untargeted emails can be irritating to consumers. This irritation can lead to consumers unsubscribing from all messages or building a negative brand association. Untargeted emails lead to low click through rate, hindering marketing campaign performance.

==Opt-in email advertising==
Opt-in email advertising, or permission marketing, is advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it.

A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm&#x27;s customers. Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions, or new products. In this type of advertising, a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter.

With a foundation of opted-in contact information stored in their database, marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders—known as drip marketing. They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments.

==Legal requirements==

===Australia===
The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, widely known as &quot;ACMA&quot;. The act defines the term &quot;unsolicited electronic messages&quot;, states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages, and gives other key information. Fines range with three fines of AU$110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines (2011), Tiger Airways Holdings Limited (2012) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited (2013).

===Canada===
The &quot;Canada Anti-Spam Law&quot; (CASL) went into effect on July 1, 2014. CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt-in from users, and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA$1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses.

===European Union and UK ===
In 2002 the European Union (EU) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications. Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes. The Directive establishes the opt-in regime, where unsolicited emails may be sent only with the prior agreement of the recipient; this does not apply to business email addresses. The UK gives sole traders and members of unincorporated partnerships the same protection as private individuals.

The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states. In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication.

The GDPR in 2018 imposed &quot;a number of new requirements on companies that collect, store and process personal data from EU users, which impacts email marketers&quot; - in particular, users&#x27; right to access information held about them; and the right to have all such information deleted at their request.

===United States ===
The CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response to the growing number of complaints over spam emails. Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally, that those who send commercial emails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them, and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them. The act authorizes a US$16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient. However, it does not ban spam emailing outright, but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are &quot;materially false or misleading&quot;. In addition, there are conditions that email marketers must meet in terms of their format, their content and labeling. As a result, many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act. A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act. To comply with the act&#x27;s regulation of commercial email, services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address, provide a one-click unsubscribe feature, and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission.

In addition to satisfying legal requirements, email service providers (ESPs) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns. The service providers supply email templates and general best practices, as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically. Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers. They also provide statistics about the number of messages received and opened, and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages.

The CAN-SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no-fee provision for opting out, further definition of &quot;sender&quot;, post office or private mail boxes count as a &quot;valid physical postal address&quot; and definition of &quot;person&quot;. These new provisions went into effect on July 7, 2008.

<doc id="1101763" wikidata="Q1535408" url="?curid=1101763" title="Kasabian (album)">
<text>Kasabian is the debut studio album by British rock band Kasabian, released on 6 September 2004. The album&#x27;s highest chart position on the UK Albums Chart was number 4, making it the band&#x27;s only studio album not to reach number one. Five singles were released from &quot;Kasabian&quot;.

This is the only full album to feature the lead guitarist and lead songwriter Christopher Karloff, who left the band during the recording sessions of their next album, &quot;Empire&quot;. The album features a rotating cast of drummers, with full-time drummer Ian Matthews joining the band after the release of the album.

== Release ==
Different geographical regions had different colours for their album cover. The British version is black and white, the European import is black and red, and the American version is black and blue. The Japanese &quot;Ultimate Version&quot; is silver and white. The UK limited edition version is a double-sided DualDisc and has a glow-in-the-dark cover. The DVD element contains a making-of documentary and several music videos.

This album has been released with the Copy Control protection system in some regions. In the United States and Canada it uses the MediaMax CD-3 system.

The Canadian version of the album does not contain the songs &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Pinch Roller&quot; and &quot;Ovary Stripe&quot;, with the exception of digital releases.

== Composition ==

=== Tracks ===
The opening track &quot;Club Foot&quot; features a signature distorted bass riff, played by Christopher Karloff and features &quot;a quilt of relentless beats, hissing electronic noises, buzzing guitar and Tom Meighan&#x27;s breathless, menacing vocals&quot;, and lyrics inspired by the Iraq War. &quot;Processed Beats&quot;, one of eventual drummer Ian Matthews&#x27; two contributions to the album has been compared to The Stone Roses with its &quot;shambolic beat&quot; and unison chorus from Meighan and Pizzorno. &quot;Reason is Treason&quot; was branded as an &quot;indie rock seducer&quot;, with a sound resembling &quot;Stereolab backing Ian Brown&quot;. 

&quot;L.S.F (Lost Souls Forever)&quot; features prominent use of the electronic instrument Omnichord, played by Karloff and was described as featuring &quot;massive backswells of low-end punch overlaid with Tom Meighan&#x27;s monotonic snarl and Sergio Pizzorno&#x27;s swirling guitars and electronics.&quot; &quot;Test Transmission&quot;, the first of two songs to feature Pizzorno on lead vocals was branded as &quot;prog rock danced in baggy jeans&quot; and &quot;Chemical Brothers-esque psychedelic electronica&quot;. Noted for its opening lyric &#x27;John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD&#x27;, the fifth and final single &quot;Cutt Off&quot; &quot;pitches space-age synths to the sort of psycho-babble only usually risked by Orb&quot;.

&quot;Butcher Blues&quot; was described as &quot;cinematic&quot; and featuring &quot;hazy dissolves, tube station announcement vocals, and head-nodding electronic percussion&quot;. After the instrumental track &quot;Ovary Stripe&quot;, &quot;U Boat&quot; closes out the album, featuring Pizzorno&#x27;s vocals over &quot;layered organic and electronic bliss&quot;, resulting in &quot;space rock meeting angst rock&quot;. After a long gap, a hidden track plays, the Jacknife Lee remix of &quot;Reason is Treason&quot;.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Kasabian&quot; received generally favourable reviews but music critics were mixed on the band&#x27;s mixture of alternative rock and electronica. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 21 reviews.

AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries praised the album for its take on different rock genres and compared them favourably to The Stone Roses and Tangerine Dream, saying that &quot;Painting them as rock&#x27;s saviors just makes the overly ambitious moments of the album look all that much bigger.&quot; Paul Moody of &quot;NME&quot; praised the album for its aggressive instrumentals and space rock sound resembling that of The Libertines. He singled out &quot;Test Transmission&quot; as the standout track, calling it &quot;an indication that once they&#x27;ve purged the violent tendencies, a future as space-rockers in the Spiritualized mould awaits.&quot; Betty Clarke of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the album&#x27;s overall sound for resembling baggy music, saying that it &quot;sums up Kasabian&#x27;s affection for experimentation of every description.&quot;

Johnny Loftus, writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, commended the album&#x27;s high-energy tracks for containing production that will grab listeners&#x27; attention but felt that it loses steam in places and will send said listeners away to better records that inspired it, concluding that &quot;&quot;Kasabian&quot; is brash, loutish, and seems liable at times to cut you; the consistent kick drum beat throughout it is like a great party&#x27;s heartbeat. But like the roustabout in the corner, drinking all the lager and scratching up your old records, it can be more loudmouthed than substantial.&quot; Tom Edwards of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; criticized the album&#x27;s songs for lacking any hooks and nuances to grab the listener&#x27;s attention concluding with, &quot;Sure this album may well sound awesome if you&#x27;ve just snorted a metre of charlie or recently breakfasted from a menu of &#x27;shrooms and LSD, but for sober ears it&#x27;s enough to drive anyone to drugs.&quot; Barry Walters of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; criticized the band for filling the album with half-baked ideas based on influences from Happy Mondays and Primal Scream, saying that &quot;Kasabian make the mistake of trying to be revolutionary by quoting revolutionaries.&quot;

<text>Park Yong-ha (, August 12, 1977 – June 30, 2010) was a South Korean actor and singer.

==Career==
At seventeen, Park was noted for his acting and musical skills, as well as his good looks which earned him popularity with fans. After his debut in MBC drama &quot;Theme Theater&quot; (1994), Park appeared in a range of TV dramas and films. In 2002, Park co-starred in &quot;Winter Sonata&quot; with Bae Yong-joon and Choi Ji-woo, which brought him fame in Japan.

===Music===
As a singer, Park was the &quot;mysterious&quot; voice behind &quot;Just For Yesterday&quot;, the hit theme song of SBS drama &quot;All In&quot;, which starred Lee Byung-hun and Song Hye-kyo.

Park released various Japanese albums in Japan and held successful concerts both in Japan and Korea.

Park sang the theme songs of SBS drama &quot;On Air&quot; in 2008. The Japanese version of the theme songs was his 6th single album &quot;Behind Love&quot;. &quot;Behind Love&quot;, released on July 23, 2008, was ranked as the third top single album on Oricon, Japan&#x27;s premier daily album chart. His next single album, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, and full-length album, &quot;Love&quot;, were released in November 2008 and both were ranked on Oricon within top 10.

===Film and television===

Park starred in SBS drama &quot;On Air&quot; as a drama PD, Kyoung-min Lee, in 2008 and on Mnet Japan from July 30, 2008. He and co-star Song Yun-ah visited Japan to promote the series in a showcase attend by 800 VIP guests at Toho Cinema in Roppongi Hills, Tokyo. He also starred in the movie &quot;The Scam&quot; as an individual investor (small-time investor) Hyun-soo Kang. &quot;The Scam&quot; was released on February 12, 2009. He was cast in the drama, &quot;The Slingshot&quot;, acting as the character Kim Shin, which started broadcasting on KBS2 on April 6, 2009.

==Death==
Park was found dead by his mother at 5:30 am June 30, 2010 at his home in Nonhyeon-dong, Seoul, hanging from a camcorder charger cable after an apparent suicide. Prior to his suicide, he was apparently suffering from the pressures of managing his entertainment company and his career, whilst also coping with his father having cancer. He did not leave a suicide note.

JYJ&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;In Heaven&quot; included a song which was dedicated to Park by his good friend, member Kim Jae-joong.

<doc id="1101772" wikidata="Q1143524" url="?curid=1101772" title="Northern Qi">
<text>Qi, known as the Northern Qi (), Later Qi (後齊) or Gao Qi (高齊) in historiography, was a Chinese imperial dynasty and one of the Northern dynasties during the Northern and Southern dynasties era. It ruled the eastern part of northern China from 550 to 577. The dynasty was founded by Gao Yang (Emperor Wenxuan), and was eventually conquered by the Xianbei-led Northern Zhou dynasty in 577.

==History==
Northern Qi was the successor state of the Chinese Xianbei state of Eastern Wei and was founded by Emperor Wenxuan. Emperor Wenxuan had a Han father of largely Xianbei culture, Gao Huan, and a Xianbei mother, Lou Zhaojun. As Eastern Wei&#x27;s powerful minister Gao Huan was succeeded by his sons Gao Cheng and Gao Yang, who took the throne from Emperor Xiaojing of Eastern Wei in 550 and established Northern Qi as Emperor Wenxuan.

Northern Qi was the strongest state out of the three main states (the other two being Northern Zhou state and Chen Dynasty) in China when Chen was established. Northern Qi however was plagued by violence and/or incompetent emperors (in particular Houzhu), corrupt officials, and deteriorating armies. In 571, an important official who guide the emperors Emperor Wucheng and Houzhu, He Shikai, was killed. Houzhu attempted to strengthen the power of throne, instead he triggered a series of purges that became violent in late 573.

In 577, Northern Qi was assaulted by Northern Zhou, a northwestern kingdom with poorer resources. The Northern Qi, with ineffective leadership, quickly disintegrated within a month, with large scale defections of court and military personnel. Both Houzhu and the last emperor Youzhu were captured, and both died in late 577. Emperor Wenxuan&#x27;s son Gao Shaoyi, the Prince of Fanyang, under protection by Tujue, later declared himself the emperor of Northern Qi in exile, but was turned over by Tujue to Northern Zhou in 580 and exiled to modern Sichuan. It is a matter of dispute whether Gao Shaoyi should properly be considered a Northern Qi emperor, but in any case the year 577 is generally considered by historians as the ending date for Northern Qi.

==Arts==

Northern Qi ceramics mark a revival of Chinese ceramic art, following the disastrous invasions and the social chaos of the 4th century. Northern Qi tombs have revealed some beautiful artifacts, such as porcelain with splashed green designs, previously thought to have been developed under the Tang dynasty.

Markedly unique from earlier depictions of the Buddha, Northern Qi statues tend to be smaller, around three feet tall, and columnar in shape.
A jar has been found in a Northern Qi tomb, which was closed in 576, and is considered as a precursor of the Tang Sancai style of ceramics.

Also, brown glazed wares designed with Sasanian-style figures have been found in these tombs. These works suggest a strong cosmopolitanism and intense exchanges with Western Asia, which are also visible in metalworks and relief sculptures across China during this period. Cosmopolitanism was therefore already current during the Northern Qi period in the 6th century, even before the advent of the notoriously cosmopolitan Tang dynasty, and was often associated with Buddhism.

==Ethnocultural identity==

The Northern Qi, although founded by a ruler of mixed Han/Xianbei origin, strongly asserted their Xianbei ethnic cultural identity. They regarded surviving ethnic Tuoba (themselves also Xianbei) and non-Han of the Northern Wei court and as well as literati of all ethnicities as near Han, referring to them as Han&#x27;er or Han kids (漢兒). However they employed Han and sometimes Central Asian courtiers. While some Qi elite families had expressed strongly anti-Han sentiments due to unclear reasons, they may also lay claim to Han elite origin. Emperor Wenxuan&#x27;s father Gao Huan himself said different things to Han and Xianbei, saying to the Han Chinese that &quot;The Xianbei are your clients, you give them a measure of grain and a bolt of cloth, and they fight for you and enable you to have peace and order, why do you hate them?&quot; and he said in Xianbei to Xianbei people that &quot;The Chinese are your slaves, they [the men] farm for you, the women make your clothing, they bring you your supplies and clothing, keeping you warm and full, why do you want to suppress them?&quot;. Gao Huan was descended from the Gao family of Bohai (高氏), of ethnic Han descent in what is now modern Hebei. He had become Xianbeified as his family had lived for some time in Inner Mongolia after his grandfather was relocated from Bohai.

==Religions==

A Chinese scholar translated the Buddhist text Nirvana Sutra text into a Turkic language during this era. Some Zoroastrianism influences that went into previous states continued onto the state of Northern Qi court, such as the love for Persian dogs (sacred in Zoroastrianism) as they were taken as pets by nobles and eunuchs. The Chinese utilized a number of Persian artifacts and products.

==Northern Qi Great Wall==

Faced with the threat of the Göktürks from the north, from 552 to 556 the Qi built up to 3,000 li (about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi)) of wall from Shanxi to the sea at Shanhai Pass. In 552, the Great Wall was built, starting at the northwest frontier, starting from Lishi (离石) and expanding towards west Shuoxian (朔县), with total length of over 400 kilometers. 

In 555, Emperor Wenxuan commanded to repair and rebuild the existing Great Wall of Northern Wei. Over the course of the year 555 alone, 1.8 million men were mobilized to build the Juyong Pass and extend its wall by 450 kilometres (280 mi) through Datong to the eastern banks of the Yellow River. In 557 a secondary wall was built inside the main one, starting from east of Pianguan (偏关), passing Yanmen Pass, Pingxing (平型) Pass, and continuing to Xiaguan (下关) in Shanxi Province. In 563, Emperor Wucheng built a section of frontier wall along the Taihang Mountains on the border of Shanxi and Hebei provinces. These walls were built quickly from local earth and stones or formed by natural barriers. Two stretches of the stone-and-earth Qi wall still stand in Shanxi today, measuring 3.3 metres (11 ft) wide at their bases and 3.5 metres (11 ft) high on average. In 577 the Northern Zhou conquered the Northern Qi and in 580 made repairs to the existing Qi walls. The route of the Qi and Zhou walls would be mostly followed by the later Ming wall west of Gubeikou.

<text>&quot;L.S.F.&quot; (or &quot;L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever)&quot;) is the second single released by the British rock group Kasabian. It was the band&#x27;s first UK Top 10 hit, peaking at No. 10 and staying in the Top 75 for five weeks. The song also charted in the United States, peaking at No. 32 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Alternative Songs chart.

The song was originally released in October 2003 in the video game &quot;FIFA Football 2004&quot;, but the single was released in August 2004.

In May 2007, &quot;NME&quot; magazine placed &quot;LSF&quot; at number 37 in its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever.

The drums on this track are played by Daniel Ralph Martin, who also played drums on &quot;Cutt Off&quot;, as permanent drummer Ian Matthews did not join until midway through the album&#x27;s recording sessions. Lead guitarist Christopher Karloff fills in as the drummer in the UK music video. The US music video features all five members at the time and is their only video to do so besides &quot;Processed Beats&quot;.

== Background ==

According to &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, the song is &quot;articulating a mood of fear and paranoia surrounding terrorism and the Iraq war, with its chorus couplet of &#x27;We got our backs to the wall / Watch out, they&#x27;re gonna kill us all.&#x27;&quot;

In 2006, bassist Chris Edwards said, &quot;The first LP had military imagery because we were writing it as shit was happening abroad with the army. You’d go down the shops and see ‘THE TROOPS ARE ON FIRE’ in the paper and Serge wrote the lyrics and took influence from this. We weren’t for it or against. We just wrote about what was going on.&quot;

About this song, guitarist Serge Pizzorno said, 

==Reception==

&quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; said, &quot;Both &#x27;L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever)&#x27; and the sweeping &#x27;U Boat&#x27; feel stadium-ready, with massive backswells of low-end punch overlaid with Tom Meighan&#x27;s monotonic snarl and Sergio Pizzorno&#x27;s swirling guitars and electronics.&quot;

<text>The State of Los Altos (), commonly known as Los Altos, was the 6th state of the Federal Republic of Central America from 1838 to 1840 and a short-lived independent republic from 1848 to 1849. Its capital was Quetzaltenango. Los Altos occupied eight departments in the west of present-day Guatemala as well as the Soconusco region in the Mexican state of Chiapas.

The state originated from the political differences and tensions between Guatemala City on one side, and Quetzaltenango and other parts of western Central America on the other. Debate about separation from Guatemala dated from shortly after Central American independence from Spain in 1821. Such a separate state was provided for by the Federal constitutional assembly of November 1824, but there was sizable opposition to the separation in Guatemala City.

As the liberal Federation crumbled into civil war due to the influence of the Guatemalan conservatives and the regular clergy, who had been expelled from Central America after Francisco Morazán&#x27;s bloody invasion of Guatemala in 1829, Los Altos declared itself an independent republic.

The independence of Los Altos from Guatemala was officially proclaimed on 2 February 1838. The Federal government recognized Los Altos as the sixth state of the union and seated the representatives of Los Altos in the Federal Congress on 5 June of that year. The flag of Los Altos was a modification of that of the Central American Union, with a central seal showing a volcano in the background with a quetzal (a local bird symbolizing liberty) in front. This was the first Central American flag to use the quetzal as a symbol; since 1871, it has been on the present flag of Guatemala.

== Administrative divisions ==
Los Altos consisted of the administrative regions of 
* Totonicapán (the modern Guatemalan departments of Totonicapán, Huehuetenango), 
* Quetzaltenango (the modern departments of Quetzaltenango and San Marcos) and
* Suchitepéquez-Sololá (the modern departments of Retalhuleu, Suchitepéquez, Sololá, and Quiché).

== First period of separation ==
=== First invasion of Rafael Carrera ===


On April 2, 1838, in the city of Quetzaltenango, a secessionist group founded the independent State of Los Altos, which sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative regime moved to Los Altos, rather than needing to emigrate to El Salvador to live in a pro-liberal state.

The liberals in Los Altos began a harsh criticism of the Conservative government of Rivera Paz; they even had their own newspaper – &quot;El Popular&quot;, which contributed to the harsh criticism.

However, Los Altos was the most productive region with most economic activity of the former State of Guatemala; without Los Altos, conservatives lost many benefits that held the hegemony of the State of Guatemala in Central America.

The government of Guatemala tried to reach a peaceful solution, but &quot;altenses&quot;, protected by the recognition by the Congress of the Central American Federation, did not accept this. Guatemala&#x27;s government then resorted to force, sending the commanding general of the army, Rafael Carrera, to subdue Los Altos.

Carrera defeated General Agustín Guzmán when the former Mexican officer tried to ambush him and then went on to Quetzaltenango, where he imposed a harsh and hostile conservative regime for liberals. Calling all council members, he told them flatly that he was behaving kindly to them because it was the first time they had challenged him, but sternly warned them that there would be no mercy if there were to be a second time. General Guzmán and the head of state of Los Altos, Marcelo Molina, were sent to the capital of Guatemala, where they were displayed as trophies of war during a triumphant parade on February 17, 1840. Guzmán was shackled, wounds still bleeding, and riding a mule.

=== Second invasion of Rafael Carrera ===


On March 18, 1840, liberal caudillo Francisco Morazán invaded Guatemala with 1500 soldiers to avenge the insult done in Los Altos and fearing that such action would end liberal efforts to hold together the Central American Federation. Guatemala had a cordon of guards from the border with El Salvador; without telegraph service, men ran carrying last minute messages. With the information from these messengers, Carrera hatched a plan of defense leaving his brother Sotero with troops who presented a slight resistance in the city.

Carrera pretended to flee and led the ragtag army to the heights of Aceituno as only had about four men and the same number of loads rifle, plus two old cannons. The city was at the mercy of the army of Morazán, with bells of their twenty churches ringing for divine assistance. Once Morazán reached the capital, he took it easily and freed Guzman, who immediately left for Quetzaltenango to give the news that Carrera was defeated.

Carrera then took advantage of what his enemies believed and applied a strategy of concentrating fire on the Central Park of the city. His surprise attack tactics caused heavy casualties to the army of Morazán and forced the survivors to fight for their lives. In combat, Morazán&#x27;s soldiers lost the initiative and their numerical superiority. Furthermore, unaware of their surroundings in the city, Morazan&#x27;s troops had to fight, carry their dead and care for their wounded while still tired by the long march from El Salvador to Guatemala.

Carrera, by then an experienced military man was able to stand up and defeat Morazán thoroughly. The disaster for the liberal general was complete: aided by Angel Molina who knew the streets of the city, he had to flee with his favorite men, disguised and shouting &quot;Long live Carrera!&quot; through the ravine of &quot;El Incienso&quot; to El Salvador, to save his life. 

In his absence Morazán had been relieved as head of state of that country, and he had to embark for exile in Peru. In Guatemala, survivors from his troops were shot without mercy, as Carrera pursued Morazan, whom he failed to catch. This lance definitely sealed the status of General Carrera and marked the decline of Morazán, and forced the conservative criollos to negotiate with Carrera and his revolutionary peasant supporters.

Agustin Guzmán, freed by Morazán when the latter had seemingly defeated Carrera in Guatemala City, had gone back to Quetzaltenango with the good news. The city&#x27;s liberal criollo leaders rapidly reinstated the Los Altos State and celebrated Morazán&#x27;s victory. However, as soon as Carrera and the newly reinstated Mariano Rivera Paz heard the news, Carrera went back to Quetzaltenango with his volunteer army to regain control of the rebel liberal state once and for all.

On 2 April 1840, after entering the city, Carrera told the citizens that he had already warned them after he defeated them earlier that year. Then he ordered most of the liberal city hall officials from Los Altos shot. Carrera, then forcibly annexed Quetzaltenango and much of Los Altos back into conservative Guatemala.

After the violent and bloody reinstatement of the State of Los Altos by Carrera in April 1840, Luis Batres Juarros — conservative member of the Aycinena Clan, then secretary general of the Guatemalan government of recently reinstated Mariano Rivera Paz — obtained from the vicar Larrazabal authorization to dismantle the regionalist Church.

Active priests of Quetzaltenango — capital of the would-be-state of Los Altos — Urban Ugarte and José Maria Aguilar, were removed from their parish and likewise the priests of the parishes of San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Tolimán. Larrazabal ordered the priests Fernando Antonio Dávila, Mariano Navarrete and Jose Ignacio Iturrioz to cover the parishes of Quetzaltenango, San Martin Jilotepeque and San Lucas Toliman, respectively.

The defeat of the liberal criollos in Quetzaltenango reinforced Carrera allies&#x27; status within the native population of the area, whom he respected and protected as the leader of the peasant revolution.

Taking advantage of the chaos and unsettled situation, the Soconusco region was annexed by Mexico.

In 1844, 1848, and 1849, unsuccessful revolts against the dictatorship of Rafael Carrera briefly reproclaimed the independence of Los Altos.

== Second period of separation ==

During his first term as president, Rafael Carrera brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a traditional climate. However, in 1848, the liberals were able to force Rafael Carrera to leave office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months. Carrera resigned of his own free will and left for México. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law which they emphatically ordered the execution of Carrera if he dared to return to Guatemalan soil.

In his absence, the liberal criollos from Quetzaltenango — led by general Agustín Guzmán who occupied the city after Corregidor general Mariano Paredes was called to Guatemala City to take over the Presidential office— declared that Los Altos was an independent state once again on 26 August 1848; the new state had the support of Vasconcelos&#x27; regime in El Salvador and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz who were declared enemies of general Carrera. The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and the priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members.

On 5 September 1848, the criollo altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez. In the meantime, Carrera returned to Guatemala and entered by Huehuetenango, where he met with the native leaders and told them that they had to remain united to prevail. The leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started to develop a new Indian identity under Carrera&#x27;s leadership. In the meantime, in the eastern part of Guatemala, the Jalapa region became increasingly dangerous; former president Mariano Rivera Paz and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.

Upon learning that officer José Víctor Zavala had been appointed as Corregidor in Suchitepéquez, Carrera and his hundred jacalteco bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with jaguars to meet his former friend. When they met, Zavala not only did not capture him, but agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City, who realized that they were forced to negotiate with Carrera, otherwise they were going to have to battle on two fronts — Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.

Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in Suchitepéquez as a tactical maneuver. Carrera received a visit from a Cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he would keep them appeased. When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.

Agustín Guzmán went to Antigua Guatemala to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his hated enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean. Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when, in his absence, Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango. Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as Corregidor and convinced him that he should work with the K&#x27;iche&#x27;, Q’anjob’al, and Mam leaders to keep the region under control. On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: Now he is the King of the Indians, indeed!

The region is still distinctive, and &quot;Los Altos&quot; is still a nickname for the region of Guatemala around Quetzaltenango. Similarly, the Mexican portion of the former state is known as &quot;Los Altos de Chiapas&quot;.

<text>The Ashoka Chakra (Transl: Ashoka&#x27;s wheel) is an Indian symbol which is a depiction of the dharmachakra (English: &quot;wheel of dharma&quot;). It is so-called because it appears on a number of edicts of Ashoka the Great, most prominent among which is the Lion Capital of Ashoka. The most visible use of the Ashoka Chakra today is at the centre of the Flag of India (adopted on 22 July 1947), where it is rendered in a navy blue colour on a white background, replacing the symbol of &quot;charkha&quot; (spinning wheel) of the pre-independence versions of the flag. It is also shown in the Ashoka Chakra medal, which is the highest award for gallantry in peacetime.

== Symbolic history ==
When Gautama Buddha achieved enlightenment at Bodh Gaya, he came to Sarnath. There, he found his five disciples, Assaji, Mahānāman, Kondañña, Bhaddiya and Vappa, who had earlier abandoned him. He introduced his first teachings to them, thereby establishing the Dharmachakra. This is the motif taken up by Ashoka and portrayed on top of his pillars.

The 24 spokes represent the twelve causal links taught by the Buddha and paṭiccasamuppāda (Dependent Origination, Conditional Arising) in forward and then reverse order. The first 12 spokes represent 12 stages of suffering. The next 12 spokes represent no cause no effect. So, due to awareness of the mind, the formation of mental conditioning stops. This process stops the process of birth and death, i.e. nibbāna. It also depicts the “wheel of time”. The twelve causal links, paired with their corresponding symbols, are:
# Avidyā &quot;ignorance&quot;
# Saṅkhāra &quot;conditioning of mind unknowingly&quot;
# Vijñāna &quot; not being conscious&quot;
# Nāmarūpa &quot;name and form&quot; (constituent elements of mental and physical existence)
# Ṣalāyatana &quot;six senses&quot; (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind)
# Sparśa &quot;contact&quot;
# Vedanā &quot;sensation&quot;
# Taṇhā &quot;thirst&quot;
# Upādāna &quot;grasping&quot;
# Bhava &quot;coming to be&quot;
# Jāti &quot;birth&quot;
# Jarāmaraṇa &quot;old age and death&quot; – &quot;corpse being carried&quot;.
These 12 in forward and reverse represent a total 24 spokes representing the dharma.
The Ashoka Chakra depicts the 24 principles that should be present in a human.

== Inclusion in the national flag of India ==
Ashoka Chakra was included in the middle of the national flag of India. The chakra intends to show that there is life in movement and death in stagnation. Originally, the Indian flag was based on the &quot;&quot; flag, a flag of the Indian National Congress adopted by Mahatma Gandhi after making significant modifications to the design proposed by Pingali Venkayya. This flag included &quot;charkha&quot; which was replaced with &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot; by the proposal of Ambedkar.

<text>RONJA (Reasonable Optical Near Joint Access) is a free-space optical communication system developed in the Czech Republic by Karel Kulhavý of Twibright Labs. Released in 2001. It transmits data wirelessly using beams of light. Ronja can be used to create a 10 Mbit/s full duplex Ethernet point-to-point link. It has been estimated that 1,000 to 2,000 links have been built worldwide.

The basic configuration has a range of . The device consists of a receiver and transmitter pipe (optical head) mounted on a sturdy adjustable holder. Two coaxial cables are used to connect the rooftop installation with a protocol translator installed in the house near a computer or switch. By doubling or tripling the transmitter pipe, the range can be extended to 1.9 km (1.2 mi).

Building instructions, blueprints, and schematics are published under the GNU Free Documentation License, with development using only free software tools. The author calls this level of freedom &quot;User Controlled Technology&quot;. Ronja is a project of Twibright Labs.

== Manufacture ==

The building instructions are written with an inexperienced builder in mind. Basic operations like drilling, soldering etc., are explained. Several techniques – drilling templates, detailed checks after soldering, testing procedures – are employed to minimize errors at critical places and help to speed up work. Printed circuit boards are downloadable ready for manufacture, with instructions for the fabhouse. People with no previous experience with building electronics have reported on the mailing list that the device ran on the first try.

154 installations worldwide have been registered into a gallery with technical data and pictures.

== Range ==
With the brightest variant of Lumileds HPWT-BD00-F4000 LED and 130 mm diameter cheap magnifying glass lenses, the range is . The dimmer but more affordable E4000 variant of HPWT-BD00 yields . The speed is always 10 Mbit/s full duplex regardless of the distance.

== Models ==

* &quot;Ronja Tetrapolis&quot;: Range of , red visible light. Connect with 8P8C connector into a network card or switch.
* &quot;Ronja 10M Metropolis&quot;: Range of , red visible light. Connects to Attachment Unit Interface.
* &quot;Ronja Inferno&quot;: Range of , invisible infrared light.
* &quot;Ronja Benchpress&quot;: A measurement device for developers for physical measurement of lens/LED combination gain and calculation of range from that
* &quot;Ronja Lopipe&quot;: The original (discontinued) design using red visible light and a RS232 interface for a max 115 kbit/s PPP/SLIP link.

== Limitations ==
By definition, clear visibility between the transmitter and receiver is essential. If the beam is obscured in any way, the link will stop working. Typically, problems may occur during conditions of snow or dense fog. One device weighs and requires 70 hours of building time. It requires an ability to set full duplex manually on the network card or switch to take advantage of full duplex, since it doesn&#x27;t support autonegotiation. Must be plugged directly into PC or switch using the integral Ethernet cable.

== Technology ==
A complete RONJA system is made up of 2 transceivers: 2 optical transmitters and 2 optical receivers. They are assembled individually or as a combination. The complete system layout is shown in the block diagram.

=== Optical receiver – Preamplifier stage ===
The usual approach in FSO (Free Space Optics) preamplifiers is to employ a transimpedance amplifier. A transimpedance amplifier is a very sensitive broadband high-speed device featuring a feedback loop. This fact means the layout is plagued with stability problems and special compensation of PIN diode capacitance must be performed, therefore this doesn&#x27;t allow selection of a wide range of cheap PIN photodiodes with varying capacitances.

Ronja however uses a feedbackless design where the PIN has a high working electrical resistance (100 kilohms) which together with the total input capacitance (roughly 8 pF, 5 pF PIN and 3 pF input MOSFET cascode) makes the device operate with a passband on a 6 dB/oct slope of low pass formed by PIN working resistance and total input capacitance. The signal is then immediately amplified to remove the danger of contamination by signal noise, and then a compensation of the 6 dB/oct slope is done by derivator element on the programming pins of an NE592 video amplifier. A surprisingly flat characteristic is obtained. If the PIN diode is equipped with 3 kΩ working resistor to operate in flat band mode, the range is reduced to about 30% due to thermal noise from the 3 kΩ resistor.

=== Optical transmitter – Nebulus infrared LED driver ===

The HSDL4220 infrared LED is originally unsuitable for 10 Mbit/s operation. It has a bandwidth of 9 MHz, where 10 Mbit/s Manchester-modulated systems need bandwidth of around 16 MHz. Operation in a usual circuit with current drive would lead to substantial signal corruption and range reduction. Therefore, Twibright Labs developed a special driving technique consisting of driving the LED directly with 15-fold 74AC04 gate output in parallel with RF voltage applied current-unlimited directly to the LED through large capacitors. As the voltage to keep the nominal LED average current (100mA) varies with temperature and component tolerances, an AC-bypassed current sense resistor is put in series with the LED. A feedback loop measures voltage on this resistor and keeps it at a preset level by varying supply voltage of the 74AC04 gates. Therefore, the nominally digital 74AC04 is operating as a structured power CMOS switch completely in analog mode.

This way the LED junction is flooded and cleared of carriers as quickly as possible, basically by short circuit discharge. This pushes the speed of the LED to maximum, which makes the output optical signal fast enough so that the range/power ratio is the same as with the faster red HPWT-BD00-F4000 LED. The side effects of this brutal driving
technique are: 1) the LED overshoots at the beginning of longer (5 MHz/1 MHz) impulses to about 2x brightness. This was measured to have no adverse effect on range. 2) A blocking ceramic capacitor bank backing up the 74AC04 switching array is crucial for correct operation, because charging and discharging the LED is done by short circuit. Under dimensioning this bank causes the leading and trailing edges of the optical output to grow longer.

=== Transceiver – Ronja Twister ===

Ronja Twister is an electronic interface for free space optical datalink based on counter and shift register chips. It is a part of the Ronja design. It is effectively an optical Ethernet transceiver without the optical drive part.

The original design has been superseded with Twister2 but the logic circuit remained the same.

== Open source hardware approach ==

Soderberg, studying Ronja sociologically, writes: &quot;Arguably, the first project that vindicated the methods and licensing schemes of free software development, applied those practices to open hardware development, and pulled off a state-of-the-art technology without any backing from universities or firms, was the Ronja project.&quot;

The whole toolchain is built strictly upon free tools and the source files are provided, free, under the GPL. This allows anyone to enter the development, start manufacture or invest into the technology without entry costs. Such costs normally can include software licence costs, time investment into resolution of compatibility issues between proprietary applications, or costs of intellectual property licence negotiations. The decision to conceive the project this way was inspired by observed organizational efficiency of Free Software.

On Christmas 2001, Ronja became the world&#x27;s first 10 Mbit/s Free Space Optics device with free sources.

<text>Gia Long (Chữ hán: 嘉隆) ( , ; 8 February 1762 – 3 February 1820), born Nguyễn Phúc Ánh (阮福暎) or Nguyễn Ánh (阮暎), was the founding emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty, the last dynasty of Vietnam. His dynasty would rule the unified territories that constitute modern-day Vietnam until 1945.

A nephew of the last Nguyễn lord who ruled over south Vietnam, Nguyễn Ánh was forced into hiding in 1777 as a fifteen-year-old when his family was slain in the Tây Sơn revolt. After several changes of fortune in which his loyalists regained and again lost Saigon, he befriended the French Catholic Bishop Pierre Pigneau de Behaine. Pigneau championed Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s cause to regain the throne to the French government and managed to recruit volunteers, however that soon fell through. From 1789, Nguyễn Ánh was once again in the ascendancy and began his northward march to defeat the Tây Sơn, reaching the border with the Qing dynasty by 1802, which had previously been under the control of the Trịnh lords. Following their defeat, he succeeded in reuniting Vietnam after centuries of internecine feudal warfare, with a greater landmass than ever before, stretching from the Qing&#x27;s borders down to the Gulf of Siam.

Gia Long&#x27;s rule was noted for its Confucian orthodoxy. He defeated the Tây Sơn rebellion and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country&#x27;s populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up several fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam&#x27;s defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and turning it into a vassal state.

==Early years==

Born in Phú Xuân (modern-day Huế, central Vietnam) on 8 February 1762, he also had two other names in his childhood: Nguyễn Phúc Chủng (阮福種) and Nguyễn Phúc Noãn (阮福暖). Nguyễn Ánh was the third son of Nguyễn Phúc Luân and Nguyễn Thị Hoàn. Luan was the second son of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát of southern Vietnam; the first son had already predeceased the incumbent Lord. There are differing accounts on which son was the designated successor. According to one theory, Luân was the designated heir, but a high-ranking mandarin named Trương Phúc Loan changed Khoat&#x27;s will of succession on his deathbed, and installed Luan&#x27;s younger brother Nguyễn Phúc Thuần, the sixteenth son, on the throne in 1765. Luan was jailed and died in the 1765, the same year as Thuan&#x27;s installation. However, the historian Choi Byung Wook claims that the notion that Luân was the designated heir was based on fact but was propagated by 19th century Nguyễn dynasty historians after Nguyễn Ánh had taken the throne as Gia Long to establish the emperor&#x27;s legitimacy. According to Choi, Lord Khoát had originally chosen the ninth son, who then died, leaving Loan to install Lord Thuần. At the time, the alternative was the eldest son of the ninth son, Nguyễn Phúc Dương, whom opposition groups later tried unsuccessfully to convince to join them as a figurehead to lend legitimacy. In 1775, Thuan was forced to share power with Dương by military leaders who supported the Nguyêns. At this time, Nguyễn Ánh was a minor member of the family and did not have any political support among court powerbrokers.

However, Thuan lost his position as lord of southern Vietnam and was killed, along with Duong, during the Tây Sơn rebellion led by the brothers Nguyễn Nhạc, Nguyễn Huệ and Nguyễn Lữ in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh was the most senior member of the ruling family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory, which pushed the Nguyễn from their heartland in central Vietnam, southwards towards Saigon and into the Mekong Delta region in the far south. This turn of events changed the nature of the Nguyễn power hierarchy; the family and the first leader Nguyễn Hoàng had originally come from Thanh Hoa Province in northern Vietnam, and this is where most of their senior military and civil leadership&#x27;s heritage derived from, but as a result of the Tây Sơn&#x27;s initial successes, much of this old power base was destroyed and Nguyễn Ánh had to rebuild his support network among southerners, who later became the core of the regime when the Nguyễn dynasty was established.

Nguyễn Ánh was sheltered by a Catholic priest Paul Nghi (Phaolô Hồ Văn Nghị) in Rạch Giá. Later, he fled to Hà Tiên on the southern coastal tip of Vietnam, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his advisor and played a major part in his rise to power. Receiving information from Paul Nghi, Pigneau avoided the Tay Son army in Cambodia, and came back to assist Nguyễn Ánh. They hid in the forest to avoid the pursuit of Tay Son army. Together, they escaped to the island of Pulo Panjang in the Gulf of Siam. Pigneau hoped that by playing a substantial role in a Nguyễn Ánh victory, he would be in position to lever important concessions for the Catholic Church in Vietnam, helping its expansion in Southeast Asia.

In late 1777, the main part of the Tây Sơn army left Saigon to go north and attack the Trịnh lords, who ruled the other half of Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh stealthily returned to the mainland, rejoining his supporters and reclaimed the city of Saigon. He was crucially aided by the efforts of Do Thanh Nhon, a senior Nguyễn Lord commander who had organized an army for him, which was supplemented by Cambodian mercenaries and Chinese pirates. The following year, Nhon expelled additional Tây Sơn troops from the surrounding province of Gia Dinh and inflicted heavy losses on the Tây Sơn naval fleet. Taking advantage of the more favorable situation, Nguyễn Ánh sent a diplomatic mission to Siam to propose a treaty of friendship. This potential pact, however, was derailed in 1779 when the Cambodians rose up against their pro-Siamese leader Ang Non II. Nguyễn Ánh sent Nhon to assist the revolt, which eventually saw Ang Non II defeated decisively and executed.

Nhon returned to Saigon with high honor and concentrated his efforts on improving the Nguyễn navy. In 1780, in an attempt to strengthen his political status, Nguyễn Ánh proclaimed himself Nguyễn vương (&quot;Nguyễn king&quot; or &quot;Nguyễn ruler&quot; in Vietnamese) with the support of Nhon&#x27;s Dông Sơn Army. In 1781, Nguyễn Ánh sent further forces to prop up the Cambodian regime against Siamese armies who wanted to reassert their control. Shortly thereafter, Nguyễn Ánh had Nhon brutally murdered. The reason remains unclear, but it was postulated that he did so because Nhon&#x27;s fame and military success was overshadowing him. At the time, Nhon had much, if not dominant power, behind the scenes. According to later Nguyễn dynasty chronicles, Nhon&#x27;s powers included that of deciding who would receive the death penalty, and allocating budget expenditures. Nhon also refused to allocate money for royal spending. Nhon and his men were also reported to have acted in an abrasive and disrespectful manner to Nguyễn Ánh.

The Tây Sơn brothers reportedly broke out in celebration upon hearing of Nhon&#x27;s execution, as Nhon was the Nguyễn officer whom they feared the most. Large parts of Nhon&#x27;s supporters rebelled, weakening the Nguyễn army, and within a few months, the Tây Sơn had recaptured Saigon mainly on the back of naval barrages. Nguyễn Ánh was forced to flee to Ha Tien, and then onto the island of Phu Quoc. Meanwhile, some of his forces continued to resist in his absence. While the murder of Nhon weakened Nguyễn Ánh in the short term, as many southerners who were personally loyal to Nhon broke away and counter-attacked, it also allowed Nguyễn Ánh to gain autonomy and then take steps towards exerting direct control over the remaining local forces of the Dong Son who were willing to work with him. Nguyễn Ánh also benefited from the support of Chau Van Tiep, who had a power base in the central highlands between the strongholds of the Nguyễn and the Tây Sơn.

In October 1782, the tide shifted again, when forces led by Nguyễn Phúc Mân, Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s younger brother, and Chau Van Tiep drove the Tây Sơn out of Saigon. Nguyễn Ánh returned to Saigon, as did Pigneau The hold was tenuous, and a counterattack by the Tây Sơn in early 1783 saw a heavy defeat to the Nguyễn, with Nguyen Man killed in battle. Nguyễn Ánh again fled to Phu Quoc, but this time his hiding place was discovered. He managed to escape the pursuing Tây Sơn fleet to Koh-rong island in the Bay of Kompongsom. Again, his hideout was discovered and encircled by the rebel fleet. However, a typhoon hit the area, and he managed to break the naval siege and escape to another island amid the confusion. In early-1784, Nguyễn Ánh went to seek Siamese aid, which was forthcoming, but the extra 20,000 men failed to weaken the Tây Sơn&#x27;s hold on power. This forced Nguyễn Ánh to become a refugee in Siam in 1785. To make matters worse, the Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice-growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, depriving the Nguyễn of their food supply. Nguyễn Ánh eventually came to the conclusion that using Siamese military aid would generate a backlash among the populace, due to prevailing Vietnamese hostility towards Siam.

==Pigneau and French assistance==
Deflated by his situation, Nguyễn Ánh asked Pigneau to appeal for French aid, and allowed Pigneau to take his son Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh with him as a sign of good faith. This came about after Nguyễn Ánh had considered enlisting English, Dutch, Portuguese and Spanish assistance. Pigneau advised against Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s original plan to seek Dutch aid from Batavia, fearing that the support of the Protestant Dutch would hinder the advancement of Catholicism. Pigneau left Vietnam in December, arriving in Pondicherry, India in February 1785 with Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s royal seal. Nguyễn Ánh had authorized him to make concessions to France in return for military assistance. The French administration in Pondicherry, led by acting governor Coutenceau des Algrains, was conservative in outlook and resolutely opposed intervention in southern Vietnam. To compound the already complex situation, Pigneau was denounced by Spanish Franciscans in the Vatican, and he sought to transfer his political mandate to Portuguese forces. The Portuguese had earlier offered Nguyễn Ánh 56 ships to use against the Tây Sơn.

In July 1786, after more than 12 months of fruitless lobbying in Pondicherry, Governor de Cossigny allowed Pigneau to travel back to France to directly ask the royal court for assistance. Arriving at the court of Louis XVI in Versailles in February 1787, Pigneau had difficulty in gathering support for a French expedition in support of Nguyễn Ánh. This was due to the parlous financial state of the country prior to the French Revolution. Pigneau was helped by Pierre Poivre, who had previously been involved in seeking French commercial interests in Vietnam. Pigneau told the court that if France invested in Nguyễn Ánh and acquired a few fortified positions on the Vietnamese coast in return, then they would have the capability to &quot;dominate the seas of China and of the archipelago&quot;, and with it, control of Asian commerce. In November 1787, a treaty of alliance was concluded between France and Cochinchina, the European term for southern Vietnam, in Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s name. Pigneau signed the treaty as the &quot;Royal Commissioner of France for Cochinchina&quot;. France promised four frigates, 1,650 fully equipped French soldiers and 250 Indian sepoys in return for the cession of Poulo-Condore (Côn Đảo) and Tourane (Da Nang), as well as tree trade to the exclusion of all other countries. However, the freedom to spread Christianity was not included. However, Pigneau found that Governor Thomas Conway of Pondicherry was unwilling to fulfill the agreement; Conway had been instructed by Paris to determine when to organize the aid, if at all. Pigneau was thus forced to use funds raised in France to enlist French volunteers and mercenaries. He also managed to procure several shipments of arms and munitions from Mauritius and Pondicherry.
Meanwhile, the Royal Court of Siam in Bangkok, under King Rama I, warmly welcomed Nguyễn Ánh. The Vietnamese refugees were allowed to build a small village between Samsen and Bangpho, and named it &quot;Long-kỳ&quot; (Thai: &quot;Lat Tonpho&quot;). Ánh had stayed in Siam with a contingent of troops until August 1787. His soldiers served in Siam&#x27;s war against Bodawpaya of Burma (1785–86). On 18 December 1786, Nguyễn Ánh signed a treaty of alliance with the Portuguese in Bangkok. In the next year, António (&quot;An Tôn Lỗi&quot;), a Portuguese from Goa, came to Bangkok, brought Western soldiers and warships to Ánh. This disgusted the Siamese and Ánh had to refuse the aid from Portuguese. After this incident, Ánh was no longer trusted by the Siamese.

Having consolidated their hold on southern Vietnam, the Tây Sơn decided to move north to unify the country. However, the withdrawal of troops from the Gia Dinh garrison weakened their hold on the south. This was compounded by reports that Nguyễn Nhạc was being attacked near Qui Nhơn by his own brother Nguyễn Huệ, and that more Tây Sơn troops were being evacuated from Gia Dinh by their commander Dang Van Tran in order to aid Nguyễn Nhạc. Sensing Tây Sơn vulnerability in the south, Nguyễn Ánh assembled his forces at home and abroad in preparation for an immediate offensive.
Ánh secretly left Siam in the night, leaving a letter in his house, he decided to head for southern Vietnam by boat. As the Vietnamese refugees were preparing to leave, people nearby heard about it and reported it to Phraya Phrakhlang. Phraya Phrakhlang reported it to King Rama I and the Front Palace Maha Sura Singhanat. Sura Singhanat was extremely angry, he chased them personally. At dawn, Sura Singhanat saw Ánh&#x27;s boat at the mouth of the bay. Finally, the Vietnamese escaped successfully. Ánh arrived at Hà Tiên then to Long Xuyên (Cà Mau), but he failed in his first attempt to recapture Gia Dinh, having failed to convince the local warlord in the Mekong Delta, Vo Tanh to join his assault. The following year, Nguyễn Ánh finally managed to persuade the warlord to join him but after having given his sister to the warlord as a concubine. He eventually succeeded in taking Mỹ Tho, made it the main staging point for his operations, and rebuilt his army. After a hard-fought battle, his soldiers captured Saigon on 7 September 1788. Eventually, Pigneau assembled four vessels to sail to Vietnam from Pondicherry, arriving in Saigon on 24 July 1789. The combined forces helped to consolidate Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s hold on southern Vietnam. The exact magnitude of foreign aid and the importance of their contribution to Gia Long&#x27;s success is a point of dispute. Earlier scholars asserted that up to 400 Frenchmen enlisted, but more recent work has claimed that less than 100 soldiers were present, along with approximately a dozen officers.

==Consolidation of Southern Annam==
After more than a decade of conflict, Nguyễn Ánh had finally managed to gain control of Saigon for long enough to have time to start a permanent base in the area and prepare to build up for a decisive power struggle with the Tây Sơn. The area around Saigon, known as Gia Dinh, began to be referred to as its own region, because Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s presence was becoming entrenched, distinguishing and associating the area with a political base. Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s military was able to consolidate, and a civil service was reestablished. According to the historian Keith Taylor, this was the first time that the southern third of Vietnam was integrated &quot;as a region capable of participating successfully in war and politics among Vietnamese speakers&quot;, which could &quot;compete for ascendancy with all the other places inhabited by speakers of the Vietnamese language&quot;. A Council of High Officials consisting of military and civil officials was created in 1788, as was a tax collection system. In the same year, regulations were passed to force half the male population of Gia Dinh to serve as conscripts, and two years later, a system of military colonies was implemented to bolster the Nguyễn support base across all racial groups, including ethnic Khmers and Chinese.

The French officers enlisted by Pigneau helped to train Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s armed forces and introduced Western technological expertise to the war effort. The navy was trained by Jean-Marie Dayot, who supervised the construction of bronze-plated naval vessels. Olivier de Puymanel was responsible for training the army and the construction of fortifications. He introduced European infantry training, formations and tactics while also facilitating various methods of manufacturing and using European-style artillery, thereby making cannonry and projectiles a central part of the military. Pigneau and other missionaries acted as business agents for Nguyễn Ánh, purchasing munitions and other military matériel. Pigneau also served as an advisor and de facto foreign minister until his death in 1799. Upon Pigneau&#x27;s death, Gia Long&#x27;s funeral oration described the Frenchman as &quot;the most illustrious foreigner ever to appear at the court of Cochinchina&quot;. Pigneau was buried in the presence of the crown prince, all mandarins of the court, the royal bodyguard of 12,000 men and 40,000 mourners.

===Fortifications===
Following the recapture of Saigon, Nguyễn Ánh consolidated his power base and prepared the destruction of the Tây Sơn. His enemies had regularly raided the south and looted the annual rice harvests, so Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his defence. One of Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s first actions was to ask the French officers to design and supervise the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel, with 30,000 people mobilized for its construction in 1790. The townsfolk and the mandarins were punitively taxed for the work and the laborers were so over-worked that they revolted. When finished, the stone citadel had a perimeter measuring 4,176 meters in a Vauban model. The fortress was bordered on three sides by pre-existing waterways, bolstering its natural defensive capability. Following the construction of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to sail down the Saigon River and try to recapture the city, its presence having endowed Nguyễn Ánh with a substantial psychological advantage over his opponents. Nguyễn Ánh took a keen personal interest in fortifications, ordering his French advisors to travel home and bring back books with the latest scientific and technical studies on the subject. The Nguyễn royal palace was built inside the citadel.

===Agricultural reform and economic growth===
With the southern region secured, Nguyễn Ánh turned his attention to agricultural reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop via inland waterways, the area suffered chronic rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited, having been occupied by Vietnamese settlers only relatively recently. Furthermore, agricultural activities had also been significantly curtailed during the extended warfare with the Tây Sơn. Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s agricultural reforms were based around extending to the south a traditional form of agrarian expansion, the &quot;đồn điền&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;military settlement&quot; or &quot;military holding&quot;, the emphasis being on the military origin of this form of colonization. These were first used during the 15th-century reign of Lê Thánh Tông in the southward expansion of Vietnam. The central government supplied military units with agricultural tools and grain for nourishment and planting. The soldiers were then assigned land to defend, clear and cultivate, and had to pay some of their harvest as tax. In the past, a military presence was required because the land had been seized from the conquered indigenous population. Under Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s rule, pacification was not usually needed but the basic model remained intact. Settlers were granted fallow land, given agricultural equipment, work animals, and grain. After several years, they were required to pay grain tax. The program greatly reduced the amount of idle, uncultivated land. Large surpluses of grain, taxable by the state, soon resulted.

By 1800, the increased agricultural productivity had allowed Nguyễn Ánh to support a sizeable army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was sold to European and Asian traders to facilitate the importation of raw materials for military purposes, in particular iron, bronze, and sulfur. The government also purchased caster sugar from local farmers and traded it for weapons from European manufacturers. The food surplus allowed Nguyễn Ánh to engage in welfare initiatives that improved morale and loyalty among his subjects, thereby increasing his support base. The surplus grain was deposited in granaries built along the northward route out of Saigon, following the advance of the Nguyễn army into Tây Sơn territory. This allowed his troops to be fed from southern supplies, rather than eating from the areas that he was attempting to conquer or win over. Newly acquired regions were given tax exemptions, and surrendered Tây Sơn mandarins were appointed to equivalent positions with the same salaries in the Nguyễn administration.

===Naval buildup===

Nguyễn Ánh used his new Chu Su Naval workshop to improve his inferior navy, which was much smaller than the Tây Sơn fleet and hitherto unable to prevent their rice raids. Nguyễn Ánh had first attempted to acquire modern naval vessels in 1781, when on the advice of Pigneau, he had chartered Portuguese vessels of European design, complete with crew and artillery. This initial experience proved to be disastrous. For reasons that remain unclear, two of the vessels fled in the midst of the battle against the Tây Sơn, while angry Vietnamese soldiers killed the third crew. In 1789, Pigneau returned to Vietnam from Pondicherry with two vessels, which stayed in the Nguyễn service long-term. Over time, Vietnamese sailors replaced the original French and Indian crew under the command of French officers. These vessels became the foundation for an expanded military and merchant Nguyen naval force, with Nguyễn Ánh chartering and purchasing more European vessels to reinforce Vietnamese-built ships. However, traditional Vietnamese-style galleys and small sailing ships remained the mainstay of the fleet. By 1794, two European vessels were operating together with 200 Vietnamese boats against the Tây Sơn near Qui Nhơn. In 1799, a British trader by the name of Berry reported that the Nguyễn fleet had departed Saigon along the Saigon River with 100 galleys, 40 junks, 200 smaller boats, and 800 carriers, accompanied by three European sloops. In 1801, one naval division was reported to have included nine European vessels armed with 60 guns, five vessels with 50 guns, 40 with 16 guns, 100 junks, 119 galleys, and 365 smaller boats.

Most of the European-style vessels were built in the shipyard that Nguyễn Ánh had commissioned in Saigon. He took a deep personal interest in the naval program, directly supervising the work and spending several hours a day at the dockside. One witness noted &quot;One principal tendency of his ambition is to naval science, as a proof of this he has been heard to say he would build ships of the line on the European plan.&quot; By 1792, fifteen frigates were under construction, with a design that mixed Chinese and European specifications, equipped with 14 guns. The Vietnamese learned European naval architecture by dismantling an old European vessel into its components, so that Vietnamese shipbuilders could understand the separate facets of European shipbuilding, before reassembling it. They then applied their newfound knowledge to create replicas of the boats. Nguyễn Ánh studied naval carpentry techniques and was said to be adept at it, and learned navigational theory from the French books that Pigneau translated, particularly Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The Saigon shipyard was widely praised by European travelers.

Despite his extensive reliance on French officers in matters of military technology, Nguyễn Ánh limited his inner military circle to loyal Vietnamese. The Frenchmen decried his refusal to take their tactical advice. Chaigneau reported that the Europeans continually urged Nguyễn Ánh to take the initiative and launch bold attacks against Tây Sơn installations. Nguyễn Ánh refused, preferring to proceed slowly, consolidating his gains in one area and strengthening his economic and military base, before attacking another. In the first four years after establishing himself in Saigon in 1788, Nguyễn Ánh focused on tightening his grip on the Gia Dinh area and its productive rice paddies, and although his forces exerted a degree on control over areas to the north such as Khanh Hoa, Phu Yen and Binh Thuan, their main presence in the northern areas were mainly through naval forces and not concentrated on land occupation. This was because those areas were not very fertile in terms of rice production and were often affected by famines, and occupying the land would have meant an obligation to feed the populace, putting a strain on resources. During this four-year period, Nguyễn Ánh sent missions to Siam, Cambodia and south to the Straits of Malacca and purchased more European military equipment.

Over time, Nguyễn Ánh gradually reduced the military role of his French allies on the battlefield. In the naval battle at Thi Nai in 1792, Dayot led the Nguyễn naval attack, but by 1801, a seaborne offensive in the same area was led by Nguyen Van Truong, Vo Duy Nguy and Lê Văn Duyệt, with Chaigneau, Vannier, and de Forsans in supporting positions. The infantry attack on Qui Nhơn in 1793 was conducted, according to Nguyen historiography, in cooperation with &quot;Western soldiers&quot;. The same source recorded that by 1801, Nguyen operations in the same area were directed by Vietnamese generals, whereas Chaigneau and Vannier were responsible for organizing supply lines.

== Unification of Vietnam ==
In 1792, the middle and the most notable of the three Tây Sơn brothers, Nguyễn Huệ Quang Trung, who had gained recognition as Emperor of Vietnam by driving the Lê dynasty and China out of northern Vietnam, died suddenly. Nguyễn Ánh took advantage of the situation and attacked northwards. By now, the majority of the original French soldiers, whose number peaked at less than 80 by some estimates, had departed. The majority of the fighting occurred in and around the coastal towns of Nha Trang in central Vietnam and Qui Nhơn further to the north in Bình Định Province, the birthplace and stronghold of the Tây Sơn.
Nguyễn Ánh began by deploying his expanded and modernized naval fleet in raids against coastal Tây Sơn territory. His fleet left Saigon and sailed northward on an annual basis during June and July, carried by southwesterly winds. The naval offensives were reinforced by infantry campaigns. His fleet would then return south when the monsoon ended, on the back of northeasterly winds. The large European wind-powered vessels gave the Nguyễn navy a commanding artillery advantage, as they had a superior range to the Tây Sơn cannons on the coast. Combined with traditional galleys and a crew that was highly regarded for its discipline, skill and bravery, the European-style vessels in the Nguyễn fleet inflicted hundreds of losses against the Tây Sơn in 1792 and 1793.

In 1794, after a successful campaign in the Nha Trang region, Nguyễn Ánh ordered de Puymanel to build a citadel at Duyen Khanh, near the city, instead of retreating south with the seasonal northeasterly breeze. A Nguyen garrison was established there under the command of Nguyễn Ánh&#x27;s eldest son and heir, Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh, assisted by Pigneau and de Puymanel. The Tây Sơn laid siege to Duyen Khanh in May 1794, but Nguyen forces were able to keep them out. Shortly after the siege ended, reinforcements arrived from Saigon and offensive operations against the Tây Sơn duly resumed. The campaign was the first time that the Nguyễn were able to operate in Tây Sơn heartland during an unfavorable season. The defensive success of the citadel was a powerful psychological victory for the Nguyễn, demonstrating their ability to penetrate Tây Sơn territory at any time of the year. The Nguyễn then proceeded to slowly erode the Tây Sơn heartland.

Heavy fighting occurred at the fortress of Qui Nhơn until it was captured in 1799 by Nguyen Canh&#x27;s forces. However, the city was quickly lost and was not regained until 1801. The superior firepower of the improved navy played the decisive role in the ultimate recapture of the city, supporting a large overland attack. With the capture of their stronghold at Qui Nhơn, the vanquishing of the Tây Sơn was inevitable. In June, the central city of Huế, the former capital of the Nguyễn, fell and Nguyễn Ánh crowned himself emperor, under the reign name Gia Long. A common modern myth about this reign title is that was derived from &quot;Gia Định&quot; (Saigon) and
&quot;Thăng Long&quot; (Hanoi) to symbolise the unification of northern and southern Vietnam, despite no contemporary evidence supporting this. He then quickly overran the north, with Hanoi captured on 22 July 1802. After a quarter-century of continuous fighting, Gia Long had unified these formerly fractious territories, ultimately leading what is now modern Vietnam and elevated his family to a position never previously occupied by any Vietnamese royalty. Vietnam had never before occupied a larger landmass. Gia Long became the first Vietnamese ruler to reign over territory stretching from China in the north, all the way to the Gulf of Siam and the Cà Mau peninsula in the south. Gia Long&#x27;s then petitioned the Qing dynasty of China for official recognition, which was promptly granted. The French failure to honor the treaty signed by Pigneau meant Vietnam was not bound to cede the territory and trading rights that they had promised.

Due to a Tây Sơn massacre of ethnic Chinese, the Nguyễn were subsequently supported by most ethnic Chinese against the Tây Sơn. The Tây Sơn&#x27;s downfall and defeat at the hands of Nguyễn Phúc Ánh was therefore due, at least in part, to the ethnic Chinese support given the Nguyễn.

==Rule==
Gia Long&#x27;s rule was noted for its strict Confucian orthodoxy. Upon toppling the Tây Sơn, he repealed their reforms and reimposed classical Confucian education and civil service systems. He moved the capital from Hanoi in the north to Huế in central Vietnam to reflect the southward migration of the population over the preceding centuries. The Emperor built new fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, Gia Long modernized Vietnam&#x27;s defensive capabilities and, in recognition of the assistance of his French friends, he permitted the activities of Catholic missionaries, something, however, which was less tolerated by his successors. Under Gia Long&#x27;s rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siam from Cambodia and turning it into a vassal state. Despite this, he was relatively isolationist in outlook towards European powers.

===Renaming Vietnam===
Gia Long decided to join the Imperial Chinese Tributary System. He sent an embassy to Qing China and requested to change his country&#x27;s name to Nam Việt (南越). Gia Long explained that the word Nam Việt derived from An Nam (安南) and Việt Thường (越裳), two toponyms mentioned in ancient Chinese records that were located in northern and southern Vietnam respectively, to symbolize the unification of the country. The Qing Jiaqing Emperor of China refused his request because it had an identical name with the ancient kingdom of Nam Việt (Nanyue), and the territory of Nam Việt contained Liangguang which belonged to Qing China at that time. Instead, Jiaqing agreed to change it to Việt Nam (越南). Gia Long&#x27;s &quot;Đại Nam thực lục&quot; contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming.

However, Gia Long copied the Imperial Chinese system, basing it on the Chinese Confucian model and attempting to create a Vietnamese Imperial tributary system. In 1805, Gia Long used &quot;Trung Quốc&quot; (中國), the very same word and characters used to refer to China, as a name for Vietnam.

It was said &quot;&quot;Hán di hữu hạn&quot; (, &quot;the Vietnamese and the barbarians must have clear borders&quot;&quot;) by the Gia Long Emperor (Nguyễn Phúc Ánh) when differentiating between Khmer and Vietnamese. Minh Mạng implemented an acculturation integration policy directed at minority non-Vietnamese peoples. &quot;Thanh nhân&quot; (清人 &quot;Qingren&quot;) was used to refer to ethnic Chinese by the Vietnamese while Vietnamese called themselves as &quot;Hán nhân&quot; (漢人 &quot;Hanren&quot;) in Vietnam during the 1800s under Nguyễn rule.

===Administrative structure===

During the war era, Nguyễn Ánh had maintained an embryonic bureaucracy in an attempt to prove his leadership ability to the people. Due to the incessant warfare, military officers were generally the most prominent members of his inner circle. This dependency on military backing continued to manifest itself throughout his reign. Vietnam was divided into three administrative regions. The old patrimony of the Nguyễn formed the central part of the empire (&quot;vùng Kinh Kỳ&quot;), with nine provinces, five of which were directly ruled by Gia Long and his mandarins from Huế. The central administration at Huế was divided into six ministries: Public affairs, finance, rites, war, justice, and public works. Each was under a minister, assisted by two deputies and two or three councilors. Each of these ministries had around 70 employees assigned to various units. The heads of these ministries formed the Supreme Council. A treasurer-general and a Chief of the Judicial Service assisted a governor-general, who was in charge of a number of provinces. The provinces were classified into &quot;trấn&quot; and &quot;dinh&quot;. These were in turn divided into &quot;phủ&quot;, &quot;huyện&quot; and &quot;châu&quot;. All important matters were examined by the Supreme Council in the presence of Gia Long. The officials tabled their reports for discussion and decision-making. The bureaucrats involved in the Supreme Council were selected from the high-ranking mandarins of the six ministries and the academies.

Gia Long handled the northern and southern regions of Vietnam cautiously, not wanting them to be jarred by rapid centralization after centuries of national division. Tonkin, with the administrative seat of its imperial military protector (&quot;quan tổng trấn&quot;) at Hanoi, had thirteen provinces (&quot;tổng trấn Bắc Thành&quot;), and in the Red River Delta, the old officials of the Le administration continued in office. In the south, Saigon was the capital of the four provinces of Cochinchina (&quot;tổng trấn Gia Định&quot;), as well as the seat of the military protector. The citadels in the respective cities directly administered their military defense zones. This system allowed Gia Long to reward his leading supporters with highly powerful positions, giving them almost total autonomy in ordinary administrative and legal matters. This system persisted until 1831–32, when his son Minh Mạng centralized the national government.

In his attempts to re-establish a stable administration after centuries of civil war, Gia Long was not regarded as being innovative, preferring the traditional administration framework. When Gia Long unified the country, it was described by Charles Maybon as being chaotic: &quot;The wheels of administration were warped or no longer existed; the cadres of officials were empty, the hierarchy destroyed; taxes were not being collected, lists of communal property had disappeared, proprietary titles were lost, fields abandoned; roads bridges and public granaries had not been maintained; work in the mines had ceased. The administration of justice had been interrupted, every province was a prey to pirates, and violation of law went unpunished, while even the law itself had become uncertain.&quot;

===Foreign military relations===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Cambodian empire had been in decline and Vietnamese people migrated south into the Mekong Delta, which had previously been Khmer territory. Furthermore, Cambodia had been periodically invaded by both Vietnam and Siam. Cambodia lurched uneasily between both poles of domination as dictated by the internal strife of her two larger neighbors. In 1796, Ang Eng, a pro-Siamese king, had died, leaving Ang Chan, who was born in 1791. When Gia Long unified Vietnam, Eng was given investiture by Siam in order to hold out Vietnamese influence, but in 1803, a Cambodian mission paid tribute to Vietnam in attempt to placate Gia Long, something that became an annual routine. In 1807, Ang Chan requested formal investiture as a vassal of Gia Long. Gia Long responded by sending an ambassador bearing the book of investiture, together with a seal of gilded silver. In 1812, Ang Chan refused a request from his brother Ang Snguon to share power, leading to a rebellion. Siam sent troops to support the rebel prince, hoping to enthrone him and wrest influence from Gia Long over Cambodia. In 1813, Gia Long responded by sending a large military contingent that forced the Siamese and Ang Snguon out of Cambodia. As a result, a Vietnamese garrison was permanently installed in the citadel at Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital. Thereafter, Siam made no attempts to regain control of Cambodia during Gia Long&#x27;s rule.

Napoleon&#x27;s aims to conquer Vietnam as a base to threaten Company rule in India never materialized, having been preoccupied by vast military ambitions on mainland Europe. However, France remained the only European power with permanent spokesmen in Vietnam during his reign.

===Trade relations===
Pigneau&#x27;s aborted deal with France allowed Gia Long to keep his country closed to western trade. Gia Long was generally dismissive of European commercial overtures. This was part of a policy of trying to maintain friendly relations with every European power by granting favors to none. In 1804, a British delegation attempted to negotiate trading privileges with Vietnam. It was the only offer of its kind until 1822, such was the extent of European disinterest in Asia during the Napoleonic Wars. Gia Long had purchased arms from British firms in Madras and Calcutta on credit, prompting the British East India Company to send John Roberts to Huế. However, Roberts&#x27;s gifts were turned away and the negotiations for a commercial deal never started. The British then made a request for the exclusive right to trade with Vietnam and the cession of the island of Cham near Faifo, which was rejected, as were further approaches from the Netherlands. Both of these failed attempts were attributed to the influence of the French mandarins. In 1817, the French Prime Minister Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis dispatched the &quot;Cybele&quot;, a frigate with 52 guns to Tourane (now Da Nang) to &quot;show French sympathy and to assure Gia Long of the benevolence of the King of France&quot;. The captain of the vessel was turned away, ostensibly on grounds of protocol for not carrying a royal letter from the French king.

Gia Long kept four French officers in his service after his coronation: Philippe Vannier, Jean-Baptiste Chaigneau, de Forsans and the doctor Despiau. All became high ranking mandarins and were treated well. They were given 50 bodyguards each, ornate residences and were exempt for having to prostrate before the emperor. Recommendations from French officials in Pondicherry to Napoleon Bonaparte suggesting the re-establishment of diplomatic relations with Vietnam were fruitless due to the preoccupation with war in Europe. However, French merchants from Bordeaux were later able to begin trading with Vietnam after the further efforts of the Duc de Richelieu.

===Domestic policies and capital works===

Gia Long abolished all large landholding by princes, nobles, and high officials. He dismantled the 800-year-old practice of paying officials and rewarding or endowing nobles with a portion of the taxes from a village or a group thereof. Existing highways were repaired, and new ones constructed, with the north–south road from Saigon to Lạng Sơn put under restoration. He organized a postal service to operate along the highways and public storehouses were built to alleviate starvation in drought-affected years. Gia Long enacted monetary reform and implemented a more socialized agrarian policy. However, the population growth far outstripped that of land clearing and cultivation. There was little emphasis on innovation in agricultural technology, so the improvements in productivity were mainly derived from increasing the amount of cultivated farmland.

Although the civil war was over, Gia Long decided to add to the two citadels that had been built under the supervision of French officers. Gia Long was convinced of their effectiveness and during his 18-year reign, a further 11 citadels were built throughout the country. The majority were built in the Vauban style, with pentagonal or hexagonal geometry, while a minority, including the one in Huế, were built in a four-sided traditional Chinese design. The fortresses were built at Vinh, Thanh Hóa, Bắc Ninh, Hà Tĩnh, Thái Nguyên and Hải Dương in the north, Huế, Quảng Ngãi, Khánh Hòa and Bình Định in the centre, and Vĩnh Long in the Mekong Delta. Construction was at its most intense in the early phase of Gia Long&#x27;s reign, only one of the 11 was built in the last six years of his rule. De Puymanel and Lebrun left Vietnam before the end of the war, so the forts were designed by Vietnamese engineers who oversaw the construction. The position of Citadel Supervision Officer was created under the Ministry of War and made responsible for the work, underlining the importance that Gia Long placed on fortifications. Gia Long&#x27;s fortifications program was marred by accusations that the people labored all day and part of the night in all weather conditions, and that as a direct consequence, land went fallow. Complaints of mandarin corruption and oppressive taxation were often leveled at his government. Following his coronation, Gia Long drastically reduced his naval fleet, and by the 1810s, only two of the European-style vessels were still in service. The downsizing of the navy was mainly attributed to budgetary constraints caused by heavy spending on fortifications and transport infrastructures such as roads, dykes, and canals. However, in 1819, a new phase of shipbuilding was launched, with Gia Long personally supervising the dockyards.

===Social policy===
In order to train and recruit government officials, Gia Long revived the Confucian court examinations that had been abolished by the Tây Sơn. In 1803, he founded the National Academy (&quot;Quốc Tử Giám&quot;) at Huế. Its objective was to educate the sons of mandarins and meritorious students in Confucian classical literature. In 1804, Gia Long promulgated edicts establishing similar schools in the provinces, as well as guidelines to regulate their staff and curriculum. He appointed Directors of Education (&quot;quan đốc học&quot;) to oversee the provincial education system and the selection process for the entrance examinations to the National Academy, beginning in 1802. The Directors were assisted by Subordinate and Assistant Directors (phó đốc học &quot;or&quot; trợ-giáo). Gia Long explained to his court in 1814 that the goal was to create a cadre of classically educated, politically loyal administrators:


In 1807, Gia Long opened the first civil service examinations held under the Nguyễn dynasty, staged at regional level. From then on, the training and selection process for the imperial bureaucracy was largely centered on examinations. The curriculum for the examinations consisted of the Four Books and Five Classics, which focused on Chinese history leading up to the Song dynasty, while regarding other knowledge as irrelevant.

Gia Long promulgated a new legal code to replace the system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of scholars led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the &quot;Bộ luật Gia Long&quot; (&quot;Gia Long Code&quot;) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system was a mixture of the Le code and Qing dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near-complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and the traditional family unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.
Now that Vietnam was unified, the center of gravity of the country moved further south, following centuries of southerly migration and conquest, so Gia Long moved the seat of government from Hanoi to Huế. Gia Long rebuilt the old citadel of Phú Xuân into a fortress stronghold. The structure was a square shape of 2.5 km per side. A 9 m rampart was encased with masonry and protected by protruding bastions, each defended by 36 guns. The exterior and interior were flanked and reinforced by a series of moats. The citadel&#x27;s defenders included an 800-strong elephant troop. The new palace structure, protocol and court dress were all taken directly from Qing dynasty styles, and his palace and fortress was intended to be a smaller copy of the Chinese Forbidden City in the 1800s.

Gia Long tolerated the Catholic faith of his French allies and permitted unimpeded missionary activities out of respect to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At the time of his death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.

In August 1802, Gia Long retaliated against the captured Tây Sơn leadership who had executed his family in the 1770s. The surviving members of the family and its leading generals and their families were executed. The remains of Quang Trung and his queen were exhumed and desecrated, and his son, the last Tây Sơn monarch Quang Toản was bound to four elephants and torn apart. Gia Long repealed the changes enacted by Quang Trung and reverted to the prior Confucian orthodoxy. This included restoring the civil service to the forefront of decision making, ahead of the army, and reversed Quang Trung&#x27;s education reforms, which put science before the study of Confucian literature.

==Family and succession==

Gia Long had many wives, but the most famous consorts are Empress Thừa Thiên, Empress Thuận Thiên, and Consort Lê Ngọc Bình.
In 1780, during the war against the Tây Sơn, he married Tống Thị Lan, the daughter of a Nguyen general. They had two sons, the first being Nguyễn Phúc Chiêu, who died shortly after birth in Phú Quốc island, and later Crown Prince Nguyễn Phúc Cảnh. Following Gia Long&#x27;s ascension to the throne, she became Empress consort and was given the title of Empress Thừa Thiên posthumously. Around 1781, during the war with the Tây Sơn, he married his second wife Trần Thị Đang, a daughter of one of his ministers. They had three sons, Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, Nguyen Phuc Dai and Nguyen Phuc Chan, and was posthumously given the title of Empress Thuận Thiên. After his conquest of Vietnam, Gia Long, took his third wife, Lê Ngọc Bình. A daughter of Lê Hiển Tông, the penultimate emperor of the Lê dynasty, she was betrothed by Emperor Quang Trung to his son Quang Toản. After Gia Long defeated the Tây Sơn and executed Quang Toan, he took her as his wife. Gia Long had almost 100 concubines who were daughters of his mandarins; Gia Long did not favor polygamy but he did so to secure the loyalty of his inner circle.

As Crown Prince Nguyen Canh had died of smallpox during the war against the Tây Sơn, it was assumed that Canh&#x27;s son would succeed Gia Long as emperor, but in 1816 Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, the son of his second wife, was appointed instead, and ruled as Minh Mạng. Gia Long chose him for his strong character and his deep aversion to westerners, whereas Canh&#x27;s lineage had converted to Catholicism and were reluctant to maintain their Confucian traditions such as ancestor worship. Before his accession, Nguyễn Phúc Đảm was reported to have praised the Japanese for having expelled and eradicated Christianity from their country. Gia Long told his son to treat the Europeans respectfully, especially the French, but not to grant them any position of preponderance. Gia Long died on 3 February 1820 and was buried at the Thien Tho Tomb and posthumously named Thế Tổ Cao Hoàng đế.

<doc id="1101841" wikidata="Q1062158" url="?curid=1101841" title="Refractometry">
<text>Refractometry is the analytical method of measuring substances&#x27; refractive index (one of their fundamental physical properties) in order to, for instance, assess their composition or purity. A refractometer is the instrument used to measure refractive index (&quot;RI&quot;). Although refractometers are best known for measuring liquids, they are also used to measure gases and solids, such as glass and gemstones.

The RI of a substance is strongly influenced by temperature and the wavelength of light used to measure it; therefore, care must be taken to control or compensate for temperature differences and wavelength. RI measurements are usually reported at a reference temperature of 20 degrees Celsius, which is equal to 68 degrees Fahrenheit and is considered to be room temperature. A reference wavelength of 589.3 nm (the sodium D line) is most often used. Though RI is a dimensionless quantity, it is typically reported as nD20 (or n), where the &quot;n&quot; represents refractive index, the &quot;D&quot; denotes the wavelength, and the 20 denotes the reference temperature. Therefore, the refractive index of water at 20 degrees Celsius, taken at the Sodium D Line, would be reported as 1.3330 nD20.

Refractometers are frequently used by grape growers and kiwifruit growers for Brix testing of sucrose levels in their fruit. Refractometry is also used in the gelatin industry. To convert the RI of a gelatin sol (reported in Brix) to a gelatin concentration, one need only multiply by eight-tenths (0.8). A sol with a 10.0 RI would therefore be 8% gelatin by weight. This is known to be a reliable conversion for gelatin sols as low as 1% up to over 50%.

==Types of refractometers==

There are four main types of fluid refractometers: traditional handheld refractometers, digital handheld refractometers, Abbe refractometers, and inline process refractometers.

<text>Laser radiation safety is the safe design, use and implementation of lasers to minimize the risk of laser accidents, especially those involving eye injuries. Since even relatively small amounts of laser light can lead to permanent eye injuries, the sale and usage of lasers is typically subject to government regulations.

Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the retina, or even the skin. To control the risk of injury, various specifications, for example 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 1040 in the US and IEC 60825 internationally, define &quot;classes&quot; of laser depending on their power and wavelength. These regulations impose upon manufacturers required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles when operating lasers. Consensus standards, such as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Z136, provide users with control measures for laser hazards, as well as various tables helpful in calculating maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limits and accessible exposures limits (AELs).

Thermal effects are the predominant cause of laser radiation injury, but photo-chemical effects can also be of concern for specific wavelengths of laser radiation. Even moderately powered lasers can cause injury to the eye. High power lasers can also burn the skin. Some lasers are so powerful that even the diffuse reflection from a surface can be hazardous to the eye.

The coherence and low divergence angle of laser light, aided by focusing from the lens of an eye, can cause laser radiation to be concentrated into an extremely small spot on the retina. A transient increase of only +10°C (+18°F) can destroy retinal photoreceptor cells. If the laser is sufficiently powerful, permanent damage can occur within a fraction of a second, which is faster than the blink of an eye. Sufficiently powerful lasers in the visible to near infrared range (400-1400 nm) will penetrate the eyeball and may cause heating of the retina, whereas exposure to laser radiation with wavelengths less than 400 nm or greater than 1400 nm are largely absorbed by the cornea and lens, leading to the development of cataracts or burn injuries.

Infrared lasers are particularly hazardous, since the body&#x27;s protective glare aversion response, also referred to as the &quot;blink reflex,&quot; is triggered only by visible light. For example, some people exposed to high power s emitting invisible 1064 nm radiation may not feel pain or notice immediate damage to their eyesight. A pop or click noise emanating from the eyeball may be the only indication that retinal damage has occurred, i.e. the retina was heated to over resulting in localized explosive boiling accompanied by the immediate creation of a permanent blind spot.

== Damage mechanisms ==
Lasers can cause damage in biological tissues, both to the eye and to the skin, due to several mechanisms. Thermal damage, or burn, occurs when tissues are heated to the point where denaturation of proteins occurs. Another mechanism is photochemical damage, where light triggers chemical reactions in tissue. Photochemical damage occurs mostly with short-wavelength (blue and ultraviolet) light and can be accumulated over the course of hours. Laser pulses shorter than about 1 μs can cause a rapid rise in temperature, resulting in explosive boiling of water. The shock wave from the explosion can subsequently cause damage relatively far away from the point of impact. Ultrashort pulses can also exhibit self-focusing in the transparent parts of the eye, leading to an increase of the damage potential compared to longer pulses with the same energy. Photoionization proved to be the main mechanism of radiation damage at the use of titanium-sapphire laser.

The eye focuses visible and near-infrared light onto the retina. A laser beam can be focused to an intensity on the retina which may be up to 200,000 times higher than at the point where the laser beam enters the eye. Most of the light is absorbed by melanin pigments in the pigment epithelium just behind the photoreceptors, and causes burns in the retina. Ultraviolet light with wavelengths shorter than 400 nm tends to be absorbed by lens and 300 nm in the cornea, where it can produce injuries at relatively low powers due to photochemical damage. Infrared light mainly causes thermal damage to the retina at near-infrared wavelengths and to more frontal parts of the eye at longer wavelengths. The table below summarizes the various medical conditions caused by lasers at different wavelengths, not including injuries due to pulsed lasers.

The skin is usually much less sensitive to laser light than the eye, but excessive exposure to ultraviolet light from any source (laser or non-laser) can cause short- and long-term effects similar to sunburn, while visible and infrared wavelengths are mainly harmful due to thermal damage.

== Lasers and aviation safety ==
FAA researchers compiled a database of more than 400 reported incidents occurring between 1990 and 2004 in which pilots have been startled, distracted, temporarily blinded, or disoriented by laser exposure. This information led to an inquiry in the US Congress. Exposure to hand-held laser light under such circumstances may seem trivial given the brevity of exposure, the large distances involved and beam spread of up to several metres. However, laser exposure may create dangerous conditions such as flash blindness. If this occurs during a critical moment in aircraft operation, the aircraft may be endangered. In addition, some 18% to 35% of the population possess the autosomal dominant genetic trait, photic sneeze, that causes the affected individual to experience an involuntary sneezing fit when exposed to a sudden flash of light.

== Maximum permissible exposure ==


The &quot;maximum permissible exposure&quot; (MPE) is the highest power or energy density (in W/cm2 or J/cm2) of a light source that is considered safe, i.e. that has a negligible probability for creating damage. It is usually about 10% of the dose that has a 50% chance of creating damage
under worst-case conditions. The MPE is measured at the cornea of the human eye or at the skin, for a given wavelength and exposure time.

A calculation of the MPE for ocular exposure takes into account the various ways light can act upon the eye. For example, deep-ultraviolet light causes accumulating damage, even at very low powers. Infrared light with a wavelength longer than about 1400 nm is absorbed by the transparent parts of the eye before it reaches the retina, which means that the MPE for these wavelengths is higher than for visible light. In addition to the wavelength and exposure time, the MPE takes into account the spatial distribution of the light (from a laser or otherwise). Collimated laser beams of visible and near-infrared light are especially dangerous at relatively low powers because the lens focuses the light onto a tiny spot on the retina. Light sources with a smaller degree of spatial coherence than a well-collimated laser beam, such as high-power LEDs, lead to a distribution of the light over a larger area on the retina. For such sources, the MPE is higher than for collimated laser beams. In the MPE calculation, the worst-case scenario is assumed, in which the eye lens focuses the light into the smallest possible spot size on the retina for the particular wavelength and the pupil is fully open. Although the MPE is specified as power or energy per unit surface, it is based on the power or energy that can pass through a fully open pupil (0.39 cm2) for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This is relevant for laser beams that have a cross-section smaller than 0.39 cm2. The IEC-60825-1 and ANSI Z136.1 standards include methods of calculating MPEs.

== Regulations ==
In various jurisdictions, standards bodies, legislation, and government regulations define classes of laser according to the risks associated with them, and define required safety measures for people who may be exposed to those lasers.

In the European Community (EC), eye protection requirements are specified in European standard EN 207 and the maximal laser light intensities in EN 60825. In addition, European standard EN 208 specifies requirements for goggles for use during beam alignment. These transmit a portion of the laser light, permitting the operator to see where the beam is, and do not provide complete protection against a direct laser beam hit.

In the US, guidance for the use of protective eyewear, and other elements of safe laser use, is given in the ANSI Z136 series of standards. These consensus standards are intended for laser users, and full copies can be purchased directly from ANSI or the official Secretariat to the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) Z136 and Publisher of this series of ANSI standards, the Laser Institute of America. The standards are as follows:
* ANSI Z136.1 – &quot;Safe Use of Lasers&quot;

:Intended to protect individuals with the potential for laser exposure when lasers are used in manufacturing environments, this standard includes policies and procedures to ensure laser safety in both public and private industries as well as product development along with testing.

Through 21 CFR 1040, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates laser products entering commerce and requires all class IIIb and class IV lasers offered in commerce in the US to have five standard safety features: a key switch, a safety interlock dongle, a power indicator, an aperture shutter, and an emission delay (normally two to three seconds). OEM lasers, designed to be parts of other components (such as DVD burners), are exempt from this requirement. Some non-portable lasers may not have a safety dongle or an emission delay, but have an emergency stop button and/or a remote switch.

== Classification ==
Lasers have been classified by wavelength and power into four classes and a few subclasses since the early 1970s. The classifications categorize lasers according to their ability to produce damage in exposed people, from class 1 (no hazard during normal use) to class 4 (severe hazard for eyes and skin). There are two classification systems, the &quot;old system&quot; used before 2002, and the &quot;revised system&quot; being phased in since 2002. The latter reflects the greater knowledge of lasers that has been accumulated since the original classification system was devised, and permits certain types of lasers to be recognized as having a lower hazard than was implied by their placement in the original classification system. The revised system is part of the revised IEC 60825 standard. From 2007, the revised system is also incorporated into the US-oriented ANSI Laser Safety Standard (ANSI Z136.1). Since 2007, labeling according to the revised system is accepted by the FDA on laser products imported into the US. The old and revised systems can be distinguished by the 1M, 2M and 3R classes used only in the revised system and the 2A and 3A classes used only in the old system. Class numbers were designated using Roman numerals (I–IV) in the US under the old system and Arabic numerals (1–4) in the EU. The revised system uses Arabic numerals (1–4) in all jurisdictions.

The classification of a laser is based on the concept of &quot;accessible emission limits&quot; (AEL) that are defined for each laser class. This is usually a maximum power (in W) or energy (in J) that can be emitted in a specified wavelength range and exposure time that passes through a specified aperture stop at a specified distance. For infrared wavelengths above 4 μm, it is specified as a maximum power density (in W/m2). It is the responsibility of the manufacturer to provide the correct classification of a laser, and to equip the laser with appropriate warning labels and safety measures as prescribed by the regulations. Safety measures used with the more powerful lasers include key-controlled operation, warning lights to indicate laser light emission, a beam stop or attenuator, and an electrical contact that the user can connect to an emergency stop or interlock.

=== IEC 60825-1 ===
Below, the main characteristics and requirements for the classification system as specified by the IEC 60825-1 standard are listed, along with typical required warning labels. Additionally, classes 2 and higher must have the triangular warning label shown here, and other labels are required in specific cases indicating laser emission, laser apertures, skin hazards, and invisible wavelengths. For classes I to IV, see the section old system further below.
==== Class 1 ====
A Class 1 laser is safe under all conditions of normal use. This means the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) cannot be exceeded when viewing a laser with the naked eye or with the aid of typical magnifying optics (e.g. telescope or microscope). To verify compliance, the standard specifies the aperture and distance corresponding to the naked eye, a typical telescope viewing a collimated beam, and a typical microscope viewing a divergent beam. Certain lasers classified as Class 1 may still pose a hazard when viewed with a telescope or microscope of sufficiently large aperture. For example, a high-power laser with a very large collimated beam or very highly divergent beam may be classified as Class 1 if the power that passes through the apertures defined in the standard is less than the AEL for Class 1; however, an unsafe power level may be collected by a magnifying optic with larger aperture. Often, devices such as optical drives will be considered class 1 if they fully contain the beam of a more powerful, higher-class laser, such that no light escapes under normal use.
==== Class 1M ====
A Class 1M laser is safe for all conditions of use except when passed through magnifying optics such as microscopes and telescopes. Class 1M lasers produce large-diameter beams, or beams that are divergent. The MPE for a Class 1M laser cannot normally be exceeded unless focusing or imaging optics are used to narrow the beam. If the beam is refocused, the hazard of Class 1M lasers may be increased and the product class may be changed. A laser can be classified as Class 1M if the power that can pass through the pupil of the naked eye is less than the AEL for Class 1, but the power that can be collected into the eye by typical magnifying optics (as defined in the standard) is higher than the AEL for Class 1 and lower than the AEL for Class 3B.

==== Class 2 ====
A Class 2 laser is considered to be safe because the blink reflex (glare aversion response to bright lights) will limit the exposure to no more than 0.25 seconds. It only applies to visible-light lasers (400–700 nm). Class 2 lasers are limited to 1 mW continuous wave, or more if the emission time is less than 0.25 seconds or if the light is not spatially coherent. Intentional suppression of the blink reflex could lead to eye injury. Some laser pointers and measuring instruments are class 2.

==== Class 2M ====
A Class 2M laser is safe because of the blink reflex if not viewed through optical instruments. As with class 1M, this applies to laser beams with a large diameter or large divergence, for which the amount of light passing through the pupil cannot exceed the limits for class 2.
==== Class 3R ====
A Class 3R laser is considered safe if handled carefully, with restricted beam viewing. With a class 3R laser, the MPE can be exceeded, but with a low risk of injury. Visible continuous lasers in Class 3R are limited to 5 mW. For other wavelengths and for pulsed lasers, other limits apply.
==== Class 3B ====
A Class 3B laser is hazardous if the eye is exposed directly, but diffuse reflections such as those from paper or other matte surfaces are not harmful. The AEL for continuous lasers in the wavelength range from 315 nm to far infrared is 0.5 W. For pulsed lasers between 400 and 700 nm, the limit is 30 mJ. Other limits apply to other wavelengths and to ultrashort pulsed lasers. Protective eyewear is typically required where direct viewing of a class 3B laser beam may occur. Class-3B lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Class 3B lasers are used inside CD and DVD writers, although the writer unit itself is class 1 because the laser light cannot leave the unit.
==== Class 4 ====
Class 4 is the highest and most dangerous class of laser, including all lasers that exceed the Class 3B AEL. By definition, a class 4 laser can burn the skin, or cause devastating and permanent eye damage as a result of direct, diffuse or indirect beam viewing. These lasers may ignite combustible materials, and thus may represent a fire risk. These hazards may also apply to indirect or non-specular reflections of the beam, even from apparently matte surfaces meaning that great care must be taken to control the beam path. Class 4 lasers must be equipped with a key switch and a safety interlock. Most industrial, scientific, military, and medical lasers are in this category. Medical lasers can have divergent emissions and require awareness of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and nominal ocular hazard area (NOHA).

=== Old system ===
The safety classes in the &quot;old system&quot; of classification were established in the United States through consensus standards (ANSI Z136.1) and federal and state regulations. The international classification described in consensus standards such as IEC 825 (later IEC 60825) was based on the same concepts, but presented with designations slightly different from the US classification.

This classification system is only slightly altered from the original system developed in the early 1970s. It is still used by US laser product safety regulations. The laser powers mentioned are typical values. Classification is also dependent on the wavelength and on whether the laser is pulsed or continuous. For laser classes 1 to 4, see the section on the revised system above.

==== Class I ====
Inherently safe; no possibility of eye damage. This can be either because of a low output power (in which case eye damage is impossible even after hours of exposure), or due to an enclosure preventing user access to the laser beam during normal operation, such as in CD players or laser printers.

==== Class II ====
The blink reflex of the human eye (aversion response) will prevent eye damage, unless the person deliberately stares into the beam for an extended period. Output power may be up to 1 mW. This class includes only lasers that emit visible light. Some laser pointers are in this category.

==== Class IIa ====
A region in the low-power end of Class II where the laser requires in excess of 1000 seconds of continuous viewing to produce a burn to the retina. Commercial laser scanners are in this subclass.

==== Class IIIa ====
Lasers in this class are mostly dangerous in combination with optical instruments which change the beam diameter or power density, though even without optical instrument enhancement, direct contact with the eye for over two minutes may cause serious damage to the retina. Output power does not exceed 5 mW. Beam power density may not exceed 2.5 mW/cm if the device is not labeled with a &quot;caution&quot; warning label, otherwise a &quot;danger&quot; warning label is required. Many laser sights for firearms and laser pointers commonly used for presentations are in this category.

==== Class IIIb ====
Lasers in this class may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This generally applies to lasers powered from 5–500 mW. Lasers in this category can cause permanent eye damage with exposures of 1/100 of a second or more, depending on the strength of the laser. A diffuse reflection is generally not hazardous, but specular reflections can be just as dangerous as direct exposures. Protective eyewear is recommended when direct beam viewing of Class IIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.

==== Class IV ====
Lasers in this class have output powers of more than 500 mW in the beam and may cause severe, permanent damage to eye or skin without being focussed by optics of eye or instrumentation. Diffuse reflections of the laser beam can be hazardous to skin or eye within the &quot;nominal hazard zone&quot;. (The &quot;nominal hazard zone&quot; is the area around a laser in which the applicable MPE is exceeded.) Many industrial, scientific, military and medical lasers are in this category.

== Safety measures ==

=== General precautions ===
Many scientists involved with lasers agree on the following guidelines:
* Everyone who uses a laser should be aware of the risks. This awareness is not just a matter of time spent with lasers; to the contrary, long-term dealing with invisible risks (such as from infrared laser beams) tends to reduce risk awareness, rather than to sharpen it, primarily due to complacency.
* Optical experiments should be carried out on an optical table with all laser beams travelling in the horizontal plane only, and all beams should be stopped at the edges of the table. Users should never put their eyes at the level of the horizontal plane where the beams are, in case of reflected beams that leave the table.
* Watches, and other jewelry that might enter the optical plane, should not be allowed in the laboratory. All non-optical objects that are close to the optical plane should have a matte finish in order to prevent specular reflections.
* Adequate eye protection should always be required for everyone in the room if there is a significant risk for eye injury.
* High-intensity beams that can cause fire or skin damage (mainly from class 4 and ultraviolet lasers) and that are not frequently modified should be guided through opaque tubes.
* Alignment of beams and optical components should be performed at a reduced beam power whenever possible.

=== Protective eyewear ===
The use of eye protection when operating lasers of classes 3B and 4 in a manner that may result in eye exposure above the MPE is required in the workplace by the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Protective eyewear in the form of appropriately filtering optics can protect the eyes from the reflected or scattered laser light with a hazardous beam power, as well as from direct exposure to a laser beam. Eyewear must be selected for the specific type of laser, to block or attenuate in the appropriate wavelength range. For example, eyewear absorbing 532 nm typically has an orange appearance (although one should never rely solely on the lens color when selecting laser eye protection), transmitting wavelengths larger than 550 nm. Such eyewear would be useless as protection against a laser emitting at 800 nm. Furthermore, some lasers emit more than one wavelength of light, and this may be a particular problem with some less expensive frequency-doubled lasers, such as 532 nm &quot;green laser pointers&quot; which are commonly pumped by 808 nm infrared laser diodes, and also generate the fundamental 1064 nm laser beam which is used to produce the final 532 nm output. If the IR radiation is allowed into the beam, which happens in some green laser pointers, it will in general not be blocked by regular red or orange-colored protective eyewear designed for pure green or already IR-filtered beam. Special YAG laser and dual-frequency eyewear are available for work with frequency-doubled YAG and other IR lasers which have a visible beam, but it is more expensive, and IR-pumped green laser products do not always specify whether such extra protection is needed.

Eyewear is rated for optical density (OD), which is the base-10 logarithm of the attenuation factor by which the optical filter reduces beam power. For example, eyewear with OD 3 will reduce the beam power in the specified wavelength range by a factor of 1000. In addition to an optical density sufficient to reduce beam power to below the maximum permissible exposure (see above), laser eyewear used where direct beam exposure is possible should be able to withstand a direct hit from the laser beam without breaking. The protective specifications (wavelengths and optical densities) are usually printed on the goggles, generally near the top of the unit. In the European Community, manufacturers are required by European standard EN 207 to specify the maximum power rating rather than the optical density. Always wear safety goggles.

=== Interlocks and automatic shutdown ===
Interlocks are circuits that stop the laser beam if some condition is not met, such as if the laser casing or a room door is open. Class 3B and 4 lasers typically provide a connection for an external interlock circuit. Many lasers are considered class 1 only because the light is contained within an interlocked enclosure, like DVD drives or portable CD players.

Some systems have electronics that automatically shut down the laser under other conditions. For example, some fiber-optic communication systems have circuits that automatically shut down transmission if a fiber is disconnected or broken.

=== Laser-safety officer ===
In many jurisdictions, organizations that operate lasers are required to appoint a laser-safety officer (LSO). The LSO is responsible for ensuring that safety regulations are followed by all other workers in the organization.

== Laser pointers ==

In the period from 1999 to 2016, increasing attention has been paid to the risks posed by so-called laser pointers and laser pens. Typically, the sale of laser pointers is restricted to either class 3A (&lt;5 mW) or class 2 (&lt;1 mW), depending on local regulations. For example, in the US, Canada and the UK, class 3A is the maximum permitted, unless a key actuated control or other safety features are provided. In Australia, class 2 is the maximum allowed class. However, because enforcement is often not very strict, laser pointers of class 2 and above are often available for sale even in countries where they are not allowed.

Van Norren et al. (1998) could not find a single example in the medical literature of a &lt;1 mW class III laser causing eyesight damage. Mainster et al. (2003) provide one case, an 11-year-old child who temporarily damaged her eyesight by holding an approximately 5 mW red laser pointer close to the eye and staring into the beam for 10 seconds; she experienced scotoma (a blind spot) but fully recovered after three months. Luttrull &amp; Hallisey (1999) describe a similar case, a 34-year-old male who stared into the beam of a class IIIa 5 mW red laser for 30 to 60 seconds, causing temporary central scotoma and visual field loss. His eyesight fully recovered within two days, at the time of his eye exam. An intravenous fundus fluorescein angiogram, a technique used by ophthalmologists to visualise the retina of the eye in fine detail, identified subtle discoloration of the fovea.

Thus, it appears that a brief 0.25-second exposure to a &lt;5 mW laser such as found in red laser pointers does not pose a threat to eye health. On the other hand, there is a potential for injury if a person deliberately stares into a beam of a class IIIa laser a for few seconds or more at close range. Even if injury occurs, most people will fully recover their vision. Further experienced discomforts than these may be psychological rather than physical. With regard to green laser pointers the safe exposure time may be less, and with even higher powered lasers instant permanent damage should be expected. These conclusions must be qualified with recent theoretical observations that certain prescription medications may interact with some wavelengths of laser light, causing increased sensitivity (phototoxicity).

Beyond the question of physical injury to the eye from a laser pointer, several other undesirable effects are possible. These include short-lived flash blindness if the beam is encountered in darkened surroundings, as when driving at night. This may result in momentary loss of vehicular control. Lasers pointed at aircraft are a hazard to aviation. A police officer seeing a red dot on his chest may conclude that a sniper is targeting him and take aggressive action. In addition, the startle reflex exhibited by some exposed unexpectedly to laser light of this sort has been reported to have resulted in cases of self-injury or loss of control. For these and similar reasons, the US Food and Drug Administration has advised that laser pointers are not toys and should not be used by minors except under the direct supervision of an adult.

== Fibre optics for communications ==
Fibre optic laser safety is characterised by the fact that in normal operation the light beam is inaccessible, so something has to be unplugged or broken for it to become accessible. The resultant exit beam is quite divergent, so eye safety is highly dependent on distance, and if a magnifying device is used.

In practice, accidental exposure to the large majority of installed systems is unlikely to have any health impact, since power levels are usually below 1 mW and the wavelength in the infra-red, e.g. Class 1. However, there are a few significant exceptions.

Most single mode/multi mode fiber systems actually use infra-red light, invisible to the human eye. In this case, there is no eye aversion response. A special case is systems operating at 670–1000 nm, where the beam may appear to be a dull red, even if the light beam is actually very intense. Technicians may also use red lasers for fault finding at around 628–670 nm. These can create a significant hazard if viewed incorrectly, particularly if they are abnormally high power. Such visible fault finders are usually classified as Class 2 up to 1 mW, and Class 2M up to 10 mW.

High power optical amplifiers are used in long distance systems. They use internal pump lasers with power levels up to a few watts, which is a major hazard. However, these power levels are contained within the amplifier module. Any system employing typical optical connectors (i.e. not expanded beam) cannot typically exceed about 100 mW, above which power level single mode connectors become unreliable, so if there is a single mode connector in the system, the design power level will always be below this level, even if no other details are known . An additional factor with these systems is that light around the 1550 nm wavelength band (common for optical amplifiers) is regarded as relatively low risk, since the eye fluids absorb the light before it is focused on the retina. This tends to reduce the overall risk factor of such systems.

Optical microscopes and magnifying devices also present unique safety challenges. If any optical power is present, and a simple magnifying device is used to examine the fiber end, then the user is no longer protected by beam divergence, since the entire beam may be imaged onto the eye. Therefore, simple magnifying devices should never be used in such situations. Optical connector inspection microscopes are available which incorporate blocking filters, thus greatly improving eye safety. The most recent such design also incorporates protection against red fault locating lasers.

== Non-beam hazards – electrical and other ==
While most of the danger of lasers comes from the beam itself, there are certain non-beam hazards that are often associated with use of laser systems. Many lasers are high voltage devices, typically 400 V upward for a small 5 mJ pulsed laser, and exceeding many kilovolts in higher powered lasers. This, coupled with high pressure water for cooling the laser and other associated electrical equipment, can create a greater hazard than the laser beam itself.

Electric equipment should generally be installed at least 250 mm (10 inches) above the floor to reduce electric risk in the case of flooding. Optical tables, lasers, and other equipment should be well grounded. Enclosure interlocks should be respected and special precautions taken during troubleshooting.

In addition to the electrical hazards, lasers may create chemical, mechanical, and other hazards specific to particular installations. Chemical hazards may include materials intrinsic to the laser, such as beryllium oxide in argon ion laser tubes, halogens in excimer lasers, organic dyes dissolved in toxic or flammable solvents in dye lasers, and heavy metal vapors and asbestos insulation in helium cadmium lasers. They may also include materials released during laser processing, such as metal fumes from cutting or surface treatments of metals or the complex mix of decomposition products produced in the high energy plasma of a laser cutting plastics.

Mechanical hazards may include moving parts in vacuum and pressure pumps; implosion or explosion of flashlamps, plasma tubes, water jackets, and gas handling equipment.

High temperatures and fire hazards may also result from the operation of high-powered Class IIIB or any Class IV Laser.

In commercial laser systems, hazard mitigations such as the presence of fusible plugs, thermal interrupters, and pressure relief valves reduce the hazard of, for example, a steam explosion arising from an obstructed water cooling jacket. Interlocks, shutters, and warning lights are often critical elements of modern commercial installations. In older lasers, experimental and hobby systems, and those removed from other equipment (OEM units) special care must be taken to anticipate and reduce the consequences of misuse as well as various failure modes.

<doc id="1101849" wikidata="Q1147647" url="?curid=1101849" title="Cyclic voltammetry">
<text>In electrochemistry, cyclic voltammetry (CV) is a type of voltammetric measurement where the potential of the working electrode is ramped linearly versus time. Unlike in linear sweep voltammetry, after the set potential is reached in a CV experiment, the working electrode&#x27;s potential is ramped in the opposite direction to return to the initial potential. These cycles in potential are repeated until the voltammetric trace reaches a cyclic steady state. The current at the working electrode is plotted versus the voltage at the working electrode to yield the cyclic voltammogram (see Figure 1). Cyclic voltammetry is generally used to study the electrochemical properties of an analyte in solution or of a molecule that is adsorbed onto the electrode.

== Experimental method ==
In cyclic voltammetry (CV), the electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time in cyclical phases. The rate of voltage change over time during each of these phases is known as the scan rate (V/s). In a standard three-electrode cell, the potential is measured between the working electrode and the reference electrode, while the current is measured between the working electrode and the counter electrode. These data are plotted as current density (&quot;j&quot;, mA/cm2) versus potential (typically corrected for Ohmic/iR drop) (&quot;E&quot;, V). During the initial forward scan from t0 to t1, an increasingly oxidative (positive) potential is applied, and the anodic (positive) current increases over this time period due to the charging of the electric double layer. The spike in anodic (positive) current observed between t0 and t1 is due to the oxidation of the analyte in the solution when the correct potential is reached. The current decreases after the initial spike as the concentration of oxidable analyte is depleted near the surface of the working electrode due to mass transport limitations. If the redox couple is reversible, then during the reverse scan (from t1 to t2), the oxidized analyte will start to be re-reduced, giving rise to a cathodic current of opposite polarity. The more reversible the redox couple is, the more similar the oxidation peak will be in shape to the reduction peak. Hence, CV data can provide information about redox potentials and electrochemical reaction rates.

For instance, if the electron transfer at the working electrode surface is fast and the current is limited by the diffusion of analyte species to the electrode surface, then the peak current will be proportional to the square root of the scan rate. This relationship is described by the Randles–Sevcik equation. In this situation, the CV experiment only samples a small portion of the solution, i.e., the diffusion layer at the electrode surface.

== Characterization ==
The utility of cyclic voltammetry is highly dependent on the analyte being studied. The analyte has to be redox active within the potential window to be scanned.

===The analyte is in solution===
====Reversible couples====

Often the analyte displays a reversible CV wave (such as that depicted in Figure 1), which is observed when all of the initial analyte can be recovered after a forward and reverse scan cycle. Although such reversible couples are simpler to analyze, they contain less information than more complex waveforms.

The waveform of even reversible couples is complex owing to the combined effects of polarization and diffusion. The difference between the two peak potentials (Ep), ΔEp, is of particular interest.
: Δ&quot;E&quot;p = &quot;E&quot;pa - &quot;E&quot;pc &gt; 0

This difference mainly results from the effects of analyte diffusion rates. In the ideal case of a reversible 1e- couple (i.e., Nernstian), Δ&quot;E&quot;p is 57 mV and the full-width half-max of the forward scan peak is 59 mV. Typical values observed experimentally are greater, often approaching 70 or 80 mV. The waveform is also affected by the rate of electron transfer, usually discussed as the activation barrier for electron transfer. A theoretical description of polarization overpotential is in part described by the Butler–Volmer equation and Cottrell equation. In an ideal system the relationship reduces to formula_1 for an &quot;n&quot; electron process.

Focusing on current, reversible couples are characterized by &quot;i&quot;pa/&quot;i&quot;pc = 1.

When a reversible peak is observed, thermodynamic information in the form of a half cell potential E01/2 can be determined. When waves are semi-reversible (&quot;i&quot;pa/&quot;i&quot;pc is close but not equal to 1), it may be possible to determine even more specific information (see electrochemical reaction mechanism).

The current maxima for oxidation and reduction itself depend on the scan rate, see the figure. 


To study the nature of the electrochemical reaction mechanism it is useful to perform a power fit according to 

:formula_2

A fit with formula_3 in the figure shows the proportionality of the peak currents to the square root of the scan rate when additionally formula_4 is fulfilled. 

This leads to the so called Randles–Sevcik equation and the rate determining step of this electrochemical redox reaction can be assigned to diffusion.

====Nonreversible couples====
Many redox processes observed by CV are quasi-reversible or non-reversible. In such cases the thermodynamic potential E01/2 is often deduced by simulation. The irreversibility is indicated by ipa/ipc ≠ 1. Deviations from unity are attributable to a subsequent chemical reaction that is triggered by the electron transfer. Such EC processes can be complex, involving isomerization, dissociation, association, etc.

=== The analyte is adsorbed onto the electrode surface ===
Adsorbed species give simple voltammetric responses: ideally, at slow scan rates, there is no peak separation, the peak width is 90mV for a one-electron redox couple, and the peak current and peak area are proportional to scan rate (observing that the peak current is proportional to scan rate proves that the redox species that gives the peak is actually immobilised). The effect of increasing the scan rate can be used to measure the rate of interfacial electron transfer and/or the rates of reactions that are coupltransfer. This technique has been useful to study redox proteins, some of which readily adsorb on various electrode materials, but the theory for biological and non-biological redox molecules is the same (see the page about protein film voltammetry).

== Experimental setup ==
CV experiments are conducted on a solution in a cell fitted with electrodes. The solution consists of the solvent, in which is dissolved electrolyte and the species to be studied.

===The cell===
A standard CV experiment employs a cell fitted with three electrodes: reference electrode, working electrode, and counter electrode. This combination is sometimes referred to as a three-electrode setup. Electrolyte is usually added to the sample solution to ensure sufficient conductivity. The solvent, electrolyte, and material composition of the working electrode will determine the potential range that can be accessed during the experiment.

The electrodes are immobile and sit in unstirred solutions during cyclic voltammetry. This &quot;still&quot; solution method gives rise to cyclic voltammetry&#x27;s characteristic diffusion-controlled peaks. This method also allows a portion of the analyte to remain after reduction or oxidation so that it may display further redox activity. Stirring the solution between cyclic voltammetry traces is important in order to supply the electrode surface with fresh analyte for each new experiment. The solubility of an analyte can change drastically with its overall charge; as such it is common for reduced or oxidized analyte species to precipitate out onto the electrode. This layering of analyte can insulate the electrode surface, display its own redox activity in subsequent scans, or otherwise alter the electrode surface in a way that affects the CV measurements. For this reason it is often necessary to clean the electrodes between scans.

Common materials for the working electrode include glassy carbon, platinum, and gold. These electrodes are generally encased in a rod of inert insulator with a disk exposed at one end. A regular working electrode has a radius within an order of magnitude of 1 mm. Having a controlled surface area with a well-defined shape is necessary for being able to interpret cyclic voltammetry results.

To run cyclic voltammetry experiments at very high scan rates a regular working electrode is insufficient. High scan rates create peaks with large currents and increased resistances, which result in distortions. Ultramicroelectrodes can be used to minimize the current and resistance.

The counter electrode, also known as the auxiliary or second electrode, can be any material that conducts current easily, will not react with the bulk solution, and has a surface area much larger than the working electrode. Common choices are platinum and graphite. Reactions occurring at the counter electrode surface are unimportant as long as it continues to conduct current well. To maintain the observed current the counter electrode will often oxidize or reduce the solvent or bulk electrolyte.

===Solvents===
CV can be conducted using a variety of solutions. Solvent choice for cyclic voltammetry takes into account several requirements. The solvent must dissolve the analyte and high concentrations of the supporting electrolyte. It must also be stable in the potential window of the experiment with respect to the working electrode. It must not react with either the analyte or the supporting electrolyte. It must be pure to prevent interference.

===Electrolyte===
The electrolyte ensures good electrical conductivity and minimizes &quot;iR&quot; drop such that the recorded potentials correspond to actual potentials. For aqueous solutions, many electrolytes are available, but typical ones are alkali metal salts of perchlorate and nitrate. In nonaqueous solvents, the range of electrolytes is more limited, and a popular choice is tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate.

== Related potentiometric techniques ==
Potentiodynamic techniques also exist that add low-amplitude AC perturbations to a potential ramp and measure variable response in a single frequency (AC voltammetry) or in many frequencies simultaneously (potentiodynamic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy). The response in alternating current is two-dimensional, characterized by both amplitude and phase. These data can be analyzed to determine information about different chemical processes (charge transfer, diffusion, double layer charging, etc.). Frequency response analysis enables simultaneous monitoring of the various processes that contribute to the potentiodynamic AC response of an electrochemical system.

Whereas cyclic voltammetry is not hydrodynamic voltammetry, useful electrochemical methods are. In such cases, flow is achieved at the electrode surface by stirring the solution, pumping the solution, or rotating the electrode as is the case with rotating disk electrodes and rotating ring-disk electrodes. Such techniques target steady state conditions and produce waveforms that appear the same when scanned in either the positive or negative directions, thus limiting them to linear sweep voltammetry.

== Applications ==
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) has become an important and widely used electroanalytical technique in many areas of chemistry. It is often used to study a variety of redox processes, to determine the stability of reaction products, the presence of intermediates in redox reactions, electron transfer kinetics, and the reversibility of a reaction. It can be used for electrochemical deposition of thin films or for determining suitable reduction potential range of the ions present in electrolyte for electrochemical deposition. CV can also be used to determine the electron stoichiometry of a system, the diffusion coefficient of an analyte, and the formal reduction potential of an analyte, which can be used as an identification tool. In addition, because concentration is proportional to current in a reversible, Nernstian system, the concentration of an unknown solution can be determined by generating a calibration curve of current vs. concentration.

In cellular biology it is used to measure the concentrations in living organisms. In organometallic chemistry, it is used to evaluate redox mechanisms.

== Measuring antioxidant capacity ==
Cyclical voltammetry can be used to determine the antioxidant capacity in food and even skin. Low molecular weight antioxidants, molecules that prevent other molecules from being oxidized by acting as reducing agents, are important in living cells because they inhibit cell damage or death caused by oxidation reactions that produce radicals. Examples of antioxidants include flavonoids, whose antioxidant activity is greatly increased with more hydroxyl groups. Because traditional methods to determine antioxidant capacity involve tedious steps, techniques to increase the rate of the experiment are continually being researched. One such technique involves cyclic voltammetry because it can measure the antioxidant capacity by quickly measuring the redox behavior over a complex system without the need to measure each component&#x27;s antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, antioxidants are quickly oxidized at inert electrodes, so the half-wave potential can be utilized to determine antioxidant capacity. It is important to note that whenever cyclic voltammetry is utilized, it is usually compared to spectrophotometry or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Applications of the technique extend to food chemistry, where it is used to determine the antioxidant activity of red wine, chocolate, and hops. Additionally, it even has uses in the world of medicine in that it can determine antioxidants in the skin.

===Evaluation of a technique===
The technique being evaluated uses voltammetric sensors combined in an electronic tongue (ET) to observe the antioxidant capacity in red wines. These electronic tongues (ETs) consist of multiple sensing units like voltammetric sensors, which will have unique responses to certain compounds. This approach is optimal to use since samples of high complexity can be analyzed with high cross-selectivity. Thus, the sensors can be sensitive to pH and antioxidants. As usual, the voltage in the cell was monitored using a working electrode and a reference electrode (silver/silver chloride electrode). Furthermore, a platinum counter electrode allows the current to continue to flow during the experiment. The Carbon Paste Electrodes sensor (CPE) and the Graphite-Epoxy Composite (GEC) electrode are tested in a saline solution before the scanning of the wine so that a reference signal can be obtained. The wines are then ready to be scanned, once with CPE and once with GEC. While cyclic voltammetry was successfully used to generate currents using the wine samples, the signals were complex and needed an additional extraction stage. It was found that the ET method could successfully analyze wine&#x27;s antioxidant capacity as it agreed with traditional methods like TEAC, Folin-Ciocalteu, and I280 indexes. Additionally, the time was reduced, the sample did not have to be pretreated, and other reagents were unnecessary, all of which diminished the popularity of traditional methods. Thus, cyclic voltammetry successfully determines the antioxidant capacity and even improves previous results.

===Antioxidant capacity of chocolate and hops===
The phenolic antioxidants for cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate can also be determined via cyclic voltammetry. In order to achieve this, the anodic peaks are calculated and analyzed with the knowledge that the first and third anodic peaks can be assigned to the first and second oxidation of flavonoids, while the second anodic peak represents phenolic acids. Using the graph produced by cyclic voltammetry, the total phenolic and flavonoid content can be deduced in each of the three samples. It was observed that cocoa powder and dark chocolate had the highest antioxidant capacity since they had high total phenolic and flavonoid content. Milk chocolate had the lowest capacity as it had the lowest phenolic and flavonoid content. While the antioxidant content was given using the cyclic voltammetry anodic peaks, HPLC must then be used to determine the purity of catechins and procyanidin in cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and milk chocolate.

Hops, the flowers used in making beer, contain antioxidant properties due to the presence of flavonoids and other polyphenolic compounds. In this cyclic voltammetry experiment, the working electrode voltage was determined using a ferricinium/ferrocene reference electrode. By comparing different hop extract samples, it was observed that the sample containing polyphenols that were oxidized at less positive potentials proved to have better antioxidant capacity.

<text>Cornelius Harnett (April 10, 1723 – April 20, 1781) was an American Founding Father, politician, merchant, plantation owner, and slaveholder from Wilmington, North Carolina. He was a leading American Revolutionary statesman in the Cape Fear region, and a delegate for North Carolina in the Continental Congress from 1777 to 1779 where he signed the Articles of Confederation. Cornelius Harnett is the namesake of Harnett County, North Carolina.

==Personal life==
Harnett was born on April 10, 1723, to Cornelius and Elizabeth Harnett in Chowan County, North Carolina. Soon after he was born, his parents moved to Wilmington. As an adult, he obtained a plantation in Wilmington. He became a leading merchant there and was interested in farming, milling, and mercantile ventures. Harnett was an Episcopalian but has also been identified as a deist. Though he was an intelligent man, there is little known about his educational background. His intelligence served him well in his passion for politics.

Harnett married Mary Holt where they lived on his second plantation, Poplar Grove, located in Scotts Hill, which is north of Wilmington. During Harnett&#x27;s political career, he maintained his relationship with his wife through letters.

Harnett&#x27;s death came about after being captured and &quot;thrown across a horse like a sack of meal&quot;. He was captured by the British upon their occupation of Wilmington in January 1781. His health steadily declined while imprisoned. He died April 20, 1781, shortly after being released on parole.

==Political career==
In 1750 Harnett became involved in public affairs when he was elected Wilmington town commissioner. He was appointed a justice of the peace for New Hanover County by Governor Gabriel Johnston. Harnett was elected to represent Wilmington in the Province of North Carolina House of Burgesses in 1754 and 1775.

In 1765, Harnett became the chairman of the Sons of Liberty and was a leader in the resistance to the Stamp Act. In 1775–1776, he served as the first president of the North Carolina Provincial Council, or Council of safety, essentially the chief executive of the revolutionary state, although with limited powers. In 1776, he was excepted by Sir Henry Clinton from his proclamation of general amnesty. He was a member of the Continental Congress for 1777–1779. He is a signatory to the Articles of Confederation.

Harnett was delegate from Wilmington to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th North Carolina Provincial Congress. He was a delegate from Brunswick County and Vice President of the Fifth North Carolina Provincial Congress.

<text>Schumacher College was based on the Dartington Hall estate near Totnes, Devon, England, and offered ecology-centred degree programmes, short courses and horticultural programmes from 1991 until 2024. In addition to British and European students, it was attended by international students from countries such as Brazil, Japan and the United States.

== Description ==
The college was co-founded in 1990 by Satish Kumar, John Lane, Stephan Harding, Anne Phillips and others. They were inspired by E. F. Schumacher, the economist, environmentalist and author of &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot;, which argued that the growth of capitalism came at a very high human and planetary cost. The first course ran in 1991 with visiting teacher James Lovelock, best known for proposing the Gaia hypothesis.

All courses were centred around holism, ecology and sustainability. The college was committed to reversing the notion of education focussing on academic theory, and so all students were invited to engage hands-on with food growing in the gardens and preparation of meals in the kitchen.

In 2019 the College was named as a finalist in the Green Gown Awards which celebrate sustainability in education. The vegetarian College was recognised in the Food and Drink category as over half the food eaten by staff and students was grown in the College gardens by volunteers and students on the horticulture programmes.

The college was run by the Schumacher College Foundation, a registered charity. It has close links with the Dartington Hall Trust, a charity established in 1980 in part to continue the philanthropic work of the Elmhirst family, owners of the Dartington Hall estate. The college was based on the 1,200-acre estate, northwest of the town of Totnes, Devon.

The foundation suspended all academic programming with immediate effect in September 2024; the Dartington Trust said the college had been incurring substantial monthly losses. 

== Courses ==
In partnership with the University of Plymouth, Schumacher College offered an MA Engaged Ecology, MA Movement, Mind and Ecology, Transformative Education, MSc Regenerative Food and Farming, MA Ecological Design Thinking and MA Regenerative Economics. 

The college ran residential and online short courses throughout the year and a 6-month horticulture residency. They were designed to combine personal transformation and collective action through bridging the gap between theory and practice, knowledge and experience. 

In 2022, the college launched undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in regenerative farming, to become the first higher education provider in England to offer agricultural training exclusively focussed on ecologically-minded approaches to food production.

In 2019, the college developed its masters programmes to encompass a blended learning model to allow students to remain primarily in-country and study at the college in intensive two-week blocks.

<doc id="1101874" wikidata="Q6441494" url="?curid=1101874" title="Kuchi shōga">
<text>, also known as kuchi showa or kuchi shoka, is an educational musical notation for traditional Japanese drums, particularly the taiko and the tsuzumi.

&quot;Kuchi shōga&quot; phoneticizes (that is, phonetically articulates) drum strokes using Japanese sound symbolism. Each syllable conveys information about how the drummer is to play a particular note.

Kuchi shōga notation is written in katakana, a syllabary familiar to all literate Japanese language speakers. Kuchi shōga can be transliterated from katakana to a Latin alphabet using one of the various systems of &quot;rōmaji&quot;.

==Common phoneticizations==
Although kuchi shōga does not have a fixed vocabulary, some phoneticizations are ubiquitous. &quot;Don&quot; typically means a deep, sustained sound from the center of the taiko. &quot;Do&quot; sometimes represents a short beat that is not allowed to resonate (i.e., one with a short decay). &quot;Doko&quot;, &quot;dogo&quot;, or &quot;doro&quot; means two drum-beats played in rapid succession. &quot;Tsu&quot; represents a lightly struck note; &quot;tsuku&quot; implies two soft &quot;tsu&quot; beats in rapid succession—one on the right side of the drum, the other on the left. &quot;Ka&quot; means a sharp tap on the rim of the taiko, and &quot;kara&quot; describes alternate right and left taps.

Taiko players commonly phoneticize a right-handed bachi stroke with &quot;don&quot;, &quot;do&quot;, &quot;tsu&quot;, or &quot;ka&quot;, respectively; and a reserve &quot;kon&quot;, &quot;ko&quot;, &quot;ku&quot;, and &quot;ra&quot; for left-handed strokes.

Two syllables are reserved for strokes on the tsuzumi, a drum that is much smaller than the taiko: &quot;Ta&quot; describes a tap on the side of the drum; &quot;pon&quot; refers to a stroke on the center of the drumhead.

===Rests===
Rests are variously indicated with fricative syllables, such as &quot;sa&quot; and &quot;ho&quot;; or with semivowels, such as &quot;iya&quot;. A polysyllable, such as &quot;sore&quot; and &quot;dokkoi&quot;, indicates a two-beat rest.

This is called &quot;kakegoe.&quot; If the rest is not sung, the space is often filled with unscripted sounds called kiais. Explicitly assigning words to represent the periods of silence in a song is likely linked to the Japanese concept of &quot;ma&quot;, where the space between notes is as important as the notes themselves in a performance.

==Sample notation==
The following is an example of kuchi shōga notation transliterated in &quot;rōmaji&quot;:

Don (tsu) doko don, don (tsu) don kon, doko don (tsu) don

When played in common time, this sequence constitutes three measures: 1 . 3&amp;4, 1 . 3 4, 1&amp;2 . 4. The sticking, describing which hand the note is played with (R= Right, L=Left), is: R . RLR, R . R L, RLR . R

<doc id="1101876" wikidata="Q3007333" url="?curid=1101876" title="Culture of Greenland">
<text>The culture of [[Greenland]] has much in common with Greenlandic Inuit tradition, as the majority of people are descended from Inuit. Many people still go ice fishing and there are annual dog-sled races in which everyone with a team participates.

However, Greenland has now become somewhat of a tourist attraction. It holds contests to attract tourists such as dog racing, ice fishing, hiking, and cross country racing.

==Inuit==
Inuit account for 81% (2005) of the population of Greenland. Hunting is iconic to their culture and most Greenlanders still hunt at least part-time to supplement their diet and provide skins for clothing and kayaks.

== Thule region ==
The northwest corner of Greenland is known as the Thule region. It is roughly the size of Germany, but inhabited by less than 1,000 people. The northernmost year-round communities on earth (Siorapaluk, Moriusaq, Savissivik, Qeqertat, and Qaanaaq) are in the Thule region. Siorapaluk, with approximately 80 residents, is just 730 nautical miles (1,360 km) from the North Pole.

Currently, though most families in the Thule region need at least one member in salaried employment in order to pay for electricity and other modern amenities, hunting remains a revered profession. Traditional foods like seal, walrus, narwhal and caribou are consumed frequently. Hunters still wear hand-made polar bear skin garments, caribou anoraks and skin boots for warmth on winter hunting trips. Many of the men maintain world-class kayaking and harpoon-throwing skills.

== Inuit identity as hunters ==

=== Cultural status of the hunting experience ===
Hunting has always been an important aspect of the Greenland Inuit culture:

: &quot;The Inuit culture is the most pure hunting culture in existence. Having adapted to the extreme living conditions in the High Arctic of the North American continent for at least four thousand years, Inuit are not even hunter-gatherers. Inuit are hunters, pure and simple.&quot; (Henriette Rasmussen, Minister in Greenland Home Rule Government)

Even today hunting is important as stated by the Greenland Home Rule Government:

: &quot;Hunting is the heart and soul of Greenlandic culture... Hunting is also very important from a cultural perspective. In a society such as Greenland, which for centuries was based on subsistence hunting (until about 50 years ago), hunting is still of great cultural importance. Irrespective of the fact that most live like wage-earners in a modern industrial society, many Greenlanders&#x27; identity is still deeply rooted in the hunting.&quot;

Reindeer hunting has a special status in the hearts of the populace. Shooting a musk ox provides four times as much meat as a reindeer, but &quot;Greenlanders would much rather have caribou or reindeer meat than musk or ox meat,&quot; says Josephine Nymand. &quot;But the experience is just as important as the meat,&quot; points out Peter Nielsen, Head of Office at the Ministry of Environment and Nature. &quot;It is simply the most wonderful part of the year. The trips in for the caribou hunt in the beautiful autumn weather have a great social and physical meaning for people&#x27;s wellbeing. It has many functions.&quot;

=== Inuit culture ===

The long history of mutual dependence between humans and reindeer necessitates continuing efforts to safeguard their relationship and the welfare of both parties. Reindeer hunting – which is also commonplace in many other parts of the world – is considered so vital to the cultural heritage of certain groups that there is an attempt being made to get it placed on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List.
The identity of the Inuit is closely tied to their geography, history and their attitudes toward hunting – &quot;For Inuit, ecology, hunting and culture are synonymous&quot;. Their identity as hunters is under attack. Those attacks are &quot;... viewed in the Arctic as a direct assault on culture, identity as well as sustainable use&quot;, and Inuit are reacting:

: &quot;... for the Inuit, animal rights campaigns are just the latest in a long litany of religious, industry, and government policies imposed by outsiders – policies which ignore Inuit values and realities, and threaten the survival of one of the world&#x27;s last remaining aboriginal hunting cultures.&quot;

Therefore, the circumpolar peoples and their organizations are actively engaged in attempts to protect their welfare, identity, interests, and culture, including their hunting culture. The &quot;Kuujjuaq Declaration&quot; addressed perceived attacks on their autonomy and rights, and recommended that the Inuit Circumpolar Council &quot;undertake a comprehensive study on how best to address global forces, such as the &#x27;animal rights&#x27; and other destructive movements that aim to destroy Inuit sustainable use of living resources, and to report back to the next General Assembly on its findings.&quot; The International Arctic Science Committee shares these viewpoints and therefore one of its objectives is to study the &quot;sustainable use of living resources of high value to Arctic residents.&quot;

=== Controversy ===
As valued as it is, traditional hunting in Greenland is under tremendous stress. Pressure from environmental and conservation groups has led Greenland&#x27;s Home Rule Government to set hunting limits for most species. In January 2006, a 150 animal limit was set for the most prized of all Greenlandic animals, the polar bear.

=== Climate change ===
Another pressure for Greenland&#x27;s hunters is climate change. According to the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, the largest study ever conducted on the effects of warming in the Arctic, winter temperatures above the 63rd parallel north have increased on average, by 2 to 5 Celsius over the past 50 years and could rise by yet another 10. That increase is having a dramatic effect on the wildlife, environment and culture of the high Arctic. In an interview for the Arctic I.C.C.E. Project, Savissavik hunter Simon Eliason said hunters are spending more time in the fjords (rather than on the sea ice) because there is less sea ice on which to hunt seal, walrus and polar bear. He also said that hunters who net seals under the ice in winter must pull in those nets within hours after an animal is caught. Worms and parasites that the hunters have never seen before rapidly riddle and destroy the carcasses if they are left in the water very long. Eliassen says he believes the parasites have moved north with the warmer water.

== Traditional skills at risk ==
Finally, traditional Thule culture is threatened by development and the growing cash-based economy. Even the smallest settlements in northwest Greenland have electricity today, albeit a small supply of electricity powered by diesel generators. Having electricity, as well as ammunition, hunting rifles and other store-bought products, means that at least one member of every family must be in salaried employment. In most cases, that member is a woman—a wife, daughter or mother. The jobs held by the women allow the men to continue to hunt full-time. But one consequence of this division of labor is that Thule women are losing their knowledge of traditional skills faster than the men. These skills include flensing, treating and sewing skins.

<text>Horns Rev is a shallow sandy reef of glacial deposits in the eastern North Sea, about off the westernmost point of Denmark, Blåvands Huk. For many years Horns Rev was marked by a lightship, though that has now been replaced by light buoys.
The reef is the site of the Horns Rev Offshore Wind Farm.

== Horns Rev offshore wind farm ==

At Horns Rev the Danish Energy company Elsam (now Ørsted) built the first offshore wind farm in the North Sea. 
When the first phase was inaugurated in 2002, Horns Rev wind farm was the first large scale offshore wind farm in the world at 160 MW, four times larger than the previous largest offshore wind farm in the world, the Middelgrunden at 40MW.

A total of 80 Vestas V80-2.0 MW units, capable of producing 160 MW, were installed by the Danish offshore wind farms services provider A2SEA in 2002 with the last turbine coming into operation on 11 December 2002. It receives a guaranteed price of 0.453 DKK/kWh for the first 42,000 hours, paid by electricity consumers. Since 2005, the wind farm has been owned and operated by Vattenfall. It cost DKK2bn. A radar has shown details of the wind patterns, improving local short-term forecasting.

Turbines are laid out as an oblique rectangle of 5 km x 3.8 km (8 horizontal and 10 vertical rows). The distance between turbines is 560 m in both directions.

The main method of transport to the first wind park is an adapted Eurocopter EC-135 helicopter when winds are less than 19 m/s. Hoisting the workers to and from a small platform on each turbine allows access to the park regardless of sea conditions which would otherwise prevent sailing in the area for a large part of the year.

Vattenfall can change a gearbox in a day, and the farm has an availability of 96-97%. Two turbines are burnt out, and are uneconomic to replace with less than 10 years left.

In April 2012, most of the Danish Folketing (parliament) agreed to send out tenders in 2013 for a 400 MW wind farm at Horns Rev called Horns Rev 3, and a 600 MW at Kriegers Flak in the Baltic Sea, both likely receiving 90 øre/kWh for the first 50,000 hours. This was expected to raise wind power in Denmark above the current 39% of annual electricity production, which includes the 400 MW Anholt Offshore Wind Farm. Some of the area is an old minefield from World War Two. Four bidders were qualified for the tender.

Vattenfall won the tender in February 2015, at a price of 77 øre/kWh, well below the 105 øre at Anholt. Vattenfall states that they bid unaggressively against strong competition without sacrificing margins. The price reduction contributes to a smaller &quot;green subsidy&quot; (PSO) over the next years. A total of 49 Vestas V164-8.3 MW units, capable of producing 406.7 MW, will be installed. Three transformers were installed in July 2016.

Findings released from an eight-year study about offshore wind farms in Denmark show that the projects &quot;operate in harmony with the surrounding environment&quot;. The 2006 report confirms that both the Horns Rev and Nysted offshore wind farms will double in size in the coming years.

<doc id="1101885" wikidata="Q2463390" url="?curid=1101885" title="Wilbur Shaw">
<text>Warren Wilbur Shaw (October 31, 1902 – October 30, 1954) was an American racing driver. The second three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500 (1937, 1939 and 1940), he is also remembered for serving as president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway from 1945 until his death in 1954. 

== Early life ==

Shaw was born in Shelbyville, Indiana on October 31, 1902.

== Racing career ==

Shaw first participated in the 1927 Indianapolis 500. He eventually won the Indianapolis 500 race three times, in 1937, 1939, and 1940. Shaw was the second person to win the 500 three times, and the first to win it twice in a row. In 1939 and 1940, he won driving a Maserati 8CTF named the &#x27;Boyle Special.&#x27; In the 1941 race, Shaw was injured when his car crashed; it was later discovered that a defective wheel had been placed on his car.

== Indianapolis Motor Speedway President ==

During World War II, Shaw was hired by the tire manufacturer Firestone Tire and Rubber Company to test a synthetic rubber automobile tire at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS), which had been closed due to the war. He was dismayed at the dilapidated condition of the racetrack and quickly contacted then-owner Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace and president and founder of Eastern Air Lines. When the United States entered World War II, ending racing at Indianapolis and elsewhere for the duration, Rickenbacker padlocked the gates, and the race course slowly begin to disintegrate.

During a meeting soon after the test, Rickenbacker informed Shaw that what was left of the track would be demolished and the land turned into a housing subdivision. Shaw sent out letters to the major car manufacturers trying to find a backer to buy the speedway. However, all indicated that should they buy the IMS they would turn it into a private testing facility for their own cars only.

Shaw then met Terre Haute businessman Tony Hulman who had inherited his family&#x27;s business, Hulman &amp; Company, a wholesale grocer and producer of coffee and baking powder, Clabber Girl.

A lifelong fan of automobile racing in general and the &quot;500&quot; in particular, Hulman listened with great interest to what Shaw had to say. Despite what Hulman saw amongst the weeds and deterioration when Shaw took him to Indianapolis, he purchased the Speedway from Rickenbacker in November 1945 for the sum of $750,000.

As a reward for his efforts to revive the Speedway, Shaw was appointed as its president, where he would have complete day-to-day control over the track. To this job, Shaw brought his extensive knowledge of the business of auto racing, something Hulman would admit that he himself didn&#x27;t have, and Shaw&#x27;s hard work only cemented the reputation of the &quot;500&quot; as the &quot;Greatest Spectacle in Racing.&quot;

It seemed as though Shaw and Hulman had a &quot;Midas touch&quot; at the Speedway. Hulman poured money into improvements, and Shaw delivered the world&#x27;s greatest automobile race to enthusiastic crowds, which grew in number by the year. The Indianapolis &quot;500&quot; of the late Forties and early Fifties was a very special event through the work of Hulman and Shaw, although Hulman was always sure to point out that it was Wilbur putting it all together.

== Death ==

Shaw was killed in an airplane crash near Decatur, Indiana, on October 30, 1954, one day before his fifty-second birthday. The pilot, Ray Grimes, and artist Ernest Roose were also killed.

== Other work and legacy ==

Shaw was the automotive test evaluator for &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine. As the automotive test evaluator, Shaw&#x27;s articles were superior to those of his contemporaries in that they gave consistently accurate reports without relying on &quot;Popular Science&quot;&#x27;s lead in the marketplace over competitors such as &quot;Mechanix Illustrated&quot;.

Shaw&#x27;s highly regarded autobiography, &quot;Gentlemen, Start your Engines,&quot; was published in 1955, and covers events through 1953.

As of 2024, he is the last Indiana native to win the Indianapolis 500.

== Awards and honors ==

Shaw has been inducted into the following halls of fame:
* Auto Racing Hall of Fame (1963)
* Automotive Hall of Fame (1987)
* National Sprint Car Hall of Fame (1990)
* International Motorsports Hall of Fame (1991)
* Motorsports Hall of Fame of America (1991)

Shaw has been awarded the following honors:

* Automotive Hall of Fame Distinguished Service Citation (1951)

<text>The Small School was a coeducational private school for children ages 11–16, located in Hartland, Devon, England, that closed in 2016.

==History==
Satish Kumar, who also founded &quot;Resurgence&quot; magazine, lived in the rural village, and did not want to send his 10-year-old son to the nearest secondary school, either in Bude or Bideford. He decided to set up a school in the village. The Small School was founded in September 1982, and had a choice of afternoon options including: photography, yoga, pottery, woodwork. Unlike other state schools, the Small School was known for its pupils growing, cooking, and serving their own lunches. The Small School began with 8 children and grew to as many as 35.

On 20 May 2015 an Ofsted inspection found the school inadequate. Two additional inspections were undertaken in 2016 and Ofsted shows that the School was closed later that year (https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/27/113611)

<text>The Bermuda national football team represents Bermuda in international football, and is controlled by the Bermuda Football Association, which is a member of the CONCACAF.

==History==
===1964–1992===
Bermuda played their first international match on 10 August 1964, against Iceland in Reykjavík, ending in a narrow victory to the Icelanders, 4–3. Some years later, Bermuda played in the 1967 Pan American Games, reaching the final, before being defeated by Mexico, 4–0. In 1968 they participated in the qualifiers for the 1970 FIFA World Cup for the first time. In Group 1 of the first round, they were paired with United States and Canada. They finished the group with one draw (against Canada, 0–0) and three losses and were eliminated. The sixties would end with an elimination at the hands of Mexico, in the 1969 CONCACAF Championship qualification preliminary round, although Bermuda, after having lost 3–0 in Mexico City, managed to defeat the Aztecs 2–1 in Hamilton, on 2 November 1969, with goals from Albert Dowling and Bernard Brangman.

The &#x27;70s would begin with another elimination in the first round of the 1971 CONCACAF Championship qualification, again at the hands of Mexico, which prevailed comfortably with an overall result of 6–0. In this decade the Bermuda team managed to win two consecutive bronze medals in the Central American and Caribbean Games of 1974 and 1978. The decade of the &#x27;80s was not very significant for the &quot;Gombey Warriors&quot; since they only participated in the 1982 Central American and Caribbean Games, a tournament where reached 4th place. This would be their final participation in the Games.

On the other hand, between 1967 and 1987, the Bermuda team played several qualifying matches for the Olympic soccer tournament but never qualified for the final tournament. In this period they experienced some of their worst defeats, such as two 8–0 results against Canada and Mexico.

===1992–2013===
Absent from the World Cup qualifiers between 1972 and 1992, Bermuda returned to the 1994 preliminary tournament where they eliminated Haiti in the first round thanks to the away goals rule, after winning 1–0 in Hamilton (goal by Shaun Goater) and lost 2–1 in Port-au-Prince. Bermuda advanced to the second phase, in group B with Jamaica, Canada and El Salvador, finishing in last place with 4 points, despite managing a historic 1–0 victory against the &quot;Selecta&quot;, the result of a goal from Kyle Lightbourne. In the 1998 World Cup qualifiers, Bermuda withdrew without playing Trinidad and Tobago in the first round.

The &quot;Gombey Warriors&quot; would return four years later for the 2002 World Cup qualifiers where they eliminated the British Virgin Islands in the first round, 5–1 and 9–0, before falling in the next phase, at the hands of Antigua and Barbuda, who won thanks to the away goal rule after drawing 0–0 at Saint John&#x27;s and 1–1 in Hamilton. In the tournament preliminary route to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Bermuda got their biggest win, thrashing Montserrat 13–0. Later it was eliminated by El Salvador who prevailed 2–1 in San Salvador and later drew 2–2 in Hamilton. In the qualifying process for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Bermuda eliminated the Cayman Islands in the first round with an aggregate score of 4–1. But it was brought down in the next round by Trinidad and Tobago with an aggregate score of 3–2 although Bermuda achieved an away victory, in Macoya, against the &quot;Soca Warriors&quot; (1–2), with a double from John Nusum. In the 2014 World Cup qualifiers, Bermuda entered the second round directly in group B, alongside Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Barbados. Although they again defeated Trinidad and Tobago (2–1), they could only finish third in the group with 10 points, failing to advance to the third round.

On the other hand, since 1997, Bermuda began to play regularly in the knockout phase of the Caribbean Cup (except in 2001 and 2010) although it never managed to qualify for the final round. Their best performance occurred in the 2007 tournament where they advanced to the second knockout round.

In July 2013, Bermuda claimed the 15th gold medal at the 2013 Island Games, held in Hamilton. This competition is not officially recognised because teams not recognized by FIFA participate.

===2015–present===

In 2015 Bermuda participated in the 2018 World Cup Qualifiers where they would face the Bahamas, whom they defeated over the two matches by 5–0. Going into the second round, they faced Guatemala, drawing 0–0 then falling 1–0, failing to reach the third round. Bermuda would return to the Caribbean Cup after being absent in 2014, losing initially against Cuba 2–1 but defeating French Guiana 2–1 to edge through to the second round on goal-difference. They then lost to both Dominican Republic (2–1) and French Guiana (3–0) and were eliminated from the cup.

In 2019, Bermuda debuted in the CONCACAF Nations League where Bermuda made history by qualifying into League A of the competition and, consequently, a chance to qualify for their first CONCACAF Gold Cup. In League A, Bermuda were drawn with Mexico and Panama but finished at the bottom of the group on goal-difference, forcing them into a qualification round for the Gold Cup. They defeated Barbados 8–1 in the first round but, in the final qualifying round, lost to Haiti 4–1 and were eliminated.

==== FIFA Series tournament ====
In 2024, FIFA Invited Bermuda to the 2024 FIFA Series matches from 22 to 26 March 2024 held in Jeddah where they would face their first ever opponent outside CONCACAF. On 22 March 2024, Bermuda faced off against Brunei from the AFC, where they defeated them 2–0.

<text>Tottenham High Cross was erected in Tottenham sometime between 1600 and 1609 by Owen Wood, Dean of Armagh, on the site of a wooden wayside cross first mentioned in 1409, and marks what was the centre of Tottenham Village. It is situated on a low summit on Ermine Street, which became the Tottenham High Road, as it is now known.

The high cross was constructed of plain brick, in an octagonal, four level design, which was later stuccoed and ornamented in the Gothic style in 1809.

Tottenham High Cross is often mistakenly thought to be an Eleanor cross, possibly because it is only a few miles south of one of the true Eleanor crosses at Waltham Cross.

<doc id="1101949" wikidata="Q5605054" url="?curid=1101949" title="Orthoceras">
<text>Orthoceras is a genus of extinct nautiloid cephalopod restricted to Middle Ordovician-aged marine limestones of the Baltic States and Sweden. This genus is sometimes called &quot;Orthoceratites&quot;. Note it is sometimes misspelled as &quot;Orthocera&quot;, &quot;Orthocerus&quot; or &quot;Orthoceros&quot;.

&quot;Orthoceras&quot; was formerly thought to have had a worldwide distribution due to the genus&#x27; use as a wastebasket taxon for numerous species of conical-shelled nautiloids throughout the Paleozoic and Triassic. Since this work was carried out and re-cataloging of the genus, &quot;Orthoceras&quot; &quot;sensu stricto&quot; refers to Orthoceras regulare, of Ordovician-aged Baltic Sea limestones of Sweden and neighboring areas.

These are slender, elongate shells with the middle of the body chamber transversely constricted, and a subcentral orthochoanitic siphuncle. The surface is ornamented by a network of fine lirae . Many other very similar species are included under the genus &quot;Michelinoceras&quot;.

== History of the name ==
Originally &quot;Orthoceras&quot; referred to all nautiloids with a straight-shell, called an &quot;orthocone&quot; . But later research on their internal structures, such as the siphuncle, cameral deposits, and others, showed that these actually belong to a number of groups, even different orders.

According to the authoritative Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, the name &quot;Orthoceras&quot; is now only used to refer to the type species &quot;O. regulare&quot; from the Middle Ordovician of Sweden and parts of the former Soviet Union such as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia and Lithuania. The genus might include a few related species.

== Confusion with &quot;Baculites&quot; ==

&quot;Orthoceras&quot; and related orthoconic nautiloid cephalopods
are often confused with the superficially similar &quot;Baculites&quot; and related Cretaceous orthoconic ammonoids. Both are long and tubular in form, and both are common items for sale in rock shops (often under each other&#x27;s names). Both lineages evidently evolved the tubular form independently of one another, and at different times in earth history. &quot;Orthoceras&quot; lived much earlier (Middle Ordovician) than &quot;Baculites&quot; (Late Cretaceous). The two types of fossils can be distinguished by many features, most obvious among which is the suture line: simple in &quot;Orthoceras&quot; (see image), intricately foliated in &quot;Baculites&quot; and related forms.

<text>The Protei-5 (Протей-5) is a small Russian one-man diver propulsion vehicle often used by Russian commando frogmen. It is battery electric powered, using six non-sealed lead–acid batteries. It clips on under the diver with a clip over each shoulder and one up between his legs. Its casing is aluminium. It was intended to be clipped onto the outside of a submarine; near the operation site the frogmen would airlock out underwater and unhitch their Protei 5&#x27;s and ride them to the operation site. It seems to have been intended to be ridden fast and far rather than for complicated maneuvering.

The Russian for this sort of &quot;diver-carrying vehicle&quot; is буксировщик &quot;buksirovshchik&quot; = &quot;tugger&quot;.

The rod sticking out of the front end was meant to carry a lamp.&lt;br&gt;
The lever on the left bow is the motor&#x27;s on/off switch. There is no speed control.&lt;br&gt;
The frogman steers with the diving fins on his feet.&lt;br&gt;
Overall size: 66 centimetres (2 feet 2 inches) wide, 69 centimetres (2 feet 3 inches) high, 1.75 (5 feet 9 inches) long.&lt;br&gt;
Size of hull: 66 centimetres (2 feet 2 inches) wide, 38 centimetres (1 feet 3 inches) high, 1.45 m (4 feet 9 inches) long.

A frogman with an IDA71 rebreather riding a Protei-7 could pass through a hole square.

Only two Protei-5 are known to exist outside of the ex-USSR:
* One is currently in upstate New York, USA.
* One is fully operational in New Jersey, USA; it was made in 1970 and its motor is noisy. This example was imported along with some 150 IDA-59, IDA-64, IDA-71, and AKA-60 rebreathers, all ex-Soviet military combat swimmers&#x27; systems.

Similar designs have been made in Russia, including a model called Proton.

The name &quot;Protei&quot; is a Russian version of the classical Latin / Greek mythological name Proteus.

<text>William Francis Messner-Loebs (; born William Francis Loebs, Jr., February 19, 1949) is an American comics artist and writer from Michigan, also known as Bill Loebs and Bill Messner-Loebs. His hyphenated surname is a combination of his and his wife Nadine&#x27;s unmarried surnames.

In the 1980s and 1990s he wrote runs of series published by DC Comics, Image Comics, , and other comics publishers, including DC&#x27;s superhero series &quot;Flash&quot; and &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; among others. Additionally he has both written and drawn original creator-owned works, such as &quot;&quot;.

==Biography==
William Messner-Loebs was born in Ferndale, Michigan. His right arm was amputated above the shoulder in infancy because of a cancerous tumor; he writes and draws with his left hand.

Loebs was a friend of Kevin Siembieda, and played in Siembieda&#x27;s role-playing group in Detroit; in 1981, his mother Frances (Schepeler) Loebs loaned Siembieda the money to start publishing role-playing books for his company Palladium Books.

His first comics work was for Power Comics Company and on Noble Comics&#x27; &quot;Justice Machine&quot; with Mike Gustovich. His first ongoing series was &quot;Journey: The Adventures of Wolverine MacAlistaire&quot;, about 19th-century Michigan frontier life, which he both wrote and illustrated. It was published from 1983 to 1986 by Aardvark-Vanaheim and Fantagraphics, followed by a limited series &quot;Journey: Wardrums&quot;. He wrote the 31-issue &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; series published by from 1986 to 1988 and collaborated with artist Adam Kubert on the &quot;Jezebel Jade&quot; limited series, a spin-off from the &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; series.

In 1988, he began writing &quot;The Flash&quot; with issue #15 and continued through #61. He and artist Greg LaRocque introduced Linda Park as a supporting character in the series in &quot;The Flash&quot; vol. 2 #28 (July 1989). He also reintroduced the Pied Piper as a reformed villain and established the character as gay, in issue #53 (Aug. 1991).

Meanwhile, he wrote &quot;Dr. Fate&quot; #25-41 and the &quot;Jaguar&quot; series for DC&#x27;s Impact Comics imprint. He wrote &quot;Epicurus the Sage&quot; which was illustrated by Sam Kieth, and scripted &quot;The Maxx&quot; which was illustrated and co-written by Kieth. In 1990, Messner-Loebs became the writer of the &quot;Batman&quot; newspaper comic strip and wrote the strip until its cancellation the following year.

In 1992 Loebs took over writing the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; series, with pencils by Mike Deodato. During his run from #63 to #100, he created the character Artemis of Bana-Mighdall, for whom he wrote the mini-series &quot;Artemis: Requiem&quot;. Meanwhile, he wrote &quot;Hawkman&quot; #9-27, penciled primarily by Steve Lieber. In 1996 he had a brief run writing Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Thor&quot;. From 1997 to 1999 he wrote &quot;Impulse&quot; #29-49, penciled by Craig Rousseau. In 1999 he wrote the &quot;V2K&quot; mini-series &quot;Brave Old World&quot; for Vertigo, penciled by Guy Davis.

In 2005, following years of limited freelance work and the loss of his and his wife&#x27;s home in the early 2000s, Messner-Loebs&#x27;s financial condition was publicized in the local newspaper and comics news sites and Internet message boards. Author Clifford Meth teamed up with artist Neal Adams to create a benefit auction to help Messner-Loebs. The two also created an art tribute book entitled &quot;Heroes &amp; Villains&quot; with all proceeds aiding Messner-Loebs.

His financial situation improved somewhat, and he had a number of works published, including an issue of &quot;Green Arrow&quot; in 2005, and several pieces in &quot;The Three Tenors&quot; (Aardwolf Publishing), which he shared credits for along with Clifford Meth and artist Dave Cockrum. A new &quot;Journey&quot; story was included in the one-shot &quot;Many Happy Returns&quot; in 2008, and IDW Publishing reprinted the original material in paperback. He has done writing for Boom! Studios, including the four-issue &quot;Necronomicon&quot; and stories for &quot;Zombie Tales&quot;. He has done illustration work for the 2007 humor book &quot;Chicken Wings for the Beer Drinker&#x27;s Soul&quot; and a monthly cartoon for the &quot;Livingston [County, MI] Parent Journal&quot;. In 2008, he discussed additional, more substantial new works with various publishers. In 2011, he wrote the &quot;DC Retroactive: The Flash – The &#x27;80s&quot; and &quot;DC Retroactive: Wonder Woman – The &#x27;90s&quot; one-shots.

As of early 2018, William Messner-Loebs and his wife have continued to struggle financially, with Messner-Loebs working two part-time positions in Michigan. In 2019, he co-wrote, with Amy Chu, issues #3–5 of the limited series &quot;Kiss: The End&quot; for Dynamite Entertainment, and contributed to an independent comic book anthology called &quot;YEET Presents&quot;.

In September 2020, William Messner-Loebs was named Project Editor for Resurgence Comics.

==Awards==
In 1985, Messner-Loebs was nominated for the Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award. He received an Inkpot Award in 1987 and his &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; series from was nominated for the Kirby Award for Best Continuing Series and Best New Series that same year. In 1989, Messner-Loebs was nominated for an Eisner Award as Best Writer for &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; and his &quot;Jezebel Jade&quot; series was nominated for the Eisner Award for Best Finite Series.

For his work on &quot;The Flash&quot;, he received the first GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book in 1992. He received the Bill Finger Award for Writing Excellence in 2017.

In 2009 he won the Macabre Award for his Necronomicon comic book series.

* 1277 (&quot;Kenji 3, 5th month&quot;): Yoshimasa laid down his office.

<text>Soft systems methodology (SSM) is an organised way of thinking applicable to problematic social situations and in the management of change by using action. It was developed in England by academics at the Lancaster Systems Department on the basis of a ten-year action research programme.

== Overview ==

The Soft Systems Methodology was developed primarily by Peter Checkland, through 10 years of research with his colleagues, such as Brian Wilson. The method was derived from numerous earlier systems engineering processes, primarily from the fact traditional &#x27;hard&#x27; systems thinking was not able to account for larger organisational issues, with many complex relationships. SSM has a primary use in the analysis of these complex situations, where there are divergent views about the definition of the problem.

These complex situations are known as &quot;soft problems&quot;. They are usually real world problems where the goals and purposes of the problem are problematic themselves. Examples of soft problems include: How to improve the delivery of health services? and How to manage homelessness with young people? Soft approaches take as tacit that people&#x27;s view of the world will change all the time and their preferences of it will also change.

Depending on the current circumstances of a situation, trying to agree on the problem may be difficult as there might be multiple factors to take into consideration, such as all the different kinds of methods used to tackle these problems. Additionally, Peter Checkland had moved away from the idea of &#x27;obvious&#x27; problems and started working with situations to make concepts of models to use them as a source of questions to help with the problem, soft systems methodologies then started emerging to be an organised learning system.

Purposeful activity models could be declared using worldviews, meaning they were never models of real-world action. Still, those relevant to disclosure and argument about real-world action led to them being called epistemological devices that could be used for discourse and debate. The distinction between the everyday world and systems thinking was to draw attention to the conscious use of systems language in developing intellectual devices which were used to structure debates or an exploration of the problem situation being addressed.

In its &#x27;classic&#x27; form the methodology consists of seven steps, with initial appreciation of the problem situation leading to the modelling of several human activity systems that might be thought relevant to the problem situation. By getting all the relevant people who are the decision-makers in this situation to come together, sit down in discussion and exploration about the definition of the problem. Only then will the decision makers in said situation will more likely arrive at a mutual agreement which will settle any arguments or problems and help get to the solution over exactly what kind of changes could be either systemically desirable and feasible in the situation at hand.

Later explanations of the ideas give a more sophisticated view of this systemic method and give more attention to locating the methodology with respect to its philosophical underpinnings. It is the earlier classical view which is most widely used in practice (created by Peter Checkland). A common criticism of this earlier methodology is that it follows an approach that is too linear. Checkland himself agreed that the earlier methodology is &#x27;rather bald&#x27;. Most advanced SSM analysts will agree, though, that the classical view is an easy way for inexperienced analysts to learn the SSM methodology.

SSM has been successfully used as a business analysis methodology in various fields. Real-world examples of SSM&#x27;s wide range of applicability include research applying SSM in the sugar industry leading to improvements in business partner relationships, successful use as an approach in project management by directly involving stakeholders or aiding in business management by improving communication between stakeholders. It has proven to be a useful analysis approach to teaching and learning processes, as it does not require a specific problem to be identified as its starting point – which has led to &quot;outside of the box&quot; suggestions for improvement. SSM was even used by the UK government as part of the revaluation of their Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM) system development methodology.

Even professional researchers who are to take the change for face value structure of thinking, show the same tendency to distort perceptions of the world rather than change the mental structure which we give our bearings with. Failure of classic systems in rich &#x27;management&#x27; problem situations during the research programme led to examining the adequacy of the systems thinking.

The methodology has been described in several books and many academic articles.

SSM remains the most widely used and practical application of systems thinking, and other systems approaches such as critical systems thinking have incorporated many of its ideas.

== Representation evolution ==
SSM had a gradual development process of the methodology as a whole from 1972 to 1990. During this period of time, four different representations of SSM were designed, becoming more sophisticated and at the same time less structured and broader in scope.

=== Blocks and arrows (1972) ===
The first studies in the research programme were carried out in 1969, and the first account of what became SSM was published in a paper three-years later titled &quot;Towards a systems-based methodology for real-world problem solving&quot; (Checkland 1972). In this paper, soft systems methodology is presented as a sequence of stages with iteration back to previous stages.The sequence was as follows: analysis, root definition of relevant systems, conceptualisation, comparison and definition of changes, selection of change to implement, design of change and implementation and appraisal.

The overall aim to implement change instead of introducing or enhancing a system implies that the thinking was ongoing as a result of these early experiences, even if the straight arrows in the diagrams and the rectangular blocks in some of the models can now be misleading!

===Seven stages (1981)===

Soft systems methodology (SSM) is a powerful tool that is utilised to analyse very complex organisational and systemic problems, that do not have an obvious solution. The methodology incorporates seven steps to come up with a viable solution for the problem defined. The seven steps are;
# Enter situation in which a problem situation(s) have been identified
# Address the issue at hand
# Formulate root definitions of relevant systems of purposeful activity
# Build conceptual models of the systems named in the root definitions : This methodology comes into place from raising concerns/ capturing problems within an organisation and looking into ways how it can be solved. Defining the root definition also describes the root purpose of a system.
# The comparison stage: The systems thinker is to compare the perceived conceptual models against an intuitive perception of a real-world situation or scenario. Checkland defines this stage as the comparison of Stage 4 with Stage 2, formally, &quot;Comparison of 4 with 2&quot;. Parts of the problem situation analysed in Stage 2 are to be examined alongside the conceptual model(s) created in Stage 4, this helps to achieve a &quot;complete&quot; comparison.
# Problems identified should be accompanied now by feasible and desirable changes that will distinctly help the problem situation based in the system given. Human activity systems and other aspects of the system should be considered so that soft systems thinking, and Mumford&#x27;s needs can be achieved with the potential changes. These potential changes should not be acted on until step 7 but they should be feasible enough to act upon to improve the problem situation.
# Take action to improve the problem situation

=== Two streams (1988) ===
The two-stream model of SSM recognizes the crucially important role of history in human affairs, and for a given group of people their history determines what will be noticed as significant and how it will be judged. This expression of SSM is presented as an approach embodying not only a logic-based stream of analysis (via activity models) but also a cultural and political stream which enable judgements to be made about the accommodations between conflicting interests which might be reachable by the people concerned and which would enable action to be taken.

This particular expression of SSM removes the dividing line between the world of the problem situation and the systems thinking world.

=== Four main activities (1990) ===
The four-activities model is iconic rather than descriptive and subsumes the cultural stream of analysis in the four activities. The seven stage model gave an approach which applies real world situations, both large and small and public and private sector. The four main activities were created as a way to capture the more flexible use of SSM and to include more of the cultural aspect of the workplace into the concept of SSM. The four activities are used to show that SSM does not have to be used rigidly; it&#x27;s there to show real life and not be constrained. The four main activities should be seen as an individual concept rather than a descriptive which incorporates the cultural stream of analysis. The four activities are:

# Finding out about a problem situation, including culturally/politically
# Formulating some relevant purposeful activity models: Creating and drawing specific  diagrammatic illustrations of activity processes that occur in an organisation, which shows the relevant processes that take place in a structured order, and depicts any problem situation visually by showing the flow of one action to another. An example of this would be a diagram of a Soft Systems Methodology method, which is a  &#x27;Conceptual Model&#x27;, which is a representation of a systems&#x27; human actions,  or an &#x27;Architecture System Map&#x27;, which is a visual representation of the implementation of sections of a software system.
# Debating the situation, using the models, seeking from that debate both:
#* changes which would improve the situation and are regarded as both desirable and (culturally) feasible, and
#* the accommodations between conflicting interests which will enable action
# Taking action in the situation to bring about improvement

==CATWOE==

In 1975, David Smyth, a researcher in Checkland&#x27;s department, observed that SSM was most successful when the root definition included certain elements. These elements, captured in the mnemonic CATWOE, identified the people, processes and environment that contribute to a situation, issue or problem that required analyzing.

This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. In further detail, CATWOE helps explore a system by underlining the roots which involve turning the inputs into outputs. CATWOE helps businesses as it analyses a gap between current and useful systems. Business perspectives help the business analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved. This mainly involves stakeholders which allows them to test assumptions they have made as stakeholders will all have different opinions about certain problems and opportunities. CATWOE&#x27;s method helps gain better and achievable results, as well as avoiding additional problems using six elements. 
The six elements of CATWOE are:
* Customers – Who are the beneficiaries of the highest level business process and how does the issue affect them?
* Actors - The person or people directly involved in the transformation (T) part of CATWOE (Checkland &amp; Scholes, 1999, p. 35). Implementation and involvement by the actors allows for the input to be transformed into an output (Checkland &amp; Scholes, 1999, p. 35). Actors are also stakeholders as their actions can affect the transformation process and the system as a whole. As actors are directly involved, they also have a &#x27;holon&#x27; by which they interpret the world outside (Checkland &amp; Scholes, 1999, p. 19) and so how they view the situation would impact their work and success.
* Transformation process – Change, in one word, is the centre of the transformation system; the process of the transformation is more important for the business solution system. This is because the change is what the industry 5.0 sustainability system intends. The purpose behind the transformation system where change is applied holds value. For example, when converting grapes into wine the purpose for Change is to supply to grape consumers more value of the grape (product), thus sustaining the product value systemically. What is the transformation that lies at the heart of the system - transforming grapes into wine, transforming unsold goods into sold goods, transforming a societal need into a societal need met? This means change, in one word, is the centre of the transformation system; the process of becoming is more important than the business solution system. This is because the change is what the industry 2.0 systemic sustainability system practice purpose solves. The purpose behind the transformation system where change is provides the change, thus the results. For example when converting grapes into wine the purpose for Change is to supply to members of the public interest or involvement in grapes more value of the product, thus sustaining the product value more systemically.
* Weltanschauung (or Worldview) – What is the big picture and what are the wider impacts of the issue? &quot;The word Weltanschauung is a German word that has no real English equivalent. It refers to &quot;all the things that you take for granted&quot; and is related to our values&quot;. But the closest translation would be &quot;world view&quot;, which is the collective summary of the stakeholders belief that gives meaning to the root definition. Model of the human activity system as a whole.
* Owner – Who owns the process or situation being investigated and what role will they play in the solution?
* Environmental constraints – What are the constraints and limitations that will impact the solution and its success?

CATWOE can also be related to the holistic multi-benefit analysis due to the multiple perspectives that are taken into consideration. It further understands the perspectives and concerns of different stakeholders involved in the human activity systems adhering to the core values of soft systems thinking allowing multiple perspectives to be appreciated with good knowledge management

==Human activity system==

A human activity system can be defined as &quot;notional system (i.e. not existing in any tangible form) where human beings are undertaking some activities that achieve some purpose&quot;.

Within most systems there will be many human activity systems integrated within it to form the whole system. Human activity systems can be used in SSM to establish worldviews (Weltanschauung) for people involved in problematic situations. The assumption with all human activity systems is that all actors within them will act accordingly with their own worldviews.

<text>The Soviet, later Russian IDA71 military and naval rebreather is an oxygen rebreather intended for use by naval and military divers including Russian commando frogmen. As supplied it is in a plain backpack harness with no buoyancy aid. The casing is pressed aluminium with a hinged cover. It has a small optional nitrox cylinder which can be clipped on its outside to convert it to nitrox mode. It contains one oxygen cylinder and two absorbent canisters. In the bottom of its casing is an empty space which is intended for an underwater communications set.

Here, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;back&quot;, etc. refer to a man wearing the set standing on land.

The casing is thinner towards the lower end, to reduce drag.

On the front of the harness of the navy frogman version there is a projecting metal plate intended to carry a limpet mine. The front of the harness is a tough rubber &quot;apron&quot;.

The loop of each breathing tube can be strapped down to the shoulder to keep it under control to stop it from catching on things or being easily grabbed from behind.

On each side of the casing is a small clip to fasten a parachute to.

==Operating modes==
The IDA-71 can be used as an oxygen rebreather, or with the addition of an external cylinder, as a nitrox rebreather, which converts between nitrox and oxygen automatically by a pressure activated valve on the nitrox attachment.

It can run as an ordinary diving rebreather. Or it can be run with one of its two absorbent canisters filled with potassium superoxide, which gives off oxygen as it absorbs carbon dioxide: 4KO2 + 2CO2 = 2K2CO3 + 3O2; in this mode the oxygen cylinder is a bailout, or to fill and flush the circuit at the start of the dive. This mode gives the set more duration underwater, but is dangerous and not to be risked by civilians because of the explosively hot reaction that happens if water gets on the potassium superoxide; whereas ordinary modern diver&#x27;s rebreather absorbents have been designed to avoid producing a caustic solution (commonly called &quot;cocktail&quot;) if they get wet. Tests at the United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit in Panama City, Florida showed that the IDA71 could give significantly longer dive time with superoxide in one of the canisters than without.

For many years the IDA71 and similar have been a standard Russian frogman&#x27;s and naval work diver&#x27;s breathing set. The &quot;71&quot; in its name may be the year that it was designed, like with the numbers in the names of the AK series of Russian rifles. The name IDA comes from (translit. izoliruyushchiy dykhatel&#x27;nyy apparat, literally &quot;Insulating/Isolating Breathing Apparatus&quot;). Other name is &quot;Individual Breathing Apparatus&quot; (, translit. Individualniy Dykhatelniy Apparat).

In its original Russian mode as an oxygen rebreather, its dive duration is said to be 4 hours. Filling both canisters with soda lime and putting a second oxygen cylinder in the empty space at the bottom, might increase its dive duration to 8 hours.

A number of IDA71&#x27;s have found their way out of the ex-USSR to Europe and America, where recreational divers have added a wing buoyancy compensator and converted them into manually controlled closed circuit rebreathers.

<doc id="1102000" wikidata="Q270085" url="?curid=1102000" title="Shen Kuo">
<text>Shen Kuo (; 1031–1095) or Shen Gua, courtesy name Cunzhong (存中) and pseudonym Mengqi (now usually given as Mengxi) Weng (夢溪翁), was a Chinese polymath, scientist, and statesman of the Song dynasty (960–1279). Shen was a master in many fields of study including mathematics, optics, and horology. In his career as a civil servant, he became a finance minister, governmental state inspector, head official for the Bureau of Astronomy in the Song court, Assistant Minister of Imperial Hospitality, and also served as an academic chancellor. At court his political allegiance was to the Reformist faction known as the New Policies Group, headed by Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1085).

In his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; or &quot;Dream Torrent Essays&quot; (; &quot;Mengxi Bitan&quot;) of 1088, Shen was the first to describe the magnetic needle compass, which would be used for navigation (first described in Europe by Alexander Neckam in 1187). Shen discovered the concept of true north in terms of magnetic declination towards the north pole, with experimentation of suspended magnetic needles and &quot;the improved meridian determined by Shen&#x27;s [astronomical] measurement of the distance between the pole star and true north&quot;. This was the decisive step in human history to make compasses more useful for navigation, and may have been a concept unknown in Europe for another four hundred years (evidence of German sundials made circa 1450 show markings similar to Chinese geomancers&#x27; compasses in regard to declination).

Alongside his colleague Wei Pu, Shen planned to map the orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented a new type of inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although not the first to invent camera obscura, Shen noted the relation of the focal point of a concave mirror and that of the pinhole. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism he unearthed as an amateur archaeologist proved to be a Jacob&#x27;s staff, a surveying tool which wasn&#x27;t known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.

Shen Kuo wrote several other books besides the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, yet much of the writing in his other books has not survived. Some of Shen&#x27;s poetry was preserved in posthumous written works. Although much of his focus was on technical and scientific issues, he had an interest in divination and the supernatural, the latter including his vivid description of unidentified flying objects from eyewitness testimony. He also wrote commentary on ancient Daoist and Confucian texts.

== Life ==
=== Birth and youth ===

Shen Kuo was born in Qiantang (modern-day Hangzhou) in the year 1031. His father Shen Zhou (; 978–1052) was a somewhat lower-class gentry figure serving in official posts on the provincial level; his mother was from a family of equal status in Suzhou, with her maiden name being Xu (). Shen Kuo received his initial childhood education from his mother, which was a common practice in China during this period. She was very educated herself, teaching Kuo and his brother Pi () the military doctrines of her own elder brother Xu Dong (; 975–1016). Since Shen was unable to boast of a prominent familial clan history like many of his elite peers born in the north, he was forced to rely on his wit and stern determination to achieve in his studies, subsequently passing the imperial examinations and enter the challenging and sophisticated life of an exam-drafted state bureaucrat.

From about 1040 AD, Shen&#x27;s family moved around Sichuan province and finally to the international seaport at Xiamen, where Shen&#x27;s father accepted minor provincial posts in each new location. Shen Zhou also served several years in the prestigious capital judiciary, the equivalent of a national supreme court. Shen Kuo took notice of the various towns and rural features of China as his family traveled, while he became interested during his youth in the diverse topography of the land. He also observed the intriguing aspects of his father&#x27;s engagement in administrative governance and the managerial problems involved; these experiences had a deep impact on him as he later became a government official. Since he often became ill as a child, Shen Kuo also developed a natural curiosity about medicine and pharmaceutics.

Shen Zhou died in the late winter of 1051 (or early 1052), when his son Shen Kuo was 21 years old. Shen Kuo grieved for his father, and following Confucian ethics, remained inactive in a state of mourning for three years until 1054 (or early 1055). As of 1054, Shen began serving in minor local governmental posts. However, his natural abilities to plan, organize, and design were proven early in life; one example is his design and supervision of the hydraulic drainage of an embankment system, which converted some one hundred thousand acres (400 km2) of swampland into prime farmland. Shen Kuo noted that the success of the silt fertilization method relied upon the effective operation of sluice gates of irrigation canals.

=== Official career ===

In 1063 Shen Kuo successfully passed the imperial examinations, the difficult national-level standard test that every high official was required to pass in order to enter the governmental system. He not only passed the exam however, but was placed into the higher category of the best and brightest students. While serving at Yangzhou, Shen&#x27;s brilliance and dutiful character caught the attention of Zhang Chu (; 1015–1080), the Fiscal Intendant of the region. Shen made a lasting impression upon Zhang, who recommended Shen for a court appointment in the financial administration of the central court. Shen would also eventually marry Zhang&#x27;s daughter, who became his second wife.

In his career as a scholar-official for the central government, Shen Kuo was also an ambassador to the Western Xia dynasty and Liao dynasty, a military commander, a director of hydraulic works, and the leading chancellor of the Hanlin Academy. By 1072, Shen was appointed as the head official of the Bureau of Astronomy. With his leadership position in the bureau, Shen was responsible for projects in improving calendrical science, and proposed many reforms to the Chinese calendar alongside the work of his colleague Wei Pu. With his impressive skills and aptitude for matters of economy and finance, Shen was appointed as the Finance Commissioner at the central court.

As written by Li Zhiyi, a man married to Hu Wenrou (granddaughter of Hu Su, a famous minister of the Song dynasty), Shen Kuo was Li&#x27;s mentor while Shen served as an official. According to Li&#x27;s epitaph for his wife, Shen would sometimes relay questions via Li to Hu when he needed clarification for his mathematical work, as Hu Wenrou was esteemed by Shen as a remarkable female mathematician. Shen lamented: &quot;If only she were a man, Wenrou would be my friend.&quot;

While employed by the central government, Shen Kuo was also sent out with others to inspect the granary system of the empire, investigating problems of illegal tax-collection, negligence, ineffective disaster relief, and inadequate water-conservancy projects. While Shen was appointed as the regional inspector of Zhejiang in 1073, the Emperor requested that Shen pay a visit to the famous poet Su Shi (1037–1101), then an administrator in Hangzhou. Shen took advantage of this meeting to copy some of Su&#x27;s poetry, which he presented to the Emperor indicating that it expressed &quot;abusive and hateful&quot; speech against the Song court; these poems were later politicized by Li Ding and Shu Dan in order to level a court case against Su. (The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, of 1079.) With his demonstrations of loyalty and ability, Shen Kuo was awarded the honorary title of a State Foundation Viscount by Emperor Shenzong of Song (r. 1067–1085), who placed a great amount of trust in Shen Kuo. He was even made &#x27;companion to the heir apparent&#x27; (太子中允; &#x27;Taizi zhongyun&#x27;).
At court Shen was a political favorite of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (1021–1086), who was the leader of the political faction of Reformers, also known as the New Policies Group (, Xin Fa). Shen Kuo had a previous history with Wang Anshi, since it was Wang who had composed the funerary epitaph for Shen&#x27;s father, Zhou. Shen Kuo soon impressed Wang Anshi with his skills and abilities as an administrator and government agent. In 1072, Shen was sent to supervise Wang&#x27;s program of surveying the building of silt deposits in the Bian Canal outside the capital city. Using an original technique, Shen successfully dredged the canal and demonstrated the formidable value of the silt gathered as a fertilizer. He gained further reputation at court once he was dispatched as an envoy to the Khitan Liao dynasty in the summer of 1075. The Khitans had made several aggressive negotiations of pushing their borders south, while manipulating several incompetent Song ambassadors who conceded to the Liao Kingdom&#x27;s demands. In a brilliant display of diplomacy, Shen Kuo came to the camp of the Khitan monarch at Mt. Yongan (near modern Pingquan, Hebei), armed with copies of previously archived diplomatic negotiations between the Song and Liao dynasties. Shen Kuo refuted Emperor Daozong&#x27;s bluffs point for point, while the Song reestablished their rightful border line. In regard to the Lý dynasty of Đại Việt (in modern northern Vietnam), Shen demonstrated in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; that he was familiar with the key players (on the Vietnamese side) in the prelude to the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1075–1077. With his reputable achievements, Shen became a trusted member of Wang Anshi&#x27;s elite circle of eighteen unofficial core political loyalists to the New Policies Group.
Although much of Wang Anshi&#x27;s reforms outlined in the New Policies centered on state finance, land tax reform, and the Imperial examinations, there were also military concerns. This included policies of raising militias to lessen the expense of upholding a million soldiers, putting government monopolies on saltpetre and sulphur production and distribution in 1076 (to ensure that gunpowder solutions would not fall into the hands of enemies), and aggressive military policy towards Song&#x27;s northern rivals of the Western Xia and Liao dynasties. A few years after Song dynasty military forces had made victorious territorial gains against the Tanguts of the Western Xia, in 1080 Shen Kuo was entrusted as a military officer in defense of Yanzhou (modern-day Yan&#x27;an, Shaanxi province). During the autumn months of 1081, Shen was successful in defending Song dynasty territory while capturing several fortified towns of the Western Xia. The Emperor Shenzong of Song rewarded Shen with numerous titles for his merit in these battles, and in the sixteen months of Shen&#x27;s military campaign, he received 273 letters from the Emperor. However, Emperor Shenzong trusted an arrogant military officer who disobeyed the emperor and Shen&#x27;s proposal for strategic fortifications, instead fortifying what Shen considered useless strategic locations. Furthermore, this officer expelled Shen from his commanding post at the main citadel, so as to deny him any glory in chance of victory. The result of this was nearly catastrophic, as the forces of the arrogant officer were decimated; Xinzhong Yao states that the death toll was 60,000. Nonetheless, Shen was successful in defending his fortifications and the only possible Tangut invasion-route to Yanzhou.

=== Impeachment and later life ===

The new Chancellor Cai Que (; 1036–1093) held Shen responsible for the disaster and loss of life. Along with abandoning the territory which Shen Kuo had fought for, Cai ousted Shen from his seat of office. Shen&#x27;s life was now forever changed, as he lost his once reputable career in state governance and the military. Shen was then put under probation in a fixed residence for the next six years. However, as he was isolated from governance, he decided to pick up the ink brush and dedicate himself to intensive scholarly studies. After completing two geographical atlases for a state-sponsored program, Shen was rewarded by having his sentence of probation lifted, allowing him to live in a place of his choice. Shen was also pardoned by the court for any previous faults or crimes that were claimed against him.

In his more idle years removed from court affairs, Shen Kuo enjoyed pastimes of the Chinese gentry and literati that would indicate his intellectual level and cultural taste to others. As described in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, Shen Kuo enjoyed the company of the &quot;nine guests&quot; (九客, &quot;jiuke&quot;), a figure of speech for the Chinese zither, the older 17x17 line variant of weiqi (known today as go), Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. These nine activities were an extension to the older so-called Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar.

In the 1070s, Shen had purchased a lavish garden estate on the outskirts of modern-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu province, a place of great beauty which he named &quot;Dream Brook&quot; (&quot;Mengxi&quot;) after he visited it for the first time in 1086. Shen Kuo permanently moved to the Dream Brook Estate in 1088, and in that same year he completed his life&#x27;s written work of the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, naming the book after his garden-estate property. It was there that Shen Kuo spent the last several years of his life in leisure, isolation, and illness, until his death in 1095.

== Scholarly achievements ==

Shen Kuo wrote extensively on a wide range of different subjects. His written work included two geographical atlases, a treatise on music with mathematical harmonics, governmental administration, mathematical astronomy, astronomical instruments, martial defensive tactics and fortifications, painting, tea, medicine, and much poetry. His scientific writings have been praised by sinologists such as Joseph Needham and Nathan Sivin, and he has been compared by Sivin to polymaths such as his Song dynasty Chinese contemporary Su Song, as well as to Gottfried Leibniz and Mikhail Lomonosov.

=== Raised-relief map ===

Joseph Needham suggests that certain pottery vessels of the Han dynasty (202 BC – 220 AD) showing artificial mountains as lid decorations may have influenced the development of the raised-relief map in China. The Han dynasty general Ma Yuan (14 BC – 49 AD) is recorded as having made a raised-relief map of valleys and mountains in a rice-constructed model of 32 AD. Shen Kuo&#x27;s largest atlas included twenty three maps of China and foreign regions that were drawn at a uniform scale of 1:900,000. Shen also created a raised-relief map using sawdust, wood, beeswax, and wheat paste. Zhu Xi (1130–1200) was inspired by the raised-relief map of Huang Shang and so made his own portable map made of wood and clay which could be folded up from eight hinged pieces.

=== Pharmacology ===

For pharmacology, Shen wrote of the difficulties of adequate diagnosis and therapy, as well as the proper selection, preparation, and administration of drugs. He held great concern for detail and philological accuracy in identification, use and cultivation of different types of medicinal herbs, such as in which months medicinal plants should be gathered, their exact ripening times, which parts should be used for therapy; for domesticated herbs he wrote about planting times, fertilization, and other matters of horticulture. In the realms of botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Shen Kuo documented and systematically described hundreds of different plants, agricultural crops, rare vegetation, animals, and minerals found in China. For example, Shen noted that the mineral orpiment was used to quickly erase writing errors on paper.

=== Civil engineering ===
The writing of Shen Kuo is the only source for the date when the drydock was first used in China. Shen Kuo wrote that during the Xi-Ning reign (1068–1077), the court official Huang Huaixin devised a plan for repairing 60 m (200 ft) long palatial boats that were a century old; essentially, Huang Huaixin devised the first Chinese drydock for suspending boats out of water. These boats were then placed in a roof-covered dock warehouse to protect them from weathering. Shen also wrote about the effectiveness of the new invention (i.e. by the 10th century engineer Qiao Weiyo) of the pound lock to replace the old flash lock design used in canals. He wrote that it saved the work of five hundred annual labors, annual costs of up to 1,250,000 strings of cash, and increased the size limit of boats accommodated from 21 tons/21000 kg to 113 tons/115000 kg.

If it were not for Shen Kuo&#x27;s analysis and quoting in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; of the writings of the architect Yu Hao (fl. 970), the latter&#x27;s work would have been lost to history. Yu designed a famous wooden pagoda that burned down in 1044 and was replaced in 1049 by a brick pagoda (the &#x27;Iron Pagoda&#x27;) of similar height, but not of his design. From Shen&#x27;s quotation—or perhaps Shen&#x27;s own paraphrasing of Yu Hao&#x27;s &quot;Timberwork Manual&quot; (木經; &quot;Mujing&quot;)—shows that already in the 10th century there was a graded system of building unit proportions, a system which Shen states had become more precise in his time but stating no one could possibly reproduce such a sound work. However, he did not anticipate the more complex and matured system of unit proportions embodied in the extensive written work by scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110), the &quot;Treatise on Architectural Methods&quot; (營造法式; &quot;Yingzao Fashi&quot;) of 1103. Klaas Ruitenbeek states that the version of the &quot;Timberwork Manual&quot; quoted by Shen is most likely Shen&#x27;s summarization of Yu&#x27;s work or a corrupted passage of the original by Yu Hao, as Shen writes: &quot;According to some, the work was written by Yu Hao.&quot;

=== Anatomy ===
The Chinese had long taken an interest in examining the human body. For example, in 16 AD, the Xin dynasty usurper Wang Mang called for the dissection of an executed man, to examine his arteries and viscera in order to discover cures for illnesses. Shen also took interest in human anatomy, dispelling the long-held Chinese theory that the throat contained three valves, writing, &quot;When liquid and solid are imbibed together, how can it be that in one&#x27;s mouth they sort themselves into two throat channels?&quot; Shen maintained that the larynx was the beginning of a system that distributed vital &quot;qi&quot; from the air throughout the body, and that the esophagus was a simple tube that dropped food into the stomach. Following Shen&#x27;s reasoning and correcting the findings of the dissection of executed bandits in 1045, an early 12th-century Chinese account of a bodily dissection finally supported Shen&#x27;s belief in two throat valves, not three. Also, the later Song dynasty judge and early forensic expert Song Ci (1186–1249) would promote the use of autopsy in order to solve homicide cases, as written in his &quot;Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified&quot;.

=== Mathematics ===

In the broad field of mathematics, Shen Kuo mastered many practical mathematical problems, including many complex formulas for geometry, circle packing, and chords and arcs problems employing trigonometry. Shen addressed problems of writing out very large numbers, as large as (104)43. Shen&#x27;s &quot;technique of small increments&quot; laid the foundation in Chinese mathematics for packing problems involving equal difference series. Sal Restivo writes that Shen used summation of higher series to ascertain the number of kegs which could be piled in layers in a space shaped like the frustum of a rectangular pyramid. In his formula &quot;technique of intersecting circles&quot;, he created an approximation of the arc of a circle &quot;s&quot; given the diameter &quot;d&quot;, sagitta &quot;v&quot;, and length of the chord &quot;c&quot; subtending the arc, the length of which he approximated as &quot;s&quot; = &quot;c&quot; + 2v2/d. Restivo writes that Shen&#x27;s work in the lengths of arcs of circles provided the basis for spherical trigonometry developed in the 13th century by Guo Shoujing (1231–1316). He also simplified the counting rods technique by outlining short cuts in algorithm procedures used on the counting board, an idea expanded on by the mathematician Yang Hui (1238–1298). Victor J. Katz asserts that Shen&#x27;s method of &quot;dividing by 9, increase by 1; dividing by 8, increase by 2,&quot; was a direct forerunner to the rhyme scheme method of repeated addition &quot;9, 1, bottom add 1; 9, 2, bottom add 2&quot;.

Shen wrote extensively about what he had learned while working for the state treasury, including mathematical problems posed by computing land tax, estimating requirements, currency issues, metrology, and so forth. Shen once computed the amount of terrain space required for battle formations in military strategy, and also computed the longest possible military campaign given the limits of human carriers who would bring their own food and food for other soldiers. Shen wrote about the earlier Yi Xing (672–717), a Buddhist monk who applied an early escapement mechanism to a water-powered celestial globe. By using mathematical permutations, Shen described Yi Xing&#x27;s calculation of possible positions on a &quot;go&quot; board game. Shen calculated the total number for this using up to five rows and twenty five game pieces, which yielded the number 847,288,609,443.

=== Optics ===
Shen Kuo experimented with the pinhole camera and burning mirror as the ancient Chinese Mohists had done in the 4th century BC, as Mozi of China&#x27;s Warring States period was perhaps the first to describe the concept of camera obscura, if not his Greek contemporary Aristotle. The Iraqi Muslim scientist Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) further experimented with camera obscura and was the first to attribute geometrical and quantitative properties to it, but Shen was first to note the relationship of the three separate radiation phenomena: the focal point, burning point, and pinhole. Using a fitting metaphor, Shen compared optical image inversion to an oarlock and waisted drum. Along with focal points, he also noted that the image in a concave mirror is inverted. Shen, who never asserted that he was the first to experiment with camera obscura, hints in his writing that camera obscura was dealt with in the &quot;Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang&quot; written by Duan Chengshi (d. 863) during the Tang dynasty (618–907), in regard to the inverted image of a Chinese pagoda by a seashore. Chinese authors from the 12th to 17th centuries would discuss the optical observations made by Shen Kuo but not advance them further, while Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) would be the first in Europe to make a similar observation about the focal point and pinhole in camera obscura.

=== Magnetic needle compass ===

Since the time of the engineer and inventor Ma Jun (c. 200–265), the Chinese had used the south-pointing chariot, which did not employ magnetism, as a compass. In 1044 the &quot;Collection of the Most Important Military Techniques&quot; (; &quot;Wujing Zongyao&quot;) recorded that fish-shaped objects cut from sheet iron, magnetized by (essentially, heating that produced weak magnetic force), and placed in a water-filled bowl enclosed by a box were used for directional pathfinding alongside the south-pointing chariot.
However, it was not until the time of Shen Kuo that the earliest magnetic compasses would be used for navigation. In his written work, Shen Kuo made the first known explicit reference to the magnetic compass-needle and the concept of true north. He wrote that steel needles were magnetized once they were rubbed with lodestone, and that they were put in floating position or in mountings; he described the suspended compass as the best form to be used, and noted that the magnetic needle of compasses pointed either south or north. Shen Kuo asserted that the needle will point south but with a deviation, stating &quot;[the magnetic needles] are always displaced slightly east rather than pointing due south.&quot;

Shen Kuo wrote that it was preferable to use the twenty-four-point rose instead of the old eight compass cardinal points — and the former was recorded in use for navigation shortly after Shen&#x27;s death. The preference of use for the twenty-four-point-rose compass may have arisen from Shen&#x27;s finding of a more accurate astronomical meridian, determined by his measurement between the pole star and true north; however, it could also have been inspired by geomantic beliefs and practices. The book of the author Zhu Yu, the &quot;Pingzhou Table Talks&quot; published in 1119 (written from 1111 to 1117), was the first record of use of a compass for seafaring navigation. However, Zhu Yu&#x27;s book recounts events back to 1086, when Shen Kuo was writing the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;; this meant that in Shen&#x27;s time the compass might have already been in navigational use. In any case, Shen Kuo&#x27;s writing on magnetic compasses has proved invaluable for understanding China&#x27;s earliest use of the compass for seafaring navigation.

=== Archaeology ===
Many of Shen Kuo&#x27;s contemporaries were interested in antiquarian pursuits of collecting old artworks. They were also interested in archaeological pursuits, although for rather different reasons than why Shen Kuo held an interest in archaeology. While Shen&#x27;s educated Confucian contemporaries were interested in obtaining ancient relics and antiques in order to revive their use in rituals, Shen was more concerned with how items from archeological finds were originally manufactured and what their functionality would have been, based on empirical evidence. Shen Kuo criticized those in his day who reconstructed ancient ritual objects using only their imagination and not the tangible evidence from archeological digs or finds. Shen also disdained the notion of others that these objects were products of the &quot;sages&quot; or the aristocratic class of antiquity, rightfully crediting the items&#x27; manufacture and production to the common working people and artisans of previous eras. Some author writes that Shen Kuo &quot;advocated the use of an interdisciplinary approach to archaeology and practiced such an approach himself through his work in metallurgy, optics, and geometry in the study of ancient measures.&quot;

While working in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo&#x27;s interest in archaeology and old relics led him to reconstruct an armillary sphere from existing models as well as from ancient texts that could provide additional information. Shen used ancient mirrors while conducting his optics experiments. He observed ancient weaponry, describing the scaled sight devices on ancient crossbows and the ancients&#x27; production of swords with composite blades that had a midrib of wrought iron and low-carbon steel while having two sharp edges of high-carbon steel. Being a knowledgeable musician, Shen also suggested suspending an ancient bell by using a hollow handle. In his assessment of the carved reliefs of the ancient Zhuwei Tomb, Shen stated that the reliefs demonstrate genuine Han dynasty era clothing.

After unearthing an ancient crossbow device from a house&#x27;s garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen discovered that the cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, could be used to calculate the height of a distant mountain in the same way that mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob&#x27;s staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device&#x27;s cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer&#x27;s eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.

=== Geology ===

The ancient Greek Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC) wrote in his &quot;Meteorology&quot; of how the earth had the potential for physical change, including the belief that all rivers and seas at one time did not exist where they were, and were dry. The Greek writer Xenophanes (570 BC–480 BC) wrote of how inland marine fossils were evidence that massive periodic flooding had wiped out mankind several times in the past, but never wrote of land formation or shifting seashores. Du Yu (222–285) a Chinese Jin dynasty officer, believed that the land of hills would eventually be leveled into valleys and valleys would gradually rise to form hills. The Daoist alchemist Ge Hong (284–364) wrote of the legendary immortal Magu; in a written dialogue by Ge, Ma Gu described how what was once the Eastern Sea (i.e. East China Sea) had transformed into solid land where mulberry trees grew, and would one day be filled with mountains and dry, dusty lands. The later Persian Muslim scholar Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī (973–1048) hypothesized that India was once covered by the Indian Ocean while observing rock formations at the mouths of rivers.

It was Shen Kuo who formulated a hypothesis about the process of land formation (geomorphology) based upon several observations as evidence. This included his observation of fossil shells in a geological stratum of a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean. He inferred that the land was reshaped and formed by erosion of the mountains, uplift, and the deposition of silt, after observing strange natural erosions of the Taihang Mountains and the Yandang Mountain near Wenzhou. He hypothesized that, with the inundation of silt, the land of the continent must have been formed over an enormous span of time. While visiting the Taihang Mountains in 1074, Shen Kuo noticed strata of bivalve shells and ovoid rocks in a horizontal-running span through a cliff like a large belt. Shen proposed that the cliff was once the location of an ancient seashore that by his time had shifted hundreds of miles east. Shen wrote that in the Zhiping reign period (1064–1067) a man of Zezhou unearthed an object in his garden that looked like a serpent or dragon, and after examining it, concluded the dead animal had apparently turned to &quot;stone&quot;. The magistrate of Jincheng, Zheng Boshun, examined the creature as well, and noted the same scale-like markings that were seen on other marine animals. Shen Kuo likened this to the &quot;stone crabs&quot; found in China.

Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground in a climatic area where they had never been known to be grown, the climate there must have shifted geographically over time. Around the year 1080, Shen Kuo noted that a landslide on the bank of a large river near Yanzhou (modern Yan&#x27;an) had revealed an open space several dozens of feet under the ground once the bank collapsed. This underground space contained hundreds of petrified bamboos still intact with roots and trunks, &quot;all turned to stone&quot; as Shen Kuo wrote. Shen Kuo noted that bamboos do not grow in Yanzhou, located in northern China, and he was puzzled during which previous dynasty the bamboos could have grown. Considering that damp and gloomy low places provide suitable conditions for the growth of bamboo, Shen deduced that the climate of Yanzhou must have fit that description in very ancient times. Although this would have intrigued many of his readers, the study of paleoclimatology in medieval China did not develop into an established discipline.

The Song dynasty philosopher Zhu Xi (1130–1200) wrote of this curious natural phenomenon of fossils as well. He was known to have read the works of Shen Kuo. Shen&#x27;s description of soil erosion and weathering predated that of Georgius Agricola in his book of 1546, &quot;De veteribus et novis metallis&quot;. Furthermore, Shen&#x27;s theory of sedimentary deposition predated that of James Hutton, whose groundbreaking work was published in 1802 (considered the foundation of modern geology). Historian Joseph Needham likened Shen&#x27;s account to that of the Scottish scientist Roderick Murchison (1792–1871), who was inspired to become a geologist after observing a providential landslide.

=== Meteorology ===

Early speculation and hypothesis pertaining to what is now known as meteorology had a long tradition in China before Shen Kuo. For example, the Han dynasty scholar Wang Chong (27–97) accurately described the process of the water cycle. However, Shen made some observations that were not found elsewhere in Chinese literature. For instance, Shen was the first in East Asia to describe tornadoes, which were thought to exist only in the Western hemisphere until their observation in China during the first decade of the 20th century.

Shen gave reasoning (earlier proposed by Sun Sikong, 1015–1076) that rainbows were formed by the shadow of the sun in rain, occurring when the sun would shine upon it. Paul Dong writes that Shen&#x27;s explanation of the rainbow as a phenomenon of atmospheric refraction &quot;is basically in accord with modern scientific principles.&quot; In Europe, Roger Bacon (1214–1294) was the first to suggest that the colors of the rainbow were caused by the reflection and refraction of sunlight through rain drops.

Shen hypothesized that rays of sunlight refract before reaching the surface of the earth, hence people on earth observing the sun are not viewing it in its exact position, in other words, the altitude of the apparent sun is higher than the actual altitude of the sun. Dong writes that &quot;at the time, this discovery was remarkably original.&quot; Ibn al-Haytham, in his &quot;Book of Optics&quot; (1021), also discussed atmospheric refraction in regard to twilight.

=== Astronomy and instruments ===
Being the head official for the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo was an avid scholar of medieval astronomy, and improved the designs of several astronomical instruments. Shen is credited with making improved designs of the gnomon, armillary sphere, and clepsydra clock. For the clepsydra he designed a new overflow-tank type, and argued for a more efficient higher-order interpolation instead of linear interpolation in calibrating the measure of time. Improving the 5th century model of the astronomical sighting tube, Shen Kuo widened its diameter so that the new calibration could observe the pole star indefinitely. This came about due to the position of the pole star shifting in position since the time of Zu Geng in the 5th century, hence Shen Kuo diligently observed the course of the pole star for three months, plotting the data of its course and coming to the conclusion that it had shifted slightly over three degrees. Apparently this astronomical finding had an impact upon the intellectual community in China at the time. Even Shen&#x27;s political rival and contemporary astronomer Su Song featured Shen&#x27;s corrected position of the pole star (halfway between Tian shu, at −350 degrees, and the current Polaris) in the fourth star map of his celestial atlas.

The astronomical phenomena of the solar eclipse and lunar eclipse had been observed in the 4th century BC by astronomers Gan De and Shi Shen; the latter gave instructions on predicting the eclipses based on the relative position of the Moon to the Sun. The philosopher Wang Chong argued against the &#x27;radiating influence&#x27; theory of Jing Fang&#x27;s writing in the 1st century BC and that of Zhang Heng (78–139); the latter two correctly hypothesized that the brightness of the Moon was merely light reflected from the Sun. Jing Fang had written in the 1st century BC of how it was long accepted in China that the Sun and Moon were spherical in shape (&#x27;like a crossbow bullet&#x27;), not flat. Shen Kuo also wrote of solar and lunar eclipses in this manner, yet expanded upon this to explain why the celestial bodies were spherical, going against the &#x27;flat earth&#x27; theory for celestial bodies. However, there is no evidence to suggest that Shen Kuo supported a round earth theory, which was introduced into Chinese science by Matteo Ricci and Xu Guangqi in the 17th century. When the Director of the Astronomical Observatory asked Shen Kuo if the shapes of the Sun and Moon were round like balls or flat like fans, Shen Kuo explained that celestial bodies were spherical because of knowledge of waxing and waning of the Moon. Much like what Zhang Heng had said, Shen Kuo likened the Moon to a ball of silver, which does not produce light, but simply reflects light if provided from another source (the Sun). He explained that when the Sun&#x27;s light is slanting, the Moon appears full. He then explained if one were to cover any sort of sphere with white powder, and then viewed from the side it would appear to be a crescent, hence he reasoned that celestial bodies were spherical. He also wrote that, although the Sun and Moon were in conjunction and opposition with each other once a month, this did not mean the Sun would be eclipsed every time their paths met, because of the small obliquity of their orbital paths.
Shen is also known for his cosmological hypotheses in explaining the variations of planetary motions, including retrogradation. His colleague Wei Pu realized that the old calculation technique for the mean Sun was inaccurate compared to the apparent Sun, since the latter was ahead of it in the accelerated phase of motion, and behind it in the retarded phase. Shen&#x27;s hypotheses were similar to the concept of the epicycle in the Greco-Roman tradition, only Shen compared the side-section of orbital paths of planets and variations of planetary speeds to points in the tips of a willow leaf. In a similar rudimentary physical analogy of celestial motions, as John B. Henderson describes it, Shen likened the relationship of the Moon&#x27;s path to the ecliptic, the path of the Sun, &quot;to the figure of a rope coiled about a tree.&quot;

Along with his colleague Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations three times a night for a continuum of five years. The Song astronomers of Shen&#x27;s day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved into a state of considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times a night for what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed to Wei and Shen&#x27;s work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen&#x27;s tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.

=== Movable type printing ===
Shen Kuo wrote that during the Qingli reign period (1041–1048), under Emperor Renzong of Song (1022–1063), an obscure commoner and artisan known as Bi Sheng (990–1051) invented ceramic movable type printing. Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose a piece of text had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng&#x27;s methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, but if one desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient. Beyond Shen Kuo&#x27;s writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng&#x27;s life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime. Although the details of Bi Sheng&#x27;s life were scarcely known, Shen Kuo wrote:
When Bi Sheng died, his fount of type passed into the possession of my followers (i.e. one of Shen&#x27;s nephews), among whom it has been kept as a precious possession until now.
There are a few surviving examples of books printed in the late Song dynasty using movable type printing. This includes Zhou Bida&#x27;s &quot;Notes of The Jade Hall&quot; () printed in 1193 using the method of baked-clay movable type characters outlined in the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;. Yao Shu (1201–1278), an advisor to Kublai Khan, once persuaded a disciple Yang Gu to print philological primers and Neo-Confucian texts by using what he termed the &quot;movable type of Shen Kuo&quot;. Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333), who wrote the valuable agricultural, scientific, and technological treatise of the &quot;Nong Shu&quot;, mentioned an alternative method of baking earthenware type with earthenware frames in order to make whole blocks. Wang Zhen also improved its use by inventing wooden movable type in the years 1297 or 1298, while he was a magistrate of Jingde, Anhui province. The earlier Bi Sheng had experimented with wooden movable type, but Wang&#x27;s main contribution was improving the speed of typesetting with simple mechanical devices, along with the complex, systematic arrangement of wooden movable type involving the use of revolving tables. Although later metal movable type would be used in China, Wang Zhen experimented with tin metal movable type, but found its use to be inefficient.

By the 15th century, metal movable type printing was developed in Ming dynasty China (and earlier in Goryeo Korea, by the mid 13th century), and was widely applied in China by at least the 16th century. In Jiangsu and Fujian, wealthy Ming era families sponsored the use of metal type printing (mostly using bronze). This included the printing works of Hua Sui (1439–1513), who pioneered the first Chinese bronze-type movable printing in the year 1490. In 1718, during the mid Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the scholar of Tai&#x27;an known as Xu Zhiding developed movable type with enamelware instead of earthenware. There was also Zhai Jinsheng (b. 1784), a teacher of Jingxian, Anhui, who spent thirty years making a font of earthenware movable type, and by 1844 he had over 100,000 Chinese writing characters in five sizes.

Despite these advances, movable type printing never gained the amount of widespread use in East Asia that woodblock printing had achieved since the Chinese Tang dynasty in the 9th century. With written Chinese, the vast amount of written morpheme characters impeded movable type&#x27;s acceptance and practical use, and was therefore seen as largely unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the European printing press, first invented by Johannes Gutenberg (1398–1468), was eventually wholly adopted as the standard in China, yet the tradition of woodblock printing remains popular in East Asian countries.

=== Other achievements in science and technology ===
Shen Kuo described the phenomena of natural predator insects controlling the population of pests, the latter of which had the potential to wreak havoc upon the agricultural base of China.

Shen also wrote about advancements in metallurgy. While visiting the iron-producing district at Cizhou in 1075, Shen described the &quot;partial decarburization&quot; method of reforging cast iron under a cold blast, which Hartwell, Needham, and Wertime state is the predecessor of the Bessemer process. Shen was worried about deforestation due to the needs of the iron industry and ink makers using pine soot in the production process, so he suggested for the latter an alternative of petroleum, which he believed was &quot;produced inexhaustibly within the earth&quot;. Shen used the soot from the smoke of burned petroleum fuel (石油 &quot;Shíyóu&quot;, &quot;rock oil&quot; as Shen called it) to invent a new, more durable type of writing ink; the Ming dynasty pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518–1593) wrote that Shen&#x27;s ink was &quot;lustrous like lacquer, and superior to that made from pinewood lamp-black,&quot; or the soot from pinewood.

=== Beliefs and philosophy ===
Shen Kuo was much in favor of philosophical Daoist notions which challenged the authority of empirical science in his day. Although much could be discerned through empirical observation and recorded study, Daoism asserted that the secrets of the universe were boundless, something that scientific investigation could merely express in fragments and partial understandings. Shen Kuo referred to the ancient Daoist &quot;I Ching&quot; in explaining the spiritual processes and attainment of foreknowledge that cannot be attained through &quot;crude traces&quot;, which he likens to mathematical astronomy. Nathan Sivin proposes that Shen was the first in history to &quot;make a clear distinction between our unconnected experiences and the unitary causal world we postulate to explain them,&quot; which Biderman and Scharfstein state is arguably inherent in the works of Heraclitus, Plato, and Democritus as well. Shen was a firm believer in destiny and prognostication, and made rational explanations for the relations between them. Shen held a special interest in fate, mystical divination, bizarre phenomena, yet warned against the tendency to believe that all matters in life were preordained. When describing an event where lightning had struck a house and all the wooden walls did not burn (but simply turned black) and lacquerwares inside were fine, yet metal objects had melted into liquid, Shen Kuo wrote:

Most people can only judge of things by the experiences of ordinary life, but phenomena outside the scope of this are really quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.

In his commentary on the ancient Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen wrote of the importance of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one&#x27;s inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen&#x27;s life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his commentary on the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.

In the &quot;Strange Happenings&quot; passage of the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, Shen offered accounts of an unidentified flying object that occurred during the reign of Emperor Renzong (1022–1063). An object as bright as a pearl was said to occasionally hover over the city of Yangzhou at night, and was previously described by local inhabitants of eastern Anhui and then in Jiangsu. A man near Xingkai Lake observed the same object, alleging that it emitted powerful lights from its interior like sunbeams illuminating the woods over a ten-mile radius before departing at tremendous speeds. Shen recorded that Yibo, a poet of Gaoyou, wrote a poem about this &quot;pearl&quot; after witnessing it and that locals around Fanliang in Yangzhou erected a &quot;Pearl Pavilion&quot; where spectators on boats hoped to spot the mysterious flying object again.

=== Art criticism ===
As an art critic, Shen criticized the paintings of Li Cheng (919–967) for failing to observe the principle of &quot;seeing the small from the viewpoint of the large&quot; in portraying buildings and the like. He praised the works of Dong Yuan (c. 934–c. 962); he noted that although a close-up view of Dong&#x27;s work would create the impression that his brush techniques were cursory, seen from afar his landscape paintings would give the impression of grand, resplendent, and realistic scenery. In addition, Shen&#x27;s writing on Dong&#x27;s artworks represents the earliest known reference to the Jiangnan style of painting. In his &quot;Song on Painting&quot; and in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;, Shen praised the creative artworks of the Tang painter Wang Wei (701–761); Shen noted that Wang was unique in that he &quot;penetrated into the mysterious reason and depth of creative activity,&quot; but was criticized by others for not conforming his paintings to reality, such as his painting with a banana tree growing in a snowy, wintry landscape.

== Written works ==
Much of Shen Kuo&#x27;s written work was probably purged under the leadership of minister Cai Jing (1046–1126), who revived the New Policies of Wang Anshi, although he set out on a campaign of attrition to destroy or radically alter the written work of his predecessors and especially Conservative enemies. For example, only six of Shen&#x27;s books remain, and four of these have been significantly altered since the time they were penned by the author.

In modern times, the best attempt at a complete list and summary of Shen&#x27;s writing was an appendix written by Hu Daojing in his standard edition of &quot;Brush Talks&quot;, written in 1956.

=== &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; ===
Shen Kuo&#x27;s &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; consists of some 507 separate essays exploring a wide range of subjects. It was Shen&#x27;s ultimate attempt to comprehend and describe a multitude of various aspects of nature, science, and reality, and all the practical and profound curiosities found in the world. The literal translation of the title, &quot;Dream Brook Brush Talks&quot;, refers to his Dream Brook estate, where he spent the last years of his life. About the title, he is quoted as saying: &quot;Because I had only my writing brush and ink slab to converse with, I call it Brush Talks.&quot;

The book was originally 30 chapters long, yet an unknown Chinese author&#x27;s edition of 1166 edited and reorganized the work into 26 chapters.

=== Other written works ===
Although the &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; is certainly his most extensive and important work, Shen Kuo wrote other books as well. In 1075, Shen Kuo wrote the &quot;Xining Fengyuan Li&quot; (; &quot;The Oblatory Epoch astronomical system of the Splendid Peace reign period&quot;), which was lost, but listed in a 7th chapter of a Song dynasty bibliography. This was the official report of Shen Kuo on his reforms of the Chinese calendar, which were only partially adopted by the Song court&#x27;s official calendar system. During his years of retirement from governmental service, Shen Kuo compiled a formulary known as the &quot;Liang Fang&quot; (; &quot;Good medicinal formulas&quot;). Around the year 1126 it was combined with a similar collection by the famous Su Shi (1037–1101), who was ironically a political opponent to Shen Kuo&#x27;s faction of Reformers and New Policies supporters at court, yet it was known that Shen Kuo and Su Shi were nonetheless friends and associates. Shen wrote the &quot;Mengqi Wanghuai Lu&quot; (; &quot;Record of longings forgotten at Dream Brook&quot;), which was also compiled during Shen&#x27;s retirement. This book was a treatise in the working since his youth on rural life and ethnographic accounts of living conditions in the isolated mountain regions of China. Only quotations of it survive in the &quot;Shuo Fu&quot; () collection, which mostly describe the agricultural implements and tools used by rural people in high mountain regions. Shen Kuo also wrote the &quot;Changxing Ji&quot; (; &quot;Collected Literary Works of [the Viscount of] Changxing&quot;). However, this book was without much doubt a posthumous collection, including various poems, prose, and administrative documents written by Shen. By the 15th century (during the Ming dynasty), this book was reprinted, yet only the 19th chapter remained. This chapter was reprinted in 1718, yet poorly edited. Finally, in the 1950s the author Hu Daojing supplemented this small yet valuable work with additions of other scattered poems written by Shen, in the former&#x27;s &quot;Collection of Shen Kua&#x27;s Extant Poetry&quot; (Shanghai: Shang-hai Shu-tian, 1958). In the tradition of the popular Song era literary category of &#x27;travel record literature&#x27; (&#x27;youji wenxue&#x27;), Shen Kuo also wrote the &quot;Register of What Not to Forget&quot;, a traveler&#x27;s guide to what type of carriage is suitable for a journey, the proper foods one should bring, the special clothing one should bring, and many other items.

In his &quot;Sequel to Numerous Things Revealed&quot;, the Song author Cheng Dachang (1123–1195) noted that stanzas prepared by Shen Kuo for military victory celebrations were later written down and published by Shen. This includes a short poem &quot;Song of Triumph&quot; by Shen Kuo, who uses the musical instrument &quot;mawei huqin&quot; (&#x27;horse-tail barbarian stringed instrument&#x27; or &#x27;horse-tail fiddle&#x27;) of the northwestern Inner Asian nomads as a metaphor for prisoners-of-war led by Song troops:

Historian Jonathan Stock notes that the bent bow described in the poem above represents the arched bow used to play the &quot;huqin&quot;, while the sound of the instrument itself represented the discontent expressed by the prisoners-of-war with their defeated khan.

== Legacy ==
=== Praise, critique, and criticism ===
In the &quot;Routledge Curzon Encyclopedia of Confucianism&quot;, Xinzhong Yao states that Shen Kuo&#x27;s legacy was tainted by his eager involvement in Wang Anshi&#x27;s New Policies reforms, his actions criticized in the later traditional histories. However, Shen&#x27;s reputation as a polymath has been well regarded. Joseph Needham stated that Shen Kuo was &quot;one of the greatest scientific minds in Chinese history.&quot; The French sinologist Jacques Gernet is of the opinion that Shen possessed an &quot;amazingly modern mind.&quot; Yao states of Shen&#x27;s thorough recording of natural sciences in his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot;:
We must regard Shen Kuo&#x27;s collection as an indispensable primary source attesting to the unmatched level of attainment achieved by Chinese science prior to the twelfth century.
However, Toby E. Huff writes that Shen Kuo&#x27;s &quot;scattered set&quot; of writings lacks clear-cut organization and &quot;theoretical acuteness,&quot; that is, scientific theory. Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen&#x27;s originality stands &quot;cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities&quot; that provide little insight. Donald Holzman writes that Shen &quot;has nowhere organized his observations into anything like a general theory.&quot; Huff writes that this was a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the &quot;Concordance and Discordant Canons&quot; by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century). In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo &quot;do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant.&quot;

=== Burial and posthumous honors ===
Upon his death, Shen Kuo was interred in a tomb in Yuhang District of Hangzhou, at the foot of the Taiping Hill. His tomb was eventually destroyed, yet Ming dynasty records indicated its location, which was found in 1983 and protected by the government in 1986. The remnants of the tomb&#x27;s brick structure remained, along with Song dynasty glasswares and coins. The Hangzhou Municipal Committee completed a restoration of Shen&#x27;s tomb in September 2001.

In addition to his tomb, Shen Kuo&#x27;s &quot;Mengxi&quot; garden estate, his former two-acre (8,000 m2) property in Zhenjiang, was restored by the government in 1985. However, the renovated Mengxi Garden is only part of the original of Shen Kuo&#x27;s time. A Qing dynasty-era hall built on the site is now used as the main admissions gate. In the Memorial Hall of the gardens, there is a large painting depicting the original garden of Shen Kuo&#x27;s time, including wells, green bamboo groves, stone-paved paths, and decorated walls of the original halls. In this exhibition hall there stands a 1.4 m (4.6 ft) tall statue of Shen Kuo sitting on a platform, along with centuries-old published copies of his &quot;Dream Pool Essays&quot; in glass cabinets, one of which is from Japan. At the garden estate there are also displayed marble banners, statues of Shen Kuo, and a model of an armillary sphere; a small museum gallery depicts Shen&#x27;s various achievements.

The Purple Mountain Observatory in Nanjing discovered a new asteroid in 1964 and named it after Shen Kuo (2027 Shen Guo).

<text>Joseph Riddick &quot;Ricky&quot; Hendrick IV (April 2, 1980 – October 24, 2004) was an American stock car racing driver and partial owner at Hendrick Motorsports, a NASCAR team that his father Rick Hendrick founded. He was born in Charlotte, North Carolina, on April 2, 1980, and began racing in Go Karts at a young age, then the Legends Series at fifteen. He competed in both the Busch Series and Craftsman Truck Series before his death from an airplane accident on October 24, 2004. He was killed with nine other family members and friends during the accident.

==Racing career==
Hendrick began his career in auto racing at the age of 15 by racing in the Legends Series Summer Shootout. He won 5 races in 1995 and 1 in 1996. In 1998, he won three NASCAR Winston Late Model Series races and one in 1999.In 1998, he won three NASCAR Winston Late Model Series races and one in 1999.

Ricky competed in two ARCA Menards Series races, October 4, 2000 at Charlotte Motor Speedway and the 2001 Daytona race in February. 

Hendrick continued to run the series in 2000, with the addition of competing in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series piloting the No. 17 GMAC/Quaker State Chevrolet Silverado. While running races in the No. 24 Busch Series car, he was involved in multiple accidents and suffered from concussions. 

In 2001, he competed in the full NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series races. He recorded his first NASCAR career win at Kansas Speedway on July 7, becoming the youngest Truck Series driver to win a race at that time. Hendrick was also able to accomplish 19 top ten finishes, the most by a rookie at that time. However, at the end of the season, he finished second in the Rookie of the Year Standings, with Travis Kvapil winning the award.

In 2002, he moved to the Busch Series with crew chief Lance McGrew driving the No. 5 GMAC Financial Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Hendrick suffered an accident in the third race of the season at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that resulted in a broken shoulder. He required surgery and missed 3 months of racing before he returned in May and finished 15th at Richmond. Hendrick decided to retire from driving in October of the same year due to mental health and physical concerns. He continued to be employed by Hendrick Motorsports, as the owner of two teams: Brian Vickers and Kyle Busch in the Busch Series. Hendrick also founded a motorcycle dealership in Pineville, North Carolina, named Ricky Hendrick&#x27;s Performance Honda.

==Death==

On October 24, 2004, around 12:30 p.m. EDT, Hendrick died in a plane crash near Martinsville, Virginia, killing him and nine others. The plane, on its way to the Martinsville Speedway for the Subway 500, crashed on Bull Mountain due to pilot error in heavy fog.

Only days after he died, his fiancée Emily Maynard learned that she was pregnant with his child. Maynard gave birth to their daughter, Josephine Riddick &quot;Ricki&quot; Hendrick, on June 29, 2005, naming the girl after her late fiancé.

<doc id="1102009" wikidata="Q156975" url="?curid=1102009" title="Saarland national football team">
<text>The Saarland national football team () was the association football team representing the Saar Protectorate in international football from 1950 to 1956 during the French occupation following World War II. As France opposed the inclusion of the Saarland in the Federal Republic of Germany until 1956, they administered it separately from Germany as the Saar Protectorate.

As the local population did not want to join France, separate organisations were founded. A National Olympic Committee was founded in 1950, leading to an appearance of Saar at the 1952 Summer Olympics. Also, considering themselves not an independent nation different from Germany, the football team was not designated as a &quot;national team&quot;, and was more generally referred to as a &quot;selection&quot; () or some similar term.

==History==
Due to post-war partition, Saarland was separate from both the Federal Republic of Germany (aka West Germany until 1990) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The Saarländischer Fußballbund (SFB) was founded on 25 July 1948 in Sulzbach, with Willy Koch as first chairman. The clubs of the Saarland played in the local Ehrenliga for three seasons from 1948 to 1951, with the exception of the strong 1. FC Saarbrücken club, which played as guests in French Ligue 2 in 1948–49, where they were known as FC Sarrebruck. They easily finished top of the division that season. However, after French clubs voted unanimously against them joining the French Football Federation (resulting in the resignation of president Jules Rimet, who had suggested that Saarbrücken join), the club left the French league. 

Not interested in rejoining the weak Ehrenliga, Saarbrücken established a short-lived invitational tournament in 1949, the Internationaler Saarlandpokal, which attracted a number of top teams, and is regarded as a forerunner to the European Cup. In 1955, Saarbrücken became the sole club representing Saarland in the newborn European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup, winning the first leg in San Siro against the Italian champions AC Milan (3–4), but they were heavily defeated (1–4) and eliminated in the second leg at home by the Lombard opponents. By that time, however, 1.FCS and other leading Saarland clubs had already rejoined the DFB league system, playing in the Oberliga Südwest on a mutual agreement.

On 17 July 1949, the members of the SFB declined a proposal to apply for membership in the French Football Federation by a vote of 609–299 (55 abstentions). Led by new president Hermann Neuberger since 14 May 1950, the SFB became part of FIFA on 12 June 1950, three months before the German Football Association DFB was reinstated, and two years before the East German association was accepted.

The Saarland team was made up largely of footballers from 1. FC Saarbrücken and was buttressed by players from SV Saar 05 Saarbrücken and Borussia Neunkirchen, with occasional representation from clubs including SV St. Ingbert 1945, FC 1912 Ensdorf, and ASC Dudweiler.

The team played only 19 games, 10 of these against &quot;B&quot; squads, but did participate in the 1954 World Cup qualifiers, finishing ahead of Norway in their group by defeating them in Oslo; it was Saarland&#x27;s only win ever against a full senior team. Prior to the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, on 5 June, they hosted a game against defending World Champion Uruguay, losing 1–7. Other &quot;A&quot; team opponents in friendlies were Yugoslavia (1–5), the Netherlands (1–2, 2–3) and Switzerland (1–1).
The only match played outside of Europe was against Uruguay in Montevideo.

Following a referendum in 1955 and the Saar Treaty, Saarland became part of the Federal Republic of Germany with effect on 1 January 1957. The SFB ended its separate FIFA membership and became part of the DFB as the SFV (de: Saarländischer Fußballverband). Coach Helmut Schön, who had managed the Saarland team since 1952, went on to coach the successful Germany national team in the 1960s and 1970s. Hermann Neuberger, a native of the Saarland, proposed the foundation of the Bundesliga in 1962, organized the 1974 FIFA World Cup, and served as president of the DFB from 1975 until his death in 1992.

==FIFA World Cup record==
*1950 – &quot;Did not enter, accepted as FIFA members only two weeks before the tournament&quot;
*1954 – &quot;Did not qualify&quot;

===1954 World Cup qualifying===

The only time that the Saarland entered the World Cup or European Championship qualifiers was for the 1954 World Cup. They were drawn in Group 1 alongside West Germany and Norway, in a triangular series. In the opening round in summer 1953, they won their only competitive away match, beating Norway 3–2 in Oslo after trailing 0–2, and with only 10 effective players, after an early substitute due to injury, and Theodor Puff staying on the field with a broken fibula. Thus they still topped the group after West Germany drew their game in Oslo. Saarland were emphatically beaten 3–0 by West Germany in Stuttgart and could only manage a 0–0 draw at home against Norway. Both German teams were placed joint first until West Germany beat Norway 5–1, putting an end to Norwegian hopes. The remaining inter-German match, to be played after a four-month winter hiatus, would decide which one of the German teams should advance to the tournament in Switzerland.

Saarland, which had already secured second in the group ahead of Norway, needed a win at home to finish first, yet lost 3–1. Unbeaten West Germany topped the final ranking, went to Switzerland and won the 1954 World Cup there. Sepp Herberger would have capped Kurt Clemens for West Germany, but he was ineligible like all others who had played international games for Saarland.

This was the Saarland&#x27;s only separate entry in the World Cup; its players, coaches and staff would join West Germany to assist in the defence of the World Cup in 1958.

==Player records==
In total, 42 players appeared for the Saarland national team. Waldemar Philippi holds the record for the most caps, appearing in 18 out of the team&#x27;s 19 matches and only missing a friendly against Uruguay in 1954.

==Anthem==
Saarland, having just been separated from Germany, did not have a national anthem of its own, and so the first international football fixture (1950 vs. Switzerland) was the reason to establish the Saarlandlied as the anthem for such events.

==Change of era==
* 1264 ; 1264: The new era name was created to mark an event or a number of events. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Kōchō&quot; 4. The era name comes from the &quot;Book of Later Han&quot; and combines the characters (&quot;writing&quot;) and (&quot;perpetual&quot;).

* May 4, 1274 (&quot;Bun&#x27;ei 11, 26th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Emperor Go-Uda is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). The retired Emperor Kameyama continued to exercise power as cloistered emperor.
* November 19, 1274 (&quot;Bun&#x27;ei 11, 20th day of the 10th month&quot;): Battle of Bun&#x27;ei -- Kublai Khan&#x27;s Mongol forces land at Hakata Bay near Fukuoka in Kyūshū. After landing and some armed skirmishes, the invaders withdraw to spend the night on shipboard. That night, a storm sinks several ships, and the fleet retreats to Korea rather than pressing their initial advantage. In the course of the day&#x27;s fighting, the Hakozaki Shrine was burned to the ground. &quot;Nihon Ōdai Ichiran&quot; explains that the invaders were defeated because they lacked arrows.

<text>William Struth (16 June 1875 – 21 September 1956) was a Scottish football manager. He was the second manager of Rangers Football Club, leading the club for 34 years between 1920 and 1954, as well as being the holder of a number of other positions, including director. Struth is one of the most successful managers in Scottish and British football history, winning 30 major trophies in his career; a record 18 Scottish league championships, 10 Scottish Cups and two Scottish League Cups.

==Career==
Struth was born in Leith, Edinburgh, the eldest child of William Struth senior, a stonemason, and Isabella Cunningham. He grew up in Edinburgh and Milnathort (his father&#x27;s birthplace) in Kinross-shire and worked as a stonemason, but he also competed as a professional runner until he was in his 30s. In the early 1900s he began helping to train the players at his local football club, Heart of Midlothian, and in 1908 he moved to Glasgow to become the trainer at Clyde. For three seasons at Shawfield he worked alongside Alex Maley, brother of the Celtic manager Willie Maley.

Struth moved to Rangers in 1914 to take up the position of assistant manager. At the age of 45, in 1920, he took over as manager after his predecessor William Wilton drowned in a boating accident off Gourock.

Struth went on to win the league title 18 times as manager, winning 14 titles in 19 years before the Second World War. This included winning five titles in a row between 1927 and 1931. Struth&#x27;s tenure as manager spanned the club&#x27;s first league and cup double in 1928, when Rangers lifted the Scottish Cup and ended a 25-year &#x27;hoodoo&#x27;, and its first treble in 1949, Struth becoming the first Scottish manager to achieve this honour.
If wartime competitions (the 1939–40 Scottish Emergency League followed by six wartime Southern League championships, the Scottish War Emergency Cup, the 1946 Victory Cup, a Summer Cup and four Southern League Cups) and local tournaments (19 Glasgow Cups, 20 Glasgow Merchants Charity Cups) are included, Struth won a total of 73 trophies during his career, making him the most decorated manager in British football history.

Struth was renowned as a disciplinarian, insisting that the team wore a collar and tie when turning up for training; bowler hats were obligatory for Rangers players. Adam Little was signed by Struth and this interview gives an insight into his methods. 

In 1947, Struth became a Rangers director and was then appointed vice-chairman after retiring in 1954. In 1952 he had part of a leg amputated as a result of gangrene. He died on 21 September 1956, aged 81, at his home in Dumbreck and is buried in Craigton Cemetery, overlooking Ibrox Stadium. His wife, Catherine Forbes, predeceased him in 1941. The grave lies in the south-west section on a terrace on its north side.

==Recognition==

In 2005, Rangers&#x27; chairman Sir David Murray unveiled a bronze bust of Bill Struth, located in the Main Stand at Ibrox, now known as the &quot;Bill Struth Main Stand&quot; in honour of his contribution to Rangers Football Club.

<text>In fashion, an accessory is an item used to contribute, in a secondary manner, to an individual&#x27;s outfit. Accessories are often chosen to complete an outfit and complement the wearer&#x27;s look. They have the capacity to further express an individual&#x27;s identity and personality. Accessories come in different shapes, sizes, hues, etc. The term came into use in the 16th century.

== Types ==
Fashion accessories may be loosely categorized into two general areas: carried accessories and worn accessories. Carried accessories include purses and handbags, hand fans, parasols and umbrellas, wallets, canes, and ceremonial swords. Worn accessories include cravats, ties, hats, bonnets, belts and suspenders, gloves, muffs, necklaces, bracelets, watches, eyewear, sashes, shawls, scarves, lanyards, socks, pins, piercings, rings, stockings and hair ties.

Shoes, boots, sneakers, and all types of footwear are not accessories but &#x27;wear for the foot&#x27;. The type of accessory that an individual chooses to wear or carry to complement their outfit can be determined by several factors, including the specific context of where the individual is going. For example, if an individual is going to work their choice of accessory would differ from someone who is going out to drinks or dinner; thus depending on work or play different accessories would be chosen. Similarly, an individual&#x27;s economic status, religious and cultural background would also be a contributing factor.

== History ==
In Victorian fashion accessories such as fans, parasols and gloves held significance for how women experienced gender, race, and class. In this era, there was a trend for women to adopt, or aspire to, a more leisurely lifestyle. Consequently, gloves were often used by women to cover their hands and mask any signs of labour. One fashion accessory commonly worn by women in Victorian England was the slide bracelet. Slide bracelets were worn after the wrist watch came into fashion. 

During the early 16th century, in Italy hat badges were worn by civilian men of higher social status as a decorative item, in imitation of the cap badges worn by the invading military. Hat badges were often worn in conjunction with a decorative sword and hilt. Hat badges were fashioned after plaquettes and often depicted a scene with personal relevance to the wearer.

<doc id="1102059" wikidata="Q736274" url="?curid=1102059" title="Papa Wemba">
<text>Jules Shungu Wembadio Pene Kikumba (14 June 1949 – 24 April 2016), known professionally as Papa Wemba (), was a Congolese singer and musician who played Congolese rumba, soukous, and ndombolo. Dubbed the &quot;King of Rumba Rock&quot;, he was one of the most popular musicians of his time in Africa and played an important role in world music. He was also a fashion icon who popularized the Sape look and style through his musical group Viva la Musica, with whom he performed on stages throughout the world.

==Musical career==
Papa Wemba&#x27;s road to fame and prominence began when he joined the music group Zaiko Langa Langa in 1969. This was followed by his success as a founding member both of Isifi Lokole and then Yoka Lokole, along with a short stint as a member of Afrisa International for a few months. During these early stages of his career, he was establishing a style that included traditional Congolese rumba and soukous, infused with traditional African sounds, Caribbean rhythms, rock and soul. But Wemba gained international success and status with his band Viva La Musica, especially after he took them to Paris, France in the early 1980s. It was there that Wemba was able to achieve more of an &quot;eclectic sound&quot; in his work, influenced by western popular music that reflected a European flavor and style, referred to as &quot;Europop.&quot; Wemba spoke about this transition in his music during a 2004 interview:

===Zaïko Langa Langa===

On 23 December 1969 Wemba, who was accompanying one of the Mitshio brothers to visit their aunt in Kinshasa, found the band Bel Guide National rehearsing in the backyard. He asked them if he could perform a song for them. He sang &quot;Adios Théthé&quot; by Tabu Ley Rochereau and impressed the band’s administrators. The next day, Bel Guide National was dissolved by its administration which decided to form (with Wemba as a singer) what-became the influential rock-rumba band &quot;Zaïko Langa Langa&quot; (ZLL) keeping just two Bel Guide National members: Jossart N&#x27;Yoka Longo and Félix Manuaku Waku. He remained with the group for four years.

Papa Wemba (then known as Jules Presley Shungu Wembadio) helped contribute to the success of &quot;Zaiko Langa Langa&quot; so that, by 1973, it was one of the more successful Congolese groups. By that time, ZLL&#x27;s shows and performances featured a string of their popular hits, some of them written by Wemba. The latter included &quot;Pauline&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est La Vérité&quot;, &quot;Chouchouna&quot;, and &quot;Liwa Ya Somo&quot;.

&quot;Zaiko Langa Langa&quot; had gained a strong and popular following even in a Congolese musical world that, in those days, was already dominated by various musical acts including Franco Luambo and his band TPOK Jazz, or Tabu Ley Rochereau&#x27;s various ensembles. ZLL was also vying for an audience with other (at the time) new musical acts such as Bella-Bella and Empire Bakuba.

===Isifi Lokole===
In December 1974, at the pinnacle of their fame (and just a month after the Rumble in the Jungle between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa), Papa Wemba (usually called &#x27;Shungu Wembadio&#x27; at this point in his career) along with Evoloko Lay Lay, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana, left Zaiko Langa Langa to establish their own musical ensemble &quot;Isifi Lokole.&quot; Wemba later claimed that ISIFI was an acronym for &quot;Institut du Savoir Ideologique pour la Formation des Idoles,&quot; a claim that has still not been given total credence. In July 1975, Shungu Wembadio officially adopted the soon-to-be-well-known-worldwide name &quot;Papa Wemba&quot;. The &quot;Papa&quot; (father) part of his name had already been given to him as a traditional and cultural rite because he was his mother&#x27;s first-born son. But in assuming a new name and public persona, &quot;Papa&quot; was now re-emphasized as an allusion to the demanding family responsibilities that Wemba assumed at very young age, since both parents were now deceased: Wemba&#x27;s father in 1966, followed by his mother in 1973. &quot;Isifi Lokole&quot; would only last a year together as a group, with the single &quot;Amazone&quot; (a Wemba composition) as its biggest commercial &quot;hit&quot; record.

===Yoka Lokole===
In November 1975, Papa Wemba, Mavuela Somo and Bozi Boziana left &quot;Isifi Lokole&quot; to create the group &quot;Yoka Lokole&quot; (also known as The Kinshasa&#x27;s Wa Fania All-Stars). &quot;Yoka Lokole&quot; contributed to the African pop music wave with their hit songs including &quot;Matembele Bangui&quot;, &quot;Lisuma ya Zazu&quot; (Papa Wemba), &quot;Mavuela Sala Keba&quot;, and &quot;Bana Kin&quot; (Mavuela Somo).

Like &quot;Isifi Lokole&quot;, the electronic-instrument-driven &quot;Yoka Lokole&quot; would not last much longer than a year. After a year of modest success, controversies within &quot;Yoka Lokole&quot; over money and prestige were also complicated by Wemba&#x27;s arrest and brief incarceration in Kinshasa Central prison in December 1976 when he was suspected of having a relationship with army general&#x27;s daughter. The band continued to tour without Papa Wemba. For whatever reason (or reasons), whether it was personal or professional (with one source speculating that he was perhaps feeling diminished in the public&#x27;s eye), by 1977 Wemba had formed a new group, and called it &quot;Viva la Musica&quot;.

===Viva la Musica===
In 1977–78, back home now in the Matonge neighborhood of Kinshasa, Papa Wemba set out to create his group &quot;Viva la Musica&quot;. This new band&#x27;s name was suggested to him in 1974, when he attended a concert in Kinshasa that featured the New York-based Latinos, &quot;Fania All-Stars&quot;. During the concert, one of the singers would shout to the audience &quot;Viva La Musica!&quot; to an enthusiastic response. Wemba&#x27;s vision was to structure &quot;Viva la Musica&quot; around young, talented but largely unknown artists, including the singers Prince Espérant, Jadot &quot;le Cambodgien&quot; Sombele, Debaba el Shabab, Pepe Bipoli and Petit Aziza, and various guitarists such as Rigo Star, Syriana, and Bongo Wende. The new group included the traditional instrument lokole. There was also an associated dance, the &quot;mukonyonyo&quot;, as well as a fashion style.

The band achieved immediate success and, during their first year performing together, the Kinshasa newspaper &quot;Elima&quot; named the band &quot;best orchestra&quot; and their single, &quot;Mère Supérieure,&quot; best song. During the following three years, &quot;Viva la Musica&quot; built on these initial accolades with more hit songs including &quot;Moku Nyon Nyon&quot;, &quot;Nyekesse Migue&#x27;l&quot;, and &quot;Cou Cou Dindon&quot;. As time went by, it was revealed that Antoine Agbepa was the unknown writer of many of these songs, when Papa Wemba said, &quot;Ooh! l&#x27;homme idée&quot; (Oh! the idea-man!), thereby on-the-spot renaming the impressive young singer-songwriter Koffi Olomide – and the name stuck.

After his success already with three influential groups, in 1977 Papa Wemba established a kind of commune for musicians. To accomplish this, he used his family home (on Kanda-Kanda street) as a fashionable gathering place for Matonge youths. He named it &quot;Village Molokai&quot; and declared himself to be its tribal chief (&quot;chef coutumier&quot;).

===Move to Paris===
Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wemba (both by himself and with Viva la Musica) started traveling to Paris, believing there was a potentially wider audience for the music he had been helping to create during the preceding decade. As Wemba biographer Craig Harris put it:

By the late 1980s and early 1990s, Wemba&#x27;s style was more readily identifiable even as it had become an amalgamation of rumba, soukous and ndombolo, Latin and rock, melded to a European-oriented pop style. But still wanting to expand their musical horizons, and move in new musical directions, &quot;Viva la Musica&quot; took on a dual-identity. Wemba now maintained one group in Kinshasa (called at times &quot;Nouvelle Ecriture&quot;, &quot;Nouvel Ecrita&quot; and then again &quot;Viva la Musica&quot;) and another one in Paris (&quot;Nouvelle Generation,&quot; &quot;La Cour des Grands&quot; and now &quot;Viva Tendance&quot;). The group consistently maintained a high profile in world music with hits like &quot;Le Voyageur&quot; (1992), &quot;Emotion&quot; (1995), &quot;Pole Position&quot; (1996) and &quot;Somo Trop&quot; (October 2003).

By this time, Wemba&#x27;s use of African, Cuban and Western influences was not only one of Africa&#x27;s most popular music styles, it was crossing cultural boundaries and attracting a more diverse audience outside of Africa. In 1993, Wemba joined with Peter Gabriel for the latter&#x27;s Secret World Tour, and this drew attention to Wemba&#x27;s unique style and groundbreaking sound. The aforementioned &quot;Emotion&quot; album, released in 1995, showed that he was achieving a global following. This album appeared under Peter Gabriel&#x27;s Real World record label, and sold more than 100,000 copies.

==Legal issues==
In February 2003, Wemba was suspected of being involved in a network that had allegedly assisted hundreds of people in illegally immigrating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo into Europe. At that point he was arrested in Paris and held while awaiting a trial. He then spent three-and-a-half months in prison until a €30,000 bail was posted (some reports claimed it was paid by the Congolese government). In June 2003 Wemba was released from prison which was an experience that, upon his release, he declared had had a profound psychological effect on him. The singer claimed to have undergone a spiritual conversion in jail and even recounted this episode on his album &quot;Somo Trop&quot; (released in October 2003). On the song &quot;Numéro d&#x27;écrou&quot;, he recalled the day &quot;God&quot; paid a visit to his cell. In 2004, he was convicted in France, fined, and given a suspended prison sentence. Wemba returned to the Congo in 2006.

==Cultural influence==
===Music===
Papa Wemba&#x27;s impact on the culture is also reflected by his influence on a new generation of musicians and performers. For example, Priyan Weerappuli (leader of the Sri Lankan group Pahan Silu) referred to Wemba as being among his greatest musical influences. Weerappuli claims that he was first introduced to Wemba&#x27;s music in 2004 and was &quot;deeply inspired by the free rhythms demonstrated by Wemba&#x27;s Soukous style&quot; and, from that point, &quot;began experimenting with these rhythms in his own compositions.&quot;

Many others paid tribute to Papa Wemba&#x27;s legacy after his death in April 2016. Some of them included not only Koffi Olomide and Manu Dibango (both mentioned previously), but musicians King Kikii and Femi Kuti, along with soccer star Samuel Eto&#x27;o (among others) gave testimony to his lasting influence on them.

===Fashion===
In 1979, Papa Wemba became the unofficial leader of La Sape (Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes d&#x27;Élégance, literally translated as the &quot;Society of Atmosphere-setters and Elegant People&quot;) which he promoted as a youth subculture in Zaire. Their style was influenced by the fashion centres of Paris and Milan. Wemba said:

The Sapeur cult promoted high standards of personal cleanliness, hygiene and smart dress, to a whole generation of youth across Zaire. When I say well groomed, well shaved, well perfumed, it&#x27;s a characteristic that I am insisting on among the young. I don&#x27;t care about their education, since education always comes first of all from the family.

After Wemba&#x27;s death, Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango told the BBC during an interview:

==Film career==
Papa Wemba got some attention as a movie actor, primarily because he played the male lead role in a very successful Zairean film &quot;La Vie est Belle&quot; (Life is Beautiful) [1987] by Belgian director Benoît Lamy and Congolese producer-director Ngangura Mweze. Wemba made another kind of contribution to cinema, thanks to his work on the soundtracks for &quot;Children of Men&quot;, &quot;Besieged&quot;, and &quot;Black Mic Mac&quot;. Wemba is also credited as &quot;composer&quot; of the scores for the films &quot;Identity Pieces&quot;, &quot;Macadam tribu&quot;, along with &quot;Life is Beautiful.&quot;.

During his life, Wemba acted in a few more successful films, although he played only minor roles. As recently as 2012, he had a cameo role in the Belgian drama film &quot;Kinshasa Kids&quot;. Beyond the impact of his important role in &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, there are his many music videos and recorded band performances. Also, Wemba is featured (as himself) in many documentary films which were generally well received including; &quot;The Importance of Being Elegant&quot;, &quot;The Real World of Peter Gabriel&quot; and &quot;The African Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Years&quot; (all television) documentaries).

==Death==
Wemba died at the age of 66 after collapsing on stage in Abidjan, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, during the FEMUA urban music festival on Sunday 24 April 2016. On Monday 25 April it was reported that his widow, Mama-Marie Luzolo Amazone, flew to Abidjan &quot;accompanied by family members and government officials.&quot; In Wemba&#x27;s hometown of Kinshasa, both fellow musicians and fans gathered together as a tribute to his legacy. Similar tributes also took place in Paris, London, Brussels and Nairobi. He was posthumously awarded the Grand Officer of the Order of the National Heroes Kabila-Lumumba at the Palais du Peuple in Kinshasa.

<text>Plutus (, &quot;Ploutos&quot;, &quot;Wealth&quot;) is an Ancient Greek comedy by the playwright Aristophanes, which was first produced in 388 BC. A political satire on contemporary Athens, it features the personified god of wealth Plutus. Reflecting the development of Old Comedy towards New Comedy, it uses such familiar character types as the stupid master and the insubordinate slave to attack the morals of the time.

==Plot==
The play features an elderly Athenian citizen, Chremylos, and his slave Cario or Carion. Chremylos presents himself and his family as virtuous but poor, and has accordingly gone to seek advice from an oracle. The play begins as he returns to Athens from Delphi, having been instructed by Apollo to follow the first man he meets and persuade him to come home with him. That man turns out to be the god Plutus — who is, contrary to all expectations, a blind beggar. After much argument, Plutus is convinced to enter Chremylos&#x27;s house, where he will have his vision restored, meaning that &quot;wealth&quot; will now go only to those who deserve it in one way or another.

The first part of the play examines the idea that wealth is not distributed to the virtuous, or necessarily to the non-virtuous, but instead it is distributed randomly. Chremylos is convinced that if Plutus&#x27;s eyesight can be restored, these wrongs can be righted, making the world a better place.

The second part introduces the goddess Penia (Poverty). She counters Chremylos&#x27;s arguments that it is better to be rich by arguing that without poverty there would be no slaves (as every slave would buy his freedom) and no fine goods or luxury foods (as nobody would work if everyone were rich).

After Plutus&#x27;s eyesight is restored at the Temple of Asclepius, he formally becomes a member of Chremylos&#x27;s household. At the same time, the entire world is turned upside-down economically and socially. Unsurprisingly, this gives rise to rancorous comments and claims of unfairness from those who have been deprived of their riches.

In the end, the messenger god Hermes arrives to inform Chremylos and his family of the gods&#x27; anger. As in Aristophanes&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot;, the gods have been starved of sacrifices, since human beings have all directed their attention to Plutus, and they no longer pay homage to the traditional Olympian gods. Hermes, worried about his own predicament, actually offers to work for the mortals and enters Chremylos&#x27;s house as a servant on those conditions.

==Performance history==
&quot;Plutus&quot; was the last performance of Aristophanes that occurred during his lifetime. Plutus was also one of the first Greek plays to be performed using the new (post-Reformation) pronunciation of Greek diphthongs developed by John Cheke and Thomas Smith during the 1530s, when it was enacted at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

<doc id="1102118" wikidata="Q486455" url="?curid=1102118" title="Song Seung-heon">
<text>Song Seung-heon (; born October 5, 1976) is a South Korean model and actor. He has acted in various television dramas, notably &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot; (2000), &quot;&quot;East of Eden&quot;&quot; (2008), &quot;&quot;My Princess&quot;&quot; (2011), &quot;Black&quot; (2017), &quot;Player&quot; (2018), &quot;The Great Show&quot; (2019), and &quot;Dinner Mate&quot; (2020). His latest on-screen appearance was in the fourth season of &quot;Voice&quot; (2021).

==Career==
===1995–2004: Beginnings and Pan-asia stardom===
Song Seung-heon began his career in 1995 as a model for the jeans brand &quot;292513=STORM&quot;, and first became known to viewers in the popular sitcom &quot;Three Guys, Three Girls&quot; in 1996. The following year he debuted as an actor. His feature film debut came in 1999 in the film &quot;Calla&quot; co-starring Kim Hee-sun.

True stardom came to Song in late 2000, with the broadcast of the hugely popular TV drama &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot;. The romantic melodrama series was a ratings success, pioneering a trend in Korean melodramatic series and launching a fever that is commonly referred to as the &quot;Korean Wave&quot; and leading to Song becoming a Hallyu star. Since then he has been actively recruited for film roles and advertisements in Japan, Hong Kong and other Asian countries.

In 2002, Song starred in the action comedy &quot;Make It Big&quot; by director Cho Ui-seok, and also in the Hong Kong film &quot;So Close&quot; with actresses Karen Mok, Shu Qi and Zhao Wei.

Song further solidified his status as a Hallyu (Korean Wave) star in 2003 with &quot;Summer Scent&quot;, co-starring Son Ye-jin. The series is the third &quot;season-themed&quot; Yoon Seok-ho TV drama after &quot;Autumn in My Heart&quot; and &quot;Winter Sonata&quot;, but did not become as popular as the ones that preceded it.

In 2004, Song appeared in two films, but neither was a success: &quot;Ice Rain&quot;, shot in the Canadian Rockies, failed to enthuse viewers with its mixture of mountaineering and melodrama, while &quot;He Was Cool&quot;, based on an internet novel by Guiyeoni, was unable to compete with &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot; and other films from the 2004 summer season.

=== 2005–2007: Enlistment and scandal ===
Meanwhile, in late 2004, just as he was getting ready to start shooting another high-profile TV drama &quot;Sad Love Story&quot;, it was revealed that the actor had illegally avoided his compulsory military service by submitting tainted urine samples that suggested he was suffering from certain illnesses and was thus unfit for the army. Amidst the press coverage and scandal this aroused, Song agreed to immediately serve his two-year term in the military. Song was discharged on November 15, 2006, with the rank of corporal, to much fanfare and media attention. For a time he kept a low profile, trying to gauge public opinion on his return to the entertainment world.

===2008–2013: Comeback===
For his comeback, Song took on a tough image, playing aggressive and masculine roles in the 2008 drama &quot;East of Eden&quot;, which he won the &quot;Daesang&quot; (Grand Prize) for at the MBC Drama Awards. He also starred in the action film &quot;Fate&quot;, and the 2010 remake &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot;.

His popularity in Japan continued, and in 2010 he starred in &quot;Ghost&quot; remake &quot;&quot; with Matsushima Nanako.

In 2011, Song starred in &quot;My Princess&quot; opposite Kim Tae-hee, his first romantic comedy. He considers the series a turning point in his career, saying, &quot;Previously, I took on characters living a life full of ups and downs. For me, Hae-young was the first character that was so rich, bright and cheerful. I felt much lighter while acting the character.&quot;

His 30-minute short film &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot;, helmed by director Chang of 2008 feature &quot;Death Bell&quot;, was shot particularly for his fans in China and Japan and released on DVD in early 2012.

Based on the original comic by Motoka Murakami and previously dramatized in Japan, in 2012&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jin&quot; Song played the titular smart and cold-hearted surgeon who takes a journey back through time to the late 19th century Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). He then played a cold-hearted loan shark and gangster who morphs into a successful businessman for his love in 2013 melodrama &quot;When a Man Falls in Love&quot;.

===2014–present: Mature roles===
In 2014, Song starred in Kim Dae-woo&#x27;s erotic period film &quot;Obsessed&quot;. Set in 1969 at the end of the Vietnam War, he played a high-ranking officer suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who falls into an obsessive love affair with his subordinate&#x27;s wife.

In 2015, he starred in the Chinese romantic melodrama &quot;The Third Way of Love&quot;, followed by family comedy &quot;Wonderful Nightmare&quot;. Song was next cast as a fighter pilot in his second Chinese project, World War II film &quot;Air Strike&quot;. He is also set to star in the film &quot;Man of Will&quot;, portraying a cruel and cold-hearted prison director.

Back on the Korean screen in 2017, Song starred opposite Lee Young-ae in period drama &quot;Saimdang, Memoir of Colors&quot;, about the Joseon artist and calligrapher Shin Saimdang; Song played a fictional character, an aristocrat and painter who has loved the heroine since childhood. The same year, he was cast in the fantasy thriller drama &quot;Black&quot; alongside Go Ara, playing the role of a grim reaper. Song reunited with &quot;Black&quot; director Ko Jae-hyun in another OCN drama &quot;Player&quot; in 2018, playing the role of a con-artist.

In 2019, Song starred in the political family comedy drama &quot;The Great Show&quot;.
In April 2019, Song signed with new agency King Kong by Starship.

In 2020, Song starred in the romance drama &quot;Dinner Mate&quot; as a psychiatrist.

In 2021, Song took the role as the main lead in the fourth season of &quot;Voice&quot;.

== Other activities ==
In 2009 he founded his own management agency, Storm S Company (later renamed Better ENT, now majority-owned by KOSDAQ-listed Signal Entertainment Group). It currently manages actors Kim Min-jung, Chae Jung-an and Goo Jae-yi. Song also owns the Sinsa-dong branch of Italian restaurant chain Blacksmith, launched by Caffe Bene.

In 2011, Song was named PR ambassador for cultural sharing by the Korea Foundation. His role was to promote Korean language, food and other cultural heritages overseas. In 2015, he was named as a promotional ambassador for the National Tax Service.

<doc id="1102119" wikidata="Q886459" url="?curid=1102119" title="Blood eagle">
<text>The blood eagle was a method of ritual execution as detailed in late skaldic poetry. According to the two instances mentioned in the Christian sagas, the victims (in both cases members of royal families) were placed in a prone position, their ribs severed from the spine with a sharp tool, and their lungs pulled through the opening to create a pair of &quot;wings&quot;. There has been continuing debate about whether the rite was a literary invention of the original texts, a mistranslation of the texts themselves, or an authentic historical practice.

==Accounts==
The blood-eagle ritual-killing rite appears in just two instances in Norse literature, plus oblique references some have interpreted as referring to the same practice. The primary versions share certain commonalities: the victims are both noblemen (Halfdan Haaleg or &quot;Long-leg&quot; was a prince; Ælla of Northumbria a king), and both of the executions were in retaliation for the murder of a father.

===Einarr and Halfdan ===

There are two sources that purport to describe Torf-Einarr&#x27;s ritual execution of Harald Fairhair&#x27;s son, Halfdan Long-Leg, in the late 9th century. Both were written several centuries after the events they depict, and exist in various versions known to have influenced each other.

In the &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, the blood eagle is described as a sacrifice to Odin.

Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; contains an account of the same event described in &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot;, with Einarr actually performing the deed himself:

=== Ragnar Lodbrok&#x27;s sons and King Ælla of Northumbria===
In &quot;Þáttr af Ragnars sonum&quot; (the &quot;Tale of Ragnar&#x27;s sons&quot;), Ivar the Boneless has captured king Ælla of Northumbria, who had killed Ivar&#x27;s father Ragnar Loðbrók. The killing of Ælla, after a battle for control of York, is described thus:


The blood eagle is referred to by the 11th-century poet Sigvatr Þórðarson, who, some time between 1020 and 1038, wrote a skaldic verse named &quot;Knútsdrápa&quot; that recounts and establishes Ivar the Boneless as having killed Ælla and subsequently cutting his back.

Sighvatr&#x27;s skaldic verse:

Skaldic verse, a common medium of Norse poets, was meant to be cryptic and allusive, and the idiomatic nature of Sighvatr&#x27;s poem as a description of what has become known as the blood eagle is a matter of historical contention, particularly since in Norse imagery the eagle was strongly associated with blood and death.

Saxo Grammaticus in tells the following about Bjørn and Sigvard, sons of Ragnar Lodbrok and king Ælla:
===Other accounts===
Another possible oblique reference to the rite appears in . There are two stanzas of verse near the end of its section 6, &quot;Sigurd Felled the Sons of Hunding&quot;, where a character describing previous events says:


==Authenticity==
There is debate about whether the blood eagle was historically practiced, or whether it was a literary device invented centuries later by the Christian Norse authors who transcribed the sagas. No contemporary accounts of the rite exist, and the scant references in the sagas are several hundred years after the Christianization of Scandinavia.

In the 1970s, Alfred Smyth supported the historicity of the rite, stating that it is clearly human sacrifice to the Norse god Odin. He characterized St. Dunstan&#x27;s description of Ælla&#x27;s killing as an &quot;accurate account of a body subjected to the ritual of the blood eagle&quot;.

Roberta Frank reviewed the historical evidence for the rite in her &quot;Viking Atrocity and Skaldic Verse: The Rite of the Blood-Eagle&quot;, where she writes: &quot;By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the various saga motifs—eagle sketch, rib division, lung surgery, and &#x27;saline stimulant&#x27;—were combined in inventive sequences designed for maximum horror.&quot; She concludes that the authors of the sagas misunderstood alliterative kennings that alluded to leaving one&#x27;s foes face down on the battlefield, their backs torn as carrion by scavenging birds. She compared the lurid details of the blood eagle to Christian martyrdom tracts, such as that relating the tortures of Saint Sebastian, shot so full of arrows that his ribs and internal organs were exposed. She suggests that these tales of martyrdom inspired further exaggeration of the misunderstood skaldic verses into a grandiose torture and death rite with no actual historic basis. David Horspool in his book &quot;King Alfred: Burnt Cakes and Other Legends&quot;, while not committing to the historical veracity of the rite, also saw parallels to martyrdom tracts. Frank&#x27;s paper sparked a &quot;lively debate&quot;.

Ronald Hutton&#x27;s &quot;The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy&quot; states that &quot;the hitherto notorious rite of the &#x27;Blood Eagle,&#x27; the killing of a defeated warrior by pulling up his ribs and lungs through his back, has been shown to be almost certainly a Christian myth resulting from the misunderstanding of some older verse.&quot;

While taking no view on the historical authenticity of the ritual, the authors of a 2022 study concluded that the ritual as described was not inconsistent either with physiology or the tools available within the sociocultural context of the Viking era. They further concluded that, were it performed in the most extreme versions depicted in the sagas and the subject of the torture still lived at that point, death would have followed the severing of the ribs from the spine within seconds, due either to exsanguination or asphyxiation.

<text>Pär Anders Nuder (born 27 February 1963) is a Swedish Social Democratic former politician. He was member of Parliament 1994 to 2009, minister for finance from 2004 to 2006, minister for policy co-ordination and state secretary and chief of staff to the prime minister, Göran Persson, 1997–2002.

Today, Pär Nuder is a businessman with several assigments in the private sector as an advisor and as a board member. He is also active in various non-profit organisazation. Nuder is the chairman of the Third Swedish National Pension Fund (AP3), one of Sweden&#x27;s leading pension companies AMF and Hemsö, and on the board of several Nordic companies. He is a senior counselor at Albright Stonebridge Group and an industrial advisor to the private-equity firm EQT AB.

==Biography==
Pär Nuder grew up in Österåker, where he still resides. His father, Ants Nuder, was one of the numerous Estonian refugees who fled to Sweden to escape the Soviet invasion at the end of World War II. During his childhood, Nuder spent several summers in Israel, which has resulted in a strong personal commitment to the Middle East peace process. Educated at Stockholm University, he has a Bachelor of Laws degree.

==Career==
===Politics===
His political path began in the local Swedish Social Democratic Youth League club. From 1986 to 1989, he was the chairman of the Stockholm County branch of the organisation and from 1987 to 1990 he was a member of the national board. At the same time he was a member of the Österåker municipal executive committee, from 1982 to 1994. In 1986, he started his career as a political adviser, first to the minister for justice (before being forced to resign in October 1987 as a result of the political fallout of the Soviet spy Stig Bergling&#x27;s escape from custody) and later to the prime minister, first to Ingvar Carlsson, and to his successor, Göran Persson. For a few years he also worked as a political secretary to the Social Democratic parliamentary party group. In 1994, he was elected a member of parliament.

In 1997, he was offered the position of state secretary in the prime minister&#x27;s office. Although he was more or less unknown to the general public at the time, he was generally believed to be Persson&#x27;s close ally and one of his personal favourites to succeed him as party leader and prime minister. This impression was trengthened by Persson&#x27;s move to let Nuder join his cabinet as minister for policy co-ordination in 2002, an influential behind-the-scenes post. When Marita Ulvskog stepped down as minister for culture in September 2004, he took over the portfolio, although it was explicitly stated that this was not a long-term solution. The prime minister&#x27;s intentions instead became public on 21 October 2004, when Persson announced a restructuring of his government in which Nuder was to take over as minister of finance after Bosse Ringholm.

Responding to media questions on whether his plan was to be the next prime minister, he simply answered that he did not &quot;think about it&quot; and was concentrating on his tasks as minister of finance. He also restated the government&#x27;s goal to reduce the rate of open unemployment below four percent again.

During a speech in December 2004, he introduced the controversial term &quot;köttberg&quot; (mountain of meat) to describe the baby boomer generation (born in the 1940s). This speech addressed the potential pension bomb Sweden is facing.

During early 2008, he lost his position as Social Democratic candidate for finance minister due to quarrels with party leader Mona Sahlin. Nuder himself said, &quot;If [Mona Sahlin] believes there is another person better suited to speak for the economic policy of Social Democracy in Sweden, then I won&#x27;t hesitate to step aside for that person.&quot; He was succeeded as economic advisor for the Social Democratic party and its candidate for finance minister for the election in 2010 by Thomas Östros, earlier minister of education.

===Private sector===
After holding central political positions for more than two decades, Nuder left politics in 2009. Since then, he has held various positions on different boards. Notably, Nuder has been the chairman of The Third National Pension Fund (AP3), AMF Pension, and Hemsö AB. Nuder has also been an advisor to the private equity firm EQT and member of the President&#x27;s Advisory Council, Tokyo University.

Currently Nuder is a senior counselor of the strategy firm Albright Stonebridge Group, advising clients on financial trends and providing strategic advice to clients seeking to enter the European market. He is also chairman of the board of Aimo Holding AB, and of the non-profit foundation Sweden-Estonia Cooperation Fund.

Nuder was a columnist at the business newspaper &quot;Dagens industri&quot; for seven years and has written an autobiography called &quot;Stolt men inte nöjd: en kärleksförklaring till politiken&quot;.

Pär Nuder has been awarded H.M. The King&#x27;s Medal 12th size with the ribbon of the Order of the Seraphim and The Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana, 3rd Class, Estonia.

<text>Sambandar (Tamil: சம்பந்தர், romanized: &quot;Campantar&quot;), also referred to as Tirujnana Sambandar (Tamil: திருஞானசம்பந்தர், romanized: &quot;Tiruñāṉacampantar&quot;), was a Shaiva poet-saint of Tamil Nadu who lived sometime in the 7th century CE. According to the Tamil Shaiva tradition, he composed an of 16,000 hymns in complex meters, of which 383 (384) hymns with 4,181 stanzas have survived. These narrate an intense loving devotion (&quot;bhakti&quot;) to the Hindu god Shiva. Sambandar died when he was sixteen years of age. The surviving compositions of the poet-saint are preserved in the first three volumes of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, and provide a part of the philosophical foundation of Shaiva Siddhanta.

He is one of the most prominent of the sixty-three Nayanars, Tamil Shaiva bhakti saints who lived between the sixth and the tenth centuries CE. He was a contemporary of Appar, another Shaiva poet-saint.

==Life==

Information about Sambandar comes mainly from the &quot;Periya Puranam&quot;, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, along with the earlier &quot;Tiruttondartokai&quot;, poetry by Sundarar and Nambiyandar Nambi&#x27;s &quot;Tiru Tondar Tiruvandadi&quot;. A Sanskrit hagiography called &quot;Brahmapureesa Charitam&quot; is now lost. The first three volumes of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot; contain three hundred and eighty-four poems of Sambandar, all that survive out of a reputed more than 10,000 hymns.

According to the Tamil texts, Sambandar was born to Sivapada Hrudiyar and his wife Bhagavathiar who lived in Sirkazhi, Tamil Nadu. They were Shaivite Brahmins. When Sambandar was three years old, his parents took him to the Shiva temple, where Shiva and his consort Parvati appeared before the child. His father saw drops of milk on the child&#x27;s mouth and asked who had fed him, whereupon the boy pointed to the sky and responded with the song &quot;Todudaya Seviyan&quot;, the first verse of the &quot;Tevaram&quot;. At the age of three, he is said to have mastered the Vedas. Sambandar died in the Tamil month of Vaikasi at the age of sixteen at his wedding.

===Inscriptions===
An inscription of Rajaraja Chola I at Tiruvarur mentions Sambandar along with Appar, Sundarar and the latter&#x27;s wife Nangai Paravaiyar.

Many other inscriptions likely are related to the musical bhakti singing tradition founded by Sambandar and other Nayanars. The singers of these hymns were referred to as &quot;Tirupadiyam Vinnapam seyvar&quot; or &quot;Pidarar&quot; in Tamil inscriptions from about the 8th to 16th centuries, such as the inscriptions of Nandivarman III in the Tiruvallam Bilavaneswara temple records. Rajaraja deputed 48 &quot;pidarars&quot; and made liberal provisions for their maintenance and successors. A few earlier records give details about the gifts rendered to the singers of &quot;Tevaram&quot; from Parantaka I of the 8th century. A record belonging to Rajendra I mentions &quot;Tevaranayakan&quot;, the supervisor of &quot;Tevaram&quot; and shows the institutionalisation of &quot;Tevaram&quot; with the establishment of a department. There are records from Kulothunga Chola III from Nallanyanar temple in South Arcot indicating singing of &quot;Tiruvempavai&quot; and &quot;Tiruvalam&quot; of Manickavasagar during special occasion in the temple.

===Iconography===
Sambandar&#x27;s image is found in almost all Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu. He is depicted as a dancing child or a young teen with his right forefinger pointing upwards, reflecting the legend where he credits Parvati-Shiva for what he has. A Chola bronze of Sambandar with a height of in standing posture dated to about the 12th century was found in Velankanni in Nagapattinam district. He is sported with &quot;catura&quot; posture with his feat on Padmasana and he is sported with jewels around his neck. Another image found in Tiruindalur in dancing posture with a height of dated 1150 has Sambandar sported with his right feet over a pedestal. Both the bronze images are stored in the Bronze gallery in Government Museum, Chennai.

==Compositions and legacy==
Sambandar is the first poet-saint featured in the &quot;Tirumurai&quot;, the canonical works of Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta. His compositions grace Volume I, II and III of the twelve-volume compilation. He has been highly influential on Tamil Shaivism. His ideas and emotional devotion to Shiva are shared by other Nayanars and the Shaiva community they help organize. He is lucid in explaining the link between the Vedic tradition and the temple tradition. According to Cort, Sambandar clearly explains this through his hymn praising the power of the &quot;namah sivaya&quot; mantra:

&lt;poem&gt;
It guides to the good path,
all those who melt with love,
and flow with tears as they chant it.
It is the essence of the four Vedas,
Chant our Lord&#x27;s name, 
say, &#x27;Hail Siva!&quot;
– Translated by John Cort&lt;/poem&gt;

This is part of the refrain found in the Vedic teaching called the &quot;Śatarudrīya saṁhita&quot;, states Cort, the foundation that transmutes that Vedic tradition into the Agamic ritual tradition of Shaiva Siddhanta. Sambandar and other Nayanars help shift the focus from celebrating the Vedic canonical text into a &quot;magical connection with Siva&quot; whereby every devotee can have a personal, direct connection to Shiva and the essence of Shiva within him or her. It helps shift the spiritual experience from being channeled through Brahmin priests to being channeled through a direct loving connection with one&#x27;s own Shiva. In effect, states Cort, &quot;the essence of the Veda&quot; displaces the Vedic text itself through the tradition pioneered by Sambandar, Appar and Sundarar.

===Temple services===

The pilgrimage to temples, associated devotional singing with music, and other rituals started by Sambandar have thrived over the centuries. In contemporary Tamil Shiva temples, &quot;Odhuvars&quot;, &quot;Sthanikars&quot;, or &quot;Kattalaiyars&quot; offer musical programmes in Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu by singing &quot;Tevaram&quot; after the daily rituals. These are usually carried out as chorus programmes soon after the divine offering. The singing of Tevaram was followed by musicals from the music pillars in such temples like Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple, Nellaiappar Temple and Suchindram.

&quot;Periya Puranam&quot;, the eleventh-century Tamil book on the Nayanars that forms the last volume of the &quot;Tirumurai&quot; primarily had references only to &quot;Tevaram&quot; and subsequently expanded to 12 parts and is one of the first anthologies of &quot;Tirumurai&quot;. One of the first anthologies of &quot;moovars&quot; hymns called the &quot;Tevara Arulmuraitirattu&quot; is linked to Tamil Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy by grouping ninety-nine verses into 10 categories. The category headings are God, soul, bond, grace, divine initiation, methodology, enlightenment, bliss, mantra and liberation - correspond to Umapthi&#x27;s work, &quot;Tiruvarutpayan&quot;. &quot;Tirumurai kanda puranam&quot; is another anthology for &quot;Tirumurai&quot; as a whole, but primarily focuses on &quot;Tevaram&quot;. It is the first of the works to refer to the collection of volumes as &quot;Tirumurai&quot;.

===Tamil Shaiva ethos===
The hymns of Sambandar include criticism and allegations of persecution of the Shaiva community by Jain monks, along with a &quot;bitter anti-Jain polemic&quot;. Sambandar critiques the duplicity he sees. The early studies of this Jain-Hindu interaction, as seen in Sambandar hymns and other early Shaiva literature, is one where Jainism is inferred as the heterodox popular religion followed by a revival and triumph of Shaiva Hinduism. The situation was likely more complicated and driven by historical developments and context. The Buddhists denied the &quot;existence of soul&quot;, states Nilakanta Sastri, while the Jains recommended &quot;asceticism and suffering&quot; – a period in Tamil culture where such &quot;pessimism&quot; must have been the ethos.

Shaivism retooled its Vedic roots and transmuted the Vedic ritual into a personalized temple bhakti ritual. Thus, the Shaiva poet-saints such as Sambandar and Appar emerged with an optimistic, cheerful celebration of Shiva, soul and life with music and songs. This may have represented a change to the earlier ethos of Tamil society. This evolution is embedded in the mythohistory of Shaiva legends, which accuse Jain monks of scheming and torturing Sambandar, Appar and others, followed by a reversal. These legends, states Richard Davis, are better studied as symbolic conflict of ideas, a competition for patronage and transformation of Tamil social ethos through a Brahmin-peasant alliance. The Shaiva literature and songs characterize Jain monks and their ascetic lifestyle as false doctrines with no emotional or spiritual value in this or the next life. They offer a new vision to the Tamil society and culture where devotion to Shiva temple, community and loving engagement to life is the path to liberation.

==Translation of Sambandar hymns==
Francis Kingsbury and Godfrey Phillips selected and translated 24 out of 383 of Sambandar&#x27;s hymns into English in 1921. These were published with a small collection of Appar and Sundarar hymns in a book titled &quot;Hymns of the Tamil Śaivite Saints&quot;, released by the Oxford University Press. They stated that these were some of the hymns from &quot;Devaram&quot; (Tevaram) that they could hear being chanted in South Indian Shiva temples of their times.

Indira Peterson has published a more recent translation of many of Sambandar&#x27;s hymns.

<text>Monsieur N. is a 2003 British-French film directed by Antoine de Caunes. It tells the story of the last years of the life of the Emperor Napoleon (played by Philippe Torreton), who was imprisoned by the British on St Helena. Napoléon retained a loyal entourage of officers who helped him plot his escape, and evaded the attentions of Major-General Sir Hudson Lowe (Richard E. Grant), the island&#x27;s overzealous Governor.

The film suggests that Napoléon could have escaped to Louisiana, where he died, and that the body exhumed and now at Les Invalides is that of Napoléon&#x27;s officer Cipriani. The film also suggests that Napoléon and his young new English wife, Betsy Balcombe, could have attended the ceremony of &quot;Napoléon&#x27;s&quot; burial in the Invalides.

==Plot==
Napoleon, Emperor of the French is imprisoned on the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic Ocean. Here he, ostensibly, dreams of how to escape from his captivity in his last &quot;battle&quot;.

In essence, the story is as convoluted as any of the escape myths that have surfaced at various times. There is plenty of intrigue around the former Emperor, with the poisoning of a trusted aide, the possible double-cross of a trusted officer, the frivolous relationship with a gold-digger lady of the entourage and the role of governor of Saint Helena, Hudson Lowe. 

All this is witnessed and narrated through a British officer tasked with shadowing Napoleon until the final twist of the plot is revealed. 
==Reception==
The film was well received. , 71% of the 21 reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes are positive, with an average rating of 6.27/10. The website&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;Fueled by performances as polished as its visuals, &quot;Monsieur N.&quot; is a flawed yet largely absorbing look at an imagined chapter of Napoleon&#x27;s exile.&quot;

The film received a positive but guarded review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which praised Philippe Torreton&#x27;s performance but thought the narrative too complex for an audience not initiated in Napoléon&#x27;s history.

<text>The iQue Player (, stylised as iQue &quot;PLAYER) is a [[handheld TV game]] version of the [[Nintendo 64]] console that was manufactured by [[iQue]], a [[joint venture]] between [[Nintendo]] and [[Taiwanese in America|Taiwanese-American]] scientist [[Wei Yen]] after China had banned the sale of home video games. Its [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name is Shén Yóu Ji&quot; (), literally &quot;God Gaming Machine&quot;. &quot;Shényóu&quot; () is a double entendre as &quot;to make a mental journey&quot;. It was never released in any English-speaking countries, but the name &quot;iQue Player&quot; appears in the instruction manual. The console and its controller are one unit, plugging directly into the television. A box accessory allows multiplayer gaming.

==History==
===Development===
China has a large black market for video games and usually only a few games officially make it to the Chinese market. Many Chinese gamers tend to purchase pirated cartridge or disc copies or download copied game files to play via emulator. Nintendo wanted to curb software piracy in China, and bypass the ban that the Chinese government has implemented on home game consoles since 2000. Nintendo partnered with Wei Yen, who had led past Nintendo product development such as the Nintendo 64 console and later the Wii Remote. Originally, the system would support games released on Nintendo consoles prior to the GameCube, including the NES, Super NES, and Nintendo 64, but it was decided only to include Nintendo 64 games. Additionally, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; was planned and is shown on the back of the box, but was later cancelled.

The iQue Player was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2003. It was originally planned to play Super NES in addition to Nintendo 64 games, and had a release date set for mid-October with debut markets including Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu, expanding into the rest of China by the following spring. The system missed its mid-October launch. By November 21, it was available for purchase at Lik Sang.

===Release===
The iQue Player was released on November 18, 2003 with few launch games. Nintendo&#x27;s strategy to market games in China was to show how video games can help improve children&#x27;s mental and social development. However, the launch was not successful. The total estimated sales was between 8,000 and 12,000 units. At first, the only way to get games was via the iQue Depot, but in 2004, Nintendo released iQue@Home to download at home. The last game, &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; (动物森林, &quot;Animal Forest&quot;) was released in 2006.

=== Discontinuation===
On October 31, 2016, iQue reported that iQue@Home service would be discontinued by the end of December 2016. The service was gradually phased out until the content distribution servers went offline in 2018.

===Technical details===

The iQue Player is a size-reduced Nintendo 64 console, using system-on-a-chip technology. It plays Nintendo 64 games specifically ported to the system.

* Processor: MIPS R-4300i 64-bit CPU, 140.625 MHz
* Memory: 16 MB DDR (8 MB available)
* Graphics: 100,000 polygons/second, 2.09 million colors
* Sound: ADPCM 64

===Games===
The iQue Player&#x27;s library has 14 games, light conversions from past releases for the Nintendo 64 in Europe, North America, and Japan. One game was canceled, &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Majora&#x27;s Mask&quot; and another, a Traditional Chinese version of &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot;, was completed but never announced.

iQue Player games differ slightly from their Nintendo 64 counterparts, with the text and voices having been translated to Mandarin. The only exceptions are the &quot;Mario&quot; games and the previously Japan-only &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot;, where the text has been translated but the voices remain in English. Many glitches and errors from the original games have been fixed. Some features were removed due to the system&#x27;s lack of support for Nintendo 64 controller accessories like the Rumble Pak. Some features were added, and many games that allow the player to enter their name now have the option to use their iQue Player&#x27;s username. Speedruns of several games, such as &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, are sometimes carried out on the iQue Player due to quicker loading times and faster scrolling text than the Nintendo 64 versions.
Nintendo had plans to support network multiplayer in games that originally only support local multiplayer, which would work in a similar manner to that of an emulator.

<text>2072 Kosmodemyanskaya, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 6 kilometers in diameter.

The asteroid was discovered on 31 August 1973, by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, Nauchnyj, on the Crimean peninsula. It was named after Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya, mother of Soviet heroes Zoya and Aleksandr.

== Classification and orbit ==

&quot;Kosmodemyanskaya&quot; orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.1–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,402 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic.

The asteroid was first identified as at Turku Observatory in 1944. Its first used observation is a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in 1956, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by 17 years prior to the official discovery observation at Nauchnyj.

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Kosmodemyanskaya&quot; has been characterized as a stony S-type asteroid.

=== Lightcurves ===

The first rotational lightcurve was obtained by American astronomer Richard P. Binzel during a photometric survey of small main-belt asteroids in the 1980s. It showed a rotation period of 4.4 hours with a brightness variation of 0.09 magnitude (). In November 2004, another lightcurve of &quot;Kosmodemyanskaya&quot; was obtained by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi. Lightcurve analysis gave a period of 10 hours with an amplitude of 0.05 magnitude ().

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Kosmodemyanskaya&quot; measures 4.843 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an exceptionally high albedo of 0.522, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 8.93 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.61.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in memory of social worker Lyubov Kosmodemyanskaya (1900–1978), mother of Soviet heroes Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and Aleksandr Kosmodemyansky. The minor planets 1793 Zoya and 1977 Shura, pet name for &quot;Aleksandr&quot;, were named after the two. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 April 1980 ().

<text>Sancti Spíritus () is a municipality and capital city of the province of Sancti Spíritus in central Cuba and one of the oldest Cuban European settlements. Sancti Spíritus is the genitive case of Latin &quot;Sanctus Spiritus&quot; (&quot;Holy Spirit&quot;).

==History==

The city was founded by Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar in 1514.

The city contributed men for Hernán Cortés&#x27; 1518 expedition to Mexico, including Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero, Gonzalo de Sandoval, and Juan Velazquez de Leon.

Francisco Iznaga, a Basque landowner in the western portion of Cuba during the first thirty years of the colonization of Cuba, was elected mayor of Bayamo in 1540. Iznaga was the originator of a powerful lineage which finally settled in Sancti Spíritus and Trinidad, where Torre Iznaga (Iznaga Tower) is. His descendants fought for the independence of Cuba and for annexation to the U.S., from 1820 to 1900.

==Geography==

The municipality is divided into the barrios of Banao, Bellamota, Bijabo, Guasimal, Hospital, Jíbaro, Manacas, Mapos, Paredes, Paula, Pelayo, Pueblo Nuevo, San Andrés, Tuinicú, Tunas de Zaza and Zaza del Medio.

The Zaza Reservoir is located southwest of the city.

The city has a central park which is a place of great entertainment for the persons of all ages.

The geographic center of Cuba is located off the shores of the municipality.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Sancti Spíritus has a tropical savanna climate, abbreviated &quot;Aw&quot; on climate maps.
==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Sancti Spíritus had a population of 142,618. With a total area of , this means a population density of .

==Main sights==
The Iglesia Parroquial Mayor del Espíritu Santo is located two blocks south of the town&#x27;s main square; it is a venerable green-towered church whose early 16th-century origins make it the country&#x27;s oldest. Nearby is the Museo de Arte Colonial &quot;(Colonial Art Museum)&quot;, one of Sancti Spíritus&#x27;s most attractive colonial homes and a standout attraction. The opulent former palatial mansion of the Valle Iznaga clan, one of Cuba&#x27;s most elite families who fled Cuba after Fidel&#x27;s Revolution, it became the property of the state in 1961. Ninety percent of what you see inside, from furniture to paintings, is original. Though the family obviously kept an impressive collection of Limoges porcelain, French gilded mirrors, Italian marble tables, and Baccarat crystal chandeliers here, it wasn&#x27;t their primary residence; the house was used mostly to host family members in transit, so the furnishings were rather eclectic. The three bedrooms are decorated in grand style, though, with handmade lace, embroidered sheets, and hand-painted glass. There is a gorgeous and very Cuban leather &quot;sillón fumador&quot; (smoking chair) and, in the music room, the mid-18th-century American piano, one of only two of its type in Cuba. In the tearoom is the family seal, which says: &quot;El que más vale no vale tanto como Valle vale&quot; (&quot;He who has the greatest worth isn&#x27;t worth as much as a Valle is worth&quot;—playing off the Spanish word for &quot;worth&quot; with the family surname).

Another interesting landmark is one of Cuba&#x27;s older bridges over the Yayabo river. Built in 1815 with clay bricks it forms five arcs, the center being 9 meters tall. The entire bridge is only 85 meters long and was designed for pedestrians and carriages during colonial-era Cuba but has thus far resisted heavier modern traffic.

Sancti Spíritus has a famous Medical University located at the Main road in Olivos III. It has students from all over the world representing 34 nationalities. The university is affiliated with ELAM in Havana.

==Transport==
The city is crossed in the middle by the Carretera Central (CC), the Cuban principal highway spanning the length of the island. It is also served by the Sancti Spíritus Airport and by the A1 motorway, at the exit &quot;Sancti Spíritus-Yaguajay&quot;, located near Guayos.

It counts a railway station on Cabaiguán-Sancti Spíritus-Tunas de Zaza line, with express trains from/to Havana, a terminal for interprovincial omnibuses and an urban bus service.

==Sport==
The local baseball team is the Sancti Spíritus Gallos, and its home ground is José Antonio Huelga Stadium. The local football team is the FC Sancti Spíritus.

==Education==
The Facultad de Ciencias Medicas Sancti Spiritus is a medical school located in Sancti Spíritus.

<doc id="1102174" wikidata="Q5133095" url="?curid=1102174" title="Cliffs Pavilion">
<text>Cliffs Pavilion (locally known as the Cliffs) is a theatre, sports, exhibition and concert venue located on Station Road in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex, England, a suburb within the city of Southend-on-Sea. It is the largest purpose-built arts venue in Essex, and the largest capacity of any theatre in the East of England. In 2006, the operation of Cliffs Pavilion, along with the Palace Theatre, were handed to HQ Theatres by Southend-on-Sea Borough Council. HQ Theatres merged with Trafalgar Entertainment in 2021. In February 2022, the Cliffs played host to &quot;He Built This City concert&quot;, a tribute to the murdered MP for Southend West Sir David Amess.

== The buildings history ==
===Early history===
Plans for a theatre, the Shorefield Pavilion, on the site started in 1935 when the borough council purchased the location to build a 500-seat theatre and concert venue, with work starting four years later on construction but was suspended by the outbreak of World War II. After the war, the site was known as Southend&#x27;s white elephant, with the site laying empty due to budget constraints, until 1963, when work was started on a building that could host shows, concerts and private functions. The building was designed by the borough architect Patrick Burridge, who also designed Southend Civic Centre. The 1,100 capacity theatre was opened by the actor, writer and director Sir Bernard Miles in July 1964, with the first show opening the next day starring Norman Vaughan and his troupe of dancers, the Swinging Lovelies. The hexagonal sunken forecourt that was at the front of the theatre (prior to the 2024/25 refurbishment) followed the line of the pre-war foundations. The theatre won a commendation at the &quot;Come to Britain&quot; awards held by the British Travel &amp; Holiday Association 
in the same year. The Cliffs was the venue for the annual &quot;Southend-on-Sea Festival of Music and the Arts&quot;.
===1990s redevelopment and 2000s refurbishment===
From July 1991 to December 1992, the building was closed to be re-developed and enlarged, with funding from Southend Borough Council and was designed by Tim Foster Architects. The stairs were rebuilt, a new Foyer Bar added and a balcony added to the auditorium increasing the capacity to 1,630. The new extension was completed in an Art Deco style. The total cost for the redevelopment was £3.4 million. The theatre re-opened with the pantomime &quot;The Pied Piper of Hamelin&quot; starring Wayne Sleep, Peggy Mount and Richard Marner. The refurbished Cliffs Pavilion received a Civic Design Award in 1993.

In 1998, the Arts Council allocated £850,000 of Lottery cash to Southend Borough Council to investigate a £20 million stage 2 redevelopment. The plans included building a new raked seating stall area, reducing the capacity to 1,601 seats, and a new stage house with dimensions for the stage and fly tower meeting the minimum requirements for major touring companies - an increase in the maximum height from 19 metres to 29 metres. The council brought in Levitt Bernstein Associates to oversee the design, however in 1999 the bid for £12 million of Lottery funding from the Arts Council was overlooked and stage 2 of the redevelopment was withdrawn.

In 2010, the Cliffs was closed for seven weeks while a refurbishment took place. The theatre&#x27;s 1,630 seats that had been in the venue since the 1991-92 redevelopment were replaced, while the carpets in the Foyer were changed.

===Pavilion refurbishment 2024-2025 ===
It was announced in November 2021 that the operator, Trafalgar Theatres and owner, Southend-on-Sea City Council had applied for planning permission for a major refurbishment of the Cliffs Pavilion costing £8 million, with £5.5 million provided by the UK government through the Levelling Up fund. The plan would see extensive improvements, with a major expansion of the restaurant, a new entrance and lobby to improve the customer experience, an upgraded ventilation system, a new outdoor piazza, bars, toilets, changing facilities and lifts. The redevelopment was due to begin in early 2024, with the building works to be completed by contractor Willmott Dixon, and were planned to take a year to complete. The Cliffs managers said the venue would remain open throughout the refurbishments. However, by February 2024, it was announced that there would be a delay to the start of the refurbishment works as the price had risen above the original cost. It was announced in August 2024 that work was due to start later that month, with Auburn Group awarded the contract after a recommissioning of the tender process. Work officially started on the 22 August.

== Maritime Room ==
The Maritime Room is a smaller venue than the main theatre, and is located on the lower level. The venue was originally opened as a restaurant, but after a short trial negotiated by local musician Peter Morris, the venue was used for jazz music events, before expanding into country and western. From 1986 until 2014, the venue was home to the Joker Comedy Club, and it was at the club that local boy Lee Evans started his comedy career. The club hosted Frank Skinner, Stewart Lee and Bob Mills among others. Jazz remains a staple, with both the Jazz Mix and Open Mic club nights taking place at the venue. The venue is currently home to the Balls Out Comedy Club as well as Tropicana 80s nights.

== Performances at the Cliffs ==
The Cliffs has been the venue for a mixture of music, variety and theatrical shows, hosting some of the biggest names in entertainment since it opened in 1964. Here is a selection of notable performances:

*Micky Flanagan performed at the Cliffs in May 2011, which was recorded for his DVD &quot;The Out Out Tour&quot;. Flanagan opened the show saying, &quot;The tour people, they asked me. They said, Mick, where do you want to go for the DVD. Do you want to go East? Do you want to go West? And I said I want to go to Essex! The only way is Essex!&quot;.
*After the closure for the COVID pandemic, Jimmy Carr filmed his Netflix special &quot;His Dark Material&quot; as the first show at the re-opened venue.

<doc id="1102176" wikidata="Q748155" url="?curid=1102176" title="Anthem of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic">
<text>The State Anthem of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic was the anthem of Kazakhstan when it was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.

==Background==
The music was composed by Mukan Tölebaev, Russian composer Yevgeny Brusilovsky and Tatar composer Latıf Hamıdı, with lyrics written by Kazakh authors Äbdilda Täjibaev, Qaiym Muhamedhanov and Ğabıt Müsirepov. The Soviet-era lyrics were removed after the Kazakh SSR was renamed the Republic of Kazakhstan on 10 December 1991, In 1992, new lyrics were adopted with the same melody as the anthem of independent Kazakhstan, until 7 January 2006.

From 1991 to 1997, it was one of the five remaining republics that appreciated its old anthem, then from 1997 to 2000, it became one of four (when Turkmenistan changed its anthem). From 2000 to 2006, it is one of the five remaining again (when Russia changed its anthem). It is the only SSR anthem played in , with the majority of others using .

==Lyrics==
After Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev then came into power and established nation-wide de-Stalinisation policies. The lyrics of the State Anthem of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic would later be revised, per de-Stalinisation.

In the last line of the final stanza in the lyrics, the word () would be replaced with () – in reference to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the official ruling party of the Soviet Union.

<doc id="1102177" wikidata="Q1077630" url="?curid=1102177" title="Septinsular Republic">
<text>The Septinsular Republic (; ), also known as the Republic of the Seven United Islands, was an oligarchic republic that existed from 1800 to 1807 under nominal Russian and Ottoman sovereignty in the Ionian Islands (Corfu, Paxoi, Lefkada, Cephalonia, Ithaca, Zakynthos or Zante, and Kythira).

The Republic was established after a joint Russo-Ottoman fleet captured the islands and ended a two-year rule by the French Republic. Although the islanders had hoped for complete independence, the new state was granted only autonomy, becoming tributary to the Ottoman Porte, and de facto under Russian domination. Nevertheless, it was the first time that Greeks had been granted self-government since the fall of the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire to the Ottomans in the mid-15th century. In 1807, the republic was ceded to Napoleon&#x27;s French Empire, but the islands kept their institutions of government. The British gradually took control of the islands from 1809 on, and following the Treaty of Paris, the islands were formally organised into the United States of the Ionian Islands under British protection.

== Background: French rule and Russian conquest of the Ionian Islands ==

The Ionian Islands (Corfu, Paxoi, Zakynthos or Zante, Kefalonia, Lefkada, Ithaca, and Kythira or Cerigo) along with a handful of exclaves on the Epirote mainland, namely the coastal towns of Parga, Preveza, Vonitsa, and Butrinto, had been Venetian possessions for centuries, thereby becoming the only part of the Greek world to escape conquest by the Ottoman Empire, developing a distinct local culture, and becoming a place of &quot;dynamic interaction between the West and [...] the Greek East&quot;, indeed serving as &quot;Greek culture&#x27;s window on the West&quot;, through which Western European ideas and culture were transmitted to the Greek world.

Under Venetian rule, the population of the islands was divided into three classes: the privileged nobility, the urban middle class (&quot;cittadini&quot;) and the commoners (&quot;popolari&quot;). The nobility were mostly landowners, and derided mercantile activity, which was left to the urban commercial class; as a result, the latter also came to amass wealth and land, and aspired to join the ruling class. In this contest, the rural peasantry was generally politically marginalized. This medieval social order was upset after the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, when the islands came under French control. Shortly after, in the Treaty of Campo Formio, the islands were annexed to the French Republic and organized into three departments. The Republican French were welcomed by the populace, and the radical ideas of the French Revolution were implemented with the abolition of the local nobility, the equality of the social and religious communities (Orthodox, Catholic, and Jewish) and the installation of democratic regimes and local self-government on the islands. The French also created the islands&#x27; first public education system, and introduced the first printing press in what is now Greece.

Inevitably, the French presence was resented by the local aristocracy, now deprived of its privileges, while the heavy taxation and anti-clericalism of the French soon made them unpopular with broad sections of the common populace as well. Following the French invasion of Egypt furthermore, the French presence in the Ionian Islands aroused the opposition of the Ottomans and the Russian Empire, allied with the British, as part of the War of the Second Coalition. No less than the Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, issued a proclamation to the Islanders denouncing the &quot;ungodly&quot; French, calling upon them to rise in revolt, and promising, on behalf of the Ottoman Porte, to allow the Islands to choose their own form of government. In autumn 1798, a joint Russo-Ottoman fleet evicted the French from the other islands and finally captured Corfu on , while the autonomous Ottoman strongman Ali Pasha of Yanina took the opportunity to seize Butrinto, Preveza, and Vonitsa from the French.

==Establishment of the Septinsular Republic==
===Restoration of the nobility===
In all the islands they occupied, the Russians at first installed provisional administrations of nobles and businesspeople alike. On 22 March, however, the Russian authorities invited assemblies of the nobles to undertake the governance of the Ionian Islands, thereby restoring the previous &quot;status quo&quot;. On the next day, the Great Council of Corfu was reconstituted; its very first action was a vote of thanks to the Allied rulers, the Ottoman Sultan, the Russian Emperor, and the British King. In Zakynthos, however, the local noble council preferred to direct its thanks exclusively to the British, an expression of the strong pro-British tendency on the island, due to the close commercial links centred on the currant trade.

On , the commanders of the two fleets announced that the Ionian Islands would comprise a single state, governed by a Senate () in Corfu city, composed of three representatives each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two from Lefkada, and one each from Ithaca, Kythira, and Paxoi. The Venetian nobleman Angelo Orio, the last Venetian of Argostoli, was appointed head of the Senate, and entrusted with the creation of a constitution for the new state. Orio&#x27;s draft constitution comprised 28 articles and one addendum, and envisaged a thoroughly aristocratic regime, with each island headed by a Great Council composed of the nobles and the upper bourgeoisie. The Great Councils would elect the senators. Each island would retain a local administrative council of six members and a treasury, but a central treasury would exist in Corfu. The Senate was the ultimate executive authority, and its president the head of state. A Small Council of 40 would be elected by the Great Councils of the three largest islands, and would be responsible for justice, the selection of officials, and advising on legislation. Each island&#x27;s council would have to ratify the laws passed by the Senate. In addition, the use of the Greek language was sanctioned for the first time in the courts. Ushakov also restored the Orthodox Archbishopric of Corfu, which had been abolished in the 13th century by the Angevin rulers of Corfu.

===Treaty of Constantinople===

On 21 June 1799, the Senate sent a twelve-member delegation to Constantinople and Saint Petersburg, drawn from the upper classes of each island, to express its gratitude to the Sultan and Tsar and secure recognition of the new state&#x27;s independence. The delegates were also tasked with producing a draft constitution and submitting it for ratification, as well as press for the restoration of the Islands&#x27; maritime and land frontier with the withdrawal of Ali Pasha from Butrinto, Preveza, and Vonitsa. The delegation included Orio, nominated as ambassador to St. Petersburg, and the presidency of the Senate passed to Count Spyridon Georgios Theotokis of the distinguished Theotokis family, who had previously headed the Provisional Municipality under French rule.

Once in Constantinople, however, the delegation quickly realized that the Porte was not interested in recognizing the Islands&#x27; independence, but rather in creating a vassal state under Ottoman suzerainty. Two of the delegates, the Corfiot Count Antonios Maria Kapodistrias and the Zakynthian Count Nikolaos Gradenigos Sigouros Desyllas, remained in Constantinople to conduct negotiations with the Porte, while Orio and another delegate, Kladas, were to represent the Ionian cause in Saint Petersburg. In the negotiations that followed, the Constantinople delegates were pitted against the Saint Petersburg ones in a correspondence war over the nature of the new polity.

On , the Treaty of Constantinople was concluded between Russia and the Ottomans, joined later by the British, creating the &quot;Republic of the Seven United Islands&quot; (; ), the first autonomous Greek state since the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453. According to the provisions of the treaty, the Ionian Islands would be a single federal state, with the individual islands preserving a degree of autonomy. It would follow the long-established model of the Republic of Ragusa, being an aristocratic republic led by the &quot;primates and notables&quot;, and under Ottoman suzerainty, as token of which they would pay an annual tribute of 75,000 piastres to the Sultan. This was a victory for the Sultan, and a disappointment for the Islanders, who had been promised the right to choose their own form of governance in the proclamations of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Gregory V, and the head of the Russian fleet, Admiral Fyodor Ushakov. The new state&#x27;s constitution, once agreed, would be approved by the signatory powers. As the new state lacked military forces, Russian and Ottoman forces would remain to garrison its forts and guarantee its security until the end of the war against France. The mainland exclaves of Parga, Vonitsa, Preveza, and Butrinto, on the other hand, would remain under Ottoman control but would enjoy a special status similar to that of the Danubian Principalities.

===Adoption of the &#x27;Byzantine Constitution&#x27;===
At the same time, without consulting their colleagues in Saint Petersburg or the provisional government in the Islands, Capodistrias and Sigouros Desyllas also composed a new constitution and designed the new flag of the state. The new &#x27;Byzantine Constitution&#x27; (, ) was most probably named after the city in which it was composed, Constantinople (ancient Byzantion)—although tradition derived the name from the Republic being the first free state in Greece since the fall of Constantinople. The constitution comprised 37 articles. It envisaged an aristocratic federal republic, with a local administration on every island, headed by three syndics, to be chosen annually from the Great Council of the nobles of each island. The syndics elected a dean () as head of administration for four-month tenures. The Senate in Corfu remained the highest authority of the federal state, composed of the representatives of the islands. Its president, the , was the head of state. The constitution was printed in Greek, with heavy use of Italian loanwords for administrative terms, by the patriarchal press in Constantinople.

The new constitution was strongly reactionary, reversing the gains of the bourgeoisie in particular, in favour of the old noble families; even the titles of nobility granted in 1799, after the French left, and which were mostly given to the wealthy commercial class, were rescinded, and the legislation of the abolished Venetian Republic restored. In keeping with the reactionary ideas embodied in the constitution was also the new flag, sporting the Venetian Lion of Saint Mark holding a bundle of seven arrows, symbolizing the islands, and a Bible; suggestions with more revolutionary overtones, such as the rising phoenix, were rejected. On 1 November 1800, the new constitution and flag were formally sanctioned by the Grand Vizier and blessed by the Patriarch in Constantinople. The Ionian envoys to St. Petersburg, Orio and Kladas, protested to the Tsar about the events in Constantinople, but in vain; Theotokis, who now was recognized as head of state with the title of prince, even dismissed Orio from his position.

==Political turmoil and secessionist movements, 1800–1801==

On 26 December 1800, the two envoys to Constantinople arrived in Corfu as &#x27;Imperial Commissioners&#x27;, i.e., the Sultan&#x27;s representatives in the islands, with the task of overseeing the implementation of the &#x27;Byzantine Constitution&#x27;. On , the flag of the Septinsular Republic was formally raised at Corfu.

The mission of the Imperial Commissioners—Antonio Maria Capo d&#x27;Istria was soon replaced by his son, Ioannis Kapodistrias, the future first governor of Greece—quickly proved problematic: the reactionary nature of the new constitution, which limited political power to the nobility, immediately made it controversial, as the common people had grown used to the greater civic rights and liberties enjoyed during the French Republican rule. To this were added local grievances and power struggles, which resulted in secessionist tendencies in some islands.

Already during the latter part of 1799, political tensions had led to the start of infighting, both among the nobility, as well as between the nobility and the other classes. While at Corfu, under the direct supervision of Ushakov, the elections of the new provisional authorities and their installation were orderly and peaceful, that was not the case in the other islands. Class and personal rivalries dominated the process there, and the arbitrary interventions of Ushakov&#x27;s representative, Nikolai Tiesenhausen. In Zakynthos, for example, a plot was hatched to murder the nobles on 12 September 1799, the day the island&#x27;s Great Council was to convene and elect the new government. While the plot was not carried out, its instigator, Antonio Martinengo, managed to bribe Tiesenhausen and secure an amnesty, whereas his co-conspirator Tsintos was shot. Due to the restiveness of the rural population, on 18 January 1800, the first repressive measures against the lower classes were announced.

===Rebellions in Cephalonia===
The mounting political passions came first to a head in Cephalonia, where the existence of a large middle class increased dissatisfaction with the reactionary local government. To this was joined the rivalry between the island&#x27;s capital, Argostoli, and the town of Lixouri, and between the noble families of Metaxas and Anninos.

On 24 August 1800 an armed mob of civilians and rebel soldiers seized the government house in Argostoli, as well as ransacking and destroying the houses and villas of the administration members. A new government was formed on 9 September, but only after Count Konstantinos Chorafas was given plenipotentiary powers and a force of Russian troops, the unrest was suppressed. This peace did not last long, and a revolt under the nobleman Efstathios Metaxas broke out in May 1801. In response, the Imperial Commissioners came to the island to mediate in the conflict and established a 22-member Committee of Public Safety, with themselves and Colonel Nikolaos Pierris as chairmen. In the end Metaxas&#x27; revolt was subdued by a compromise reached by Ioannis Kapodistrias: the previous government of the island resigned on 20 May, and the Commissioners along with the Committee of Public Safety took over the island&#x27;s governance, with the aim of pacifying the island and disarming the inhabitants.

Local passions hindered their work, however: in late May, the delegation of Lixouri withdrew from the committee and the Lixouriotes made threatening moves against Argostoli, forcing the Imperial Commissioners to visit Lixouri in person to calm matters. At the same time, the brothers Andreas and Kaisar Metaxas refused to acknowledge the Committee of Public Safety and rose in revolt, which was only suppressed after heavy combats on 15 June: Andreas surrendered, but Kaisar fled to Corfu. In the meantime, Lixouri had voted for secession from the Argostoli-based government, and sent envoys to Corfu demanding a separate administration for the town; at the same time, the dissatisfied peasants of Anogi also rebelled and began attacking Lixouri, until troops sent by the Committee of Public Safety clashed with them and drove them back.

In order to restore order, the Imperial Commissioners convened the island&#x27;s Great Council on 20 July, which according to the constitution elected the three syndics, the three senators-representatives and the other public officials. In all cases, the offices were equally apportioned among representatives of the island&#x27;s three towns, Argostoli, Lixouri, and St. George&#x27;s Castle. After this was done, on 27 July the Imperial Commissioners felt able to proclaim the successful establishment of lawful government on the island. This proved premature, for in August, the peasantry around Lixouri rebelled, seized the town, and expelled the government garrison. Kapodistrias and Andreas Panas tried to mediate a settlement, but the rebels, backed by the local Austrian vice-consul, refused.

===Secessionist movements in Zakynthos and Ithaca===

Similar unrest also broke out in Kythira, where rioting peasants attacked the nobles and merchants before troops restored order, and in Lefkada.

On Zakynthos, the turmoil continued, with constant clashes between rival groups and coalitions. While the central government planned a coup, another, pro-British coup broke out first. On 20 February 1801, Zakynthos seceded from the Republic, raising the British flag instead, apparently with the support of a supposed British colonel, a certain James Kallender, who happened to be on the island and became its military governor. The initiative was quickly denounced by the British ambassador to the Porte, the Earl of Elgin, but constitutional order was not restored until five Ottoman vessels and a British warship arrived before the island on 12 September 1801.

A similar secessionist movement also briefly took hold of Ithaca, where the local government entertained contacts with Zakynthos. When the Imperial Commissioners arrived on 18 August on the island with the intention of installing a constitutionally-based administration, the local government resigned. Pro-British sentiments were limited to the capital of Vathy, however, while the rural population supported the Commissioners&#x27; efforts.

===Departure of the Russo–Ottoman troops and the &quot;Honourable Deputation&quot;===
Even Corfu was not spared unrest: on , bloody riots broke out due to the arrogant behaviour of armed Ottoman soldiers in the city. With its own troops unable to contain the situation—most of the available forces had been shipped to Cephalonia—the Senate handed over authority to the Russians, under Lt. Colonel Karl Hastfert, so as to prevent a general massacre and restore order. The Russian intervention calmed the situation, but the Senate requested that the Ottomans remove their troops from the island. Conversely, when the Russians announced their intention of removing their own troops, the Senate president Theotokis implored the Russian to remain and ensure the islands&#x27; domestic tranquility and external security. Nevertheless, on 25 August 1801, the occupying powers officially handed over control of the fortresses and departed.

This act seriously undermined the stability of the government, whose repressive measures only alienated the middle class and peasantry further. By this time, the city of Corfu was virtually under siege by the rural population, which ransacked the nobility&#x27;s country estates. While the Senate became increasingly powerless, power increasingly shifted to a group of the commercial class (Spyridon Delviniotis, Karolos Manesis, and Alexandros Avgoustos Kogevinas) who maintained contacts with the peasantry.

To counter the restiveness of the populace, and the increasing demands for civic rights, the Senate gave Theotokis dictatorial powers. Theotokis formed an &#x27;Extraordinary Committee of Public Safety&#x27; () composed of Dimitrios Armenos, Stamos Chalikiopoulos, and Ioannis Kapadokas, but the rebellious lower classes refused to accept its authority. Instead the middle class and peasants elected their own delegates, resulting in the formation of a body of 64 men, the &#x27;Honourable Deputation of the City, Boroughs, and Villages of Corfu&#x27; (), which declared the 1800 constitution as void, and began drafting a new, more democratic constitution.

The constitution proposed by the &#x27;Honourable Deputation&#x27; vested sovereign power in Corfu in a 240-member council of &#x27;Best Ones&#x27;, elected for life in general, albeit indirect, suffrage. 100 members would come from the city, with 40 noblemen, 40 entrepreneurs, 14 merchants, and 6 artisans; the rest of the members would come from the countryside. Executive power was vested in a committee of four , who were elected from among the &#x27;Best Ones&#x27; and chaired its proceedings. The council decided on all matters, and also elected the three representatives of the island to the Ionian Senate, which was intended to retain its original functions. The definition of nobility, and with it suffrage, was broadened to all those who had an income of 1,000 thalers, regardless of residence or profession.

Events proceeded quickly: the draft constitution was sent to the Senate on 21 October 1801, and ten days later, the &#x27;Honourable Deputation&#x27; demanded from Theotokis to appoint representatives of the nobility to form a common provisional government for Corfu. In a highly symbolic display of unity and class reconciliation, on 28 November the &#x27;Honourable Deputation&#x27; joined with 14 representatives of the &quot;so-called nobility&quot;, as they were termed, to take over power; on the next day, the nobles signed the new constitution.

==Foreign intervention and the oligarchic constitution of 1803==
The new regime of Corfu was not welcome to the Allied powers of the Second Coalition, nor to the noble-dominated Senate: in early March 1802, on the invitation of Theotokis, a British force landed on Corfu and joined with the troops of the Republic. The Ottomans also disapproved of events, although they recognized the necessity of reforms to the original constitution. The Porte charged Theotokis, who remained president of the Senate, to restore the previous status quo, until proper deliberations involving the Allied powers, the Imperial Commissioners, and the islanders could take place. The rural population was on the point of marching on Corfu city, but the warnings of the Ottomans to the &#x27;Honourable Deputation&#x27;, and the French consul, Romieu, who addressed the peasants, temporarily calmed matters.

With the situation still volatile, the Russians secured the agreement of the other Great Powers to send their own troops to the islands, with the Zakynthian count Giorgio Mocenigo, a former Russian ambassador to Florence and briefly the Septinsular Republic&#x27;s envoy to St. Petersburg, as the Tsar&#x27;s plenipotentiary. In the meantime, the Treaty of Amiens led to the formal recognition of the Republic, as constituted in the Treaty of Constantinople, by France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the Batavian Republic.

===Arrival and reforms of Giorgio Mocenigo===
Mocenigo arrived at Corfu on 1 September 1802, with five Russian vessels and 1,600 troops. In the meantime, the proposals of the &#x27;Honourable Deputation&#x27; had been rejected, and only the presence of the British troops kept its supporters out of Corfu city.

In this atmosphere, Mocenigo&#x27;s arrival was welcomed by both sides: the nobles felt that he would support their authority, while the lower classes hoped that he would liberate them from it. Indeed, Mocenigo immediately began to reform the institutions of the Republic, by limiting the power of the nobles as well as the autonomy of the individual islands. Mocenigo established a new provisional government or &#x27;regency&#x27; () in each island, where executive power was concentrated in the hands of a regent (), who in all cases had to come from a different island, but was assisted by two deputies chosen by him from the island&#x27;s population. While Theotokis, who was able to work well with Mocenigo, remained as President of the Senate (and thus titulary head of state), the existing Senate was dissolved on 30 December 1802, and a provisional Senate appointed by Mocenigo, to general dissatisfaction. The new regime was quick to stamp out any sign of dissent or rebellion, and pro-French sentiment was frowned upon, particularly after the positive reception of a speech by the French general Sebastiani at Zakynthos.

On 3 February 1803, the provisional Senate announced the creation of new electoral colleges, the so-called , replacing the old councils of the nobility. Nevertheless, membership to these was restricted by a series of property, citizenship, religious, and professional qualifications, so that they had a pronounced oligarchic character. These in turn elected a 40-member legislative body (), with ten members each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, four from Lefkada, two each from Ithaca and Kythira and one from Paxoi) and a seventeen-member Senate (with four members each from Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two from Lefkada, and one each from the other islands). The new Senate appointed Ioannis Kapodistrias as Secretary of State.

===Constitution of 1803===

On 26 October, the Constitutional Assembly convened, which on 5 December 1803 passed the new constitution of the Republic. Its 212 articles were a mixture of progressive principles and restrictions on political rights that ensured the oligarchic nature of the state. While the Venetian-era hereditary nobility was abolished, a new civic aristocracy (&#x27;constitutional nobility&#x27;) took its place. Based on property or academic qualifications, it was composed of many former nobles as well as businesspeople. This new aristocracy formed the electorate for the , which continued to elect the Senate and the legislative body as before.

The Constitution of 1803 introduced the principle of separation of powers, and instituted a new body, the censors () who were to safeguard compliance to the Constitution and function as advisors to the Senate. The Senate remained the main executive body, with three branches for foreign affairs, interior and finance affairs, and military affairs. Each island retained its own government for the time being, headed by a dean or rector (), while his two deputies were now named regents (). Among the progressive elements of the new constitution were the institution of juries, personal liberties, the inviolability of a citizen&#x27;s home, and religious tolerance. The constitution also contained a clause (Article 211) that made knowledge of the Greek language mandatory for any candidate for public office after 1810, while from 1820 on all public documents were to be exclusively in Greek.

The new constitution went into force on 27 December, when the Metropolitan of Corfu blessed it and the president of the Constitutional Assembly and deputy president of the Senate took their oaths on it. With Theotokis having died on 24 November, a new president of the Senate and head of state of the Republic was elected; Antonios Komoutos from Zakynthos. The following period saw a flurry of legislative and administrative activity: between January and March 1804, laws concerning local administration, shipping, rural communes, and education were passed, the ecclesiastical administration was reformed, and the ministries were established. The Republic now became truly a proper state, and aroused the expectations and hopes of the Greek intelligentsia: Adamantios Korais and Eugenios Voulgaris dedicated their works to the Republic.

Nevertheless, due to the machinations of Mocenigo, the Russians never ratified the new constitution. Furthermore, as the Russian plenipotentiary, Mocenigo was the most influential person in the state, with a decisive voice in all matters, and soon began to undermine the constitution by creating extraordinary committees, bypassing the ordinary courts, and establishing a &#x27;Sublime Police&#x27;, staffed by his own nominees and controlled by him.

==Relations with Ali Pasha, the Souliots, and the creation of the Greek Legion==
Relations between the Republic and its neighbour Ali Pasha were tense and complicated. The Ionian Islands, and especially Lefkada, were a common refuge for klephts and brigands fleeing the Ottoman authorities of the Greek mainland. With the Islands as a secure base, they often launched raids on the Turkish-held shores. In turn, Ali Pasha harassed the Republic&#x27;s citizens, and imposed heavy tolls on its vessels in the harbours he controlled.

During this period, Ali Pasha in a series of campaigns suppressed the rebellious Souliots, who defied his authority. Advised by the turncoat Georgios Botsaris, Ali pursued a strategy of encircling the area of Souli with forts and besieging it. Already in 1800, the Souliots wrote to Theotokis for aid against the designs of Ali Pasha. The latter in turn threatened the inhabitants of Parga, to prevent them from lending any aid to the Souliots. By 1803, the position of the Souliots had grown dire, and they implored the Septinsular Republic for ammunition. A Souliot embassy visited Mocenigo, conveying an appeal to Tsar Alexander. Mocenigo gave them some ammunition, but secretly from the Russians; this and later requests for Russian mediation remained unanswered, even as Ali Pasha, with the Sultan&#x27;s backing, moved to eradicate the last centres of Souliot resistance. The Souliots who managed to escape from Ali&#x27;s forces made for Parga, but they were forced to cross the sea to the Septinsular Republic in March 1804, after Ali Pasha threatened to attack the city. In November 1803, the Republic signed a treaty with Ali Pasha, who was represented by the Metropolitan of Nafpaktos Ignatios.
Approximately 3,000 Souliotes settled in the Ionian Islands, mostly in Corfu and Paxoi, where they were provided with farmland. The warlike Souliotes struggled to fit in their new environment, stealing cattle and firewood from local residents and lamenting the loss of their homeland. Anxious to expand its influence to the Greek mainland, Russia signed alliances with Himariot and Cham Albanian beys on 27 June 1804. Souliot refugees were mobilized for an offensive, which was cut short when Ali Pasha learned of the Russian plans and an Ottoman naval squadron made an unexpected appearance off Corfu.

As French–Ottoman relations began to warm in 1805, the Russians began raising native military formations for the defence of the Ionian Islands, enrolling Souliots, Himariots, Acarnanians, and Moreots into the so-called &#x27;Greek Legion&#x27;, which was placed under the command of the Greek-born Major General Emmanouil Papadopoulos. In autumn 1805 the Greek Legion participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Naples, and in 1806 it fought against the French at the Bay of Kotor.

==&quot;Russian&quot; Constitution of 1806==
Mocenigo&#x27;s influence became decisive in the run-up to the revision of the 1803 constitution, scheduled for 1806. On Mocenigo&#x27;s suggestion, the Senate instituted a &#x27;Decemvirate&#x27; () to study the changes to the constitution; in the end, the council&#x27;s suggestions reflected Mocenigo&#x27;s designs. When the were convened to elect their representatives to the Constitutional Assembly on 13 September 1806, they turned into a sham: Mocenigo sent an envoy to every island with prepared lists of the representatives to be elected. Finally, when the Constitutional Assembly convened on 27 October, Mocenigo simply replaced the entire Legislative Council, which was to prepare the lists of the candidates for public office, with his own choices, and appointed Ioannis Kapodistrias as its secretary and rapporteur. Kapodistrias presented the draft constitution to the Constitutional Assembly on 22 December. These moves aroused considerable opposition, but Kapodistrias successfully argued that there was no alternative that would enjoy the consent of St. Petersburg, and the new constitution was approved five days later.

The new constitution vested sovereignty in the so-called &#x27;active nobility&#x27;, determined by income and academic titles. This restriction actually resulted in the exclusion some of the old noble families, that had become impoverished in the meantime. A Legislative Senate of 17 members (four each for Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, two for Lefkada, and one each for the minor islands), of whom nine served for three years and eight for four, was given legislative authority, while executive authority was vested in a five-member college, the . The members, known as the &#x27;heads of the republic&#x27; (), came one each from the three major islands of Corfu, Cephalonia, and Zakynthos, while the fourth came either from the three islands or from Lefkada, and the fifth either from Lefkada or from the minor islands. The had a rotating presidency, with a tenure of one year; for that year, the president was also the head of state and prince of the Republic. The further appointed the four ministers: for foreign affairs, war and naval affairs, interior affairs, finances and justice. The local governments of the islands were not changed, but the constitution of 1806 abolished many of the more progressive and liberal clauses of its predecessor. Above all, it effectively abolished the Republic&#x27;s autonomy by recognizing the right of Russia to intervene in its domestic and foreign affairs.

It is still debated among historians whether the revisions incorporated in the 1806 constitution reflected an initiative of the Russian government, or whether it was driven by a small coterie of men around Mocenigo, aiming to concentrate power in fewer hands. Nevertheless, the &#x27;Russian Constitution&#x27;, as it soon became known, strongly reinforced the position of Russia and the pro-Russian elements in the Republic, arousing the suspicions of France.

==Russo-Turkish War and the end of the Republic==

In the meantime, the shifting alliances in Europe impacted the Republic as well, with Ottoman Turkey drifting away from Russia, and towards France. On 6 January 1807, the Ottoman Porte notified the Republic of the declaration of war with Russia. As &quot;de jure&quot; the Republic was an Ottoman vassal, the Porte demanded the Ionian Islands&#x27; adherence to the Ottoman camp against Russia. France followed by recalling its envoy and terminating its diplomatic relations with the Republic. Under Mocenigo&#x27;s tutelage, the Ionian Senate on 17 June 1807 declared the end of the Republic&#x27;s neutrality towards France, effectively bringing the islands into the War of the Fourth Coalition on the side of Russia.

This situation was exploited by Ali Pasha, whose ambition to occupy the Ionian Islands was well known and had received Napoleon&#x27;s backing, as the Republic was now in the Russian orbit. In spring, Ali&#x27;s forces attacked Lefkada. The reinforcement of the island with Russian and Souliot troops, and the failure of Ali&#x27;s troops to capture the Castle of Santa Maura, led to the attack being broken off. Nevertheless, on 2 June the Senate resolved the establishment of an &#x27;Ionian Encampment&#x27; () on Lefkada, comprising the Republic&#x27;s regular forces as well as all the island militias. At the same time, a fortification programme was begun, and Ioannis Kapodistrias was named Commissioner Extraordinary to oversee it. The defence of Lefkada soon attracted widespread support, and even klepht captains from the mainland rushed to join it, including Katsantonis, Kitsos Botsaris, Dimitrios Karaiskos, Georgios Varnakiotis, and most notably, Theodoros Kolokotronis. It was there that Kapodistrias first came into contact with some of the chief military leaders of the subsequent Greek War of Independence.

Ultimately, the fate of the Septinsular Republic would be decided in the battlefields and chanceries of Europe: in the Treaty of Tilsit in July, the Ionian Islands were ceded once again to Napoleonic France. On 20 August, French troops landed on Corfu, followed three days later by General César Berthier, who received control of the islands from the Russian admiral Dmitry Senyavin. As the Russians departed, French troops replaced them in all islands, as well as the mainland dependency of Parga. Finally, on 1 September, contrary to his instructions to preserve the Islands&#x27; constitution, Berthier as Governor-General declared the annexation of the Septinsular Republic to France.

==Aftermath: Second French rule and British conquest==
Berthier moved swiftly to abolish the Republic&#x27;s attributes as an independent state: the French flag was hoisted, all public officials and soldiers took an oath of allegiance to Napoleon, the embassies and agencies of the Republic abroad were abolished, and all domestic bodies apart from the courts and the Senate as well. These measures annoyed Napoleon, who replaced Berthier as Governor-General with François-Xavier Donzelot. His chief task, according to the instructions sent by Napoleon, was to defend the islands, and above all Corfu, against the mounting British threat. In November 1807, Napoleon regulated the administration of the new French possessions: the internal structure of the Republic was retained largely along the lines of the 1803 Constitution, including the Ionian Senate (although its members were now appointed rather than elected), but the administration was overseen by a Governor-General and an Imperial Commissioner, with Julien Bessières the first to occupy the latter post.

The British had reacted to the French takeover of the islands by a naval blockade, which impeded both trade and the supply of the islands. The resulting hardships, and the activities of British agents, inflamed anti-French sentiments, and some Ionian captains petitioned the British commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, John Stuart, for aid in expelling the French from the islands. Indeed, in October 1809 a British expeditionary force under Brigadier John Oswald arrived at Zakynthos, and issued a proclamation promising to restore the Ionian Islands&#x27; liberty and independence. Due to the small size of the French garrisons, the British quickly occupied Zakynthos and Cephalonia (4 October), Ithaca (8 October), and Kythira (12 October), installing provisional administrations according to the existing laws.

The first major military operation was against Lefkada, in April 1810, where Greek auxiliaries under Theodoros Kolokotronis and the British major Richard Church played a particularly important role. Despite strong French resistance, the garrison surrendered on 16 April. On 29 May 1810, on the Paxoi islands a pro-British uprising broke out. The rebels evicted the small French garrison, raised the British flag, and attacked French sympathizers on the islands. However, British troops failed to arrive, and the French in Corfu quickly suppressed the uprising. The British established a Governor-General in Zakynthos (General Oswald until 1810, General George Airey until 1813, and General Sir James Campbell after). Each island was governed by a Governor with a five-member Executive Council, and a local legislative assembly, the Administrative Body. While the British-controlled islands returned to normality, the French-held islands of Corfu and Paxoi, under Donzelot and Imperial Commissioner Mathieu de Lesseps, suffered from the effects of the British blockade, which became official on 10 November 1810.

Finally, Paxoi were occupied by the British in early 1813, followed by Parga on 22 March 1814, after a popular uprising evicted the French. Corfu held out until the first downfall of Napoleon and the restoration of Louis XVIII: The armistice of obliged the French to evacuate Corfu. In June, Donzelot surrendered the island to Campbell. The Ionian Senate, declaring that the Republic had been suspended but not abolished under the French and British occupation, tried to advocate for the independence of the Islands in the Congress of Vienna, but Campbell refused to accept this view, holding that the Republic had ceased to exist after Tilsit, and regarding the appointed Senate as not representative of the Ionian people. In the end, the Ionian Islands were formed into a British protectorate, the &quot;United States of the Ionian Islands&quot;, which existed until the islands were united with the Kingdom of Greece in 1864.

== Languages ==
Due to the long Venetian rule, the Ionian Islands were linguistically and culturally influenced by Italy. During the Venetian period, Italian was used for official purposes in the islands but it was also widely spoken by the upper classes, who were often educated in Italian universities, whereas the vast majority of the population were monolingual Greek-speakers. The only island in which Italian (Venetian) had a wider spread was Cefalonia, where a greater number of people had adopted Venetian as their first language. Italian culture and language retained a dominant status among the educated urban elites well into the 19th century—Italian remained an official language until 1851—but the lower classes remained &quot;monolingually and monoculturally Greek&quot;.

The official language was at first the Italian language and then in 1803 Greek became, along with Italian, one of the two official languages of the Republic, with the intention of replacing Italian altogether by 1820. The 1800 constitution of the Septinsular Republic was printed in Greek by the patriarchal press in Constantinople, using many loanwords from Italian for technical terms. However, the new constitution approved in 1803 was drafted in Italian. The text of the constitution was prefaced by the report of the committee that drafted it, which stated that: &quot;the noble, rich and harmonious Hellenic dialect, having been exiled by the Venetians, should be recalled to the dominion and become the language of administration and the interpreter of the active citizens&quot;. However, due to the French occupation after 1807, this was not enacted at the time. It was not until 1852 that Greek became the sole official language of the Ionian Islands.

== Religion ==

Most of the people on these islands during this period were Christians, with a small number of Jews on Corfu, Zante and an even smaller number on Cefalonia. The majority of Christians were Eastern Orthodox. However, there was a significant number of Catholics, especially on Corfu, Zante and Cefalonia. The Constitution of 1803 recognized Orthodoxy as the dominant faith; it also stated that the Roman Catholic faith was recognized and protected. The Constitution also provided for the enactment of a law defining the privileges of the Jews residing in the State.

<doc id="1102188" wikidata="Q1132242" url="?curid=1102188" title="Bastardo, Giano dell'Umbria">
<text>Bastardo is an Italian village and &quot;frazione&quot; (hamlet) of the municipality of Giano dell&#x27;Umbria, in the Province of Perugia, Umbria. As of 2011 its population was of 1,549.

==Geography==
Located in central Umbria in the valley of River Puglia, a tributary of the Tiber, at the altitude of 290 m (951 ft) above sea-level, Bastardo is 7 km far (about 4 mi) from Giano, 6 from Gualdo Cattaneo and 20 from Foligno. It is an agricultural products processing center that counts several hotels and restaurants, due to its location in a scenic area of Umbria.

==History==
The town grew around an inn and stabling station in the 17th or 18th century, and was once known as Osteria del Bastardo (i.e. &quot;Bastard&#x27;s Inn&quot;). In the 1920s the toponym was shortened to its current form and, from 1933, a name change was suggested but it was never modified. Bastardo has been noted for its unusual place name.

<doc id="1102205" wikidata="Q4024718" url="?curid=1102205" title="Cascadia subduction zone">
<text>The Cascadia subduction zone is a fault at a convergent plate boundary, about off the Pacific coast, that stretches from northern Vancouver Island in Canada to Northern California in the United States. It is capable of producing 9.0+ magnitude earthquakes and tsunamis that could reach . The Oregon Department of Emergency Management estimates shaking would last 5–7 minutes along the coast, with strength and intensity decreasing further from the epicenter. It is a very long, sloping subduction zone where the Explorer, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda plates move to the east and slide below the much larger mostly continental North American plate. The zone varies in width and lies offshore beginning near Cape Mendocino, Northern California, passing through Oregon and Washington, and terminating at about Vancouver Island in British Columbia.

The Explorer, Juan de Fuca, and Gorda plates are some of the remnants of the vast ancient Farallon plate which is now mostly subducted under the North American plate. The North American plate itself is moving slowly in a generally southwest direction, sliding over the smaller plates as well as the huge oceanic Pacific plate (which is moving in a northwest direction) in other locations such as the San Andreas Fault in central and southern California.

Tectonic processes active in the Cascadia subduction zone region include accretion, subduction, deep earthquakes, and active volcanism of the Cascades. This volcanism has included such notable eruptions as Mount Mazama (Crater Lake) about 7,500 years ago, the Mount Meager massif (Bridge River Vent) about 2,350 years ago, and Mount St. Helens in 1980. Major cities affected by a disturbance in this subduction zone include Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia; Seattle, Washington; and Portland, Oregon.

==History==

===Tradition===
There are no contemporaneous written records of the 1700 Cascadia earthquake. Orally transmitted legends from the Olympic Peninsula area tell of an epic battle between a thunderbird and a whale. In 2005, seismologist Ruth Ludwin set out to collect and analyze anecdotes from various First Nations groups. Reports from the Huu-ay-aht, Makah, Hoh, Quileute, Yurok, and Duwamish peoples referred to earthquakes and saltwater floods. This collection of data allowed the researchers to come up with an estimated date range for the event; the midpoint was in the year 1701.

===Ghost forests===

During low tide one day in March 1986, paleogeologist Brian Atwater dug along Neah Bay with a &quot;nejiri gama&quot;, a small hand hoe. Under a top layer of sand, he uncovered a distinct plant—arrowgrass—that had grown in a layer of marsh soil. This finding was evidence that the ground had suddenly sunk under sea level, causing saltwater to kill the vegetation. The event had happened so quickly that the top layer of sand sealed away the air, thus preserving centuries-old plants.

In 1987, Atwater mounted another expedition paddling up the Copalis River with Dr. David Yamaguchi, who was then studying the eruptions of Mount St. Helens. The pair happened upon a section of &quot;ghost forest&quot;, so-called due to the dead, gray stumps left standing after a sudden inundation of salt water had killed them hundreds of years ago. Originally thought to have died slowly due to a gradual rise in sea level, closer inspection yielded a different story: the land plummeted up to two meters during an earthquake. Having initially tested spruce using tree-ring dating, they found that the stumps were too rotted to count all the outer rings. However, upon having examined those of the western red cedar and comparing them to the living specimens meters away from the banks, they were able to approximate their year of death. There were rings up until the year 1699, indicating that the incident had occurred shortly thereafter. Root samples confirmed their conclusion, narrowing the time frame to the winter of 1699 to 1700.

As with the arrowgrass site, the banks of the Copalis River are lined with a layer of marsh followed by a layer of sand. Jody Bourgeois and her team went on to demonstrate that the sand cover had originated with a tsunami surge rather than a storm surge.

In 1995, an international team led by Alan Nelson of the USGS further corroborated these findings with 85 new samples from the rest of the Pacific Northwest. All along British Columbia, Washington State, and Oregon, the coast had fallen due to a violent earthquake and been covered by sand from the subsequent tsunami.

A further ghost forest was identified by Gordon Jacoby, a dendrochronologist from Columbia University, underwater in Lake Washington. Unlike the other trees, these suffered from a landslide rather than a dip in the fault during a separate event around 900 CE.

===Activity===
In the 1960s, underground fractures were uncovered by oil companies in Puget Sound. These were believed to be inactive through the 1990s.

In the 1980s, geophysicists Tom Heaton and Hiroo Kanamori of Caltech compared the generally quiet Cascadia to more active subduction zones elsewhere in the Ring of Fire. They found similarities to faults in Chile, Alaska, and Japan&#x27;s Nankai Trough, locations known for megathrust earthquakes, a conclusion that was met with skepticism from other geophysicists at the time.

===Orphan tsunami===

A 1996 study published by seismologist Kenji Satake supplemented the research by Atwater et al. with tsunami evidence across the Pacific. Japanese annals, which have recorded natural disasters since approximately 600 CE, had reports of a sixteen-foot tsunami that struck the coast of Honshu Island during the Genroku era. Since no earthquake had been observed to produce it, scholars dubbed it an &quot;orphan tsunami&quot;. Translating the Japanese calendar, Satake found the incident had taken place around midnight of 27–28 January 1700, ten hours after the earthquake occurred. The original magnitude 9.0 earthquake in the Pacific Northwest had thus occurred around 9 pm Pacific Standard Time on 26 January 1700.

==Geophysics==
The Cascadia subduction zone is a long dipping fault that stretches from Northern Vancouver Island to Cape Mendocino in northern California. It separates the Juan de Fuca and North America plates. New Juan de Fuca plate is created offshore along the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

The Juan de Fuca plate moves toward, and eventually is pushed under the continent (North American plate). The zone separates the Juan de Fuca plate, Explorer plate, Gorda plate, and North American plate. Here, the oceanic crust of the Pacific Ocean has been sinking beneath the continent for about 200 million years, and currently does so at a rate of approximately 40 mm/yr.

At depths shallower than or so, the Cascadia zone is locked by friction while stress slowly builds up as the subduction forces act, until the fault&#x27;s frictional strength is exceeded and the rocks slip past each other along the fault in a megathrust earthquake. Below the plate interface exhibits episodic tremor and slip.

The width of the Cascadia subduction zone varies along its length, depending on the angle of the subducted oceanic plate, which heats up as it is pushed deeper beneath the continent. As the edge of the plate sinks and becomes hotter and more molten, the subducting rock eventually loses the ability to store mechanical stress; earthquakes may result. On the Hyndman and Wang diagram (not shown, click on reference link below) the &quot;locked&quot; zone is storing up energy for an earthquake, and the &quot;transition&quot; zone, although somewhat plastic, could probably rupture.

The Cascadia subduction zone runs from triple junctions at its north and south ends. To the north, just below Haida Gwaii, it intersects the Queen Charlotte Fault and the Explorer Ridge. To the south, just off Cape Mendocino in California, it intersects the San Andreas Fault and the Mendocino fracture zone at the Mendocino triple junction.

== Recent seismicity ==
Subduction zones experience various types of earthquakes (or seismicity); including slow earthquakes, megathrust earthquakes, interplate earthquakes, and intraplate earthquakes. Unlike other subduction zones on Earth, Cascadia currently experiences low levels of seismicity and has not generated a megathrust earthquake since January 26, 1700. Despite low levels of seismicity compared to other subduction zones, Cascadia hosts various types of earthquakes that are recorded by seismic and geodetic instruments, such as seismometers and GNSS receivers.

Tremor, a type of slow fault slip, occurs along almost the entire length of Cascadia at regular intervals of 13–16 months. Tremor occurs deeper on the subduction interface than the locked area where megathrust earthquakes occur. The depth of tremor along the subduction interface in Cascadia ranges from 28 km to 45 km, and the motion is so slow that it is not felt at the surface by people or animals, but it can be measured geodetically. The highest density of tremor activity in Cascadia occurs from northern Washington into southern Vancouver Island, and in northern California. Tremor in Cascadia is monitored by the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network&#x27;s semi-automatic tremor detection system.

The majority of interplate earthquakes, or earthquakes that occur near the boundaries of tectonic plates, near the Cascadia subduction zone occur in the forearc of the overriding North American plate in Washington, west of the Cascade Volcanic Arc and east of where tremor occurs. These earthquakes are sometimes referred to as crustal earthquakes, and they are capable of causing significant damage due to their relatively shallow depths. A damaging magnitude 7 interplate earthquake occurred on the Seattle Fault around 900–930 CE that generated 3 meters of uplift and a 4-5 meter tsunami. A substantial number of forearc interplate earthquakes also occur in northern California. Much less interplate seismicity occurs in Oregon compared to Washington and northern California, although Oregon hosts more volcanic activity than its neighboring states.

Intraslab earthquakes, frequently associated with stresses within the subducting plate in convergent margins, occur most frequently in northern Cascadia along the west coast of Vancouver Island and in Puget Sound, and in southern Cascadia within the subducting Gorda plate, near the Mendocino triple junction offshore of northern California. The 1949 Olympia earthquake was a damaging magnitude 6.7 intraslab earthquake that occurred at 52 km depth and caused eight deaths. Another notable intraslab earthquake in the Puget Sound region was the magnitude 6.8 2001 Nisqually earthquake. Intraslab earthquakes in Cascadia occur in areas where the subducting plate has high curvature. Much of the seismicity that occurs off the coast of northern California is due to intraplate deformation within the Gorda plate. Similar to the distribution of interplate earthquakes in Cascadia, intraslab earthquakes are infrequent in Oregon, with its strongest earthquake since statehood being the 5.6 magnitude 1993 Scotts Mills earthquake, an oblique-slip quake.

==Megathrust earthquakes==
===Earthquake effects===
Megathrust earthquakes are the most powerful earthquakes known to occur, and can exceed magnitude 9.0, which releases 1,000 times more energy than magnitude 7.0 and 1 million times more energy than a magnitude 5.0. They occur when enough energy (stress) has accumulated in the &quot;locked&quot; zone of the fault to cause a rupture. The magnitude of a megathrust earthquake is proportional to length of the rupture along the fault. The Cascadia subduction zone, which forms the boundary between the Juan de Fuca and North American plates, is a very long sloping fault that stretches from mid-Vancouver Island to Northern California.

Because of the great length of the fault, the Cascadia subduction zone is capable of producing very large earthquakes if rupture occurs along its entire length. Thermal and deformation studies indicate that the region 60 kilometers (about 40 miles) downdip (east) of the deformation front (where plate deformation begins) is fully locked (the plates do not move past each other). Further downdip, there is a transition from fully locked to aseismic sliding.

In 1999, a group of Continuous Global Positioning System sites registered a brief reversal of motion of approximately 2 centimeters (0.8 inches) over a 50 kilometer by 300 kilometer (about 30 mile by 200 mile) area. The movement was the equivalent of a 6.7 magnitude earthquake. The motion did not trigger an earthquake and was only detectable as silent, non-earthquake seismic signatures.

In 2004, a study conducted by the Geological Society of America analyzed the potential for land subsidence along the Cascadia subduction zone. It postulated that several towns and cities on the west coast of Vancouver Island, such as Tofino and Ucluelet, are at risk for a sudden, earthquake initiated, 1–2 m subsidence.

===San Andreas Fault connection===
Studies of past earthquake traces on both the northern San Andreas Fault and the southern Cascadia subduction zone indicate a correlation in time which may be evidence that quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered most of the major quakes on the northern San Andreas during at least the past 3,000 years or so. The evidence also shows the rupture direction going from north to south in each of these time-correlated events. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake seems to have been a major exception to this correlation, however, as it was not preceded by a major Cascadia quake.

=== Earthquake timing ===

The last known great earthquake in the northwest was the 1700 Cascadia earthquake, years ago. Geological evidence indicates that great earthquakes (&gt; magnitude 8.0) may have occurred sporadically at least seven times in the last 3,500 years, suggesting a return time of about 500 years. Seafloor core evidence indicates that there have been forty-one subduction zone earthquakes on the Cascadia subduction zone in the past 10,000 years, suggesting a general average earthquake recurrence interval of only 243 years. Of these 41, nineteen have produced a &quot;full margin rupture&quot;, wherein the entire fault opens up. By comparison, similar subduction zones in the world usually have such earthquakes every 100 to 200 years; the longer interval here may indicate unusually large stress buildup and subsequent unusually large earthquake slip.

There is also evidence of accompanying tsunamis with every earthquake. One strong line of evidence for these earthquakes is convergent timings for fossil damage from tsunamis in the Pacific Northwest and historical Japanese records of tsunamis.

The next rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone is anticipated to be capable of causing widespread destruction throughout the Pacific Northwest.

=== Forecasts of the next major earthquake ===

Prior to the 1980s, scientists thought that the subduction zone did not generate earthquakes like other subduction zones around the world, but research by Brian Atwater and Kenji Satake tied together evidence of a large tsunami on the Washington coast with documentation of an orphan tsunami in Japan (a tsunami without an associated earthquake). The two pieces of the puzzle were linked, and they then realized that the subduction zone was more hazardous than previously suggested.

In 2009, some geologists predicted a 10% to 14% probability that the Cascadia subduction zone will produce an event of magnitude 9.0 or higher in the next 50 years. In 2010, studies suggested that the risk could be as high as 37% for earthquakes of magnitude 8.0 or higher.

Geologists and civil engineers have broadly determined that the Pacific Northwest region is not well prepared for such a colossal earthquake. The earthquake is expected to be similar to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, because the rupture is expected to be as long as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The resulting tsunami might reach heights of approximately 30 meters (100 ft). FEMA estimates some 13,000 fatalities from such an event, with another 27,000 injured, which would make it the deadliest natural disaster in American, and North American, history. FEMA further predicts that a million people will be displaced, with yet another 2.5 million requiring food and water. An estimated 1/3 of public safety workers will not respond to the disaster due to a collapse in infrastructure and a desire to ensure the safety of themselves and their loved ones. Other analyses predict that even a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in Seattle would result in 7,700 dead and injured, $33 billion in damage, 39,000 buildings severely damaged or destroyed, and 130 simultaneous fires.

==Cascade Volcanic Arc==

The Cascade Volcanic Arc is a continental volcanic arc that extends from northern California to the coastal peninsula of Alaska. The arc consists of a series of Quaternary age stratovolcanoes that grew on top of pre-existing geologic materials that ranged from Miocene volcanics to glacial ice. The Cascade Volcanic arc is located approximately 100 km inland from the coast, and forms a north-to-south chain of peaks that average over 3,000 m (10,000 ft) in elevation. The major peaks from south to north include:
* Lassen Peak and Mount Shasta (California)
* Crater Lake (Mazama), Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood (Oregon)
* Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Glacier Peak, Mount Baker (Washington)
* Mount Garibaldi and Mount Meager massif (British Columbia)

The most active volcanoes in the chain include Mount St. Helens, Mount Baker, Lassen Peak, Mount Shasta, and Mount Hood. Mount St. Helens captured worldwide attention when it erupted catastrophically in 1980. St. Helens continues to rumble, albeit more quietly, emitting occasional steam plumes and experiencing small earthquakes, both signs of continuing magmatic activity.

Most of the volcanoes have a main, central vent from which the most recent eruptions have occurred. The peaks are composed of layers of solidified andesitic to dacitic magma, and the more siliceous (and explosive) rhyolite.

<doc id="1102211" wikidata="Q302061" url="?curid=1102211" title="Carlos Lehder">
<text>Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas (born 7 September 1949) is a Colombian and German former drug lord who was co-founder of the Medellín Cartel. Born to a German father and Colombian mother, he was the first high-level drug trafficker extradited to the United States, after which he was released from prison in the United States after 33 years in 2020. Originally from Armenia, Colombia, Lehder eventually ran a cocaine transport empire on Norman&#x27;s Cay island, off the Florida coast in the central Bahamas.

Lehder was one of the founding members of Muerte a Secuestradores (&quot;MAS&quot;), a paramilitary group whose focus was to retaliate against the kidnappings of cartel members and their families by the guerrillas.
His motivation to join the MAS was to retaliate against the M-19 guerrilla movement, which, in November 1981, attempted to kidnap him for a ransom; Lehder managed to escape from the kidnappers, though he was shot in the leg.
He was one of the most important MAS and Medellin Cartel operators, and is considered to be one of the most important Colombian drug kingpins to have been successfully prosecuted in the United States.

Additionally, Lehder &quot;founded a neo-Nazi political party, the National Latin Movement, whose main function, police said, appeared to be to force Colombia to abrogate its extradition treaty with the United States.&quot;

== Early life ==
Carlos Lehder is of mixed German-Colombian descent. His father, Klaus Wilhelm Lehder, was an engineer who emigrated from Germany to Armenia, Colombia in 1928, where he participated in the construction of several buildings which had elevators, a rather modern and unusual characteristic at that place and time. When he married Helena Rivas, former beauty queen and the daughter of a jeweller from Manizales, Caldas, he changed his name to Guillermo Lehder. Guillermo and Helena had four sons, with Carlos Enrique, born on 7 September 1949, being the third.

In Armenia, Colombia, the family owned a small inn called &quot;Pensión Alemana&quot; (which would later inspire Carlos to have his own luxurious &quot;Posada Alemana&quot; hotel), where German immigrants would regularly meet. They also ran a small business producing vegetable oils and importing luxury goods such as wine and canned foods. In 1943, following intelligence reports from the United States, the Lehders, along with many Germans in Colombia, were suspected of ideological links with the Nazis and were investigated. The &quot;Pensión Alemana&quot; was alleged to have been a place where Nazis gathered intelligence.

Carlos grew up in Armenia, Colombia until his parents divorced when he was 15, after which he emigrated with his mother to New York in the United States.

== Criminal career ==
=== Early activities and prison ===
Lehder dropped out of school to devote himself to reading books by authors such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Hermann Hesse, while maintaining admiration for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

Lehder started out selling stolen cars and smuggling them to Colombia, where the vehicles arrived in Medellín, avoiding all customs, and were then trafficked by Lehder&#x27;s brother. At the age of 24, Lehder took aviation classes, becoming an expert pilot who would know several air routes, which served as the basis for his growing criminal career, which began with small-quantity marijuana trafficking between the United States and Canada. While serving a sentence for car theft in federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, Lehder decided that, upon his release, he would take advantage of the burgeoning market for cocaine in the United States. To that goal, he enlisted his prison bunkmate, former marijuana dealer George Jung, as a future partner. Jung had experience flying marijuana to the U.S. from Mexico in small aircraft, staying below radar level, and landing on dry lake beds. Inspired by the idea, Lehder decided to apply the principle to cocaine transport and formed a partnership with Jung. While in prison, Lehder set out to learn as much information as possible that could be useful to him in the cocaine business. He would sometimes even spend hours questioning fellow inmates about money laundering and smuggling. Jung allegedly said that Lehder kept countless files and constantly took notes. Lehder&#x27;s ultimate scheme was to revolutionize the cocaine trade by transporting the drug to the United States using small aircraft.

=== Early cocaine career ===
Roman Varone and Jung had already experimented with bringing marijuana into the United States from Mexico in small aircraft below radar range and landing in dry riverbeds. Inspired by that idea, Lehder decided to apply the same principle to drug transport. Lehder&#x27;s dream was to have a huge resort for people like himself and in turn bring justice to his native Colombia. After Lehder and Jung were released (both were paroled but Lehder was deported to Colombia), they built up a small revenue stream through simple, traditional drug smuggling. Specifically, they enlisted two young women who were US citizens to take a vacation to Antigua, receive cocaine, and carry it back with them to the U.S. in their suitcases. Repeating this process several times, Lehder and Jung soon had enough money for an airplane.

Using a small stolen plane and a professional pilot, the pair began to fly cocaine into the United States via the Bahamas, in the process increasing their financial resources and building connections and trust with Colombian suppliers, while spreading money around among Bahamian government officials for political and judicial protection. Their unconventional method of drug-smuggling began to gain credibility. The business had serious setbacks due to constant robberies by common criminals in the US. But marijuana trafficking, which had been very lucrative, came to an end due to the intense police operations in Colombia and a reduction in income due to the cultivation of marijuana in the US. This meant that cocaine trafficking, a profitable business with a more easily transportable product, was worth pursuing.

Lehder and his partners in the Cartel would amass enormous fortunes through cocaine trafficking, which is why they were nicknamed &quot;Los Mágicos&quot; (&quot;The Magicians&quot;), because they had become rich overnight, although Lehder was better known as the &quot;Henry Ford of cocaine&quot;.

=== Norman&#x27;s Cay ===

In the late 1970s, the Lehder-Jung partnership began to diverge, due to some combination of Lehder&#x27;s and his secret scheming to secure a personal Bahamian island as an all-purpose headquarters for his operations.
That island was Norman&#x27;s Cay, which at that point consisted of a marina, a yacht club, approximately 100 private homes, and an airstrip. In 1978, Lehder began buying up property and harassing and threatening the island&#x27;s residents; at one point, a yacht was found drifting off the coast with the corpse of one of its owners aboard. Lehder is estimated to have spent $4.5 million on the island in total.
As Lehder paid or forced the local population to leave, and began to assume total control of the island, Norman&#x27;s Cay became his lawless private fiefdom, after allegedly bribing the Prime Minister of the Bahamas Lynden Pindling. By this time, he had forced Jung out of the operation, and international criminal financier Robert Vesco had allegedly become a partner. Jung used his prior connections to take up a more modest line of independent smuggling for Pablo Escobar and stayed out of Lehder&#x27;s way.

From 1978 through 1982, the Cay was the Caribbean&#x27;s main drug-smuggling hub, and a tropical hideaway and playground for Lehder and associates. They flew cocaine in from Colombia on all sorts of aircraft able to land fully loaded on the airstrip, reloaded it into various small aircraft, and then distributed it to locations in Georgia, Florida, and the Carolinas. Lehder was believed to have kept one kilo out of every four that was transported through Norman&#x27;s Cay.

Lehder expanded a runway to , protected by radar, bodyguards, and Doberman attack dogs for the fleet of aircraft under his command. The island also had the Colombian flag flying above it, and the National Anthem of Colombia was often sung. At the height of his operation, 300 kilograms of cocaine would arrive on the island daily, and Lehder&#x27;s wealth mounted into the billions. He accumulated such staggering wealth that on two occasions he offered to pay the Colombian external debt. In 1978, he made an offer to do so to President Alfonso López Michelsen, in exchange for a free space for drug trafficking. In 1982, through Pablo Escobar, who was a Colombian Congressman at the time, Lehder did so again, this time in an attempt to prevent his extradition. In 1981, the DEA and the Bahamas police intervened on the island dismantling the empire built by Lehder, who escaped capture and said goodbye to the island on July 10, 1982, by bombing Clifford Park in Nassau with pamphlets with the phrase &quot;DEA go home&quot; written on them. Some of those pamphlets had $100 bills attached to them.

== Return to Colombia ==
Lehder returned to Colombia where, in addition to resuming his business, he was recognized for giving the government of Quindío a modern plane Piper PA-31 Navajo for the time. Such a gift caught the attention of the authorities and the public because despite being used on several occasions, its high cost overruns forced its sale a year after it was legalized. It is believed that the plane had been secretly repurchased by Lehder taking advantage of its legalization, and said plane would travel anywhere in Colombia unnoticed, while the money given to the government for the sale of the aircraft was used to improve a hospital for the less favored classes, and mysteriously the plane would return to the El Eden airport in Armenia in poor condition.

Also called &quot;Man of the world&quot; and being a fan of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, he became a bohemian and highly popular man in Quindío and in the midst of the coffee boom, showing a wealth comparable to any millionaire of the world, something very different from the wealthy classes of the time. Lehder, in turn, owned expensive cars, with license plates so admired by Armenians that it got to the point of betting his license plate numbers in the regional lottery, not forgetting Lehder&#x27;s charisma, who would employ many people from the region.

=== Participation in the MAS ===
On November 19, 1981, he was kidnapped by the guerrilla movement M-19. Lehder escaped, while being wounded in the leg, and was helped by an unknown person, who not only rejected the million-dollar gratitude offered by Lehder but also did not know the identity of the drug trafficker. The failed kidnapping happened a week after the kidnapping of Martha Nieves Ochoa; which led to the creation of the paramilitary group MAS. Lehder offered a million-dollar reward for his ephemeral captors, several of whom had been kidnapped by Escobar for the kidnapping of the younger sister of his partners, who in turn would increase his security measures since then; hiring ex-agents from DAS, Sijin, army, etc., in addition to buying a luxurious limousine belonging to a former German chancellor with built-in weapons which were never used by Lehder. That limousine was stored in the &quot;Mónaco&quot; building and was one of the few surviving vehicles of the attack perpetrated by the Cali Cartel.

=== The National Latin Movement ===
In 1982, Belisario Betancur is elected president of Colombia. Lehder admired him for his almost homonymous origin since Betancur was a native of Amagá. After his election, Betancur declared a patrimonial amnesty, which Lehder takes advantage of to legalize his money and assets. In addition, Lehder follows Escobar&#x27;s example by dabbling in politics by founding the Movimiento Cívico Latino Nacional (National Latin Civic Movement), a political movement based on the principles of anti-communism, neo-Nazism, Anti-colonialist, Non-Aligned, Anti-fascism, Anti-Zionism, Anti-Marxist-Leninist, as well as declaring itself Latin American, Nationalist, Regionalist, Moralist, Ecologist, Bolivarian, Republican, Catholic, Apostolic, Roman and supporter of legalization in favor of a Pan-American union similar to NATO with its own army and with which it mainly gave speeches against the extradition of Colombians and Latin Americans to American prisons.

Extradition was by then a controversial issue for most sectors of Colombian society, especially for the members of the Medellín Cartel. Lehder began to be recognized by the US authorities thanks to Ed Worth, a former partner of Norman&#x27;s Cay and Sears, and Lehder began to be investigated by the prosecutor Robert Merkle who traveled to Bogotá and presented said evidence before the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia to study his extradition.

The newly created National Latin Movement (founded in the Posada Alemana) obtains the support of Luis Fernando Mejía, a renowned Pereiran poet and political mentor. The movement obtains more than 10,000 followers in the department of Quindío and with broad support in small towns and with a significant impact in large cities of the country, although becoming a serious adversary for the departmental political class, however, the origin of its Fortune would draw the attention of the Colombian authorities who would know of his old businesses in Norman&#x27;s Cay as well as several incidents in Miami due to wars between gangs associated with cocaine trafficking. On the other hand, the recently appointed Minister of Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla publicly denounced the leaking of &quot;Dineros Calientes&quot; (money of dubious origin) in political movements and in national soccer teams, while several sectors would accuse Lehder of handling illicit money for bribes. The Supreme Court of Justice authorizes Lehder&#x27;s extradition, although it would have to be signed by President Betancur.

== Downfall ==

Their government&#x27;s approval of the extradition of Colombians encouraged Escobar and Lehder to participate in politics. Lehder founded the National Latino Movement (&quot;Movimiento Latino Nacional&quot;, in Spanish), which managed three congressional seats, and popularized itself by making speeches against extradition.

The April 30, 1984 assassination of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, the Colombian Minister of Justice, initiated the beginning of the end for Lehder and the Medellín Cartel. Lara had campaigned against the cartel&#x27;s activities, and his murder marked a change in Colombian politics. President Belisario Betancur, who had previously opposed extraditing any Colombian drug lords to the United States, announced that he was now willing to extradite. Lehder was a leading individual on the crackdown list.

Other major Medellín Cartel associates fled to the protection of Manuel Noriega in Panama, but when Pablo Escobar discovered Noriega was plotting to betray him to the U.S. in return for amnesty, the cartel associates then fled to Nicaragua to seek the assistance of Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega. Escobar had paid some of Noriega&#x27;s closest colonels to inform him of Noriega&#x27;s intentions.

Lehder&#x27;s downfall was assisted by his blatant bribing of Bahamian officials, and the attention the activities on Norman&#x27;s Cay were attracting.

=== Fugitive, capture, trial, and whereabouts ===
After Brian Ross&#x27;s September 5, 1983 report, on the U.S. television network NBC, made public the corruption of Bahamian government leaders, Lehder could not return to Norman&#x27;s Cay. The government had frozen all his bank accounts and taken over his property and possessions, and he went from being a billionaire to nearly bankrupt. While on the run in the jungle, he got sick with a fever. Escobar sent a helicopter for Lehder and brought him back to Medellín, where he received medical attention to save his life. Even so, he was left very weak. When Lehder recovered, Escobar hired him as a bodyguard.

Eventually, Lehder wanted to rebuild his fortune, but he was captured at a farm he had just established in Colombia, when a new employee of his informed the police of his location. Another hypothesis supported by Jhon Jairo Velásquez, better known as &quot;Popeye&quot;, the head assassin of Pablo Escobar, is that fellow members of the Medellín Cartel wanted him out of the picture due to his radical military-like behavior, which they believed would jeopardize their cocaine empire, and so Escobar himself provided Lehder&#x27;s whereabouts to the police, leading to Lehder&#x27;s capture.

Having captured one of the Cartel&#x27;s most powerful members, the U.S. government used him as a source of information about the details of the Cartel&#x27;s secret empire, which later proved useful in assisting the Colombian government to dismantle the Cartel. In 1987, Lehder was extradited to Jacksonville, Florida. He was kept in a holding cell in the federal courthouse, watched by armed officers all hours of the day. In 1988, he was convicted and sentenced to life without parole, plus an additional 135 years. Now all of the other leaders knew what would happen if they too were extradited; soon afterward, the Medellín Cartel began to fracture into separate organizations. 

These smaller organizations were left vulnerable to the multi pronged preexisting pressures being applied against the Medellin Cartel. A violent war began as the Medellín Cartel leaders tried to protect themselves by fighting back. Escobar&#x27;s faction, initially both the most powerful and violent, rapidly disintegrated in the face of attacks by the rival Cali Cartel, Colombian police/army, organs of the U.S. government, and vigilante paramilitaries. 

In 1992, in exchange for Lehder&#x27;s agreement to testify against Manuel Noriega, his sentence was reduced to a total of 55 years. Three years after that, Lehder wrote a letter to a federal district judge, complaining that the government had reneged on a deal to transfer him to a German prison. The letter was construed as a threat against the judge.

Within weeks of sending that letter in the fall of 1995, Lehder was whisked away into the night, according to several protected witnesses at the Mesa Unit in Arizona. According to journalist and author Tamara S. Inscoe-Johnson, who worked on the Lehder defense during the time in question, Lehder was simply transferred to another prison and continued to be held in WITSEC, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons&#x27; version of the federal Witness Protection Program. Inscoe-Johnson argued that Lehder had not been released, despite Internet rumors to the contrary. Inscoe-Johnson also believed Lehder would never be released: allegedly, he would be privy to secret information regarding the CIA&#x27;s and his own involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.

On July 22, 2005, he appeared in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit to contest his sentence. Lehder appeared &quot;pro se&quot;, arguing that the United States failed to carry out its obligations under a cooperation agreement he had entered into with the United States Attorney&#x27;s Office, after he held up his end of the deal. (&quot;United States v. Lehder-Rivas&quot;, 136 Fed. Appx. 324; 2005).

In May 2007, Lehder requested the Supreme Court of Colombia and the Colombian government to intervene in order to comply with the extradition agreement established between Colombia and the US, which stated that a maximum sentence of 30 years would be applied to any extradited Colombian citizen. Lehder argued that, having already served 20 years in prison, which corresponded to two-thirds of the 30-year maximum time stated in the treaty, he had completed his legal sentence and should therefore be released.

In May 2008, Lehder&#x27;s lawyer declared to &quot;El Tiempo&quot; that a &quot;habeas corpus&quot; petition had been filed, alleging that Lehder&#x27;s cooperation agreement had been violated and that &quot;a court in Washington&quot; had less than 30 days to respond to the notice.

According to his lawyer, Lehder was transferred to a minimum security prison in Florida. He was visited regularly by family members and had access to TV and a computer with only email access. An article published by &quot;Cronica Del Quindio&quot; in January 2015 reported that Lehder could be released and extradited to Germany at any time.

On June 24, 2015, Lehder wrote a letter to then-President of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos, in which he requested mediation with the United States to be allowed to return to Colombia.

Lehder was released from prison on June 15, 2020, and escorted to Germany by two US officials on a regular passenger flight from New York to Frankfurt and handed over to German authorities. According to declarations made by his daughter, a reason for his release is a relapse of prostate cancer, which had been diagnosed years earlier. A charity in Germany has agreed to pay for treatment.

<text>American Renaissance (AR or AmRen) is a white supremacist website and former monthly magazine publication founded and edited by Jared Taylor. It is published by the New Century Foundation. 

Since the magazine&#x27;s first issue in 1990, it has become linked to various white supremacist people and organizations. It hosted conferences attended by neo-Nazis and white nationalists. Starting in 2017, the magazine and Taylor&#x27;s accounts were suspended by multiple social media platforms. The Southern Poverty Law Center listed American Renaissance as a &quot;white nationalist hate group&quot;.

==History==

The magazine and the New Century Foundation were established by Jared Taylor; the first issue of &quot;American Renaissance&quot; was published in November 1990.

Both the magazine and foundation, as well as Taylor have had links with organizations such as the Council of Conservative Citizens, the Pioneer Fund, and the British National Party. Former Grand Wizards of the Ku Klux Klan Don Black and David Duke have attended &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conferences and have been seen talking with Taylor. Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes has also written for &quot;American Renaissance&quot;. The organization has held bi-annual conferences that attract neo-Nazis, white nationalists, white separatists, Holocaust deniers, and eugenicists. Attendance at the conferences has varied; in February 2008, some 300 people attended.

==Content==
&quot;American Renaissance&quot; is a white supremacist publication. It has been described as &quot;alt-right&quot; by &quot;The Guardian&quot;. On December 18, 2017, the accounts for the magazine and its editor Jared Taylor were suspended by Twitter. Before the suspension, the magazine&#x27;s account had 32,800 followers.

The publication promotes pseudoscientific notions &quot;that attempt to demonstrate the intellectual and cultural superiority of whites and publishes articles on the supposed decline of American society because of integrationist social policies.&quot;

According to Carol M. Swain, &quot;&quot;American Renaissance&quot; has become the leading intellectual journal of contemporary white nationalism with a small but highly educated readership which sees itself as the vanguard of a new race realism that seeks to rescue America from the harmful effects of multiculturalist dogmas.&quot; YouTube banned the &quot;American Renaissance&quot; channel, along with those of individual white nationalists, in late June 2020 for violating the website&#x27;s policies against hate speech.

==Reception and controversy==
===Southern Poverty Law Center===
American Renaissance and the New Century Foundation appear on a list of 115 &quot;white nationalist hate groups&quot; published in the &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; of the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).

Mark Potok, editor-in-chief of the &quot;Intelligence Report&quot;, has said: &quot;Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen.&quot; Taylor stated in a radio interview: &quot;I&#x27;ve never been a member of the Klan. I&#x27;ve never known a person who is a member of the Klan.&quot; An article in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported that Taylor had at least met former Klansman David Duke at an American Renaissance conference, and sat with Don Black, a former Grand Wizard of the Klan, at Taylor&#x27;s kitchen table.

An article in the &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; by Potok and Heidi Beirich, head of the SPLC&#x27;s &quot;Intelligence Project&quot; stated: &quot;&quot;American Renaissance&quot; has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy. Today, it may be the closest thing the extreme right has to a real think tank. Whether or not it survives, and in what form, genuinely matters.&quot;

===Anti-Defamation League===
The American non-governmental organization Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes &quot;American Renaissance&quot; as a &quot;white supremacist journal&quot;. The ADL also writes: &quot;Taylor eschews anti-Semitism. Seeing Jews as white, greatly influential and the &#x27;conscience of society&#x27;, Taylor rather seeks to partner with Jews who share his views on race and racial diversity&quot; and &quot;Jews have been speakers or participants at all eight American Renaissance conferences&quot; although controversy followed accusations by David Duke, who was not a scheduled presenter, at the 2006 conference.

===Conferences===
&quot;American Renaissance&quot; has held conferences since 1994. Anti-racist activists were sometimes successful in persuading private hotels to cancel their reservations with &quot;American Renaissance&quot;. In 2011, the publication planned to hold a three-day conference at a Sheraton Airport hotel in Charlotte, North Carolina. The hotel canceled the group&#x27;s booking amid plans by anti-racism activists and the Jewish Defense Organization (JDO) to protest at the conference site. The mayor &quot;pro tem&quot; of the city also reportedly contacted the hotel.

Since 2012, the &quot;American Renaissance&quot; has held its conference at Montgomery Bell State Park Inn in Burns, Tennessee, a state-owned site. Protests have often taken place outside the conference facilities.

In 2017, Helmuth Nyborg spoke at an &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conference.

===Alleged DHS memo regarding 2011 Tucson shooting===
A document—initially claimed to be a leaked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) memo—alleged that Jared Lee Loughner, the accused gunman in the 2011 Tucson shooting that wounded Congresswoman Gabby Giffords and killed six bystanders, may have had ties to American Renaissance, which it called an &quot;anti-ZOG (Zionist Government) and anti-semitic&quot; group. In an interview with Fox News, Jared Taylor denied the organization ever used the term &quot;ZOG&quot; and said Loughner had no connection to them.

DHS officials the following day reported: &quot;the department has not established any such possibility, undercutting what appears to be the primary basis for this claim&quot;. Furthermore, no such memo had been issued.

Major David Denlinger, commander of the Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center acknowledged that the document came from his agency, but contained errors. He said that he has no reason to believe that Loughner had any direct connection with or was being directed by &quot;American Renaissance&quot;.

<text>George Newbern (born December 30, 1964) is an American actor, best known for his roles as Charlie in the ABC show &quot;Scandal&quot; (2012–2018) and Bryan MacKenzie in &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991) and its sequels &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot; (1995) and &quot;Father of the Bride Part 3 (ish)&quot; (2020). He guest starred as Danny (The Yeti) in &quot;Friends&quot; and had a recurring role as Julia&#x27;s son Payne in &quot;Designing Women&quot;. 

He is also known for his long-running role as the voice of Superman in various DC media starting with the animated series &quot;Justice League,&quot; as well as the voice of Sephiroth in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series.

==Early life==
Having grown up in North Little Rock, Arkansas, Newbern is the son of Betty, a Spanish teacher and David Newbern, a radiologist. George has two brothers (Gordon and John) and one sister (Murry).

==Career==
===Film and television===
He began his acting career at the Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock, in the role of the younger brother in &quot;Life with Father&quot;, based on Clarence S. Day Jr.&#x27;s autobiographical novels. This first acting role spurred him on to other acting roles and eventually on to film roles. Newbern&#x27;s first lead role was in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Double Switch,&quot; a retelling of &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot; that aired as a part of the &quot;Wonderful World of Disney&quot; television series.

From 1986 to 1992, Newbern had a recurring role as Payne McIlroy, the son of designer Julia Sugarbaker (played by Dixie Carter), on the series &quot;Designing Women&quot;. He has since guest-starred on television in such series as &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, &quot;Bull&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, &quot;Ghost Whisperer&quot;, &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, and &quot;Private Practice&quot;. He had a recurring role for several seasons as a former CIA operative in &quot;Scandal&quot;.

He starred as Neal Morris, father of Melissa Morris (Emily Osment), in the 2009 Disney Channel film &quot;Dadnapped,&quot; and portrayed Apollo 14 astronaut Stu Roosa in the HBO mini-series &quot;From The Earth To The Moon&quot;. Film credits include &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot; (1987) with Elisabeth Shue; &quot;Double Switch&quot; (1987); &quot;Switching Channels&quot; (1988) with Kathleen Turner, Burt Reynolds and Christopher Reeve; and &quot;Father of the Bride&quot; (1991) and its sequel &quot;Father of the Bride Part II&quot;. In 2009 he appeared in &quot;Locker 13&quot;.

===Voice acting===
As a voice actor, Newbern is notable for his role as Clark Kent/Superman on the Cartoon Network series &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot; and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; (replacing Tim Daly due to his obligations elsewhere). He also reprised his role as Superman in &quot;The Batman&quot;, the &quot;DC Showcase&quot; short &quot;Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam&quot;, and &quot;Superman vs. The Elite&quot;. On February 26, 2016, the &quot;DC Universe Online&quot; Facebook page reported that Newbern would be taking over the role of Superman from Adam Baldwin. He also provides the voice of Superman in the game &quot;&quot; and its sequel. Newbern has portrayed the character longer than any other actor in live-action and animation.

Newbern also lent his voice in the cartoon series &quot;The Pirates of Dark Water&quot;, and he has also done voiceovers on a number of video games and game-related productions. He has also voiced in the infamous &quot;Theodore Rex&quot; as the character of the same name. In 2003, Newbern provided the voice of Mevyn Nooj in &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. He also voiced Sephiroth in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series.

His performance as Nooj reportedly impressed the developers at Square Enix enough for them to cast him as Sephiroth in the English version of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (replacing Lance Bass) and he would also go on to reprise the role in the English-language releases of &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;, &quot;Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy NT&quot;. He later appeared in the second season of &quot;Jericho&quot; as the President of the Allied States of America. Newbern also narrated Toyota&#x27;s commercials for the 2010 model year of the Prius, one of the car company&#x27;s younger automotive models, and portrayed Harold in &quot;Saw VI&quot;.

Newbern is also a prolific narrator of audiobooks, with narration credits on nearly 500 titles.

==Personal life==
Newbern met actress Marietta DePrima in the mid-1980s. They graduated together at Northwestern University, where she was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. The couple married in 1990, and have three children.

<doc id="1102237" wikidata="Q1596292" url="?curid=1102237" title="Joint Tactical Radio System">
<text>The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) aimed to replace existing radios in the American military with a single set of software-defined radios that could have new frequencies and modes (“waveforms”) added via upload, instead of requiring multiple radio types in ground vehicles, and using circuit board swaps in order to upgrade. JTRS has seen cost overruns and full program restructurings, along with cancellation of some parts of the program. 

JTRS HMS (Handheld, Manpack &amp; Small Form-Fit (SFF)) radios are jointly developed and manufactured by Thales and General Dynamics Mission Systems. These software-defined radios are designed as successors to the JTRS-compatible CSCHR (Consolidated Single Channel Handheld Radios, ie. AN/PRC-148 and AN/PRC-152), securely transmitting voice and data simultaneously using Type 2 cryptography and the new Soldier Radio Waveform.

The Army announced in June 2015 a Request for Proposal (RFP) for full-rate production of the HMS program. Goal was set for assessment in 2015-2016 and for full rate production in 2017.

JTRS is widely seen as one of the DoD&#x27;s greatest acquisition failures, having spent $6B over 15 years without delivering a radio.

==Overview==
Launched with a Mission Needs Statement on August 21, 1997 and a subsequent Operational Requirements Document (ORD) on March 23, 1998 (which was revised several times), the original name was simply Joint Tactical Radio (JTR). This effort was led by the Joint Staff and was represented by all four Services. Each team member reported to their Service&#x27;s chief information officer and reported back to the Joint Staff J6. The ORD started with 38 Threshold waveforms/radios and 4 Objective waveforms to support operations in three domain: Airborne, Maritime, and Ground Forces. Originally the JTR ORD do not address a software defined construct. The working group looked at the Navy&#x27;s SPEAKeasy program as well as the USSOCOM sponsored Thales MultiBand Inter/Intra Team Radios. The JTR became Joint Tactical Radio System when the Navy took over as the acquisition executive agent. JTRS became a family of software-defined radios that were to work with many existing military and civilian radios. It included integrated encryption and Wideband Networking Software to create mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).

The JTRS program was beset by delays and cost overruns, particularly Ground Mobile Radios (GMR), run by Boeing. Problems included a decentralized management structure, changing requirements, and unexpected technical difficulties that increased size and weight goals that made it harder to add the required waveforms.

The JTRS was built on the Software Communications Architecture (SCA), an open-architecture framework that tells designers how hardware and software are to operate in harmony. It governs the structure and operation of the JTRS, enabling programmable radios to load waveforms, run applications, and be networked into an integrated system. A Core Framework, providing a standard operating environment, must be implemented on every hardware set. Interoperability among radio sets was increased because the same waveform software can be easily ported to all radios.

The Object Management Group (OMG), a not-for-profit consortium that produces and maintains computer industry specifications for interoperable enterprise applications, is working toward building an international commercial standard based on the SCA.

==JTRS Program of Record==

The Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) as a Program of Record evolved from a loosely associated group of radio replacement programs to an integrated effort to network multiple weapon system platforms and forward combat units where it matters most – at the last tactical mile. In 2005, JTRS was restructured under the leadership of a Joint Program Executive Officer (JPEO) headquartered in San Diego, California. The JPEO JTRS provides an enterprise acquisition and management approach to successfully and efficiently develop, produce, integrate, test and field the JTRS networking capability.

The JTRS Enterprise was composed of five ACAT 1D programs of record - Network Enterprise Domain (NED), Ground Mobile Radios (GMR), Handheld, Manpack, &amp; Small Form Fit (HMS), Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTRS, and Airborne, Maritime Fixed/Station (AMF) and one ACAT III program - Handheld JTRS Enhanced Multi-Band Intra-Team Radio (JEM).

===JTRS Network Enterprise Domain (NED)===
JTRS NED was responsible for the development, sustainment, and enhancement of interoperable networking and legacy software waveforms. NED&#x27;s product line consists of:

* 14 Legacy Waveforms
** Bowman VHF
** Collection Of Broadcasts From Remote Assets (COBRA)
** Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS)
** HAVE QUICK II
** High Frequency Single sideband / Automatic link establishment (HF SSB/ALE)
** NATO Standardization Agreement 5066 (HF 5066)
** Link 16
** Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System (SINCGARS)
** Ultra High Frequency Demand Assigned Multiple Access Satellite communications (UHF DAMA SATCOM) 181/182/183/184
** Ultra High Frequency Line-of-Sight Communications System (UHF LOS)
** Very High Frequency Line-of-Sight Communications System (VHF LOS)
* three Mobile Ad Hoc Networking Waveforms
** Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW)
** Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW)
** Mobile User Objective System ([MUOS–Red Side Processing)
* Network Enterprise Services (NES) including
** JTRS WNW Network Manager (JWNM)
** Soldier Radio Waveform Network Manager (SRWNM)
** JTRS Enterprise Network Manager (JENM)
** Enterprise Network Services (ENS)

===JTRS Ground Mobile Radios (GMR)===
JTRS GMR are a key enabler of the DoD and Army Transformation and will provide critical communications capabilities across the full spectrum of Joint operations. Through software reconfiguration, JTRS GMR can emulate current force radios and operate new Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking waveforms offering increased data throughput utilizing self-forming, self-healing, and managed communication networks. The GMR route and retransmit functionality links various waveforms in different frequency bands to form one internetwork. GMR can scale from one to four channels supporting multiple security levels and effectively use the frequency spectrum within the 2 megahertz to 2 gigahertz frequency range. The radios are Software Communications Architecture compliant with increased bandwidth through future waveforms and are interoperable with 4+ current force radio systems and the JTRS family of radios.

Now that the GMR contract has been completed, the Army plans to leverage knowledge gained from the GMR Program in the upcoming Mid-Tier Networking Vehicular Radio solicitation.

===JTRS Handheld, Manpack &amp; Small Form Fit (HMS)===
JTRS HMS is a materiel solution meeting the requirements of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration/DoD Chief Information Officer for a Software Communications Architecture (SCA) compliant hardware system hosting SCA-compliant software waveforms (applications).

The JTRS HMS contract was structured to address Increment 1, consisting of Phases 1 and 2. Increment 1, Phase 1 was to develop the AN/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio sets and embedded SFF-A (one channel), SFF-A (two channel) and SFF-D (one channel) versions. The AN/PRC-154 Rifleman Radio sets and SFFs were to utilize the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) in a sensitive but unclassified environment (Type 2). In order to mitigate program waveform porting and integration challenges, the SRW application, which is managed by the JTRS Network Enterprise Domain, was developed on a Waveform Development Environment with HMS as the lead platform for porting.

Increment 1, Phase 2 was to develop the two channel manpack, two channel handheld, and embedded SFF-B, versions that are all Type 1 compliant for use in a classified environment. Waveforms on the phased sets include Ultra High Frequency (UHF) Satellite Communications, Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW), High Frequency (HF), Enhanced Position Location and Reporting System (EPLRS), Mobile-User Objective System (MUOS), and Single Channel Ground to Air Radio System (SINCGARS).

===Multifunctional Information Distribution System (MIDS) JTRS===
MIDS is a secure, scalable, modular, wireless, and jam-resistant digital information system currently providing Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN), Link-16, and J-Voice to airborne, ground, and maritime joint and coalition warfighting platforms. MIDS provides real-time and low-cost information and situational awareness via digital and voice, communications within the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) Enterprise. The MIDS Program includes MIDS-LVT and the MIDS JTRS Terminal. MIDS-LVT is in full rate production and MIDS JTRS is in evolutionary development and limited production. MIDS JTRS is a “form fit function” replacement for MIDS–LVT and adds three additional channels for JTRS waveforms as required by joint and coalition warfighter.

===JTRS Airborne &amp; Maritime/Fixed Station (AMF)===
AMF will provide a four-channel, full duplex, software-defined radio integrated into airborne, shipboard, and fixed-station platforms, enabling maritime and airborne forces to communicate seamlessly and with greater efficiency through implementation of five initial waveforms (i.e., Ultra-High Frequency Satellite Communications, Mobile User Objective System, Wideband Network Waveform, Soldier Radio Waveform, and Link 16) providing data, voice, and networking capabilities. JTRS AMF is software-reprogrammable, multi-band/multi-mode capable, mobile ad hoc network capable, and provides simultaneous voice, data, and video communications. The system is flexible enough to provide point-to-point and netted voice and data, whether it is between Service Command Centers, Shipboard Command Centers, Joint Operations Centers or other functional centers (e.g., intelligence, logistics, etc.). AMF will assist U.S. Armed Forces in the conduct of prompt, sustained, and synchronized operations, allowing warfighters the freedom to achieve information dominance in all domains; land, sea, air, space, and information.

==Waveforms==
JTRS was originally planned to use frequencies from 2 megahertz to 2 gigahertz. The addition of the Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) waveform means the radios will also use frequencies above 2 GHz. Waveforms that were to be supported included:

* Soldier Radio Waveform (SRW) 
* Single Channel Ground Air Radio System (SINCGARS) with Enhanced SINCGARS Improvement Program (ESIP), 30-88 MHz, FM, frequency hopping and single frequency
* HAVE QUICK II military aircraft radio, 225-400 MHz, AM, frequency hopping
* UHF SATCOM, 225-400 MHz, MIL-STD-188-181, -182, -183 and -184 protocols
* Mobile User Objective System (MUOS): It is important to note that the JTRS HMS manpack is the only radio program of record that will deliver terminals supporting the next generation UHF TACSAT MUOS program. 85% of all MUOS terminals are expected to be ground radios, so if JTRS HMS fails, MUOS (funded in the billions) fails as well - unless a COTS solution is developed. This is only true from the Army viewpoint, other services also use MUOS, not related to JTRS. 
* Enhanced Position Location Reporting System (EPLRS), 420-450 MHz spread spectrum
* Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) (under development)
* Link-4A, -11B, - 16, -22/TADIL tactical data links, 960-1215 MHz+

* Digital Wideband Transmission System (DWTS) Shipboard system for high capacity secure &amp; nonsecure, line-of-sight (LOS), ship-to-ship, and ship-to-shore, 1350-1850 MHz
* Soldier Radio &amp; Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), 1.755-1.850, 2.450-2.483.5 GHz, Army Land Warrior program 802.11
* Cellular telephone &amp; PCS, includes multiple US and overseas standards and NSA/NIST Type 1 through 4 COMSEC (SCIP)
* Mobile Satellite Service (MSS), includes both VHF and UHF MSS bands and both fielded and emerging low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit systems and standards, such as Iridium, Globalstar, et al. Includes capability for NSA/NIST Type 1 through 4 COMSEC, 1.61-2 [2.5] GHz. May allow use of geosynchronous satellites with special antenna.
* Integrated Broadcast Service Module (IBS-M). Currently three legacies UHF military broadcasts (TIBS, TDDS, and TRIXS) which will be replaced in the future with a Common Interactive Broadcast (CIB).
* BOWMAN, the UK Tri-Service HF, VHF and UHF tactical communications system.

Several of the above waveforms will not be supported in JTRS Increment 1 and have been deferred to &quot;later increments&quot;. Currently, only Increment 1 is funded. The requirements document for JTRS Increment 2 is under development. JTRS Increment 1 threshold waveforms include:

&quot;Waveform/Applicable radios (based on JTRS ORD Amendment 3.2.1 dtd 28 Aug 06)&quot;
* SRW: Small Form Fit (SFF), Manpack, AMF-Small Airborne, Ground Mobile Radio
* WNW: Ground Mobile Radio, AMF-Small Airborne
* MUOS: AMF-Small Airborne, AMF-Maritime, Manpack (funding was recently added for the manpack)
* Link-16: AMF-Small Airborne, MIDS-J
* UHF SATCOM DAMA: Manpack, Ground Mobile Radio, AMF-Maritime
* SINCGARS ESIP with INC: Ground Mobile Radio

* JAN-TE: MIDS-J

==Problems and restructuring==
In March 2005, the JTRS program was restructured to add a Joint Program Executive Office, a unified management structure to coordinate development of the four radio versions.

In March 2006, the JPEO recommended changing the management structure, reducing the scope of the project, extending the deadline, and adding money. The JPEO&#x27;s recommendations were accepted.

The program is focusing on the toughest part: transformational networking. The JTRS radio was to be a telephone, computer and router in one box that can transmit from 2 MHz to 2 GHz.

A September 2006 Government Accountability Office report said these changes had helped reduce the risk of more cost and schedule overruns to &quot;moderate.&quot;

The U.S. military no longer plans to quickly replace all of its 750,000 tactical radios. The program is budgeted at $6.8 billion to produce 180,000 radios, an average cost per radio of $37,700. Program delays forced DOD to spend an estimated $11 billion to buy more existing tactical radios, such as the U.S. Marine Corps&#x27; Integrated, Intra-Squad Radio, the AN/PRC-117F and the AN/PRC-150.

On June 22, 2007, the Joint Program Executive Office issued the first JTRS-Approved radio (not JTRS-Certified) production contract. It gave Harris Corporation $2.7 billion and Thales Communications Inc. $3.5 billion for first-year procurement and allowed the firms to compete for more parts of the five-year program. Harris could make up to $7 billion; Thales, $9 billion.

In July 2008, the head of OSD AT&amp;L conducted a 10-hour program review after costs continued to grow. Additionally, the JTRS Ground Mobile Radio program, originally funded at around $370 million, has now exceeded $1 billion despite reduced requirements.

In 2012, after the first 100 General Dynamics Manpack radios showed &quot;poor reliability&quot;, the US Army placed a $250 million order for nearly four thousand more of them.

==History==

*CONDOR (Command and Control on the Move Network, Digital Over the Horizon Relay)
During the Iraq War, the USMC developed their own system using commercial off the shelf technology, combining satcoms with wifi, that has worked ever since.

*Ground Mobile Radios
**GMR - formerly Cluster 1, run by the Army, was to equip Marine and Army ground vehicles, Air Force Tactical Air Control Parties (TACPs), and Army helicopters. Cluster 1 also included the development of a Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW), a next-generation IP-based waveform designed to allow mobile ad hoc networking (MANET). In 2005, the cluster was renamed Ground Mobile Radios (GMR) with the Air Force TACP and Army helicopter radios deleted.
*Handeheld Manpack &amp; Small Form Fit
**HMS - formally Cluster 5, led by the Army, developed handheld, man-portable, and smaller radios. In 2006, it was renamed HMS, for Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Factor.
*Airborne &amp; Maritime/Fixed Station
**AMF - formerly Clusters 3 and 4: Cluster 3 aimed to develop a maritime / fixed radio. It was led by the Navy and grew out of the Navy&#x27;s previous Digital Modular Radio program. Cluster 4, led by the Air Force, aimed to provide radios to Air Force and Navy fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. In 2004, Clusters 3 and 4 were combined into the Airborne and Maritime / Fixed-Station program. In 2006, the Army helicopter radio was added to this cluster. In early 2008, JTRS AMF attained Milestone B after it received an additional $700 million. Cost estimates conducted by OSD&#x27;s CAIG determined that the original amount, just over $500 million, was too little. On March 28, 2008, Lockheed Martin announced that the JTRS Joint Program Executive Office picked it to design and provide tactical communications and networking gear for the Air Force, Army, Navy and other users. The initial System Development and Demonstration (SDD) contract value is $766 million. Subcontractors will include BAE Systems, General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Work will be conducted at Scottsdale, Ariz.; San Diego, Calif.; Tampa, Fla.; Fort Wayne, Ind.; Gaithersburg, Md.; St. Paul, Minn.; Wayne, N.J.; Charleston, S.C.; and Chantilly and Reston, Va.
* MIDS JTRS - In 2006, the JTRS program took over the effort to improve the Multifunctional Information Distribution System Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) design, which was developed by a 5-nation consortium in the 1990s. This program was renamed MIDS-JTRS and also experienced cost growth and delays.
*Special Radios
**JEM. - formally Cluster 2, was renamed the JTRS JEM program, adds JTRS capability to the existing handheld AN/PRC-148 Multiband Inter/Intra Team Radio (MBITR) to create the JTRS Enhanced MBITR (JEM). Led by U.S. Special Operations Command, the development effort has certified and fielded the radio.

<text>A Marx generator is an electrical circuit first described by Erwin Otto Marx in 1924. Its purpose is to generate a high-voltage pulse from a low-voltage DC supply. Marx generators are used in high-energy physics experiments, as well as to simulate the effects of lightning on power-line gear and aviation equipment. A bank of 36 Marx generators is used by Sandia National Laboratories to generate X-rays in their Z Machine.

==Principle of operation==
The circuit generates a high-voltage pulse by charging a number of capacitors in parallel, then suddenly connecting them in series. See the circuit diagram on the right. At first, &quot;n&quot; capacitors (&quot;C&quot;) are charged in parallel to a voltage &quot;VC&quot; by a DC power supply through the resistors (&quot;R&quot;C). The spark gaps used as switches have the voltage &quot;VC&quot; across them, but the gaps have a breakdown voltage greater than &quot;VC&quot;, so they all behave as open circuits while the capacitors charge. The last gap isolates the output of the generator from the load; without that gap, the load would prevent the capacitors from charging. To create the output pulse, the first spark gap is caused to break down (triggered); the breakdown effectively shorts the gap, placing the first two capacitors in series, applying a voltage of about 2&quot;VC&quot; across the second spark gap. Consequently, the second gap breaks down to add the third capacitor to the &quot;stack&quot;, and the process continues to sequentially break down all of the gaps. This process of the spark gaps connecting the capacitors in series to create the high voltage is called &quot;erection&quot;. The last gap connects the output of the series &quot;stack&quot; of capacitors to the load. Ideally, the output voltage will be &quot;nVC&quot;, the number of capacitors times the charging voltage, but in practice the value is less. Note that none of the charging resistors &quot;R&quot;c are subjected to more than the charging voltage even when the capacitors have been erected. The charge available is limited to the charge on the capacitors, so the output is a brief pulse as the capacitors discharge through the load. At some point, the spark gaps stop conducting, and the low-voltage supply begins charging the capacitors again.

The principle of multiplying voltage by charging capacitors in parallel and discharging them in series is also used in the voltage multiplier circuit, used to produce high voltages for laser printers and cathode-ray tube television sets, which has similarities to this circuit. One difference is that the voltage multiplier is powered with alternating current and produces a steady DC output voltage, whereas the Marx generator produces a pulse.

==Optimization==
Proper performance depends upon capacitor selection and the timing of the discharge. Switching times can be improved by doping of the electrodes with radioactive isotopes caesium 137 or nickel 63, and by orienting the spark gaps so that ultraviolet light from a firing spark gap switch illuminates the remaining open spark gaps. Insulation of the high voltages produced is often accomplished by immersing the Marx generator in transformer oil or a high pressure dielectric gas such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6).

Note that the less resistance there is between the capacitor and the charging power supply, the faster it will charge. Thus, in this design, those closer to the power supply will charge quicker than those farther away. If the generator is allowed to charge long enough, all capacitors will attain the same voltage.

In the ideal case, the closing of the switch closest to the charging power supply applies a voltage 2&quot;V&quot; to the second switch. This switch will then close, applying a voltage 3&quot;V&quot; to the third switch. This switch will then close, resulting in a cascade down the generator that produces &quot;nV&quot; at the generator output (again, only in the ideal case).

The first switch may be allowed to spontaneously break down (sometimes called a &quot;self break&quot;) during charging if the absolute timing of the output pulse is unimportant. However, it is usually intentionally triggered once all the capacitors in the Marx bank have reached full charge, either by reducing the gap distance, by pulsing an additional trigger electrode (such as a Trigatron), by ionising the air in the gap using a pulsed laser, or by reducing the air pressure within the gap.

The charging resistors, Rc, need to be properly sized for both charging and discharging. They are sometimes replaced with inductors for improved efficiency and faster charging. In many generators the resistors are made from plastic or glass tubing filled with dilute copper sulfate solution. These liquid resistors overcome many of the problems experienced by more-conventional solid resistive materials, which have a tendency to lower their resistance over time under high voltage conditions.

== Short pulses ==
The Marx generator is also used to generate short high-power pulses for Pockels cells, driving a TEA laser, ignition of the conventional explosive of a nuclear weapon, and radar pulses.

Shortness is relative, as the switching time of even high-speed versions is not less than 1 ns, and thus many low-power electronic devices are faster. In the design of high-speed circuits, electrodynamics is important, and the Marx generator supports this insofar as it uses short thick leads between its components, but the design is nevertheless essentially an electrostatic one. When the first gap breaks down, pure electrostatic theory predicts that the voltage across all stages rises. However, stages are coupled capacitively to ground and serially to each other, and thus each stage encounters a voltage rise that is increasingly weaker the further the stage is from the switching one; the adjacent stage to the switching one therefore encounters the largest voltage rise, and thus switches in turn. As more stages switch, the voltage rise to the remainder increases, which speeds up their operation. Thus a voltage rise fed into the first stage becomes amplified and steepened at the same time.

In electrodynamic terms, when the first stage breaks down it creates a spherical electromagnetic wave whose electric field vector is opposed to the static high voltage. This moving electromagnetic field has the wrong orientation to trigger the next stage, and may even reach the load; such noise in front of the edge is undesirable in many switching applications. If the generator is inside a tube of (say) 1 m diameter, it requires around 10 wave reflections for the field to settle to static conditions, which restricts pulse leading edge width to 30 ns or more. Smaller devices are of course faster.

The speed of a switch is determined by the speed of the charge carriers, which gets higher with higher voltage, and by the current available to charge the inevitable parasitic capacitance. In solid-state avalanche devices, a high voltage automatically leads to high current. Because the high voltage is applied only for a short time, solid-state switches will not heat up excessively. As compensation for the higher voltages encountered, the later stages have to carry lower charge too. Stage cooling and capacitor recharging also go well together.

==Stage variants==
Avalanche diodes can replace a spark gap for stage voltages less than 500 volts. The charge carriers easily leave the electrodes, so no extra ionisation is needed and jitter is low. The diodes also have a longer lifetime than spark gaps.

A speedy switching device is an NPN avalanche transistor fitted with a coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere drop, each switch avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.

== Applications ==
One application is so-called boxcar switching of a Pockels cell. Four Marx generators are used, each of the two electrodes of the Pockels cell being connected to a positive pulse generator and a negative pulse generator. Two generators of opposite polarity, one on each electrode, are first fired to charge the Pockels cell into one polarity. This will also partly charge the other two generators but not trigger them, because they have been only partly charged beforehand. Leakage through the Marx resistors needs to be compensated by a small bias current through the generator. At the trailing edge of the boxcar, the two other generators are fired to &quot;reverse&quot; the cell.

Marx generators are used to provide high-voltage pulses for the testing of insulation of electrical apparatus such as large power transformers, or insulators used for supporting power transmission lines. Voltages applied may exceed two million volts for high-voltage apparatus.

In food industry Marx generators are used for Pulsed Electric Fields processing to induce cutting improvement or drying acceleration for potato and other fruits and vegetables.

<doc id="1102279" wikidata="Q342770" url="?curid=1102279" title="Robert Earnshaw">
<text>Robert Earnshaw (born 6 April 1981) is a Welsh former international footballer who played as a forward. He is the only player to have scored a hat-trick in the Premier League, all three divisions of the English Football League, the League Cup, the FA Cup, and for his country in an international match.

Born in Zambia and raised in South Wales, Earnshaw joined Cardiff City as a Youth Training Scheme (YTS) trainee in 1997, and turned professional a year later. After making his debut at the age of sixteen, he spent a brief spell on loan with Greenock Morton before establishing himself in the first team. His prolific goalscoring saw him break several club records as he helped the club win promotion to the First Division in 2003. Scoring over 30 times in the First Division following promotion, he joined Premier League club West Bromwich Albion for £3.5 million in August 2004.

He played for several English clubs before later in his career playing in Israel, Canada, and the United States. After leaving Cardiff City in 2004, Earnshaw&#x27;s transfer fees totalled £12,650,000. He made his international debut for Wales in 2002 and scored 16 goals in 59 games for the national side, making him its eighth-highest all-time goalscorer.

==Early life==
One of five children, Earnshaw was born on the outskirts of the Zambian mining town of Mufulira on 6 April 1981 to Rita and English-born father David Earnshaw. His mother was a professional footballer in Zambia and later became a boxer and his father was a manager of a gold mine. His uncle Fidelis was also a professional footballer who played for Nkana and two of his cousins, Kalusha and Joel Bwalya, represented Zambia at international level. Kalusha later went on to become president of the Football Association of Zambia.

When Earnshaw was five, his family moved to Malawi where his father, took charge of a coal mine and his youngest son began attending St. Andrews School in Lilongwe. The school was a six-hour drive from the family home and Earnshaw was forced to fly to the school each Monday with his brother David and three sisters, Sharon, Joanne and Diane, and live there through the week before flying home each Friday. He went on to attend Viphya School where he was taught the Chewa language, already being able to speak Bemba and English.

The family&#x27;s stay was to be a short one again; in 1990, Earnshaw&#x27;s father contracted typhoid fever and died in May of that year. Following the death of her husband, Rita decided to move the family to Bedwas, a small Welsh town near Caerphilly where her sister lived, in 1991. Earnshaw later commented: &quot;It was the first time I had been away from Zambia. [...] It was much colder as well, just every little thing was different, everyone spoke English over here and although I could speak a little bit I had to learn. But when you&#x27;re a kid you just get on with it.&quot; While living in Bedwas he became friends with David Pipe who lived nearby.

It was in Wales that he began playing football, kicking a ball around with friends between and after classes at Cardinal Newman RC School, Pontypridd, the school he moved on to after a spell at St. Helen&#x27;s Primary. He grew up supporting Manchester United and also excelled at gymnastics and basketball. Cardinal Newman was a rugby union-playing school so Earnshaw&#x27;s first organised football match came at the age of 11 with local youth side Llanbradach. After a year, he joined GE Wales where he gained reputation as a prolific goalscorer, netting 80 times in a single season.

==Club career==
===Cardiff City===
Earnshaw&#x27;s youth team, GE Wales, played their home matches in Treforest on a pitch nearby to the youth team base of Cardiff City. In 1997, Earnshaw scored a hat-trick during a youth match that was being watched by Gavin Tait, then a youth team coach for Cardiff, who invited Earnshaw and some of his teammates to training and, on 1 August, he signed a one-year YTS contract at Ninian Park. He had also previously been watched by scouts from Manchester United. He progressed through Cardiff&#x27;s youth development programme, scoring over 47 goals for the club&#x27;s youth side during a single season including a hat-trick in a Welsh Youth Cup final victory over Llanelli, before being handed his debut in an FAW Invitation Cup match against Wrexham on 27 October 1997 at the age of sixteen. He made his professional debut on 6 September 1997 as a substitute in place of Scott Partridge during a 2–0 defeat to Millwall in the Football League Trophy. He made his league debut four months later, again as a substitute in place of Wayne O&#x27;Sullivan during a 0–0 draw with Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on 28 March 1998, and made four further league appearances during the 1997–98 season without scoring.

Four days prior to the start of the following season, Earnshaw signed his first full-time professional contract in August 1998 and was handed a start in the first game of the season in an away match against Hartlepool United. With Cardiff losing 1–0, Earnshaw scored a bicycle kick from ten yards out following a cross by John Williams to earn his side a point. However, after appearing in three further matches during the opening month of the season, he spent time away from Cardiff to attend trials with Middlesbrough under Bryan Robson and Fulham under Kevin Keegan. He returned to Cardiff but struggled to break into the side under manager Frank Burrows with Earnshaw later stating that he believed Burrows thought he would not &quot;make the grade.&quot; After making a single appearance at the start of the 1999–2000 season, Earnshaw was loaned to Scottish side Greenock Morton in January 2000 by Burrows to gain experience and &quot;toughen up&quot;, living above a local pub. Earnshaw later admitted that the experience at Morton helped him, commenting &quot;It made me realise that I needed to work hard at my game so I could show Cardiff City that I could become a good player.&quot; During his loan spell, he played three games in the Scottish Football League First Division, scoring twice, and one Scottish Cup tie against Rangers. Originally signing on an initial three-month loan deal, he was recalled by Cardiff manager Billy Ayre after just one month when he replaced Burrows in charge and made five appearances in the final three months of the season, scoring once in a 2–1 defeat to Bournemouth.

The following season proved to be a breakout year for Earnshaw as he established himself in the first team, scoring 25 goals in all competitions including hat-tricks in a league match against Torquay United and a third round FA Cup tie against Bristol Rovers. His form saw him receive Cardiff&#x27;s Young Player of the Year award and saw him named in the Football League Third Division PFA Team of the Year. In the 2002–03 season, Earnshaw scored on the opening day of the season in a 2–1 victory over Oldham Athletic but was used largely as a substitute in the opening month after manager Lennie Lawrence opted to play Andy Campbell after Earnshaw failed to score in pre-season. However, on 11 September 2002 he was handed a start against Boston United in the League Cup and scored a hat-trick. He went on to enjoy a prolific season, scoring two further hat-tricks in matches against Queens Park Rangers and Tranmere Rovers and also scored six braces, as Cardiff won promotion to the First Division after defeating Queens Park Rangers in the 2003 Football League Second Division play-off final at the Millennium Stadium. He finished the season with 35 goals in all competitions, despite scoring only once in his last eleven matches, breaking a club record for most goals scored in a single season which was previously held by Hughie Ferguson&#x27;s tally of 32 during the 1926–27 season. His 31 goals in league matches also broke a 56-year-old club record previously held by Stan Richards.
At the end of the season, Earnshaw was named Young Welsh Footballer of the Year, and was named in the PFA Division Two Team of the Year. Following the club&#x27;s promotion, Earnshaw continued his form and scored over 30 goals during his first season in the First Division, including a four-goal haul during a 5–0 victory over Gillingham and a hat-trick against Leyton Orient in the League Cup.

His continued goalscoring form attracted attention from numerous clubs, including Scottish side Celtic and Premier League clubs Fulham, Charlton Athletic and Aston Villa. Cardiff chairman Sam Hammam had strongly resisted any potential approaches for Earnshaw and at one point claimed that &quot;They would hang me in the city centre&quot; if he was sold.

===West Bromwich Albion===
However, at the start of the following season, Earnshaw was transferred from Cardiff to West Bromwich Albion for £3 million, a fee that could have reached a maximum of £3.62 million with performance-related add-ons. His agent Mel Eves was fined 30,000 Swiss francs (£12,250) by FIFA in July 2007 over his role in the transfer. Eves was found guilty of acting for both his client (Earnshaw) and the buying club (Albion) in the deal.

Earnshaw made his Albion début in a 3–0 defeat at Liverpool on 11 September 2004, coming on as a second-half substitute. He scored his first goals for Albion in his seventh appearance, netting twice in a 2–2 draw at Southampton on 6 November 2004 and scores in the club&#x27;s following two matches against Middlesbrough and Arsenal. His first and only Premier League hat-trick came against Charlton Athletic on 19 March 2005 after coming on as a substitute with 30 minutes remaining, scoring the first Premier League hat-trick scored by a West Bromwich Albion player. The hat-trick also meant the Earnshaw became the only player to have scored hat-tricks in all four professional divisions in England, the FA Cup, League Cup and in an international fixture. Although goals such as these helped the club retain their Premiership status, manager Bryan Robson preferred to use him from the bench as an impact player rather than as a starter. Nevertheless, Earnshaw finished as Albion&#x27;s top goalscorer for that season with 14 goals, earning him the Ronnie Allen trophy.

He remained in the squad for 2005–06, although West Brom signed several additional forwards including Diomansy Kamara and Nathan Ellington as competition for places became more significant. In December 2005, Earnshaw submitted two transfer requests, but both were rejected. However, in January 2006 manager Bryan Robson said that Earnshaw would be allowed to leave, assuming there was a fair transfer fee on offer. Following his departure, Earnshaw criticised Robson over his treatment at the club and the lack of first team opportunities given to him. Robson rejected Earnshaw&#x27;s claims and commented &quot;the percentages when I used Earnshaw compared to the points we collected just don&#x27;t stack up.&quot;

===Norwich City===
On transfer deadline day, 31 January 2006, Earnshaw signed a three-and-a-half-year contract for Norwich City for a fee of £2.75 million (rising to £3.5 million). Signed as a replacement for Dean Ashton, After making his debut in a 2–1 defeat to Ipswich Town on 5 February 2006, he opened his Norwich goal scoring account with a brace, late on in Norwich&#x27;s 3–0 home win against Brighton on 14 February 2006. Earnshaw went on to score six further goals in the remaining matches of the 2005–06 season. The following season, he enjoyed a prolific start to the campaign, including braces against Barnsley, Southend United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, and, by January 2007, Earnshaw was the top-goalscorer in the division with 17 goals. He suffered a severe groin injury in training soon after, that was expected to rule him out of action for the rest of the season. However, he returned to first team action in April 2007 to score his 18th and 19th goals of the season against Leicester City and Sheffield Wednesday.

===Derby County===
His goalscoring exploits for Norwich led newly promoted Premier League side Derby County to break their transfer record, previously held by the £3 million transfer of Seth Johnson from Crewe Alexandra, by signing Earnshaw from Norwich City for a fee of £3.5 million on 29 June 2007. He made his debut for the Rams in a 2–2 draw against Portsmouth on 11 August 2007. Earnshaw struggled to make an impact at Derby and was in and out of the side at the start of the season before being dropped. His first goal for the club came in a 4–1 FA Cup defeat to Preston North End on 26 January 2008, by which time the man who signed him, Billy Davies, had left the club and been replaced by Paul Jewell. It wasn&#x27;t until 28 April 2008 that he scored his first Premier League goal for the club, in the 6–2 home defeat to Arsenal. In a torrid season, Earnshaw made just seven starts in his debut season at Derby, with a further 17 appearances as sub. He was left out of the squad for the final game of the season against Reading when it was revealed that Jewell had accepted a bid from two unspecified clubs,
later revealed to be Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United, bringing to an end what Earnshaw later stated was one of his worst seasons in football.

===Nottingham Forest===

In May 2008, less than a year after signing for Derby, Earnshaw joined Nottingham Forest for £2.65 million, signing a three-year deal. He made his competitive debut in a 0–0 draw with Reading on 10 August 2008, scoring his first competitive goals for Forest in their League Cup first-round tie at home to Morecambe, getting two on 13 August 2008. Earnshaw&#x27;s first League goal for Forest came in their 3–2 victory over Watford in the Championship, at the City Ground on 23 August 2008. He scored his first hat trick for Nottingham Forest on 5 December 2009 in a 5–1 win over local rivals Leicester City.

The 2010–11 season saw Earnshaw struggle to find his feet early on despite some good performances, scoring only one in thirteen matches. His scoring picked up though, and he scored six goals in the last twelve games. This included two goals in the 5–2 win against Derby County at the City Ground, as well as the only goal in Forest&#x27;s first ever victory at Pride Park against Derby. Earnshaw scored Forest&#x27;s only goal in the 3–1 loss to Swansea City in the away leg of their play off semi final, also hitting the post in the dying minutes of the game, which would have levelled the scoreline at 2–2. In total he scored 43 goals in 111 appearances for Forest, making him one of their most successful strikers in recent years.

===Return to Cardiff City===

On 6 July 2011, Earnshaw rejoined boyhood club Cardiff City on a free transfer, following unsuccessful talks with Nottingham Forest regarding contract renewal. Earnshaw would become new Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay&#x27;s fourth free transfer signing since joining the Bluebirds from Watford.

Earnshaw made his second Cardiff debut in a 1–0 win over West Ham United on 7 August. Earnshaws&#x27; first goal since his return to the Bluebirds came the following Sunday in a 3–1 home victory over Bristol City in the Severnside derby. He scored his 200th career goal in a 1–1 draw with Burnley on 20 August, scoring the equaliser.

A change of the system at Cardiff and an off form Earnshaw saw him dropped to the bench to make way for Kenny Miller in a single man attack. Earnshaw made his first start since October in a 4–2 defeat to former club West Bromwich Albion on 7 January 2012, in which he scored. A league appearance didn&#x27;t feature until two more months where he found himself coming off the bench against Hull City, in a 3–0 defeat. He would continue making substitute appearance for the BlueBirds, mostly featuring in the dying minutes of the game, up to the season&#x27;s end. Cardiff City did make the play-offs, beaten 5–0 on aggregate by West Ham United, with Earnshaw making a brief appearance.

====Maccabi Tel Aviv (loan)====
On 20 September, after dropping down the pecking order at Cardiff, Earnshaw moved to Israel with Maccabi Tel Aviv on a season-long loan, and was given the number 19 shirt. After joining Maccabi Tel Aviv, Earnshaw believed joining the club would make him a better player once he returned to Cardiff City and said he had a chance to work with the club&#x27;s Sports Director Jordi Cruyff.

He made his club debut, coming on as substitute in a second half, in a 4–0 win over Hapoel Ironi Kiryat Shmona on 24 September 2012, and after two appearances, he scored his first goal in a 2–1 win over Ashdod 2 weeks later. His second goal came three months later when he scored a winner in a 2–1 win over Maccabi Netanya. Earnshaw spent part of the 2012 Israel-Gaza conflict in Tel Aviv, during which he expressed his shock at the city coming under rocket fire, saying: &quot;I looked over at these guys who had many years&#x27; service in the army. They knew exactly what was going on. One of them shouted that we had to take cover up by the side of the dressing rooms, so we just ran after them. Then we heard a loud bang of the Iron Dome – a new protection system used to intercept rockets. We then had to protect ourselves from all the shrapnel coming down&quot;.

On returning to Cardiff, manager Malky Mackay deemed Earnshaw surplus to requirements in January 2013, announcing that he would leave the club.

===Toronto FC===
On 28 February 2013, Earnshaw confirmed he had left Cardiff City to join Canadian Major League Soccer club Toronto FC. He made his debut two days later in a 1–0 away defeat to fellow Canadians Vancouver Whitecaps. The following week, on 9 March, Earnshaw scored two goals and first for the club in a 2–1 home victory over Sporting Kansas City, helping to earn new manager Ryan Nelsen his first coaching victory. Earnshaw was awarded MLS player of the week for his two-goal performance, becoming the first Toronto player to be given the honour since Danny Koevermans the previous summer.

===Blackpool===
On 21 March 2014, Earnshaw joined Championship side Blackpool on a short-term deal until the end of the 2013–14 season. He made a single appearance for the club, coming on as a substitute in place of Elliot Grandin during a 1–0 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 2014, before being released at the end of his contract.

===Chicago Fire===
On 15 August 2014, Earnshaw returned to MLS, joining Chicago Fire on a free transfer. Eight days later he scored his first goal for the Fire, heading in a Grant Ward cross in a 2–2 draw against his former club Toronto; a week later he made it two goals in two games when he headed in the only goal against Dallas at Chicago&#x27;s Toyota Park.

===Vancouver Whitecaps===
In February 2015, Earnshaw went on trial with Vancouver Whitecaps, playing in their 3–2 win over Stabæk. On 25 March, the Whitecaps announced his signing. Earnshaw made an immediate impact as a late substitute in his Whitecaps debut against the Portland Timbers three days later by scoring the winning goal in the 90th minute on his first touch of the ball.

His second goal was scored as a stoppage time substitute, scoring off of his second touch of the ball in a 3–0 defeat of the Houston Dynamo.

===Football playing retirement===

Earnshaw announced his retirement on 28 January 2016. He was named head coach of the Vancouver U-14 Pre-Residency team.

==International career==

Born in Zambia, Earnshaw chose to represent Wales at international level, stating &quot;I thought long and hard about what to do, but Wales was my country. It was where I grew up.&quot; Bobby Gould, who managed Wales until 1999, stated that he convinced Earnshaw to switch allegiance, helping him overcome concerns over potential playing time. He was capped by Wales at youth level won ten caps for the under-21 side, scoring once in a 4–1 defeat to Belarus. His exploits in Cardiff City&#x27;s promotion campaigns attracted the attention of national coach Mark Hughes.

Earnshaw became a key member of the Wales squad during the Euro 2004 qualifying campaign. He staked his claim for a regular slot in the starting line-up with a hat-trick in the 4–0 friendly win over Scotland in February 2004. At the end of 2003–04, Earnshaw was named in the First Division team of the year.

Because of racism directed to Earnshaw and others, from a Euro 2004 qualifying match, Serbia were handed a fine as a result of the abuse towards the Welsh football players.

He represented Wales on 59 occasions over a decade and on 25 May 2011 captained the side against the Scotland at the Nations Cup. On 6 September 2011, in a Euro 2012 qualifier against England, he came on as a substitute with his team 1–0 down, and missed an &#x27;open goal&#x27; from six yards, as England held on to win. Unused since August 2012, in the following March, Earnshaw stated that he was still available for selection by the national side, a message that he reiterated that October.
