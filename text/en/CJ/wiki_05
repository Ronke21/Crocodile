<text>Iman Darweesh Al Hams (Arabic: &quot;ʾĪmān Darwīsh al-Hamṣ&quot;; also &quot;Iyman&quot;) (1991 – 5 October 2004) was a 13-year-old Palestinian girl killed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) fire on 5 October 2004, in Rafah, Gaza Strip.

The IDF commander of the soldiers who shot her was accused by his comrades and Palestinian witnesses of using automatic fire to deliberately shoot her repeatedly, a subject which was brought into investigation. During trial, he expressed no regret over his actions and said he would have done the same even if the girl was a 3-year-old. His legal team argued that the &quot;confirmation of the kill&quot; after a suspect is shot was a standard Israeli military practice to eliminate terrorist threats. The commander was charged with illegal use of his weapon, conduct unbecoming an officer and perverting the course of justice by an Israeli military court but was found not guilty. Human rights groups cite her death as one of several incidents which illustrate a &quot;culture of impunity&quot; in the IDF.

==Overview of the incident==
Soldiers said they opened fire on the girl because they initially thought she was planting a bomb, although the tape recording of the radio conversation between soldiers at the scene reveals that, from the beginning, she was identified as a child and at no point was a bomb spoken about nor was she described as a threat. After she was hit, soldiers claimed the unit&#x27;s commanding officer went up to her and kept on shooting her, despite their pleas to stop. No explosives or weapons were found on the girl&#x27;s body. A search of her bag revealed that it was filled with textbooks.

===Palestinian witnesses===
According to Umar Abu Khalifa, 25, &quot;Israeli soldiers stormed the area, the girl left the bag and tried to run. Bullets hit the (girl&#x27;s) bag and then soldiers opened fire on the girl.&quot;

Palestinian witnesses reported that it was more than an hour before Israeli troops would allow medics to evacuate the body in an ambulance. At least fifteen bullets were found in the girl&#x27;s body by Palestinian hospital officials.

Dr. Mohammed al-Hams, who inspected the child&#x27;s body told The Guardian newspaper that:&quot;She has at least 17 bullets in several parts of the body, all along the chest, hands, arms, legs ... The bullets were large and shot from a close distance. The most serious injuries were to her head. She had three bullets in the head.

Ehab Hams, an older brother of the slain girl, expressed his distrust of Israeli military justice: &quot;We demand the prosecution of Iman&#x27;s killer (but) we do not trust the Israeli judicial system.&quot; He added, &quot;My sister was an innocent little girl.&quot;

===Israeli documentary and audio recording of internal communications===
A documentary screened nationwide on Ilana Dayan&#x27;s Uvda (&quot;Fact&quot;) investigative program on Israel&#x27;s Channel 2 aired an audio recording of the internal communications between soldiers at the post at the time of the incident.

According to the audio recording, the soldiers of the Givati Brigade identified the victim as &quot;a girl, about 10 years old&quot;, describing her as looking &quot;scared to death&quot;. Another soldier is heard saying, &quot;Our forces are attacking her&quot;, and a lookout says &quot;One of the positions has taken her down.&quot; The Givati Brigade company commander, Captain R., is then heard saying &quot;We operated on her. Yes, it seems she has been hit.&quot; He later states that he &quot;verified&quot; the killing, and clarifies his actions by stating that:&quot;This is commander. Anything that&#x27;s mobile, that moves in the zone, even if it&#x27;s a three-year-old, needs to be killed. Over.&quot;

Israeli soldiers interviewed in the documentary, and whose anonymity was maintained, submitted that their commander had knowingly shot the girl in the head at close range and then emptied his magazine of bullets into her body to &quot;confirm the kill.&quot; One of the soldiers said: &quot;We saw her from a distance of 70 meters. She was fired at ... from the outpost. She fled and was wounded.&quot; The soldiers then explained how while Iman was lying wounded about 70 m from the Israeli guard post, the commander fired two bullets at her head from close range. They added that the commander returned to her body again, put his weapon on the automatic setting, and emptied his entire magazine into her body, disregarding their objections over the walkie-talkie.

One of the soldiers said:&quot;We couldn&#x27;t believe what he had done. Our hearts ached for her. Just a 13-year-old girl ... How do you spray a girl from close range? He was hot for a long time to take out terrorists and shot the girl to relieve pressure.&quot;

==Investigations==

===First internal investigation===
On 11 October 2004, the BBC reported that Israel&#x27;s top military prosecutor was investigating the army commander for repeatedly firing at the lifeless body of the young girl. The report stated that according to Haaretz newspaper, &quot;confirming the kill&quot; (i.e. shooting combatants at close range to make sure they are dead) goes against Israeli military regulations governing the rules of engagement. On 13 October 2004, CBS reported that the army had suspended the officer during the investigation. On 15 October 2004, it was reported that the officer was cleared of responsibility in the shooting.

The BBC reported that army officials had accepted the commander&#x27;s claim that &quot;he fired into the ground near the girl after coming under fire in a dangerous area,&quot; but that they did not explain why the officer shot into the ground rather than at the source of the fire.

Excerpts from the army statement read:&quot;The investigation did not find that the company or the company commander had acted unethically ... The investigation concluded that the behaviour of the company commander from an ethical point of view does not warrant his removal from his position.&quot;

The officer was nevertheless temporarily suspended due to his poor relations with the soldiers under his command and operational failures. It was further noted that a decision on his career in the army would be given by the end of the week.

Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the army chief of staff, said repeatedly that the officer had acted properly under the circumstances. The Israeli military police launched a separate investigation.

===Second internal investigation===
On 18 November 2004, the Israeli army requested the family&#x27;s permission to exhume Hams&#x27; body. The earlier accusations made by the soldiers against their commanding officer of engaging in the outlawed practice of &quot;verifying the kill&quot; had regained currency. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that it was not known whether the girl was already dead or had merely been wounded before being repeatedly shot again. That same month, the army formally charged the officer with two counts of illegally using his weapon, and one count each of obstruction of justice, conduct unbecoming an officer and improper use of authority.

Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon conceded that the first military investigation had been &quot;a grave failure&quot;. The indictment against the officer alleged that the first investigation was the subject of an attempted coverup.

===Military tribunal===
After the commencement of the military tribunal, the al-Hams family and the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel (PCATI) petitioned the Israeli High Court of Justice in January 2005 to request that the investigation be turned over to civilian authorities. The court declined the request in February 2005.

Referred to in public only as Lieutenant R., (or Captain R.), the officer maintained that when he reached the girl&#x27;s body, he came under fire from Palestinian militants at least away and shot at the ground to deter the fire. In an interview with the Associated Press, an Israeli military official stated that a soldier in the observation tower claimed the officer&#x27;s fire was aimed at the girl&#x27;s body and could offer no explanation as to why the officer shot into the ground rather than at the source of the fire.

Lieutenant R. was released from custody in February 2005 after a key prosecution witness, another IDF lieutenant, who had told the military police investigation that he saw R. fire two individual bullets, followed by a volley, into Al-Hams&#x27; body, recanted his testimony under intensive cross examination. Earlier, another lookout also retracted parts of his initial testimony against R, attributed by human rights groups to heavy behind-the-scenes military pressure.
 Though Lieutenant R. had admitted firing two shots into the girl&#x27;s body from close range to &quot;verify the kill&quot;, he denied shooting subsequently. His lawyers, Yoav Meni and Elad Eisenberg, said the practice of &quot;verifying the kill&quot; was used regularly by the IDF to eliminate immediate threats.

===Acquittal===
On 15 November 2005, a military tribunal acquitted Captain R., clearing him of all the charges against him.

Upon hearing the verdict, Captain R., burst into tears and turned to the public benches and said: &quot;I told you I was innocent.&quot;

Iman&#x27;s father, Samir al-Hams, responded to the verdict by saying that from the outset there was no intention to hold the officer accountable:&quot;They did not charge him with Iman&#x27;s murder, only with small offences, and now they say he is innocent of those even though he shot my daughter so many times ... This was the cold-blooded murder of a girl. The soldier murdered her once and the court has murdered her again. What is the message? They are telling their soldiers to kill Palestinian children.&quot;

The Palestinian National Authority condemned the verdict.

===Military police investigation into first investigation===
In February 2006, Ha&#x27;aretz newspaper reported that a military police internal investigation found that there were major failures in the October 2004 investigation into the killing of al-Hams.

Two reservist officers appointed by Military Police Commander Brigadier General Roni Benny to examine the military police&#x27;s conduct during the investigation determined that investigators acted unprofessionally and with negligence. The two officers criticized the decision not to appoint a special investigation team led by higher-ranking, more experienced officials and also noted that the incident was not appropriately documented by the investigation. The military police officer in charge of the investigation was reprimanded and the head of the investigation team was censured.

===Compensation and promotion to rank of major===
Subsequent to his acquittal, Captain R. was promoted to the rank of major. In March 2006, he received 82,000 New Israel Shekels (roughly $17,000) to compensate him for the cost of his defense and time spent in jail. Captain R. also filed a libel suit against Ilana Dayan and the Telad production company.
The district court accepted the suit and awarded him 300,000 shekels in damages. The decision was overturned in part by the Supreme Court, which ruled that Telad should pay only 100,000. The court ruled Dayan did not know that Captain R. was unaware that he was pursuing a child, and so should not be held liable for the news report.

== Further legal actions ==
In 2010 a Jerusalem district court found the claim that &quot;Captain R&quot; had shot Al Hams multiple times to &quot;verify&quot; her death, made by Ilana Dayan in her Uvda (&quot;Fact&quot;) TV show on Channel 2, to be libelous, and required them to air a correction and for production company Telad to pay ₪300,000. A 2012 decision by the Israeli Supreme Court acquitted Dayan and reduced the damages to ₪100,000, finding that the statements were &quot;correct at the time of their broadcast&quot;, based on honest belief, verified facts and credible sources. The court found that &quot;Captain R&quot; had been unaware that the death he was running out to verify had been that of a 13-year-old girl, but that Ilana Dayan was unaware of this.

<doc id="1080218" wikidata="Q582027" url="?curid=1080218" title="Metamatic">
<text>Metamatic is the debut solo album by John Foxx, released in 1980. It was his first solo project following his split with Ultravox the previous year. A departure from the mix of synthesizers and conventional rock instrumentation on that band&#x27;s work, &quot;Metamatic&quot; was purely electronic in sound. The name &#x27;Metamatic&#x27; comes from a painting machine by kinetic artist Jean Tinguely, first exhibited at the Paris Biennial in 1959. The album peaked at #18 on the UK Albums Chart.

== Production and style ==
&quot;Metamatic&quot; was recorded at Pathway Studios, a small eight-track studio in Islington, and was engineered by Gareth Jones. Foxx&#x27;s electronic equipment included an ARP Odyssey, an Elka &#x27;String Machine&#x27; and a Roland CR-78 drum machine. Several of the synth parts were played by John Wesley-Barker. Dub music was an influence on the production.

The lyrics were heavily influenced by the writings of J. G. Ballard. Six of the tracks referenced automobiles or motorways, most obviously &quot;Underpass&quot; and &quot;No-One Driving&quot;. (Foxx re-worked the former track as &quot;Overpass&quot; on the live &quot;Subterranean Omnidelic Exotour&quot; in 1998). The song &quot;A New Kind of Man&quot; is about a man stepping into a film screen, which inspired the cover art of the album. The song &quot;He&#x27;s a Liquid&quot; was influenced by a still from a Japanese horror film depicting a suit draped across a chair in such a way as to suggest that the wearer had liquified; Foxx&#x27;s lyrics also alluded to the &#x27;fluidity&#x27; of human relationships. The final track, &quot;Touch and Go&quot;, included psychedelic aspects.

Although Foxx had performed &quot;He&#x27;s a Liquid&quot; and &quot;Touch and Go&quot; live with Ultravox before leaving the band in 1979, the band was not credited for them on &quot;Metamatic&quot;. When Ultravox adapted the tune from &quot;Touch and Go&quot; for the song &quot;Mr. X&quot; on &quot;Vienna&quot; (1980), their first album following Foxx&#x27;s departure, Foxx was not credited.

== Release and aftermath ==
&quot;Metamatic&quot; spent seven weeks in the UK charts, peaking at #18. The album was generally well received by critics and is still cited as his most influential solo release.

===Singles and reissues===
&quot;Underpass&quot; was released as an edited single two weeks before the album (length: 3:18), making #31 in the UK charts and appearing on a number of electropop compilations of the time. Its B-side was a non-album instrumental, &quot;Film One&quot;. In March 1980 a re-recorded version of &quot;No-One Driving&quot; was released as a double single with three other non-album tracks: &quot;Glimmer&quot;, &quot;Mr. No&quot; and &quot;This City&quot;, reaching #32.

In July 1980, Foxx released a single with new songs on both sides, &quot;Burning Car&quot; b/w &quot;20th Century&quot;, making #35. He issued one more single-only release in October 1980, the transitional &quot;Miles Away&quot; b/w &quot;A Long Time&quot;, which provided a foretaste of the more fully produced sound of his next album, &quot;The Garden&quot; (1981). All these non-album tracks have appeared on various John Foxx compilations and reissues of &quot;Metamatic&quot;; the 1993 CD version of the album also included &quot;Young Love&quot;, a previously unreleased track recorded in 1979. A &#x27;definitive&#x27; two-CD reissue of the album was released in September 2007 which was intended to bring together all the &quot;Metamatic&quot;-era material, plus previously unavailable tracks, onto one bonus CD. Another re-mastered edition was released as a 3CD Deluxe Edition in 2018. This included fifteen instrumentals on disc three, as the new reissue project grew to forty-nine tracks across three CDs.

Foxx&#x27;s record label and his official website are also named Metamatic.

===Metal Beat interview===
An in-depth interview with Foxx by Steve Malins about the making of &quot;Metamatic&quot; is the subject of a double-CD album &quot;Metal Beat&quot; released in 2007. The interview includes extracts from demos of No-One Driving, &quot;Touch and Go&quot; and &quot;Like A Miracle&quot; and an extended version of &quot;Plaza&quot;, together with some early experiments by Foxx with drum machines and analogue synthesisers and tracks retrieved from two 1980 tapes marked &quot;music for film&quot; and &quot;instrumentals&quot;. A 30-second piece entitled &quot;Jane&quot; is also included.

==Critical reception==
Upon its release in 1980 the album received positive reviews. &quot;Record Mirror&quot; gave the album a 5 out of 5 rating. &quot;Smash Hits&quot; wrote that &quot;this restrained and melodic album of synthesised music and (surprise, surprise) futuristic visions comes as an impressive step forward&quot; (from the &quot;chronically pretentious Ultravox&quot;).

Trouser Press wrote: &quot;Metamatic is Foxx’s first venture alone into the world of synthesizers (...) In emulation of his own work and Conny Plank’s production on Ultravox’s Systems of Romance, Foxx (aided by another synthesist and a bassist) finds the perfect counterpart for his themes of alienation and dislocation in sterile, minimalist electronic sounds. His vocals are oddly distant, like echoes, but the record has an honesty and directness that are quite affecting.&quot;

From retrospective reviews, in a Record Collector review of the 2007 reissue Ian Shirley concluded: &quot;To be frank, however, Metamatic has not worn well. Although the analogue synth textures work well on the singles and tracks such as Plaza, Metal Beat and Touch &amp; Go, the rhythms of the drum machines and overall sound of A New Kind Of Man and Tidal Wave are very dated. Considering how adventurous and warm the Human League’s Reproduction and Travelogue from the same period are, Metamatic is the sound of musical austerity.&quot;

The 2018 reissue received a positive review by Kieron Tyler: &quot;&quot;Metamatic&quot; feels as much about melody as the then-current musical tools. “He’s a Liquid” and “Touch and Go” had been played live by Ultravox so, clearly, Foxx was honing some of the album’s songs before they were recorded; there was pre-planning. There’s also a timelessness, born from to the combination of Foxx’s chops as a songwriter and the use of pre-digital synths which had to be configured manually. The sounds and arrangements Foxx came up with were his own. The only track which has dated is “Metal Beat” due to its borrowings from elements of Kraftwerk&#x27;s “Showroom Dummies” and “The Robots”. Overall, Metamatic is poppy, romantic, and refracts the aura of concrete-filled urban environments and the power they exert.&quot;

<text>The Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA) is an autonomous institution set up by the University Grants Commission of India to promote nucleation and growth of active groups in astronomy and astrophysics in Indian universities. IUCAA is located in the University of Pune campus next to the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, which operates the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. IUCAA has a campus designed by Indian architect Charles Correa.

==History==
After the founding of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) by Prof. Govind Swarup, a common research facility for astronomy and astrophysics was proposed by Dr. Yash Pal of the planning commission. Working on this idea, astrophysicist Prof. Jayant Narlikar, along with Ajit Kembhavi and Naresh Dadhich set up IUCAA within the Pune University campus in 1988.

In 2002, IUCAA initiated a nationwide campaign to popularize astronomy and astrophysics in colleges and universities. IUCAA arranged visitor programs for universities in Nagpur (Maharashtra), Thiruvalla (Kerala), Siliguri (West Bengal) and others, along with a tie-up with the Ferguson college, Pune.

In 2004, IUCAA set up the &quot;Muktangan Vidnyan Shodhika&quot; (Exlporatorium), a science popularization initiative, with a grant from the Pu La Deshpande foundation. The center is open to all school students from Pune. IUCAA was declared the nodal center for India to coordinate the year-long celebrations for the International Year of Astronomy.

IUCAA was headed for its first decade by Prof. Jayant Narlikar, followed by Prof. Naresh Dadhich and Prof. Ajit Kembhavi. From September 2015, the Director is Prof. Somak Raychaudhury.

==Research==
Scientists at IUCAA carry out research in a wide range of areas in astronomy, astrophysics and physics. IUCAA has active research groups in fields like classical and quantum gravity, cosmology, gravitational waves, optical and radio astronomy, Solar System physics and instrumentation.

===Facilities===
IUCAA, along with Persistent Systems, Pune, operates the Virtual Observatory project. The observatory provides users access to raw observational data along with advanced processing software designed by engineers at Persistent.

IUCAA also maintains Girawali Observatory which is about 80 km from Pune city, off Pune-Nasik Road and near the historical Junnar town. In addition to catering to the needs of astronomers in general, this observatory is unique in setting aside a certain amount of time specifically for training as well as observational proposals arising from Indian Universities. The telescope has a primary mirror of diameter 2 meter, f/3 and a secondary of 60 cm, f/10. IUCAA Faint Object Spectrograph &amp; Camera (IFOSC) is the main instrument available on the telescope&#x27;s direct Cassegrain port currently.

IUCAA, along with the Raman Research Institute and Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, declared a proposal to take a ten percent stake in the Large Telescope Project, which would allow Indian astronomers access to major upcoming observatories such as the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT), the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and the European Extremely Large Telescope (EELT).

==Science popularization==
The SciPop initiative was set up by Prof. Jayant Narlikar along with N. C. Rana and Arvind Paranjpe. SciPop, based out of the Muktangan Vidnyan Shodhika building, provides educational facilities for school students, teachers and amateur astronomers. IUCAA organizes the open Science day program every year on 28 February, in which members of the general public can visit the institute to take a look at ongoing research and contemporary work happening elsewhere in the world. IUCAA was one of the few Indian research institutes to start a science popularization program, and other organisations such as the Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Astrophysics, and TIFR, Mumbai started similar public outreach programmes in the wake of its success.

<doc id="1080220" wikidata="Q316140" url="?curid=1080220" title="Article 48 (Weimar Constitution)">
<text>Article 48 of the constitution of the Weimar Republic of Germany (1919–1933) allowed the Reich president, under certain circumstances, to take emergency measures without the prior consent of the Reichstag. This power came to be understood to include the promulgation of emergency decrees. It was used frequently by Reich President Friedrich Ebert of the Social Democratic Party to deal with both political unrest and economic emergencies. Later, under President Paul von Hindenburg and the presidential cabinets, Article 48 was called on more and more often to bypass a politically fractured parliament and to rule without its consent. After the Nazi Party&#x27;s rise to power in the early 1930s, the law allowed Chancellor Adolf Hitler, with decrees issued by Hindenburg, to create a totalitarian dictatorship by seemingly legal means.

== Text ==

== History ==
=== Background ===
The Weimar National Assembly, which was responsible for writing a constitution for a new, democratic Germany following the overthrow of the Hohenzollern monarchy at the end of World War I, had the task of producing a document that would be accepted by both conservatives who wanted to keep the semi-constitutional monarchy of the Empire and people on the left who were looking for a socialist or even communist government. The Weimar Constitution&#x27;s framers intended Article 48 to allow a strong executive within the parliamentary republic that could bypass the slower legislative process in times of crisis.

The article allowed the Reich president to use the armed forces to compel any federal state to obey the lawful obligations placed on it by the Reich government. In addition, if &quot;security and order&quot; were endangered, the president could take measures, including use of the military, to restore order; he could also suspend certain enumerated fundamental rights: personal liberty, inviolability of the home, of the mail and other communications, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and of association, and the inviolability of property. The president had to inform the Reichstag of any such measures, and the Reichstag could revoke them by a majority vote. Since under Article 50 of the Weimar Constitution the president&#x27;s decrees had to be counter-signed by the chancellor or &quot;competent national minister&quot;, use of Article 48 required agreement between president and chancellor. There was to be a law passed by the parliament to determine the &quot;details&quot; of the powers granted the president, but none was ever written.
=== Under President Ebert ===
In the early years of the Republic, following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in June 1919, the combination of reparations payments, the occupation of the Ruhr by French and Belgian troops between 1921 and 1923, and the resulting hyperinflation led to economic turmoil and political unrest from both the left and right. To cope with the crises, Friedrich Ebert, a Social Democrat and the Republic&#x27;s first president, used Article 48 on 136 occasions, although he always based invoking the act on agreements between himself, the government and parliament. In October 1923, when the Communist Party of Germany entered the Social Democratic-led governments of Saxony and Thuringia with hidden revolutionary intentions, Ebert used a &quot;Reichsexekution&quot; under Article 48 to send troops into the two states to remove the Communists from the governments. Ebert later granted Chancellor Wilhelm Cuno considerable latitude under Article 48 to deal with inflation and matters related to the Reichsmark. It was a more controversial use of the power because it was not clear that the constitutional article was meant to be used to handle economic issues. The Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924 also used Article 48 to abolish the jury system as a cost saving measure and replace it with the mixed system of judges and lay judges that still exists today.

=== Under President Hindenburg ===
Article 48 was used by President Paul von Hindenburg in 1930 to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. During the spring and summer, Chancellor Heinrich Brüning found his government unable to obtain a parliamentary majority for its financial reform bill, which was voted down by the Reichstag&quot;,&quot; but the government did not seriously try to negotiate with the parliament to find a &quot;modus vivendi&quot;. Instead, Brüning asked Hindenburg to invoke Article 48 in order to promulgate the bill as an emergency decree and thereby give Brüning&#x27;s government the authority to act without the consent of the Reichstag. When Hindenburg gave his authorization and issued the decree, it was the first time that a bill that had been legislatively rejected was later promulgated by way of executive decree, a tactic whose constitutionality has been questioned. On 18 July 1930 the Reichstag repudiated the decree by a vote of 236 to 221, with the Social Democrats, Nazis, German National People&#x27;s Party and Communists voting in favor. Under Article 48, the vote by a majority of the Reichstag members invalidated the presidential decree. Brüning then asked Hindenburg to dissolve parliament and call for new elections. The Reichstag was accordingly dissolved on 18 July and new elections were scheduled for 14 September 1930. 

The September 1930 election resulted in increased representation in the Reichstag for the Communists and, most dramatically the Nazis, at the expense of the moderate middle-class parties. Forming a parliamentary majority became even more difficult for Brüning. In fact, just to conduct the normal business of government, he was forced to invoke Article 48 many more times between 1930 and 1932. Subsequent governments under chancellors Franz von Papen and Kurt von Schleicher during the tumultuous year 1932 obtained decrees from Hindenburg under Article 48 when they too found it impossible to obtain a parliamentary majority as the extremist parties on the left and right gained power. Altogether, Article 48 was invoked by Hindenburg 109 times from 1930 to 1932:
The invocation of Article 48 by successive governments helped seal the fate of the Weimar Republic. While Brüning&#x27;s first invocation of an emergency decree may have been well-intentioned, the power to rule by decree was increasingly used not in response to a specific emergency but as a substitute for parliamentary leadership. The excessive use of the decree power and the fact that successive chancellors were no longer responsible to the Reichstag probably played a significant part in the loss of public confidence in constitutional democracy, in turn leading to the rise of the extremist parties.

===Nazi use===

On 30 January 1933, Adolf Hitler was appointed chancellor. Lacking a majority in the Reichstag, he formed a coalition with the national conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). Not long afterwards, he called elections for 5 March. Six days before the election, on 27 February, the Reichstag fire damaged the house of parliament in Berlin. Claiming that the fire was the first step in a Communist revolution, the Nazis used the fire as a pretext to induce President Hindenburg to sign the Reichstag Fire Decree, officially the Presidential Decree for the Protection of People and State ().

Under the decree, which was issued on the basis of Article 48, the government was given authority to curtail constitutional rights including habeas corpus, free expression of opinion, freedom of the press, rights of assembly, and the privacy of postal, telegraphic and telephonic communications. Constitutional restrictions on searches and confiscation of property were likewise rescinded.

The Reichstag Fire Decree was one of the first steps the Nazis took toward the establishment of a one-party dictatorship in Germany. With key government posts in the hands of Nazis and with the constitutional protections on civil liberties suspended by the decree, the Nazis were able to use their control of the police to intimidate and arrest their opposition, in particular the Communists. Due to the use of Article 48, the repression had the mark of legality.

The 5 March 1933 elections gave the Nazi-DNVP coalition a narrow majority in the Reichstag. On 23 March the Nazis were nevertheless able to maneuver the passage of the Enabling Act by the required two-thirds parliamentary majority, effectively abrogating the authority of the Reichstag and placing its authority in the hands of the cabinet (in effect, the chancellor, Adolf Hitler). This had the effect of giving Hitler dictatorial powers.

Over the years, Hitler used Article 48 to give his dictatorship the stamp of legality. Thousands of his decrees were based explicitly on the Reichstag Fire Decree, and hence on Article 48, allowing Hitler to rule under what amounted to martial law. It was a major reason why Hitler never formally repealed the Weimar Constitution, though it had effectively been rendered a dead letter with the passage of the Enabling Act.

== Effect on post-war constitutions ==
The misuse of Article 48 was fresh in the minds of the framers of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. They decided to significantly curb the powers of the president, to the point that the office, unlike its Weimar predecessor, has little &quot;de facto&quot; executive power. Also, to prevent a government from being forced to rely on decrees to carry on normal business, they stipulated that a chancellor may only be removed from office via a constructive vote of no confidence, which requires that a prospective successor already command a majority before a chancellor can be voted out of office.

Article 48 also influenced the framers of the French Constitution of 1958, whose Article 16 similarly allows the president of France to rule by decree in emergencies. The French article, however, includes much stronger safeguards against misuse than was the case in Weimar. The president is required to consult with the prime minister and the presidents of both houses of parliament before issuing emergency decrees; these decrees, in turn, cannot be used to suspend civil rights and liberties, but are instead required to be designed to restore the normal rules of the Constitution. That is, the president cannot use Article 16 as a substitute for parliamentary confidence. Article 16 also prohibits the dissolution of the National Assembly while an emergency is in effect, while the parliament retains the right to submit emergency decrees to the Constitutional Council, which has the power to invalidate them if the conditions necessary for the article&#x27;s invocation no longer exist.

==Interpretation==
The text of the Article 48 neither precisely defined the kind of emergency that would justify its use nor expressly granted to the president the power to enact, issue, or otherwise promulgate legislation. However, such an inherent presidential legislative power was clearly implied, since the Article expressly gave the Reichstag the power to cancel the emergency decree by a simple majority vote. Such a parliamentary power implied that a decree could, either by its express terms or its operation, impinge on the Reichstag&#x27;s constitutional function.

Article 48 required the president to inform the Reichstag immediately of the issuance of the emergency decree and gave the Reichstag the power to nullify the emergency decree by simple majority action. The Reichsrat, the upper house, was not involved in the process at all. If the Reichstag nullified the decree, the president could retaliate by using the power granted him under Article 25 to dissolve the Reichstag and call for new elections within 60 days.

<text>Nitrogenases are enzymes () that are produced by certain bacteria, such as cyanobacteria (blue-green bacteria) and rhizobacteria. These enzymes are responsible for the reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3). Nitrogenases are the only family of enzymes known to catalyze this reaction, which is a step in the process of nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation is required for all forms of life, with nitrogen being essential for the biosynthesis of molecules (nucleotides, amino acids) that create plants, animals and other organisms. They are encoded by the Nif genes or homologs. They are related to protochlorophyllide reductase.

==Classification and structure==

Although the equilibrium formation of ammonia from molecular hydrogen and nitrogen has an overall negative enthalpy of reaction (formula_1), the activation energy is very high (formula_2). Nitrogenase acts as a catalyst, reducing this energy barrier such that the reaction can take place at ambient temperatures.

A usual assembly consists of two components:

# The homodimeric Fe-only protein, the reductase which has a high reducing power and is responsible for a supply of electrons.
# The heterotetrameric MoFe protein, a nitrogenase which uses the electrons provided to reduce N2 to NH3. In some assemblies it is replaced by a homologous alternative.

===Reductase===
The Fe protein, the dinitrogenase reductase or NifH, is a dimer of identical subunits which contains one [Fe4S4] cluster and has a mass of approximately 60-64kDa. The function of the Fe protein is to transfer electrons from a reducing agent, such as ferredoxin or flavodoxin to the nitrogenase protein. Ferredoxin or flavodoxin can be reduced by one of six mechanisms: 1. by a , 2. by a bi-directional hydrogenase, 3. in a photosynthetic reaction center, 4. by coupling electron flow to dissipation of the proton motive force, 5. by electron bifurcation, or 6. by a . The transfer of electrons requires an input of chemical energy which comes from the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP also causes a conformational change within the nitrogenase complex, bringing the Fe protein and MoFe protein closer together for easier electron transfer.

===Nitrogenase===
The MoFe protein is a heterotetramer consisting of two α subunits and two β subunits, with a mass of approximately 240-250kDa. The MoFe protein also contains two iron–sulfur clusters, known as P-clusters, located at the interface between the α and β subunits and two FeMo cofactors, within the α subunits. The oxidation state of Mo in these nitrogenases was formerly thought Mo(V), but more recent evidence is for Mo(III). (Molybdenum in other enzymes is generally bound to molybdopterin as fully oxidized Mo(VI)).

* The core (Fe8S7) of the P-cluster takes the form of two [Fe4S3] cubes linked by a central sulfur atom. Each P-cluster is linked to the MoFe protein by six cysteine residues.
* Each FeMo cofactor (Fe7MoS9C) consists of two non-identical clusters: [Fe4S3] and [MoFe3S3], which are linked by three sulfide ions. Each FeMo cofactor is covalently linked to the α subunit of the protein by one cysteine residue and one histidine residue.

Electrons from the Fe protein enter the MoFe protein at the P-clusters, which then transfer the electrons to the FeMo cofactors. Each FeMo cofactor then acts as a site for nitrogen fixation, with N2 binding in the central cavity of the cofactor.

==== Variations ====
The MoFe protein can be replaced by alternative nitrogenases in environments low in the Mo cofactor. Two types of such nitrogenases are known: the vanadium–iron (VFe; &quot;Vnf&quot;) type and the iron–iron (FeFe; &quot;Anf&quot;) type. Both form an assembly of two α subunits, two β subunits, and two δ (sometimes γ) subunits. The delta subunits are homologous to each other, and the alpha and beta subunits themselves are homologous to the ones found in MoFe nitrogenase. The gene clusters are also homologous, and these subunits are interchangeable to some degree. All nitrogenases use a similar Fe-S core cluster, and the variations come in the cofactor metal.

The Anf nitrogenase in &quot;Azotobacter vinelandii&quot; is organized in an &quot;anfHDGKOR&quot; operon. This operon still requires some of the Nif genes to function. An engineered minimal 10-gene operon that incorporates these additional essential genes has been constructed.

== Mechanism ==

=== General mechanism ===

Nitrogenase is an enzyme responsible for catalyzing nitrogen fixation, which is the reduction of nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) and a process vital to sustaining life on Earth. There are three types of nitrogenase found in various nitrogen-fixing bacteria: molybdenum (Mo) nitrogenase, vanadium (V) nitrogenase, and iron-only (Fe) nitrogenase. Molybdenum nitrogenase, which can be found in diazotrophs such as legume-associated rhizobia, is the nitrogenase that has been studied the most extensively and thus is the most well characterized. Vanadium nitrogenase and iron-only nitrogenase can both be found in select species of Azotobacter as an alternative nitrogenase. Equations 1 and 2 show the balanced reactions of nitrogen fixation in molybdenum nitrogenase and vanadium nitrogenase respectively.


All nitrogenases are two-component systems made up of Component I (also known as dinitrogenase) and Component II (also known as dinitrogenase reductase). Component I is a MoFe protein in molybdenum nitrogenase, a VFe protein in vanadium nitrogenase, and an Fe protein in iron-only nitrogenase. Component II is a Fe protein that contains the Fe-S cluster., which transfers electrons to Component I. Component I contains 2 metal clusters: the P-cluster, and the FeMo-cofactor (FeMo-co). Mo is replaced by V or Fe in vanadium nitrogenase and iron-only nitrogenase respectively. During catalysis, 2 equivalents of MgATP are hydrolysed which helps to decrease the potential of the to the Fe-S cluster and drive reduction of the P-cluster, and finally to the FeMo-co, where reduction of N2 to NH3 takes place.

=== Lowe-Thorneley kinetic model ===
The reduction of nitrogen to two molecules of ammonia is carried out at the FeMo-co of Component I after the sequential addition of proton and electron equivalents from Component II. Steady state, freeze quench, and stopped-flow kinetics measurements carried out in the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s by Lowe, Thorneley, and others provided a kinetic basis for this process. The Lowe-Thorneley (LT) kinetic model was developed from these experiments and documents the eight correlated proton and electron transfers required throughout the reaction. Each intermediate stage is depicted as En where n = 0–8, corresponding to the number of equivalents transferred. The transfer of four equivalents are required before the productive addition of N2, although reaction of E3 with N2 is also possible. Notably, nitrogen reduction has been shown to require 8 equivalents of protons and electrons as opposed to the 6 equivalents predicted by the balanced chemical reaction.

=== Intermediates E0 through E4 ===
Spectroscopic characterization of these intermediates has allowed for greater understanding of nitrogen reduction by nitrogenase, however, the mechanism remains an active area of research and debate. Briefly listed below are spectroscopic experiments for the intermediates before the addition of nitrogen:

E0 – This is the resting state of the enzyme before catalysis begins. EPR characterization shows that this species has a spin of 3/2.

E1 – The one electron reduced intermediate has been trapped during turnover under N2. Mӧssbauer spectroscopy of the trapped intermediate indicates that the FeMo-co is integer spin greater than 1.

E2 – This intermediate is proposed to contain the metal cluster in its resting oxidation state with the two added electrons stored in a bridging hydride and the additional proton bonded to a sulfur atom. Isolation of this intermediate in mutated enzymes shows that the FeMo-co is high spin and has a spin of 3/2.

E3 – This intermediate is proposed to be the singly reduced FeMo-co with one bridging hydride and one hydride.

E4 – Termed the Janus intermediate after the Roman god of transitions, this intermediate is positioned after exactly half of the electron proton transfers and can either decay back to E0 or proceed with nitrogen binding and finish the catalytic cycle. This intermediate is proposed to contain the FeMo-co in its resting oxidation state with two bridging hydrides and two sulfur bonded protons. This intermediate was first observed using freeze quench techniques with a mutated protein in which residue 70, a valine amino acid, is replaced with isoleucine. This modification prevents substrate access to the FeMo-co. EPR characterization of this isolated intermediate shows a new species with a spin of ½. ENDOR experiments have provided insight into the structure of this intermediate, revealing the presence of two bridging hydrides. 95Mo and 57Fe ENDOR show that the hydrides bridge between two iron centers. Cryoannealing of the trapped intermediate at -20 °C results in the successive loss of two hydrogen equivalents upon relaxation, proving that the isolated intermediate is consistent with the E4 state. The decay of E4 to E2 + H2 and finally to E0 and 2H2 has confirmed the EPR signal associated with the E2 intermediate.

The above intermediates suggest that the metal cluster is cycled between its original oxidation state and a singly reduced state with additional electrons being stored in hydrides. It has alternatively been proposed that each step involves the formation of a hydride and that the metal cluster actually cycles between the original oxidation state and a singly oxidized state.

=== Distal and alternating pathways for N2 fixation ===

While the mechanism for nitrogen fixation prior to the Janus E4 complex is generally agreed upon, there are currently two hypotheses for the exact pathway in the second half of the mechanism: the &quot;distal&quot; and the &quot;alternating&quot; pathway. In the distal pathway, the terminal nitrogen is hydrogenated first, releases ammonia, then the nitrogen directly bound to the metal is hydrogenated. In the alternating pathway, one hydrogen is added to the terminal nitrogen, then one hydrogen is added to the nitrogen directly bound to the metal. This alternating pattern continues until ammonia is released. Because each pathway favors a unique set of intermediates, attempts to determine which path is correct have generally focused on the isolation of said intermediates, such as the nitrido in the distal pathway, and the diazene and hydrazine in the alternating pathway. Attempts to isolate the intermediates in nitrogenase itself have so far been unsuccessful, but the use of model complexes has allowed for the isolation of intermediates that support both sides depending on the metal center used. Studies with Mo generally point towards a distal pathway, while studies with Fe generally point towards an alternating pathway.

Specific support for the distal pathway has mainly stemmed from the work of Schrock and Chatt, who successfully isolated the nitrido complex using Mo as the metal center in a model complex. Specific support for the alternating pathway stems from a few studies. Iron only model clusters have been shown to catalytically reduce N2. Small tungsten clusters have also been shown to follow an alternating pathway for nitrogen fixation. The vanadium nitrogenase releases hydrazine, an intermediate specific to the alternating mechanism. However, the lack of characterized intermediates in the native enzyme itself means that neither pathway has been definitively proven. Furthermore, computational studies have been found to support both sides, depending on whether the reaction site is assumed to be at Mo (distal) or at Fe (alternating) in the MoFe cofactor.

=== Mechanism of MgATP binding ===
Binding of MgATP is one of the central events to occur in the mechanism employed by nitrogenase. Hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate group of MgATP provides the energy needed to transfer electrons from the Fe protein to the MoFe protein. The binding interactions between the MgATP phosphate groups and the amino acid residues of the Fe protein are well understood by comparing to similar enzymes, while the interactions with the rest of the molecule are more elusive due to the lack of a Fe protein crystal structure with MgATP bound (as of 1996). Three protein residues have been shown to have significant interactions with the phosphates. In the absence of MgATP, a salt bridge exists between residue 15, lysine, and residue 125, aspartic acid. Upon binding, this salt bridge is interrupted. Site-specific mutagenesis has demonstrated that when the lysine is substituted for a glutamine, the protein&#x27;s affinity for MgATP is greatly reduced and when the lysine is substituted for an arginine, MgATP cannot bind due to the salt bridge being too strong. The necessity of specifically aspartic acid at site 125 has been shown through noting altered reactivity upon mutation of this residue to glutamic acid. Residue 16, serine, has been shown to bind MgATP. Site-specific mutagenesis was used to demonstrate this fact. This has led to a model in which the serine remains coordinated to the Mg2+ ion after phosphate hydrolysis in order to facilitate its association with a different phosphate of the now ADP molecule. MgATP binding also induces significant conformational changes within the Fe protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to create mutants in which MgATP binds but does not induce a conformational change. Comparing X-ray scattering data in the mutants versus in the wild-type protein led to the conclusion that the entire protein contracts upon MgATP binding, with a decrease in radius of approximately 2.0 Å.

=== Other mechanistic details ===
Many mechanistic aspects of catalysis remain unknown. No crystallographic analysis has been reported on substrate bound to nitrogenase.

Nitrogenase is able to reduce acetylene, but is inhibited by carbon monoxide, which binds to the enzyme and thereby prevents binding of dinitrogen. Dinitrogen prevent acetylene binding, but acetylene does not inhibit binding of dinitrogen and requires only one electron for reduction to ethylene. Due to the oxidative properties of oxygen, most nitrogenases are irreversibly inhibited by dioxygen, which degradatively oxidizes the Fe-S cofactors. This requires mechanisms for nitrogen fixers to protect nitrogenase from oxygen &quot;in vivo&quot;. Despite this problem, many use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor for respiration. Although the ability of some nitrogen fixers such as Azotobacteraceae to employ an oxygen-labile nitrogenase under aerobic conditions has been attributed to a high metabolic rate, allowing oxygen reduction at the cell membrane, the effectiveness of such a mechanism has been questioned at oxygen concentrations above 70 μM (ambient concentration is 230 μM O2), as well as during additional nutrient limitations. A molecule found in the nitrogen-fixing nodules of leguminous plants, leghemoglobin, which can bind to dioxygen via a heme prosthetic group, plays a crucial role in buffering O2 at the active site of the nitrogenase, while concomitantly allowing for efficient respiration.

==Nonspecific reactions==
In addition to dinitrogen reduction, nitrogenases also reduce protons to dihydrogen, meaning nitrogenase is also a dehydrogenase. A list of other reactions carried out by nitrogenases is shown below:
:HC≡CH → H2C=CH2
:N–=N+=O → N2 + H2O
:N=N=N– → N2 + NH3
: → CH4, NH3, H3C–CH3, H2C=CH2 (CH3NH2)
:N≡C–R → RCH3 + NH3
:C≡N–R → CH4, H3C–CH3, H2C=CH2, C3H8, C3H6, RNH2
:O=C=S → CO + H2S
:O=C=O → CO + H2O 
:S=C=N– → H2S + HCN 
:O=C=N– → H2O + HCN, CO + NH3 

Furthermore, dihydrogen functions as a competitive inhibitor, carbon monoxide functions as a non-competitive inhibitor, and carbon disulfide functions as a rapid-equilibrium inhibitor of nitrogenase.

Vanadium nitrogenases have also been shown to catalyze the conversion of CO into alkanes through a reaction comparable to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

==Organisms that synthesize nitrogenase==

There are two types of bacteria that synthesize nitrogenase and are required for nitrogen fixation. These are:

* Free-living bacteria (non-symbiotic), examples include:
** Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)
** Green sulfur bacteria
** &quot;Azotobacter&quot;
* Mutualistic bacteria (symbiotic), examples include:
** &quot;Rhizobium&quot;, associated with legumes
** &quot;Azospirillum&quot;, associated with grasses
** &quot;Frankia&quot;, associated with actinorhizal plants

==Similarity to other proteins==
The three subunits of nitrogenase exhibit significant sequence similarity to three subunits of the light-independent version of protochlorophyllide reductase that performs the conversion of protochlorophyllide to chlorophyll. This protein is present in gymnosperms, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria but has been lost by angiosperms during evolution.

Separately, two of the nitrogenase subunits (NifD and NifH) have homologues in methanogens that do not fix nitrogen e.g. &quot;Methanocaldococcus jannaschii&quot;. Little is understood about the function of these &quot;class IV&quot; &quot;nif&quot; genes, though they occur in many methanogens. In &quot;M. jannaschii&quot; they are known to interact with each other and are constitutively expressed.

==Measurement of nitrogenase activity ==
As with many assays for enzyme activity, it is possible to estimate nitrogenase activity by measuring the rate of conversion of the substrate (N2) to the product (NH3). Since NH3 is involved in other reactions in the cell, it is often desirable to label the substrate with 15N to provide accounting or &quot;mass balance&quot; of the added substrate. A more common assay, the acetylene reduction assay or ARA, estimates the activity of nitrogenase by taking advantage of the ability of the enzyme to reduce acetylene gas to ethylene gas. These gases are easily quantified using gas chromatography. Though first used in a laboratory setting to measure nitrogenase activity in extracts of &quot;Clostridium pasteurianum&quot; cells, ARA has been applied to a wide range of test systems, including field studies where other techniques are difficult to deploy. For example, ARA was used successfully to demonstrate that bacteria associated with rice roots undergo seasonal and diurnal rhythms in nitrogenase activity, which were apparently controlled by the plant.

Unfortunately, the conversion of data from nitrogenase assays to actual moles of N2 reduced (particularly in the case of ARA), is not always straightforward and may either underestimate or overestimate the true rate for a variety of reasons. For example, H2 competes with N2 but not acetylene for nitrogenase (leading to overestimates of nitrogenase by ARA). Bottle or chamber-based assays may produce negative impacts on microbial systems as a result of containment or disruption of the microenvironment through handling, leading to underestimation of nitrogenase. Despite these weaknesses, such assays are very useful in assessing relative rates or temporal patterns in nitrogenase activity.

<text>The Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle in the Province of Liverpool, known also on occasion as the Northern Province.

==History==

With the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century, Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern. Thus Pope Pius IX issued the Bull &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot; of 29 September 1850 by which thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses were created. The Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern District was duly elevated to diocese status as the Diocese of Hexham.

On 23 May 1861 the diocese became the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle. In the early period from 1850 the diocese was a suffragan of the Metropolitan See of Westminster, but under Pope Pius X, on 28 October 1911, it was assigned to the newly created Province of Liverpool.

==Current situation==

The present diocese covers an area of 7,700 km2 of the counties of Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, Durham and that part of Cleveland which is north of the River Tees. The see is in the City of Newcastle upon Tyne where the seat is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Mary, which was consecrated on 21 August 1860.

The Bishop&#x27;s residence was formerly Bishop&#x27;s House, East Denton Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne. It is now at West Avenue, Gosforth, Newcastle upon Tyne.

The Right Reverend Séamus Cunningham, who was appointed the 13th Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle by Pope Benedict XVI on 9 January 2009. He had previously served as Vicar General and Diocesan Administrator. He was ordained on 20 March 2009, the Feast of Saint Cuthbert, patron of the diocese. He retired at the age of 76 in February 2019.

The previous bishop is the Right Reverend Robert Byrne. He was installed on 25 March 2019 in St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne. Bishop Byrne submitted his resignation early, at the age of 66, citing that his episcopal ministry had become &quot;too great a burden.&quot; His resignation was accepted by the Holy See on 12 December 2022.

==Past and present ordinaries ==

From 1850 to 1861 the title was Bishop of Hexham, and since 1861 it has been Bishop of Hexham and Newcastle.
By the decree of 29 September 1850 by Pope Pius IX, the Roman Catholic hierarchy was restored in England and Wales. Much of the Vicariate Apostolic of the Northern District of England became the Diocese of Hexham, and the Vicar Apostolic of the district became the Bishop of Hexham. The Diocese of Hexham comprised Northumberland, County Durham, Cumberland and Westmorland. The patrons of the diocese were Our Blessed Lady Immaculate and St Cuthbert.

On 22 April 1861, the Propaganda congregation decreed that St Mary&#x27;s Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne should be the bishop&#x27;s seat, and the Episcopal see should be renamed the Diocese of Hexham and Newcastle. The decree was approved by Pope Pius IX on 7 March, and was expedited on 23 May 1861.

<doc id="1080231" wikidata="Q5870401" url="?curid=1080231" title="History of the Scottish National Party">
<text>In Scotland, the Scottish National Party (SNP) is a left social democratic political party which campaigns for Scottish independence. The SNP has controlled Scotland&#x27;s devolved legislature since the 2007 election as a minority government, and were a majority government from the 2011 election and have been a minority government, since the 2016 election.

==Early years (1934–1960)==

The party was founded on 7 April 1934 as the result of a merger between the National Party of Scotland (NPS) and the Scottish Party. Sir Alexander MacEwen became the new party&#x27;s first leader. The merger was the brainchild of leading NPS figure John MacCormick, who desired unity for the nationalist movement in Scotland, and, upon learning of the Scottish Party&#x27;s emergence, moved to secure it.

Initially, the SNP did not support all-out independence for Scotland, but rather the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly within the United Kingdom. This became the party&#x27;s initial position on the constitutional status of Scotland as a result of a compromise between the NPS, who did support independence, and the Scottish Party, who were devolutionists. John MacCormick wanted a merger between the two parties and knew that it would only be through the support of devolution rather than independence that the Scottish Party would be persuaded to merge. However, the SNP quickly reverted to the NPS stance of supporting full independence for Scotland.

Professor Douglas Young was the leader of the Scottish National Party from 1942 to 1945. Young fought for the Scottish people to refuse conscription and his activities were popularly vilified as undermining the British war effort against the Nazis. Young was imprisoned for refusing to be conscripted.

John MacCormick left the party in 1942, owing to his failure to change the party&#x27;s policy from supporting all out independence to Home Rule at that year&#x27;s SNP conference in Glasgow. McCormick went on to form the Scottish Covenant Association, a non-partisan political organisation campaigning for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. This Covenant in itself proved politically challenging for the SNP, as it stole their nationalist platform. It also deprived the party of many members, who left with MacCormick.

The Covenant managed to get over 2 million signatures to a petition demanding Home Rule for Scotland in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and secured support from across the parties, but it eventually faded as a political force.

The SNP&#x27;s early years were characterised by a lack of electoral progress and it wasn&#x27;t until 1945 that the SNP&#x27;s first member was elected to the UK parliament at Westminster. The party&#x27;s first MP was Robert McIntyre who won a by-election for Motherwell under unusual wartime conditions, but he lost the seat in the general election later that year.

McIntyre&#x27;s brief spell did not particularly galvanise the SNP. The 1950s were characterised by low levels of support, and this made it difficult for the party to advance. Indeed, in most general elections they were unable to put up more than a handful of candidates. The party&#x27;s former president, Roland Muirhead, devoted much of his time to the Scottish National Congress, a direct action organisation which competed for support with the SNP.

A split occurred in the SNP in 1955 (although not as large as that of 1942) when a grouping styled the 55 Group started an organised campaign of internal dissent. This group was formed mainly of younger SNP members frustrated at the lack of progress of the party. This split proved to be minor and involved only a few members, mainly located in the city of Edinburgh, and the new National Party of Scotland made no impact whatsoever in the long-run.

==The 1960s==
Despite the poor record the SNP had in the 1950s, by the 1960s, they were beginning to make more impact. They won a significant vote in the 1961 Glasgow Bridgeton by-election, and William Wolfe did well at the 1962 West Lothian by-election. The party began to grow quickly in the 1960s with a rapid growth in the number of recognised branches. For example, in 1966 alone the SNP National Executive recognised 113 new branches of the party. 1967 was the year that the party signalled they could begin to make an impact electorally. The party polled very well at the Pollok by-election, winning some 28% of the votes cast in a constituency where they had never stood before.

Later that year, the SNP scored an even greater electoral success. Winnie Ewing won the Hamilton constituency in a by-election in 1967 with the help of national organizer John McAteer. Consequently, the SNP began to make a serious impact on the political scene. Ewing famously said on the night of her by-election victory, &#x27;stop the world, Scotland wants to get on&#x27;, and this spirit seemed to be embraced by many Scots. Her victory propelled the party into the popular conscience and many new members joined as a result.

A novel feature of the 1967 SNP Annual Conference was that the party leader Arthur Donaldson was challenged for the position of party convenor. His challenger was Douglas Drysdale, who was vocally critical of Donaldson&#x27;s leadership. Donaldson overwhelmingly defeated Drysdale to retain his position. Several prominent individuals formed the 1320 Club, hoping to develop a wider movement in the style of the Scottish Covenant Association, but they were expelled in 1968 for advocating paramilitary activity.

In local elections, the SNP were beginning to show they could compete also. In the 1967 Local Council elections, the SNP secured over 200,000 votes across the country making 27 gains in the burgh elections, and 42 in the counties. They managed to take control of Stirling council where former party leader Robert McIntyre became Provost. The SNP then went onto secure the largest share of the Scottish vote of any of the parties contesting the 1968 Local Council elections, winning some 40% of the vote.

Ewing&#x27;s by-election victory and this improved electoral performance in the local elections helped to provoke the then UK Labour Government to establish the Kilbrandon Commission to set up the blue-print for the establishment of a devolved Scottish Assembly. It also prompted Edward Heath&#x27;s announcement at the Conservative Perth Conference in 1968 that if he became Prime Minister he would establish a Scottish Assembly.

Scotland&#x27;s unionist politicians were becoming increasingly worried at the growth of the SNP. The Labour Party in particular had cause for alarm as Scotland provided so much of their support base, and the SNP were now picking up support in their very heartlands.

At the 1969 party conference, William Wolfe was elected SNP leader in place of Arthur Donaldson.

==The 1970s==

At the 1970 general election, the SNP improved their vote over 1966, but did not make a serious breakthrough. Ewing lost her Hamilton seat and the only consolation for the SNP was the capture of the Western Isles, making Donald Stewart into their only MP. Thereafter, though, the SNP entered a period of sustained growth following the pattern of the 1960s: a number of strong showings in individual by-elections.

There was a minor setback in the early 1970s when a small number of party members in Dundee left to form a Labour Party of Scotland. This new party contested the Dundee East by-election of 1973, and the number of votes they captured was more than the Labour candidate&#x27;s margin of victory over the SNP candidate, Gordon Wilson. However, in the long-run, this new party folded and most of its members returned to the SNP.

They were bolstered by their capture of the Glasgow Govan seat with Margo MacDonald as their candidate from the Labour Party in a by-election in 1973. This again signalled to Labour that the SNP posed an electoral threat to them and in the February 1974 General Election they returned 7 MPs. The failure of the Labour Party to secure an overall majority prompted them to quickly return to the polls to secure such and in the October 1974 General Election the SNP performed even better than they had done earlier in the year, winning 11 MPs and managing to get over 30% of the vote across Scotland.

The main driving force behind the growth of the SNP in the 1970s was the discovery of oil in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland. The SNP ran a hugely successful &quot;It&#x27;s Scotland&#x27;s oil&quot; campaign, emphasising the way in which they believed the discovery of oil could benefit all of Scotland&#x27;s citizens. While Scottish Labour&#x27;s electoral dominance had been well-established at this point, since Labour – as the party that created the National Health Service galvanised support for its vision of the welfare state and working class solidarity across the nations of the UK; the discovery of North Sea oil offered nationalists an equally compelling vision – where oil wealth would provide Scotland an escape from the stagflation the British economy was experiencing and the social unrest it led to.

Former SNP leader William Wolfe has argued that along with this campaign, the SNP was aided by their support for the workers in the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in, being led by Jimmy Reid, as well as supporting the workers at the Scottish Daily Express when they attempted to run the paper themselves and other such campaigns.

===1979 United Kingdom general election===
The SNP continued to ride high in the opinion polls throughout the 1970s, and many members are convinced that if the Liberals, led by David Steel hadn&#x27;t maintained the Labour Government of the time in power, the SNP might have made further electoral gains in the resulting general election. It did well at the local elections of 1977, making 98 net gains and leaving much of Scotland under hung councils. However 1978 saw a Labour revival at the expense of the SNP, at three by-elections (Glasgow Garscadden, Hamilton and Berwick and East Lothian) and the local elections. The general election did not come until 1979, by which time the SNP&#x27;s support had dwindled.

By 1976, the Labour Government had lost the three-seat majority it won at the 1974 general election after a series of by-election defeats, making its survival dependent on SNP support. In a position of the kingmaker, the SNP named home rule for Scotland as its price. Conservative opposition forced progress of the Scottish bill to a crawl, nevertheless, a bill to hold a referendum on establishing a devolved legislative assembly for Scotland was passed in 1978. However, Labour MP George Cunningham inserted an amendment requiring that the proposal be approved by 40% of all registered voters in order to take effect. In practice this doomed the home rule cause as while the proposed Scottish Assembly secured a majority of 51.6% at the referendum, a turnout of 63.7% meant only 32.9% of the electorate approved the bill. As a result, the SNP withdrew its support for the Labour Government.

In 1979, the SNP Parliamentary Group voted against the Labour Government in a Vote of No Confidence, causing the dissolution of the government and subsequent election. The then Labour Prime Minister, James Callaghan famously described this decision by the SNP as that of &quot;turkeys voting for Christmas&quot;. After the 1979 general election, the SNP had only two seats, representing a net loss of nine seats. Margaret Thatcher became the UK&#x27;s Prime Minister.

====UK Government interference====
The party was accused of paranoia when its leaders claimed it was being spied upon by government agents, but this belief was eventually substantiated by declassified government files. These files proved that the government had in fact spied on the SNP in the 1950s. During the 1970s, the British government used both police and agents placed within trade unions to limit the growth of the SNP the best it could. The Labour Party, which controlled the government at the time and drew a great deal of support from Scotland, saw that the SNP had become much more than a protest vote. It is alleged that government interference is part of what helped bring about the collapse in support for the party in 1979. Labour continues to ridicule the SNP for their claims of government interference. &quot;The SNP appears totally paranoid. All the evidence shows they are absolutely no threat whatsoever to the British state,&quot; said a Labour spokesperson in response to the SNP&#x27;s complaints. Despite these words, the Labour government has had several files on the SNP sealed for fifty years, citing reasons of national security.

=== Factionalism after 1979 ===

The party went into a period of decline after the failure to secure a devolved Scottish Assembly in 1979, its poor performance in the general election of that year, and a perceived complicity in helping Thatcher get elected by voting for the dissolution of the Labour government. A period of internal strife followed, culminating in the proscription of two internal groups, Siol nan Gaidheal and the left-wing 79 Group. However, several 79 Group members would later return to prominence in the party, including Alex Salmond, who would later lead the party. It proved too much for Margo MacDonald though, who was defeated by Douglas Henderson for the position of party deputy leader at the 1979 party conference, and left the SNP, angry at the treatment of the left wing of the party, although she would later return to the party and be elected as an MSP.

There was also another internal grouping formed within the party, primarily as a response to the growth of the 79 Group entitled the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland, with the support of traditionalists such as Winnie Ewing. This group sought to ensure that the primary objective of the SNP was campaigning for independence outwith a traditional left-right orientation. If the group was successful, it would have undone the work of figures such as William Wolfe, who moved the SNP to become a clearly defined social democratic party in the 1970s.

==The 1980s==
The period of internal factionalism inside the SNP came to an end at the 1982 SNP Conference, where internal factions were banned. The 79 Group, despite their proscription, were bolstered by the collapse of the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) in the aftermath of the 1979 election. This resulted in the SLP&#x27;s leading figure, Jim Sillars deciding to join the SNP, as did a great number of other ex-SLP members. Sillars had been a Labour Party MP in the 1970s but, dissatisfied with the Labour Government&#x27;s policy on Scottish devolution and their socio-economic programme, had in 1976 formed the SLP. This influx of ex-SLP members served to strengthen the left of the party, to which these new members naturally gravitated.

In 1979, William Wolfe stood down as SNP leader, and in the resultant leadership election Gordon Wilson was elected leader with 530 votes to 79 Group member Stephen Maxwell&#x27;s 117 votes, and Willie McRae&#x27;s 52 votes.

The 1980s offered little hope for the SNP with poor performances in both the 1983 and 1987 General Elections. Indeed, even the party leader, Gordon Wilson lost his seat in 1987. The party took stock of these results and started to analyse its policy platform. Sillars began to grow in influence in the party and the SNP was firmly placing itself on the left of centre.

Sillars argued against the idea that the party should eschew left-right politics in favour of focussing solely on independence by stating the Scottish people had to be given reasons as to why independence would benefit their lives, and that this should involve a fully developed socio-economic programme. He argued against the idea that somehow the country could be guided in a &quot;tartan trance&quot; to independence, as if the Scottish people could ignore the realities of the economic system in which they found themselves. Sillars was also key in moving the party to adopting a position of &quot;Independence in Europe&quot; to alleviate the &quot;separatist&quot; tag that the SNP&#x27;s unionist opponents attached to them. Previously, the SNP had been sceptical about Scotland&#x27;s continued membership of the EEC, but Sillars helped secure a firm commitment to an independent Scotland&#x27;s membership.

There was a minor setback in 1987 when a few members on the left of the party broke away to establish a Scottish Socialist Party (not the same one that is in existence now) but in the long-run this small party did not establish itself and it folded without threatening to make a major electoral breakthrough.

As the 1980s wore on, the party managed to re-group and in 1988 the SNP managed to win the Govan seat in a by-election for the second time, with Sillars as their candidate. This was a huge upset, as the SNP overturned a Labour majority of around 19,000 and had not been expected to win. However, a hard-fought campaign using the party&#x27;s sizeable activist base won through. Sillars&#x27; oratorical capabilities and street campaigning methods also played a decisive role in the party&#x27;s victory.

Sillars&#x27; victory provoked great alarm amongst the Labour Party hierarchy in Scotland, much as Ewing&#x27;s had in the 1960s. Fearing that their strong Scottish electoral base was under threat, they helped establish the Scottish Constitutional Convention to set out a blueprint for devolution. Initially the SNP looked as though they would get involved and party leader Gordon Wilson and Sillars attended an initial meeting of the convention. However, the convention&#x27;s unwillingness to contemplate independence as a constitutional option persuaded Sillars in particular against getting involved and the SNP did not take part.

==The 1990s==

=== The first Salmond era ===
In 1990 Wilson stood down as leader and was replaced by Alex Salmond, who defeated Margaret Ewing for the post by 486 votes to 186. Salmond&#x27;s victory surprised many as Ewing had the backing of most of the party leadership, including Sillars and the party secretary at the time, John Swinney, although he would go on to become a key ally of Salmond. Ewing&#x27;s prominent supporters made her many people&#x27;s favourite to win the contest, but in the end Salmond was the convincing victor. He proved a capable leader with his witty and intelligent style of debate giving him a national prominence and boosting the SNP&#x27;s profile.

In that same year the SNP presence at Westminster was boosted when Labour MP for Dunfermline West, Dick Douglas defected to the SNP, citing his dissatisfaction with the way Labour had handled the Poll Tax issue as one reason. This boosted the SNP numbers at Westminster to five.

The 1992 General Election had promised much for the SNP. It proved to be mixed in fortunes. The SNP held three seats they had won in 1987, but lost Govan. They also lost Dunfermline West, but this was not helped by the sitting MP Dick Douglas deciding to stand against Labour MP Donald Dewar in his Glasgow seat instead of defending the seat he had represented for years.

The SNP had failed to make headway in terms of winning seats. However, their campaign proved a success in terms of votes won, with the SNP vote going up by 50% from their 1987 performance. It proved too much to bear for Sillars though, and he quit active politics, famously describing the Scots as &#x27;90 minute patriots&#x27;. It also signaled the breakdown of the political relationship between Sillars and Salmond.

The intervening years between the 1992 and 1997 general elections were marked by some SNP electoral success. In the 1994 elections for the European Parliament the party managed to secure over 30% of the popular vote and return two MEPs (Winnie Ewing and Allan MacCartney). The SNP also came very close to winning the Monklands East by-election of that year, caused by the death of the leader of the Labour Party, John Smith. In 1995 they went one better, when the Perth and Kinross by-election was won by Roseanna Cunningham who later became the party&#x27;s deputy leader.

The 1997 General Election saw the SNP double their number of MPs from three to six.

===The Scottish Parliament===
The return of the Labour Party to power came along with a referendum on Scottish devolution, which resulted in the establishment of the Scottish Parliament. This gave the SNP an opportunity to firmly establish itself as a political force in Scotland, and it returned 35 MSPs in the first Scottish Parliament election in 1999. Later that year, the party returned two members to the European Parliament, narrowly missing out on sending a third.

==The 2000s==

===Swinney era===
In 2000 John Swinney MSP was elected leader, defeating Alex Neil MSP by 547 votes to 268 in a hotly contested leadership election to replace Alex Salmond as National Convenor. Swinney&#x27;s leadership quickly came under challenge. His subdued style of debating technique was often contrasted with that of his more charismatic predecessor.

The first term of the Scottish Parliament did not offer the SNP much comfort. Two MSPs quit the party, Margo MacDonald and Dorothy-Grace Elder, citing the actions of some of their colleagues as reasons for their resignations. The SNP also performed poorly at the 2001 UK general election with a reduced share of the vote and one fewer MP.

Despite optimism that the party would at least retain the same number of MSPs they gained in 1999, a downturn in electoral fortune at the 2003 Scottish Parliament Elections weakened them somewhat. They returned 27 elected members in the Scottish Parliament, though remained the second largest party. The only parties which increased their representation in that election were the Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) and the Scottish Green Party, both of which also support independence.

Soon, Swinney&#x27;s leadership was challenged by grassroots activist, Dr. Bill Wilson, in the summer of 2003. Wilson was broadly critical of what he argued were the centralising tendencies of the Swinney leadership, as well as a drift to the centre ground of politics away from the SNP&#x27;s traditional position of the left. At the party conference of that year, the election took place with Swinney receiving 577 votes and Wilson taking 111.

2004 did not get off to a good start for Swinney&#x27;s leadership. On 1 January, a former parliamentary candidate and a party activist in the Shetland Islands Brian Nugent announced that he was forming his own pro-independence party, the &quot;Scottish Party&quot; (which eventually relaunched itself as the Free Scotland Party) in response to what he perceived to be an overly pro-EU stance by the SNP.

Soon afterwards, the party&#x27;s National Executive Committee decided to suspend and then expel Campbell Martin, an SNP MSP. Martin had backed Wilson&#x27;s leadership challenge and had continued to be overtly critical of Swinney&#x27;s leadership, resulting in disciplinary action.

Despite a slump in the vote and a decrease in the number of available seats from 7 to 6, the SNP was able to retain its two Members of the European Parliament at the 2004 European elections. Nonetheless, John Swinney announced his resignation on 22 June 2004. He said that he would remain as caretaker leader until a successor was elected.

===2004 leadership contest===
Shortly afterwards, two MSPs (Roseanna Cunningham and Nicola Sturgeon) and one former MSP (Mike Russell) announced that they would be candidates in the election for the party leadership. Alex Neil MSP announced that he would not be a candidate, citing what he believed to be the hostility of senior party figures such as Fergus Ewing and Alex Salmond to the prospect of his becoming leader. In a surprise announcement on 15 July 2004, Alex Salmond announced that he would also be a candidate in the leadership race, despite having previously said &quot;if asked, I&#x27;ll decline, if nominated, I&#x27;ll defer, and if elected, I&#x27;ll resign&quot;. Nicola Sturgeon then withdrew from the contest and declared her support for Salmond and decided to stand for Deputy Leader.

This resulted in Kenny MacAskill pulling out of the race for deputy and declaring his support for Salmond and Sturgeon, leaving Sturgeon standing against Fergus Ewing and Christine Grahame. Shortly after Salmond and Sturgeon announced they were running on a joint ticket.

The campaign for leader was characterised by being a low-key affair. Salmond remained firm favourite to win back the leadership of the SNP. There remained greater doubt as to who would be the deputy leader with it being widely expected to be a much more close run affair than that for the post of leader.

There were some surprises during the course of the campaign. Alex Neil and Adam Ingram both came out in support of Alex Salmond, although they supported Grahame for deputy rather than Sturgeon. This was unexpected as both men had previously been critics of Salmond in the past. It was particularly surprising in light of Salmond&#x27;s earlier comments, before he had entered the race that he would have difficulties working with Neil should he be elected leader, although he later went on the record to say that he should not have publicly said this.

There was some degree of criticism of Salmond&#x27;s position by other candidates, who felt that his decision to lead the SNP from being a member of the British Parliament at Westminster rather than from the Scottish Parliament was contrary to the party&#x27;s aim of independence. Nonetheless, on 3 September 2004, Salmond and Sturgeon were elected leader and deputy respectively. The result of the Leadership contest, in what was the first &quot;One Member One Vote&quot; election run by the SNP (as opposed to the delegate based elections of the past) was Salmond 4,952 (75.8%); Cunningham 953 (14.6%); and Russell 631 (9.7%). The result of the contest for Deputy Leader was Sturgeon 3,521 (53.9%); Ewing 1,605 (24.6%); and Grahame 1,410 (21.6%).

Since Salmond was an MP until 2010, Sturgeon led the party at the Scottish Parliament until Alex Salmond was elected as an MSP in 2007.

===2005 United Kingdom general election===

The SNP had mixed fortunes in the general election held on 5 May 2005. They managed to gain two seats (Angus MacNeil winning in Na h-Eileanan an Iar and Stewart Hosie in Dundee East) from the notional four they held to bring their total to six Members of Parliament. MacNeil&#x27;s victory received particular praise for the 9.2% swing from Labour that led to the victory, especially as it was the first SNP gain from Labour in a UK general election for 31 years. However, there was also disappointment in that the sitting MP Annabelle Ewing did not manage to win the new Ochil and South Perthshire constituency, finishing 688 votes behind the Labour candidate.

There was also disappointment in that the SNP&#x27;s share of the Scottish vote fell to 17.7% and that they finished third behind the Liberal-Democrats; this was the first time this had ever happened. The SNP&#x27;s share of the vote across the Scottish Central Belt was particularly low, with some candidates only just managing to achieve a high enough share of the vote in their constituency to retain their £500 deposit.

However, Alex Salmond was in buoyant mood in the aftermath of the campaign, describing the SNP&#x27;s Westminster parliamentary group as &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Super Six&quot; and also promising that the SNP would be far more competitive in the 2007 election for the Scottish Parliament.

=== The second Salmond era ===
The return of Salmond marked an important milestone in the SNP&#x27;s ideological transformation. Already during his first stint as leader, Salmond had convinced the party to embrace gradualism and adopt &quot;independence must be achieved by a referendum&quot; as the new strategy – an end to the long-held nationalist suspicion of referendums as a tool for unionists to thwart the independence cause, as had been the case in the 1979 devolution referendum. With a strategy that would later be adopted by Conservative leader David Cameron, Salmond decided the only way to end New Labour&#x27;s electoral dominance was to emulate it, while highlighting their few ideological differences where New Labour was less popular, such as its support for the Trident nuclear deterrent based in Scotland. Like New Labour, the SNP embraced neo-liberal economics and sought to follow the Irish model by slashing corporation tax and attracting international businesses, while ending its traditional radicalism by abandoning its plans for nationalisation and higher income taxes. Unlike New Labour, however, Salmond and his deputy Nicola Sturgeon coated their policies with a heavy douse of social democratic rhetoric in order to appear more authentically left-wing than Labour to the latter&#x27;s supporters.

===2007 Scottish Parliament general election===
The Scottish National Party was victorious in the 2007 election to the Scottish Parliament, emerging as the largest party with 47 seats. It narrowly defeated the incumbent Scottish Labour Party, which had 46 seats. The Conservatives won 17 seats, the Lib Dems 16 seats, the Greens 2 seats, and the Independent candidate Margo MacDonald was re-elected. On 16 May 2007, Alex Salmond was elected First Minister by the Parliament and sworn in the next day at the Court of Session in Edinburgh. The SNP went on to win the 2008 Glasgow East by-election and the largest share of the Scottish popular vote in the 2009 European Parliament election. The SNP exploited voter fatigue with Labour – a 2006 poll found 56% Scots believed Labour had been in power in Scotland for too longer, the fallout from the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the power struggle between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown which eroded Labour&#x27;s popularity. Devolution had clearly become a turning point in the SNP&#x27;s electoral fortunes, as while it would struggle for relevance in a UK election, the devolved parliament provided the SNP with oxygen it otherwise could not compete with Labour. As all of the SNP&#x27;s MPs made the switch to the Scottish Parliament while only a handful of Labour MPs followed suit, the clear contrast in commitment to Scotland further the SNP&#x27;s narrative that it, not Labour, was fighting for Scotland&#x27;s interests. Salmond became the first pro-independence Scottish leader since the Act of Union of 1707.

==The 2010s==

The 2010 UK general election proved disappointing for the SNP, as the party only retained their six seats without making any gains, although they did overtake the Liberal Democrats to become the second-largest party on the popular vote share.
=== Majority government in Holyrood ===

The 2011 Scottish Parliament election, however, delivered the first majority government of the devolved Scottish Parliament as the SNP won a landslide of 69 seats, considered a remarkable feat as the Additional Member System used to elect MSPs was originally implemented to prevent single-party governments, as well as to produce proportional results. Following the result, the leaders of all the main opposition parties resigned their positions. The SNP&#x27;s victory came on the back of the collapse of the Lib Dems, who was tainted by its participation in the Conservative-led UK Government, while Scottish Labour had clearly failed to inspire voters in opposition. Later, the SNP confirmed its intent to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.

===Independence referendum campaign===


In October 2012, the SNP voted at its party conference to change their stance on NATO, supporting continued membership for an independent Scotland. This was widely seen as the resolution of the long-standing NATO debate within the party. In response, two MSPs – John Finnie and Jean Urquhart – resigned from the party and became Independent MSPs. Another MSP, John Wilson, followed after the independence referendum.

In November 2013, some policies the SNP would pursue in an independent Scotland were detailed in &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Future&quot;, the Scottish Government&#x27;s 670-page white paper on the case for Scottish independence and the means through which Scotland would become an independent country. It had previously been claimed by the SNP that the White Paper would be a &quot;game changer&quot; and support for independence did rise after the publication of the document.

The referendum was held on Thursday 18 September 2014. The Yes Campaign was defeated, with 44.7% of voters voting &quot;Yes&quot; and 55.3% voting &quot;No&quot; in response to the question &quot;Should Scotland be an independent country?&quot;. The turnout was 84.6%.

===Sturgeon era===

Following the defeat of the Yes Campaign, on the morning of 19 September, Alex Salmond announced he intended to step down as Leader of the Scottish National Party and First Minister of Scotland at the SNP&#x27;s Autumn Conference.

On 14 November 2014, Nicola Sturgeon was elected as Leader of the Scottish National Party unopposed, with Dundee East MP Stewart Hosie elected as Depute Leader. On 20 November 2014, Sturgeon was formally sworn in as First Minister of Scotland, becoming the first female to hold the position. She embarked on a tour of Scotland, speaking to 12,000 people at the Hydro Arena in Glasgow on 22 November 2014.

The SNP&#x27;s party membership increased dramatically post referendum, from around 25,000 members on the day of the referendum to around 92,000 as of 22 November 2014.

===2015 SNP landslide===
The SNP rebounded from the loss in the independence referendum at the 2015 UK general election, led by Nicola Sturgeon. The party went from holding six seats in the House of Commons to 56, mostly at the expense of the Labour Party. All but three of the fifty-nine constituencies in the country elected an SNP candidate in the party&#x27;s most comprehensive electoral victory at any level; the party became the third-largest in the Commons, overtaking the Liberal Democrats (UK) — the Lib Dems or Liberals had been the third party since the Second World War.

===2016 parliamentary elections===

The SNP remained in control of the Scottish Parliament following the 2016 parliamentary elections. However, the SNP dropped from 69 seats at the 2011 election to 63, losing their majority. Nicola Sturgeon retained her post as First Minister under an SNP minority government.

=== 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum ===


The SNP was the only party to oppose the parliamentary bill which authorised a referendum on the UK&#x27;s membership of the EU a year prior. While the SNP campaigned against European Communities membership in the 1975 referendum, it campaigned for Remain alongside Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and Plaid Cymru, while the Remain campaign was also supported by the UK Government and Prime Minister David Cameron, despite the Conservative Party remaining officially neutral. The UK Independence Party was the only main party in Great Britain to campaign for Leave. The UK as a whole voted for Leave by 52% on the back of English support, with England voting for Leave by 53%, while Scotland voted overwhelmingly for Remain by 62%, alongside Northern Ireland and Greater London. In its manifesto for the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, launched in April, two months before the EU referendum, the SNP stated that &quot;a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will&quot; would justify another independence referendum. Scotland&#x27;s desire to remain in the EU and the direction taken by Conservative governments since the referendum have driven the SNP campaign for another independence referendum.

=== 2017 United Kingdom general election ===
The SNP underperformed against polling expectations, losing 21 seats to bring their Westminster MPs down to 35. In what was largely attributed to their stance on holding a second Scottish independence referendum and saw a significant swing to the Unionist parties, with seats being gained by the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats and a significant reduction in their majorities in the seats they did manage to retain. High-profile losses included: SNP House of Commons leader Angus Robertson in Moray and former SNP leader and First Minister Alex Salmond in Gordon; both of whom lost their seats to the Conservative Party.
===2019 United Kingdom general election===
The party achieved its best ever European Parliament result in the final election before Brexit, with the party taking its MEP total to 3 or half of Scottish seats. Later that year the SNP experienced a surge in the 2019 general election, winning 45.0% of the vote in Scotland. Although the party suffered a loss to the Liberal Democrats, it gained the seat of its then UK leader Jo Swinson, along with 7 from the Conservatives and 6 from Labour. Overall the party finished with 48 out of 59, or 81% of Scotland&#x27;s Westminster seats.
==The 2020s==
===2021 Scottish Parliament Election===
At the 2021 Scottish election, the SNP won 64 seats, one seat short of a majority, albeit achieving a record high number of votes, vote share and constituency seats, and leading to another minority government led by the SNP. Sturgeon emphasised after her party&#x27;s victory that it would focus on controlling the COVID-19 pandemic as well as pushing for a second referendum on independence.

Although in 2021 they won with a minority, a majority of MSPs elected had come from parties that supported Scottish independence; this prompted negotiations between the SNP and the Scottish Green Party to secure a deal that would see Green ministers appointed to government and the Scottish Greens backing SNP policies, with hopes that this united front on independence would solidify the SNP&#x27;s mandate for the second independence referendum. The Third Sturgeon government was formed with Green support.

In the 2022 Scottish local elections, the SNP remained as the biggest party, winning a record number of councillors and securing majority control of Dundee.

On 15 February 2023, Sturgeon announced her intention to resign as leader and first minister.

On 16 March 2023, it was revealed that the SNP&#x27;s membership had fallen to 72,000, down from over 125,000 at the end of 2019. As a result of this, CEO Peter Murrell resigned on 18 March after criticism was levied at him over the way the figures were published.
=== Post Sturgeon era (2023 onwards) ===

Humza Yousaf was announced as the next leader of the SNP on 27 March 2023 after winning the leadership election. Yousaf defeated Kate Forbes in the final stage, with 52% of the vote to Forbes&#x27;s 48%. The leadership election was dominated by the strategy for a second independence referendum and the Gender Recognition Reform Bill, which has divided the party. Yousaf&#x27;s views align with the party establishment and he is expected to continue Sturgeon&#x27;s policies. The other two candidates, Forbes and Regan, were seen to be part of a new generational shift in the party.

On 5 April 2023, Peter Murrell, husband of Nicola Sturgeon and former party CEO, was arrested in connection with an investigation into Scottish National Party finances. It was reported that Police Scotland were searching a number of addresses including SNP headquarters and his home in Glasgow. A Niesmann + Bischoff motorhome was subsequently seized from a home in Fife that is believed to belong to Murrell&#x27;s mother. He was later released without charge, pending further investigation. On 7 April 2023 it was announced that the SNP&#x27;s auditors, Johnston Carmichael, had resigned from their role around October 2022, leaving only three months for their successors to approve and submit to the Electoral Commission the party&#x27;s annual accounts for 2022. However, Humza Yousaf claimed he was unaware of the resignation until he won the SNP leadership contest in late March 2023. This comes less than a year after Douglas Chapman, SNP MP, resigned as their national treasurer stating that he was not given sufficient information to discharge his role.

In October 2023, Ash Regan defected to the breakaway Alba Party after being a candidate in the previous leadership election against Yousaf and Forbes. In April 2024, a government crisis lead to the resignation of Humza Yousaf as first minister of Scotland. John Swinney returned as SNP leader after being elected unopposed in the 2024 Scottish National Party leadership election. In the July 2024 United Kingdom general election in Scotland, the SNP faced catastrophic losses in terms of seats falling from 48 seats to just 9. They were wiped out of the Central Belt, and their seats were now concentrated in North East Scotland and the Scottish Highlands. In October 2024, former SNP leader Alex Salmond died suddenly in North Macedonia.

<text>The Bishop of Arundel and Brighton is the ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Arundel and Brighton in the Province of Southwark, England.
On 21 May 2015, Pope Francis appointed Richard Moth to be the fifth bishop of Arundel and Brighton. He was installed on 28 May 2015 at Arundel Cathedral. The most recent former bishop was the Right Reverend Kieran Thomas Conry, the fourth bishop of the diocese, who announced his resignation on 27 September 2014, and which was accepted by Pope Francis on 4 October 2014. 

The Diocese of Arundel and Brighton was created on 28 May 1965 out of the Diocese of Southwark when the latter was elevated to archdiocese status.

The diocese covers and consists of the counties of East and West Sussex and Surrey outside the Greater London Boroughs. The see is in the town of Arundel where the bishop&#x27;s seat is located in the Cathedral Church of Our Lady &amp; Saint Philip Howard.

<doc id="1080236" wikidata="Q1164991" url="?curid=1080236" title="Dyeing">
<text>Dyeing is the application of dyes or pigments on textile materials such as fibers, yarns, and fabrics with the goal of achieving color with desired color fastness. Dyeing is normally done in a special solution containing dyes and particular chemical material. Dye molecules are fixed to the fiber by absorption, diffusion, or bonding with temperature and time being key controlling factors. The bond between the dye molecule and fiber may be strong or weak, depending on the dye used. Dyeing and printing are different applications; in printing, color is applied to a localized area with desired patterns. In dyeing, it is applied to the entire textile.

The primary source of dye, historically, has been nature, with the dyes being extracted from plants or animals. Since the mid-19th century, however, humans have produced artificial dyes to achieve a broader range of colors and to render the dyes more stable for washing and general use. Different classes of dyes are used for different types of fiber and at different stages of the textile production process, from loose fibers through yarn and cloth to complete garments.

Acrylic fibers are dyed with basic dyes, while nylon and protein fibers such as wool and silk are dyed with acid dyes, and polyester yarn is dyed with dispersed dyes. Cotton is dyed with a range of dye types, including vat dyes, and modern synthetic reactive and direct dyes.

==Etymology==
The word &#x27;dye&#x27; (, ) comes from the Middle English , and from the Old English and . The first known use of the word &#x27;dye&#x27; was before the 12th century.

==History==


The earliest dyed flax fibers have been found in a prehistoric cave in Georgia and dates back to 34,000 BC.
More evidence of textile dyeing dates back to the Neolithic period at the large Neolithic settlement at Çatalhöyük in southern Anatolia, where traces of red dyes, possibly from ocher, an iron oxide pigment derived from clay, were found. In China, dyeing with plants, barks, and insects has been traced back more than 5,000 years. Early evidence of dyeing comes from Sindh province in Ancient India modern day Pakistan, where a piece of cotton dyed with a vegetable dye was recovered from the archaeological site at Mohenjo-daro (3rd millennium BCE). The dye used in this case was madder, which, along with other dyes such as indigo, was introduced to other regions through trade. Natural insect dyes such as Cochineal and kermes and plant-based dyes such as woad, indigo and madder were important elements of the economies of Asia and Europe until the discovery of man-made synthetic dyes in the mid-19th century. The first synthetic dye was William Perkin&#x27;s mauveine in 1856, derived from coal tar. Alizarin, the red dye present in madder, was the first natural pigment to be duplicated synthetically in 1869, a development which led to the collapse of the market for naturally grown madder. The development of new, strongly colored synthetic dyes followed quickly, and by the 1870s commercial dyeing with natural dyestuffs was disappearing. An important characteristic was light-fastness - resistance to fading when exposed to sunlight using industrial techniques such as those developed by James Morton.

==Methods==
Dyeing can be applied at various stages within the textile manufacturing process; for example, fibers may be dyed before being spun into yarns, and yarns may be dyed before being woven into fabrics. Fabrics and sometimes finished garments themselves may also be dyed. The stage at which a product is dyed varies depending on its intended end use, the cost to the manufacturer, its desired appearance, and the resources available, amongst other reasons. There are specific terms to describe these dyeing methods, such as:
* Dope dyeing: In dope dyeing, pigments are added to the polymer solution itself before extruding the fibers. The process provides the dyed fibers with excellent fastness properties. The dope dyeing applies to synthetic fiber only. This method of dyeing is also known as solution dyeing and &#x27;mass coloration&#x27; or &#x27;mass colored&#x27;. It has limited color options.
* Fiber dyeing: In fiber dyeing, the dyeing takes place at the fiber stage before they are spun into yarn. It is also called stock dyeing. Examples are melanges and medleys.
* Yarn dyeing: In yarn dyeing, the yarns are dyed first before the fabric manufacturing stage. The yarn dyeing happens in hanks or in package dyeing. Package dyeing is a method where yarns are wound on perforated cones placed in a dye vessel. The dye solution is then alternatively pushed inside out and vice versa. Examples are many stripes, patterned (checks) and jacquard designed fabrics.
* Piece dyeing: In piece dyeing, the dyeing takes place after producing fabrics with undyed yarns. Most of the solid dyed fabrics are dyed with the piece dyeing method, and the materials are also called piece dyed.
* Garment dyeing: In garment dyeing, the garments are constructed of undyed, but ready-for-dyeing, fabrics.

=== Terms for different dyed materials ===
There are various terms used in the manufacturing and marketing industries depending on the method used to dye the substrate. For example, &quot;stock dyed&quot; refers to dyeing the fibers before making the yarn, &quot;yarn dyed&quot; refers to dyeing the yarns before producing fabrics, and &quot;piece dyed&quot; or &quot;fabric dyed&quot; refers to dyeing the yarns after they are converted into fabric. The fastness of fiber- and yarn-dyed materials is superior to that of fabrics.

=== Objective ===
The primary objective of the dyeing process is to achieve uniform color application in accordance with a predetermined color matching standard or reference on the substrate, which may be a fiber, yarn, or fabric, while meeting specified colour fastness requirements. Tie-dye and printing are the methods where the color is applied in a localized manner.

=== Application ===
==== Exhaust method ====
In the exhaust method, the dye is transported to the substrate by the dye liquor&#x27;s motion. The dye is adsorbed onto the fibre surface and ideally diffuses into the whole of the fibre. Water consumption in exhaust application is higher than the continuous dyeing method. There are three corresponding ways of dyeing with the exhaust method.

# Liquor circulating: loose stock, sliver, tow, yarn or fabric, is packed into canisters, wound onto cones or perforated beams and placed inside the dyeing vessel. In this way the liquor is pumped and revolves through the material which is stationary.
# Material circulating: Fabric winch dyeing and jiggers are the few forms in which material remains in motion and liquor stationary. In this the material moves through the stationary liquor.
# Liquor and material both in motion: Jet dyeing and softflow dyeing application methods where material and liquor both remain in motion.

==== Continuous method ====
In continuous method dye is transported to the substrate by passing it through the different stages but continuously. The continuous method is an innovative method where many discrete dyeing stages are combined, such as applying color, fixation and, washing off of unfixed dyes. Types of continuous dyeing are as follows

* Pad-steam
* Pad dry
* Thermosol
Cold pad batch method is a semi-continuous dyeing process.

==== Waterless dyeing method ====
Waterless dyeing, also known as dry dyeing, is the newly developed and more sustainable dyeing method in which the dyes are applied to the substrate with the help of carbon dioxide or solutions that need less or no water compared to their counterparts.

=== Selection of dyes===
The selection of the appropriate dyes is most important because any given dye does not apply to every type of fiber. Dyes are classified according to many parameters, such as chemical structure, affinity, application method, desired colour fastness i.e. resistance to washing, rubbing, and light. The properties may vary with different dyes. The selection of dye depends on the objective in dyeing and affinity (to which material is to be dyed). Fastness of color largely depends upon the molecular size of the dyes and the solubility. Larger molecular size serves better washing fastness results.

Indigo dyes have a poor wash and rubbing fastness on denim (cotton), so they are used to produce washed-down effects on fabrics. In contrast, vat or reactive dyes are applied to cotton to achieve excellent washing fastness.

The next important criterion for selecting dyes is the assessment of hazards to human health and the environment. There are many dyes especially disperse dyes that may cause allergic reactions to some individuals, and the negative impact on the environment. There are national and international standards and regulations which need to comply.

===Direct application===

The term &quot;direct dye application&quot; stems from some dyestuff having to be either fermented as in the case of some natural dye or chemically reduced as in the case of synthetic vat and sulfur dyes before being applied. This renders the dye soluble so that it can be absorbed by the fiber since the insoluble dye has very little substantivity to the fiber. Direct dyes, a class of dyes largely for dyeing cotton, are water-soluble and can be applied directly to the fiber from an aqueous solution. Most other classes of synthetic dye, other than vat and surface dyes, are also applied in this way.

The term may also be applied to dyeing without the use of mordants to fix the dye once it is applied. Mordants were often required to alter the hue and intensity of natural dyes and improve color fastness. Chromium salts were until recently extensively used in dyeing wool with synthetic mordant dyes. These were used for economical high color fastness dark shades such as black and navy. Environmental concerns have now restricted their use, and they have been replaced with reactive and metal complex dyes that do not require mordant.

===Yarn dyeing===

There are many forms of yarn dyeing. Common forms are the package form and the hanks form. Cotton yarns are mostly dyed at package form, and acrylic or wool yarn are dyed at hank form. In the continuous filament industry, polyester or polyamide yarns are always dyed at package form, while viscose rayon yarns are partly dyed at hank form because of technology.

The common dyeing process of cotton yarn with reactive dyes at package form is as follows: 
# The raw yarn is wound on a spring tube to achieve a package suitable for dye penetration.
# These softened packages are loaded on a dyeing carrier&#x27;s spindle one on another.
# The packages are pressed up to a desired height to achieve suitable density of packing.
# The carrier is loaded on the dyeing machine and the yarn is dyed.
# After dyeing, the packages are unloaded from the carrier into a trolley.
# Now the trolley is taken to hydro extractor where water is removed.
# The packages are hydro extracted to remove the maximum amount of water leaving the desired color into raw yarn.
# The packages are then dried to achieve the final dyed package.

After this process, the dyed yarn packages are packed and delivered.

==== Space dyeing====

Space dyeing is a technique of localized color application that produces a unique multicolored effect.

=== History of garment dyeing ===
Garment dyeing is the process of dyeing fully fashioned garments subsequent to manufacturing, as opposed to the conventional method of manufacturing garments from pre-dyed fabrics.

Up until the mid-1970s the method was rarely used for commercial clothing production. It was used domestically, to overdye old, worn and faded clothes, and also by resellers of used or surplus military clothing. The first notable industrial use of the technique was made by Benetton, which garment dyed its Shetland wool knitwear.

=== Complex garment dyeing ===
In the mid-1970s the Bologna clothing designer Massimo Osti began experimenting with the garment dyeing technique. His experimentation over the next decade, led to the pioneering of not just the industrial use of traditional garment dyeing (dyeing simple cotton or wool garments) but, more importantly, the technique of “complex garment dyeing” which involved dyeing fully fashioned garments which had been constructed from multiple fabric or fiber types (e.g. a jacket made from both nylon and cotton, or linen, nylon and polyurethane coated cotton) in the same bath.

Up until its development by Osti (for his clothing brand C.P. Company), this technique had never been successfully industrially applied in any context. The complexity lay in developing both a practical and chemical understanding of how each fabric responded differently to the dye, how much it would shrink, how much color it would absorb, developing entirely new forms of quality control to verify possible defects in fabric before dyeing etc.

Beyond the industrial advantages of the technique (purchasing fabric in one color, white or natural, you may produce as many colors as you wish etc.), the artistic advantages of the technique were considerable and in many ways paved the way for the creation of the clothing style today known as Italian Sportswear. These advantages included
* the way in which different fibers absorbed the dye&#x27;s color allowed for the creation of incredibly nuanced differences in color tones and a harmony that is impossible to achieve any other way
* the garment dyeing process naturally gave the fabric a “worn-in” hand allowing for the development of the casual and relaxed version of the classic menswear look which characterizes Italian sportswear
* the fact that each fabric and fiber type responds differently to the dye also produces a “deconstructed” effect, whereby the consumer&#x27;s attention is drawn to the construction techniques of the jacket. For example: a more densely woven fabric absorbs the color less intensely than a more open weave, the polyester stitching used for a cotton garment does not absorb any dye color, producing a contrast color stitch etc.
The disadvantages included: 
* a relatively high failure rate for garments (between 5–10%)
* the difficulty in achieving a very tailored look due to difficulties in precisely calculating shrinkage rates
* high research and prototyping costs in order to understand how fabrics will behave in production
Today, whilst garment dyeing is a diffusely employed as an industrial technique around the globe, predominantly in the production of vintage style cotton garments and by fast fashion suppliers, complex garment dyeing is still practiced almost exclusively in Italy, by a handful of premium brands and suppliers who remain committed to the art.

== Related terms ==
There are several terms associated with the process of dyeing:

=== Affinity ===
Affinity refers to the chemical attraction between two elements or substances, leading to their inclination to unite or combine, as observed between fiber and dyestuff.

=== Bleeding ===
Materials that exhibit bleeding tendencies may lead to the staining of white or light-colored fabrics in contact with them while in a wet state. The phenomenon of color fading from a fabric or yarn upon immersion in water, solvent, or a comparable liquid medium, arises due to inadequate dyeing or the utilization of inferior quality dyes.

==== Staining ====
Fabric can experience undesired color absorption, resulting in staining, when exposed to water, dry-cleaning solvent, or similar liquids containing unintended dyestuffs or coloring materials. Additionally, direct contact with other dyed materials may cause color transfer through bleeding or sublimation.

=== Stripping ===
Stripping is a method used to partially or entirely remove color from dyed textile materials. It can also be utilized as a reprocessing technique to correct imperfect dyeing.

<text>The Archbishop of Birmingham heads the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham in England. As such he is the metropolitan archbishop of the Province of Birmingham. The archdiocese covers an area of and spans of the counties of Oxfordshire, Staffordshire, West Midlands, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. The see in the City of Birmingham where the archbishop&#x27;s seat is located at the Metropolitan Cathedral and Basilica of Saint Chad.

With the gradual abolition of the legal restrictions on the activities of Catholics in England and Wales in the early 19th century, Rome decided to proceed to bridge the gap of the centuries from Queen Elizabeth I by instituting Catholic dioceses on the regular historical pattern. Thus Pope Pius IX issued the Bull &quot;Universalis Ecclesiae&quot; of 29 September 1850 by which thirteen new dioceses which did not formally claim any continuity with the pre-Elizabethan English dioceses were created. One of these was the diocese of Birmingham. This has its origins in the Vicariates Apostolic of England, of the Midland District and lastly of the Central District. The last Vicar Apostolic of the Central District, from 28 July 1848, was Bishop William Bernard Ullathorne, O.S.B., who on 29 September 1850 became the first bishop of Birmingham.

In the early period from 1850 the diocese was a suffragan of the Metropolitan See of Westminster, but a further development was the creation under Pope Pius X, on 28 October 1911, of a new Province of Birmingham.

The current archbishop is The Most Reverend Bernard Longley, who was appointed the ninth archbishop of Birmingham on 1 October 2009 and installed at the Metropolitan Cathedral and Basilica of Saint Chad on 8 December 2009, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception and one of the patronal feasts of the archdiocese, St Chad being the other.

<doc id="1080249" wikidata="Q665454" url="?curid=1080249" title="Ceremony (The Cult album)">
<text>Ceremony is the fifth studio album by British rock band The Cult, first released on 23 September 1991. The most popular songs on the album are “Wild Hearted Son” and “Heart of Soul”.

== Album information ==
&quot;Ceremony&quot; represented a period of great turmoil within the band. Longtime bassist Jamie Stewart had departed prior to recording, and the working relationship between vocalist Ian Astbury and guitarist Billy Duffy was at an all-time low. The pair reportedly rarely agreed to appear at the studio together, opting to record their parts separately at different times.

The album was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band&#x27;s previous worldwide successes with their 1987 album &quot;Electric&quot; and its 1989 follow-up &quot;Sonic Temple&quot;. It was heavily inspired by Native American culture.

The band was sued for $61,000,000 by the parents of the Native American boy pictured on the album cover.

In New York, the case against Warner Bros. Records was dismissed in February 1997 for lack of personal jurisdiction. A separate case was filed in the District Court of South Dakota on April 10, 1995, but was terminated on May 16, 1995.

The album reached #25 in the U.S. and reached #9 in Canada, and achieved platinum status, but sales suffered with the arrival of grunge rock and time spent dealing with the lawsuit. Some countries, including South Korea and Thailand, did not see the record&#x27;s release until 1992 and it was unreleased in Turkey until the Cult played several shows in Istanbul in June 1993. It reached #16 on the US Cashbox charts.

== Track listing ==
All tracks written by Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy.
# &quot;Ceremony&quot; – 6:27
# &quot;Wild Hearted Son&quot; – 5:41
# &quot;Earth Mofo&quot; – 4:42
# &quot;White&quot; – 7:56

# &quot;Indian&quot; – 4:53
# &quot;Sweet Salvation&quot; – 5:25
# &quot;Wonderland&quot; – 6:10

== Track information ==
Both &quot;Ceremony&quot; and &quot;Wild Hearted Son&quot; begin with Native American Indian dances. &quot;White&quot; includes an excerpt from Lawrence Lipton&#x27;s 1959 book &#x27;The Holy Barbarians&#x27;, which was later the name of Astbury&#x27;s band, formed in 1996. &quot;Heart of Soul&quot; begins with the lyric &quot;Down and out in London, Los Angeles, and Paris too&quot;, which is a reference to George Orwell&#x27;s &#x27;Down and Out in Paris and London&#x27;, with Los Angeles being where the band were based at that time.

&quot;Wild Hearted Son&quot; (UK#40, Canada #41) was the first officially released single, followed by &quot;Heart of Soul&quot; (UK#51). &quot;Sweet Salvation&quot; and &quot;Heart of Soul&quot; were both released as promotional only singles in Argentina in 1992, and &quot;Ceremony&quot; was released as a promotional single in Spain.

== History ==

Çukurova University was officially established in 1973 through the merger of the Faculty of Agriculture, founded in 1969 by Ankara University, and the Faculty of Medicine, founded in 1972 by Atatürk University. Initially comprising these two faculties, the university expanded to five faculties with the establishment of the Faculties of Basic Sciences, Administrative Sciences, and Engineering. In 1982, the Faculty of Basic Sciences was reorganized as the Faculty of Sciences and Letters, while the Faculty of Administrative Sciences merged with the Department of Economics and Administrative Sciences to form the Faculty of Administrative Sciences and Economics. The Faculty of Engineering and Architecture was created by combining the Faculty of Engineering with the Engineering Department of the &quot;Adana Academy of Administrative and Commercial Sciences&quot;. The Faculty of Education was also established through the unification of two-year Foreign Language Colleges from Adana, Mersin, and Hatay.

By 1992, the university played a key role in the establishment of three new universities in Turkey. Two colleges, equipped with modern facilities and laboratories, were transferred to Mersin University, three colleges to Hatay Mustafa Kemal University, and the Research and Application Center in Kahramanmaraş to Sütçü İmam University.

The university&#x27;s growth continued with the establishment of additional faculties, including Fisheries, Theology, Dentistry, and Fine Arts, bringing the total number of faculties to ten. New vocational colleges, such as the Adana Vocational College of Health and Kozan Vocational College, were opened. By incorporating three postgraduate institutes and the State Conservatory of Çukurova University, the number of academic bodies increased to 21.

Further expansions included the creation of the Karataş College of Tourism and Hotel Management in 1994, the Karaisalı Vocational College in 1995, and the Vocational College of Kadirli in 1997, which offered programs in Computer Programming and Industrial Electronics. The Department of Physical Education was reorganized as the College of Physical Education and Sports, and the Vocational College of Health Services became the College of Health Sciences in 1996.

== Campus ==
The Balcalı Campus of Çukurova University is located on the eastern side of Seyhan Lake, covering an area of 20 km2. The name &quot;Balcalı&quot; derives from the village that previously occupied the site before the university&#x27;s construction.The campus features administrative and educational buildings, including laboratories supporting research services across various disciplines. It also houses a hospital complex, a central library, a central cafeteria, sports facilities, faculty residences, social facilities, and dormitories with a total capacity of 3,500 students.

<doc id="1080255" wikidata="Q436135" url="?curid=1080255" title="Eyvind Earle">
<text>Eyvind Earle (April 26, 1916 – July 20, 2000) was an American artist, author and illustrator, noted for his contribution to the background illustration and styling of Disney&#x27;s animated films in the 1950s. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Rahr West Art Museum, Phoenix Art Museum and Arizona State University Art Museum have purchased Earle&#x27;s works for their permanent collections. His works have also been shown in many one-man exhibitions throughout the world.

==Early life ==
Eyvind Earle was born in New York on April 26, 1916 to General Ferdinand Pinney (F.P.) Earle and Charlotte Kristine Herman, F.P.&#x27;s fourth wife. The family moved to Hollywood in 1918, where F.P. worked as a film director and Earle&#x27;s mother was a piano teacher. The marriage was strained, and Earle&#x27;s father was heavily abusive toward his mother. A year after the couple&#x27;s marriage on October 7th 1915, F.P. was reported to have stabbed Charlotte with a pair of scissors while verbally and physically abusing her.

A childhood bout with polio affected muscles on the left side of Earle&#x27;s face. He began painting when he was 10 years old. Shortly after his artistic start, his parents divorced, leaving Eyvind in his mother&#x27;s custody for a period of time. During Earle&#x27;s early teenage years, he and his father traveled to Europe to study art. It was during this trip that Earle held his first solo art show in Paris at the age of 14.

==Career==
Earle&#x27;s first New York exhibition was at the Charles Morgan Galleries in 1937. In a 1939 exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art purchased one of his works for its permanent collection. His work at this time was realistic painting.

Starting in 1939 Earle began his long and successful career of selling Christmas cards, that he designed and printed himself for the American Artist Group. Starting out merely as a means of survival, he formed a Christmas card company called &quot;Monroe and Earle&quot; with an old family friend of his. He printed these cards with the help of Everett Ball, with whom he later formed a separate company by the name of &quot;Earle and Ball&quot;. He created over 800 designs between 1938 and 1995, and sold more than 300 million copies.

In 1951 he joined Walt Disney Productions as an assistant background painter and received credit for the experimental background painting in the Goofy short, &quot;For Whom the Bulls Toil&quot;. In 1953 he created the look of &quot;Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom&quot;, a short animated film which won an Academy Award and a Cannes Film Festival Award. He also worked on &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, &quot;Working for Peanuts&quot;, &quot;Pigs is Pigs&quot;, &quot;Paul Bunyan&quot;, and &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;. He was responsible for the styling, background and colors for the highly acclaimed &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;.

In 1961, Earle completed an 18-minute animated segment of the Nativity story for the Tennessee Ernie Ford hosted television special &quot;The Story Of Christmas&quot; on NBC.

Earle returned to full-time painting in 1966, producing watercolors, oils, sculptures, drawings, scratchboards, and limited-edition serigraphs. Much of this work was not exhibited in his lifetime.

He died of esophageal cancer in 2000.

==Legacy==

Earle was critically acclaimed by such publications as &quot;Time&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York World-Telegram&quot;, &quot;The Art News&quot; and &quot;The New York Sun&quot;.

Earle&#x27;s work and distinct graphic styling has continued to inspire new generations of artists and animators, serving to influence the look of other animated films. These have included the Disney features &quot;Pocahontas&quot; and &quot;Frozen&quot;, as well as the graphic style of Sony Pictures Animation&#x27;s debut film, &quot;Open Season&quot;.

The Banner Saga, a video game by developers Stoic, draws heavily from Earle&#x27;s style and contains a character named after him. He is credited for &#x27;Artistic Inspiration&#x27;.

In May 2017 The Walt Disney Family Museum hosted an 8-month original retrospective exhibit: &quot;Awaking Beauty: The Art of Eyvind Earle&quot;. An accompanying hard cover exhibition catalog was published under the same name .

==Awards==

In 1998, Earle was honored at the 26th Annie Awards with the Winsor McCay Award for a lifetime achievement in the art of animation.

In 2015, in a presentation at the D23 Expo in Anaheim, California, Earle was inducted as a Disney Legend. His daughter, Kristin Thompson, accepted on her father&#x27;s behalf.

Ferguson was the only Federal Reserve Governor in Washington, D.C., during the September 11 attacks in 2001. He was responsible for leading the Federal Reserve&#x27;s initial response to the terrorist attacks and was praised for his expert handling of the crisis.

While at the Fed, Ferguson led two working groups to improve the transparency of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decisions and the clarity of FOMC communication. These resulted in the release of a statement at the end of each FOMC meeting, explaining the rationale for the interest rate decision and including an assessment of the risks facing the economy.

While at the Fed, Ferguson served as Chairman of the Group of Ten Working Party on Financial Sector Consolidation. The Working Party released its final report on January 25, 2001.

Alan Greenspan has called Ferguson &quot;one of the most effective Vice Chairmen in the history of the Federal Reserve.&quot;

Ferguson proposed the idea of a journal dedicated to central banking theory and practice. The resulting International Journal of Central Banking was announced in 2004 and first published in 2005, with two objectives: to disseminate widely the best policy-relevant research on central banking and to promote communication among central banks. The IJCB has more than 50 sponsoring institutions.

With three co-authors, in November 2007 Ferguson published &quot;International Financial Stability&quot;, Geneva Report No. 9, dealing with challenges to global financial stability and including observations regarding the liquidity crisis of 2007.

The study was released on October 10, 2010.

Following two previous reports, the study expands on the role of conduct and culture in the governance of the world&#x27;s largest financial institutions. The report identifies shortcomings but also good practice in promoting a strong banking culture, making a series of recommendations that can be drawn upon by leaders as they seek to address culture in their firms.

<text>John Day Fossil Beds National Monument is a U.S. national monument in Wheeler and Grant counties in east-central Oregon. Located within the John Day River basin and managed by the National Park Service, the park is known for its well-preserved layers of fossil plants and mammals that lived in the region between the late Eocene, about 45 million years ago, and the late Miocene, about 5 million years ago. The monument consists of three geographically separate units: Sheep Rock, Painted Hills, and Clarno.

The units cover a total of of semi-desert shrublands, riparian zones, and colorful badlands. About 210,000 people visited the park in 2016 to engage in outdoor recreation or to visit the Thomas Condon Paleontology Center or the James Cant Ranch Historic District.

Before the arrival of Euro-Americans in the 19th century, the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and gathered roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, and a few small towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying the fossils in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.

Averaging about in elevation, the monument has a dry climate with temperatures that vary from summer highs of about to winter lows below freezing. The monument has more than 80 soil types that support a wide variety of flora, ranging from willow trees near the river to grasses on alluvial fans to cactus among rocks at higher elevations. Fauna include more than 50 species of resident and migratory birds. Large mammals like elk and smaller animals such as raccoons, coyotes, and voles frequent these units, which are also populated by a wide variety of reptiles, fish, butterflies, and other creatures adapted to particular niches of a mountainous semi-desert terrain.

==Geography==
The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument consists of three widely separated units—Sheep Rock, Painted Hills, and Clarno—in the John Day River basin of east-central Oregon. Located in rugged terrain in the counties of Wheeler and Grant, the park units are characterized by hills, deep ravines, and eroded fossil-bearing rock formations. To the west lies the Cascade Range, to the south the Ochoco Mountains, and to the east the Blue Mountains. Elevations within the park range from .

 The Clarno Unit, the westernmost of the three units, consists of located west of Fossil along Oregon Route 218. The Painted Hills Unit, which lies about halfway between the other two, covers . It is situated about northwest of Mitchell along Burnt Ranch Road, which intersects U.S. Route 26 west of Mitchell. These two units are entirely within Wheeler County. The remaining of the park, the Sheep Rock Unit, are located along Oregon Route 19 and the John Day River upstream of the unincorporated community of Kimberly. This unit is mostly in Grant County; a small part extends into Wheeler County. The Sheep Rock Unit is further subdivided into the Mascall Formation Overlook, Picture Gorge, the James Cant Ranch Historic District, Cathedral Rock, Blue Basin, and the Foree Area. Some of these are separated from one another by farms, ranches, and other parcels of land that are not part of the park.

 The park headquarters and main visitor center, both in the Sheep Rock Unit, are northeast of Bend and southeast of Portland by highway. The shortest highway distances from unit to unit within the park are Sheep Rock to Painted Hills, ; Painted Hills to Clarno, , and Clarno to Sheep Rock, .

The John Day River, a tributary of the Columbia River, flows generally west from the Strawberry Mountains before reaching the national monument. It turns sharply north between the Mascall Formation Overlook and Kimberly, where the North Fork John Day River joins the main stem. Downstream of Kimberly, the river flows generally west to downstream of the unincorporated community of Twickenham, and generally north thereafter. Rock Creek enters the river at the north end of Picture Gorge. Bridge Creek passes through Mitchell, then north along the eastern edge of the Painted Hills Unit to meet the John Day downstream of Twickenham. Intermittent streams in the Clarno Unit empty into Pine Creek, which flows just beyond the south edge of the unit and enters the John Day upstream of the unincorporated community of Clarno.

== History ==

Early inhabitants of north-central Oregon included Sahaptin-speaking people of the Umatilla, Wasco, and Warm Springs tribes as well as the Northern Paiutes, speakers of a Uto-Aztecan (Shoshonean) language. All were hunter-gatherers competing for resources such as elk, huckleberries, and salmon. Researchers have identified 36 sites of related archeological interest, including rock shelters and cairns, in or adjacent to the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument. Most significant among the prehistoric sites are the Picture Gorge pictographs, consisting of six panels of rock art in the canyon at the south end of the Sheep Rock Unit. The art is of undetermined origin and age but is &quot;centuries old&quot;.
The John Day basin remained largely unexplored by non-natives until the mid-19th century. Lewis and Clark noted but did not explore the John Day River while traveling along the Columbia River in 1805. John Day, for whom the river is named, apparently visited only its confluence with the Columbia in 1812. In 1829, Peter Skene Ogden, working for the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), led a company of explorers and fur trappers along the river through what would later become the Sheep Rock Unit. John Work, also of the HBC, visited this part of the river in 1831.

In the 1840s, thousands of settlers, attracted in part by the lure of free land, began emigrating west over the Oregon Trail. Leaving drought, worn-out farms, and economic problems behind, they emigrated from states like Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa in the Midwest to Oregon, especially the Willamette Valley in the western part of the state. After passage of the Homestead Act of 1862 and the discovery of gold in the upper John Day basin, a fraction of these newcomers abandoned the Willamette Valley in favor of eastern Oregon. Some established villages and engaged in subsistence farming and ranching near streams. Settlement was made more practical by a supply route from The Dalles on the Columbia River to gold mines at Canyon City in the upper John Day valley. By the late 1860s, the route became formalized as The Dalles Military Road, which passed along Bridge Creek and south of Sheep Rock. Clashes between natives and non-natives and the desire of the U.S. Government to populate the region with Euro-Americans led to the gradual removal of native residents to reservations, including three in north-central Oregon: Warm Springs, Burns Paiute, and Umatilla.
In 1864, a company of soldiers sent to protect mining camps from raids by Northern Paiutes discovered fossils in the Crooked River region, south of the John Day basin. One of their leaders, Captain John M. Drake, collected some of these fossils for Thomas Condon, a missionary pastor and amateur geologist who lived in The Dalles. Recognizing the scientific importance of the fossils, Condon accompanied soldiers traveling through the region. He discovered rich fossil beds along Bridge Creek and near Sheep Rock in 1865. Condon&#x27;s trips to the area and his public lectures and reports about his finds led to wide interest in the fossil beds among scientists such as Edward Drinker Cope of the Academy of Natural Sciences. One of them, paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh of Yale, accompanied Condon on a trip to the region in 1871. Condon&#x27;s work led to his appointment in 1872 as Oregon&#x27;s first state geologist and to international fame for the fossil beds. Specimens from the beds were sent to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums worldwide, and by 1900 more than 100 articles and books had been published about the John Day Fossil Beds. During the first half of the 20th century, scientists such as John C. Merriam, Ralph Chaney, Frank H. Knowlton, and Alonzo W. Hancock continued work in the fossil beds, including those discovered near Clarno in about 1890.

Remote and arid, the John Day basin near the fossil beds was slow to attract homesteaders. The first settler in what became the Sheep Rock Unit is thought to have been Frank Butler, who built a cabin along the river in 1877. In 1881, Eli Casey Officer began grazing sheep on a homestead claim in same general area. His son Floyd later lived there with his family and sometimes accompanied Condon on his fossil hunts. In 1910, James and Elizabeth Cant bought from the Officer family. and converted it to a sheep ranch, which was eventually expanded to a sheep-and-cattle ranch of about .
 Merriam, a University of California paleontologist who had led expeditions to the region in 1899 and 1900, encouraged the State of Oregon to protect the area. In the early 1930s the state began to buy land for state parks at Picture Gorge, the Painted Hills, and Clarno that later became part of the national monument. In 1951 the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry established Camp Hancock, a field school for young students of geology, paleontology, and other sciences, on public lands surrounded by what would later become the Clarno Unit. In 1974 Congress authorized the National Park Service to establish the national monument, and President Gerald R. Ford signed the authorization. After the State of Oregon had completed the land transfer of the three state parks to the federal government, the monument was officially established on October 8, 1975.
The Cant Ranch House and associated land and outbuildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the James Cant Ranch Historic District in 1984. After the monument opened in 1975, the ranch house served as headquarters for all three units. In 2005, the lower floor of the ranch house was opened to the public; it features exhibits about the cultural history of the region. The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center, a $7.5 million museum and visitor center at the Sheep Rock Unit, also opened in 2005. Among the center&#x27;s offerings are displays of fossils, murals depicting life in the basin during eight geologic times ranging from about 45 million to about 5 million years ago, and views of the paleontology laboratory.

In March 2011, the Park Service installed two webcams at the Sheep Rock Unit. Both transmit continuous real-time images; one shows the paleontology lab at the Condon Center and the other depicts Sheep Rock and nearby features. In June 2011, work was finished on a new ranger residence in the Painted Hills Unit that makes the unit almost carbon-neutral. Solar panels generate enough electricity to power the house as well as the ranger&#x27;s electric vehicle, on loan from its manufacturer for a year. The project is part of ongoing efforts to make the whole park carbon-neutral.

==Geology and paleontology==
The John Day Fossil Beds National Monument lies within the Blue Mountains physiographic province, which originated during the late Jurassic and early Cretaceous, about 118 to 93 million years ago. Northeastern Oregon was assembled in large blocks (exotic terranes) of Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic rock shifted by tectonic forces and accreted to what was then the western edge of the North American continent, near the Idaho border. By the beginning of the Cenozoic era, 66 million years ago, the Blue Mountains province was uplifting (that is, was being pushed higher by tectonic forces), and the Pacific Ocean shoreline, formerly near Idaho, had shifted to the west.

Volcanic eruptions about 44 million years ago during the Eocene deposited lavas accompanied by debris flows (lahars) atop the older rocks in the western part of the province. Containing fragments of shale, siltstone, conglomerates, and breccias, the debris flows entombed plants and animals caught in their paths; the remnants of these ancient flows comprise the rock formations exposed in the Clarno Unit. Preserved in the Clarno Nut Beds are fossils of tropical and subtropical nuts, fruits, roots, branches, and seeds. The Clarno Formation also contains bones, palm leaves longer than , avocado trees, and other subtropical plants from 50 million years ago, when the climate was warmer and wetter than it is in the 21st century. Large mammals that inhabited this region between 50 and 35 million years ago included browsers such as brontotheres and amynodonts, scavengers like the hyaenodonts, as well as &quot;Patriofelis&quot; and other predators. Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood, are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other buttes near Mitchell.

After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, they were replaced about 36 million years ago by eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of what would become the Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as they are called, emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20 million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as &quot;hydrangea&quot;, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the &quot;Metasequoia&quot; (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20th century.

After another period of erosion, a series of lava eruptions from fissures across northeastern Oregon, southeastern Washington, and western Idaho inundated much of the Blue Mountain province with liquid basalt. Extruded in the middle Miocene between 17 and 12 million years ago, more than 40 separate flows contributing to the Columbia River Basalt Group have been identified, the largest of which involved up to of lava. The most prominent of these formations within the monument is the Picture Gorge Basalt, which rests above the John Day Strata.

Subsequent ashfall from eruptions in the Cascade Range in the late Miocene contributed to the Mascall Formation, layers of stream-deposited volcanic tuffs laid atop the Picture Gorge Basalt. Preserved in the Mascall are fossils of animals such as horses, camels, rhinoceroses, bears, pronghorn, deer, weasels, raccoons, cats, dogs, and sloths. These fauna thrived in the monument&#x27;s open woodland and savannah between 15 and 12 million years ago. The fossils of oak, sycamore, maple, ginkgo, and elm trees reflect the area&#x27;s cool climate during this time period.

The last major eruption occurred in the late Miocene, about 7 million years ago. The resulting stratum, the Rattlesnake Formation, lies on top of the Mascall and contains an ignimbrite. The Rattlesnake stratum has fossils of mastodons, camels, rhinoceroses, the ancestors of dogs, lions, bears, and horses, and others that grazed on the grasslands of the time.
 Two fossilized teeth found recently in the Rattlesnake stratum near Dayville are the earliest record of beaver, &quot;Castor californicus&quot;, in North America. The beaver teeth, which are about 7 million years old, have been scheduled for display at the Condon Center.

 The monument contains extensive deposits of well-preserved fossils from various periods spanning more than 40 million years. Taken as a whole, the fossils present an unusually detailed view of plants and animals since the late Eocene. In addition, analysis of the John Day fossils has contributed to paleoclimatology (the study of Earth&#x27;s past climates) and the study of evolution.

Paleontologists at the monument find, describe the location of, and collect fossil-bearing rocks from more than 700 sites. They take them to the paleontology laboratory at the visitor center, where the fossils are stabilized, separated from their rock matrix, and cleaned. The fossil specimens are then catalogued, indexed, stored in climate-controlled cabinets, and made available for research. In addition to preparing fossils, the paleontologists coordinate the monument&#x27;s basic research in paleobotany and other scientific areas and manage the fossil museum in the visitor center.

==Climate==
Average precipitation, limited by the rain shadow effects of the Cascade Range and the Ochoco Mountains, varies from a year. In winter, much of the precipitation arrives as snow.

Weather data for the city of Mitchell, near the Painted Hills Unit, show that July and August are the warmest months, with an average high of and an average low of . January is the coldest month, when highs average and lows average . The highest recorded temperature in Mitchell was in 1972, and the lowest was in 1983. May is generally the wettest month, when precipitation averages .


==Biology==
===Flora===
 More than 80 soil types support a wide variety of flora within the monument. These soils stem from past and present geologic activity as well as ongoing additions of organic matter from life forms on or near the surface. Adapted to particular soil types and surface conditions, these plant communities range from riparian vegetation near the river to greasewood and saltgrass on the alluvial fans to plants such as hedgehog cactus in rocky outcrops at high elevation. Important to many of these communities is a black cryptobiotic crust that resists erosion, stores water, and fixes nitrogen used by the plants. The crust is composed of algae, lichens, mosses, fungi, and bacteria. Other areas of the monument have little or no flora. Volcanic tuffs and claystones that lack essential nutrients support few microorganisms and plants. Likewise, hard rock surfaces and steep slopes from which soils wash or blow away tend to remain bare.

Native grasses thrive in many parts of the monument despite competition from medusahead rye, Dalmatian toadflax, cheatgrass, and other invasive species. Bunchgrasses in the park include basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber&#x27;s needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, among others. Native grasses that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg&#x27;s bluegrass and other bluegrass species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.

Limited by their need for water, trees such as willows, alders, and ponderosa pines are found only near the monument&#x27;s streams or springs. Serviceberry bushes and shrubs like mountain mahogany are found in places where moisture collects near rock slides and ledges. Elsewhere long-rooted rabbitbrush has adapted to survive in dry areas. Other shrubs with adaptive properties include greasewood, sagebrush, shadscale, broom snakeweed, antelope bitterbrush, and purple sage. Western junipers, which have extensive root systems, thrive in the dry climate; in the absence of periodic fires they tend to displace grasses and sagebrush and to create relatively barren landscapes. The Park Service is considering controlled burning to limit the junipers and to create open areas for bunchgrasses that re-sprout from their roots after a fire.

Wildflowers, which bloom mainly in the spring and early summer, include pincushions, golden bee plant, dwarf purple monkey flower, and sagebrush mariposa lily at the Painted Hills Unit. Munro&#x27;s globemallow, lupines, yellow fritillary, hedgehog cactus, and Applegate&#x27;s Indian paintbrush are commonly seen at the Clarno and Sheep Rock units.

===Fauna===

Birds are the animals most often seen in the monument. Included among the more than 50 species observed are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor center include rufous hummingbirds, Say&#x27;s phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.

Large animals that frequent the park include elk, deer, cougar, and pronghorn. Beaver, otter, mink, and raccoons are found in or near the river. Coyotes, bats, and badgers are among the park&#x27;s other mammals. Predators hunt smaller animals such as the rabbits, voles, mice, and shrews found in the park&#x27;s grasslands and sagebrush-covered hills. Bushy-tailed woodrats inhabit caves and crevices in the monument&#x27;s rock formations. Bighorn sheep, wiped out in this region in the early 20th century, were reintroduced in the Foree Area of the Sheep Rock Unit in 2010.
Many habitats in the monument support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and western skinks. Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before being seen. The springs and seeps in the park contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific tree frogs, and long-toed salamanders.
A 2003–04 survey of the monument found 55 species of butterflies such as the common sootywing, orange sulphur, great spangled fritillary, and monarch. The monument&#x27;s other insects have not been completely inventoried.

The John Day River, which passes through the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed tributary of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument on their way to and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, when the water is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.

==Activities==
 Entrance to the park and its visitor center, museums, and exhibits is free, and trails, overlooks, and picnic sites at all three units are open during daylight hours year-round. No food, lodging, or fuel is available in the park, and camping is not allowed. Hours of operation for the Cant Ranch and its cultural museum vary seasonally. The Thomas Condon Paleontology Center is open every day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m except for federal holidays during the winter season from Veterans Day in November through Presidents&#x27; Day in February. Its amenities include a fossil museum, theater, education classroom, bookstore, restrooms, and drinking fountains. There is no cell phone or pay telephone service in the monument. Water taps at picnic areas are shut down in the colder months.

The Sheep Rock Unit has eight trails ranging in length from at the Mascall Formation Overlook to at Blue Basin. Four trails of a quarter-mile to long cross parts of the Painted Hills Unit. At the Clarno Unit, three separate quarter-mile trails begin at a parking lot along Oregon Route 218, below the face of the Clarno Palisades. Many of the trails have interpretive signs about the history, geology, and fossils of the region, and three trails—Story in Stone at the Sheep Rock Unit, and Painted Cove and Leaf Hill at the Painted Hills Unit—are accessible by wheelchair. Visitors are asked to stay on the trails and off bare rock and hardpan to avoid damage to fossils and fragile soils.

Ranger-led events at the monument have historically included indoor and outdoor talks, showings of an 18-minute orientation film, hikes in Blue Basin, Cant Ranch walking tours, and astronomy programs at the Painted Hills Unit. These events are free and most do not require reservations. Specific times for the activities are available from rangers at the monument. For students and teachers, the Park Service offers programs at the monument as well as fossil kits and other materials for classroom use.

Pets are allowed in developed areas and along hiking trails but must be leashed or otherwise restrained. Horses are not allowed on hiking trails, in picnic areas, or on bare rock exposures in undeveloped areas of the monument. Digging, disturbing, or collecting any of the park&#x27;s natural resources, including fossils, is prohibited. Fossil theft is an ongoing problem. No mountain biking is allowed on monument land, although the Malheur National Forest east of Dayville has biking trails. Fishing is legal from monument lands along the John Day River for anyone with an Oregon fishing license. Rafting on the John Day River is seasonally popular, although the favored runs begin at or downstream of Service Creek and do not pass through the monument. Risks to monument visitors include extremely hot summer temperatures and icy winter roads, two species of venomous rattlesnakes, two species of venomous spiders, ticks, scorpions, puncturevine, and poison ivy.

<text>SOBER-128 is a synchronous stream cipher designed by Hawkes and Rose (2003) and is a member of the SOBER family of ciphers. SOBER-128 was also designed to provide MAC (message authentication code) functionality.

Watanabe and Furuya (2004) showed a weakness in the MAC generation of SOBER-128 which means an attack could forge a message with probability 2−6. MAC functionality was deleted by Qualcomm from SOBER-128 reference code.

SOBER-128 takes a key up to 128 bits in length.

<text>The Liberia national football team, nicknamed the &quot;Lone Stars&quot;, represents Liberia in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Liberia Football Association. Although the nation produced the 1995 FIFA World Player of the Year, George Weah, its football team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup and has qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations just twice—in 1996 and 2002. It is a member of both FIFA and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

== History ==

===African Cup of Nations===
In 1965 Liberia played in first campaign 1965 qualification qualifying campaign, losing its first match 0–1 against Ivory Coast. They also won 3–2 against DR Congo however lost both returning fixtures and were eliminated in the first round.
In 1967 Liberia played in 1968 qualification qualifying campaign, drawing its first match 2–2 against Guinea. They also drew against Senegal however lost both returning fixtures and were eliminated in the first round. Liberia returned to qualifying in 1976 but lost in the preliminary round to Togo, falling to defeat in both fixtures. After another absence, Liberia again joined AFCON qualifying in 1982 in the preliminary rounds but failed to progress after two draws against Gambia, losing on the away goals rule.

Liberia withdrew from qualifying for the 1984 African Cup of Nations, but the following tournament they managed to secure their first win during qualifying, a 3–1 first-leg victory over Mauritania. They failed to capitalize on this advantage, losing 3–0 in the second leg. Liberia then faced Sierra Leone and Mali during the 1988 qualification and 1990 qualification respectively, but again failed to progress. In 1992, Liberia withdrew from qualifying before playing a match (possibly due to the ongoing First Liberian Civil War), and in 1994, Liberia was put into a group with two participants that withdrew during qualifying (Tanzania and Burkina Faso) however they failed to take advantage of this and finished with zero points, having lost to Ghana twice.

In the 1996 African Cup of Nations qualification, Liberia managed to register three wins (against Togo, Tunisia and Mauritania) and four draws, which saw them finish the group in second place and qualify for their first African Cup of Nations tournament. Following the withdrawal of Nigeria, Liberia was placed in a group with Gabon and Zaire. Liberia opened the tournament with a 2–1 victory over Gabon with goals from Kelvin Sebwe and Mass Sarr Jr. but lost 2–0 to Zaire. This meant that Liberia finished bottom of the group on goal difference and failed to progress to the knock-out stages.

Liberia missed out on returning to the African Cup of Nations in 1998 as they finished one point off of qualification. In 2000, they defeated Niger in the preliminary rounds, but again failed to advance to the main tournament, this time finishing behind Algeria on goal difference. 

In 2002 African Cup of Nations qualification, Liberia beat Cape Verde in the preliminary rounds, then they finished top of their group to qualify for the main tournament for the second time in their history. In the 2002 African Cup of Nations, Liberia drew their first game 1–1 with Mali (goal scored by George Weah) and drew their second game 2–2 against Algeria (goals from Prince Daye and Kelvin Sebwe), but in their final group game, needing a win against Nigeria, they lost 1–0.

=== FIFA World Cup ===

Liberia first entered the qualifying process for the FIFA World Cup in 1966, however, they withdrew in protest against the fact that too few places had been reserved for Africa and Asia, along with all fourteen other African nations that had initially entered qualifying. 

Liberia next entered qualifying in 1982 against Guinea after receiving a bye in the first round. They lost 1–0 over the two legs and were eliminated. In 1986, Liberia was again eliminated without having scored a goal, falling 4–0 to Nigeria. In 1990, Liberia won its first FIFA qualifying match defeating Ghana to progress to the second round. Despite finishing second in their group, Liberia failed to advance to the final qualification round, ending two points behind group winners Egypt.

In 1998, Liberia beat Gambia in the first qualification round, but finished twelve points adrift of Tunisia in their group. In 2002, Liberia had their strongest qualifying campaign, however, a loss against Ghana in their penultimate group game gave Nigeria the opportunity to overtake them and secure the only qualification spot.

<text>The British Rail Class 114 diesel multiple units were built by BR Derby from September 1956 to July 1957. Forty-nine 2-car units were built, numbered E50001-49 for driving motors (later renumbered 53001-49) and E56001-49 for driving trailers (later renumbered 54001-49). The units were used in the early days out of 40A Lincoln TMD (LN) on services all over the county, although a small number were transferred to 41A Sheffield (Darnall) during 1959/60. 

The vehicles were the first type to be built at Derby with the longer 63 ft 6 in underframe, and the first Derby vehicles to be built from steel. This design would be re-used in the 116 and 117. The type was classed a heavyweight unit; with their original BUT engines, they were found to be underpowered for the local scheduled services, and lost time especially when towing a van (which was a regular occurrence in that area). The most problematic stretch was the 1 in 122 for just under a mile near Ancaster which reduced these units to even on full power. As a result of this, several 3-car formations were put together using two power cars and one trailer. The type was re-engined with Leyland Albion 230 bhp motors. 

These were used in the main on Grantham - Boston/Skegness and Lincoln - Cleethorpes workings during 1957, and would be a familiar sight in the Lincolnshire area until the early 1990s.

==Formations==
Formations noted in Railway Observer magazine were E50008/E50007/E56007, E50011/E50012/E56012, E50038/E50039/E56015 and E50015/E50035/E56035. Spare trailers were stored at various locations - E56016/25/40 at Blankney &amp; Metheringham, E56010/39 at Bardney and E56004/20/22/37/38/44/45 near Sleaford South Junction. 

E50029/30/31/32/33/34 and their respective trailers were transferred to Stratford between February and April 1957 in exchange for Derby 2-car lightweight units, but between June and October the 114s moved back to Lincoln. 

==History==
E50049/E56049 was introduced with versions of the power unit, which proved to have a much more acceptable power to weight ratio, and during 1959 and 1960 all the class were fitted with these more powerful engines and settled down to work most Lincolnshire local services (with regular visits to South Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire) for over 25 years.
One of the class (one of the cars 50040) along with another 3-car unit was on one of the last passenger service from Louth to Grimsby on 20 December 1980. Other services where Cleethorpes to Barton-upon-Humber, Cleethorpes to Sheffield via Retford, and Peterborough to Grimsby via Boston, Willoughby and Louth.

The units were rarely seen outside of their normal working area, but in June 1957 E50029/E56029 worked a special excursion from Ipswich to Chessington South.

Later in their life, they were moved to the Tyseley TMD (TS) West Midlands, but still came back to the Lincolnshire area on a regular basis.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 25 January 1963, a set working the Grantham - Lincoln Central service collided with the rear (tender) of a stationary Class B1 steam locomotive near Bracebridge Gas Sidings Signalbox near Lincoln. Two people were killed and three injured.
* On 12 February 1968, the 06:48 Sheffield - Cleethorpes was hit in the rear by a coal train ran. The Class 114 had a parcel van as a tail load which took the force of the impact, but the rear cab was still severely crushed.
* On 28 November 1969, 50031 + 56031 ran through level crossing gates at Great Coates level crossing near Grimsby, striking a Dodge articulated lorry and carrying it 46 feet into the station. 3 people needed hospital treatment. The driver had run a red signal.
* On 28 January 1970, 56020 &amp; 50020, travelling at 50mph, struck a tanker traversing Dowdyke Bank level crossing between Spalding &amp; Boston.
* On 9 December 1983, 53049 + 54049 working the 17:32 Cleethorpes - Sheffield collided with the 15:02 Drax - Lindsey (900-tons of empty oil tanks hauled by 47299) at Wrawby junction, a convergence of lines just outside Barnetby, Lincolnshire. One passenger was killed.
* On 26 July 1986, 53016 + 54034, coupled to Class 105 54434 + 51278, collided with a van that had driven onto Lockington Level Crossing against flashing lights. 54434 derailed and ran down the embankment, turning 180 degrees before coming to rest on its side. All vehicles were badly damaged. Nine people were killed.

==Prototype unit==
In addition to the 49 production units, a fiftieth two-car unit (cars 50000 and 56000) was built to test the Rolls-Royce engine type and hydraulic transmission later used on the Class 127 units. Initially the unit underwent trials on the Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith railway in early 1957, but was subsequently also allocated to Lincoln and worked the same diagrams as the other 49. The unit was withdrawn in October 1967 as it was deemed to be non-standard, thus never received an official TOPS class designation.

==Withdrawal==
The units were replaced by newer &quot;Sprinter&quot; units in the late 1980s. By 1992, only two units were still in service, based at Tyseley depot in Birmingham, and all were withdrawn by July of that year. The final set, T027, was eventually preserved at Midland Railway Centre, Butterley.

==Non-passenger use==

Five units were rebuilt as parcels units with roller-shutter doors in 1988. These were repainted in Royal Mail red livery, and were based at Cambridge depot. They were withdrawn in 1991. Four of the units were scrapped, whilst the fifth was rebuilt as a test train for the new ATP. This unit passed into EWS ownership with the privatisation of Britain&#x27;s railways. It was then used in a new role of a route-learner unit, until it was withdrawn in 2002. It was eventually preserved in 2004.

Parcels cars - converted in 1986 
All were allocated to CA. Initially only the seats were removed, although later a more substantial conversion was carried out, including the fitting of roller shutter doors, with two sets of these on the DTCs where the vestibules/passenger doors had been.

==Departmental==
ADB 977775/6 were converted into an Automatic Train Protection demonstration train and fitted with both types of ATP systems from the BR pilot schemes c1991. Following the abandonment of ATP development, the unit found a new lease of life with EWS as a route learning and inspection saloon based initially at Margam South Wales.

==Preservation==

Only two sets have been preserved on heritage railways.

<doc id="1080292" wikidata="Q855216" url="?curid=1080292" title="Two Concepts of Liberty">
<text>&quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot; was the inaugural lecture delivered by the liberal philosopher Isaiah Berlin before the University of Oxford on 31 October 1958. It was subsequently published as a 57-page pamphlet by Oxford at the Clarendon Press. It also appears in the collection of Berlin&#x27;s papers entitled &quot;Four Essays on Liberty&quot; (1969) and was reissued in a collection entitled &quot;Liberty: Incorporating Four Essays on Liberty&quot; (2002).

The essay, with its analytical approach to the definition of political concepts, re-introduced the study of political philosophy to the methods of analytic philosophy. It is also one of Berlin&#x27;s first expressions of his ethical ontology of value-pluralism. Berlin defined negative liberty (as the term &quot;liberty&quot; was used by Thomas Hobbes) as the absence of coercion or interference with agents&#x27; possible private actions, by an exterior social body. He also defined it as a comparatively recent political ideal, which re-emerged in the late 17th century, after its slow and inarticulate birth in the ancient doctrines of Antiphon the Sophist, the Cyrenaic discipleship, and of Otanes after the death of pseudo-Smerdis. In an introduction to the essay, Berlin writes:
As for Otanes, he wished neither to rule nor to be ruled—the exact opposite of Aristotle&#x27;s notion of true civic liberty... [This ideal] remains isolated and, until Epicurus, undeveloped ... the notion had not explicitly emerged.

== Summary ==
Berlin initially defined negative liberty as &quot;freedom from&quot;, that is, the absence of constraints on the agent imposed by other people. He defined positive liberty both as &quot;freedom to&quot;, that is, the ability (not just the opportunity) to pursue and achieve willed goals; and also as autonomy or self-rule, as opposed to dependence on others. 

=== Negative liberty ===
Berlin said that negative liberty is:
liberty in the negative sense involves an answer to the question: &#x27;What is the area within which the subject—a person or group of persons—is or should be left to do or be what he is able to do or be, without interference by other persons?&#x27;

For Berlin, negative liberty represents a different, and sometimes contradictory, understanding of the concept of liberty, which needs to be carefully examined. Its later proponents (such as Tocqueville, Constant, Montesquieu, John Locke, David Hume and John Stuart Mill, who accepted Chrysippus&#x27; understanding of self-determination) insisted that constraint and discipline were the antithesis of liberty and so were (and are) less prone to confusing liberty and constraint in the manner of rationalists and the philosophical harbingers of totalitarianism. This concept of negative liberty, Berlin argued, constitutes an alternative, and sometimes even opposed, concept to positive liberty, and one often closer to the intuitive modern usage of the word. Berlin considered negative liberty one of the distinguishing concepts of modern liberalism and observed that:

The fathers of liberalism—Mill and Constant—want more than this minimum: they demand a maximum degree of non-interference compatible with the minimum demands of social life. It seems unlikely that this extreme demand for liberty has ever been made by any but a small minority of highly civilized and self-conscious human beings.

=== Positive liberty ===
Berlin said that positive liberty:is involved in the answer to the question &#x27;What, or who, is the source of control or interference that can determine someone to do, or be, this rather than that?&#x27;

Positive liberty may be understood as self-mastery. Berlin granted that both concepts of liberty represent valid human ideals, and that both forms of liberty are necessary in any free and civilised society.

=== Suggestions that positive liberty is &quot;abuse&quot; in context ===
Isaiah Berlin notes that historically positive liberty has proven particularly susceptible to rhetorical abuse; especially from the 18th century onwards, it has either been paternalistically re-drawn from the third-person, or conflated with the concept of negative liberty and thus disguised underlying value-conflicts.

Berlin contended that under the influence of Plato, Aristotle, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant, and G. W. F. Hegel, modern political thinkers often conflated positive liberty with rational action, based upon a rational knowledge to which, it is argued, only a certain elite or social group has access. This rationalist conflation was open to political abuses, which encroached on negative liberty, when such interpretations of positive liberty were, in the nineteenth century, used to defend nationalism, paternalism, social engineering, historicism, and collective rational control over human destiny. Berlin argued that, following this line of thought, demands for freedom paradoxically could become demands for forms of collective control and discipline—those deemed necessary for the &quot;self-mastery&quot; or &quot;self-determination&quot; of nations, classes, democratic communities, and even humanity as a whole. There is thus an elective affinity, for Berlin, between positive liberty, when it is rhetorically conflated with goals imposed from the third-person that the individual is told they &quot;should&quot; rationally desire, and the justifications for political totalitarianism, which contrary to value-pluralism, presupposed that values exist in Pythagorean harmony. 

=== Dialectic of positive and negative liberty ===
Berlin did not argue that the concept of positive liberty should be rejected—on the contrary, he recognised it as one human value among many, and one necessary to any free society. He argued that positive liberty was a genuine and valuable version of liberty, so long as it was identified with the autonomy of individuals, and not with the achievement of goals that individuals &#x27;ought to&#x27; &#x27;rationally&#x27; desire. Berlin argued, rather, that these differing concepts showed the plurality and incompatibility of human values, and the need to analytically distinguish and trade off between, rather than conflate, them.

Thus, Berlin offers in his &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot; essay:Where it is to be drawn is a matter of argument, indeed of haggling. Men are largely interdependent, and no man&#x27;s activity is so completely private as never to obstruct the lives of others in any way. &#x27;Freedom for the pike is death for the minnows&#x27;; the liberty of some must depend on the restraint of others. Freedom for an Oxford don, others have been known to add, is a very different thing from freedom for an Egyptian peasant.

==Criticism==
In contrast to Berlin, Charles Taylor argues that the Hobbes-Bentham view is indefensible as a view of freedom. Faced with this two-step process, it seems safer and easier to stop it at the first step, to insist firmly that freedom is just a matter of the absence of external obstacles, that it, therefore, involves no discrimination of motivation and permits in principle no second-guessing of the subject by anyone else. Taylor suggests that this is the essence of the Maginot Line strategy and it is very tempting, as a line of argument. But, claims it is wrong, we cannot defend a view of freedom that does not involve at least some qualitative discrimination as to motive, that is which does not put some restrictions on motivation among the necessary conditions for freedom, and hence which could rule out second-guessing in principle.

Taylor, therefore, argues for a distinction between negative and positive liberty that highlights the importance of social justice. Therefore, if social justice is a major part of equality, then liberty is not a synonym of lack of obstacles, but being able to grasp those obstacles, to discuss and work to overcome them.

In 2006, historian Bernard Bailyn published a critique of &quot;perfectionist ideas&quot; found in &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty.&quot; He triangulated his own approach with Berlin&#x27;s &quot;embattled position in defense of a liberal alternative&quot; and &quot;perfectionist ideas&quot;, the latter a result of positive liberty as a totality. Bailyn introduced his final collection of essays by asserting that &quot;Isaiah Berlin was wrong in his entertaining game of classifying writers and thinkers into hedgehogs, who focus on one great theme, and foxes, who study and write about many themes and see the world through many lenses--wrong at least as far as historians are concerned. Many, like me, are both.&quot;

<text>Adam Derek Scott (born 16 July 1980) is an Australian professional golfer. In 2000, Scott turned professional and quickly earned European Tour membership. He won four tour events early in his career. In 2004, Scott won The Players Championship, the flagship event on the PGA Tour, and has focused on the United States since then. In the early 2010s, Scott began his greatest stretch of his career. He won the 2011 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, finished runner-up 2012 Open Championship, and won the 2013 Masters Tournament. In 2014, Scott won The Colonial earning the world #1 ranking for first time. Since then Scott&#x27;s success has endured, winning multiple international tournaments.

==Early life==
Scott was born in Adelaide, South Australia, where he attended the Lady George Kindergarten and moved with his family at the age of nine to the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, where he attended Matthew Flinders Anglican College. They then settled on the Gold Coast, Queensland in 1993 when Scott was 12 years of age. Initially at The Southport School, an Anglican boys&#x27; school on the Gold Coast, he completed his high school education at The Kooralbyn International School, located in the Scenic Rim Region, where he undertook extra subjects in golf. He was a member of the Golf Australia National Squad.

== Amateur career ==
Scott won the Australian Boys&#x27; Amateur in 1997 and 1998. He was also a member of the Golf Australia National Squad. Scott later attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) in the United States.

==Professional career==

===European Tour===
Scott turned professional midway through the 2000 season. He earned his card for the 2001 European Tour season in just eight starts as a professional, his best result being a tie for sixth at the Linde German Masters. Scott also made a handful of appearances on the PGA Tour but made only one cut in six events.

In Scott&#x27;s first full year as a professional golfer he won the European Tour&#x27;s Alfred Dunhill Championship in Johannesburg, South Africa for his first professional title. This event was Scott&#x27;s first start of the year and was co-sanctioned by the European and Sunshine Tours. He beat Justin Rose to the title by one stroke. Scott had three other top-3 finishes throughout the season and went on to finish 13th in the Order of Merit in his first season.

The following year in 2002, Scott had two victories on the European Tour and a final position of seventh on the Order of Merit. His first win of the year was a six-shot victory at the Qatar Masters. Later in the year, Scott won the Gleneagles Scottish PGA Championship, shooting a final round of 63 to win by ten shots. In between these victories, Scott made his debut at the Masters Tournament, where he finished tied for 9th.
In 2003, Scott made it to the semifinals of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, but fell to eventual champion Tiger Woods on the 19th hole. He had previously beaten Bernhard Langer, Rocco Mediate, Kevin Sutherland, and Jay Haas en route to the semis, then defeated fellow Australian Peter Lonard 1 up in the consolation match. In August 2003, Scott won his fourth European Tour title at the Scandinavian Masters by two strokes over Nick Dougherty. A month later he followed it up with his first victory on the PGA Tour at the inaugural Deutsche Bank Championship. The win came in his 34th career start on the PGA Tour. He shot a course record 62 in the second round to lead by two at the halfway stage and went on to win by four from Rocco Mediate. At the end of the year he made his first appearance on the International team at the Presidents Cup in South Africa, contributing three points out of five, en route to a 17–17 tie.

Scott won the flagship event of the tour, The Players Championship; He had a two-stroke lead on the 72nd tee, but found the water hazard with his approach to the green. However, he sealed the title with a 40-yard up and down, which included a ten-footer for bogey to win by a shot over runner-up Pádraig Harrington. He became the youngest winner of The Players Championship at 23 years old. Three months later, Scott collected this third PGA Tour win, with victory at the Booz Allen Classic. He equalled the tournament total record at 21-under-par to win by four from Charles Howell III.

Early in 2005 he won the Nissan Open, but as the tournament was shortened to 36 holes due to heavy rain, it is not recognised as an official victory. Sharing the halfway lead with Chad Campbell, they played off to determine the winner, with Scott winning on the first playoff hole. Thus, he reached the top ten of the Official World Golf Rankings for the first time in his career. He has since spent over 400 weeks in the top-10 of the rankings. Several months later, Scott won his fifth European Tour title with victory at the Johnnie Walker Classic in Beijing, China. He shot a course record 63 on the way to a three-shot victory. Scott also won the Singapore Open later in 2005 on the Asian Tour by seven strokes over Lee Westwood.

=== PGA Tour ===
Scott played less frequently on the European Tour from 2006 onwards, focusing more on the PGA Tour. He had a successful year, recording one victory alongside three runners up finishes and three-third places. He finished tied third at the PGA Championship, which was his best showing at a major championship. He then went on later in the year to finish tied second at the WGC-American Express Championship, finishing eight strokes behind Tiger Woods. At the end of the year, Scott won the season-ending Tour Championship by three strokes for his fourth career PGA Tour win and finished third on the PGA Tour money list for 2006.

The 2007 season started for Scott with a second-place finish at the season opening Mercedes Benz Championship in Hawaii behind Vijay Singh. After this, Scott reached his career high ranking of world number three. He then won for the fifth time on the PGA Tour, the week before the Masters, at the Shell Houston Open. After hitting his tee shot into the water on the 72nd hole, he made a 48-foot par putt to seal a three stroke victory over Stuart Appleby and Bubba Watson. He then played consistently for the rest of the year, qualifying for all four FedEx Cup playoff events and finishing 10th in the final standings.

In 2008, he played enough events on the European Tour to qualify for playing on the Order of Merit for the first time since 2005. Scott endured a somewhat difficult season in 2008 with injury and illness, but he managed to win once on each tour. In January 2008 he started off the year in fine style by winning his sixth career title on the European Tour at the Qatar Masters. Scott carded a 11-under-par final round of 61, which was both a course record and personal best round. He started his final round three shots behind the overnight leader and won the tournament by finishing three shots ahead of Henrik Stenson.

In April 2008, Scott won the EDS Byron Nelson Championship in a playoff against Ryan Moore. Scott holed a nine-foot putt to make the playoff on the 72nd hole. The playoff started with Moore and Scott making pars on the first two extra holes before Scott holed a dramatic 48-foot birdie putt at the third extra hole for the victory. At the 2008 U.S. Open, World No. 1 Tiger Woods, World No. 2 Phil Mickelson and World No. 3 Scott were all paired together in the first two rounds of the tournament. Woods won in a playoff, Mickelson finished in 18th, and Scott finished in 26th. He ended the year 39th on the money list. Scott&#x27;s form dipped badly in 2009 as he dropped out of the top 50 in the world rankings and finished the year outside of the top 100 on the PGA Tour money list. He finished 108th on the money list which is his worst ever placing in his career. In 19 events on the PGA Tour, he missed the cut 10 times, with his only top 10 finish coming at the Sony Open in Hawaii in January. He did however win at the end of year in December at his home championship, the Australian Open, for his first victory on home soil in his career.

Despite a quiet couple of years Scott won his seventh career PGA Tour title at the Valero Texas Open in May 2010, prevailing in a 36 hole long Sunday to finish one stroke ahead of Swede Freddie Jacobson. It was Scott&#x27;s first PGA Tour victory for two years. He qualified and played in all the FedEx Cup playoffs, finishing 27th at the Tour Championship. In November, Scott won the Barclays Singapore Open for the third time in his career, having previously triumphed in 2005 and 2006. It was also his seventh title on the European Tour.

Scott achieved his best finish at a major championship when he finished in a tie for second place at the 2011 Masters Tournament alongside compatriot Jason Day, two strokes behind the winner Charl Schwartzel. Scott had held the sole lead of the tournament while playing the 71st hole, but four birdies in a row from Schwartzel meant Scott fell short by two strokes.

With Tiger Woods injured at the U.S. Open, and The Open Championship in 2011, Woods&#x27;s caddie Steve Williams caddied for Scott. After Woods fired Williams on 20 July, Williams became Scott&#x27;s permanent caddie. The two enjoyed their first win together on 7 August 2011 when Scott triumphed at the 2011 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, earning him his first career World Golf Championship and eighth title overall on both of the main tours. He beat Luke Donald and Rickie Fowler by four strokes after a bogey-free final round of 65, becoming the 20th different player to win a World Golf Championship event. Scott returned to the world&#x27;s top 10 for the first time in over two years after his win, re-entering at ninth.

In attempting to become the first player to win a major the week after winning a tour event since Tiger Woods in 2007, Scott finished tied seventh at the PGA Championship. Scott was one of six players to post two top 10 finishes at majors in 2011. He then held the 36 hole lead at the season ending Tour Championship, before rounds of 74-68 led to a tied sixth finish. Scott ended the year number 16 in the standings. In November 2011, Scott was one of five Australians in the President&#x27;s Cup team that lost to the United States in Australia. Scott ended with a 2–3–0 record.

Scott started the year at the Northern Trust Open, where he finished in a tie for 17th. In April, Scott enjoyed his second consecutive top-10 at the Masters Tournament when he finished T8th. He shot a final round 66, which included a hole-in-one at the 16th hole, to advance up the leaderboard on the final day. In the years second major championship, Scott had his best result at the U.S. Open with a tie for 15th at the Olympic Club. He shot three consecutive rounds of 70 in rounds two, three and four. Then in the build-up to The Open Championship, Scott finished in third at the AT&amp;T National.

At the 2012 Open Championship, Scott equalled the course record for Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes Golf Club at an Open Championship when he shot a six-under-par round of 64 to lead by one stroke after the first round. This was then matched by American Brandt Snedeker in the second round, to lead Scott by one stroke going into the weekend after Scott had recorded a round of 67. In the third round, Scott shot a 68 to take a four stroke lead into the final round, ahead of Brandt Snedeker and Graeme McDowell.

In the final round, Scott&#x27;s birdie on the 14th gave him a cushion of four shots with four holes to play. On the 15th, Scott made bogey after he pulled his approach shot into a greenside bunker. At the 16th he overhit his approach shot onto the back of the green to leave a lengthy putt for birdie. He missed the putt by about five feet and could not convert the par putt. As Scott was playing the 17th, Ernie Els had birdied the final hole to become the leader in the clubhouse at seven under, one shot behind Scott. On the 17th, from the middle of the fairway, Scott overhit his approach shot and landed in some thick rough at the back of the green. He could only pitch out to 20 feet away and missed the resulting putt to record his third bogey and drop into a tie for the lead with Els.

At the final hole, needing a birdie to win or a par to get into a playoff with Els, Scott found a bunker off the tee and his ball ended up tight underneath the lip. He was only able to pitch out sideways. For his third stroke he played an iron shot to leave himself with an eight-foot par putt to take the championship to a playoff. Scott narrowly missed the putt on the outside edge of the hole, resulting in another bogey to finish the round. Scott shot a final round of 75 to finish at six under, one stroke behind the champion Ernie Els.

Scott&#x27;s collapse down the home stretch was compared to many other famous golfing collapses down the years including fellow countryman Greg Norman at the 1996 Masters. After the round Scott said that his finish was down to finding some bad positions on the course, rather than nerves. He also said &quot;I&#x27;m very disappointed but I played so beautifully for most of the week I really shouldn&#x27;t let this bring me down. I know I&#x27;ve let a really great chance slip through my fingers today, but somehow I&#x27;ll look back and take the positives from it.&quot; With his second-place finish, Scott equalled his best ever performance at a major championship, alongside his tied second at the 2011 Masters and he returned to the world&#x27;s top 10, at number six.

Scott&#x27;s first appearance after The Open Championship was at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he attempted to defend his title from the previous year. He ended the week in a tie for 45th place. The following week, Scott was again in the mix at the PGA Championship, entering the final round in the penultimate grouping, four shots behind the leader Rory McIlroy. In good conditions though, Scott shot an over par 73 to drop back into a final position of T11th.

On 18 November, Scott fired a bogey-free final round at Kingston Heath in the Melbourne Sandbelt, to win the Australian Masters for the first time. He trailed defending champion Ian Poulter by one going into the final round, but shot a 67, including a birdie on the last, to don the &quot;Gold Jacket&quot; for Masters champion.

Scott opened the season at the Northern Trust Open, well into February of that year. He finished the event T10th with three rounds under par. He then played the two World Golf Championships consecutively, losing at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in the opening round 2&amp;1 to Tim Clark. In the following WGC-Cadillac Championship, Scott fired the low round of the week on the final day to jump from T19 to T3 behind Tiger Woods and Steve Stricker. His last event before the Masters, was at the Tampa Bay Championship where he finished T30.

At the 2013 Masters Tournament, Scott emerged from the chasing pack on the final day to enter into a tie for the lead heading into the 72nd hole. Scott proceeded to birdie the 18th hole. However, former champion Ángel Cabrera also birdied the 72nd hole to tie Scott for the lead at −9, leading to a sudden-death playoff. Both players parred the first hole (18) with Cabrera inches away from birdie. On the second hole (10), Cabrera once again missed his birdie putt by inches, leaving Scott a 12-foot birdie putt for the championship, which Scott holed. It was Scott&#x27;s first major championship and marked the first time an Australian has won the Masters. It was also seen by many as redemption for his failure to win the previous year&#x27;s Open Championship.

Scott&#x27;s victory at the Masters moved him to No. 3 in the Official World Golf Ranking, equalling his career high ranking.

Scott finished in a tie for 45th place at the U.S. Open. Scott took a one-stroke lead heading into the back nine on the final day of the Open Championship before eventually finishing in a tie for third. The final major of 2013, the PGA Championship, saw Scott finish in a tie for fifth. At the first event of the FedEx Cup Playoffs, The Barclays, Scott finished with a 66 (−5) final round to win over four players by one stroke and move to number two in the World Ranking, a career high.

In October, Scott won the 2013 PGA Grand Slam of Golf event in which the four major winners of that year compete. A month later Scott would win in his native Australia, when he won the Australian PGA Championship, his fourth career victory on the PGA Tour of Australasia. This was quickly followed by winning the Australian Masters on 16 November, at Royal Melbourne, finishing 14 shots under par. The following week Scott would garner victory in the team portion of ISPS Handa World Cup of Golf, with fellow Australian Jason Day. The team shot a combined 17-under-par. Day won the individual championship at 10-under-par. Scott was runner up to Rory McIlroy in the Emirates Australian Open on 1 December 2013. He led by one stroke going into the final hole but a bogey by Scott and a birdie by McIlroy saw a two shot swing and victory to the Northern Irishman. Scott would finish 2013 as the World&#x27;s #2 ranked golfer.
In March 2014, Scott tied the course record at Bay Hill Club &amp; Lodge, when he shot a 10-under-par 62 during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational. He went on to finish third in the tournament behind the winner Matt Every and Keegan Bradley after a poor four-over-par 76 in the final round.

On 19 May 2014, Scott took over as the World&#x27;s #1 ranked golfer. Scott is the 17th golfer to be ranked number one since official rankings began. He is also the second Australian and the first since Greg Norman in 1998. A week after becoming world #1, Scott strengthened his ranking with a win at the Crowne Plaza Invitational at Colonial, being the first person to win all four Texas-based PGA Tour events. Scott held the number one ranking for eleven weeks until August 2014.

Scott started the season well with a runner-up finish at the CIMB Classic during the wrap-around 2016 season. He then followed this up during February 2016, with another runner-up placing at the Northern Trust Open, where despite a final hole chip-in birdie, he finished a shot behind winner Bubba Watson.

On 28 February 2016, Scott won his 12th PGA Tour title with victory at The Honda Classic played at PGA National Golf Club. He won by a single stroke over Sergio García to end a near two-year winless drought. This was also Scott&#x27;s first win with the short putter, following the long putter ban issued in 2016, in over five years since the 2010 Singapore Open. A notable footnote to Scott&#x27;s victory was also that he became the first player to make a quadruple bogey on the weekend and win the tournament, since Phil Mickelson at the 2009 Tour Championship. The win moved Scott back into the world&#x27;s top ten, at number nine.

The following week, Scott claimed back-to-back victories with a one stroke victory at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. This was Scott&#x27;s second victory in a WGC event and was the first time in his career, he had claimed back-to-back wins. He had begun the final round, three strokes back of overnight leader Rory McIlroy, but shot a three-under round of 69 and had to hole a six-foot putt for the par on the final green to take the victory. This coming after Scott made two double-bogeys on the front nine on the third and fifth holes to fall behind the leaders, but then followed this up with six birdies in his next nine holes. The win moved Scott up to number six in the rankings.

In April, Scott announced that he would not be participating in the 2016 Olympic Games, citing &#x27;an extremely busy playing schedule&#x27;. International Golf Federation chief executive Peter Dawson branded Scott&#x27;s decision, as well as other high-profile golfers, &#x27;regrettable&#x27;, while Gary Player said players who chose to opt out of playing in Rio de Janeiro were &#x27;hurting&#x27; the game. However, Scott&#x27;s fellow countryman Marcus Fraser rushed to his defence, branding criticism of his decision &#x27;absolute garbage&#x27;.

In September 2017, Scott&#x27;s part-time caddie Steve Williams announced that he would no longer be working for him after the end of the year, saying that he wanted to go back to having a full-time caddie from the start of 2018 onwards.

In December 2019, Scott won the Australian PGA Championship for the second time in his career. It was his first win since the 2016 WGC-Cadillac Championship. 
In February 2020, he claimed his first title on the PGA Tour in nearly four years, winning the Genesis Invitational at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, California.

In August 2021, Scott missed out in a five-way play-off at the Wyndham Championship after 72 holes, missing a short putt on the first extra hole to win before Kevin Kisner won on the second extra hole.

Scott qualified for the International team at the 2022 Presidents Cup; he won two and lost three of the five matches he played.

Scott is the touring professional at the Sanctuary Cove Golf &amp; Country Club, where he resides while in Australia, located on the Gold Coast, Queensland.

== Personal life ==
For tax purposes, Scott is a resident of Switzerland.

In 2010, Scott was in a relationship with former tennis World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, but they separated in September of that year. The pair reunited in 2011, before splitting up for good one year later.

In April 2014, Scott married Marie Kojzar, a Swedish architect, in a small ceremony in the Bahamas. Scott and Kojzar had previously been in a long-term relationship in the early to mid-2000s, before splitting up and then reuniting in 2013. In February 2015, the couple announced the arrival of their daughter, who was born at Pindara Private Hospital in Queensland, Australia.
On 18 August 2017, the couple announced the arrival of their second child, a son.

== Awards and honors ==

* In June 2022, Scott was appointed Member of the Order of Australia in the 2022 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for &quot;significant service to golf at the elite level&quot;.

<text>Tetritskaro or Tetritsqaro (; , ) is a town in Kvemo Kartli in southern Georgia. It is the municipal center of Tetritsqaro Municipality. According to 2014 Georgian Census its population is 3,093. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway which opened in 2017, runs along the rail line through the town.

==History==
Original settlement on this location was called &quot;Garisi&quot; (გარისი), but due to invasions and wars this place got abandoned and in the beginning of the 19th century became a ghost town. Later, this area was resettled by Georgian Azerbaijanis, who called the settlement &quot;Agbulakhi&quot;; the name was of Azerbaijani origin and literally meant &quot;white spring&quot;. In 1940, the name was changed to Tetri-Tskaro, which, in Georgian, also means &quot;white spring&quot;. Town status was granted to it in 1966.

<doc id="1080319" wikidata="Q2134778" url="?curid=1080319" title="Airport novel">
<text>The airport novel represents a literary genre that is defined not so much by its plot or cast of stock characters, but by the social function it serves. Designed to meet the demands of a very specific market, airport novels are superficially engaging while not being necessarily profound, usually written to be more entertaining than philosophically challenging. An airport novel is typically a fairly long but fast-paced boilerplate genre-fiction novel commonly offered by airport newsstands.

Considering the marketing of fiction as a trade, airport novels occupy a niche similar to the one that once was occupied by pulp magazines and other reading materials typically sold at newsstands and kiosks to travellers. In French, such novels are called &quot;romans de gare&quot;, &#x27;railway station novels&#x27;, suggesting that publishers in France were aware of this potential market at a very early date. The somewhat dated Dutch term &quot;stationsroman&quot; is a &quot;calque&quot; from French.

==Format==
Airport novels are typically quite long; a book that a reader finished before the journey was done would similarly be unsatisfying. Because of this length, the genre attracts prolific authors, who use their outputs as a sort of branding; each author is identified with a certain sort of story, and they produce many variations of the same thing. Well-known authors&#x27; names are usually in type larger than the title on the covers of airport novels, often in embossed letters.

==Themes==
Airport novels typically fall within a number of other fiction genres, including:

* Crime fiction
* Detective fiction
* Historical romance
* Spy fiction
* Thrillers

Whatever the genre, the books must be fast-paced and easy to read. The description &quot;airport novel&quot; is mildly pejorative; it implies that the book has little lasting value, and is useful chiefly as an inexpensive form of entertainment during travel. Airport novels are sometimes contrasted with literary fiction, so that a novel with literary aspirations would be disparaged by the label.

==History==
Early in the history of rail transport in Great Britain, as longer trips became more common, travelers wanted to read more than newspapers. Railway station newsstands began selling inexpensive books, what &quot;The Times&quot; in 1851 described as &quot;French novels, unfortunately, of questionable character.&quot; Sales were so high that &quot;Athenaeum&quot; in 1849 predicted that railway newsstands might replace traditional bookstores.

By 1851, WH Smith had about 35 bookstores in British railway stations. Although &quot;Athenaeum&quot; reported that year that the company &quot;maintain[ed] the dignity of literature by resolutely refusing to admit pernicious publications&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;—noting the enormous success of &quot;The Parlour Library&quot;—surmised that &quot;persons of the better class, who constitute the larger portion of railway readers, lose their accustomed taste the moment they smell the engine and present themselves to the railway librarian.&quot;

==Writers of airport novels==
Writers whose books have been described as airport novels include:
* Jeffrey Archer
* David Baldacci
* Peter Benchley
* Dan Brown
* Lee Child
* Jackie Collins
* Suzanne Collins
* Michael Crichton
* Tom Clancy
* Clive Cussler
* Robert P. Davis
* Ian Fleming
* Vince Flynn
* Frederick Forsyth
* John Grisham
* Arthur Hailey
* Thomas Harris
* E.L. James
* Stephen King
* Stieg Larsson
* Robert Ludlum
* Andy McNab
* Stephenie Meyer
* James Patterson
* Jodi Picoult
* Matthew Reilly
* Harold Robbins
* Chris Ryan
* Sidney Sheldon
* Nicholas Sparks
* Danielle Steel
* Gérard de Villiers
==In popular culture==
The animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; included a joke in the episode &quot;The Joy of Sect&quot; (airdate February 8, 1998), in which an airport bookstore is named &quot;JUST CRICHTON AND KING&quot;. Hans Moleman asks, &quot;do you have anything by Robert Ludlum?&quot; and is told by the clerk to get out.

<text>Boothby Graffoe (born James Martyn Rogers, 1962) is an English comedian, singer, songwriter and playwright. He is particularly known for his surreal sense of humour and work with Canadian band Barenaked Ladies.

==Early life==
Rogers was born in 1962 in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. For the latter part of his schooling, he attended Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, Horncastle. At the age of 18, he became a member of the redcoats at a Butlins on the south coast. He named his alter ego after an English village while driving back from a gig in the late 1980s. His family still live in the Tattershall area. He claims to be the only comedian in the world named after a Lincolnshire village.

==Stand-up comedy==
Graffoe often incorporates guitar playing into his stage act, through his oddball (and usually slightly twisted) songs, including such titles as &quot;Planet Dog&quot;, &quot;Woof&quot; and his album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Wot Italian&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;Umbrella Head Boy&quot;). Some of his song titles are still more surreal, in that they do not reflect the subject matter, such as &quot;Giraffes Don&#x27;t Play Harmonicas, So It Can&#x27;t Be a Giraffe&quot; and &quot;The Consequences of Living in a Container&quot;. He is currently accompanied by the violinist Nick Pynn, having previously toured with acoustic guitarist Antonio Forcione.

He explained his reasons for increasingly irrelevant song titles as – essentially – ways to avoid giving away the key phrases or punchlines in his songs. For instance, he renamed &quot;Umbrella Head Boy&quot; to &quot;Wot Italian&quot; after realising that audiences familiar with his work would ask him to &quot;Play Umbrella Head Boy&quot;, thus rendering the surprise element of this line in the song redundant to others.

In 2005 he participated in the Danish stand-up tour &quot;Stand-up DK|UK|OK&quot; with Danish comedians Rune Klan, Carsten Eskelund and Geo, this went on tour around Denmark and was never released on DVD.

On a tour of Scotland in February–March 2007, Graffoe announced his intention to retire from stand-up comedy and concentrate on writing for Omid Djalili. He subsequently toured as a warm-up act for Djalili and Barenaked Ladies, but has recently announced a new tour and album (&quot;Songs for Dogs&#x27; Funerals&quot;). He is a regular performer at the annual Edinburgh Festival Fringe.

Graffoe has won several awards, including the 2002 Adelaide Fringe Award for Excellence, and the Time Out Comedy Award. He has been nominated for British comedy&#x27;s prestigious Perrier Award.

==Radio==
Graffoe started his career in 1988 on BBC Radio Lincolnshire, when he presented a two-hour programme (&quot;Boothby Graffoe Live&quot;) on Friday evenings until late 1990.

He appeared regularly on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Loose Ends&quot; with Ned Sherrin.

He made the following comedy and music series for Radio 4:
* &quot;The Big Booth&quot; Radio 4 (2000–01)
* &quot;Boothby Graffoe In No Particular Order&quot; Radio 4 (2003–05)

==Television==
In 2003, Graffoe appeared on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. He also caused a stir on &quot;Opportunity Knocks&quot; during the late 1980s when he wrapped sellotape around his head for comedy effect.
In 2013 he appeared as one of a number of acts in &quot;The Alternative Comedy Experience&quot; performing at The Stand in Edinburgh and also being interviewed backstage by the curator of the show Stewart Lee.

==Music==
In 2004 Graffoe released his first album of songs with Antonio Forcione, &quot;Wot Italian?&quot;. A second disc followed in 2006, a live recording of a show in Brighton billed as &quot;Boothby Graffoe &amp; the Following People&quot;, the backing band including Nick Pynn.

Graffoe has acted as support for Canadian band Barenaked Ladies on its &quot;Last Summer on Earth&quot; 2013 tour and on four of Barenaked Ladies&#x27; UK tours: first in 2004 for the &quot;Barenaked for the Holidays&quot; tour, then in 2007 on the &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Me&quot; tour, again in 2010 on the band&#x27;s &quot;All In Good Time&quot; tour and finally on the band&#x27;s &quot;Detour de Force&quot; tour in 2022. Boothby mostly performs solo, with various members of the band joining him to play bass (Jim Creeggan), keyboard (Kevin Hearn) and drums (guitarist Ed Robertson) for some of the songs.

In January 2008, Graffoe joined the line-up for Barenaked Ladies&#x27; cruise &quot;Ships and Dip&quot;, where he performed solo and with members from BNL and other bands on board. The cruise, with a capacity of 2500, provided some North American attendees with their first experience of Graffoe and his comedy. He returned for two further &quot;Ships and Dip&quot; cruises in 2009 and 2011.

Boothby&#x27;s third album, &quot;Songs For Dogs, Funerals...&quot; was released in February 2011, featuring studio recordings of three tracks from &quot;Boothby Graffoe &amp; The Following People&quot; together with a selection of all-new tracks. Musicians appearing on the album included Nick Pynn, Theseus Gerard and Dean Friedman.

His fourth album, &quot;Bang! Is This Your Vehicle, Sir?&quot; was released on 27 February 2012. The album features guest appearances from Nick Pynn, Kevin Hearn, Omid Djalili, and members of Canadian band Thin Buckle.

A fifth album, &quot;Nomad&quot;, was released in March 2013, following a successful campaign on Kickstarter.

He has championed the work of surreal songwriter Syd Meats, often including Meats&#x27; songs, such as &quot;Far Too Serious&quot;, in his set.

In the summer of 2013, he served as the first act on Barenaked Ladies&#x27; &#x27;Last Summer On Earth Tour,&#x27; which also featured Guster and Ben Folds Five.

During 2020, he began a series of online concerts via the Zoom platform, with performances from himself and invited guests such as Robyn Hitchcock and Tim Vine.

<text>Patrocínio is a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The population is 91,449 (2020 est.) in an area of 2874 km2. The elevation is 965 m.

==Geography==
It is located in the north-center of the state near the rich industrial and agricultural region of the Triângulo Mineiro, on BR 365 between Patos de Minas and Uberlândia. It is home to the Edward Lane Bible Institute.

Patrocínio is surrounded by the following municipalities:
Coromandel to the north, 
Guimarânia, Cruzeiro da Fortaleza and Serra do Salitre to the east,
Perdizes to the south and
Iraí de Minas and Monte Carmelo to the west.

===Highway connections===
Patrocínio is connected with Uberlândia by BR-365 (154 km) and with Patos de Minas, 72 kilometers to its northeast. Other distances are to:
*Belo Horizonte: 405 km
*Araguari: 160 km.
*Perdizes: 62 km.
*Uberaba: 191 km.
BR-365, a federal road, crosses through Patrocínio. It has an extension of 866 km. linking Montes Claros, a northern city in the state of Minas Gerais to the state of Goiás, passing through the city of Uberlândia, the largest and most important city in the western part of the state. Another important highway is BR-462, which connects Perdizes with Patrocínio and has a length of 76 km.

===Statistical micro-region===
Patrocínio is also a statistical micro-region with 6 municipalities: Abadia dos Dourados, Coromandel, Cruzeiro da Fortaleza, Douradoquara, Estrela do Sul, Grupiara, Iraí de Minas, Monte Carmelo, Patrocínio, Romaria, and Serra do Salitre.
In the year 2000, its population was of 182,850 inhabitants in a total area of 12,017.00 km2. The population density (year 2000) was 5.22 inhabitants/km2.

===Hydrography===
The river network of the municipality is extensive and belongs to the basin of the Paranaíba River. The main watercourses are the rivers: Quebranzol and Santo Antonio (tributaries of the Rio Araguari); Dourados and Perdizes and Rio Espírito Santo as well as the streams (ribeirões) Salitre, Pavões, Macaúbas and Córrego do Ouro. There are also waterfalls that are little known by tourists. One example is “Cachoeiras do Lemos”, on the Ribeirão de Rita Matos, which flows into the Rio Salitre and “Cachoeira dos Borges”. Patrocínio has many small streams that allow for irrigation of the fields and for the raising of fish. The municipality has the greatest area of the region inundated by the Hydroelectric Reservoir of Nova Ponte, a total of 135.44 square kilometers. In 2006 the reservoir reached its maximum level, 815 meters above sea level.

The vegetation is cerrado, a landscape characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys. Traditionally this region was used for cattle raising, but in recent years the growing of soybeans has made encroachments causing the loss of most of the trees. Rainfall is abundant, between 1,100 and 1,600 millimeters per year, although this rainfall is concentrated in a six- to seven-month period between October and April.

===Climate===

The climate can be classified as Tropical of altitude, with yearly average temperature between 9 °C (48.2 °F) and 35 °C (95 °F). The Köppen climate classification of the region is Cwa (Tropical on high altitudes, humid/warm summer and a dry/cool winter). As a city located in the southern Hemisphere, the spring starts in September, summer in December, autumn in March, and winter in June. There are just two seasons (a hot and humid one from October to March, and a colder and drier one from April to September). The coldest month is generally July and the hottest month is January. The climate is mild throughout the year with the high altitude reducing the heat and humidity so common at lower elevations.

===Districts and villages===
Patrocínio has four districts: Salitre de Minas, São João da Serra Negra, Silvano e Santa Luzia dos Barros. The main villages are São Benedito, Tejuco, Chapadão de Ferro, Dourados, Boa Vista, Santo Antônio do Quebra Anzol, Pedros and Macaúbas.

==Economy==
The region has an economy based on cattle raising and agriculture, with dairy cattle being the most important activity. It is also the third largest producer of hogs in the country. There are also many small industries and the commercial sector is very strong.

Patrocínio has a bovine herd raised mainly for milk. According to the IBGE, there are approximately 132,000 head, distributed among 2,166 producers, responsible for the production of approximately 130,000 liters a day, which is mainly sent to the Belo Horizonte market. Part of the milk is transformed into traditional cheese and candies.

In hog production there are 14 large producers, with thousands of sows. These large ranches, together with dozens of small producers, raise approximately 5,399 sows, with an average production of 22 piglets a year, with a total of more than 125,000 head. The production is commercialized in Uberlândia and Belo Horizonte.

One of the strongest economic sectors is its industry. There are industries of ceramics, cold meats, animal feed, textiles – Minas Silk, and various warehouses to process coffee.

=== Coffee production ===

Patrocínio has become one of the most important coffee producing areas of Brazil. About 78% of the economy is connected to coffee, with the activity employing more than 30,000 people.

The cultivation of coffee began in the 1970s when strong frost decimated the large farms of Paraná and São Paulo. The region has a mild climate, good water distribution, with a large number of streams, and an annual rainfall considered ideal for coffee—about 1,600 milliliters.

The MHDI was 0.799 in 2000.

==Tourism==
Chapadão lake can be reached by BR-365 or by the Patrocínio/Cruzeiro da Fortaleza road. It is believed that Chapadão is the impact crater, which is clearly seen through Google Earth to the right of the city, being a small part of it a lake, and the large remainder farm land.

The city offers attractive plazas, where its inhabitants enjoy evening strolls. The main ones are Monsenhor Tiago, or Matriz, Santa Luzia and Honorato Borges. Its hotel infrastructure offers more than 1,000 beds in a total of 14 hotels.

==Culture==
The Casa da Cultura de Patrocínio promotes and stimulates the cultural activities in the city. It offers courses in painting, jewelry making, and rug making. It is a place where local artists can show their works. The holdings consist of 243 paintings by national and local artists. There is a collection of 843 photos of historical Patrocinio.

Museu Professor Hugo Machado da Silveira: this museum holds the municipal archives, documents, specimens of natural history, rare photos, clothes, machinery, and tools, used throughout the history of the town.

There is a rich tradition of folkloric dances called Congadas. These dance groups show a strong African-Brazilian influence. The festivities are in honor of Nossa Senhora do Rosário and São Benedito and Santa Luzia. Most of the celebrations are held between the months of August and January. This is one of the richest traditions brought by the slaves from the Congo-Angola region who lived in the region in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

==Sports infrastructure==
There is a stadium for professional football—Estádio Júlio Aguiar—and a sports center seating several thousand spectators for basketball, volleyball and shows. This sports-center belongs to the Ginásio do Patrocínio Tênis Clube. In the city there are 7 multipurpose gymnasiums in addition to several swimming pools.

==History==
The origins of the region begin with the bandeirantes, explorers during the Portuguese colonial period, who passed through on their way to the capitania of Goiás looking for gold and slaves. In 1771 the Conde de Valadares, Captain General of Minas Gerais, asked Inácio de Oliveira Campos to make explorations and excavations in the region. In 1773 in the valley of the Rio Dourados he started a ranch called Bromado dos Pavões. This small settlement became part of the Capitania of Goiás and the name was later changed to Salitre. In 1793 the first inhabitants appeared and in 1800 the first chapel was built. At this time the settlement was only an &quot;arraial&quot;, a village, and was called Senhora do Patrocínio. In 1819 it had about 40 houses made of mud (adobe bricks) and wood covered with tiles and without any plasterings. On March 9, 1839 the parish was established and the first parish priest was appointed. On April 7, 1842 Nossa Senhor do Patrocínio was declared a municipality separating thus from Araxá. In 1858 part of the municipality was dismembered to create Estrela do Sul. In 1868 another dismemberment occurred creating Patos de Minas.

The name of the city is supposedly due to a very rich landowner, who, according to the legend, upon seeing his only daughter gravely ill, asked protection from the Virgin Mary, promising the construction of a chapel if the girl was cured. When this took place he had a church built, bestowing upon it the name of Nossa Senhora do Patrocínio, which means &quot;protection&quot;.

<doc id="1080344" wikidata="Q11285118" url="?curid=1080344" title="History of the Southern United States">
<text>The history of the Southern United States spans back thousands of years to the first evidence of human occupation. The Paleo-Indians were the first peoples to inhabit the Americas and what would become the Southern United States. By the time Europeans arrived in the 15th century, the region was inhabited by the Mississippian people, well known for their mound-building cultures, building some of the largest cities of the Pre-Columbian United States. European history in the region would begin with the earliest days of the exploration. Spain, France, and especially England explored and claimed parts of the region.

Starting in the 17th century, the history of the Southern United States developed unique characteristics that came from its economy based primarily on plantation agriculture and the ubiquitous and prevalent institution of slavery. While West Africans were brought to the region as soon as English colonization began, the system was strictly formalized after Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion. Afterwards, Millions of enslaved Africans, approximately 10% of all slaves taken from Africa during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade were imported to the United States primarily but not exclusively for forced labor in the south. While the great majority of Whites did not own slaves, slavery was nevertheless the foundation of the region&#x27;s economy and social order. Southern slavery denied basic human rights to Black Americans and permeated all parts of daily life of all residents. Questions of Southern slavery directly impacted the struggle for American independence throughout the South and gave the region additional power in Congress. Almost all Southern founding fathers owned slaves including Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, though Washington did free all enslaved persons in his will.

As industrial technologies including the cotton gin made slavery even more profitable, Southern states refused to ban slavery- perpetuating the division of the United States between free and slave states. Tensions escalated as the United States expanded west ward (also retroactively causing the Southeast region to also expand to the west. However, tepid agreements including the Missouri Compromise and the Compromise of 1850 did not resolve the growing divisions the South had with the North due to slavery and the planter class&#x27;s political aspirations to control the entire country. Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election in 1860 caused South Carolina to secede which was soon followed by all other states in the region with the exception of the &#x27;border states&#x27;. The breakaway states formed the Confederate States of America – the most significant country in modern history worldwide that was founded for the purpose of promoting slavery.

Lincoln&#x27;s original goal was only to preserve the United States but to do that he had to destroy the Confederacy&#x27;s economic base: slavery. Therefore his Emancipation Proclamation brought freedom to Black slaves living in rebellious areas as soon as the US Army arrived. With a smaller economy, smaller population and (in some cases) widespread dissent among its white population the Confederate States of America was unable to carry on a protracted struggle with the national government. The 13th and 14th amendments gave freedom, citizenship and civil rights to Black Americans all across the United States. The 15th Amendment and Radical reconstruction laws gave Black men the vote, and for a few years they shared power in the South, despite violent attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Reconstruction attempted to uplift the former enslaved but this crusade was abandoned in the Compromise of 1877 and Conservative white Southerners calling themselves Redeemers took control. Even though the Ku Klux Klan was suppressed new White Supremacist organizations including the Red Shirts and the White League continued to terrorize Black Americans.

After the dissolving of a Populist movement in the 1890s that attempted to unite working-class blacks and whites Segregation and Jim Crow laws were implemented all across the region by 1900. Compared to the North, the Southern United States lost its previous political and economic power and fell behind the rest of the United States for decades. Its agricultural economy was often based on Sharecropping practices. The New Deal and World War II brought about a generation of Liberal Southerners within the Democratic Party that looked to accelerate development. The white South had a strong voice in Congress, which reorganized the cotton and tobacco markets to the advantage of Southern farmers. The government-operated Tennessee Valley Authority brought electricity and modernization to that state. Yet in exchange for economic reforms the progressive New Deal coalition carried an uneasy compromise with segregationist Democrats that the Jim Crow system would be left unaltered and the denial of basic civil rights to Black Americans would continue. Years after President Franklin D. Roosevelt died his Supreme Court appointees started dismantling segregation in the 1950s.

Black Americans and their allies resisted Jim Crow and Segregation, initially with the Great Migration and later the civil rights movement. In the face of intense opposition by racist Segregationists, Black Southerners including Martin Luther King Jr, Rosa Parks and others in a multi-racial coalition vigorously campaigned to end institutionalized racism in the American South as well as the rest of the United States. From a political and legal standpoint, many of these aims were realized by the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling on Brown v. Board and President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s (also a Southerner) reforms. Civil Rights coupled with the collapse of Black Belt agriculture has led some historians to postulate that a &#x27;New South&#x27; based on Free Trade, Globalization, and cultural diversity has emerged. Meanwhile, the South has influenced the rest of the United States in a process called Southernization. The legacy of Slavery and Jim Crow continue to impact the region- which by the 21st century was the most populous area of the United States.

==Native American civilizations until 1730==


Indigenous peoples of the Southeastern Woodlands, Southeastern cultures, or Southeast Indians are an ethnographic classification for Native Americans who have traditionally inhabited the area now part of the Southeastern United States and the northeastern border of Mexico, that share common cultural traits. This classification is a part of the Eastern Woodlands. The concept of a southeastern cultural region was developed by anthropologists, beginning with Otis Mason and Franz Boas in 1887. The boundaries of the region are defined more by shared cultural traits than by geographic distinctions.

=== Paleo-Indians ===
Around 20,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum and its aftermath the first humans likely arrived in the Southern United States. The entire region had a climate and geography that differed remarkably from current conditions. Overall the region was not only colder but much drier. On average the coastline extended at least 50 miles out into the ocean, most of which would have had a patchy maritime Boreal forest adapted to colder conditions. Meanwhile much of the interior South had a taiga forest comparable to the Canadian Yukon and the Northwest Territories. The Floridian peninsula was much larger and was mostly a temperate savanna. Further west almost the whole of Texas consisted of a tropical desert. However there were also times in prehistory where the South did not adhere to global conditions; for instance during the Younger Dryas Ice Age 11,000 years ago the region became more warm and wet whereas the rest of North America became colder.

There is debate among archeologists and historians over the exact when the Peopling of the Americas and by extension the American Southeast took place. Cactus Hill near Richmond, Virginia may be one of the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas. If proven to have been inhabited 16,000 to 20,000 years ago, it would provide supporting evidence for pre-Clovis occupation of the Americas. The first well-dated evidence of human occupation in the south United States occurs around 9500 BC with the appearance of the earliest documented Americans, who are now referred to as Paleo-Indians. Paleoindians were hunter-gatherers that roamed in bands and frequently hunted megafauna including Wooly Mammoth and Giant short-faced bears.

=== Mound builders ===


Several cultural stages, such as Archaic (–1000 BC), Poverty Point, and the Woodland ( – AD 1000), preceded what the Europeans found at the end of the 15th century the Mississippian culture.
Many pre-Columbian cultures in North America were collectively termed &quot;Mound Builders&quot;, but the term has no formal meaning. It does not refer to specific people or archaeological culture but refers to the characteristic mound earthworks that indigenous peoples erected for an extended period of more than 5,000 years.

Mound builders were originally thought to be exclusively agricultural however early mounds found in Louisiana preceded such cultures and were products of hunter-gatherers. The first mound building was an early marker of political and social complexity among the cultures in the Eastern United States. Watson Brake in Louisiana, constructed about 3500 BCE during the Middle Archaic period, is the oldest known and dated mound complex in North America. It is one of 11 mound complexes from this period found in the Lower Mississippi Valley.

The namesake cultural trait of the Mound Builders was the building of mounds and other earthworks. These burial and ceremonial structures were typically flat-topped pyramids or platform mounds, flat-topped or rounded cones, elongated ridges, and sometimes a variety of other forms. They were generally built as part of complex villages. These cultures generally had developed hierarchical societies that had an elite. These commanded hundreds or even thousands of workers to dig up tons of earth with the hand tools available, move the soil long distances, and finally, workers to create the shape with layers of soil as directed by the builders.

By the 15th century, much of the area had been home to several regional variants of the Mississippian culture for centuries, an agrarian culture that flourished in the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States. The Mississippian way of life began to develop around the 10th century in the Mississippi River Valley (for which it is named).The Mississippian culture was a complex, Native American culture that flourished in what is now the Southeastern United States from approximately 800 AD to 1500 AD. Among these cities Cahokia by St. Louis, was significant and the trading network was extensive; Etowah was a large walled city built close to the location of modern-day Atlanta. Natives had elaborate and lengthy trading routes connecting their main residential and ceremonial centers extending through the river valleys and from the East Coast to the Great Lakes, however the vast majority of mounds were concentrated in what would later become known as the Deep South. Prior to European contact, some Mississippian cultures were experiencing severe social stress as warfare increased and mound construction slowed or in other cases stopped completely, the societal decline was possibly caused by the Little Ice Age.

=== Post Contact ===

The Mississippian shatter zone describes the period from 1540 to 1730 in the southeastern part of the present United States. During that time, the interaction between European explorers and colonists transformed the Native American (Indian) cultures of that region. In 1540 dozens of chiefdoms and several paramount chiefdoms were scattered throughout the southeast. Chiefdoms featured a noble class ruling a large number of commoners and were characterized by villages and towns with large earthen mounds and complex religious practices. Some noted explorers who encountered and described the culture, by then in decline, included Pánfilo de Narváez (1528), Hernando de Soto (1540), and Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville (1699).

The chiefdoms all disappeared by 1730. The most important factor in their gradual disappearance was the chaos induced by slave raids and the enslavement of tens of thousands of Indians. Other factors included epidemics of diseases of European origin and wars among themselves and with European colonists. Indian slaves usually ended up working on plantations in the U.S. or were exported to islands in the Caribbean Sea. The city of Charleston, South Carolina was the most important slave market. The Indian population in the southeast decreased from an estimated 500,000 in 1540 to 90,000 in 1730. The chiefdoms were replaced by simpler coalescent tribes and confederacies made up of survivors and refugees from the fragmenting nations.

Native American descendants of the mound-builders include Alabama, Apalachee, Caddo, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, Guale, Hitchiti, Houma, and Seminole peoples, all of whom still reside in the South. Other peoples whose ancestral links to the Mississippian culture are less clear but were clearly in the region before the European incursion include the Catawba and the Powhatan.

==European colonization (1519–1821)==
===Spanish exploration and colonization===

Spain made frequent exploratory trips to the New World after its discovery in 1492. Rumors of natives being decorated with gold and stories of a Fountain of Youth helped hold the interest of many Spanish explorers. Juan Ponce de León was the first European to come to the South when he landed in Florida in 1513. Alonso Álvarez de Pineda was the first European to see the Mississippi river, in 1519 when he sailed twenty miles up the river from the Gulf of Mexico.

Hernando de Soto, a Spanish explorer and &quot;conquistador&quot; led the first European expedition deep into the territory, searching for gold, and a passage to China. A vast undertaking, de Soto&#x27;s North American expedition ranged across parts of the modern states of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.

Among the first European settlements in North America were Spanish settlements in Florida; the earliest was Tristán de Luna y Arellano&#x27;s failed colony in what is now Pensacola in 1559. More successful was Pedro Menéndez de Avilés&#x27;s St. Augustine, founded in 1565. Most of the Spanish left when Florida was turned over to Britain in 1763. St. Augustine remains the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in the continental United States. Spain also colonized parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas.
Spanish Texas was one of the interior provinces of the colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain from 1519 until 1821 but the first Spanish settlers arrived in 1716 They operated several missions and a presidio to maintain a buffer between Spanish territory and the Louisiana district of New France. San Antonio was founded in 1719 and became the capital and largest settlement of Spanish &quot;Tejas&quot;. The Lipan Apache menaced the newly founded colony until 1749 when the Spanish and Lipan concluded a peace treaty. Both the Spanish and Lipan were then threatened by Comanche raids until 1785 when the Spanish and Comanche negotiated a peace agreement.

===French colonization===

The first French settlement in what is now the Southern United States was Fort Caroline, located in what is now Jacksonville, Florida, in 1562. It was established as a haven for the Huguenots and was destroyed by the Spanish in 1565.

Later French arrived from the north. Having established agricultural colonies in Canada and built a fur trading network with Indians in the Great Lakes area, they began to explore the Mississippi River. The French called their territory Louisiana, in honor of their King Louis. France claimed Texas and set up several short-lived forts there, such as the one in Red River County, built in 1718. In 1817 the French pirate Jean Lafitte settled on Galveston Island; his colony there grew to more than 1,000 persons by 1818 but was abandoned in 1820. The most important French settlements were established at New Orleans and Mobile (originally called &quot;Bienville&quot;). Only a few settlers came from France directly, with others arriving from Haiti and Acadia.

==British colonial era (1585–1775)==

===First Colonies===
Just before they defeated the Spanish Armada, the English began exploring the New World. In 1585, an expedition organized by Walter Raleigh established the first English settlement in the New World, on Roanoke Island, North Carolina. The colony failed to prosper, however, and the colonists were retrieved the following year by English supply ships. In 1587, Raleigh again sent out a group of colonists to Roanoke. From this colony, the first recorded European birth in North America, a child named Virginia Dare, was reported. That group of colonists disappeared and is known as the &quot;Lost Colony&quot;. Many people theorize that they were either killed or taken in by local tribes.

Like New England, the South was originally settled by English Protestants. While the earlier attempt at colonization had failed on Roanoke Island, the English established their first permanent colony in America in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, at the mouth of the James River, which in turn empties into Chesapeake Bay.

Settlement of Chesapeake Bay was driven by a desire to obtain precious metal resources, specifically gold. The colony was technically still within Spanish territorial claims, yet far enough from most Spanish settlements to avoid colonial clashes. As the &quot;Anchor of the South&quot;, the region includes the Delmarva Peninsula and much of coastal Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia.

Early in the history of the colony, it became clear that the claims of gold deposits were vastly exaggerated. Referred to as the &quot;Starving Time&quot; of the Jamestown colony, the years from the time of landing in 1607 until 1609 were rife with famine and instability. However, Native American support, in addition to reinforcements from Britain, sustained the small colony. Due to continued political and economic instability, however, the charter of the Colony of Virginia was revoked in 1624. The primary cause of this revocation was the revelation that hundreds of settlers were dead or missing following an attack in 1622 by Native American tribes led by Opechancanough. A royal charter was established for Virginia, yet the House of Burgesses, formed in 1619, was allowed to continue as political leadership for the colony in conjunction with a royal governor.

George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, applied to Charles I for a royal charter for what was to become the Province of Maryland. After Calvert died in April 1632, the charter for &quot;Maryland Colony&quot; (in Latin &quot;Terra Mariae&quot;) was granted to his son, Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, on June 20, 1632. Some historians viewed this as compensation for his father having been stripped of his title of Secretary of State in 1625 after announcing his Roman Catholicism. Maryland soon became one of the few predominantly Catholic regions among the English colonies in North America. Maryland was also one of the key destinations where the government sent tens of thousands of English convicts punished by sentences of transportation. Such punishment persisted until the Revolutionary War.

The Province of North Carolina developed differently from South Carolina almost from the beginning. The Spanish experienced trouble colonizing North Carolina because it had a dangerous coastline, a lack of ports, and few inland rivers by which to navigate. In the 1650s and 1660s, settlers (mostly English) moved south from Virginia, in addition to runaway servants and fur trappers. They settled chiefly in the Albemarle borderlands region.

In 1665, the Crown issued a second charter to resolve territorial questions. As early as 1689, the Carolina proprietors named a separate deputy-governor for the region of the colony that lay to the north and east of Cape Fear. The division of the province into North and South became official in 1712.

===Life and Society in the 17th Century ===

A key figure in the region&#x27;s political and cultural development was William Berkeley, who served, with some interruptions, as governor of Virginia from 1645 until 1675. His desire for an elite immigration to Virginia led to the &quot;Second Sons&quot; policy, in which younger sons of English aristocrats were recruited to emigrate to Virginia. Berkeley also emphasized the headright system, the offering of large tracts of land to those arriving in the colony. This early immigration by an elite contributed to the development of an aristocratic political and social structure in the South.

English colonists, especially young indentured servants, continued to arrive along the southern Atlantic coast. Virginia became a prosperous English colony. During this period, life expectancy was often low, and indentured servants came from overpopulated European areas. With the lower price of servants compared to slaves, and the high mortality of the servants, planters often found it much more economical to use servants.

Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion was an unsuccessful armed rebellion by some Virginia settlers that took place from 1676 to 1677. It was led by Nathaniel Bacon against Governor Berkeley, after he refused Bacon&#x27;s demand to drive Native American Indians out of Virginia. Thousands of Virginians from all races and classes (including those in indentured servitude) rose up in arms against Berkeley, chasing him from Jamestown and ultimately torching the settlement. The rebellion was first suppressed by a few armed merchant ships from London whose captains sided with Berkeley and the loyalists. Government forces arrived soon after and spent several years defeating pockets of resistance and reforming the colonial government to be once more under direct Crown control.

Edmund S. Morgan&#x27;s 1975 classic, &quot;American Slavery, American Freedom: The Ordeal of Colonial Virginia&quot;, connected the threat of Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion, namely the potential for lower-class revolt, with the colony&#x27;s transition over to slavery, saying, &quot;But for those with eyes to see, there was an obvious lesson in the rebellion. Resentment of an alien race might be more powerful than resentment of an upper class. Virginians did not immediately grasp it. It would sink in as time went on.&quot;

===Rise of tobacco culture and slavery in the colonial South===

From the introduction of tobacco in 1613, its cultivation began to form the basis of the early Southern economy. Cotton did not become a mainstay until much later, after technological developments, especially the Whitney cotton gin of 1794, greatly increased the profitability of cotton cultivation. Until that point, most cotton was farmed in large plantations in the Province of Carolina, and tobacco, which could be grown profitably in farms of smaller scale, was the dominant cash crop export of the South and the Middle Colonies. In 1640, the Virginia General Court recorded the earliest documentation of lifetime slavery when it sentenced John Punch to lifetime servitude under his master Hugh Gwyn for running away.

Much of the slave trade was conducted as part of the &quot;triangular trade&quot;, a three-way exchange of slaves, rum, and sugar. Northern shippers purchased slaves using rum, made in New England from cane sugar, which was in turn grown in the Caribbean. This slave trade was generally able to fulfill labor needs in the South for the cultivation of tobacco after the decline of indentured servants. At approximately the point when tobacco labor needs began to increase, the mortality rate fell and all groups lived longer. By the late 17th century and early 18th century, slaves became economically viable sources of labor for the growing tobacco culture. Also, further south than the Mid-Atlantic, Southern settlers grew wealthy by raising and selling rice, indigo, and cotton. The plantations of South Carolina often were modeled on Caribbean plantations, albeit smaller in size.

Throughout British North America, slavery evolved in practice before it was codified into law. The Barbados slave code of 1661 marked the beginning of the legal codification of slavery. According to historian Russell Menard, &quot;Since Barbados was the first English colony to write a comprehensive slave code, its code was especially influential.&quot; The Barbados Slave Code served as the basis for the slave codes adopted in several other British American colonies, including Jamaica, Carolina (1696), Georgia, and Antigua. In other colonies where the codes are not an exact copy, such as Virginia and Maryland, the influence of the Barbados Slave Code can be traced throughout various provisions.

Slavery in the early colonial period differed in the North American colonies from that in the Caribbean, such as the British West Indies. Caribbean slaves were often worked literally to death on large sugar and rice plantations, while the American slave population had a higher life expectancy and was maintained through natural reproduction. This natural reproduction was important for the continuation of slavery after the prohibition on slave importation in 1808.

Slavery in the Colonial period was not without resistance, the most notable rebellion in the Southern Colonies was the Stono Rebellion. Portuguese speaking Angolans in the lowcountry of South Carolina, with prior military training attempted to escape to Catholic Spanish Florida. The rebellion however was intercepted by the South Carolina militia and almost all were executed, others were sold and sent to the West Indies. The rebellion profoundly changed slavery in South Carolina, the Negro Act of 1740 placed harsh regulations on slaves, including a provision that allowed any White colonist to inspect any slave for any reason. Some attempts were made to improve working conditions but these were mostly fruitless as no slave could testify against any whites. There were later revolts as well, provoked by the oppression of slavery.

===The 18th century Southern colonies===

&quot;For details on each specific colony, see Province of Georgia, Province of Maryland, Province of North Carolina, Province of South Carolina, and Colony of Virginia.&quot;

By the end of the 17th century, the number of colonists was growing. The economies of the Southern colonies were tied to agriculture. During this time the great plantations were formed by wealthy colonists who saw great opportunity in the new country. Tobacco and cotton were the main cash crops of the areas and were readily accepted by English buyers. Rice and indigo were also grown in the area and exported to Europe. The plantation owners built a vast aristocratic life and accumulated a great deal of wealth from their land. They relied on slavery as a means of working their land. On the other side of the agricultural coin were the small yeoman farmers. They did not have the capability or wealth to operate large plantations. Instead, they worked small tracts of land to feed themselves and trade locally, and grow some tobacco. They developed a political activism in response to the growing oligarchy of the plantation owners. Many politicians from this era were yeoman farmers speaking out to protect their rights as free men.

Charleston became a booming trade town for the southern colonies. The abundance of pine trees in the area provided raw materials for shipyards to develop, and the harbor provided a safe port for English ships bringing in imported goods. The colonists exported tobacco, indigo and rice and imported tea, sugar, and slaves.

After the late 17th century, the economies of the North and the South began to diverge, especially in coastal areas. The Southern emphasis on export production contrasted with the Northern emphasis on food production.

Further south British General James Oglethorpe envisioned Georgia as a colony which would serve as a haven for English subjects who had been imprisoned for debt and &quot;the worthy poor&quot;. General Oglethorpe imposed very strict laws that many colonists disagreed with, such as the banning of alcoholic beverages. He disagreed with slavery and thought a system of smallholdings more appropriate than the large plantations common in the colonies just to the north. However, land grants were not as large as most colonists would have preferred.

Another reason for the founding of the colony was as a buffer state and a &quot;garrison province&quot; which would defend the southern British colonies from Spanish Florida. Oglethorpe imagined a province populated by &quot;sturdy farmers&quot; who could guard the border; because of this, the colony&#x27;s charter prohibited slavery. The ban on slavery was lifted by 1751 and the colony became a royal colony by 1752.

By the mid-18th century, the colonies of Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia had been established. In the upper colonies, that is, Maryland, Virginia, and portions of North Carolina, the tobacco culture prevailed. However, in the lower colonies of South Carolina and Georgia, cultivation focused more on cotton and rice.

==American Revolution (1775–1789)==


===Revolutionary War===
Some southern colonies, led by Virginia, gave support for the Patriot cause in solidarity with Massachusetts. Georgia, the newest, smallest, most exposed and militarily most vulnerable colony, hesitated briefly before joining the other 12 colonies in Congress. South Carolina meanwhile had the largest loyalist support of any state, usually from the backcountry or &#x27;upland&#x27;. As soon as news arrived of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, Patriot forces took control of every colony, using secret committees that had been organized in the previous two years. After the combat began, Governor Dunmore of Virginia was forced to flee to a British warship off the coast. In late 1775 he issued a proclamation offering freedom to slaves who escaped from Patriot owners and volunteer to fight for the British Army. Over 1,000 volunteered and served in British uniforms, chiefly in the Ethiopian Regiment. However, they were defeated in the Battle of Great Bridge, and most of them died of disease. The Royal Navy took Dunmore and other officials home in August 1776, and also carried to freedom 300 surviving former slaves.

Southern politicians were at the forefront in the early Continental Congresses and the writing of The Declaration of Independence. Thomas Jefferson wrote the first draft; Jefferson&#x27;s draft condemned the United Kingdom for bringing slaves to North America despite being a slaveowner himself. Other delegates insisted on removal of any mention of slavery from the document. South Carolina&#x27;s delegation ensured the continuance of the institution of slavery. Delegate Thomas Lynch threatened to break away from the country if congress entertained any discussion on slavery, indicating that for South Carolina preserving slavery was more important than American nationhood. Meanwhile Edward Rutledge tried unsuccessfully to expel black soldiers from the Continental Army
After their defeat at Saratoga in 1777 and the entry of the French into the American Revolutionary War, the British turned their attention to the South. With fewer regular troops at their disposal, the British commanders developed a &quot;southern strategy&quot; that relied heavily on volunteer soldiers and militia from the Loyalist element.

Beginning in late December 1778, the British captured Savannah and controlled the Georgia coastline. In 1780 they seized Charleston, capturing a large American army. A significant victory at the Battle of Camden meant that royal forces soon controlled most of Georgia and South Carolina. The British set up a network of forts inland, expecting the Loyalists would rally to the flag. Far too few Loyalists turned out however, and the British had to fight their way north into North Carolina and Virginia with a severely weakened army. Behind them most of the territory they had already captured dissolved into a chaotic guerrilla war, fought predominantly between bands of Loyalist and Patriot militia, with the Patriots retaking the areas the British had previously gained. In January 1781, the Battle of Cowpens near Cowpens, South Carolina, was a turning point in the American reconquest of South Carolina from the British.

The British army marched to Yorktown, Virginia, where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet. The fleet showed up but so did a larger French fleet, so the British fleet after the Battle of the Chesapeake returned to New York for reinforcements, leaving General Cornwallis trapped by the much larger American and French armies under Washington. He surrendered. The most prominent Loyalists, especially those who joined Loyalist regiments, were evacuated by the Royal Navy back to England, Canada, or other British colonies; they brought their slaves along, but lost their land. The other Loyalists who remained in the southern states became American citizens.

===The South influences the new nation===
After the upheaval of the American Revolution effectively came to an end at the Siege of Yorktown (1781), the South became a major political force in the development of the United States. With the ratification of the Articles of Confederation, the South found political stability and a minimum of federal interference in state affairs. However, with this stability came a weakness in its design, and the inability of the Confederation to maintain economic viability eventually forced the creation of the United States Constitution in Philadelphia in 1787. Importantly, Southerners of 1861 often believed their secessionist efforts and the Civil War paralleled the American Revolution, as a military and ideological &quot;replay&quot; of the latter.

Southern leaders were able to protect their sectional interests during the Constitutional Convention of 1787, preventing the insertion of any explicit anti-slavery position in the Constitution. Moreover, they were able to force the inclusion of the &quot;fugitive slave clause&quot; and the &quot;Three-Fifths Compromise&quot;. Nevertheless, Congress retained the power to regulate the slave trade. Twenty years after the ratification of the Constitution, the law-making body prohibited the importation of slaves, effective January 1, 1808. While North and South were able to find common ground to gain the benefits of a strong Union, the unity achieved in the Constitution masked deeply rooted differences in economic and political interests. After the 1787 convention, two discrete understandings of American republicanism emerged.

In the South, agrarian laissez-faire formed the basis of political culture. Led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, this agrarian position is characterized by the epitaph on the grave of Jefferson. While including his &quot;condition bettering&quot; roles in the foundation of the University of Virginia, and the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, absent from the epitaph was his role as President of the United States. The development of Southern political thought thus focused on the ideal of the yeoman farmer; i.e., those who are tied to the land also have a vested interest in the stability and survival of the government.

The Revolution provided a shock to slavery in the South and other regions of the new country. Thousands of slaves took advantage of wartime disruption to find their own freedom, catalyzed by the British Governor Dunmore of Virginia&#x27;s promise of freedom for service. Many others were removed by Loyalist owners and became slaves elsewhere in the British Empire. Between 1770 and 1790, there was a sharp decline in the percentage of blacks – from 61% to 44% in South Carolina and from 45% to 36% in Georgia. In addition, some slaveholders were inspired to free their slaves after the Revolution. They were moved by the principles of the Revolution, along with Quaker and Methodist preachers who worked to encourage slaveholders to free their slaves. Planters such as George Washington often freed slaves by their wills. In the Upper South, more than 10% of all blacks were free by 1810, a significant expansion from pre-war proportions of less than 1% free.

==Antebellum era (1789–1861)==


From a cultural and social standpoint, the &quot;Old South&quot; is used to describe the rural, agriculturally-based, slavery-reliant economy and society in the Antebellum South, prior to the American Civil War (1861–65), in contrast to the &quot;New South&quot; of the post-Reconstruction Era.

The social structure of the Old South was made an important research topic for scholars by Ulrich Bonnell Phillips in the early 20th century. The romanticized image of the &quot;Old South&quot; tells of slavery&#x27;s plantations, as famously typified in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, a blockbuster 1936 novel and its adaptation in a 1939 Hollywood film, along with other popular media portrayals. Historians in recent decades have paid much more attention to the enslaved people of the South and the world they made for themselves. To a lesser extent, they have also studied the poor subsistence farmers, known as &quot;yeoman farmers&quot;, who owned little property and no slaves.

There were almost 700,000 enslaved persons in the U.S. in 1790, which equated to approximately 18 percent of the total population, or roughly one in every six people. This had persisted through the 17th and 18th centuries, but the invention of the cotton gin by Eli Whitney in the 1790s made slavery even more profitable and caused a larger plantation system developed. In the 15 years between the invention of the cotton gin and the passage of the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, an increase in the slave trade occurred, furthering the slave system in the United States.

As the country expanded its territory and economy west, New Orleans was the third largest American city in population by 1840. The success of the city was based on the growth of international trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety of jobs that attracted more immigrants than other areas of the South. Because of lack of investment, however, construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North. People relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation.

Jacksonian democracy was a 19th-century political philosophy in the United States that expanded suffrage to most white men over the age of 21 and restructured a number of federal institutions. Originating with the seventh U.S. president, Andrew Jackson and his supporters, it became the nation&#x27;s dominant political worldview for a generation. The term itself was in active use by the 1830s.

This era, called the Jacksonian Era or Second Party System by historians and political scientists, lasted roughly from Jackson&#x27;s 1828 election as president until slavery became the dominant issue with the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854 and the political repercussions of the American Civil War dramatically reshaped American politics. It emerged when the long-dominant Democratic-Republican Party became factionalized around the 1824 United States presidential election. Jackson&#x27;s supporters began to form the modern Democratic Party.

Broadly speaking, the era was characterized by a democratic spirit. It built upon Jackson&#x27;s equal political policy, subsequent to ending what he termed a monopoly of government by elites. Even before the Jacksonian era began, suffrage had been extended to a majority of white male adult citizens, a result which the Jacksonians celebrated. Jacksonian democracy also promoted the strength of the presidency and the executive branch at the expense of the United States Congress, while also seeking to broaden the public&#x27;s participation in government. The Jacksonians demanded elected, not appointed, judges and rewrote many state constitutions to reflect the new values. In national terms, they favored geographical expansionism, justifying it in terms of manifest destiny. There was usually a consensus among both Jacksonians and Whigs that battles over slavery should be avoided.

===Indian removal ===
In 1830, Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the president to negotiate treaties that exchanged Native American tribal lands in the eastern states for lands west of the Mississippi River. Its goal was primarily to remove Native Americans, including the Five Civilized Tribes, from the American Southeast – they occupied land that settlers wanted.

Jacksonian Democrats demanded the forcible removal of native populations who refused to acknowledge state laws to reservations in the West. Whigs and religious leaders opposed the move as inhumane. Thousands of deaths resulted from the relocations, as seen in the Cherokee Trail of Tears. The Trail of Tears resulted in approximately 2,000–8,000 of the 16,543 relocated Cherokee perishing along the way. Many of the Seminole Indians in Florida refused to move west; they fought the Army for years in the Seminole Wars. The Civilized Tribes were permitted to bring 4,000 black slaves with them, some freedmen also went west with the tribes.

===Antebellum slavery===
In the North, slaves were mostly household servants or farm laborers, every Northern state abolished slavery by 1804. The Continental Congress abolished slavery in the Northwest Territory and its future states. Therefore, by 1804 the Mason–Dixon line (the border between free Pennsylvania and slave Maryland) became the dividing mark between &quot;free&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; states.

About a quarter of white Southern families were slave owners, with most being independent yeoman farmers. Nevertheless, the slave system represented the basis of the Southern social and economic structure, and thus even the majority of non-slave-owners opposed any suggestions for terminating that system, whether through outright abolition or case-by-case manumission.

The southern plantation economy was dependent on foreign trade, and the success of this trade helps explain why southern elites and some white yeomen were so violently opposed to abolition. There is considerable debate among scholars about whether or not the slaveholding South was a capitalist society and economy.

The replacement for the importation of slaves from abroad was increased domestic production. Virginia and Maryland had little new agricultural development, and their need for slaves was mostly for replacements for decedents. Normal reproduction more than supplied these: Virginia and Maryland had surpluses of slaves. Their tobacco farms were &quot;worn out&quot; and the climate was not suitable for cotton or sugar cane. The surplus was even greater because slaves were encouraged to reproduce (though they could not marry). The pro-slavery Virginian Thomas Roderick Dew wrote in 1832 that Virginia was a &quot;negro-raising state&quot;; i.e. Virginia &quot;produced&quot; slaves. According to him, in 1832 Virginia exported &quot;upwards of 6,000 slaves&quot; per year, &quot;a source of wealth to Virginia&quot;. A newspaper from 1836 gives the figure as 40,000, earning for Virginia an estimated $24,000,000 per year. Demand for slaves was the strongest in what was then the southwest of the country: Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and, later, Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri. Here there was abundant land suitable for plantation agriculture, which young men with some capital established. This was expansion of the white, monied population: younger men seeking their fortune.

The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the &quot;Second Middle Passage&quot; because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the Middle Passage (the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America). These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship. Characterizing it as the &quot;central event&quot; in the life of a slave between the American Revolution and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that, whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, &quot;the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free&quot;. Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families that had been in the United States for many generations.

In the 19th century, some proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. At that time, it was feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery. On April 22, 1820, Thomas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, wrote in a letter to John Holmes, that with slavery,

By contrast from Thomas Jefferson John C. Calhoun, in a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, declared that slavery was &quot;instead of an evil, a gooda positive good&quot;. Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this respect, he concluded, &quot;will become more and more manifest, if left undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in wealth and numbers&quot;.

Historians have begun to reflect on the impact of slavery on the entire society of the Antebellum south. Thomas Sowell draws the following conclusion regarding the macroeconomic value of slavery:

In short, even though some individual slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that is very different from saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced than it would have been in the absence of slavery. What this means is that, whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods, millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the... aggrandizement of slaveowners.

===Nullification crisis, political representation, and rising sectionalism===

Although slavery had yet to become the most prominent political issue, states&#x27; rights would surface periodically in the early antebellum period, especially within the South. The election of Federalist member John Adams in the 1796 presidential election came in tandem with escalating tensions with France. In 1798, the XYZ Affair brought these tensions to the fore, and Adams became concerned about French power in America, fearing internal sabotage and malcontent that could be brought on by French agents. In response to these developments and to repeated attacks on Adams and the Federalists by Democratic-Republican publishers, Congress enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts. Enforcement of the acts resulted in the jailing of &quot;seditious&quot; Democratic-Republican editors throughout the North and South, and prompted the adoption of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions of 1798 (authored by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison), by the legislatures of those states.

Thirty years later, during the Nullification Crisis, the &quot;Principles of &#x27;98&quot; embodied in these resolutions were cited by leaders in South Carolina as a justification for state legislatures&#x27; asserting the power to nullify, or prevent the local application of, acts of the federal Congress that they deemed unconstitutional. The Nullification Crisis arose as a result of the Tariff of 1828, a set of high taxes on imports of manufactures, enacted by Congress as a protectionist measure to foster the development of domestic industry, primarily in the North. In 1832, the legislature of South Carolina nullified the entire &quot;Tariff of Abominations&quot;, as the Tariff of 1828 was known in the South, prompting a stand-off between the state and federal government. On May 1, 1833, President Andrew Jackson wrote, &quot;the tariff was only a pretext, and disunion and southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro, or slavery question.&quot; Although the crisis was resolved through a combination of the actions of the president, Congressional reduction of the tariff, and the Force Bill, it had lasting importance for the later development of secessionist thought. An additional factor that led to Southern sectionalism was the proliferation of cultural and literary magazines such as the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; and &quot;DeBow&#x27;s Review&quot;.

===Sectional parity and issue of slavery in new territories===

The primary issue feeding sectionalism was slavery, and especially the issue of whether to permit slavery in western territories seeking admission to the Union as states. In the early 19th century, as the cotton boom took hold, slavery became more economically viable on a large scale, and more Northerners began to perceive it as an economic threat, even if they remained indifferent to its moral dimension. While relatively few Northerners favored outright abolition, many more opposed the expansion of slavery to new territories, as in their view the availability of slaves lowered wages for free labor.

At the same time, Southerners increasingly perceived the economic and population growth of the North as threatening to their interests. For several decades after the Union was formed, as new states were admitted, North and South were able to finesse their sectional differences and maintain political balance by agreeing to admit &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;free&quot; states in equal numbers. By means of this compromise approach, the balance of power in the Senate could be extended indefinitely. The House of Representatives, however, was a different matter. As the North industrialized and its population grew, aided by a major influx of European immigrants, the Northern majority in the House of Representatives also grew, making Southern political leaders increasingly uncomfortable. Southerners became concerned that they would soon find themselves at the mercy of a federal government in which they no longer had sufficient representation to protect their interests. By the late 1840s, Senator Jefferson Davis from Mississippi stated that the new Northern majority in the Congress would make the government of the United States &quot;an engine of Northern aggrandizement&quot; and that Northern leaders had an agenda to &quot;promote the industry of the United States at the expense of the people of the South.&quot;
After the Mexican–American War, many Northerners became alarmed by new territory now being added on the Southern side of the free-slave boundary, the slavery-in-the-territories issue heated up dramatically. After a four-year sectional conflict, the Compromise of 1850 narrowly averted civil war with a complex deal in which California was admitted as a free state, including Southern California, thus preventing a separate slave territory there, while slavery was allowed in the New Mexico and Utah territories and a stronger Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was passed, requiring all citizens to assist in recapturing runaway slaves wherever found. Four years later, the peace bought with successive compromises finally came to an end. In the Kansas–Nebraska Act, Congress left the issue of slavery to a vote in each territory, thereby provoking a breakdown of law and order as rival groups of pro- and anti-slavery immigrants competed to populate the newly settled region.

===Election of 1860, secession, and Lincoln&#x27;s response===
For many Southerners, the last straws were the raid on Harper&#x27;s Ferry in 1859 by abolitionist John Brown, immediately followed by a Northern Republican victory in the presidential election of 1860. Notably, South Carolina had no popular vote. Republican Abraham Lincoln was elected president in a hotly contested four way race. In Southern States local leaders ensured that Lincoln was blocked from the ballot, instead most voters made a choice between hard line Breckingridge and Bell who advocated preservation of the union, slavery was the prevailing subject of the election. Beckingbridge argued that Southern independence was desirable to protect slavery if Lincoln was elected; Bell argued that the constitution protected slavery so that secession was unnecessary.

Members of the South Carolina legislature had previously sworn to secede from the Union if Lincoln was elected, and the state declared its secession on December 20, 1860. South Carolina&#x27;s declaration of secession mentioned slavery 17 times and justifying South Carolina&#x27;s independence in lieu of looming property rights violations (the right to own slaves) by the national government.
In January and February, six other cotton states of the Deep South followed suit: Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. The other eight slave states postponed a decision, but the seven formed a new government in Montgomery, Alabama, in February: the Confederate States of America. Throughout the South, Confederates seized federal arsenals and forts, without resistance, and forced the surrender of all U.S. forces in Texas. The sitting president, James Buchanan, believed he had no constitutional power to act, and in the four months between Lincoln&#x27;s election and his inauguration, the South strengthened its military position.

In Washington, proposals for compromise and reunion went nowhere, as the Confederates demanded complete, total, permanent independence. When Lincoln dispatched a supply ship to federal-held Fort Sumter, in South Carolina, the Confederate government ordered an attack on the fort, which surrendered on April 13. President Lincoln called upon the states to supply 75,000 troops to serve for ninety days to recover federal property, and, forced to choose sides, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina promptly voted to secede. Kentucky declared its neutrality.

==Confederate States (1861–1865)==


The seceded states, joined as the Confederate States of America sought to consolidate control over border southern states including Kentucky and Missouri, The Confederate government also envisioned westward expansion through its Arizona territory- one goal being to extend the CSA to the Pacific Coast. An invasion of Spanish Cuba was discussed and remained a possibility if Confederate independence had been achieved. 
After secession, no compromise was possible, because the Confederacy insisted on its independence and the Lincoln Administration refused to meet with President Davis&#x27;s commissioners. Lincoln ordered that a Navy fleet of warships and troop transports be sent to Charleston Harbor to reinforce and resupply Fort Sumter. Just before the fleet was about to enter the harbor, Confederates unleashed a massive bombardment and forced the Federal garrison holed up in the fort to surrender. The incident, prompted President Lincoln to proclaim that United States forces had been attacked and called for mobilizations to restore Government control in the seceded states. In response the Confederate military strategy was to hold its territory together, gain worldwide recognition, and inflict so much punishment on invaders that the Northerners would tire of an expensive war and negotiate a peace treaty that would recognize the independence of the CSA. Two Confederate counter-offensives into Maryland and southern Pennsylvania failed to influence Federal elections as hoped. The victory of Lincoln and his party in the 1864 elections made the Union&#x27;s military victory only a matter of time.

Both sides wanted the border southern states, with the Confederacy controlling half of Kentucky and the southern portion of Missouri early in the war, but the Union military forces took control of all of them in 1861–1862. Union victories in western Virginia allowed a Unionist government based in Wheeling to take control of western Virginia and, with Washington&#x27;s approval, create the new state of West Virginia. The Confederacy did recruit troops in the border states, but the enormous advantage of controlling them went to the Union.

The Union naval blockade, starting in May 1861, reduced exports by 95%; only small, fast blockade runners—mostly owned and operated by British interests—could get through. The South&#x27;s vast cotton crops became nearly worthless.

In 1861 the rebels assumed that &quot;King Cotton&quot; was so powerful that the threat of losing their supplies would induce Britain and France to enter the war as allies, and thereby frustrate Union efforts. Confederate leaders were ignorant of European conditions; Britain depended on the Union for its food supply, and would not benefit from an extremely expensive major war with the U.S. The Confederacy moved its capital from a defensible location in remote Montgomery, Alabama, to the more cosmopolitan city of Richmond, Virginia, only from Washington. Richmond had the heritage and facilities to match those of Washington, but its proximity to the Union forced the CSA to spend most of its war-making capability to defend Richmond.

===Politics and Government===

The strength of the Confederacy included an unusually strong officer corps—about a third of the officers of the U.S. Army had resigned and joined. But the political leadership was not very effective. A classic interpretation is that the Confederacy &quot;died of states&#x27; rights&quot;, as governors of Texas, Georgia, and North Carolina refused Richmond&#x27;s request for troops.

The Confederate government was formed to explicitly protect the institution of slavery as stated by Vice President Alexander H. Stephens and thus enshrined slavery in its constitution.
The U.S. Constitution has a clause that states &quot;No bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed,&quot; the Confederate Constitution added onto this a phrase that explicitly protected slavery.
The Confederacy decided not to have political parties. There was a strong sense that parties were divisive and would weaken the war effort. Historians, however, agree that the lack of parties weakened the political system. Instead of having a viable alternative to the current system, as expressed by a rival party, the people could only grumble and complain and lose faith.

Historians disparage the effectiveness of President Jefferson Davis, with a consensus holding that he was much less effective than Abraham Lincoln. As a former Army officer, senator, and Secretary of War, he possessed the stature and experience to be president, but certain character defects undercut his performance. He played favorites and was imperious, frosty, and quarrelsome. By dispensing with parties, he lost the chance to build a grass roots network that would provide critically needed support in dark hours. Instead, he took the brunt of the blame for all difficulties and disasters. Davis was animated by a profound vision of a powerful, opulent new nation, the Confederate States of America, premised on the right of its white citizens to self-government. However, in dramatic contrast to Lincoln, he was never able to articulate that vision or provide a coherent strategy to fight the war. He neglected the civilian needs of the Confederacy while spending too much time meddling in military details. Davis&#x27;s meddling in military strategy proved counterproductive. His explicit orders that Vicksburg be held no matter what sabotaged the only feasible defense and led directly to the fall of the city in 1863.

===Abolition of slavery===

Across the South, widespread rumors alarmed the whites by predicting the slaves were planning some sort of insurrection. Patrols were stepped up. The slaves did become increasingly independent, and resistant to punishment, but historians agree there were no insurrections. In the invaded areas, insubordination was more the norm than was loyalty to the old master; Bell Wiley says, &quot;It was not disloyalty, but the lure of freedom.&quot; Many slaves became spies for the North, and large numbers ran away to federal lines.

By 1862, most Northern leaders realized that the mainstay of Southern secession, slavery, had to be attacked head-on. All the border states rejected President Lincoln&#x27;s proposal for compensated emancipation. However, by 1865 all had begun the abolition of slavery, except Kentucky and Delaware. The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from &quot;slave&quot; to &quot;free&quot;. It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union Army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves. The owners were never compensated. Nor were the slaves themselves. Many of the freedmen remained on the same plantation, others crowded into refugee camps operated by the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. The Bureau provided food, housing, clothing, medical care, church services, some schooling, legal support, and arranged for labor contracts.

Historian Leon Litwack has noted, &quot;Neither white nor black Southerners were unaffected by the physical and emotional demands of the war. Scarcities of food and clothing, for example, imposed hardships on both races.&quot; Conditions were worse for blacks. Late in the war and soon after large numbers of blacks moved away from the plantation. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau refugee camps saw infectious disease such as smallpox reach epidemic proportions. Jim Downs states:
:Disease and sickness had more devastating and fatal effects on emancipated slaves than on soldiers, since ex-slaves often lacked the basic necessities to survive. Emancipation liberated bonds people from slavery, but they often lacked clean clothing, adequate shelter, proper food, and access to medicine in their escape toward Union lines. Many free slaves died once they secured refuge behind union camps.

===Railroads===
The Union had a 3–1 superiority in railroad mileage and (even more important) an overwhelming advantage in engineers and mechanics in the rolling mills, machine shops, factories, roundhouses and repair yards that produced and maintained rails, bridging equipage, locomotives, rolling stock, signaling gear, and telegraph equipment. In peacetime the South imported all its railroad gear from the North; the Union blockade completely cut off such imports. The lines in the South were mostly designed for short hauls, as from cotton areas to river or ocean ports; they were not designed for trips of more than 100 miles or so, and such trips involved numerous changes of trains and layovers. The South&#x27;s of track comprised enough of a railroad system to handle essential military traffic along some internal lines, assuming it could be defended and maintained. As the system deteriorated because of worn out equipment, accidents and sabotage, the South was unable to construct or even repair new locomotives, cars, signals or track. Little new equipment ever arrived, although rails in remote areas such as Florida were removed and put to more efficient use in the war zones. Realizing their enemy&#x27;s dilemma, Union cavalry raids routinely destroyed locomotives, cars, rails, roundhouses, trestles, bridges, and telegraph wires. By the end of the war, the southern railroad system was totally ruined. Meanwhile, the Union army rebuilt rail lines to supply its forces. A Union railroad through hostile territory, as from Nashville to Atlanta in 1864, was an essential but fragile lifeline—it took a whole army to guard it, because each foot of track had to be secure. Large numbers of Union soldiers throughout the war were assigned to guard duty and, while always ready for action, seldom saw any fighting.

===Southern Unionists===

Among Southern White populations and lawmakers there was never universal support for separation from the National Government, particularly in the upper south. Virginia&#x27;s state legislature at first voted by 2/3 to remain in the United States, after the fall of Fort Sumpter 36% of the delegates again voted against secession. Meanwhile North Carolina voted by popular referendum to remain in the United States; when North Carolina later seceded anyway the governor would not permit a second referendum to be held. Tennessee had strong unionist sentiment in its eastern Appalachian counties. Further west Kentucky&#x27;s Pro Confederate Governor declared neutrality because he believed the majority of the white population would refuse secession.

Southerners who were against the Confederate cause during the Civil War were known as Southern Unionists. They were also known as Union Loyalists or Lincoln&#x27;s Loyalists. Within the eleven Confederate states, states such as Tennessee (especially East Tennessee), Virginia (which included West Virginia at the time), and North Carolina were home to the largest populations of Unionists. Many areas of Southern Appalachia harbored pro-Union sentiment as well. As many as 100,000 men living in states under Confederate control would serve in the Union Army or pro-Union guerrilla groups. Every State had an organized Unionist army with the exception of South Carolina. Although Southern Unionists came from all classes, most differed socially, culturally, and economically from the region&#x27;s dominant pre-war planter class. As a reward for loyalty to the capital and with the protection of Union soldiers, West Virginia was granted its independence from the rest of Virginia by congress in 1863. Cities and areas farther away from Eastern Virginia were more supportive of statehood. In Mississippi a county broke away from the Confederacy and freed the slaves, becoming the Free State of Jones.

In Texas, local officials harassed and murdered Unionists and Germans during the Civil War. In Cooke County, Texas, 150 suspected Unionists were arrested; 25 were lynched without trial and 40 more were hanged after a summary trial. Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter leaving to Mexico. Confederate officials would attempt to hunt down and kill potential draftees who had gone into hiding.

A study of Southern Unionists in Alabama who continued to support the Union during the war found that they were typically &quot;old fashioned&quot; or &quot;Jackson&quot; conservative Democrats, or former Whigs, who viewed the federal government as worthy of defending because it had provided economic and political security. A section of slaveholding unionists believed preserving the union was more important than protecting slavery. The Southern ideals of honor, family, and duty were as important to Unionists as to their pro-secession neighbors. They believed, however, that rebelling against the United States, which many of their ancestors had fought for in 1776 and 1812, was the unmanly and dishonorable act.

===Indian Territory===

Confederate supporters in the trans-Mississippi west also claimed portions of the Indian Territory after the United States evacuated the federal forts and installations. These were the same Native American Nations that had been subject to removal thirty years before. Over half of the American Indian troops participating in the Civil War from the Indian Territory supported the Confederacy; troops and one general were enlisted from each tribe. On July 12, 1861, the Confederate government signed a treaty with both the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indian nations. After several battles, Union armies took control of the territory.

The Indian Territory never formally joined the Confederacy, but it did receive representation in the Confederate Congress. Many Indians from the Territory were integrated into regular Confederate Army units. After 1863, the tribal governments sent representatives to the Confederate Congress: Elias Cornelius Boudinot representing the Cherokee and Samuel Benton Callahan representing the Seminole and Creek. The Cherokee Nation aligned with the Confederacy. They practiced and supported slavery, opposed abolition, and feared their lands would be seized by the Union. After the war, the Indian territory was disestablished, their black slaves were freed, and the tribes lost some of their lands.

===Sherman&#x27;s March===
By 1864, the top Union generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman realized the weakest point of the Confederate armies was the decrepitude of the southern infrastructure, so they escalated efforts to wear it down. Cavalry raids were the favorite device, with instructions to ruin railroads and bridges. Sherman&#x27;s insight was deeper. He focused on the trust the rebels had in their Confederacy as a living nation, and he set out to destroy that trust; he predicted his raid would &quot;demonstrate the vulnerability of the South, and make its inhabitants feel that war and individual ruin are synonymous terms.&quot; Sherman&#x27;s &quot;March to the Sea&quot; from Atlanta to Savannah in the fall of 1864 burned and ruined every part of the industrial, commercial, transportation and agricultural infrastructure it touched, but the actual damage was confined to a swath of territory totaling about 15% of Georgia. Sherman struck at Georgia in October, just after the harvest, when the food supplies for the next year had been gathered and were exposed to destruction. In early 1865, Sherman&#x27;s army moved north through the Carolinas in a campaign even more devastating than the march through Georgia. More telling than the twisted rails, smoldering main streets, dead cattle, burning barns and ransacked houses was the bitter realization among civilians and soldiers throughout the remaining Confederacy that if they persisted, sooner or later their homes and communities would receive the same treatment. According to a 2022 &quot;American Economic Journal&quot; study which sought to measure the medium- and long-term economic impact of Sherman&#x27;s March, &quot;the capital destruction induced by the March led to a large contraction in agricultural investment, farming asset prices, and manufacturing activity. Elements of the decline in agriculture persisted through 1920&quot;.

The March attracted a huge number of refugees, to whom Sherman assigned land with his Special Field Orders No. 15. These orders have been depicted in popular culture as the origin of the &quot;40 acres and a mule&quot; promise. Slaves&#x27; opinions varied concerning the actions of Sherman and his army. Some who welcomed him as a liberator chose to follow his armies. Jacqueline Campbell has written, on the other hand, that some slaves looked upon the Union army&#x27;s ransacking and invasive actions with disdain. They often felt betrayed, as they &quot;suffered along with their owners, complicating their decision of whether to flee with or from Union troops&quot;, although that is now seen as a post synopsis of Confederate nationalism. A Confederate officer estimated that 10,000 liberated slaves followed Sherman&#x27;s army, and hundreds died of &quot;hunger, disease, or exposure&quot; along the way.

===Material ruin and human losses===
The Conclusion of the American Civil War and Reconstruction played out against a backdrop of a once prosperous economy that lay in ruins. According to Hesseltine (1936),

The soldiers who returned from the war found widespread desolation at their homes. In the Shenandoah Valley, blackened chimneys stood sentinel over cold ash heaps which once were houses. Throughout the South, fences were down, weeds had overrun the fields, windows were broken, live stock had disappeared. The assessed valuation of property declined from 30 to 60 percent in the decade after 1860. . . . In Mobile, business was stagnant; Chattanooga and Nashville were ruined; and Atlanta&#x27;s industrial sections were in ashes.

Estimate of Confederate losses were 94,000 killed in battle, 164,000 who died of disease, and 26,000 who died in Union prisons. Estimate of Union losses were 110,000 killed in battle, 225,000 who died of disease, and 30,000 who died in Confederate prisons. Northern military deaths were greater than Southern military deaths in absolute numbers, but were two-thirds smaller in terms of proportion of population affected.

The number of civilian deaths during the war is unknown, but was highest among refugees and former slaves. Most of the war was fought in Virginia and Tennessee, but every Confederate state was affected, as well as the border states of Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Indian Territory; Pennsylvania was the only northerner state to be the scene of major action, during the Gettysburg Campaign. In the Confederacy there was little military action in Texas and Florida. Of 645 counties in nine Confederate states (excluding Texas and Florida), there was Union military action in 56% of them, containing 63% of the whites and 64% of the slaves in 1860; however, by the time the action took place some people had fled to safer areas, so the exact population exposed to war is unknown.

The Confederacy in 1861 had 297 towns and cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point occupied by Union forces. Ten were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 8,100 and 37,900, respectively), plus Charleston, much of which was destroyed in an accidental fire in 1861. These eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated their population when they were invaded. The number of people who lived in the destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy&#x27;s population. In addition, 45 courthouses were burned (out of 830). The South&#x27;s agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million; by 1870, there was 40% less, or $48 million worth. Many old tools had broken through heavy use and could not be replaced; even repairs were difficult.

The economic calamity suffered by the South during had widespread implications. Except for land, most assets and investments had vanished with slavery, but debts were left behind. Worst of all were the human deaths and amputations. Most farms were intact but most had lost their horses, mules and cattle; fences and barns were in disrepair. Prices for cotton had plunged. The rebuilding would take years and require outside investment because the devastation was so thorough. One historian has summarized the collapse of the transportation infrastructure needed for economic recovery.

One of the greatest calamities which confronted Southerners was the havoc wrought on the transportation system. Roads were impassable or nonexistent, and bridges were destroyed or washed away. The important river traffic was at a standstill: levees were broken, channels were blocked, the few steamboats which had not been captured or destroyed were in a state of disrepair, wharves had decayed or were missing, and trained personnel were dead or dispersed. Horses, mules, oxen, carriages, wagons, and carts had nearly all fallen prey at one time or another to the contending armies. The railroads were paralyzed, with most of the companies bankrupt. These lines had been the special target of the enemy. On one stretch of 114 miles in Alabama, every bridge and trestle was destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water-tanks gone, ditches filled up, and tracks grown up in weeds and bushes. ... Communication centers like Columbia and Atlanta were in ruins; shops and foundries were wrecked or in disrepair. Even those areas bypassed by battle had been pirated for equipment needed on the battlefront, and the wear and tear of wartime usage without adequate repairs or replacements reduced all to a state of disintegration.

Railroad mileage was of course located mostly in rural areas. The war followed the rails, and over two-thirds of the South&#x27;s rails, bridges, rail yards, repair shops and rolling stock were in areas reached by Union armies, which systematically destroyed what it could. The South had of track, and were in areas reached by the Union armies. About were in areas where Sherman and other Union generals adopted a policy of systematic destruction of the rail system. Even in untouched areas, the lack of maintenance and repair, the absence of new equipment, the heavy over-use, and the deliberate movement of equipment by the Confederates from remote areas to the war zone guaranteed the system would be virtually ruined at war&#x27;s end.
The war was effectively over with the surrender at Appomattox Court House in April 1865. There were no trials for insurgency or treason and only one war crimes trial.

==Reconstruction (1865–1877)==

The Reconstruction era began following the end of the Civil War in 1865 and lasted until 1877. During this time, the Union Army took control of former Confederate states, except for Tennessee; the start and ending times of Union Army occupation varied by state. Slavery ended and the large slave-based plantations were mostly subdivided into tenant or sharecropper farms of . Many white farmers (and some blacks) owned their land. However sharecropping, along with tenant farming, became a dominant form in the cotton South from the 1870s to the 1950s, among both blacks and whites. By the 1960s both had largely disappeared.

Sharecropping was a way for very poor farmers to earn a living from land owned by someone else. The landowner provided land, housing, tools and seed, and perhaps a mule, and a local merchant provided food and supplies on credit. At harvest time the sharecropper received a share of the crop (from one-third to one-half, with the landowner taking the rest). The cropper used his share to pay off his debt to the merchant. The system started with blacks when large plantations were subdivided. By the 1880s white farmers also became sharecroppers.

The system was distinct from that of the tenant farmer, who rented the land, provided his own tools and mule, and received half the crop. Landowners provided more supervision to sharecroppers, and less or none to tenant farmers.

===Political Reconstruction===
Reconstruction was the process by which the states returned to full status. It took place in four stages, which varied by state. Tennessee and the border states were not affected. First came the governments appointed by President Andrew Johnson that lasted 1865–1866. The Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau was active, helping refugees, setting up employment contracts for Freedmen, and setting up courts and schools for the freedmen. Second came rule by the U.S. Army, which held elections that included all freedmen and also excluded over 10,000 former Confederate leaders on account of their prior war on the United States government. Third was &quot;Radical Reconstruction&quot; or &quot;Black Reconstruction&quot; in which a Republican coalition governed the state, comprising a coalition of freedmen, scalawags (native Southern whites) and carpetbaggers (migrants from the North). Violent terrorism by the Ku Klux Klan and related groups was suppressed by President Ulysses S. Grant and the vigorous use of federal courts and soldiers. The Reconstruction governments spent large sums on railroad subsidies and schools, but quadrupled taxes and set off a tax revolt. Stage four was reached by 1876 by a coalition of white supremacists and former confederates, called &quot;Redeemers&quot;, had won political control of all the states except South Carolina, Florida and Louisiana. The disputed presidential election of 1876 hinged on those three violently contested states. The outcome was the Compromise of 1877, whereby the Republican Rutherford Hayes became president and all federal troops were withdrawn from the South, leading to the immediate collapse of the last Republican state governments in the 19th century.

===Railroads===
The building of a new, modern rail system was widely seen as essential to the economic recovery of the South, and modernizers invested in a &quot;Gospel of Prosperity&quot;. Northern money financed the rebuilding and dramatic expansion of railroads throughout the South; they were modernized in terms of rail gauge, equipment and standards of service.
The Panic of 1873 ended the expansion everywhere in the United States, leaving many Southern lines bankrupt or barely able to pay the interest on their bonds.

The Southern network still expanded from in 1870 to in 1890. Railroads helped create a mechanically skilled group of craftsmen and broke the isolation of much of the region. Passengers were few, however, and apart from hauling the cotton crop when it was harvested, there was little freight traffic. The lines were owned and directed overwhelmingly by Northerners, who often had to pay heavy bribes to corrupt politicians for needed legislation.

===Backlash to Reconstruction===

Reconstruction offended former confederates who found themselves without the ability to vote due to the Ironclad Oath Anti Confederate disenfranchisement sometimes excluded 10–20% of white voters in certain states and smaller groups in others. Most Ex Confederate restrictions were lifted by 1870 though all were completely repealed in 1884.

Reconstruction was also a time when many African Americans and some poor whites began to secure these same rights for the first time. With the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution (which outlawed slavery), the 14th Amendment (which granted full U.S. citizenship to African Americans) and the 15th Amendment (which extended the right to vote to black males), African Americans in the South began to enjoy more rights than they had ever had in the past.

A reaction to the defeat and changes in society began immediately, with terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan arising in 1866 as the first line of insurgents. They attacked and killed both freedmen and their white allies. By the 1870s, more organized paramilitary groups, such as the White League and Red Shirts, took part in turning Republicans out of office and barring or intimidating black people from voting. A standard example of white supremacist violence in the period is the Camilla massacre where twelve African Americans were murdered by a mob for attempting to attend a Republican political rally. The brutality caused Congress to temporarily revoke Georgia&#x27;s statehood.

Mississippi Representative Wiley P. Harris, a Democrat, explained the white supremacist perspective in 1875:If any two hundred Southern men backed by a Federal administration should go to Indianapolis, turn out the Indiana people, take possession of all the seats of power, honor, and profit, denounce the people at large as assassins and barbarians, introduce corruption in all the branches of the public administration, make government a curse instead of a blessing, league with the most ignorant class of society to make war on the enlightened, intelligent, and virtuous, what kind of social relations would such a state of things beget.

==The South: rural life, Jim Crow and reindustrialization 1877–1933==
Agriculture&#x27;s share of the labor force by region, 1890:
=== Economy of the Jim Crow South ===


The South remained heavily rural until World War II. In the decades before the 1940s, there were only a few scattered large cities in the region, with small courthouse towns serving the mostly rural population. Local politics revolved around the politicians and lawyers based at the courthouse. Mill towns, primarily focused on textile production or tobacco product manufacture, began opening in the Piedmont region, especially in the Carolinas. Racial segregation and outward signs of inequality were commonplace in many rural areas and rarely challenged. Blacks who violated the color line were liable to expulsion or lynching. Cotton became even more important than before, even though prices were much lower. The number of small farms in rural areas overtime proliferated, and became smaller and smaller as the population grew.

Many white farmers, and some black farmers, were tenant farmers who owned their work animals and tools, and rented their land. Others were day laborers or impoverished sharecroppers, who worked under the supervision of the landowner. Sharecropping was a way for landless farmers (both black and white) to earn a living. The landowner provided land, housing, tools and seed, and perhaps a mule, and a local country storekeeper loaned credit for food and supplies. At harvest time, the sharecropper received a share of the crop (from one-third to one-half), which paid off his debt to the merchant. By the late 1860s, white farmers had also become sharecroppers. The cropper system was a step below that of the tenant farmer, who rented the land, provided his own tools and mule, and received half the crop. Landowners provided more supervision to sharecroppers, and less or none to tenant farmers.

There was little cash in circulation, since most farmers operated on credit accounts from local merchants, and paid off their debts at cotton harvest time in the fall.

Although there were small country churches everywhere, there were only a few dilapidated schools in rural areas. High schools were available in the cities, but were hard to find in most rural areas. All the Southern high schools combined graduated 66,000 students in 1928. The school terms were shorter in the South, and total spending per student was much lower. Nationwide, the students in elementary and secondary schools attended 140 days of school in 1928, compared to 123 days for white children in the South and 95 for blacks. The national average in 1928 for school expenditures was $70,700 for every 1,000 children aged 5–17. Only Florida reached that level, and seven of the thirteen Southern states spent under $31,000 per 1,000 children. Conditions were marginally better in newer growing areas, such as in Texas and central Florida, with the deepest poverty in South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Hookworm and other diseases sapped the vitality of many Southerners in rural areas.

Longstanding history was written by C. Vann Woodward, &quot;The Origins of the New South: 1877–1913&quot;, which was published in 1951 by Louisiana State University Press. Sheldon Hackney explains:

Of one thing we may be certain at the outset. The durability of &quot;Origins of the New South&quot; is not a result of its ennobling and uplifting message. It is the story of the decay and decline of the aristocracy, the suffering and betrayal of the poor whites, and the rise and transformation of a middle class.

It is not a happy story. The Redeemers are revealed to be as venal as the carpetbaggers. The declining aristocracy are ineffectual and money hungry, and in the last analysis they subordinated the values of their political and social heritage in order to maintain control over the black population. The poor whites suffered from strange malignancies of racism and conspiracy-mindedness, and the rising middle class was timid and self-interested even in its reform movement. The most sympathetic characters in the whole sordid affair are simply those who are too powerless to be blamed for their actions.

Meanwhile, the first major oil well in the South was drilled at Spindletop near Beaumont, Texas, on the morning of January 10, 1901. Other oil fields were later discovered nearby in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting &quot;Oil Boom&quot; permanently transformed the economy of the West South Central states and produced the richest economic expansion after the Civil War. Certain locations of the South also took part of major inventions of the Gilded Age, including the Wright Flyer in the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

=== The Jim Crow Era: segregation, disenfranchisement and oppression ===


After the Redeemers took control in the mid-1870s, Jim Crow laws were created to legally enforce racial segregation in public facilities and services. The phrase &quot;separate but equal&quot;, upheld in the 1896 Supreme Court case &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, came to represent the notion that whites and blacks should have access to physically separate but ostensibly equal facilities. It would not be until 1954 that &quot;Plessy&quot; was overturned in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, and only in the late 1960s was segregation fully repealed by legislation passed following the efforts of the civil rights movement.

The most extreme white leader was Senator Ben Tillman of South Carolina, who proudly proclaimed in 1900, &quot;We have done our level best [to prevent blacks from voting] ... we have scratched our heads to find out how we could eliminate the last one of them. We stuffed ballot boxes. We shot them. We are not ashamed of it.&quot; With no voting rights and no voice in government, blacks in the South were subjected to a system of segregation and discrimination. Blacks and whites attended separate schools. Blacks could not serve on juries, which meant that they had little if any legal recourse. In &quot;Black Boy&quot;, an autobiographical account of life during this time, Richard Wright writes about being struck with a bottle and knocked from a moving truck for failing to call a white man &quot;sir&quot;. Between 1889 and 1922, the NAACP calculates that lynchings reached their worst level in history, with almost 3,500 people, three-fourths of them black men, murdered.

From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven former Confederate states, along with Oklahoma upon statehood, passed disenfranchising constitutions or amendments that introduced voter registration barriers such as poll taxes, residency requirements and literacy tests that were hard for minorities to meet. Most African Americans, most Mexican Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites were disenfranchised, losing the vote for decades. In some states, grandfather clauses temporarily exempted white illiterates from literacy tests. The numbers of voters dropped drastically throughout the former Confederacy as a result. This can be seen via the feature &quot;Turnout in Presidential and Midterm Elections&quot; at the University of Texas&#x27; &quot;Politics: Barriers to Voting&quot;. Alabama, which had established universal white suffrage in 1819 when it became a state, also substantially reduced voting by poor whites. Democrat-controlled legislatures passed Jim Crow laws to segregate public facilities and services, including transportation.

While African Americans, poor whites and civil rights groups started litigation against such provisions in the early 20th century, for decades Supreme Court decisions overturning such provisions were rapidly followed by new state laws with new devices to restrict voting. Most blacks in the former Confederacy and Oklahoma could not vote until 1965, after passage of the Voting Rights Act and Federal enforcement to ensure people could register. Despite increases in the eligible voting population with the inclusion of women, blacks, and those eighteen and over throughout this period, turnout in ex-Confederate states remained below the national average throughout the 20th century. Not until the late 1960s did all American citizens regain protected civil rights by passage of legislation following the leadership of the American Civil Rights Movement.
Historian William Chafe has explored the defensive techniques developed inside the African American community to avoid the worst features of Jim Crow as expressed in the legal system, unbalanced economic power, and intimidation and psychological pressure. Chafe says &quot;protective socialization by blacks themselves&quot; was created inside the community to accommodate white-imposed sanctions while subtly encouraging challenges to those sanctions. Known as &quot;walking the tightrope,&quot; such efforts at bringing about change were only slightly effective before the 1920s, but did build the foundation that younger African Americans deployed in their aggressive, large-scale activism during the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 1960s.

In the early 20th century, invasion of the boll weevil devastated cotton crops in the South, producing an additional catalyst to African Americans&#x27; decisions to leave the South. From 1910 to 1970, more than 6.5 million African Americans left the South in the Great Migration to Northern and Western cities, defecting from persistent lynching, violence, segregation, poor education, and inability to vote. Black migration transformed many Northern and Western cities, creating new cultures and music. Many African Americans, like other groups, became industrial workers; others started their own businesses within the communities. Southern whites also migrated to industrial cities like Chicago, Detroit, Oakland, and Los Angeles, where they took jobs in the booming new auto and defense industry.

=== Public health===
Compared to the North and West, the South was always a warmer climate that fostered diseases. It had far fewer cities and they lagged the North in innovation. After the Civil War it was a much more sickly region, lacking in doctors, hospitals, medicine, and all aspects of public health. When a threat of yellow fever appeared Southern cities imposed temporary quarantines to stop travel from infected areas. The rest of the time there was inaction, and a reluctance to spend on sanitation. Most Southerners were too poor to buy the patent medicines that were so popular elsewhere. Instead there was a heavy reliance on cheap herbal and folk remedies, especially among African Americans and Appalachians. 
===Hookworm===
The urban-rural dichotomy has a medical dimension.
Two major diseases, malaria and hookworm, historically were rural phenomenon in warm areas of the South. They were stamped out by large-scale efforts to clean up the environment. Malaria is spread by the bite of a particular species of mosquito, and is eradicated by systematically draining pools of stagnant water or spraying with DDT.

The Rockefeller Sanitary Commission in 1910 discovered that nearly half the farm people, white and Black, in the poorest parts of the South were infected with hookworms. In the typical victim hundreds of the worms live hooked to the wall inside the small intestine, eat the best food, and leave the victim weak and listless. It was called the &quot;germ of laziness.&quot; Victims were infected by walking barefoot in grassy areas where people defecate. In the long run outhouses and shoes solved the problem but the Commission developed a quick cure. The volunteer drank a special medicine that loosened the insects&#x27; grip, then drank a strong laxative. When most residents did so the hookworms would be gone. The Commission, headed by Wickliffe Rose, helped state health departments set up eradication crusades that treated 440,000 people in 578 counties in all 11 Southern states, and ended the epidemic.

===The Black South===
In the Southern states 1890s to 1930s, Jim Crow virtually dictated inferior medical care for the large, very poor African American minority. There was neglect and racism on the part of white physicians. Black physicians were too few and too poorly trained at their two small schools, Howard University and Meharry Medical College. Likewise nursing standards were subpar, and there were very few all-Black hospitals. The southern progressive movement did initiate reforms that helped somewhat, as did Northern philanthropies, but the whites benefitted more.
====The Tuskegee study====
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study, officially named &quot;The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male,&quot; was a highly unethical medical research project conducted by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1932 to 19721. The study involved 600 African American men from Macon County, Alabama, of whom 399 had latent syphilis and 201 were uninfected controls. White physicians were in charge, but it employed black doctors and nurses. The goal was to study. untreated syphilis, so no treatments for that disease were allowed. to the experiments participants, even after the discovery of penicillin as an effective treatment. The men were told they had &quot;bad blood&quot; and were offered free medical care, meals, and burial insurance as incentives. Originally planned to last 6-9 months, the study continued for 40 years until it was exposed by the press in 1972. At least 28 men died directly from syphilis; 100 died from related complications; 40 wives were infected; and 19 children were born with congenital syphilis. A major result of the exposure was a long-term, deep distrust of. professional medicine on the part of the black community.

== Depression and the home front of the south 1933–1945==
Later, the Southern economy was dealt additional blows by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the economy suffered significant reversals and millions were left unemployed. Beginning in 1934 and lasting until 1939, an ecological disaster of severe wind and drought caused an exodus from Texas and Arkansas, the Oklahoma Panhandle region, and the surrounding plains, in which over 500,000 Americans were homeless, hungry and jobless. Thousands would leave the region to seek economic opportunities along the West Coast. While Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s progressive coalition and even Franklin&#x27;s spouse Eleanor Roosevelt desired reforms, the Roosevelt administration did not interfere with Jim Crow and other racist policies as part of a compromise with the segregationist wing of the Southern Democratic Party. Without congressional votes from segregationist democrats New Deal legislation would have likely been blocked by congress.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt noted the South as the &quot;number one priority&quot; in terms of need of assistance during the Great Depression. His administration created programs such as the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to provide rural electrification and stimulate development. Locked into low-productivity agriculture, the region&#x27;s growth was slowed by limited industrial development, low levels of entrepreneurship, and the lack of capital investment.

World War II marked a time of dramatic change within the South from an economic standpoint, as new industries and military bases were developed by the federal government, providing much needed capital and infrastructure in many regions. People from all parts of the US came to the South for military training and work in the region&#x27;s many bases and new industries. During and after the war millions of hard-scrabble farmers, both white and black, left agriculture for other occupations and urban jobs.
The United States began mobilizing for war in a major way in the spring of 1940. The warm weather of the South proved ideal for building 60% of the Army&#x27;s new training camps and nearly half the new airfields. In all, 40% of spending on new military installations went to the South. For example, in 1940 the small town of 1500 people in Starke, Florida, became the base of Camp Blanding. By March 1941, 20,000 men were constructing a permanent camp for 60,000 soldiers. Money flowed freely for the war effort, as over $4 billion went into military facilities in the South, and another $5 billion into defense plants. Major shipyards were built in Virginia, and Charleston, SC, and along the Gulf Coast.

Huge warplane plants were opened in Dallas-Fort Worth and Georgia. The most secret and expensive operation was at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where unlimited amounts of locally generated electricity were used to prepare uranium for the atom bomb. The number of production workers doubled during the war. Most training centers, factories and shipyards were closed in 1945, but not all, and the families that left hardscrabble farms remained to find jobs in the growing urban South. The region had finally reached the take off stage into industrial and commercial growth, although its income and wage levels lagged well behind the national average. Nevertheless, as George B. Tindall notes, the transformation was, &quot;The demonstration of industrial potential, new habits of mind, and a recognition that industrialization demanded community services.&quot;

Per capita income jumped 140% from 1940 to 1945, compared to 100% elsewhere in the United States. Southern income rose from 59% to 65%. Dewey Grantham says the war, &quot;brought an abrupt departure from the South&#x27;s economic backwardness, poverty, and distinctive rural life, as the region moved perceptively closer to the mainstream of national economic and social life.&quot;

==The Remaking of The South 1945–1975==
===Race: from Jim Crow to the Civil Rights Movement===


African Americans responded to persistent oppression in the south with two major reactions: the Great Migration and the civil rights movement.

The Great Migration began during World War I, hitting its high point during World War II. During this migration, black people left the racism and lack of opportunities in the South and settled in northern cities like Chicago, where they found work in factories and other sectors of the economy. This migration produced a new sense of independence in the black community and contributed to the vibrant black urban culture seen in the emergence of jazz and the blues from New Orleans and its spread north to Memphis and Chicago.

The migration also empowered the growing civil rights movement. While the movement existed in all parts of the United States to combat Jim Crow law policies, its focus was against the Jim Crow laws taking place in the South. Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the Montgomery bus boycott, the Mississippi Freedom Summer, the Selma to Montgomery marches, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;.

Most of the major events in the movement occurred in the South, including the Montgomery bus boycott, the Mississippi Freedom Summer, the March on Selma, Alabama, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In addition, some of the most important writings to come out of the movement were written in the South, such as King&#x27;s &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;. Most of the civil rights landmarks can be found around the South. The Birmingham Civil Rights National Monument in Birmingham includes the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute which details Birmingham&#x27;s role as the center of the Civil Rights Movement. The 16th Street Baptist Church served as a rallying point for coordinating and carrying out the Birmingham campaign as well as the adjacent Kelly Ingram Park that served as ground zero for the infamous children&#x27;s protest that eventually led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been rededicated as a place of &quot;Revolution and Reconciliation&quot; and is now the setting of moving sculptures related to the battle for Civil Rights in the city, both are center pieces of the Birmingham Civil Rights District. The Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta includes a museum that chronicles the American Civil Rights Movement as well as Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s boyhood home on Auburn Avenue. Additionally, Ebenezer Baptist Church is located in the Sweet Auburn district as is the King Center, location of Martin Luther and Coretta Scott King&#x27;s gravesites.

Confrontations continued to escalate. In summer 1963, there were 800 demonstrations in 200 southern cities and towns, with over 100,000 participants, and 15,000 arrests. In Alabama in June 1963, Governor George Wallace escalated the crisis by defying court orders to admit the first two black students to the University of Alabama. Kennedy responded by sending Congress a comprehensive civil rights bill, and ordered Attorney General Robert Kennedy to file federal lawsuits against segregated schools, and to deny funds for discriminatory programs. Doctor King launched a massive march on Washington in August 1963, bringing out 200,000 demonstrators in front of the Lincoln Memorial, the largest political assembly in the nation&#x27;s history. The Kennedy administration now gave full-fledged support to the civil rights movement, but powerful southern congressmen blocked any legislation. After Kennedy was assassinated President Lyndon Johnson called for immediate passage of Kennedy civil rights legislation as a memorial to the martyred president. Johnson formed a coalition with Northern Republicans that led to passage in the House, and with the help of Republican Senate leader Everett Dirksen with passage in the Senate early in 1964. For the first time in history, the southern filibuster was broken and the Senate finally passed its version on June 19 by vote of 73 to 27. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was the most powerful affirmation of equal rights ever made by Congress. It guaranteed access to public accommodations such as restaurants and places of amusement, authorized the Justice Department to bring suits to desegregate facilities in schools, gave new powers to the Civil Rights Commission; and allowed federal funds to be cut off in cases of discrimination. Furthermore, racial, religious and gender discrimination was outlawed for businesses with 25 or more employees, as well as apartment houses. The South resisted until the last moment, but as soon as the new law was signed by President Johnson on July 2, 1964, it was widely accepted across the nation. There was only a scattering of diehard opposition, typified by restaurant owner Lester Maddox in Georgia, who became governor, but the great majority of restaurants and hotels in Georgia followed the new law as the business community realized that peaceful integration was the only way forward.

In January 1965, Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and other civil rights leaders organized several peaceful demonstrations in Selma, which were violently attacked by police and white counter-protesters. Throughout January and February, these protests received national media coverage and drew attention to the issue of voting rights. King and other demonstrators were arrested during a march on February 1 for violating an anti-parade ordinance; this inspired similar marches in the following days, causing hundreds more to be arrested. On February 4, civil rights leader Malcolm X gave a militant speech in Selma in which he said that many African Americans did not support King&#x27;s nonviolent approach; he later privately said that he wanted to frighten whites into supporting King. The next day, King was released and a letter he wrote addressing voting rights, &quot;Letter From A Selma Jail&quot;, appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

With increasing national attention focused on Selma and voting rights, President Johnson reversed his decision to delay voting rights legislation. On February 6, he announced he would send a proposal to Congress. Johnson did not reveal the proposal&#x27;s content or disclose when it would come before Congress.

On February 18 in Marion, Alabama, state troopers violently broke up a nighttime voting-rights march during which officer James Bonard Fowler shot and killed young African-American protester Jimmie Lee Jackson, who was unarmed and protecting his mother. Spurred by this event, and at the initiation of Bevel, on March 7 SCLC and SNCC began the first of the Selma to Montgomery marches, in which Selma residents intended to march to Alabama&#x27;s capital, Montgomery, to highlight voting rights issues and present Governor George Wallace with their grievances. On the first march, demonstrators were stopped by state and county police on horseback at the Edmund Pettus Bridge near Selma. The police shot tear gas into the crowd and trampled protesters. Televised footage of the scene, which became known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, generated outrage across the country.

A second march was held on March 9, which became known as &quot;Turnaround Tuesday&quot;. That evening, three white Unitarian ministers who participated in the march were attacked on the street and beaten with clubs by four Ku Klux Klan members. The worst injured was Reverend James Reeb from Boston, who died on Thursday, March 11.

In the wake of the events in Selma, President Johnson, addressing a televised joint session of Congress on March 15, called on legislators to enact expansive voting rights legislation. In his speech, he used the words &quot;we shall overcome&quot;, adopting the rallying cry of the civil rights movement. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was introduced in Congress two days later while civil rights leaders, now under the protection of federal troops, led a march of 25,000 people from Selma to Montgomery.

After the passage of the Voting Rights Act, President Lyndon Johnson with the support and urging of Civil Rights leaders launched the War on poverty. This ambitious set of programs sought to eradicate poverty across the United States, when the program began 45.9 percentage of America&#x27;s impoverished lived in the South though it had only 31% of the population. Fifty years later, poverty did not disappear but it was also less concentrated in the Southeast Region and was more balanced across the country as a whole.

Since the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, black people have gone on to hold many offices within the Southern states. Black people have been elected or appointed as mayors or police chiefs in the cities of Atlanta, Baltimore, Birmingham, Charlotte, Columbia, Dover, Houston, Jackson, Jacksonville, Memphis, Montgomery, Nashville, New Orleans, Raleigh, Richmond, and Washington. They have also gone on to serve in both the U.S. Congress and state legislatures of Southern states.

Since 1970, the proportion of the African American population living in the South stabilized and began slightly increasing.

===Collapse of the Black Belt socioeconomic plantation system===
Economic historians of the South generally emphasize the continuity of the system of white supremacy and cotton plantations in the Black Belt from the late colonial era into the mid-20th century, when it collapsed. Harold D, Woodman summarizes the explanation that external forces caused the disintegration from the 1920s to the 1970s:
:When a significant change finally occurred, its impetus came from outside the South. Depression-bred New Deal reforms, war-induced demand for labor in the North, perfection of cotton-picking machinery, and civil rights legislation and court decisions finally... destroyed the plantation system, undermined landlord or merchant hegemony, diversified agriculture and transformed it from a labor- to a capital-intensive industry, and ended the legal and extra-legal support for racism. The discontinuity that war, invasion, military occupation, the confiscation of slave property, and state and national legislation failed to bring in the mid-19th century, finally arrived in the second third of the 20th century. A &quot;second reconstruction&quot; created a real New South.

==A New South (1975-Onward)==
===Politics- The Great Partisan Switch ===
Southern liberals were an essential part of the New Deal coalition – without them Roosevelt lacked majorities in Congress. Typical leaders were Lyndon B. Johnson in Texas, Jim Folsom and John Sparkman in Alabama, Claude Pepper in Florida, Earl Long and Hale Boggs in Louisiana, and Estes Kefauver in Tennessee. They promoted subsidies for small farmers, and supported the nascent labor union movement.

An essential condition for this north–south coalition was for northern liberals to ignore the problem of racism throughout the South and elsewhere in the country. After 1945, however, northern liberals led especially by young Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota increasingly made civil rights a central issue. They convinced Truman to join them in 1948. The conservative Southern Democrats the Dixiecrats took control of the state parties in half the region and ran Strom Thurmond for president against Truman. Thurmond carried only the Deep South, but that threat was enough to guarantee the national Democratic Party in 1952 and 1956 would not make civil rights a major issue. In 1956, 101 of the 128 southern congressmen and senators signed the Southern Manifesto denouncing forced desegregation.

The labor movement in the South was divided, and lost its political influence. Southern liberals were in a quandary – most of them kept quiet or moderated their liberalism, others switched sides, and the rest continued on the liberal path. One by one, the last group was defeated; historian Numan V. Bartley states, &quot;Indeed, the very word &#x27;liberal&#x27; gradually disappeared from the southern political lexicon, except as a term of opprobrium.&quot;

The Republican candidates for president have won the South in elections since 1972, except for 1976. The region is not, however, entirely monolithic, and every successful Democratic candidate since 1976 has claimed at least three Southern states. Barack Obama won Florida, Maryland, Delaware, North Carolina, and Virginia in 2008 but did not repeat his victory in North Carolina during his 2012 reelection campaign. Joe Biden also performed well for a modern Democrat in the South, winning Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and Georgia, in the 2020 United States presidential election.

===Removal of Confederate Monuments ===

More than 160 monuments and memorials to the Confederate States of America (CSA; the Confederacy) and associated figures have been removed from public spaces in the United States, mostly in the south all but five after 2015. Some have been removed by state and local governments; others have been torn down by protestors.

More than 700 such monuments and memorials have been created on public land, the vast majority in the South during the era of Jim Crow laws from 1877 to 1964. Efforts to remove them increased after the Charleston church shooting in 2015, the Unite the Right rally in 2017, and the murder of George Floyd in 2020.

Proponents of their removal cite historical analysis that the monuments were not built as memorials, but to intimidate African Americans and reaffirm white supremacy after the Civil War; and that they memorialize an unrecognized, treasonous government, the Confederacy, whose founding principle was the perpetuation and expansion of slavery. They also argue that the presence of these memorials more than a hundred years after the defeat of the Confederacy continues to disenfranchise and alienate African Americans.

Opponents view removing the monuments as erasing history or a sign of disrespect for heritage; white nationalists and neo-Nazis in particular have mounted protests and opposition to the removals. Some Southern states passed state laws restricting or prohibiting the removal or alteration of public monuments.

===Economy and Society===

In the decades following World War II, the old agrarian Southern economy evolved into the &quot;New South&quot; – a manufacturing region. High-rise buildings began to emerge throughout the mid-to-late 20th century, in skylines of cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, Dallas, Houston, Memphis, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, San Antonio, and Tampa. The former main economic base that focused largely on agriculture, such as cotton production, was phased out with mechanization technologies and economic diversification of new industries. There were 1.5 million cotton farms in 1945, and only 18,600 remained in 2009. By 2020, many Fortune 500 companies were headquartered in the South. Texas led the nation by having over 50, Virginia with 22, Georgia with 18, Florida with 18, North Carolina with 13, and Tennessee with 10. There were also 149 Fortune 500 companies in the entire Southeast region including the District of Columbia.
The industrialization and modernization of the South continued to pick up speed with the ending of racial segregation policies in the 1960s. Today, the economy of the South is a diverse mixture of agriculture, light and heavy industry, tourism, and high technology companies, that help serve both the national economy and global economy. State governments in the South recruited corporate businesses to the &quot;Sun Belt&quot;, promising more enjoyable weather, a lower cost of living, skilled work force positions, minimal taxes, weak labor unions, and a business-friendly environment. With the expansion of jobs in the South, there has been migration of people from other U.S. regions and immigrants from other countries, increasing the population and political influence of southern states. The newcomers and growing population within the region helped in displacing the old rural political system, built around courthouse cliques from the late 19th century through mid-20th century. Many suburb areas became the base of the emerging Republican Party within the region, which became dominant in presidential elections by 1968, and in most state politics by the 1990s.

With the economy growing into other job sectors during the mid-to-late 20th century, farming was less emphasized as before (and the remaining farmers more often specialized in things such as soybeans and cattle, or citrus in Florida). The need for cotton pickers largely ended with the use of mechanization technologies, and nearly all of the black cotton farmers moved to urban areas either within the region, or to cities in the North or Midwest. Former white farmers, usually moved within the region to nearby towns or cities. The early-to-mid 20th century also saw many factories and service industries opening in towns throughout the region for employment, which served as new job occupations.

During the 20th century, millions of non-Southern U.S. migrants and retirees have moved down for job opportunities and mild winters. Oftentimes they have moved into homes located near the coast, which, over the years, resulted in increasingly expensive hurricane damages. Tourism has become a major industry as well, especially in venues such as Williamsburg, Virginia, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, San Antonio, Texas, Orlando, Florida, and Branson, Missouri.

Apart from the still-distinctive weather climate, the living experience in the South increasingly resembles a melting pot of cultures in many places, especially in urban and metropolitan areas. The arrival of millions of non-southern U.S. migrants (especially in the suburbs and coastal areas), including millions of Hispanics, along with many immigrants from different countries, has led to the introduction of different cultural values and social norms not rooted in Southern traditions. Observers conclude that collective identity and Southern distinctiveness are thus declining, particularly when defined against &quot;an earlier South that was somehow more authentic, real, more unified and distinct.&quot; The process has worked both ways, however, with aspects of Southern culture spreading throughout a greater portion of the rest of the United States in a process termed &quot;Southernization&quot;.

==South&#x27;s impact on the United States==
===South in American foreign policy===

The South always had a strong, aggressive interest in foreign affairs, especially regarding expansion to the Southwest, and the importance of foreign markets for Southern exports of cotton, tobacco and oil. All the southern colonies supported the American Revolution, with Virginia taking a leading position within the colonies.

The South generally supported the War of 1812, in sharp distinction to the strong opposition in the Northeast, from the remaining Federalist Party activists. Southern Democrats took the lead in support of Texas annexation, and the war with Mexico. Low tariff policy was a priority, with the partial exception of the sugar region of Louisiana.

Throughout southern history, exports were the main foundation of the southern economy, starting with tobacco, rice and indigo in the colonial period. After 1800, cotton comprised the chief export of the United States. In the American Civil War, Confederate officials thought mistakenly that European need for cotton would require intervention to help the South, for &quot;Cotton is King.&quot; Southerners calculated their need for international markets called for aggressive internationalist foreign policies.

Woodrow Wilson, who served as U.S. president from 1913 to 1921, had a strong base in the South for his foreign policy regarding World War I and the League of Nations. In the 1930s, isolationism and America First attitudes were weakest in the South, and internationalism strongest there. Southern Conservative Democrats opposed the domestic policies of the New Deal, but strongly supported Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s internationalist foreign policy during World War II.

Historians have given various explanations for this characteristic, such as the region having a strong military tradition. General George Marshall, a graduate of Virginia Military Institute, is famous for the Marshall Plan to help rebuild Europe after World War II. Rather than pacifism, the South fostered chivalry and honor, pride in its fighting ability, and indifference to violence.

Virginia Senator Carter Glass proclaimed in May, 1941: &quot;Virginia has always been a leader in the vanguard of the fight for freedom. She is ready today as in the past to give virile leadership to the nation.&quot; During the Vietnam War, there were some dissenters from aggression such as J. William Fulbright (Arkansas), and Martin Luther King Jr. (Georgia), as opposed to Lyndon Johnson (Texas) and Secretary of State Dean Rusk (Georgia), but the war was generally more supported in the South.

===Southern presidents===
During the history of the United States, many of the 45 individuals who have served as U.S. president have been from the South. Virginia was the birthplace of seven of the nation&#x27;s first twelve presidents (including four of the first five).

This list encompasses members of the Whig Party, the Republican Party, and the Democratic Party; in addition, Washington, while officially non-partisan, was generally associated with the Federalist Party.

Presidents born in the South and identified with the region include:

*George Washington of Virginia (term 1789–1797)
*Thomas Jefferson of Virginia (term 1801–1809)
*James Madison of Virginia (term 1809–1817)
*James Monroe of Virginia (term 1817–1825)
*Andrew Jackson, born in either North Carolina or South Carolina, identified with Tennessee (term 1829–1837)
*John Tyler of Virginia (term 1841–1845)
*James Knox Polk, born in North Carolina, identified with Tennessee (term 1845–1849)
*Zachary Taylor of Virginia (term 1849–1850)
*Andrew Johnson, born in North Carolina, identified with Tennessee (term 1865–1869)
*Lyndon Baines Johnson of Texas (term 1963–1969)
*Jimmy Carter of Georgia (term 1977–1981)
*Bill Clinton of Arkansas (term 1993–2001)

One president was born in the South, and is identified both with the South and elsewhere:
*Woodrow Wilson (term 1913–1921) was born and raised in the South. Although his academic and political career was in New Jersey, he still retained strong ties with the South.

Presidents born outside the South, but generally identified with the region:
*George H. W. Bush, born in Massachusetts, but spent his adult life in Texas (term 1989–1993)
*George W. Bush, born in Connecticut, lived from early childhood in Texas (term 2001–2009)

Presidents born in Southern states, but not primarily identified with that region, include:
*William Henry Harrison, born in Virginia, identified with Ohio (term 1841)
*Abraham Lincoln, born in Kentucky, moved at age 7; identified with Illinois (term 1861–1865)
*Dwight D. Eisenhower, born in Texas, moved at age 2 and identified with Kansas (term 1953–1961)

<text>Patrick Joseph Lalor (21 July 1926 – 29 July 2016) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician and former hurling player for Laois. He was a Teachta Dála (TD) for Laois–Offaly between 1961 and 1981, and a government minister on two separate occasions during the 19th Dáil. He later represented Leinster in the European Parliament from 1979 to 1994.

==Hurling career==
Lalor was a member of the Laois team that won the Leinster Senior Hurling Championship in 1949. The team went on to compete in the All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final but lost to Tipperary. Later that year he helped his club Abbeyleix to win the Laois Senior Hurling Championship. Between 1953 and 1956, Lalor was county secretary of Laois GAA.

He played football and hurling for his club and county for many years and is generally regarded as one of the most skillful hurlers to have pulled Laois jersey. This was evidenced by his selection in 1999 on the Laois Hurling Team of the Millennium.

Lalor played 70 times for Laois senior hurlers, scoring 199 points in his time with the senior team. At the time of his retirement, he was the all-time top scorer for the county and was top of the scoring charts for over 20 years. He also played five times for the senior footballers, scoring 13 points.

==Political career==
Lalor was elected to Dáil Éireann on his first attempt at the 1961 general election as a Fianna Fáil TD for Laois–Offaly in the 17th Dáil. In 1965, he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture. The following year, Lalor became Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power and Posts and Telegraphs. Following the 1969 election, Lalor joined the cabinet of Jack Lynch as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In the cabinet reshuffle that took place following the Arms Crisis in 1970, he took over the Industry and Commerce portfolio, serving in that position until the 1973 general election, when a Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition took power.

Fianna Fáil was re-elected in a landslide victory at the 1977 general election and Lalor became Government Chief Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence. In 1979, he was elected to the European Parliament for the Leinster constituency and did not stand for a fifth re-election in the 1981 general election. He was re-elected to the European Parliament in 1984 and 1989, before retiring from politics in 1994. During his time as a member of the European Parliament, he was vice-chair of the parliamentary grouping the European Progressive Democrats and its successor the European Democratic Alliance. He was also a Vice-President of the European Parliament from 1982 to 1987.

== Personal life ==
Lalor died on 29 July 2016 at the age of 90. He was survived by his four children. Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin paid tribute to Lalor saying he &quot;had a very distinguished career and represented the people of Laois-Offaly with great pride.&quot;

<doc id="1080354" wikidata="Q208352" url="?curid=1080354" title="Borjomi">
<text>Borjomi () is a resort town in south-central Georgia with a population of 11,173 (as of 2024). Located 165 km from Tbilisi, it is one of the six municipalities of the Samtskhe–Javakheti region and is situated in the northwestern part of the region in the picturesque Borjomi Gorge on the eastern edge of Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park. The town is noted for its mineral water industry (which is the number one export of Georgia), the Romanov summer palace in Likani and Borjomi-Kharagauli National Park. Borjomi mineral water is particularly well-known in Georgia as well as other countries that were part of the former Soviet Union; the bottling of mineral water is a major source of income for the area. Because of the supposed curative powers of the area&#x27;s mineral springs, it is a frequent destination for people with health problems. Borjomi is also home to the most extensive ecologically-themed amusement park in the Caucasus.

==History==


In the Middle Ages, the area of what is now Borjomi was part of the Tori province. It was populated by a series of forts guarding the strategic crossroad of routes leading to the western, eastern, and southern provinces of Georgia. Three important forts – those of “Gogia”, “Petra”, and “Sali” – still overlook the town from nearby hills. From the 16th century into the 19th, the area belonged to the noble family of Avalishvili, but was largely depopulated as a result of Ottoman inroads.

After the Russian annexation of Georgia, the Borjomi area began to revitalize. The toponym &quot;Borjomi&quot; is first recorded in the 1810s. The town and its surroundings were placed under the Russian military authorities. Borjomi began receiving soldiers in the 1820s. Buildings and baths began going up in the 1830s. Early in the 1840s, when the Russian Viceroy of the Caucasus Yevgeny Golovin brought his daughter down to partake of the cure, he expedited the official transfer of the waters from the military to civil authorities. The viceroy Mikhail Vorontsov, fascinated by local landscape and mineral waters, made Borjomi his summer residence and refurnished it with new parks. Its warm climate, mineral water springs, and forests made Borjomi a favorite summer resort for the aristocracy, and gave it its popular name of &quot;the pearl of Caucasus&quot;. In the 1860s, new hotels were built, and an administration for mineral waters was established. In 1871, Borjomi was bestowed upon the royal family member, Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolayvich, then the viceroy of the Caucasus. In the 1890s, Mikhail’s son, Nikolay, built a park and a chateau at Likani, at the western end of Borjomi. The bottled mineral waters began to be extensively exported. The town grew significantly at the expanse of Russian migrants and, in 1901, the number of ethnic Russian inhabitants (2,031) outstripped the native Georgians (1,424) for the first time.

Following the Red Army invasion of Georgia in 1921, the Soviet regime confiscated all aristocratic mansions and turned them into sanatoria, frequented by the Communist party elite. Despite significant damage caused by a flood on April 18, 1968, Borjomi continued to grow throughout the Soviet era. The post-Soviet years of political and economic crisis hindered development of the area, but it remained a popular destination for internal tourism. In the 2000s, a growing government and private investment into tourism and municipal infrastructure helped Borjomi recover from a decade of decay.

Borjomi, together with Bakuriani, was named by Georgia as an applicant city for the 2014 Winter Olympics on June 22, 2005, but it was eliminated as a candidate by the International Olympic Committee on June 22, 2006.

== Resort ==
Borjomi is a balneological and climatic resort. During the Soviet times it had the status of a union resort. According to the relief and microclimate peculiarities Borjomi has several districts, of which Likani, Papa and Plateau are particularly favorable for treatment. The main treatment of the resort is mineral water used for drinking and balneological procedures.

Other treatment factors in Borjomi are climatotherapy, mud treatment and more. The best time for climatotherapy is June–October. Medical indications: chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, liver and biliary tract, alteration of substances, some diseases of the cardiovascular system. The season lasts all year.

Borjomi-Kharagauli Protected Areas includes 6 districts – Borjomi, Kharagauli, Akhaltsikhe, Adigeni, Khashuri and Baghdati. There are administrative and visitors centers of the national park in Borjomi and Kharagauli.

<text>Two Planets (, lit. &quot;On Two Planets&quot;, 1897) is an influential science fiction novel by Kurd Lasswitz, postulating intelligent life on Mars. It was first published in hardcover by Felber in two volumes in 1897; there have been many editions since, including abridgements by the author&#x27;s son Erich Lasswitz (Cassianeum, 1948) and Burckhardt Kiegeland and Martin Molitor (Verlag Heinrich Scheffler, 1969). The 1948 abridgement, with &quot;incidental parts&quot; of the text taken from the 1969 version, was the basis of the first translation into English by Hans H. Rudnick, published in hardcover by Southern Illinois University Press in 1971. A paperback edition followed from Popular Library in 1976. The story covers topics like colonization, mutually assured destruction and clash of civilizations many generations before these topics came into politics.

==Summary==
A group of Arctic explorers seeking the North Pole find a Martian base there. The Martians can only operate in a polar region not because of climatic requirements, but because their spacecraft cannot withstand the rotation of the Earth at other latitudes. The aliens resemble Earth people in every respect except that they have much larger eyes, with which they can express more emotions. Their name for the inhabitants of Earth is &quot;the small-eyed ones&quot;. Lasswitz&#x27;s Martians are highly advanced, and initially peaceable; they take some of the explorers back with them to visit Mars dominated by canals. The Martian society seems to be enlightened, peaceful and highly advanced at first, but later the explorers learn about a plan to colonize Earth for farming solar power. In the following years, Mars subdues with ease every major government on Earth by force and diplomacy and promises to bring peace, education and prosperity for all. The situations start to look a lot like European colonization of third world countries before. Only parts of North America stay mostly independent for their low population density in the late 19th century. Over time, the Martian colonists become more arrogant towards the general population, which leads to uprising and atrocities from both sides with no chance of winning for the technologically inferior people from Earth, who form an organized planet-wide underground movement which operates from the shadows, steals technologies and unites the world in a final push against the Martians. In the final confrontation, both sides are faced with no way of winning the conflict as both sides have the power to annihilate the opposing infrastructure but not the opposing armies. In the end, an uneasy truce is made and honest talks start, giving Earth more freedom but still changed forever.

==Mars as depicted by Lasswitz==
Lasswitz hewed closely to the description by the astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli of Martian channels (&quot;canali&quot;), and even closer to that of Percival Lowell, who viewed them as actual canals engineered by intelligent beings. Lasswitz&#x27;s depiction is more reflective of the views of these astronomers than those of other science fiction stories of the era dealing with the planet, including H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;, Edwin Lester Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation&quot; and Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27;s tales of Barsoom, all of which were all written in the wake of Lasswitz&#x27;s book.

==Literary significance==
This novel was popular in the Germany of its day. Wernher von Braun and Walter Hohmann were inspired by reading it as children just as Robert H. Goddard was by reading &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. While there was no English translation before 1971, Everett F. Bleiler notes that it likely influenced American genre SF via Hugo Gernsback: &quot;Hugo Gernsback would have been saturated in Lasswitz&#x27;s work, and Gernsback&#x27;s theoretical position of technologically based liberalism and many of his little scientific crotchets resemble ideas in Lasswitz&#x27;s work.&quot;

==Reception==
Theodore Sturgeon, reviewing that 1971 translation for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, found &quot;Two Planets&quot; &quot;curious and fascinating . . . full of quaint dialogue, heroism, decorous lovemaking, and gorgeous gadgetry.&quot; Bleiler noted that the translated text was severely abridged, losing 40% of the original text; although the quality of the translation was good, he characterized the abridgment as &quot;a bad emasculation . . . This loss of detail results in a skeletization that omits important background and weakens motivations and plot connections. Lester del Rey similarly dismissed the 1971 translation as a bowdlerization&quot; which is &quot;bad scholarship, . . . unfair to readers [and] grossly unfair to Lasswitz.&quot; Del Rey noted that the translation was based on a 1948 abridgment prepared by the author&#x27;s son, with other modifications made by the translator.

<text>William Healy Sullivan (October 12, 1922 – October 11, 2013) was an American Foreign Service career officer who served as ambassador to Laos from 1964 to 1969, the Philippines from 1973 to 1977, and Iran from 1977 to 1979.

==Early life and career==
Sullivan was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, and graduated from Brown University as salutatorian and Class Orator of the class of 1943. His senior address was on America&#x27;s duty to &quot;aid in repairing not only the damage suffered by our Allies, but also that sustained by our enemies.&quot; After graduation, he entered the Navy and served as a gunnery officer on a destroyer, the &quot;USS Hambleton&quot;. The &quot;Hambleton&quot; escorted North Atlantic convoys, and served off North Africa and Italy before participating in the D-Day invasion of Normandy and the invasion of Okinawa. He had the senior watch on the &quot;Hambleton&quot; when it entered Yokohama harbor for the Japanese surrender.

After obtaining a joint graduate degree from Harvard University and the Fletcher School at Tufts University under the GI Bill, Sullivan joined the Foreign Service and was posted to Bangkok, Thailand. His subsequent assignments were to Calcutta, India, Tokyo, Japan, Naples and Rome, Italy, and The Hague, the Netherlands.

His habit of speaking his mind with force and candor grated on more than one superior, and for years he languished in the lower grades. Then, in the Kennedy administration, he was assigned to the office of W. Averell Harriman, the Assistant Secretary for the Far East. Harriman, no admirer of blandness, immediately recognized his abilities.

Sullivan served as Harriman&#x27;s deputy at Geneva negotiations about the future of Laos in 1961 and during the Cuban Missile Crisis. When the Vietnam War heated up, he served briefly as deputy chief of mission to the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

His nephew is former United States Deputy Secretary of State and former United States Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan.

==Ambassador to Laos==

In 1964, Sullivan began his tenure as Ambassador to Laos. Pursuant to an order by President John F. Kennedy, all U.S. military operations in Laos were under the direct supervision of the Ambassador. As Ambassador to Laos during Project 404, and he also personally directed the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh trail. This civilian control and the restriction on military operations rankled the military. 

He was also involved in Lima Site 85 in Laos: &quot;...Major Richard Secord, who was responsible for the security of Lima Site 85, was concerned about the safety of the unarmed U.S. Air Force technicians working there dressed as civilians. He requested Green Berets be assigned as on-site security. Sullivan turned down the request, repeatedly insisting the &quot;civilian personnel&quot; at Lima Site 85 should not be armed, but Secord decided to equip the technicians with weapons. M16 rifles, fragmentation grenades, concussion grenades, and other small arms were then brought in. Secord said that given the site&#x27;s meager defenses, he felt the site could not be held against a serious assault. Secord&#x27;s fears were justified, as USAF reconnaissance aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 revealed that the paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were obviously approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road construction activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected Dien Bien Phu in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos. Realizing the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) would try to destroy the installation, Secord advised the U.S. Embassy in Vientiane to evacuate all U.S. personnel. However, high-ranking U.S. officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped save the lives of U.S. pilots every day it remained operational. 

After he left Laos, Sullivan returned to Washington to coordinate the U.S. participation in the Paris Peace Talks. Thereafter, he was appointed Ambassador to the Philippines. South Vietnam fell while he was in the Philippines, and Sullivan orchestrated the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people through that nation. He was able to convince President Marcos to permit the fleeing South Vietnamese navy to land, despite a demand from the new Communist Vietnamese government for its return, by arguing that the ships were in fact U.S. property after the fall of the South Vietnamese government, as a result of the terms of their sale to that state.

==Ambassador to Iran==
Sullivan next served as Ambassador to Iran, arriving just before President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s visit to the Iran in December 1977. In the 1970s, America had extremely close military and economic links with Iran. 

As demonstrations increased in scale, Sullivan came into conflict with National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski over a resolution that would be acceptable to American interests. Sullivan felt that compromise with the demonstrators and the Ayatollah Khomeini was necessary, while Brzezinski favored strong, unconditional support for the Shah of Iran and Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar. Although Brzezinski got his way, the demonstrators prevailed. On November 9, 1978, Sullivan cabled Washington that it might be necessary to consider policy options if the military proved unable to assure the shah&#x27;s continuance in power and the shah should depart from Iran. This telegram, titled &quot;Thinking the Unthinkable,&quot; highlighted a major shift in support of the shah&#x27;s position in Iran. Previous information had suggested that the shah would be able to make it through the demonstrations and last at least another decade. In the telegram, Sullivan comments on how total support for the shah has become increasingly unlikely and that options not considered relevant to the Carter administration may had to be taken in order to preserve the United States&#x27; interests in the region. The telegram would make its way to Jimmy Carter, who in response concluded that Sullivan may not be capable of saving the shah&#x27;s regime and considered firing him. In January 1979, the White House instructed Sullivan to inform the shah that the U.S. government felt he should leave the country.

On February 1, 1979, the exiled Khomeini returned to Tehran. Days later, with Tehran in revolution and all organs of state essentially nonexistent, Under Secretary of State David D. Newsom called from the White House Situation Room with a question for Sullivan: &quot;The National Security Advisor (Brzezinski) has asked for your view of the possibility of a coup d&#x27;état by the Iranian military to take over from the Bakhtiar government, which is clearly faltering.&quot;

Sullivan allegedly replied, &quot;Tell Brzezinski to fuck off.&quot;

&quot;That&#x27;s not a very helpful comment,&quot; Newsom noted.

&quot;You want it translated into Polish?&quot; Sullivan hung up.

On February 14, 1979, the U.S. Embassy in Teheran was overrun by several different armed groups. The Embassy staff was briefly taken hostage, but later released to the caretaker Iranian government. This crisis, which predated the larger Iran Hostage Crisis by nine months, became sarcastically known as the &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Open House&quot; owing to the date on which it occurred.

Sullivan wrote in his autobiography: &quot;I had recommended that we accept the fact that a revolution was in progress and seek to use our not inconsiderable influence to steer its success toward its more moderate protagonists.&quot; This view, however, was not shared by Washington, and Sullivan was recalled in March 1979. Shortly after, on April 1, 1979, Iran officially became an Islamic Republic.

After Sullivan left Iran, the Embassy drew down to a skeleton staff, under the direction of Chargé d&#x27;Affaires Bruce Laingen, who later became one of 52 Americans held hostage by militant Iranian students. 

He headed the American Assembly at Columbia University, which had been briefly headed by General Dwight Eisenhower before he was elected President, from 1979 to 1986. In 1981, Sullivan published &quot;Mission to Iran&quot;, a memoir of his time as ambassador. His autobiography, &quot;Obbligato: Notes on a Foreign Service Career&quot;, was published in 1984.

==Later career==
He later served on the boards of the Lincoln Center, the International Center, and the U.S.–Vietnam Trade Council.

In 1988 he received an overture to begin steps towards U.S.–Vietnam normalization from his former North Vietnamese negotiations counterpart Nguyen Co Thach, who had become Vietnam&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Sullivan first traveled back to Vietnam in May 1989 to meet with Minister Thach, founded the U.S.–Vietnam Trade Council, and from then continued to work on steps towards the normalization.

Following retirement, he lived a quiet life in Cuernavaca, Mexico, and later, Washington, D.C.

Sullivan died on October 11, 2013, one day before his 91st birthday. He is survived by four children and six grandchildren.

<text>Anderston (, ) is an area of Glasgow, Scotland. It is on the north bank of the River Clyde and forms the south western edge of the city centre. Established as a village of handloom weavers in the early 18th century, Anderston was an independent burgh of barony from 1824 until it was incorporated into the City of Glasgow in 1846.

The district is served by Anderston railway station. It is bordered by Charing Cross to the north, Blythswood Hill to the east and Finnieston to the west.

==Foundation of Anderston==

The land on which the present day district of Anderston stands was once known as the Bishop&#x27;s Forest. These lands, situated to the west of medieval Glasgow, were granted to the Bishop of Glasgow by King James II of Scotland in 1450. The lands of Stobcross, which occupied part of this area, were the property of the Anderson family from the mid-16th century, and here they built their mansion, Stobcross House. Tradition has it that the name came from a wooden cross or ‘stob’ which marked the spot. Stobcross House was demolished in 1875 to make way for Queen&#x27;s Dock.

Anderston was originally an unproductive section of the Stobcross Estate which was feued out for weavers&#x27; cottages in 1725 by James Anderson of Stobcross House. It was named &quot;Anderson Town&quot; in his honour, later becoming &quot;Anderston&quot;. The fledgling village of Anderston began close to Gushet Farm, which became Anderston Cross and today is the site of the Kingston Bridge which carries the M8 motorway over the River Clyde. Ownership of the village changed in 1735 when it was taken over by John Orr. In those days Anderston had bleachfields down by the river and Main Street consisted of weavers&#x27; cottages along both sides. As business and trade increased so did the size of Anderston. Finnieston, a nearby village was established in 1768 by Matthew Orr, named for the Rev. John Finnie, the Orr family tutor and Finnieston weavers were allowed to become members of Anderston&#x27;s weavers society from 1774. From its origins as a weavers&#x27; village, the area became an industrial centre with the growth of Glasgow&#x27;s cotton industry and other industries including glassmaking and pottery.

By 1794, the population of the village of Anderston was around 3,900. In the countryside surrounding the village there were many country estates such as Hydepark and Lancefield. These would later be commemorated in the street names of Anderston as the area expanded and became urbanised in the 19th century. The eastern boundary of Anderston was for many years marked by Royalty Stones number 208 and 209, on the north and south sides of the present Argyle Street. The Blythswood Burn had originally flowed through the site, and had marked the eastern boundary of the Stobcross lands. The Royalty Stones stood on the site from around 1782 until they were removed during the comprehensive development which took place in the area in the 1960s and 1970s.

By the late 18th century, Anderston was a thriving community, with its population employed mostly in weaving and related industries such as bleaching, dyeing and printing. Other industries were also thriving by this period, such as the Delftfield Pottery (established 1748), the Anderston Brewery (1760s) and the Verreville Glassworks (1776). The area&#x27;s first church, the Anderston Relief Church in Heddle Place, was erected in 1770.

The area of Anderston now known as Cranstonhill was known in ancient times as &quot;Drumother Hill&quot;. It became corrupted to Drumover Hill, the reason for this being a myth that it was the place where vagabonds were escorted to, to the tune of the &quot;Rogues&#x27; March&quot;, when they were drummed out of town. Alexander Peden prophesied in the 17th century that this hill would one day be the site of the &#x27;Cross of Glasgow.&#x27; At that time, the hill stood in open countryside a few miles from the Burgh of Glasgow.

==19th century==

In the early 19th century, Henry Houldsworth, a cotton mill owner, established a spinning mill on Cheapside Street which was steam powered. In 1809, the Cranstonhill reservoir was built which supplied the village with a direct source of water from the River Clyde. The town was made a Burgh of Barony in 1824 when Anderston&#x27;s population stood at around 10,000, The first Town Council was elected, with Henry Houldsworth being chosen as the first Provost of Anderston. The council also included three Bailies, eleven councillors and a Treasurer. The Burgh motto was the Latin &quot;Alter Alterius Auxilio Veget&quot;, which roughly translates as &#x27;the one flourishes by the help of the other.&#x27; However, Anderston&#x27;s status as an independent Burgh would not last long. In 1846 it was incorporated into the City of Glasgow. The last Provost of Anderston was Henry Houldsworth&#x27;s son, John.

During the rest of the 19th century, the area continued to grow and new industries developed, such as shipbuilding, iron-founding, tool manufacturing and engineering. The close proximity to the docks on the River Clyde meant that Anderston also became an ideal place for the establishment of whisky bonds, grain stores and timber yards. This period also saw the establishment of the famous Cranstonhill (established 1865) and Bilsland Bakeries (1882). Thomas Lipton opened his first shop in Stobcross Street in 1871.

The increase of industry in the area brought a large number of people from the Scottish Lowlands. There was also a large Irish immigrant population moving to the area and by 1831 about a quarter of Anderston&#x27;s population were Irish. The rapid development of industry in the area also led to a demand for working class housing, and most of the Anderston area was built in the late 19th century, comprising the solid stone tenement buildings which are synonymous with Glasgow. This was also the period when many of Anderston&#x27;s churches were built to serve the growing community. These included St Mark&#x27;s Lancefield (1850), St Patrick&#x27;s RC Church (1850) Anderston Parish Church (1865).

By the close of the 19th century shipping and associated industries had taken over the area and spread to fill the parkland beside the Clyde and the area was densely populated and characterised by back-street workshops and closely packed tenements.

==20th century==

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, even though it had been a part of Glasgow since 1846, Anderston remained in many respects like a large village within a city. There was a strong sense of local identity (which still survives to this day), with the area being well-served and self-contained in regard to shops, cinemas and places of employment. Like many other similar areas of Glasgow, relatives and friends tended to live locally (often in the same building), and everyone knew everyone else in the area, to a large extent. But this situation would change in the post-war era.

Several buildings in Anderston on Finnieston Street, Hill Street, Hydepark Street and Lancefield Street were destroyed during air raids in May 1941.

After the Second World War, there was a determination by national and local government that something had to be done about the bad housing and overcrowding of the inner city areas which existed in most of the major cities in Britain. The Bruce Report of 1945 led to the concept of &#x27;Comprehensive Development&#x27; which meant the total demolition of areas of sub standard housing and slums in the city, so that new, planned communities could be built on the cleared ground. In total, 20 Comprehensive Development Areas were designated in Glasgow, with one of them comprising a large part of Anderston.

Although Anderston&#x27;s housing problems were no worse than many other areas of Glasgow, Anderston was made an area for priority treatment as the need to improve Glasgow&#x27;s road network had led to the plans for building a motorway through the city. The route of this motorway was to go through Anderston Cross, the traditional heart of the community, and the plan for the comprehensive development of the area was approved in 1961. The new Anderston would therefore be divided into three zones; a &quot;Commercial Zone&quot; devoted to office space and commerce on the eastern fringe of the city centre, and bordered on the west by the new ring road, a &quot;Residential Zone&quot; consisting of new housing estates to the immediate east and an &quot;Industrial Zone&quot; to the south east.
The work on the road network and the demolition of housing progressed throughout the 1960s. By the following decade, the new Anderston bore little resemblance to the old area. The high density housing and streets full of tenements had been swept away, and most of the residents had been rehoused in places such as Knightswood, Easterhouse, Cumbernauld, Drumchapel and East Kilbride. In 1951, the population had stood at 31,902; by 1971, it had dropped to 9,265 as a result of redevelopment.

There were two major fires in Anderston in the 1960s. The first occurred in March 1960 on Cheapside Street when a whisky bond caught fire and exploded. The explosion occurred over an hour after the initial fire and caused part of the building to collapse on top of three fire engines and trapped firemen beneath rubble. Fourteen firemen and five salvage corps workers were killed. The second fire occurred in November 1968 in a factory on James Watt Street. The fire trapped twenty-two workers who could not get through the windows which were barred.

Many of the tenement blocks in the area were demolished in the 1970s to make way for the M8 motorway and Kingston Bridge and Anderston Cross was replaced by the Anderston Centre. The idea was not a success, and by the 1980s the centre&#x27;s many covered underpasses and service roads had become a notorious red light district, with prostitution a major activity in both Anderston and neighbouring Blythswood Hill in the evening.

==21st century==

However, with the exponential growth of Glasgow&#x27;s flourishing new financial district, by the turn of the 21st century, Anderston&#x27;s fortunes seemed to be improving. New ultra-modern office developments, international hotels and new residential buildings have sprung up, which have improved the look and reputation of the area markedly. After original plans to demolish them, the three tower blocks of the Anderston Centre were saved in favour of refurbishment, after they transferred to the Glasgow West Housing Association.

As of 2010 the blocks were being externally reclad to match the design of private developments going up adjacent. In 2011, work began on demolishing much of the original 1960s housing estate to the east of the motorway, including the Shaftesbury tower, and restoring portions of the original street plan including Argyle Street. The development, by Sanctuary Scotland, received multiple awards and also features a statue of Charles Rennie Mackintosh (designed by Andy Scott) as its centrepiece.

==Education==
Anderston Primary School (1973), a non-denominational state school, is located on Port Street in Anderston.

== History ==
Starting from 1842, small villages were established in the area of the Tietê River. In 1848 Manoel dos Santos Simões and his two sons, Manuel Leonel dos Santos and João Leonel dos Santos, established a farm in the parish of Botucatu. They named the farm &quot;Pederneiras&quot; after the large amount of flint stone in the area. In 1865, the settlement became part of the municipality of Lençóis Paulista. Four years later it became a parish with the name &quot;São Sebastião de Alegria&quot;. Coffee plantations led to growth of the settlement, and in 1891 it became a separate municipality. In 1895, the town&#x27;s name was changed back into &quot;Pederneiras&quot;.

Most of the residents from Pederneiras used to complain because they had to cross long distances to solve their Judicial matters in Lençóis Paulista only (another municipality located around 35 km distance), due to the Judicial district was settled there. Trying to soften the problem, they changed it from Lençóis Paulista to Jaú (a closer municipality located around 25 km distance) in 1895. Only in 1928 they set the own Judicial district in Pederneiras Town.

The birthday of the municipality is featured by the festival called Nations&#x27;s Fair, where it is possible to find different kind of shows and different kind of dishes from different nationalities.

<doc id="1080388" wikidata="Q3211110" url="?curid=1080388" title="The Concept of Mind">
<text>The Concept of Mind is a 1949 book by philosopher Gilbert Ryle, in which the author argues that &quot;mind&quot; is &quot;a philosophical illusion hailing chiefly from René Descartes and sustained by logical errors and &#x27;category mistakes&#x27; which have become habitual.&quot;

The work has been cited as having &quot;put the final nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism,&quot; and has been seen as a founding document in the philosophy of mind, which received professional recognition as a distinct and important branch of philosophy only after 1950.

== Ghost in the machine ==
In the chapter &quot;Descartes&#x27; Myth&quot;, Ryle introduces &quot;the dogma of the Ghost in the machine&quot; to describe the philosophical concept of the mind as an entity separate from the body:I hope to prove that it is entirely false, and false not in detail but in principle. It is not merely an assemblage of particular mistakes. It is one big mistake and a mistake of a special kind. It is, namely, a category-mistake.

==Critique of Cartesian dualism==
Ryle rejects Descartes&#x27; theory of the relation between mind and body, on the grounds that it approaches the investigation of mental processes as if they could be isolated from physical processes. In order to demonstrate how this theory may be misleading, he explains that knowing how to perform an act skillfully may not only be a matter of being able to reason practically but may also be a matter of being able to put practical reasoning into action. Practical actions may not necessarily be produced by highly theoretical reasoning or by complex sequences of intellectual operations. The meaning of actions may not be explained by making inferences about hidden mental processes, but it may be explained by examining the rules that govern those actions.

According to Ryle, mental processes are merely intelligent acts. There are no mental processes that are distinct from intelligent acts. The operations of the mind are not merely represented by intelligent acts, they are the same as those intelligent acts. Thus, acts of learning, remembering, imagining, knowing, or willing are not merely clues to hidden mental processes or to complex sequences of intellectual operations, they are the way in which those mental processes or intellectual operations are defined. Logical propositions are not merely clues to modes of reasoning, they are those modes of reasoning.

The rationalist theory that there is a &quot;transformation into&quot; physical acts of some purely mental faculty of &quot;Will&quot; or &quot;Volition&quot; is therefore a misconception because it mistakenly assumes that a mental act could be and is distinct from a physical act, or even that a mental &quot;world&quot; could be and is distinct from the physical world. This theory of the separability of mind and body is described by Ryle as &quot;the dogma of the ghost in the machine.&quot; He explains that the workings of the mind as it governs the body are neither an independent nor a distinct mechanism, that there is no entity called &quot;Mind&quot; inside a mechanical apparatus called &quot;the body&quot;, but that the workings of the mind may be better conceptualized as the actions of the body.

Cartesian theory holds that mental acts determine physical acts and that volitional acts of the body must be caused by volitional acts of the mind. This theory, according to Ryle, is &quot;the myth of the ghost in the machine.&quot;

There &quot;is&quot; no contradiction between saying that an action is governed by physical laws and saying that the same action is governed by principles of reasoning. The motives of observable actions are &quot;&quot; and &quot;dispositions&quot;; these explain why behaviors occur, and not some purely mental process. For example, the disposition to want or not to want something is not explained by an intellectual motive for that thing. The disposition to want something is explained by &quot;the behaviors that are involved&quot; in wanting that thing. Thus, the mind does consist of abilities and dispositions that do explain behaviors, for example the learning, remembering, knowing, feeling, or willing behaviors. However, personal abilities and dispositions are not the same as mental processes or events. To refer to abilities or dispositions as if they were purely mental occurrences is to make a basic kind of category mistake.

The nature of a person&#x27;s motives may be defined by the actions and reactions of that person in various circumstances or situations. The nature of a person&#x27;s motives in a particular situation may not necessarily be determined by any hidden mental processes or intellectual acts within that person. Motives may be revealed or explained by a person&#x27;s behavior in a situation.

Ryle criticizes the theory that the mind is a place where mental images are apprehended, perceived, or remembered. Sensations, thoughts, and feelings do not belong to a mental world which is distinct from the physical world. Knowledge, memory, imagination, and other abilities or dispositions do not reside &quot;within&quot; the mind as if the mind were a space in which these dispositions could be placed or located. Furthermore, dispositions are not the same as behavioral actions, but actions may be explained by dispositions.

Dispositions are neither visible nor hidden, because they are not in the same logical category as behavioral actions. Dispositions are not mental processes or intellectual acts, they are propensities which explain various modes of behavior. Perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and feelings may be understood as observable behaviors which have various modes of production.

Ryle admits that his approach to the theory of mind is behavioristic in being opposed to the theory that there are hidden mental processes that are distinct from observable behaviors. His approach is based on the view that actions such as thinking, remembering, feeling, and willing are revealed by modes of behavior or by dispositions to modes of behavior. At the same time, however, he criticizes both Cartesian theory and behaviorist theory for being overly mechanistic. While Cartesian theory may insist that hidden mental events produce the behavioral responses of the conscious individual, behaviorism may insist that stimulus-response mechanisms produce the behavioral responses of the conscious individual. Ryle concludes that both Cartesian theory and behaviorist theory may be too rigid and mechanistic to provide us with an adequate understanding of the concept of mind.

== Category mistakes ==
As a linguistic philosopher, a significant portion of Ryle&#x27;s argument is devoted to analyzing what he perceives as philosophical errors based in conceptual use of language. His critique of Cartesian dualism refers to it as a &quot;category mistake&quot;. Category mistakes, such as the ones Ryle points out, are made by people who do not know how to properly wield the concepts with which they are working. Their puzzles arise from the inability to use certain items in human language. A much-cited example is of a foreign visitor being shown round Oxford (which has no campus) and after having been shown colleges, libraries, laboratories and playing fields asks in puzzlement &quot;But where is the university?&quot; The answer is, of course, all of these.

The theoretically interesting category mistakes are those made by people who are perfectly competent to apply concepts, at least in the situations with which they are familiar, but are still liable in their abstract thinking to relocate those concepts to logical types to which they do not belong.
The dualist doctrine establishes a between mind and body. At the language level, the mental properties are logical negations (in the Aristotelian sense) of the physical properties. So they belong, in accordance with the concept of category, to the same logical types, given that the expressions that are used for the descriptions of mental events are always mere negatives of the expressions used for the descriptions of material events. Ryle then says that such use implies a &#x27;categorical mistake&#x27; for the descriptions of mental events that do not properly belong to the categories used for describing the corporeal events. Hence, &#x27;mind&#x27; and &#x27;matter&#x27; cannot be the polar opposites that Dualism suggests. Ryle writes that this would be comparable to claiming that &quot;She came home in floods of tears&quot; and &quot;She came home in a sedan chair&quot; (from the sentence &quot;Miss Bolo came home in a flood of tears and a sedan chair,&quot; a zeugmatic sentence from Dickens) to be polar opposites. Such mistakes are, from the Rylean standpoint, the dogma of the mental ghost in the corporeal machine. Then, dualist doctrines are mythic in an analytical sense.

==Antecedents==
Ryle builds on the work of philosophers Ludwig Wittgenstein and Arthur Schopenhauer, among others. According to Bryan Magee, the central thesis of &quot;Concept of Mind&quot; and the essentials of its subsidiary theses were derived from Schopenhauer, whose works Ryle had read as a student, then largely forgotten. Ryle, who believed that he had expounded an original theory, did not realize what he had done until someone pointed it out to him after the book was published.

==Reception==

Ryle has been characterized as an &quot;ordinary language&quot; philosopher, for which the book&#x27;s style of writing has attracted comment.

Stuart Hampshire remarked in a review in &quot;Mind&quot; that:There is only one property which I can discover to be common to Professor Ryle and Immanuel Kant; in both cases the style is the philosopher - as Kant thought and wrote in dichotomies, Professor Ryle writes in epigrams. There are many passages in which the argument simply consists of a succession of epigrams, which do indeed effectively explode on impact, shattering conventional trains of thought, but which, like most epigrams, leave behind among the debris in the reader&#x27;s mind a trail of timid doubts and qualifications.John Searle, who has often said that no great work of philosophy contains many footnotes and that philosophical quality varies inversely with the number of bibliographical references, considers the absence of footnotes in &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; as a sign of its quality.

Iris Murdoch has compared &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; to Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;Being and Nothingness&quot; (1943), with the view that English analytic philosophy shares the same general orientation as continental philosophy. Ryle has been interpreted by David Stannard as maintaining that the psychoanalytic idea of the unconscious is rooted in the Cartesian conception of a body-mind dichotomy and as such is one version of the &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot; fallacy. According to Stannard, Ryle views the dogma as a logical error based on a category mistake.

Richard Webster praises Ryle&#x27;s clarity and strength of argument, but suggests that while his arguments effectively dissolve the mind-body problem, they have failed to bring about a revolution in human knowledge. Webster attributes this to the fact that Ryle&#x27;s case that subjective aspects of experience such as sensation, memory, consciousness and sense of self are not the essence of &quot;mind&quot; has not been universally accepted by contemporary philosophers, neuroscientists, and psychologists. Webster believes that Ryle&#x27;s willingness to accept the characterization of &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot; as behaviorist misrepresents its more nuanced position, writing that Ryle&#x27;s acceptance of that description is not harmless, as Ryle himself suggested. Webster stresses that Ryle does not deny the reality of what are often called internal sensations and thoughts, but simply rejects the idea that they belong to a realm logically distinct from and independent of the external realm of ordinary human behaviour.

The book&#x27;s style of writing was commented on more negatively by Herbert Marcuse, who observes that the way in which Ryle follows his presentation of &quot;Descartes&#x27; Myth&quot; as the &quot;official doctrine&quot; about the relation between body and mind with a preliminary demonstration of its &quot;absurdity&quot; which evokes &quot;John Doe, Richard Roe, and what they think about the &#x27;Average Taxpayer&#x27;&quot; shows a style that moves &quot;between the two poles of pontificating authority and easy-going chumminess,&quot; something Marcuse finds to be characteristic of philosophical behaviorism.

<doc id="1080393" wikidata="Q1431771" url="?curid=1080393" title="Battle of Glenmalure">
<text>The Battle of Glenmalure () took place in Ireland on 25 August 1580 during the Desmond Rebellions. A Catholic army of united Irish clans from the Wicklow Mountains led by Fiach MacHugh O&#x27;Byrne and James Eustace, 3rd Viscount Baltinglass of the Pale, defeated an English army under Arthur Grey, 14th Baron Grey de Wilton, at Clan O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s mountain stronghold of Glenmalure.

== Background ==
Grey had landed in Ireland with reinforcements from England in mid-August; his total forces numbering over 2,000 men, the largest English army sent to Ireland in decades. The presence of such a large retinue undoubtedly dissuaded many would-be rebels from joining O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s side. Despite this, Grey was inexperienced in waging war on Irish terrain and had been previously out of active military service for twenty years. Grey had also received little information on how Ireland was to be governed, even after being appointed Lord Deputy, and so his task was seen as a purely military affair. 

O&#x27;Byrne, Baltinglass, along with their O&#x27;Toole allies, simply withdrew in the face of a much larger military force and re-established themselves in Glenmalure. From there, they dispatched a message to Grey seeking protection. However, Grey had been under strict instructions not to give any such protection or pardoning, and perceived this message as indicative of the arrogant behaviour of the Irish rebels.

On 18 August, Grey moved his forces to Naas where he collected guides and made plans to attack the rebels. Grey intended to march around the Wicklow Mountains and thus hit O&#x27;Byrne&#x27;s forces from the south-east. However, when the rebels were nowhere to be found, Grey marched his forces ever deeper into the mountains; the route being dictated by the worsening local terrain that was funneling Grey&#x27;s men into a narrow valley. By this point, O&#x27;Byrne had become fully aware of the English troop movements, largely due to defectors from Grey&#x27;s Kildare allies and from the large mass of soldiers dressed in scarlet and blue coats rummaging through the narrow path.

== Battle ==
When what appeared to be the vanguard of the Irish rebels presented itself before Grey, he ordered his forces to engage immediately, against the advice of some of his more experienced Kildare allies. They, along with Grey&#x27;s force of cavalry, occupied a position on a nearby hill and did not play an active role in the subsequent battle. The English vanguard, commanded by Colonel George Moore, pursued the Irish rebels into the glen - a dense valley bisected by a four-mile-long river with steep sides and covered in dense foliage, rising in places as high as 2,000 feet. The English fought an advancing skirmish with the Irish as they were drawn deeper and deeper into the glen, whose terrain by now had become horrendous, marked by rocks, bogs, and wood. In an effort to gain higher and more defensible ground, or possibly believing his troops had become vulnerable to an ambush, Colonel Moore advanced his troops up the northern slope of the glen.

While climbing the steep slopes of the valley, the inexperienced English soldiers were ambushed by the Irish who hid in the woods. The English were sniped at for a long period of time before their discipline collapsed and they turned and fled down the valley. It was at this point that most of their casualties occurred, as the Irish left their cover and fell upon the English with swords, spears, and axes. Dozens of English soldiers were cut down by the pursuing Irish as they tried to escape the field. The remaining English had to fight a rearguard action for several miles until they reached the town of Rathdrum. Only the presence of Grey&#x27;s cavalry and his rearguard prevented the total annihilation of the English forces.

== Aftermath ==
Irish sources state that around 800 English soldiers were killed. English sources put their losses lower at 360 dead. While it is certainly possible that the English sources had ignored to include the casualties of their Irish allies. English losses included Peter Carew, cousin of his namesake colonist who had made claims to, and won, large tracts of land in southern Ireland. The remainder of the English force retreated to lowland Wicklow and from there to Dublin. However, the following year, most of the Irish rebel lords, including O&#x27;Byrne, accepted terms of surrender offered by the Crown. The exception was Baltinglass, who fled for France.

==In popular culture==
The battle is commemorated in the folk song &quot;Follow me up to Carlow&quot;.

<doc id="1080402" wikidata="Q379572" url="?curid=1080402" title="Ottavio Bottecchia">
<text>Ottavio Bottecchia (; 1 August 1894 – 15 June 1927) was an Italian cyclist and the first Italian winner of the Tour de France.

He was found injured and unconscious by a roadside and died a few days later; the exact circumstances of his accident remain a mystery.

== Early life ==
Bottecchia was born as the eighth child of a poor family of nine children. He went to school for just a year, first working as a shoemaker, then as a bricklayer. His father left to find work in Germany. Bottecchia later married and had three children.

Despite being a convinced socialist with anti-Fascist convictions, Bottecchia joined the Bersaglieri corps of the Italian army during the first world war. For four years he ferried messages and supplies on the Austrian front with a special folding bicycle. During the conflict he contracted malaria and also had to evade capture several times. Bottecchia endured a gas attack on 3 November 1917 after the battle of Caporetto while providing covering fire for retreating forces. Near Sequals he was captured, but escaped while being marched into captivity at night. After returning to Italian lines, he twice conducted reconnaissance sorties into Austrian-held areas, which by now included his home region of Colle Umberto. Bottecchia was later awarded a bronze medal for valor.

After the end of hostilities Bottecchia moved to France in 1919 to work as a builder, which later led to insinuations that he was not Italian – slurs that were compounded by his strong regional dialect. Bottecchia&#x27;s family continued to struggle with poverty, and his youngest daughter died in 1921 at the age of seven.

Bottecchia returned to Italy where he took up competitive cycling. He won the Giro del Piave, the Coppa della Vittoria, and the Duca D&#x27;Aosta in 1920 and the Coppe Gallo an Osimo, the Circuito del Piave and the Giro del Friuli in 1921.

== Professional career ==
Bottecchia became a professional cyclist in 1920. He was given a racing bicycle by Teodoro Carnielli, president of a cycling association, the Associazione Sportiva di Vittorio Veneto. Carnielli encouraged Bottecchia to join the Pordenone sport union.

In 1923 Bottecchia placed fifth in the 11th Giro d&#x27;Italia, the highest finish by an &#x27;isolate&#x27; (rider without a team). His position attracted the leading French rider, Henri Pélissier, who asked Bottecchia to join his professional team, Automoto-Hutchinson. Pélissier had just left the J. B. Louvet team after an internal row and had taken another rider, Honoré Barthélemy, with him. Automoto was a French motorcycle company that also sold its products in Italy. Automoto saw the chance not only of winning the Tour de France but of having a further Italian rider to stimulate foreign sales. Henri Pélissier said he had seen Bottecchia ride the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo and the team signed him.

The new recruit reported for duties with his new team in France, said the writer Pierre Chany, with a skin tanned like an old leather saddle and creases to his face deep enough to be scars. His clothing was ragged and his shoes so old that they no longer had any shape. His ears stuck out so far that the Tour organiser, Henri Desgrange referred to him as &quot;butterfly&quot;.
It was as a professional that Bottecchia learned to read, taught by his friend and training partner, Alfonso Piccin. Together they read the Italian sports daily, Gazzetta dello Sport, and clandestine anti-fascist pamphlets protesting at the rule of Benito Mussolini.

Bottecchia&#x27;s success for his new team included winning a stage in the 1923 Tour de France, where he also placed second overall. He led the Tour from Cherbourg after the second stage and wore the yellow jersey of leader as far as Nice. There he passed it on to Pélissier, who won with the prediction: &quot;Bottecchia will succeed me next year.&quot; Such was the reaction in Italy that the &quot;Gazetta dello Sport&quot; asked a lire from each of its readers to reward him. Mussolini was first to subscribe.

In 1924 Bottecchia won the first stage of the Tour and kept his lead to the end, the first Italian to win. He wore his yellow jersey all the way to Milan in the train – travelling third class to save money. 

Bottecchia won the Tour again in 1925 with the help of Lucien Buysse, who served as the first domestique in Tour history. Accused in 1924 of winning without trying, Bottecchia won the first, sixth, seventh and final stage.
He was never the same after that and dropped out, &quot;weeping like a child&quot;, during a thunderstorm in 1926. Buysse emerged the winner. The writer Bernard Chambaz said:

The unpleasant hand of destiny fell on his shoulders. It was as though the misery of his origins had caught up with him. Dark thoughts and a presentiment of the future haunted him. He abandoned the Tour of 1926 on a stage which those who were there described as apocalytpic because of the cold and the violence of the wind. He went home, unhappy. He no longer had the heart to train. He feared that he&#x27;d been &#x27;cut down by a bad illness&#x27;. He coughed and he ached in his back and his bronchial tubes. The following winter, he lost his younger brother, knocked down by a car.

== Death ==

On 23 May 1927 Ottavio&#x27;s brother, Giovanni, was riding his bike near Conegliano when a car struck and killed him. Ottavio returned to Italy from France because of the death. While back, he led the peloton at the Giro d&#x27;Italia on 2 June.

On 3 June 1927, a farmer outside the village of Peonis, near Bottecchia&#x27;s home, found him on the roadside. His skull was cracked, one collarbone and other bones broken. His bike lay some distance away on the verge and was undamaged. There were no skid marks to suggest a car had forced him off the road and no marks to the pedals or handlebar tape to suggest he had lost control.

Bottecchia was carried to an inn and laid on a table. A priest gave him the last rites. From there he was taken by cart to hospital in Gemona. He died there on 14 June, twelve days later, without regaining consciousness.

On the day of the incident, Bottecchia had risen at dawn and asked for a hot bath to be ready for him for when he would return in three hours. He rode to his friend Alfonso Piccini&#x27;s house to go training together as on other days. Piccini decided not to go and Bottecchia went to see another friend, Riccardo Zille. He had other things to do, however, so Bottecchia set out alone.

Theories abound about the circumstances of his death. Bernard Chambaz of &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; said:
Accident or assassination? The accident theory, favoured by justice, on the accounts of witnesses and a medical examination which also referred to several fractures, was based on an assumption of an illness, sunstroke and a fall. In fact, the inquiry was quickly closed. The theory suited everybody: the Mussolini régime, the presumed killer and even – it&#x27;s sad to say – the family, now sure of a large insurance payout.

Don Dantė Nigris, the priest who gave him the last rites, is said to have attributed the death to Fascists unhappy about Bottecchia&#x27;s more liberal leanings. However, an Italian dying from stab wounds on a New York waterfront claimed he had been employed as a hit man. He named a supposed godfather, although nobody of the name was ever found.

Much later, the farmer who had found Bottecchia said on his deathbed: &quot;I saw a man eating my grapes. He&#x27;d pushed through the vines and damaged them. I threw a rock to scare him, but it hit him. I ran to him and realised who it was. I panicked and dragged him to the roadside and left him. God forgive me!&quot;

== Bottecchia bicycles ==
In 1926, Bottecchia began working with frame-maker Teodoro Carnielli to manufacture racing bikes, taking advantage of his Tour de France knowledge. The business expanded under the Carnielli family after Bottecchia&#x27;s death. In 2006 more than 50,000 Bottechia bikes were sold in Europe.

== Literary relevance ==
Bottecchia is mentioned at the end of Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;.

<text>The Philadelphia KiXX was a professional indoor soccer team based in Philadelphia, USA. The team competed as an NPSL expansion franchise and then played in the Major Indoor Soccer League.

==History==
The team&#x27;s original owner was Ed Tepper, also president of Tepper Properties Inc, had been one of the co-founders of the original MISL. In 2001, the KiXX along with five other NPSL franchises founded the new Major Indoor Soccer League. They were originally sponsored by Oki Data Americas. The KiXX won the first MISL championship (2001–02 season) over the Milwaukee Wave 2 games to 1 (4–11, 11–4, 8–6) in the best of three game championship series. The KiXX also won the 2006–07 MISL championship defeating the Detroit Ignition 13–8 in a one-game championship. After the MISL folded in 2008, the KiXX announced that they had joined the National Indoor Soccer League for its inaugural season in 2008–09. The NISL took on the MISL moniker for its second season.

On March 2, 2010, KiXX goalkeeper Peter Pappas retired after playing his final match against the Baltimore Blast at the Liacouras Center. In honor of his years of dedication and spotless record the KiXX decided to retire the #22 jersey. Pappas spent 13 seasons with the KiXX. During that time he played in 416 matches, recording 5,399 saves and 230 wins. He was named Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) ‘Goalkeeper of the Year’ four times and an All-League selection eight times. Fellow long-term KiXX member Don D&#x27;Ambra also retired in 2010. He served as head coach of the KiXX from 2002 to 2010 and played 575 games, scoring 483 goals. In April 2010, D&#x27;Ambra was named the head coach of the Saint Joseph&#x27;s Hawks men&#x27;s soccer team.

The team went on hiatus after the conclusion of the 2009–10 season and did not return to play before the MISL folded as a league in 2014.

<text>Nobia AB () is a Swedish company which owns many European kitchen-related firms. In 2008 it was the largest producer of kitchen furniture in Europe.

Nobia was formed in 1996 by IK Partners (Formerly Industri Kapital) through a buyout from STORA (now Stora Enso). The company&#x27;s headquarters are in Stockholm, on whose stock exchange the sharebolag is listed. Nobia&#x27;s major regional, national and international brands are present in many European countries. The company specializes in custom built-in kitchens and generates part of its revenue through franchising. In 2003, there was a legal dispute between Nobia and the German kitchen manufacturer Nobilia due to the likelihood of confusion between the two names.

Since 2019, Jon Sintorn has been the CEO and Group President.

<doc id="1080428" wikidata="Q1381947" url="?curid=1080428" title="EverQuest II">
<text>EverQuest II is a 3D fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) originally developed and published by Sony Online Entertainment for Microsoft Windows PCs and released in November 2004. It is the sequel to the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;, released five years earlier, and features updated graphics and more streamlined gameplay compared to the previous entry, as well as an abundance of voice acting with contributions from actors such as Christopher Lee and Heather Graham. In February 2015, Sony Online Entertainment&#x27;s parent corporation Sony Computer Entertainment sold it to investment company Inception Acquisitions, where it continues to develop and publish the game under its new name, Daybreak Game Company.

The game is set in an alternate future 500 years after the events of the first &quot;EverQuest&quot;, and is meant to run alongside its predecessor without interfering with the original story. It features characters and locations from the original that have been altered by centuries of war and cataclysmic destruction. While the title did receive favorable reviews upon release, it was notably less influential to the genre than the previous installment, and it faced heavy competition from other MMORPGs, such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, which was released two weeks after &quot;EverQuest II&quot;. While originally subscription-based since its launch, a free-to-play version with its own dedicated server was released in July 2010 called EverQuest II Extended. In November 2011, the subscription service was cancelled in favor of making all remaining servers free-to-play with microtransactions as the revenue stream.

==Gameplay==
Within &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, each player creates a character to interact in the 3D, fictional world of Norrath. The character can adventure (complete quests, explore the world, kill monsters and gain treasures and experience) and socialize with other players. The game also has a &#x27;tradeskill&#x27; system that allows players to create items for in-game use. Players can make items such as spells, potions, armor and many other items. The player chooses their character&#x27;s race and type, which affects their abilities. Characters collect experience to advance in level. &quot;EverQuest II&quot; enables social interaction with other players through grouping and the creation of guilds. Like players, guilds can gain experience and levels, partially from players completing special tasks called Heritage quests, but primarily from guild-oriented quests and tasks called &quot;writs&quot;, and gaining guild experience by killing epic monsters. Higher guild levels open up special rewards unavailable to non-guilded characters, and cause certain other rewards to cost less. These rewards include housing options, mounts, house items, apparel, and special titles. Although &quot;EverQuest II&quot; focuses on player versus environment (PvE), dedicated player versus player (PvP) servers were added in February 2006. &quot;EverQuest II&quot; has a heavy focus on quests; more than 6,000 exist. The &quot;EverQuest II&quot; feature set has expanded since its release in 2004.

Players must choose a &#x27;race&#x27; when creating a character. The choice of races include human, barbarian, dwarf, erudite, ogre, iksar, troll, gnome, half elf, high elf, halfling, Vah Shir, wood elf and dark elf (which were available in the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;) along with new options such as the Kerra (a cat-person similar to the Vah Shir of the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;), the Ratonga (a rat-like people), the Sarnak (a dragon-like people) and the Fae and Arasai (fairy-like people). The Froglok race was originally locked until a special server-wide quest was completed to make them playable. Some races are restricted to certain starting cities, based on their alignment, but can turn traitor and move to the opposing city. There are four &quot;archetypes&quot; in &quot;EverQuest II&quot; - Fighter, Scout, Priest and Mage. When &quot;EverQuest 2&quot; was launched, a player chose the character&#x27;s archetype during the initial character creation and then chose a &#x27;class&#x27; at level 10 and a &#x27;sub-class&#x27; at level 20. This system was changed in 2006 so that a character&#x27;s final class is chosen at creation.

Acquisition of equipment is a major focus of character progression. &quot;EverQuest II&quot; has no experience loss or lost levels from dying. Upon death, characters respawn with their gear intact at specific revival locations, with a minor &quot;experience debt&quot; to be repaid. Gear is fully functional until its condition runs out after 10 consecutive deaths, and is repaired to 100% for a fee. Players can form groups of up to 6 players, or raids of up to 24 players (i.e., four groups). Monster encounters are classified into corresponding categories of difficulty, and tend to drop corresponding tiers of treasure. Player interaction is encouraged by integrated voice chat, a built-in mail system, global chat channels, and a global marketplace. A looking-for-group tool is provided for adventurers, and looking-for-work for crafters. &quot;EverQuest II&quot; has strong support for guilds. Each guild has an experience bar and earns guild levels (up to 150). The guild gains experience when its members perform tasks that earn city status. Higher guild levels unlock new items, mounts, houses, guild halls, and other privileges for its members. Guilds get a hosted website and forum, as well as a guild bank with officer controls. Guild recruitment tools are integrated into the game. Players can also maintain houses. A secure commission system allows players to sell their crafting skills to other players, or use the common market system to sell finished items.

==History==

SOE markets &quot;EverQuest II&quot; not as a direct sequel, but as a &quot;parallel universe&quot; to the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;. It is set in an alternate future of the original game&#x27;s setting, having diverged at the conclusion of expansion (the lore is explained in an in-game book). This allows both development teams to pursue whatever direction they want to take without impacting the other, and allows players of the original &quot;EverQuest&quot; to continue receiving updates without forcing players down a specific path. In that sense, they are two completely separate games bound together by name only. Players of the original &quot;EverQuest&quot; will find many familiar places and characters, as well as &quot;heritage items&quot; that are similar in name and function to items known from &quot;EverQuest&quot; and can be gained via heritage quests.

In Europe, the game was published by Ubisoft, followed by Koch Media. As of 2010 it lacks any European publisher and is distributed in Europe only as a digital download.

In February 2005, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; ran a promotion with Pizza Hut to allow players to order pizza from within the game. Players could type &quot;/pizza&quot; into the chat bar, which would open the online ordering section of the Pizza Hut website. This promotion has since ended, but generated significant press for the game.

In June 2005, SOE introduced Station Exchange to &quot;EverQuest II&quot;. Station Exchange is an official auction system - only on designated servers - allowing real money to be transferred for in-game money, items or characters.

In March 2006, SOE ended its Chinese/Korean operations for &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, which were supported in the region by Gamania. The beta period for the game in China/Korea ended on 29 March, and on 30 March, all Chinese/Korean accounts were moved to the US servers of the game.

&quot;EQuinox&quot;, an official magazine of &quot;EverQuest II&quot; published by SOE, was released on August 9, 2007.

In December 2008, SOE introduced Station Cash, a real-money trading (RMT) feature.

In January 2009, SOE together with Valve made &quot;EverQuest II&quot; available on Steam.

In July 2010, SOE released a separate version of &quot;EverQuest II&quot; called &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot;, a free to play version of the game funded by micro-transactions or optional subscription play. The free to play version was run on a separate server from the subscription servers.

By November 2011, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; was going free to play following a similar path as &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot;. As of the following month, with the release of GU62 and &quot;Age of Discovery&quot;, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; was updated from being a subscription based game to a free to play title with optional subscription.

Later, in February 2015, SOE&#x27;s parent corporation, Sony Computer Entertainment, sold the studio to investment company Columbus Nova and it was rebranded as Daybreak Game Company, which continues to develop and publish &quot;EverQuest&quot;.

At the end of October 2012, &quot;Krono&quot; was added as an experiment. &quot;Krono&quot; works like the &quot;Plex&quot; currency in &quot;EVE Online&quot;: it allows players to buy an in-game item for real money that adds 30 days of Gold subscription to the account. &quot;Krono&quot; can also be traded between players, sold via the Broker or gifted to another player&#x27;s account. &quot;Krono&quot; is also a much safer way of purchasing game time than purchasing SC cards from players in the game, which may or may not sell a valid code for the players.

===Audio===
A small number of NPCs use actual voices. The actors used for these parts included Hollywood stars such as Heather Graham (as Queen Antonia Bayle), Christopher Lee (as Overlord Lucan D&#x27;Lere) and Minnie Driver (as &#x27;Dancer&#x27;). Wil Wheaton, Dwight Schultz, Richard Horvitz, Alan Dale and Danica McKellar are also part of the cast. According to SOE, in October 2004, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; featured 130 hours of spoken dialog recorded by 266 voice actors. More dialog has been added since release as part of regular game updates. In September 2005, &quot;EverQuest II: Desert of Flames&quot; added player voice emotes. It also features voice actors Peter Renaday, Colleen O&#x27;Shaughnessey, and Nick Jameson.

The music for the game, over ninety minutes&#x27; worth, was composed by Emmy-award-winning composer Laura Karpman and recorded by the FILMharmonic Orchestra Prague under her direction. Karpman said that every place has a theme, its own separate, unique feeling - from a quasi-African savanna to a Babylonian city. Their goal was to bring a cinematic feel in the music. Purchasers of the &quot;EverQuest II&quot; Collector&#x27;s Edition received a soundtrack CD as part of the package. The expansions, &quot;Echoes of Faydwer&quot; and &quot;Rise of Kunark&quot;, included many themes from the corresponding zones in the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;, arranged by Inon Zur. With the &quot;Rise of Kunark&quot; expansion came a major update to the combat music. A new system was added with 14 contextual combat themes. The strength of the enemy or enemies and tide of the battle determine the tone of the combat music. The previous combat music consisted of just a few linear pieces.

===Expansions===

With &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, Sony Online Entertainment introduced the concept of Adventure Packs (an innovation created by Sean Kauppinen, who was the head of international Product PR at the time). Adventure Packs are meant to be smaller &quot;mini-expansions&quot; to the game, adding a plot line with several zones, new creatures and items to the game via digital download. These smaller Adventure Packs come with a smaller fee ranging from US$4.99 to US$7.99, but recently the development team has decided to release free zones and content instead of making adventure packs. Some recent releases include a new starting city, Neriak, with a new starting race, Arasai; and new high level dungeons, The Throne of New Tunaria and the Estate of Unrest.

Similar to other games, expansions can be bought in stores or downloaded through a digital service. The retail versions often come packaged with a bonus feature such as a creature that the player can put in their in-game house. Expansions generally introduce many new zones with new plot lines, features, creatures, items, cities and often come with a boost in the level cap or a new player race. Currently, all players have been given the expansions preceding &quot;Destiny of Velious&quot; as part of the base game. Access to levels above 92 and their respective zones require the purchase of the &quot;Tears of Veeshan&quot; expansion, which includes the previous &quot;Chains of Eternity&quot; expansion. Free to Play accounts have access to the same areas as subscription accounts, but have certain restrictions in place. Many of the free to play restrictions have been removed, including bag slot restrictions, coin restrictions, quest journal limits, race and class restrictions, and gear restrictions, but other restrictions such as the inability to buy or sell items on the broker as a free player, having spell tier restrictions, and being unable to move the alternate advancement slider remain.

* &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; was created for the East Asian market (mainland China, Taiwan, South Korea) but it was terminated as a separate edition on 29 March 2006. &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; players were moved to standard servers. The special character models created for the game had already been included in the standard edition as a client-side option since 2005.
* &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot; - in early 2010, Sony Online Entertainment consulted the &quot;EverQuest II&quot; player population to determine the extent of support for adding a free-to-play model to &quot;EverQuest II&quot;. The resulting product, &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot;, was unveiled in the summer at FanFaire 2010. A significant game update coincided with the beta release of &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot;, which revamped the game&#x27;s user interface and newbie experience and revised many of the previous rules related to character creation. In December 2011, free-to-play access was added to the existing &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot; servers and the former &quot;EverQuest II Extended&quot; Freeport server was added among them.

===Scholarly research===
&quot;EverQuest II&quot; has been used by academics to study a variety of phenomena; for example, that virtual economic behavior in &quot;EverQuest II&quot; follows real-world patterns in terms of production, consumption and money supply; and observations that less than one percent (0.43%) of all the players are Platinum Farmers and more than three quarters (77.66%) of all Platinum Farmers are Chinese.

==Reception==
&quot;EverQuest II&quot; had mostly positive reception from critics, earning an 83 out of 100 average score from aggregate review website Metacritic. Many reviewers compared the title to the original &quot;EverQuest&quot;, which was viewed as one of the best and most influential examples of the genre. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot said that &quot;EverQuest II&quot; isn&#x27;t the massive step for the genre that its predecessor was, but it can still be a fun and addictive online role-playing experience that provides to offer for new and experienced players. Mario Lopez of GameSpy commented that it was &quot;much more inviting, convenient, and forgiving&quot; relative to the first game, but that it was less groundbreaking. The reviewer would find that the breadth of voice acting, however, was its biggest advancement. Lopez would ultimately declare that &quot;EverQuest II&quot; was &quot;extremely fun to play, frequently rewarding, and designed with just the right amount of user convenience in mind&quot;.

The game&#x27;s presentation and photorealistic graphics were often praised, with &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; declaring that &quot;there are off-line games equally or even more spectacular in immediate scenery or character models, but what game can offer such outrageous landscapes on such a grandiose scale?&quot; &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; similarly felt that the game&#x27;s setting was a &quot;brilliantly&quot; reworked world with that technology. According to GameSpot, however, the high system requirements of the title meant that performance issues were common, and that a player would need a &quot;monster system&quot; in order to experience the game in its highest quality. Kasavin additionally commented that the developers of this engine were presumably thinking ahead towards to the future when they built &quot;EverQuest II&quot;″s technology, but that game&#x27;s visuals were not so impressive to justify the extreme system requirements. Steve Butts of IGN likewise found that attempting to play the game on higher graphic settings resulted in &quot;terrible performance&quot;, but that a consistent frame rate with high graphic quality was possible with an appropriate gaming computer. While the editor was &quot;not as huge a fan&quot; of the title&#x27;s visual style, he commended its high level of detail.

&quot;EverQuest II&quot; was nominated for &quot;Best Massively Multiplayer Online Game&quot; in GameSpot&#x27;s Best and Worst of 2004 awards, and was runner-up for &quot;Best Persistent World Game&quot; in IGN&#x27;s Best of 2004 awards, losing both to &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named it the seventh-best computer game of 2004, with its editors declaring it an improvement &quot;upon not only its own predecessor, but just about every predecessor out there&quot;. GameSpy granted &quot;EQII&quot; the title of &quot;Most Improved Game&quot; during its 2006 annual PC awards due to the addition of PvP servers and the release of the &quot;Echoes of Faydwer&quot; expansion that same year. After adopting a free-to-play model in 2011, the title was named &quot;Best Bang for the Buck&quot; in Massively&#x27;s annual awards that same year.

===Sales and subscriptions===
&quot;EverQuest II&quot; reached 100,000 active accounts within 24 hours of release, which grew to over 300,000 two months later in January 2005. As of 2012, the game had an estimated subscriber peak of 325,000 achieved sometime in 2005. As of September 2020, &quot;EverQuest II&quot; had 21,000 subscribers and 29,000 monthly active players.

==East Asian version==

&quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; (Simplified Chinese: &quot;; Traditional Chinese: &quot;; Korean: &quot;&quot;) was an alternate edition of &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, developed for the China, Taiwan and South Korea markets. Sony Online Entertainment developed and shipped &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; to East Asia in April 2005. There were some proprietary missions for &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot;. Sony Online Entertainment developed a separate character model for &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; called &quot;SOGA Model&quot;, which it also imported to the original version on LiveUpdate 16 on November 9, 2005.

&quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; used settings similar to those from the original version. Gamania and SOE added some entities and quests only for the Eastern Version, unlike SOE&#x27;s servers. In &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot;, players could name their character in their local language. In &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot;, most dialogue continued to use English, except the novice tutorial. Gamania localized the novice tutorials as a special feature of &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot;.

Because of the bad reputation of localization, &quot;EverQuest II: East&quot; failed in Asia. Gamania declared its termination on March 29, 2006. All Chinese accounts were transferred to the Mistmoore server, all Taiwanese accounts to the Najena server and all Korean accounts to Unrest.

<text>Shortstop is the second album by the American singer-songwriter Sara Hickman, released in 1990.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album a &quot;sleek commercial effort,&quot; writing that Hickman &quot;rises to the challenge with exquisite vocal control and clever, inventive songs on such diverse topics as Salvador Dali, American hostages, sisterly love and the foibles of male sexuality.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;I Couldn&#x27;t Help Myself&quot; was an adult contemporary hit. &quot;Shortstop&quot; was Hickman&#x27;s sole album for Elektra; she was dropped after its release, in part, because she did not include her &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; soundtrack song, &quot;Blue Eyes Are Sensitive to the Light.&quot;

<text>Whitwick is a village and civil parish in the North West Leicestershire district of Leicestershire, England, close to the town of Coalville in the northwest of the county. It lies in an ancient parish which formerly included the equally historic villages of Thringstone and Swannington. 

It was an important manor in the Middle Ages, which once included Bardon and Markfield, parts of Hugglescote, Donington le Heath, Ratby, Bocheston, Newtown Unthank and Whittington. As early as 1293, Whitwick had a weekly market and a four-day fair. The population of Whitwick, according to the 2001 census was 10,815 persons. 8,092 of these fell into the 16–74 working age range, although only 4,689 were employed. The population of the village at the 2011 census had fallen to 8,612.

==History==
One of the earliest mentions of the place, as &quot;Witewic&quot;, is in the Domesday Book, the name of the settlement possibly meaning either &quot;guardhouse&quot;&quot;The White Farm&quot; or &quot;Hwita&#x27;s Farm&quot; The last two appear to rely on later meanings for both particles Wite and Wik and may have been a reference to the outcrop of white sandstone found here. It was listed amongst the lands given to Hugh de Grandmesnil by King William I. There was said to be land for half a plough and woodland which was a furlong by half a furlong. Its value was two shillings.

===Castle===
Whitwick had a motte and bailey castle, although no remains are left. It was probably built originally during the spate of rapid castle building by William the Conqueror following the spate of rebellions leading up to the harrowing of the north. There appears to be evidence of a timber castle and later stone castle. The timber castle was more likely in place in the 11th century and to have been later held by &#x27;Henricus de Bello Monte, Consanguineus Regis&#x27; (Henry Beaumont, blood-relative of the king). In 1320 he was granted a licence to crenellate the structure. The building work resulting from this licence may have provoked an attack by Sir John Talbot. Beaumont&#x27;s claim to the land was from his wife&#x27;s inheritance and, it seems, Talbot felt he had a claim to Whitwick. Twenty years later the capital message was worth nothing. This stone castle was later held by the Earls of Leicester, though it was recorded as being ruinous by 1427. The foundations are said to have been visible at the end of the 18th century and a wall was still to be seen on the north side in 1893.

It is important to note that the word &#x27;gatehouse&#x27; is likely a corruption of &#x27;guardhouse&#x27;. A gatehouse is usually an entrance to a walled city or a castle entrance. In the case of Whitwic Castle, the castle is in the centre of the town and thus there is no &#x27;gatehouse&#x27;.

The mound retains the title of Castle Hill and is surmounted by a 19th-century folly, with a castellated roofline. This was built in 1846 by a local landowner, Joseph Almond Cropper, as almshouses for the poor.

=== Lead up to the harrying of the north ===
Between the defeat of Harold in 1066 and the creation of the doomsday book in 1086, William the Conqueror faced a number of rebellions which culminated in a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy attack on the north of England destroying homes, food stores and farms. This attack resulted in the deaths of thousands by starvation and the elements. One such rebellion happened at Nottingham. Witewic Castle would appear to have been created in response to the threat from the north. There have been no signs of a pre-Norman occupation and it is known that the rapid creation of motte and bailey castles by William was in response to the rebellions. It is, therefore, possible that the town grew around the castle and not the other way around. The middle-English proves difficult however when considering the 1000ad meaning of Wite as Guard (c1000 Sax. Leechd. III. 154 Þæt bið god swefen, wite þu þæt georne on þinre heortan.) and Wic from roughly the same period meaning &#x27;dwelling&#x27; (c1175 Ormulum (Burchfield transcript) l. 8512 Iosæp..bærenn ure laferrd crist..Fra land to land. fra tun to tun. Fra wic to wic i tune.) It would appear that the castle was a &quot;guard-house&quot; and the town that sprouted up around it took its name.

===Market and fair===
From 1838 until the early 20th century, there was a thriving weekly market held in Whitwick Market Place. As well as the regular local stallholders a number of Leicester tradesmen attended and it is remembered that old ladies used to bring their butter and other farm produce and line up alongside the gutter. In the years following the First World War, competition from the larger and newer market at Coalville eventually resulted in its discontinuance.

The annual fair, or &quot;wakes&quot;, was once a hugely popular event and coincided with the patronal festival of the parish church. At the height of its popularity in the early 20th century, it is remembered that the larger amusements stood in the opening in front of the White Horse public house and there were wild beast shows including seals swimming around in tanks. The local photographer would take snapshots (on glass) and deliver them while the customers waited. There was also once a &#x27;Cabbage Street Wakes&#x27;, of rather obscure origin, when cabbages were used to decorate the lampposts in Cademan Street.

===Curious place names in Whitwick===
A popular affirmation is that the village of Whitwick contains three &#x27;cities&#x27;. The City of Three Waters and the City of Dan are official postal addresses, situated respectively at the foot of Dumps Hill and Leicester Road. Over the years, there have been many contenders for the location of the &#x27;third city&#x27;, the most popular being The City of Hockley – an area located midway between the cities of Three Waters and Dan, close to the parish church, and alongside the watercourse passing through the village. However, older residents have always maintained that this area was known simply as The Hockley, the prefix &#x27;city&#x27;, they suggest, being a retrospective appendage. Even the place-name &#x27;Hockley&#x27; would appear to be a mystery. (The nearby South Derbyshire village of Woodville has an old lane signposted as, simply, &#x27;The City&#x27;).

Equally obscure is the origin of the name &#x27;Dumps Hill&#x27;, a steep incline forming part of a staggered cross-roads at the northern end of the village. Many theories have been expounded to account for its origin, one being that the houses built on the righthand side after the old railway bridge were constructed on the site of the old &#x27;Dumblies&#x27; pig farm. Sheila Smith, in her 1984 history of Whitwick suggests that the name may be linked to framework knitting as in 1845 one Joseph Sheffield, giving evidence before the Commission into the plight of the framework knitters, makes reference to a type of stocking called &#x27;dumps&#x27;. There are several surviving examples of framework knitters&#x27; cottages in the village, which can be recognised by elongated first storey windows, designed to allow greater inlet of light. A good example of such a cottage can be found at the foot of the Dumps.

==Past industry and commerce==

===Framework knitting===
During the 18th century, framework knitting became an important cottage industry in the village, taking over from agriculture. As early as 1723/24, William Clark, son of William, was apprenticed to Joseph Howe. This apprenticeship was to run from Michaelmas 1723/24 for seven years. By the beginning of the 19th century, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire had become the centre of the British hosiery trade, taking over from London. In 1832, it is recorded that there were some 33,000 knitting frames in use in the Midlands, of which the majority – 11,200, were in Leicestershire.

In 1844, there were 423 knitting frames in Whitwick and by this time, the cottage industry had been in decline for some years. This appears to have been as a result of a change in fashions and also to the new type of hose being produced, which required fewer skills in the manufacture. From the middle of the 19th century, framework knitting began to be transferred from homes to the factories in larger towns. By 1851, it is recorded that the number of frames in Whitwick had dwindled to 240.

Large hosiery factories appeared on Church Lane and at the top of The Dumps, shortly before the First World War.

===Mineral water factories===

In addition to the usual village trades, Whitwick also once had three mineral water factories.

The largest of these was the firm of Bernard Beckworth on Cademan Street, which was established in 1875 and ran until the 1970s; it is listed in &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Directories of Leicestershire&quot; from 1904 through to 1941 as &#x27;Beckworth and Co. Ltd, Charnwood Mineral Water Works&#x27;.

By 1904, the firm of Stinson Brothers, based on Loughborough Road, had appeared. By 1912, this firm is listed as simply Horace Stinson and it had disappeared from the Whitwick Directories by 1928.

The firm of Richard Massey appears from 1916, listed at 36, Castle Street, Whitwick. Massey&#x27;s has disappeared by 1941.

A Stinson Bros codd bottle appeared among lots listed for auction in Barnsley (BBR Auctions) on Saturday 8 January 2006. It was described as a 9 inch tall emerald green glass codd bottle, embossed, &#x27;STINSON BROS/WHITWICK.&#x27; The guide price was £80 – £100, the relatively high estimate presumably reflecting the rarity of the glass, but the bottle was in fact sold for £515. The bottle was turned up by a plough in a field opposite A.W.Waldrum&#x27;s Coal Merchant&#x27;s premises on Grace Dieu Road, Whitwick and is the only known example.

There is also known to have existed a &#x27;Botanical Brewery&#x27;, though it is believed that this may have been a part of the Stinson or Massey enterprises, both of which later moved to Hermitage Road. Both firms are listed on Hermitage Road (under Coalville) in a trade directory of 1941. There are also known to have been examples of 19th-century bottles bearing the name of McCarthy and Beckworth, Coalville.

===Coal mining===
Whitwick Colliery is remembered for an underground fire in 1898 that killed 35 miners in Leicestershire&#x27;s worst mining tragedy.

===Railway===
Whitwick railway station was on the Charnwood Forest Railway which was constructed by the Charnwood Forest Company between 1881 and 1883. This branch line ran from Coalville East (joined to the Ashby &amp; Nuneaton Joint Railway (ANJR)) to the town of Loughborough, at the Derby Road Station. Passenger services ceased to operate on 13 April 1931, with freight services ceasing to operate on 12 December 1963. Whitwick railway station still has some surviving structures, the platform and the old station building, now the home of the Whitwick Historical Group, while the railway trackbed towards Coalville has been turned into a footpath.

==Religion==

===St. John the Baptist Parish Church===
The parish church of St. John the Baptist is an ancient structure, nestling in a natural amphitheatre, close to the confluence of two streams. A spring, emanating from under the chancel, is also discharged into the watercourse, through a piped outlet protruding from a stone wall at the east end of the churchyard. This spring is said to have been used during the 19th century as means of powering the bellows of the church organ. It is possible that this site was regarded as sacred in pre-Christian times, thereby influencing the choice of location for the church. It was also conjectured by the local historian, George Green of Loughborough, that a fragment of pre-Norman cross shaft would appear to be incorporated into the chancel wall, supporting the idea that a church may well have existed on this site in Anglo-Saxon times. However, there is no mention of a priest or church connected with Whitwick in the Domesday Survey, and in the absence of conclusive structural evidence beyond the thirteenth century, it is perhaps more likely that the church was built as a later adjunct to the nearby castle. The church we see today is mainly of 14th-century construction, with only the south doorway seeming to go back to the 13th century. The massive decorated western tower contains a peal of eight bells, four of which were cast in 1628, and in the north aisle can be found the mutilated alabaster effigy of a knight, which tradition has to be that of Sir John Talbot, who died in 1365. Talbot is said to have been a giant, and this accounts for the exceptional length of the monument.

The church was a victim of aggressive restoration during the 19th century, when the chancel was rebuilt by James Piers St Aubyn, 1848–1849. A vaulted substructure or crypt is situated beneath the chancel, but is not thought to have ever been used as a charnel house. The building of this understructure would have been necessary to maintain a level between the chancel and the nave due to the steepness of sloping ground at the east end.

In the south exterior wall of the nave, close by the porch, there is a canopied recess, which according to tradition once contained a doorway leading to vaults beneath the south aisle. It is likely that this recess would once have contained a founder&#x27;s tomb. 
From 1319 until its dissolution in 1536, Whitwick Church was an endowment of the Benedictine chapter of Up Holland Priory, near Wigan, Lancashire. Following royal sequestration, the patronage of the living passed to the King and Whitwick Church remains one of forty-two churches nationally which are in the patronage of the Monarch (in the rights of the Duchy of Lancaster).

Today, the church forms part of a united benefice with Thringstone and Swannington. The registers date from 1601.

The churchyard was closed for burials many years ago. In more recent years, many of the 18th- and 19th-century slate headstones were uprooted and moved in a line around the periphery of the southern portion of the graveyard; a 20th-century concrete war memorial now occupies the centre. Other stones were taken up and used for paving around the church.

Whitwick Cemetery, off Church Lane, was consecrated on 24 June 1874 and consists of about four acres. It was divided into three sections: Church of England, Catholic and Nonconformist and placed under the control of a joint burial committee. It contains four Commonwealth war graves of service personnel, one from World War I and three from World War II.

===Vicars of Whitwick 1551—2020===
===Daughter churches and national school===
In the 19th and 20th centuries, new churches were built within the vast, ancient ecclesiastical parish of Whitwick as a result of population growth, all of which later came to serve independent parishes in their own right. Possibly more by coincidence than design, these daughter churches are dedicated respectively to the patron saints of Great Britain: St George&#x27;s, Swannington was built in 1825; St Andrew&#x27;s, Thringstone was built in 1862 and St David&#x27;s, Broom Leys was founded in 1933. Christ Church, Coalville, was also formed partially out of Whitwick Parish in 1836, though the church here stands on land which was originally in the ancient parish of Ibstock, within the chapelry of Hugglescote.

The churches at Swannington, Coalville and Thringstone all owe their existence to the zealous missionary drive of the Reverend Francis Merewether MA (1784–1864), Vicar of Whitwick for more than fifty years, and also Rector of Coleorton. Merewether, a low church theologian who preached and wrote prolifically against Roman Catholicism, was also successful in getting national schools established in these outlying parts of the parish as well as in Whitwick itself. He left behind him a small empire of Anglican expansion, wrought in part by a desire to counteract the &#x27;papist&#x27; revival that he perceived to be sweeping the district, at the instigation of Ambrose de Lisle of Grace Dieu Manor. Whitwick National School, a stone building in the Early English style still stands in the market place, now a Grade Two listed building. An extension to the school was provided in 1903, with access on silver street. The school was replaced later in the 20th century by a new Church of England school located at the foot of Parsonwood Hill. The old school is now used as a day nursery.

St David&#x27;s, Broom Leys was for more than thirty years served by a small wooden church which had originally served as a chapel at the Mowsley Sanitorium near Market Harborough, Leicestershire and was brought over to its present site in sections and duly re-erected. This small structure still stands near the present day &#x27;futuristic&#x27; church, work on which was commenced in 1964. The foundation stone (a piece of Welsh slate from St David&#x27;s in West Wales and presented by the dean of that cathedral) was laid on 26 September 1964 in the presence of about five hundred people. Above the front entrance of the church is the figure of St David, cast in &#x27;ciment fondu&#x27; and coated with a bronze resin. The bricks are a &#x27;Blaby Grey&#x27; and the stonework was provided by the local Whitwick Quarry.

===Other places of worship===

====Methodist and Baptist====
Until the early 19th century, the parish church remained the only place of worship in the village. Then, in the 1820s, the Baptists erected a small chapel on Pares Hill and a society of Wesleyan Methodists opened a chapel on North Street (extended 1879). 
From its foundation in 1823 until 1855, Whitwick Baptist Church remained a branch of the Hugglescote Church. In 1855, both the Whitwick and Coalville Baptist churches separated from Hugglescote and both churches were held under the pastorate of the Revd John Cholerton. A new Baptist church was built at Whitwick in 1861 at a cost of £318.10.0 by William Beckworth, a local builder, alongside the original chapel. By 1890, the minister was the Revd J. J. Berry. It is recorded that for his payment, he accepted the seat rents and weekly collections.

A Primitive Methodist chapel appeared at the foot of Leicester Road (the present day Vicarage Street) in 1864 and a Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built on North Street in 1822 and which was extended in 1879. Wesleyan Reform Methodists also opened a chapel on North Street toward the end of the 19th century, and also in New Swannington in 1906. The Reform Chapel on North Street was used as a warehouse by &#x27;Gracedieu Windows&#x27; until its demolition early in the twenty-first century, when the site was used for building development. The Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists united nationally in 1932 and the two societies in Whitwick finally merged in 1965, after which time the Vicarage Street chapel was used by the amalgamated congregations, the North Street chapel eventually being sold to the Church of England for use as a parish hall in about 1966. In 1972, a new Methodist church was built at the foot of Hall Lane and the Vicarage Street chapel (an example of 19th-century non-conformist architecture in the village) was demolished circa 1980, having fallen into a state of disrepair. The site is now occupied by a car park. Due to extensive housing development during the 1960s, a Methodist church was also built at the other end of Hall Lane in 1966, close to the Broom Leys cross-roads. It is noticeable that in more recent years, structural alterations have been carried out to this building to replace the original flat roof with a pitched one.

====Roman Catholic====
Due to the residency at Grace Dieu Manor of a zealous and wealthy convert to Roman Catholicism, Ambrose de Lisle, Whitwick became an important centre of the Roman Catholic revival.

It was due to De Lisle that a Cistercian monastery, Mount St. Bernard Abbey, was established within the parish in 1835, and a church (designed by Pugin) was built on Parsonwood Hill in 1837. In 1875, a small convent of Rosminian nuns was established in the presbytery, which had been built adjacent to the original church in August 1848, and which transferred to Loughborough in the twentieth century. The presbytery, still referred to as &#x27;The Old Convent&#x27; is now a private residence and was designated a Grade II listed building in 1983.
In establishing his mission, De Lisle recruited a charismatic priest, Aloysius Gentili, from Rome, who arrived at Gracedieu in June 1840 and by May of the following year, De Lisle claimed that some five hundred and twenty persons had become converted to the catholic faith as a result of Gentilli&#x27;s outreach.

The present Roman Catholic Church was built in 1904 from the designs of Thomas Ignatius McCarthy. This was built on the opposite side of Parsonwood Hill, at which time Pugin&#x27;s church was demolished, though the cemetery of the old church remains. A school was also built to the rear of the new church to replace the original school at Turylog (Thurlough), which had been opened in 1843. A tower was added to the new church in about 1910, from funds bequeathed by Samuel Wilson Hallam, landlord of the Queen&#x27;s Head, Thringstone. The tower contains a chime of fifteen bells operated by a baton keyboard, located in the first storey chamber of the tower and which was installed by Taylors of Loughborough in 1960.

====Roman Catholic Priests of Whitwick====
==Local public houses==

In Whitwick there has been, at one time or another, thirty-nine licensed establishments, either an Inn, Public House, Hostelry or Social Club. Most have now closed and even been demolished. Below is an itemised list of the establishments:

==Local government==
In the 2007 North West Leicestershire District Council elections, the British National Party won both Hugglescote and Whitwick – the first seats to be won by the BNP in Leicestershire and Whitwick gained its first Conservative councillor. As of October 2024 the Councillors for Whitwick are currently Peter Moult (Labour); Tony Gillard (Conservative) and Anthony Barker(Labour).

Whitwick County Councillor, as of October 2024 is Tony Gillard (Conservative).

Following a campaign by local people, the District Council carried out a community governance review and made an Order on 12 May 2010 to set up the new Parish Council. Whitwick Parish Council held its Inaugural Meeting on 18 May 2011.

==Mount St Bernard and Gracedieu==

Mount St. Bernard Abbey, a Cistercian monastery was established in 1835 in the parish of Whitwick on the Charnwood Forest.
The current monastery was designed by the famous architect Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, best known for his work on the Houses of Parliament.

In 1840, a hoard of two thousand Roman coins was discovered during ploughing operations at the monastery.

Gracedieu Vineyard is south facing and was established in 1995 in Charnwood Forest. Its &#x27;Green Man&#x27; wine is based on the Madeleine Angevine grape.

<text>The German mark ( ; sign: ℳ︁) was the currency of the German Empire, which spanned from 1871 to 1918. The mark was paired with the minor unit of the pfennig (₰); 100 pfennigs were equivalent to 1 mark. The mark was on the gold standard from 1871 to 1914, but like most nations during World War I, the German Empire removed the gold backing in August 1914, and gold coins ceased to circulate.

After the fall of the Empire due to the November Revolution of 1918, the mark was succeeded by the Weimar Republic&#x27;s mark, derisively referred to as the Papiermark () due to hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic from 1918 to 1923.

==History==
The introduction of the German mark in 1873 was the culmination of decades-long efforts to unify the various currencies used by the German Confederation. The Zollverein unified in 1838 the Prussian and South German currencies at a fixed rate of 1 Prussian thaler = South German gulden = 16.704 g fine silver. A larger currency convention in 1857 replaced the Prussian thaler with the Vereinsthaler of g fine silver, equivalent to 1 North German thaler, Austro-Hungarian florins, or South German gulden.

Unification to this system proceeded further due to German Unification in 1871 as well as monetary conventions from 1865 to 1870 expressing a desire to move to the gold standard. For this system a new unit &quot;mark&quot; was proposed equal to a &quot;drittelthaler&quot; or Vereinsthaler, also equal to the Austrian gulden, but decimally divided into 100 pfennig instead of the existing 120 pfennig. The new mark of 5 g fine silver was equivalent to g fine gold. With 5 billion gold francs (equivalent to 4.05 billion gold marks) secured from France at the end of the Franco-Prussian War, the new currency was launched in 1873 in the form of gold 10-mark and 20-mark coins as well as limited legal-tender silver marks and copper pfennigs. The German Empire&#x27;s conversion to the gold standard led to the same being adopted in the rest of Europe and North America, as well as the change in standard in the Latin Monetary Union from bimetallism to solely gold.

Despite the Vereinsthaler being a silver standard currency, it remained unlimited legal tender for 3 gold marks until it was demonetized in 1908. The South German gulden of Vereinsthaler was converted to or 1.71 gold marks. The gold-based Bremen thaler was converted directly to the mark at a rate of 1 Thaler gold = or 3.32 marks. The Hamburg mark courant or currency was converted at 1 mark = 1.2 Imperial marks, and the Hamburg mark banco of the Bank of Hamburg was converted at 1 mark banco = 1.5 Imperial marks.

From 1 January 1876 onwards, the mark and became the only legal tenders. Before 1914, the mark was on a gold standard with 2790 marks equal to 1 kilogram of pure gold (1 mark =  mg). The term was created later to retrospectively distinguish it from the (paper mark) which suffered a serious loss of value through hyperinflation following World War I during hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic. For comparison, from 1900 to 1933, the United States adhered to a gold standard as well with the gold dollar containing fine gold; it was therefore worth 4.198 gold marks. The monetary hegemon of the time when the gold mark was in use, however, was the pound sterling, with the sovereign (£1) being valued at 20.43 gold marks.

World War I reparations owed by Germany were stated in gold reserves in 1921, 1929 and 1931; this was the victorious Allies&#x27; response to their fear that vanquished Germany might try to pay off the obligation in paper currency. The actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks cited in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 billion marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion German gold marks, worth about or . Most of that money came from loans from New York bankers.

Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, payments of reparations were officially abandoned. West Germany after World War II did not resume payment of reparations as such, but did resume the payment of debt that Germany had acquired in the inter-war period to finance its reparation payments, paying off the principal on those debts by 1980. The interest on those debts was paid off on 3 October 2010, the 20th anniversary of German reunification.

==Coins==
Coins of denominations between 1 pfennig and 1 mark were issued in standard designs for the whole empire, whilst those above 1 mark were issued by the individual states, using a standard design for the reverses (the , the eagle insignia of the German Empire) with a design specific to the state on the obverse, generally a portrait of the monarch of the kingdom or duchy (and not that of the emperor); while the free cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and Lübeck each used the city&#x27;s coat of arms. Occasionally commemorative coins were minted, in which cases the obverse and (much more rarely) the reverse designs might depart from the usual pictorial standards. Many of the smaller states issued coins in very small numbers. Also, in general all states&#x27; coinage became very limited after the First World War began. Well-preserved examples of such low-mintage coins can be rare and valuable. The Principality of Lippe was the only state not to issue any gold coins in this period.

===Base metal coins===
* 1 pfennig (copper: 1873–1916, aluminium: 1916–1918)
* 2 pfennig (copper: 1873–1916)
* 5 pfennig (cupro-nickel: 1873–1915, iron: 1915–1922)
* 10 pfennig (cupro-nickel: 1873–1916, iron and zinc: 1915–1922)
* 20 pfennig (cupro-nickel, 1887–1892)
* 25 pfennig (nickel, 1909–1912)

===Silver coins===

Subsidiary silver coins were minted in .900 fineness to a standard of 5 grams silver per mark. Production of 2 and 5 mark coins ceased in 1915 while 1-mark coins continued to be issued until 1916. A few 3 mark coins were minted until 1918, and mark coins continued to be issued in silver until 1919.

* 20 pfennig, 1.1111 g (1 g silver), only until 1878
* mark or 50 pfennig, 2.7778 g (2.5 g silver)
* 1 mark, 5.5555 g (5 g silver)
* 2 mark, 11.1111 g (10 g silver)
* 3 mark, 16.6667 g (15 g silver), from 1908 onwards
* 5 mark, 27.7778 g (25 g silver)

These silver coins are token or subsidiary currency for the gold mark and are therefore legal tender only up to 20 marks. However, all silver 3-mark s issued before 1871 enjoyed unlimited legal tender status even after the switch-over to the gold standard. This ended with the demonetization of the in 1908 and the introduction of the new subsidiary 3-mark coins.

The 5-mark coin, however, was significantly closer in value to older thalers (and other such crown-sized coins).

===Gold coins===
Gold coins were minted in .900 fineness to a standard of 2,790 mark = 1 kilogram of gold (a mark was therefore about of gold; a troy ounce of gold was worth 86.78 ℳ︁). Gold coin production ceased in 1915. 5-mark gold coins were minted only in 1877 and 1878.

* 5 mark, 1.9912 g (1.7921 g gold)
* 10 mark, 3.9825 g (3.5842 g gold)
* 20 mark, 7.965 g (7.1685 g gold) 

The 20 mark is the most seen and offers a variety of different types that were mass-produced and therefore can be purchased at a low premium above each coin&#x27;s melt value. However, some designs are extremely elusive given that they were struck in very low mintages. The rarest type features Adolph Friedrich V with just 1,160 pieces issued by the Berlin Mint. 

==Banknotes==

Banknotes were issued by the Imperial Treasury (known as &quot;Reichskassenschein&quot;) and the Reichsbank, as well as by the banks of some of the states. Imperial Treasury notes were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20 and 50 Mark, whilst Reichsbank notes were produced in denominations of 20, 50, 100 and 1000 Mark. The notes issued after 1914 are referred to as Papiermark.

<text>David Anthony Brock (born 20 August 1941) is an English musician and multi-instrumentalist, best known as the founder, the sole constant member and the musical focus of the space rock group Hawkwind. Brock was honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the annual Progressive Music Awards in 2013.

==Early years==
Brock was born in Isleworth, Middlesex. His childhood was spent in Feltham, Middlesex; he attended the Longford Secondary Modern School (now called Rivers Academy). His father&#x27;s brother introduced him to music, giving him a banjo at the age of twelve, and a school art teacher encouraged him in his learning. Brock&#x27;s influences at this time included Fats Domino and Humphrey Lyttelton.

After leaving school in 1959, he undertook several jobs including work as a capstan setter, before moving to an animation company, Larkin Studios. He pursued his interests in music at night, although with no initial intentions of it becoming a career, attending clubs such as Eel Pie Island, playing New Orleans trad jazz and blues, and busking with friends such as Eric Clapton, Keith Relf, Jeff Watson and Mick Slattery (born 
Michael Daniel Slattery, 15 February 1946, Richmond-upon-Thames died 17 March 2023).

He formed a trio with pianist Mike King and harmonica player Luke Francis (born 1943, Newcastle-upon-Tyne) called the Dharma Blues Band; this group recorded versions of Sonny Boy Williamson II&#x27;s &quot;Dealing with the Devil&quot; and Pete Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot; for &quot;Blues Anytime Vol. 2&quot; (Immediate, IMCP015) in 1966, and backed travelling American blues singers such as Memphis Slim and Champion Jack Dupree. The band would continue without Brock, recording an album in 1967.

Quitting his daytime job, he travelled around Europe earning money by busking, sometimes with harmonica player Pete Judd. With guitarist John Illingworth (born John Michael Illingsworth, 11 October 1942, Sheffield), Brock and Judd formed The Famous Cure, touring in the Netherlands, and again after Slattery had replaced Judd in 1967, also having a hit single with &quot;Sweet Mary&quot;/&quot;Mean Mistreater&quot;. With the psychedelic scene burgeoning in London and the band using LSD, their music changed with them starting to use electric instruments and effects units.

In 1968 he resorted to busking for a living and, on the back of the success of Don Partridge&#x27;s hits &quot;Rosie&quot; and &quot;Blue Eyes&quot;, performed in January 1969 at the Buskers&#x27; Concert at the Royal Albert Hall, contributing &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; to &quot;The Buskers&quot; album (Columbia, SX6356). In April and May, Brock joined the Buskers tour of the UK, which travelled around the country to each venue in a red London Transport double-decker bus.

== Hawkwind ==
In 1969, Slattery and Brock continued jamming together and with whoever else was around. The genesis of Hawkwind was in their meeting with bass player John A Harrison (born 28 May 1942, died 26 May 2012), who was also taking an interest in experimental music after stints in more conventional bands such as the Joe Loss Band. A music paper advert brought in teenage drummer Terry Ollis, while friends Nik Turner and Dik Mik were invited to join the band on saxophone and electronics respectively after the pair had originally offered their services as roadcrew.

From the outset, Brock&#x27;s intentions for the band was to marry simple three-chord rock music with experimental electronic music. He cites his influences for the band at the time as the Moody Blues, Steve Miller Band and the krautrock scene of Kraftwerk, Neu! and particularly Can.

Doctor Technical was an &quot;alter ego&quot; created by Brock for his production credit on &quot;Silver Machine&quot;. He has regularly used the alias since at various times, notably for the album &quot;Church of Hawkwind&quot;. He has also used the aliases Dr Hasbeen and Sylvia Macmanus (his second wife&#x27;s name).

Brock has remained Hawkwind&#x27;s musical focus and primary songwriter throughout their existence. He has little interest in lyrics and much of the time has benefited from collaborating with lyricists such as Robert Calvert and Michael Moorcock. Although being the only ever-present member of the band, there have been times, particularly in the early days when the line-up was fluid, when he would miss gigs such as the 1971 Glastonbury Festival. On stage, his preference is to remain at the back and let others take centre stage and be the focus of attention, to the point where he will often employ dancers, mime artists and fire-eaters to fill that space. At other times (particularly in their early days), the entire band was totally obscured by their light show.

The band are based in Devon, where they rehearse and record in a converted barn named Earth Studios.

== Equipment ==
Brock has used a variety of guitars over the years. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brock primarily used Westone guitars: from 1985 a Westone Spectrum LX (custom-painted by Alan Arthurs, with a portion of the &quot;Space Ritual&quot; album cover), and a Westone Paduak–1 from 1982 until 2008 (custom-painted by Guy Thomas, with the &quot;Warrior on the Edge of Time&quot; album cover). Brock now uses a 2007 Gibson Antique Artist or a 1997 Gibson Nighthawk Standard. Noticeably, Brock has also used the same amplifier for many years: a 1978 Roland JC120 with two Hiwatt 4x12 cabs painted by Barney Bubbles. For effects, Brock uses a Line 6 Pod V2, which produces the distinctive sounds associated with him.

<text>Denis Gallagher (29 December 1922 – 3 November 2001) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He served as Minister for the Gaeltacht on two occasions.

==Early life==
Denis Gallagher was born in Currane, by Clew Bay, facing Achill Island, County Mayo in 1922, the son of John Gallagher, a merchant, and his wife Catherine (née Gallagher). He grew up speaking English and Irish. He was educated locally and at Coláiste Éinde in Salthill. He qualified as a national school teacher having graduated from St Patrick&#x27;s College in Drumcondra, Dublin. He taught in Drimnagh in Dublin for several years before returning to Mayo in 1946 to take up a teaching post. He married Hannah McHugh of Keel West, Achill in 1948, and they had twelve children.

==Politics==
Gallagher stood as a Clann na Poblachta candidate at the 1954 general election for Mayo North but was not elected. In the 1960s Gallagher changed allegiance and became a member of Fianna Fáil. He was elected to Mayo County Council in 1967 and was elected to Dáil Éireann on his third attempt at the 1973 general election for the Mayo West constituency. In 1974, he was appointed Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Fisheries. Fianna Fáil won the 1977 general election and Jack Lynch became Taoiseach. He appointed Gallagher as Minister for the Gaeltacht. He was an active minister with an interest in Irish language affairs. In the 1979 leadership contest Gallagher supported George Colley. However, Charles Haughey won the election, becoming Taoiseach, and Gallagher lost his position in cabinet. In March 1980, he was appointed as Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Commerce and Tourism He served in this role until the Fianna Fáil lost office in June 1981. His main achievement as minister was the establishment in 1979 of a new gaeltacht authority, Údarás na Gaeltachta.

Fianna Fáil returned to government in March 1982. In October 1982, following the resignations of Martin O&#x27;Donoghue and Desmond O&#x27;Malley from the cabinet, Gallagher returned as Minister for the Gaeltacht. He remained in that post until December when Fianna Fáil went into opposition.

Following the 1987 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to government. Haughey appointed himself as Minister for the Gaeltacht as well as Taoiseach, with Gallagher as Minister of State at the Department of the Gaeltacht. Gallagher retired from politics at the 1989 general election. After his retirement, he worked to advance the Irish language cause and also served as chairman of the Gaelic Athletic Association in Mayo.

He died in Castlebar on 3 November 2001, aged 78.

<doc id="1080473" wikidata="Q1975691" url="?curid=1080473" title="Coombe Bissett">
<text>Coombe Bissett is a village and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire in the River Ebble valley, southwest of Salisbury on the A354 road that goes south towards Blandford Forum. The parish includes the village of Homington, to the east towards the village of Odstock.

==History==
Records from Saxon times indicate that the Ebble valley was a thriving area, the River Ebble also being known as the River Chalke. The Domesday Book in 1086 divided the Chalke Valley into eight manors: &quot;Chelke&quot; (Chalke – Bowerchalke and Broadchalke), &quot;Eblesborne&quot; (Ebbesbourne Wake), &quot;Fifehide&quot; (Fifield Bavant), &quot;Cumbe&quot; (Coombe Bissett), &quot;Humitone&quot; (Homington), &quot;Odestoche&quot; (Odstock), &quot;Stradford&quot; (Stratford Tony and Bishopstone) and &quot;Trow&quot; (circa Alvediston). The Domesday Book also recorded &quot;Cumbe&quot; as a royal manor with 85 households, while &quot;Humitone&quot; had just two households. A medieval packhorse bridge, now a footbridge, crosses the Ebble close to the current road bridge at Coombe Bissett.

Coombe Bissett and Homington were separate parishes, each with its own church, until they were united in a joint benefice in 1885. Homington was absorbed into Coombe Bissett civil parish in 1934.

== Religious sites ==

The two Anglican churches below are served by the Chalke Valley team ministry.

=== St Michael&#x27;s, Coombe Bissett ===

The oldest part of St Michael&#x27;s, the south aisle, is from the 12th century. The chancel was built in the 13th and the tower (with stair-turret) added in the 14th; the nave and north transept are 15th-century. Restoration in 1845 by T.H. Wyatt included the rebuilding of the west front, reducing the length of the building. The church is a Grade I listed building.
=== St Mary&#x27;s, Homington ===

St Mary&#x27;s is a 14th-century church, possibly with earlier origins. The tower of the present church is from the early 17th century and there was extensive restoration in the 1860s. The church is a Grade II* listed building. 

=== Nonconformist chapels ===
A Primitive Methodist chapel was built in 1841 at the west end of Homington village, then rebuilt in 1877. The chapel closed in 1967 and is now a private house. In 1895 a Baptist chapel was opened at Coombe Bissett, on the road to Homington, and is used by the Coombe Fellowship.

==Amenities==
Coombe Bissett has a pub, the &quot;Fox and Goose&quot;, a village hall, and a shop with a post office. A primary school was built at Shutts Lane in the 1960s, replacing a small National School on the Homington road which was built in 1845. Homington and Coombe Bissett Downs is a nature reserve on nearby chalk downland. There are various clubs within the village, including a tennis club, cricket club and badminton club. Salisbury and South Wiltshire Golf Course is to the north of the village. Salisbury Hospital is to the east, north of Odstock village and a 10-minute drive from Coombe Bissett.

==Notable people==
*Tancred Borenius (1885–1948), Finnish art historian, died at Laverstock House hospital and is buried in Coombe Bissett churchyard.
*Tim Smith (1961–2020), songwriter, composer and former leader of Cardiacs, spent his later years near Coombe Bissett.

<text>Gevelsberg (; Westphalian: &quot;Gievelsbiärg&quot;) is a town in the district of Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==

The town lies in the valley of the river Ennepe in the Süder Uplands, which is part of the Rhenish Massif.

==History==

The town has a history of nearly 785 years. The archbishop of Cologne Engelbert II of Berg was killed on November 7, 1225 by his cousin Frederick of Isenberg in &quot;Gievilberch&quot;. As a consequence, a monastery of atonement (German: &quot;Sühnekloster)&quot; was established at the place of Engelbert&#x27;s death and became the origin of the settlement resulting in today&#x27;s Gevelsberg.

The population grew strongly in the 19th century, when many small industries related to iron processing were developed.

===Coat of arms===
Gevelsberg received its coat of arms (a brick gable on a green hill, and a cogwheel indicating its industry) by decree of the Prussian Department of the Interior in 1903. In the mid-1950s a city wall was added to the coat of arms.

==Politics==
The current mayor of Gevelsberg is Claus Jacobi of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2004. In the most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, Jacobi was re-elected with 87.1% of votes, defeating Felix Keßler, who was endorsed by the CDU, Free Voters, The Greens, and FDP.

<text>The Stanford bunny is a computer graphics 3D test model developed by Greg Turk and Marc Levoy in 1994 at Stanford University. The model consists of 69,451 triangles, with the data determined by 3D scanning a ceramic figurine of a rabbit. This figurine and others were scanned to test methods of &quot;range scanning&quot; physical objects.

The data can be used to test various graphics algorithms, including polygonal simplification, compression, and surface smoothing. There are a few complications with this dataset that can occur in any 3D scan data: the model is manifold connected and has holes in the data, some due to scanning limits and some due to the object being hollow. These complications provide a more realistic input for any algorithm that is benchmarked with the Stanford bunny, though by today&#x27;s standards, in terms of geometric complexity and triangle count, it is considered a simple model.

The model was originally available in .ply (polygons) file format in four different resolutions.

The model can be found at https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/

<text>Mary&#x27;s Igloo (&quot;Qawiaraq&quot; or &quot;Aġviġnaq&quot; in Iñupiaq) is an abandoned village located in the Nome Census Area of the Unorganized Borough in the U.S. state of Alaska, now used as a fish camp. Many former residents and their descendants currently live in nearby Teller or the next largest community, Nome.

==History==
The Inupiat village of &quot;Kauwerak&quot; was located about downriver from Mary&#x27;s Igloo. By 1900, Kauwerak was abandoned and most of its residents moved to Teller or Nome because of schools and employment opportunities. A few settled at the site of Mary&#x27;s Igloo, which they called &quot;Aukvaunlook&quot; (&quot;Aġviġnaq&quot;), meaning &quot;black whale.&quot;

During the gold prospecting period of the early 1900s, non-Natives named the village &quot;Mary&#x27;s Igloo,&quot; after an Inupiaq woman named Mary, who welcomed miners, trappers and others into her home for coffee. During that period, Mary&#x27;s Igloo was a transfer point for supplies for the gold fields upriver on the Kuzitrin and Kougarok rivers. The supplies were offloaded from ocean boats onto barges, which were towed to their destinations. A post office and store were opened at Mary&#x27;s Igloo in 1901. By the 1910 census, Mary&#x27;s Igloo was a community of 141 Inupiat and Anglo-Americans, who were miners, innkeepers, missionaries and support crews for the barges. It had schools, a post office and other services.

The flu epidemic of 1918 and 1919 and a tuberculosis epidemic, two years later, decimated the community&#x27;s population. Catholic and Lutheran orphanages opened in the area to care for children left without parents.

The schools closed in 1948 and 1950 for lack of students and the post office and store also closed in 1952. Most of the residents moved to Nome or Teller.

The site of Mary&#x27;s Igloo presently has no permanent population. It is used as a seasonal fish camp by some residents of Teller.

== Demographics ==

Mary&#x27;s Igloo first appeared on the 1910 U.S. Census as &quot;Igloo&quot;, an unincorporated village. It did not officially appear as Mary&#x27;s Igloo until 1950. It did not appear again on the census until 1980, although the population was zero. It was classified as an Alaskan Native Village Statistical Area (ANVSA). It has not reported any residents since.

==Geography==
Mary&#x27;s Igloo is located at ., on the northwest bank of the Kuzitrin River, on the Seward Peninsula. It is northeast of Nome and 65 km (40 mi) southeast of Teller.

<doc id="1080508" wikidata="Q416641" url="?curid=1080508" title="Cerium(IV) sulfate">
<text>Cerium(IV) sulfate, also called ceric sulfate, is an inorganic compound. It exists as the anhydrous salt Ce(SO4)2 as well as a few hydrated forms: Ce(SO4)2(H2O)x, with x equal to 4, 8, or 12. These salts are yellow to yellow/orange solids that are moderately soluble in water and dilute acids. Its neutral solutions slowly decompose, depositing the light yellow oxide CeO2. Solutions of ceric sulfate have a strong yellow color. The tetrahydrate loses water when heated to 180-200 °C.

It is insoluble in glacial acetic acid and pure (96%) ethanol.

It was historically produced by direct reaction of fine, calcined cerium (IV) oxide and concentrated sulfuric acid, yielding the tetrahydrate.

==Uses==
The ceric ion is a strong oxidizer, especially under acidic conditions. If ceric sulfate is added to dilute hydrochloric acid, then elemental chlorine is formed, albeit slowly. With stronger reducing agents it reacts much faster. For example, with sulfite in acidic environments it reacts quickly and completely.

When ceric compounds are reduced, so-called &quot;cerous&quot; compounds are formed. The reaction taking place is:
:Ce4+ + e− → Ce3+
The cerous ion is colorless.

Ceric sulfate is used in analytical chemistry for redox titration, often together with a redox indicator.

A related compound is ceric ammonium sulfate.

The solubility of Ce(IV) in methanesulfonic acid is approximately 10 times the value obtainable in acidic sulfate solutions.

<text>Greg Turk is an American-born researcher in the field of computer graphics and a professor at the School of Interactive Computing in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). His paper &quot;Zippered polygon meshes from range images&quot;, concerning the reconstruction of surfaces from point data, brought the &quot;Stanford bunny&quot;, a frequently used example object in computer graphics research, into the CGI lexicon. Turk actually purchased the original Stanford Bunny and performed the initial scans on it. He is also known for his work on simplification of surfaces, and on reaction–diffusion-based texture synthesis. In 2008, Turk was the technical papers chair of SIGGRAPH 2008. In 2012, Greg Turk was awarded the ACM Computer Graphics Achievement Award 2012.

==Education and computer graphics research==
After receiving his Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill under the supervision of Henry Fuchs in 1992, Turk was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University from 1992 to 1994 with Marc Levoy before he returned to UNC-Chapel Hill as a research professor from 1994 to 1996. He joined the Georgia Tech faculty in 1996. The following year, Turk was awarded an NSF CAREER Award, one of the most prestigious awards granted by the NSF to new faculty.

It was while at Stanford that he first brought the &quot;Stanford bunny&quot; back to the lab for scanning, which he recounts in a &quot;had I but known&quot; fashion:

==Personal life==
Turk was born in 1961, and grew up in Southern California. He attended Santa Monica High School in the 1970s, where he was a member of the nonmusical group &quot;The Olive Starlight Orchestra&quot;, along with David Linden, Keith Goldfarb, David Coons, Susan P. Crawford, Eric Enderton and Jan Steckel. He did his undergraduate work at UCLA.

A guitarist in a short-lived band while he attended UCLA, Turk performed with the group as &quot;Industrial Waist&quot;, which also had Jack Watt (on drums; formerly Jackie Watt before he transitioned), the mathematician and teacher Paul Lockhart (lead vocals, guitar; Lockhart later became known for writing the internet sensation, and later book, &quot;A Mathematician&#x27;s Lament&quot;), the Rhythm and Hues Studios co-founder Keith Goldfarb (bass guitar player), and Alex Melnick (the band&#x27;s original drummer). Turk and Lockhart were roommates in Santa Monica for a couple of years while they attended UCLA.

Turk lives in Atlanta.

<doc id="1080518" wikidata="Q7952954" url="?curid=1080518" title="WMNF">
<text>WMNF (88.5 MHz) is an FM non-commercial community radio station in Tampa, Florida. It is owned by the Nathan B. Stubblefield Foundation and it airs a mix of music shows and news programming. It is supported by listener contributions and has studios on East Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Tampa.

WMNF is a Class C1 FM station with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 6,650 watts. The transmitter is off Colonnade Vista Drive in Riverview, Florida.

==Programs and personnel==
Since its inception, WMNF has had a paid staff, but most of the programming is by volunteers. WMNF has aired a wide variety of music shows, including programs featuring Adult Album Alternative (AAA), Blues, Bluegrass, Folk, Alternative Rock, Rockabilly, R&amp;B, Soul music, Urban Gospel, Celtic music, Jazz, Salsa and Experimental music.

The early WMNF schedule featured Folk and Acoustic music in the morning; Big Band and Nostalgia midday; Jazz Blues and Reggae in the afternoon; and Bluegrass in afternoon drivetime. Gospel, Soul, Jewish, Sixties, Celtic and New Wave filled evenings and the weekend.

In the nineties the station phased out Big Band and Nostalgia and midday became filled with public affairs and talk shows, anchored by the national show Democracy Now and a daily talk show called Radioactivity hosted by News Director Rob Loeei until 2021. WMNF airs several progressive talk and news programs focused on LGBTQ issues, animal and environmental preservation and civil right, hosted mostly by volunteers.

Among the long-running music shows are: &quot;The Sixties Show, Gospel Classic Hour, The Soul Party&quot; and &quot;The Freak Show&quot;. Past public affairs programs included &quot;RadioActivity&quot; and &quot;The Women&#x27;s Show&quot;, touching on feminist issues that first started running in the 1980s. Current long running PA shows include &quot;Art in Your Ear&quot;, &quot;Talking Animals&quot;, and &quot;True Talk,&quot; which focuses on the Middle East and the global issues Muslims face.

In 1986, WMNF began the first hip hop show in the area, The Kenny K Wax Attack, which aired on Saturdays at midnight. An Arbitron rating showed 42% of radio listeners under 25 were listening to Kenny K. Saturday late night remains hip hop programming as of May 2024.

In 2014, WMNF added to the schedule, &quot;The Rhythm Revival,&quot; hosted by nationally known recording artist/music historian Reverend Billy C. Wirtz. In 2021, Marvelous Marvin, a longtime popular DJ on Tampa Bay commercial radio, joined the show as a cohost. The Friday drive-time high-energy presentation of post WW2 blues, country and gospel is a station highlight.

In 2022, WUSF discontinued evening and overnight jazz programming to the dismay of area jazz fans. WMNF recruited WUSF’s longtime former jazz director Bob Seymour to present a Monday evening jazz show on WMNF. Jazz fans have embraced the new show &quot;Jazz in the Night.&quot;

==History==
Before going on the air the station conducted a door to door campaign to raise startup funds. The station signed on the air on . It was established by the Nathan B. Stubblefield Foundation, a non-profit organization started solely for this purpose. The Board of Directors comprises programmers, volunteers, staff, and community members. The first WMNF studios were in an old house in south Tampa, moving to a vacated church on Nebraska Avenue in Tampa in 1981.

WMNF was originally powered at 70,000 watts but on a much shorter tower. When its tower tripled in height in 2007, its power was reduced but still with better coverage.

WMNF holds periodic on-air fundraisers and seeks donations and volunteers on its website. Its supporters account for approximately 70% of its funding. There are three pledge drives each year. The station has paid operations staff, but most of the hosts and pledge drive workers are volunteers.

==Facilities==
In 2005, WMNF moved into new state of the art studios and production space financed by listener donations. The facility is located adjacent to the old studio which was demolished and now serves as a parking lot. The new facility is over with three broadcast studios, two production studios and a live performance studio named in memory of Mike Eisenstadt, longtime host of the &quot;Sunday Simcha&quot;, a Jewish music and public affairs show that still airs on Sundays at 2pm. The music library can store approximately 100,000 CDs, and has about 8,000 record albums.

In 2007, WMNF moved to a higher antenna tower at 469 meters (1539 feet) in height above average terrain (HAAT). The signal stretches from Clearwater and Bradenton to Lakeland and Fort Meade.

==Controversies==
In 1997, Florida State Senator John Grant zeroed out $104,000 in state funding from the annual budget, citing his displeasure at the lyrics of a song he had heard broadcast (Iris DeMent&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland of the Free&quot;). In response to the shortfall, the station staged an emergency fundraiser that took in $122,000 in a day and a half. Then Program Director Randy Wynne indicated his belief that such difficulties arose after WMNF aired several criticisms against State Senator Grant&#x27;s opposition to Olympic gold medalist diver and outspoken LGBTQ activist Greg Louganis attending a speaking engagement at the University of South Florida.

On February 18, 2019, WMNF posted that they ended their &quot;long-running relationship with News Director Rob Lorei&quot; and for more information to &quot;contact General Manager Craig Kopp.&quot; Rob Lorei filed a grievance with the station’s board of directors. There was a &quot;public outcry&quot; with &quot;some supporters canceled donations&quot; and within the first few days comments from listeners and supporters &quot;poured in at station meetings, and online via WMNF’s social media bulletin board&quot;

Josh Holton, former WMNF board member and previous supporter of Craig Kopp wrote that he would no longer support him due to “the completely inappropriate manner in which he has handled this monumentally catastrophic decision, which has hurt our budget, our brand and our reputation.”

On March 18, 2019, the Board of Directors of WMNF posted a statement which said that they would &quot;reinstate Rob to his role as News &amp; Public Affairs Director at WMNF.&quot; David Harbeitner (President of the Board of Directors of WMNF) shared that:

 The Board has reached the decision to reinstate Rob to his role as News and Public Affairs director at WMNF. We believe that both Rob and Craig Kopp, the station general manager, can and should play a critical role in the present and future of WMNF. This event, unfortunately, has reinforced the value of WMNF and the impact we have in the local community, particularly in regards to News and Public Affairs. It also has heightened our commitment to support the Tampa Bay community and to give a voice to the under-served.”

On April 15, 2019 WMNF&#x27;s General Manager Craig Kopp resigned and noted the community’s reaction to the firing and re-hiring of Rob Lorei as a reason, alone with &quot;anti-Semitic and other ‘toxic’ comments made&quot;

Craig Kopp wrote: “I love WMNF as a concept and have dedicated myself to setting it up to continue far into the future ... But the reinstatement of Rob Lorei assures that it will remain firmly rooted in the past.”

In 2021, 43-year station veteran Rob Lorei was terminated by WMNF. Lorei, the public affairs director and show host said he was not given a reason. He told the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; &quot;No community radio station has been as consistently successful as WMNF. You&#x27;ll have to ask the general manager why he terminated me.&quot;
The station told the newspaper that Lorei was given the reason by the general manager and a member of the board and that it would be his choice to disclose the reason. Lorei had been the host of &quot;Radioactivity with Rob Lorei&quot;, which aired weekdays at 11 a.m.

Over three months later WMNF stated in a letter that Rob Lorei used an &quot;ethnic slur towards a listener from a station email account.&quot; Rob Lorei denied using &#x27;an ethnic slur&#x27; and said he used a &#x27;political term&#x27; in a reply to a listener who wrote it to &quot;downplay the dangers of the Proud Boys.&quot; Will 
Greaves, WMNF Board President, disagrees and said the term was not a political term but rather “It was an anti-Semitic racial slur that is highly offensive to any Jewish person.”

Creative Loafing Tampa Bay reported that opinions on use of the term and its &#x27;hurtfulness&#x27; were mixed from the Jewish community. Creative Loafing Tampa Bay wrote that while &quot;most folks agree that it was not the best choice of words ... many in the community do believe that Lorei never meant to use the word in an anti-semitic manner.&quot;

Creative Loafing Tampa Bay says they are giving some context by referencing that Rob Lorei, in 1978, snuck into a Ku Klux Klan rally to 
assess how deep-seated the racism was&quot; and how much of &quot;a threat the KKK was to the Tampa Bay area.&quot; and in 1980 Rob Lorei helped &quot;usher in WMNF’s first Jewish program (“The Jewish Sound,” now known as “The Sunday Simcha”)&quot;

<doc id="1080519" wikidata="Q477405" url="?curid=1080519" title="Butera">
<text>Butera (Sicilian: &quot;Vutera&quot;) is an Italian town and a commune in the province of Caltanissetta, in the southern part of the island of Sicily. It is bounded by the &quot;comuni&quot; of Gela, Licata, Mazzarino, Ravanusa and Riesi. It has a population of 4,653 (2017) and is from Caltanissetta, the province&#x27;s capital.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Butera&quot; is debated.

One hypothesis is that the name is of Arabic origin. Butera was called &quot;Butirah&quot; by the Arabs, which means &quot;steep place&quot;. The Arabic demonym &quot;al-Buthayri&quot; was used to refer to a person from Butera (Arabic: &quot;Buthayr&quot;). Butera is also a common name of people in Rwanda (East Africa) where most of men and boys are given this name as a sign of strength.

Another would suggest that the name &quot;Butera&quot; is of Greek origin, and several contemporary scholars tend to reject the Arabic theory of Butera&#x27;s etymology. This is upheld by Giovan Battista Pellegrini, who claims that &quot;The Arabic form for Butera, always with the interdental, should be an indication of a Greek etymon with / d / (the etymological assumptions from Arabic do not satisfy)&quot;. Upholders of a Greek origin for the Butera have suggested that the word may come from &quot;bothèr&quot; (shepherd), &quot;boutherès&quot; (country which permits for summer pasture), &quot;boutyros&quot; (butter merchant) or &quot;bouteron&quot; (butter). B. Pace himself has asserted that the term, aside from &quot;boutherès&quot;, may derive also from the Graeco-Byzantine word &quot;patela&quot; (plain), which refers to Butera&#x27;s location.

==Archaeology==
In the area of &quot;Piano fiera&quot; (a new neighborhood built below the old town) where a prehistoric necropolis still stands, is a construction called &quot;dolmen cysts&quot; made of stone slabs assembled in cubiform manner (a style found also throughout Sardinia). Used also in the Greek period, the monument is associated with cult practices, both Hellenic and indigenous, and characterised by the positioning of human remains inside urns (Gk: enchytrismόs) which, in turn, were placed inside these small chambers.

The history of this territory, at the time of Greek colonization, is not documented by ancient historians, and can only be reconstructed on the basis of archaeological research. Until the eighth century BC the tombs of &quot;Piano fiera&quot; do not show any relationship with the Greek area, but starting from the second half of the seventh century they were associated with rich grave goods imported from Greece.

==History==
The origins of Butera date back to the Early Bronze Age. During the 6th century BC, the town—then likely the Omphace described by Pausanias—was abandoned and was rebuilt only during the period of Timoleon, shortly after the middle of the fourth century BC It was, however, a small village inhabited by farmers, subject to external aggression throughout the early Middle Ages. Butera, being situated close to Gela, one of the most prominent ancient Greek cities of Sicily under Magna Graecia, was itself settled by Greeks, especially from Crete. The dialect spoken in the region was Doric Greek.

Butera was captured by the Aghlabids during the Muslim conquest of Sicily, following a 5-month siege in 853. Out of the three valli of Sicily, it was part of the &quot;Val di Noto&quot;, in the southeastern corner of the island. Following the fall of Butera to the Normans in 1091, the town&#x27;s Muslim leaders were resettled in Calabria to prevent them from fomenting rebellion among the rest of the population. However, a mosque in the town is recorded even in the 12th century, as with certain other Sicilian cities such as Catania, Syracuse, Segesta and Alcamo. It was one of the last Muslim strongholds to fall, due to stubborn resistance, and was described as &quot;one of the strongest outposts of anti-Norman sentiment.&quot; A notable Buteresi of the Norman period was 12th century poet and Quran reciter &#x27;Abd ar-Rahman ibn Muhammed ibn &#x27;Umar al-Buthayri, who wrote: &quot;No life can be serene, save that in the shadows of sweet Sicily.&quot;

Following Butera&#x27;s conquest by the Normans, it became an important Lombard town and indeed was the capital of the prominent under the Aleramici, a noble Northwest Italian family of Frankish origin, as well as the Alagona, an Aragonese family, from 1089 to 1392. Settlers from Northern Italy (including Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria and Emilia-Romagna) as well as southern France migrated to the county, which is reflected in the presence of Gallo-Italic dialects which are still spoken in certain Sicilian towns such as Piazza Armerina and Aidone. Butera itself was re-populated with Swabians from southern Germany following its destruction by William I as a reaction to anti-monarchical resistance in 1161.

In 1392, the Alagona family lost possession of the County following their defeat by Martin I, and was passed to the Catalan prince Ugo of Santapau. In 1543, Ambrogio Santapau was nominated Prince of Butera, after defeating Hayreddin Barbarossa, the Ottoman pirate. Up until the 19th century, this was Sicily&#x27;s main feudal title.

In Butera, 12–13% of the population carries the sickle-cell trait, and its prevalence amongst the town&#x27;s citizens is believed to be due to selective pressure against malaria. While some sources claim that it was introduced by the Muslim conquerors, other scientific studies claim that it was brought by the Greeks. At present, approximately 7% of the surnames in the city (457 out of 1,732) are attributed to a possible Hellenic origin.

==Main sights ==
* Arab-Norman Castle: from the 9th century
* Cathedral: dedicated to Saint Thomas and found in the Piazza Duomo, it was built in the 16th century.
* Sanctuary of San Rocco: built in the 18th century
* Necropolis of Piano della Fiera: in use until the 6th century BC and the Hellenistic phase, its origins date to prehistoric times
* &quot;Porta Reale (Royal Gate)&quot;: given this name because it was entered by Norman count Roger I with a troop of Lombard soldiers
* &quot;Piazza Dante&quot;: the city&#x27;s main square, with the town hall and the Church of S. Giuseppe (St Joseph)
* San Francesco: oldest church in the town, it was founded by the first Norman Christians and became a church of Franciscan friars.
