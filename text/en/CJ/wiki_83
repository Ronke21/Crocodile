<text>A debtors&#x27; prison is a prison for people who are unable to pay debt. Until the mid-19th century, debtors&#x27; prisons (usually similar in form to locked workhouses) were a common way to deal with unpaid debt in Western Europe. Destitute people who were unable to pay a court-ordered judgment would be incarcerated in these prisons until they had worked off their debt via labour or secured outside funds to pay the balance. The product of their labour went towards both the costs of their incarceration and their accrued debt. Increasing access and lenience throughout the history of bankruptcy law have made prison terms for unaggravated indigence obsolete over most of the world.

Since the late 20th century, the term &quot;debtors&#x27; prison&quot; has also sometimes been applied by critics to criminal justice systems in which a court can sentence someone to prison over willfully unpaid criminal fees, usually following the order of a judge. For example, in some jurisdictions within the United States, people can be held in contempt of court and jailed after willful non-payment of child support, garnishments, confiscations, fines, or back taxes. Additionally, though properly served civil duties over private debts in nations such as the United States will merely result in a default judgment being rendered &quot;in absentia&quot; if the defendant willfully declines to appear by law, a substantial number of indigent debtors are legally incarcerated for the crime of failing to appear at civil debt proceedings as ordered by a judge. In this case, the crime is not indigence, but disobeying the judge&#x27;s order to appear before the court. Critics argue that the &quot;willful&quot; terminology is subject to individual &quot;mens rea&quot; determination by a judge, rather than statute, and that since this presents the potential for judges to incarcerate legitimately indigent individuals, it amounts to a de facto &quot;debtors&#x27; prison&quot; system.

==History==

===Medieval Europe===
During Europe&#x27;s Middle Ages, debtors, both men and women, were locked up together in a single, large cell until their families paid their debt. Debt prisoners often died of diseases contracted from others interned in debtors&#x27; prison for many years. Some debt prisoners were released to become serfs or indentured servants (debt bondage) until they paid off their debt in labor.

===Medieval Islamic Middle East===

Imprisonment for debt was also practised in Islam. Debtors who refused to pay their debts could be detained for several months in order to exert pressure on them. If they proved insolvent, they were released before being placed under legal guardianship.

==By region==

===Canada===
===Council of Europe===
Article 1 of Protocol 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibits the imprisonment of people for breach of a contract. Turkey has signed but never ratified Protocol 4.

===France===
Debtor&#x27;s prison, both for private and State debt, was common in Ancien Régime France. It was suppressed during the French Revolution (1793–1797), but later reinstated. The debtor&#x27;s prison for civil debts was abolished in 1867.

France still allows for &quot;contrainte judiciaire&quot;, ordered by a judge, for persons unwilling to pay court-ordered fines as part of a judicial sentence. Older, underage and unsolvable persons are exempted from the &quot;contrainte&quot;. Though France has a rule that no definite proof is required to prove someone guilty of something but a set of proof, thus it’s only required that it’s likely someone is willfully not paying his fine rather than having to prove what exact money he does own, this can lead to someone insolvent being sentenced for being unable to pay his fine as soon as a small mismatch exists between the money being spent and the money on the tax return.

Its length is limited following the amount of the fine and aims to pressure the debtor to pay his fines, consequently the owed money stays owed to the State. After serving a &quot;contrainte&quot;, the debt or fine must still be paid.

===Germany===

In the late Middle Ages, and at the beginning of the modern era, public law was codified in Germany. This served to standardize the coercive arrest (&quot;Pressionshaft&quot;), and got rid of the many arbitrary sanctions that were not universal. In some areas (like Nürnberg) the debtor could sell or redistribute their debt.

In most of the cities, the towers and city fortifications functioned as jails. For certain sanctions there were designated prisons, hence some towers being called debtors&#x27; prison (&quot;Schuldturm&quot;). The term &quot;Schuldturm&quot;, outside of the Saxon constitution, became the catchword for public law debtors&#x27; prison.

In the early modern era, the debtor&#x27;s detainment or citizen&#x27;s arrest remained valid in Germany. Sometimes it was used as a tool to compel payment, other times it was used to secure the arrest of an individual and ensure a trial against them in order to garnish wages, replevin or a form of trover. This practice was particularly disgraceful to a person&#x27;s identity, but had different rules than criminal trials. It was more similar to the modern enforcement of sentences (&quot;Strafvollzug&quot;) e.g. the debtor would be able to work off their debt for a certain number of days, graduated by how much they owed.

The North German Confederation eliminated debtors&#x27; prisons on May 29, 1868.

===Netherlands===
In Dutch law &quot;gijzeling&quot; (lit.: take in as hostage) can be ordered by a judge when people refuse to (appear as) witness, or don&#x27;t pay off their fines or debts. The imprisonment does not cancel the due amount and interest.

===England and Wales===
In England during the 18th and 19th centuries, 10,000 people were imprisoned for debt each year. A prison term did not alleviate a person&#x27;s debt, however; an inmate was typically required to repay the creditor in-full before being released. In England and Wales, debtors&#x27; prisons varied in the amount of freedom they allowed the debtor. With a little money, a debtor could pay for some freedoms; some prisons allowed inmates to conduct business and to receive visitors; others (including the Fleet and King&#x27;s Bench Prisons) even allowed inmates to live a short distance outside the prisona practice known as the &#x27;Liberty of the Rules&#x27;and the Fleet even tolerated clandestine &#x27;Fleet Marriages&#x27;.
Life in these prisons, however, was far from pleasant, and the inmates were forced to pay for their keep. Samuel Byrom, son of the writer and poet John Byrom, was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet in 1725, and in 1729 he sent a petition to his old school friend, the Duke of Dorset, in which he raged against the injustices of the system. Some debtor prisoners were even less fortunate, being sent to prisons with a mixture of vicious criminals and petty criminals, and many more were confined to a single cell.

The father of the English author Charles Dickens was sent to one of these prisons (the Marshalsea), which were often described in Dickens&#x27;s novels. He became an advocate for debt prison reform, and his novel &quot;Little Dorrit&quot; dealt directly with this issue.

The Debtors&#x27; Act 1869 (32 &amp; 33 Vict. c. 62) limited the ability of the courts to sentence debtors to prison, but it did not entirely prohibit them from doing so. Debtors who had the means to pay their debt, but did not do so, could still be incarcerated for up to six weeks, as could those who defaulted on debts to the court. Initially, there was a significant reduction in the number of debtors imprisoned following the passage of the Debtors&#x27; Act 1869. By 1870, the total number of debtors imprisoned decreased by almost 2,000, dropping from 9,759 in 1869 to 6,605 in 1870. However, by 1905 that number had increased to 11,427.

Some of London&#x27;s debtors&#x27; prisons were the Coldbath Fields Prison, Fleet Prison, Giltspur Street Compter, King&#x27;s Bench Prison, Marshalsea Prison, Poultry Compter, and Wood Street Counter. The most famous was the Clink prison, which had a debtor&#x27;s entrance in Stoney Street. This prison gave rise to the British slang term for being incarcerated in any prison, hence &quot;in the clink&quot;. Its location also gave rise to the term for being financially embarrassed, &quot;stoney broke&quot;.

===Scotland===
Imprisonment for the non-payment of debt was competent at Scots common law, but the effect of imprisonment for such stood in marked contrast to the position in England even after the execution of the Treaty of Union in 1707. As Lord Dunedin observed in 1919, it was &#x27;in direct contradistinction to the view of the law in England, that imprisonment was in no sense a satisfaction of the debt&#x27;; the purpose for imprisonment for debt was not to discharge the obligation to pay, but rather to act as a compulsitor to force the debtor into revealing any hidden assets. The Scots law allowing the imprisonment of debtors was grounded in large part by an Act of Sederunt of 23 November 1613, which introduced the process of &#x27;horning&#x27; whereby the creditor would demand the payment of the debt by a certain date. If the debtor did not satisfy the payment of the debt within this stipulated time-period, the creditor could have the debtor &#x27;put to the horn&#x27; by a messenger-at-arms. The execution of horning would have to be registered in the General Register of Hornings in Edinburgh. On registration, a warrant for the arrest of the debtor could then be issued. The formal process of &#x27;horning&#x27; was not formally abolished until the passing of section 89 of the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987 (c. 18), though in practice imprisonment for the non-payment of debts had ceased to be relevant in Scotland since the passing of section 4 of the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1880 (43 &amp; 44 Vict. c. 34). Imprisonment remains competent in cases in which a court order, or order &quot;ad factum praestandum&quot; is breached by a debtor.

While imprisonment for debt was competent in Scots law, it was provided that debtors who were within the bounds of Holyrood Park (the whole of which was deemed a sanctuary) were exempt, and accordingly, till the abolition of imprisonment for debt, many debtors lived in lodgings within the bounds of the park. Such people were subject to the Bailie of the Park, who had power, in certain cases, to imprison them himself, in the Abbey Jail.

=== Greece ===
Ιmprisonment for debts, whether to the tax office or to a private bank, was still practiced until January 2008, when the law changed after imprisonment for unpaid taxes, as well as other debts to the government or to the social security office, was declared unconstitutional after having been practiced for 173 years; imprisonment was, however, still retained for debts to private banks. The situation regarding imprisonment (προσωποκράτηση (prosōpokrátēsē): custody) for debts to the government is still unclear, as courts continue to have this ability for criminal acts.

=== India ===

The Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, as amended, contains provisions for criminal penalties, including imprisonment, if someone defaults on a debt or a payment obligation.

Section 28A of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992 (As amended by the Securities Laws (Amendment) Act, 2014) contains provisions for penalties, including imprisonment, for failure to pay back investors or the authorities.

In India, courts have been known to jail financial defaulters as a way to coerce them to pay back their private creditors, or the state. For example, in the case of Subrata Roy, his bail was conditional on him paying back large sums to the investors or the regulators.

===Malta===

An eighteenth century debtors&#x27; prison is found within the Castellania in Valletta, Malta, now used as offices by the Ministry for Health. It remained in use as a prison until the nineteenth century. In line with the European Convention Act, no person is to be deprived of his liberty because of the incapability to fulfill a contractual obligation.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Debtors in the United Arab Emirates, including Dubai, are imprisoned for failing to pay their debts. This is a common practice in the country. Banks are not sympathetic to the debtors once they are in prison, so many just choose to leave the country where they can negotiate for settlements later. The practice of fleeing UAE to avoid arrest because of debt defaults is considered a viable option to customers who are unable to meet their obligations.

=== United States ===

==== Early debtors&#x27; prisons (colonization–1850) ====

Many Colonial American jurisdictions established debtors&#x27; prisons using the same models used in Great Britain. James Wilson, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, spent some time in a debtors&#x27; prison while still serving as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Fellow signatory Robert Morris spent three years, from 1798 to 1801, in the Prune Street Debtors&#x27; Prison, Philadelphia Henry Lee III, better known as Henry &quot;Light-Horse&quot; Lee, a Revolutionary War general and father of Robert E. Lee, was imprisoned for debt between 1808 and 1809 where he made use of his time by writing &quot;Memoirs of the War&quot;.

Debtors&#x27; prisons were prevalent throughout the United States until the mid-19th century. Economic hardships following the War of 1812 with Great Britain helped swell prison populations with simple debtors. This resulted in significant attention being given to plights of the poor and most dependent jailed under the widespread practice, possibly for the first time. Increasing disfavor over debtors&#x27; prisons along with the advent and early development of U.S. bankruptcy laws led states to begin restricting imprisonment for most civil debts. At that time growing use of the poorhouse and poor farm were also seen as institutional alternatives for debtors&#x27; prisons. The United States ostensibly eliminated the imprisonment of debtors under federal law in 1833
leaving the practice of debtors&#x27; prisons to states.

==== Modern debtors&#x27; prisons (1970–current) ====
While the United States no longer has brick and mortar debtors&#x27; prisons, or &quot;jails for debtors&quot; of private debts, the term &quot;debtor&#x27;s prison&quot; in modern times sometimes refers to the practice of imprisoning indigent criminal defendants for matters related to either a fine or a fee imposed in criminal judgments. To what extent a debtor will actually be prosecuted varies from state to state. This modern use of the term debtors&#x27; prison arguably has its start with precedent rulings in 1970, 1971 and 1983 by the U.S. Supreme Court, and passage of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978.

In 1970, the Court ruled in &quot;Williams v. Illinois&quot; that extending a maximum prison term because a person is too poor to pay fines or court costs violates the right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. During 1971 in &quot;Tate v. Short&quot;, the Court found it unconstitutional to impose a fine as a sentence and then automatically convert it into &quot;a jail term solely because the defendant is indigent and cannot forthwith pay the fine in full.&quot; And in the 1983 ruling for &quot;Bearden v. Georgia,&quot; the Court ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment bars courts from revoking probation for a failure to pay a fine without first inquiring into a person&#x27;s ability to pay and considering whether there are adequate alternatives to imprisonment.

A year-long study released in 2010 of fifteen states with the highest prison populations by the Brennan Center for Justice, found that all fifteen states sampled have jurisdictions that arrest people for failing to pay debt or appear at debt-related hearings. The study identified four causes that lead to debtors&#x27; prison type arrests for debts:
* State laws that attempt to make criminal justice debt a condition of probation, parole, or other correctional supervision with failure to pay resulting in arrest and reimprisonment.
* State laws that consider imprisonment as a penalty for failure to pay criminal justice debt. These actions are considered a civil contempt of court charge, thus technically not in violation of state constitutions that prohibit debtors&#x27; prisons, but for the same reason those incarcerated must be released immediately if they either pay or prove themselves unable to do so.
* Citizens choosing jail time under state programs where imprisonment is a way of paying down court imposed debt.
* States that regularly arrest citizens for criminal justice debt prior to appearing at debt-related hearings, leading in many cases to multi-day jail terms pending an ability to pay hearing.

In an article in &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, Michael Shindler argues that another factor responsible for debtors&#x27; prison type arrests is that &quot;Whereas indigent defendants have a Sixth Amendment right to a court-appointed lawyer in criminal cases involving incarceration, indigent debtors in state and local courts have no one to defend them against the error and abuse that characterizes debt collection litigation.&quot; Similarly, Shindler writes, regarding explicitly illegal debtors&#x27; prison type arrests ordered by local judges,&quot;the reason these officials engage in this sort of excessive behavior is often due to ignorance.&quot;

In a 2019 report by the Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law argues that debtors&#x27; prisons are likely to appear in states like Arkansas where many people live in poverty and are unable to pay fines and fees, where poor record-keeping exacerbates challenges faced by defendants, and where arrest warrants and drivers license suspensions make it even harder for people to pay off court-imposed debt.

==== Modern examples ====
In 2014, National Public Radio (NPR) reported that there were still cases of judges imprisoning people who have not paid court fees. The American Civil Liberties Union has been challenging such policies since 2009.

In September, 2015, in the town of Bowdon, Georgia, a sitting municipal judge, Richard A. Diment, was surreptitiously recorded threatening defendants with jail time for traffic violations if they did not provide immediate payment. The incidents caused the Bowdon Municipal Court to be closed for a month in order to implement changes in policy.

===== Modern U.S. by state =====
== International agreements ==
In 1963, members of the Council of Europe, an intergovernmental human rights organization based in Strasbourg, adopted the Protocol No. 4 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Article 1 of the protocol states that &quot;no one shall be deprived of his liberty merely on the ground of inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.&quot; Currently, 42 states have ratified the protocol.

In 1969 the American Convention on Human Rights, also known as the Pact of San José, was adopted by members of the Organization of American States. Article 7 (7) of the pact affirms &quot;no one shall be detained for debt. This principle shall not limit the orders of a competent judicial authority issued for nonfulfillment of duties of support.&quot; Currently, 24 countries from the Western Hemisphere are parties to that treaty. 

In 1976 Article 11 of the ICCPR – International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights – came into effect stating, &quot;No one shall be imprisoned merely on the ground of inability to fulfill a contractual obligation.&quot;

These international agreements contradict the domestic laws of several ratifying states which allow for imprisonment.

<text>Neil Gaudry (September 19, 1937 – February 18, 1999) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 until his death, sitting as a Liberal.

The son of Véronique Chartrand and Ernest Gaudry, he was born in St. Laurent, Manitoba and was educated there. In 1962, he married Leona Rainville. Before entering public life, Gaudry worked as an accountant and office manager. He was the secretary-treasurer of &quot;Malcolm Construction Ltd.&quot; for twenty-five years, and was active in the community of Interlake before moving to Winnipeg in his later years.

Gaudry was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1988, in the Winnipeg riding of St. Boniface. This historically francophone riding had been represented by Laurent Desjardins almost continuously since 1959; originally a Liberal, Desjardins crossed to the New Democratic Party in 1969 and was re-elected four times under that party&#x27;s banner. Desjardins retired in 1988 when the Manitoba NDP was experiencing a sharp decline in popularity, and Gaudry recaptured St. Boniface for the Liberals with 61 percent of the vote of the vote. The election was won by the Progressive Conservatives, and Gaudry joined 19 other Liberals in the official opposition.

Gaudry was easily elected again in the 1990 election, with only a slightly reduced plurality. His share of the popular vote fell to below 50% in the provincial election of 1995, but he was still re-elected by a nearly 2-to-1 margin over the NDP, despite the Liberals winning only two other seats in the rest of the province.

The Manitoba Liberal Party experienced internal divisions in 1997, due to disgruntlement with the leadership of Ginny Hasselfield. At one stage, Kevin Lamoureux and Gary Kowalski broke from the official party caucus to sit as Independent Liberals; Gaudry was the only Liberal MLA to continue supporting the official party leadership during this period.

Neil Gaudry died of a heart attack on February 18, 1999, while attending the Festival du Voyageur in St. Boniface and the legislature passed a motion of condolence in his memory on April 26 of the same year.

Gaudry frequently championed francophone causes during his time in the legislature. He sought to have Louis Riel recognized as a Father of Confederation, and was an active member in &quot;l&#x27;Assemblee internationale des parlementaires de la langue francaise&quot;. Despite partisan differences, he also assisted the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon on matters relating to francophone education.

<text>A dump truck, known also as a dumping truck, dump trailer, dumper trailer, dump lorry or dumper lorry or a dumper for short, is used for transporting materials (such as dirt, gravel, or demolition waste) for construction as well as coal. A typical dump truck is equipped with an open-box bed, which is hinged at the rear and equipped with hydraulic rams to lift the front, allowing the material in the bed to be deposited (&quot;dumped&quot;) on the ground behind the truck at the site of delivery. In the UK, Australia, South Africa and India the term applies to off-road construction plants only and the road vehicle is known as a tip lorry, tipper lorry (UK, India), tipper truck, tip truck, tip trailer or tipper trailer or simply a tipper (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa).

==History==

The dump truck is thought to have been first conceived in the farms of late 19th century western Europe. Thornycroft developed a steam dust-cart in 1896 with a tipper mechanism. The first motorized dump trucks in the United States were developed by small equipment companies such as The Fruehauf Trailer Corporation, Galion Buggy Co. and Lauth-Juergens among many others around 1910. Hydraulic dump beds were introduced by Wood Hoist Co. shortly after. Such companies flourished during World War I due to massive wartime demand. August Fruehauf had obtained military contracts for his semi-trailer, invented in 1914 and later created the partner vehicle, the semi-truck for use in World War I. After the war, Fruehauf introduced hydraulics in his trailers. They offered hydraulic lift gates, hydraulic winches and a dump trailer for sales in the early 1920s. Fruehauf became the premier supplier of dump trailers and their famed &quot;bathtub dump&quot; was considered to be the best by heavy haulers, road and mining construction firms.

Companies like Galion Buggy Co. continued to grow after the war by manufacturing a number of express bodies and some smaller dump bodies that could be easily installed on either stock or converted (heavy-duty suspension and drivetrain) Model T chassis prior to 1920. Galion and Wood Mfg. Co. built all of the dump bodies offered by Ford on their heavy-duty AA and BB chassis during the 1930s. Galion (now Galion Godwin Truck Body Co.) is the oldest known truck body manufacturer still in operation today.

The first known Canadian dump truck was developed in Saint John, New Brunswick, when Robert T. Mawhinney attached a dump box to a flatbed truck in 1920. The lifting device was a winch attached to a cable that fed over sheave (pulley) mounted on a mast behind the cab. The cable was connected to the lower front end of the wooden dump box which was attached by a pivot at the back of the truck frame. The operator turned a crank to raise and lower the box.

From the 1930s Euclid, International-Harvester and Mack contributed to ongoing development. Mack modified its existing trucks with varying success. In 1934 Euclid became the first manufacturer in the world to successfully produce a dedicated off-highway truck.

==Types==
Today, virtually all dump trucks operate by hydraulics and they come in a variety of configurations each designed to accomplish a specific task in the construction material supply chain.

===Standard dump truck===
A &quot;standard dump truck&quot; is a truck chassis with a dump body mounted to the frame. The bed is raised by a vertical hydraulic ram mounted under the front of the body (known as a front post hoist configuration), or a horizontal hydraulic ram and lever arrangement between the frame rails (known as an underbody hoist configuration), and the back of the bed is hinged at the back of the truck. The tailgate (sometimes referred to as an end gate) can be configured to swing up on top hinges (and sometimes also to fold down on lower hinges) or it can be configured in the &quot;High Lift Tailgate&quot; format wherein pneumatic or hydraulic rams lift the gate open and up above the dump body. Some bodies, typically for hauling grain, have swing-out doors for entering the box and a metering gate/chute in the center for a more controlled dumping.

In the United States most standard dump trucks have one front steering axle and one (4x2 &quot;4-wheeler&quot;) or two (6x4 &quot;6-wheeler&quot;) rear axles which typically have dual wheels on each side. Tandem rear axles are almost always powered, front steering axles are also sometimes powered (4x4, 6x6). Unpowered axles are sometimes used to support extra weight. Most unpowered rear axles can be raised off the ground to minimize wear when the truck is empty or lightly loaded, and are commonly called &quot;lift axles&quot;.

European Union heavy trucks often have two steering axles. Dump truck configurations are two, three, and four axles. The four-axle &quot;eight wheeler&quot; has two steering axles at the front and two powered axles at the rear and is limited to gross weight in most EU countries. The largest of the standard European dump trucks is commonly called a &quot;centipede&quot; and has seven axles. The front axle is the steering axle, the rear two axles are powered, and the remaining four are lift axles.

The shorter wheelbase of a standard dump truck often makes it more maneuverable than the higher capacity semi-trailer dump trucks.

===Semi trailer end dump truck===
A &quot;semi end dump&quot; is a tractor-trailer combination wherein the trailer itself contains the hydraulic hoist. In the US a typical semi end dump has a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with dual tires, in the EU trailers often have 3 axles and single tires. The key advantage of a semi end dump is a large payload. A key disadvantage is that they are very unstable when raised in the dumping position limiting their use in many applications where the dumping location is uneven or off level. Some end dumps make use of an articulated arm (known as a stabilizer) below the box, between the chassis rails, to stabilize the load in the raised position.

Frame and Frameless end dump truck

Depending on the structure, semi trailer end dump truck can also be divided into frame trailer and frameless trailer.

The main difference between them is the different structure. The frame dump trailer has a large beam that runs along the bottom of the trailer to support it. The frameless dump trailer has no frame under the trailer but has ribs that go around the body for support and the top rail of the trailer serves as a suspension bridge for support.

The difference in structure also brings with it a difference in weight. Frame dump trailers are heavier. For the same length, a frame dump trailer weighs around 5 ton more than a frameless dump trailer.

===Transfer dump truck===

A transfer dump truck is a standard dump truck pulling a separate trailer with a movable cargo container, which can also be loaded with construction aggregate, gravel, sand, asphalt, klinkers, snow, wood chips, triple mix, etc.

The second aggregate container on the trailer (&quot;B&quot; box), is powered by an electric motor, a pneumatic motor or a hydraulic line. It rolls on small wheels, riding on rails from the trailer&#x27;s frame into the empty main dump container (&quot;A&quot; box). This maximizes payload capacity without sacrificing the maneuverability of the standard dump truck. Transfer dump trucks are typically seen in the western United States due to the peculiar weight restrictions on highways there.

Another configuration is called a triple transfer train, consisting of a &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; box. These are common on Nevada and Utah Highways, but not in California. Depending on the axle arrangement, a triple transfer can haul up to with a special permit in certain American states. , a triple transfer costs a contractor about $105 an hour, while a A/B configuration costs about $85 per hour.

Transfer dump trucks typically haul between of aggregate per load, each truck is capable of 3–5 loads per day, generally speaking.

===Truck and pup===

A &quot;truck and pup&quot; is very similar to a transfer dump. It consists of a standard dump truck pulling a dump trailer. The pup trailer, unlike the transfer, has its own hydraulic ram and is capable of self-unloading.

===Superdump truck===

A &quot;super dump&quot; is a straight dump truck equipped with a trailing axle, a liftable, load-bearing axle rated as high as . Trailing behind the rear tandem, the trailing axle stretches the outer &quot;bridge&quot; measurement—the distance between the first and last axles—to the maximum overall length allowed. This increases the gross weight allowed under the federal bridge formula, which sets standards for truck size and weight. Depending on the vehicle length and axle configuration, Superdumps can be rated as high as GVW and carry of payload or more. When the truck is empty or ready to offload, the trailing axle toggles up off the road surface on two hydraulic arms to clear the rear of the vehicle. Truck owners call their trailing axle-equipped trucks Superdumps because they far exceed the payload, productivity, and return on investment of a conventional dump truck. The Superdump and trailing axle concept were developed by Strong Industries of Houston, Texas.

===Semi trailer bottom dump truck===

A semi bottom dump, bottom hopper, or belly dump is a (commonly) 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle trailer with a clam shell type dump gate in the belly of the trailer. The key advantage of a semi bottom dump is its ability to lay material in a windrow, a linear heap. In addition, a semi bottom dump is maneuverable in reverse, unlike the double and triple trailer configurations described below. These trailers may be found either of the windrow type shown in the photo or may be of the cross spread type, with the gate opening front to rear instead of left and right. The cross spread type gate will actually spread the cereal grains fairly and evenly from the width of the trailer. By comparison, the windrow-type gate leaves a pile in the middle. The cross spread type gate, on the other hand, tends to jam and may not work very well with coarse materials.

===Double and triple trailer bottom dump truck===
&quot;Double&quot; and &quot;triple bottom dumps&quot; consist of a 2-axle tractor pulling one single-axle semi-trailer and an additional full trailer (or two full trailers in the case of triples). These dump trucks allow the driver to lay material in windrows without leaving the cab or stopping the truck. The main disadvantage is the difficulty in backing double and triple units.

The specific type of dump truck used in any specific country is likely to be closely keyed to the weight and axle limitations of that jurisdiction. Rock, dirt, and other types of materials commonly hauled in trucks of this type are quite heavy, and almost any style of truck can be easily overloaded. Because of that, this type of truck is frequently configured to take advantage of local weight limitations to maximize the cargo. For example, within the United States, the maximum weight limit is throughout the country, except for specific bridges with lower limits. Individual states, in some instances, are allowed to authorize trucks up to . Most states that do so require that the trucks be very long, to spread the weight over more distance. It is in this context that double and triple bottoms are found within the United States.

=== Bumper Pull Dump Trailer ===
Bumper Pull personal and commercial Dump Trailers come in a variety of sizes from smaller 6x10 7,000 GVWR models to larger 7x16 High Side 14,000 GVWR models.

Dump trailers come with a range of options and features such as tarp kits, high side options, dump/spread/swing gates, remote control, scissor, telescop, dual or single cylinder lifts, and metal locking toolboxes. They offer the perfect solution for a variety of applications, including roofing, rock and mulch delivery, general contractors, skid steer grading, trash out, and recycling.

===Side dump truck===

A &quot;side dump truck&quot; (SDT) consists of a 3-axle tractor pulling a 2-axle semi-trailer. It has hydraulic rams that tilt the dump body onto its side, spilling the material to either the left or right side of the trailer. The key advantages of the side dump are that it allows rapid unloading and can carry more weight in the western United States. In addition, it is almost immune to upset (tipping over) while dumping, unlike the semi end dumps which are very prone to tipping over. It is, however, highly likely that a side dump trailer will tip over if dumping is stopped prematurely. Also, when dumping loose materials or cobble sized stone, the side dump can become stuck if the pile becomes wide enough to cover too much of the trailer&#x27;s wheels. Trailers that dump at the appropriate angle (50° for example) avoid the problem of the dumped load fouling the path of the trailer wheels by dumping their loads further to the side of the truck, in some cases leaving sufficient clearance to walk between the dumped load and the trailer.

===Winter service vehicles===

Many &quot;winter service vehicles&quot; are based on dump trucks, to allow the placement of ballast to weigh the truck down or to hold sodium or calcium chloride salts for spreading on snow and ice-covered surfaces. Plowing is severe service and needs heavy-duty trucks.

===Roll-off trucks===
A &quot;Roll-off&quot; has a hoist and subframe, but no body, it carries removable containers. The container is loaded on the ground, then pulled onto the back of the truck with a winch and cable. The truck goes to the dumpsite, after it has been dumped the empty container is taken and placed to be loaded or stored. The hoist is raised and the container slides down the subframe so the rear is on the ground. The container has rollers on the rear and can be moved forward or back until the front of it is lowered onto the ground. The containers are usually open-topped boxes used for rubble and building debris, but rubbish compactor containers are also carried. A newer hook-lift system (&quot;roller container&quot; in the UK) does the same job, but lifts, lowers, and dumps the container with a boom arrangement instead of a cable and hoist.

===Off-highway dump trucks===

Off-highway dump trucks are heavy construction equipment and share little resemblance to highway dump trucks. Bigger off-highway dump trucks are used strictly off-road for mining and heavy dirt hauling jobs. There are two primary forms: rigid frame and articulating frame.

The term &quot;dump&quot; truck is not generally used by the mining industry, or by the manufacturers that build these machines. The more appropriate U.S. term for this strictly off-road vehicle is &quot;haul truck&quot; and the equivalent European term is &quot;dumper&quot;.

====Haul truck====

Haul trucks are used in large surface mines and quarries. They have a rigid frame and conventional steering with drive at the rear wheel. As of late 2013, the largest ever production haul truck is the 450 metric ton BelAZ 75710, followed by the Liebherr T 282B, the Bucyrus MT6300AC and the Caterpillar 797F, which each have payload capacities of up to . The previous record holder being the Canadian-built Terex 33-19 &quot;Titan&quot;, having held the record for over 25 years. Most large-size haul trucks employ Diesel-electric powertrains, using the Diesel engine to drive an AC alternator or DC generator that sends electric power to electric motors at each rear wheel. The Caterpillar 797 is unique for its size, as it employs a Diesel engine to power a mechanical powertrain, typical of most road-going vehicles and intermediary size haul trucks. 
Other major manufacturers of haul trucks include SANY, XCMG, Hitachi, Komatsu, DAC, Terex, and BelAZ.

====Articulated hauler====

An articulated dumper is an all-wheel-drive, off-road dump truck. It has a hinge between the cab and the dump box but is distinct from a semi-trailer truck in that the power unit is a permanent fixture, not a separable vehicle. Steering is accomplished via hydraulic cylinders that pivot the entire tractor in relation to the trailer, rather than rack and pinion steering on the front axle as in a conventional dump truck. By this way of steering, the trailer&#x27;s wheels follow the same path as the front wheels. Together with all-wheel drive and low center of gravity, it is highly adaptable to rough terrain. Major manufacturers include Volvo CE, Terex, John Deere, and Caterpillar.

===U-shaped dump truck===
U-shaped dump trucks, also known as tub-body trucks, is used to transport construction waste, it is made of high-strength super wear-resistant special steel plate directly bent, and has the characteristics of impact resistance, alternating stress resistance, corrosion resistance and so on.

1. Cleaner unloading
U-shaped dump truck, there is no dead angle at the corners of the cargo box, it is not easy to stick to the box when unloading, and the unloading is cleaner.

2. Lightweight
The U-shaped cargo box reduces its own weight through structural optimization. Now the most common U-shaped dump is to use high-strength plates. Under the premise of ensuring the strength of the car body, the thickness of the plate is reduced by about 20%, and the self-weight of the car is reduced by about 1 ton, which effectively improves the utilization factor of the load mass.

3. Strong carrying capacity. Using high-strength steel plate, high yield strength, better impact resistance and fatigue resistance. For users of ore transportation, it can reduce the damage of ore to the container.

4. Low center of gravity The U-shaped structure has a lower center of gravity, which makes the ride more stable, especially when cornering, and avoids spilling cargo.

5. Save tires The U-shaped cargo box can keep the cargo in the center, and the tires on both sides are more evenly stressed, which is beneficial to improve the life of the tires.

==Dangers==

===Collisions===
Dump trucks are normally built for some amount of off-road or construction site driving; as the driver is protected by the chassis and height of the driver&#x27;s seat, bumpers are either placed high or omitted for added ground clearance. The disadvantage is that in a collision with a standard car, the entire motor section or luggage compartment goes under the truck. Thus, the passengers in the car could be more severely injured than would be common in a collision with another car. Several countries have made rules that new trucks should have bumpers approximately above ground in order to protect other drivers. There are also rules about how long the load or construction of the truck can go beyond the rear bumper to prevent cars that rear-end the truck from going under it.

===Tipping===
Another safety consideration is the leveling of the truck before unloading. If the truck is not parked on relatively horizontal ground, the sudden change of weight and balance due to lifting of the body and dumping of the material can cause the truck to slide, or even to tip over. The live bottom trailer is an approach to eliminate this danger.

===Back-up accidents===
Because of their size and the difficulty of maintaining visual contact with on-foot workers, dump trucks can be a threat, especially when backing up. Mirrors and back-up alarms provide some level of protection, and having a spotter working with the driver also decreases back-up injuries and fatalities.

<text>June Muriel Brown (16 February 1927 – 3 April 2022) was an English actress and author. She was best known for her role as Dot Cotton on the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1985–1993; 1997–2020). In 2005, she won Best Actress at the &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards and received the Lifetime Achievement award at the 2005 British Soap Awards. Brown was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours for services to drama and to charity, and promoted to an OBE in the 2022 New Year Honours. In 2009, she was nominated for the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress, making her the second performer to receive a BAFTA nomination for their work in a soap opera, after Jean Alexander. In February 2020, at the age of 93, she announced that she had left &quot;EastEnders&quot; permanently.

== Early life ==
Brown was born on 16 February 1927 in Needham Market, Suffolk, one of five children of Louisa Ann (née Butler) and Henry William Melton Brown. Her ancestry included English, Irish and Scottish, and from her maternal grandmother, Sephardic Jewish (from Algeria, the Netherlands and Italy). Through her grandmother, she was descended from the noted Jewish bare-knuckle boxer Isaac Bitton.

Brown was educated at St John&#x27;s Church of England School in Ipswich and then won a scholarship to Ipswich High School, where she passed the school certificate examinations. During the Second World War, she was evacuated to the Welsh village of Pontyates in Carmarthenshire. During the later years of the war, she served in the Wrens and was classically trained at the Old Vic Theatre School in Lambeth, London.

== Career ==
=== Film and television ===
Brown had a long television career, appearing on three episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; as Mrs Parsons (1970–71); the &quot;Play for Today&quot;, &quot;Edna, the Inebriate Woman&quot; as Clara (1971); the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; as Lady Eleanor (1973–74); the nursing soap &quot;Angels&quot;; the history-of-Britain &quot;Churchill&#x27;s People&quot;; long-running comedy drama &quot;Minder&quot;; the police drama soap &quot;The Bill&quot;; and cult sci-fi series &quot;Survivors&quot;. She had a bigger part as Mrs Leyton in the costume drama &quot;The Duchess of Duke Street&quot; (1976), and played Mrs Mann in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1985).

She also played Nanny Slagg in the BBC&#x27;s big-budget production of &quot;Gormenghast&quot; in 2000. She was cast in small roles in several movies, appearing as the grieving mother of an undead biker in British horror flick &quot;Psychomania&quot; (1971), as well as &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971), &quot;Sitting Target&quot; (1972), &quot;The 14&quot; (1973), &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; (1979), &quot;Nijinsky&quot; (1980), &quot;The Mambo Kings&quot; (1992) and the &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; movie spin-off &quot;Bean&quot; (1997). She also appeared as Tom Hedden&#x27;s wife in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot; (1971), although her scenes were cut from the film. In 1984, she featured in the TV mini-series &quot;Lace&quot; which starred actress Phoebe Cates.

In 2006, Brown appeared as Aunt Spiker at the Children&#x27;s Party at the Palace, an all-star event to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s 80th birthday. In 2010, Brown took part in the annual Christmas special of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. Brown said &quot;I&#x27;m terrified and apprehensive about what I&#x27;ve let myself in for, I must be barmy and I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s come over me ... I just hope I can remember the steps to the routines. I&#x27;m looking forward to working with the professional dancers and the other contestants.&quot; Her dancing partner was Vincent Simone, with whom she danced the tango.

In August 2011 she was featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, and was the oldest person to have appeared on the programme.

In July 2012, Brown hosted a documentary for the BBC called &quot;Respect Your Elders&quot;, which looked at society&#x27;s treatment and attitudes towards the elderly.

=== Theatre ===
Brown was also active in British theatre. She directed and starred in &quot;Pin Money&quot; by Malcolm Needs in London, and &quot;Double D&quot; by Matthew Westwood in Edinburgh and London. She played Mrs Danvers in a touring production of &quot;Rebecca&quot;. Other plays include &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot;, &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot;, &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot;, and numerous pantomimes. During her early career, she played the roles of Hedda Gabler and Lady Macbeth. 

In 2009, Brown played Jessie in the West End production of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; at the Noël Coward Theatre. Also in the play were former &quot;EastEnders&quot; stars Anita Dobson (Angie Watts), Jill Halfpenny (Kate Mitchell) and Jack Ryder (Jamie Mitchell).

Brown was recommended to producers for the role of Dot Cotton in &quot;EastEnders&quot; by one of its original cast members, Leslie Grantham, who played Den Watts. Brown played the role from 1985 to 2020, with a break between 1993 and 1997.

On 31 January 2008, aged 80, Brown became the first and, to date, only soap actor to carry an entire episode single-handed. The episode featured a monologue looking back over her character&#x27;s life, dictated to a cassette machine for her husband Jim to listen to in hospital following a stroke. The fact that co-star and close friend John Bardon (who played Jim) was recovering from a stroke in real life added extra pathos to the episode. In 2009, Brown was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. Brown&#x27;s nomination came as a result of her &quot;single-hander&quot; episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the director of which she praised.

On 30 April 2012, it was announced that Brown was to take a six-month break from &quot;EastEnders&quot; and planned to write her autobiography during her time off. In October 2012, it was announced she had returned to filming, and she appeared on screen again from January 2013. Her autobiography, &quot;Before the Year Dot&quot;, was published in 2013.

In May 2015, Brown revealed that her eyesight was failing due to macular degeneration. Later, in 2016, a storyline for Dot in which her eyesight was deteriorating was introduced. Speaking about the condition in April 2019, Brown said that it had worsened since undergoing surgery in 2017, and that she no longer went out socially because of her eyesight: &quot;I never go to soap awards or suchlike now. I don&#x27;t recognise people that I know and they would think I was snubbing them.&quot;

On 20 February 2020, Brown announced that she had left &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1950, Brown met and married actor John Garley; he suffered from depression and died by suicide in 1957. In 1958, she married actor Robert Arnold. They had six children in seven years, one of whom died in infancy. The couple were together for 45 years, until he died in 2003 of Lewy-body dementia. Thereafter, she lived alone in Surrey.

Brown was a supporter of the Conservative Party and told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2009, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t vote Labour, dear, if you paid me. I vote Conservative.&quot; Like her &quot;EastEnders&quot; character, she was a Christian.

Brown was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2022 New Year Honours, both for services to drama and to charity.

==Death==
Brown died on 3 April 2022, aged 95. On the announcement of her death, the following day, &quot;EastEnders&quot; paid tribute to Brown and posted condolences from several of her former co-stars on social media, including Gillian Taylforth, Natalie Cassidy, Lacey Turner, Diane Parish, Emma Barton, Shona McGarty, Adam Woodyatt and Letitia Dean. The episode broadcast that evening was dedicated to her memory. Following this, the documentary &quot;June Brown: A Walford Legend&quot;, which originally aired in 2017, to celebrate Brown&#x27;s 90th birthday, and her 2011 episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;, were aired on BBC One, in a change to the original schedule.

<text>Mount Liang is a mountain in Liangshan County, Shandong, China, which rises to 197.9 metres above sea level. It is well known as the stronghold of the 108 Heroes in the classic Chinese novel &quot;Water Margin&quot;. The modern Liangshan County is located a few kilometres to the north and 80 kilometres west of the Beijing–Shanghai railway.

The original Mount Liang was named after the Prince of Liang (), a son of Emperor Wen of the Han dynasty. After his death, the prince was buried on the mountain. The area was from prehistoric times surrounded by the largest marshland in North China, called the Daye Marsh and later the Liangshan Marsh. During the Song dynasty, the Yellow River flowed through the area. Mount Liang was located at the extreme north of what became known as the &quot;eight hundred &quot;li&quot; moorage of Mount Liang&quot;. Because the area was largely a wasteland on the frontiers of several administrative units, government control was minimal. It is known that outlaws and bandits were active in the area during the Song dynasty, although Song Jiang – a major character in &quot;Water Margin&quot; – was not associated with the area. Some of the bandits on Mount Liang preyed selectively upon the rich and became known as &quot;righteous bandits&quot; (義匪; &quot;yì fěi&quot;). Legends about the heroes of Mount Liang, which provided the basis for &quot;Water Margin&quot;, probably formed from this historical context. Banditry continued on Mount Liang until the mid-17th century, when the Qing dynasty established a military garrison in present-day Liangshan County.

&quot;Water Margin&quot; describes Mount Liang in majestic terms, imagining its peak to be a plateau ringed by high mountains and protected by six passes and eight fortresses. The Yuan dynasty &quot;zaju&quot; &quot;Black Whirlwind Presents Two Victories&quot; () envisages Mount Liang as having &quot;72 deep rivers, garrisoned with hundreds of warships. In 36 feasting towers, there is enough food for a million soldiers and their mounts.&quot;
When the Yellow River shifted course in 1289, the marshes around Mount Liang shrank considerably. During the Ming dynasty, it had been reduced to five smaller marshlands. After the Yellow River shifted back to its northern course in 1853, the marshes were gradually filled in by sediments carried downstream by the river and human land reclamation. Today, the relatively small Dongping Lake is what remains of the great marshes.

Considerable effort has been made in recent years to develop Liangshan as a destination for tourists. A number of buildings have been erected to match descriptions given in &quot;Water Margin&quot;.

<doc id="1110028" wikidata="Q7380451" url="?curid=1110028" title="Ruputer">
<text>The Ruputer is a wristwatch computer developed in 1998 by Seiko Instruments, a subsidiary of the Seiko Group. It was introduced on 10 June 1998. In the US, it was later marketed as the onHand PC by Matsucom.

The Ruputer has a 16-bit, 3.6 MHz processor and 2 MB of non-volatile storage memory and 128 KB of RAM. Its display is a 102×64 pixel monochrome LCD. Its main forms of input are a tiny 8-direction joystick and 6 function buttons. It also has a serial interface and an IR port for communicating with other devices. The main body of the device (separate from the strap) is roughly 2 inches wide, 1 1/8 inches across, and 5/8 of an inch deep. It is powered by two high-powered watch batteries, which supply the device enough energy for approximately 30 hours of use. Under normal conditions, the watch goes into standby mode down when not in use in order to extend its battery life. The device was distributed with a software development kit which allows for creation of new software written in the programming language C.

==onHand PC==
The successor to the Ruputer is the onHand PC. The onHand PC was available in two color styles, clear &amp; black, and a single format. While the Ruputer was available with either 512 KB of storage (original Ruputer), 2 MB (Ruputer PRO), or 4 MB of flash memory (Ruputer PRO4), the onHand PC came only in a single version with 2 MB of storage. The operating system is known as W-PS-DOS version 1.16. The device features both an icon-based GUI and a text-based user interface. There is 128 KB of RAM, with an additional 128 KB of ROM.

On the device, data can be entered by two methods: The first method is by using the joystick mounted to the front of the watch itself (a method that has been considered clumsy). The second method is by synchronizing data from a full-sized PC using the included software. A program called HandySurf also allows synchronizing internet content (such as Yahoo! News Headlines).

Communication with other devices is either through a 38,400-bit/s serial port dock, or through the 9,600 infrared link, the transmitter of which is mounted to the upper middle of the watch. It is possible to link two onHands via this infrared link to play various two-player games.

The watch uses two lithium CR2025 button cells for power, which can be accessed from the back of the device. The batteries give the user an average 3 months of usage before battery replacement. Many users have found that the CR2032 cells fit, which give the device a longer run time. The device&#x27;s screen is a 102x64 STN 4-greyscale LCD which uses a timed backlight to save power.

The device weighs about , similar that of a large electronic standard watch.
Considering the type of system there is a fair amount of software available, although some of the programs written for the Ruputer are either entirely in Kanji script or will not run due to the increased speed of the onHand&#x27;s processor.

One developer has made a prototype for a docking station for the watch that includes a screen illuminator and a half-keyboard. This is not a commercial product, but instructions are available as to how to create such a device.

The onHand PC was discontinued by Matsucom on April 7, 2006.

==Response==
The Ruputer and onHand PC failed to achieve widespread success, for a number of reasons. First, their screen is too small to display more than a handful of text, making it awkward to view data. Second, their joystick input requires entering text in a process similar to that of entering one&#x27;s initials in an arcade game high-score list. Finally, they run through their non-rechargeable batteries more swiftly than is convenient for a device meant to be worn as a timepiece, although it was later found that the slightly larger CR2032 battery can be used which gives substantially better battery life.

The main competitor for the onHand PC was the Fossil Wrist PDA, a wristwatch-sized PDA. The device runs Palm OS 4.1., and like other Palm OS devices, has a virtual keyboard and touch-sensitive screen with handwriting recognition, giving the Wrist PDA an advantage over the joystick input on the onHand PC. The Wrist PDA features 8 MB of memory, four times the memory in the onHand, although a major disadvantage of the Fossil device was volatile memory - if the battery died, data was lost. The Ruputer/onHand uses non-volatile storage, which is not battery-dependent, so data is retained even through battery death.

<doc id="1110029" wikidata="Q7834902" url="?curid=1110029" title="Transport Workers Act 1928">
<text>The &quot;Transport Workers Act 1928&quot; (Cth), more widely known as the Dog Collar Act, was a law passed by the Australian Parliament. It achieved royal assent on 24 September 1928, after being instigated and introduced to Parliament by the Bruce government (Nationalist Government of Stanley Bruce). It was ostensibly &quot;relating to employment in relation to trade and commerce with other countries and among the states&quot;, which mirrors the wording of Section 51(i) of the Constitution of Australia.

== Background ==
Following a review of the establishing act of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration (the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904), the government required that the court consider the economic effect of its industrial awards and that mandatory court-supervised ballots.

== Act ==
The Act required all waterfront workers to hold federal licences, or &quot;dog collars&quot; as they were derisively known, to work. The Act allowed the Commonwealth government, by regulation, to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation. The government favoured employment of non-union labour and members of the Permanent &amp; Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia.

== Amendments ==
The Act was amended in 1929 and 1937, by the &quot;Transport Workers Act 1929&quot; (Cth) and the &quot;Transport Workers Act 1939&quot; (Cth).

== Legacy ==
The Chifley Labor government replaced the Act on 22 December 1947 with the &quot;Stevedoring Industry Act 1947&quot;, which was itself amended in 1948 and replaced with the &quot;Stevedoring Industry Act 1949&quot;, which was in turn amended in 1954 and replaced by the &quot;Stevedoring Industry Act 1956&quot;. All Acts in this series were repealed in 1977.

<doc id="1110038" wikidata="Q6193265" url="?curid=1110038" title="Jim &amp; Ingrid Croce">
<text>Jim &amp; Ingrid Croce is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter Jim Croce and American author Ingrid Croce, the only one the married couple released as a duo. It was originally released in September 1969, and has been subsequently re-released with alternate titles such as &quot;Bombs over Puerto Rico&quot;, &quot;Another Day, Another Town&quot; and &quot;Approaching Day&quot;.

The album was released in September 1969, despite being recorded 12 months earlier. In the interim, the couple recorded 21 songs as a demonstration tape to audition for a children TV show in Boston. They did not get the job; these demo tapes were not released until 2004 when seven tracks were selected to be included with the 2004 CD release of the 1966 album &quot;Facets&quot;. In the CD liner notes, Ingrid refers to this collection of songs as &quot;Jim and Ingrid Croce Too&quot;.

==Track listing==

The album was re-released on Capitol Records as &quot;Jim &amp; Ingrid Croce: Another Day Another Town&quot;, with two songs omitted and the tracks rearranged in the following order:
==Personnel==
*Jim Croce – guitar, keyboards, vocals, 12-string guitar
*Ingrid Croce – vocals
*Gary Chester – drums
*Harry Katzman – violin
*Ann Minogue – triangle
*Gene Pistilli – guitar, keyboards
*John Stockfish – bass
*Eric Weissberg – mandolin
*Dick Weissman – banjo
*Tommy West – guitar, keyboards, backing vocals

On stage, she starred in the West End production of &quot;High School Musical&quot; in 2008, and in the UK touring production of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; in 2010.

==Early life==
Dean was born in Potters Bar to parents Leslie (a tailor) and Ellie Dean, in a cottage rented on the estate of the romantic novelist Barbara Cartland, known as Camfield Place. Dean has two older brothers.

Dean&#x27;s family moved to the village of Stoke Goldington, near Newport Pagnell in Buckinghamshire, when she was three years old. She acquired a penchant for performing at an early age; both she and her older brother Stephen attended a local dance school, the Sylvia Mitchell School of Dance, and they also performed a dance act together on stage. This later prompted Dean&#x27;s successful application to attend the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts at ten years old, and later the Sylvia Young Theatre School in Marylebone, London.

==Career==
===Early career===
Dean began performing professionally at the age of 12, when she was cast as Pepper in the musical &quot;Annie&quot; at London&#x27;s Victoria Palace Theatre. A trained singer, she played the lead female, Sandy, in the musical &quot;Grease&quot;, and also sang with a rock group called The Young Uns, who toured the country supporting stage acts such as Bobby Davro and Tom O&#x27;Connor.

Between the ages of 13 and 17, Dean appeared in numerous television programmes, including: &quot;Love Story&quot;; &quot;Tales Out Of School&quot;; the Matthew Kelly sitcom &quot;Relative Strangers&quot;; &quot;Grange Hill&quot;, playing a student named Lucinda Oliver (credited as Titia Dean); and the role of Dawn in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot;.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
In 1984, Dean auditioned to play one of the original characters in BBC One&#x27;s new soap opera, &quot;EastEnders&quot;; she was selected for an interview on the strength of a photograph alone. The creators of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Tony Holland and Julia Smith, were looking for a &quot;bouncy, attractive, oddly vulnerable young woman&quot; to play the part of Sharon Watts, and out of the various applicants they had seen, they believed that only Dean had all of those qualities. Dean lied about her roots to get the part. As the casting directors were only looking for real East End actors, she falsely claimed that she was born and brought up in Hackney, east London. The lie paid off and she got the part, clinching the deal because of her laugh, which Holland and Smith described as &quot;the dirtiest in the world!&quot; She debuted in the role in the show&#x27;s first episode broadcast on 19 February 1985.

Dean&#x27;s character Sharon, the troubled and spoilt adopted daughter of landlords &quot;Dirty&quot; Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), has become one of the most popular and long-running characters in the serial. She featured in one of the soap&#x27;s most popular storylines in 1994, a love triangle featuring Sharon, her husband Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp) and his brother Phil (Steve McFadden). The plot, nicknamed &quot;Sharongate&quot;, gave the soap one of its highest episode ratings in October 1994 with over 25.3 million viewers. A desire to pursue other acting roles prompted Dean to leave the soap in 1995.

During her first stint on &quot;EastEnders&quot;, she forayed into singing with her fellow &quot;EastEnders&quot; castmate, Paul Medford (who played Kelvin Carpenter). A song penned for the pair as part of a plotline in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (known as The Banned) prompted the BBC to release the song as a single. The song, &quot;Something Outa Nothing&quot;, reached number 12 in the UK singles chart in November 1986.

Six years following her initial exit, Dean was lured back to &quot;EastEnders&quot; by producer John Yorke, reprising the role of Sharon from 2001 to 2006. In December 2004, &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; reported that executive producer Kathleen Hutchison offered to double Dean&#x27;s salary from £150,000 a year to £300,000 a year, to persuade her to remain in the show, making her one of the highest paid actresses in British soap. Dean&#x27;s character left the serial again in January 2006. Her exit was announced in August 2005 and an official &quot;EastEnders&quot; press report initially stated that she was only taking a scheduled break and was due back on set later in 2006; however, this did not happen, and in June 2006 the BBC denied press speculation that there were any immediate plans for her to return to the series.

In February 2012, producer Bryan Kirkwood announced that Dean would make a second return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;, having been absent for a period of six years. She made her return on 13 August 2012 after fleeing from her wedding to her fiancé John Hewland, with her son, Dennis Rickman Jr. and Phil Mitchell. She is one of three remaining original cast members, along with Gillian Taylforth and Adam Woodyatt.

===Other work===
Away from &quot;EastEnders&quot; Dean has had various theatre and television roles. She starred in two seasons of the BBC drama &quot;The Hello Girls&quot;, set in a Derby telephone exchange in the 1960s; medical dramas &quot;Casualty&quot; and &quot;Doctors&quot;; the ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot;; romantic comedy &quot;Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married&quot;, and the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; as a weathergirl. She also starred in the 1995 film &quot;England, My England&quot;, which told the story of the musician and court composer Henry Purcell.

On stage, she starred as Nurse Fay in the Joe Orton comedy play, &quot;Loot&quot;, working alongside actor Michael Elphick. She also played a prostitute in the revival of Charles Dyer&#x27;s 1960s play &quot;Rattle of a Simple Man&quot; at the Alexandra Theatre, Birmingham.

In 2007, Dean participated in the fifth series of the BBC celebrity dance contest, &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. She was partnered with the professional dancer, Darren Bennett. Dean and Bennett were voted out in the quarter-finals (week 10), one week before the semi-final. Commenting on her experience, Dean said &quot;It&#x27;s been incredible. I&#x27;ve got to thank [Darren Bennett] for all his patience, hard work, all the injuries. It&#x27;s been wonderful.&quot; Dean was one of several celebrities who took part in the 2008 &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; UK arena tour. The tour began in January 2008 and visited various venues throughout the UK, with all the proceeds going to the &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal.

In April 2008, it was announced that she would be starring in the stage show &quot;High School Musical&quot; as Ms Darbus. Dean commented, &quot;It&#x27;s a lovely opportunity for me [...] It&#x27;s something completely different to anything I&#x27;ve ever done – doing an American accent and playing this kind of character.&quot; The production played at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Apollo from June 2008 until 31 August 2008.

In January 2009, Dean released a fitness DVD entitled &quot;Letitia Dean&#x27;s Lean Routine&quot;. She joined the cast of the stage production of &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; the same year, playing Cora (Miss July).

====Pantomimes====
As well as television and theatre work, Dean regularly appears in seasonal pantomimes; she was reported to have a special clause in her &quot;EastEnders&quot; contract that permits her time off from filming to star in a pantomime each year. In 2001, she starred in &quot;Snow White&quot; at the Orchard in Dartford; and in 2004, she starred in &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Birmingham Hippodrome, alongside British comedians Joe Pasquale and Don Maclean. In 2006, Dean appeared as the wicked witch in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at the Deco, Northampton, taking over the role from her &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star, Gillian Taylforth, who pulled out due to ill health. December 2007 saw her appear as the Fairy godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot;, at the Regent Theatre, Ipswich. In December 2008, she appeared as the Wicked Queen in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at the Grove Theatre in Dunstable, and she played the role again at the Ashcroft Theatre in Croydon in 2009.

===Awards===
In 2004, Dean was nominated for Best Actress and Best Dramatic Performance at the British Soap Awards. At the 2005 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; awards, she was presented with the award for outstanding achievement as homage to her work in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. She was also nominated in the category of Best Couple (shared with Nigel Harman). In 2022, Dean won the Outstanding Achievement award at the British Soap Awards.

==Personal life==
Growing up in the public eye was reportedly hard for Dean, and the constant media attention on her appearance was something she found especially tough. Dean says her self-confidence was damaged during this time, and this, as well as back pain, contributed to her decision to get a breast reduction in her teens. By her 30s, she considered herself to be a lot more comfortable in her own skin, and far more relaxed about public interest than she used to be as a teenager, commenting: &quot;I have stopped pleasing people – and I&#x27;m calmer and more self assured than I&#x27;ve ever been.&quot;

In 2001, Dean became engaged to jobbing actor Jason Pethers after knowing him for only a few months. They married in September 2002 at All Saints&#x27; Church in Marylebone. Her close friend and &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star, Susan Tully, was a bridesmaid at the wedding. Many of Dean&#x27;s fellow castmates from &quot;EastEnders&quot; attended the wedding. After five years of marriage, it was announced in 2007 that Dean and Pethers had separated because Pethers was reluctant to have children.

As well as acting, Dean is a keen singer (with a mezzo-soprano voice) and tap dancer. She currently lives in the Bedfordshire village of Wootton.

In June 2022, when accepting an award at the British Soap Awards, she revealed that her father had died and she dedicated the award to him.

===Charity work===
In 1997, Dean, along with Susan Tully, was involved with the Third World charity Plan International; they were sent to a remote village in Senegal to help highlight one of the organisation&#x27;s aid projects, designed to bring running water to drought-hit areas.

<text>October Sky is a 1999 American biographical drama film directed by Joe Johnston, and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, Chris Owen, and Laura Dern. The screenplay by Lewis Colick, based on the book of the same name, tells the story of Homer H. Hickam Jr., a coal miner&#x27;s son who was inspired by the launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; in 1957 to take up rocketry against his father&#x27;s wishes and eventually became a NASA engineer.

&quot;October Sky&quot; is based on the lives of four young men who grew up in Coalwood, West Virginia. Principal photography took place in rural East Tennessee, including Oliver Springs, Harriman and Kingston in Morgan and Roane counties. The film was a moderate box office success and received very positive critical reception. It continues to be celebrated in the regions of its setting and filming.

&quot;October Sky&quot; is an anagram of &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;, the title of the 1998 memoir upon which the film is based. It is also used in a period radio broadcast describing &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; as it crossed the &quot;October Sky&quot;. Homer Hickam said that &quot;Universal Studios marketing people got involved and they just had to change the title because, according to their research, women over thirty would never see a movie titled &quot;Rocket Boys&quot;.&quot; The book was later re-released with the name in order to capitalize on interest in the film.

==Plot==
In October 1957, news of the Soviet Union&#x27;s launch of &quot;Sputnik 1&quot; reaches Homer Hickam in the mining community of Coalwood, West Virginia, who is inspired to build his own rockets despite the skepticism of his friends and family, especially his father; John Hickam, who strictly wanted Homer to work in the mines.

Homer teams up with math geek Quentin Wilson, who shares an interest in aerospace engineering; with the support of friends Roy Lee Cooke and Sherman O&#x27;Dell, and their science teacher Freida J. Riley, they construct small rockets. When one of their rockets lands near John&#x27;s office and nearly injures some workers, John reprimands Homer not to build rockets on his property again. The boys hike to the edge of the coal company&#x27;s property, where they succeed with the help of the townsfolk, including the mine&#x27;s machine shop manager, Ike Bykovsky, who is punished by John for helping the boys and sent to work in the mine.

The rocket launches begin attracting townsfolk. However, the boys abandon rocketry after they are accused by the police of starting a wildfire with a stray rocket and are arrested. In a mining accident, John is injured and Bykovsky is killed, devastating Homer. He drops out of high school to work in the mine and provide for his family while his father recovers.

Homer is inspired by Miss Riley to read a book on applied rocket science, learning to calculate the trajectory of a rocket. Using this, he and Quentin locate their missing rocket and prove it could not have caused the fire. The boys present their findings to Miss Riley and the school principal, Mr. Turner, who determines the cause was a flare from a nearby airfield. Homer tells his father he is returning to high school and no longer wants to work in the mine. The boys return to rocketry and win the school science fair. When the opportunity arises for one of them to participate in the National Science Fair in Indianapolis, they elect Homer. The miner&#x27;s union goes on strike against the coal company. With the mines set to close and resenting his father&#x27;s pressures, Homer storms out of the house, vowing never to return.

At the National Science Fair, Homer&#x27;s display is well-received. Overnight, someone steals his machined rocket part model – the de Laval nozzle – and his autographed picture of Dr. Wernher von Braun. Homer makes an urgent phone call home to his mother Elsie, who implores John to end the strike so that Mr. Bolden, Bykovsky&#x27;s replacement, can use the machine shop to build a replacement nozzle. John relents when Elsie, fed up with his lack of support for their son, threatens to leave him. With the town&#x27;s support and replacement parts sent to Indianapolis, the boys win the top prize and Homer is bombarded with college scholarship offers.

He returns to Coalwood as a hero and visits Miss Riley, who is dying of Hodgkin lymphoma. Preparing for the launch of their largest rocket yet, Homer asks his father to come and tells him that Von Braun is brilliant but is not his hero—implying John is his true idol. At the launch of their rocket, named for Miss Riley, almost all of Coalwood turns out to watch. John is given the honor of pushing the launch button. The &quot;Miss Riley&quot; reaches an altitude of – higher than the summit of Mount Everest. As the town looks to the skies, John puts his hand on Homer&#x27;s shoulder and smiles, showing Homer that he is proud of him.

An epilogue reveals the real-life outcomes of the main characters&#x27; lives, noting that Miss Riley died, the mine closed, and all four Rocket Boys went to college, going on to successful careers, with Homer working at NASA.

==Cast==
==Production==
Filming began on February 23, 1998, almost a year before the film&#x27;s release. Although it takes place in West Virginia, Tennessee was the location of choice for filming in part because of the weather and area terrain. Film crews reconstructed the sites to look like the 1957 mining town setting the movie demanded. The weather in East Tennessee gave the filmmakers trouble and delayed the production of the film. Cast and crew recalled the major weather shifts and tornadoes in the area during the filming months, but Joe Johnston claimed, &quot;Ultimately, the movie looks great because of it. It gave the film a much more interesting and varied look.&quot; For the underground scenes, the crews also recreated a mine, with Johnston expressing that the mine took on a &quot;villainous&quot; appearance in the film, which felt ironic given its position as the town’s source of livelihood. More than 2,000 extras were used in the film. A small switching yard allowed the filmmakers and actors to film the scenes with the boys on the railroad and gave the freedom to do as they pleased, including the tearing apart of tracks. The locomotive used in the scene was Southern Railway 4501, re-lettered as Norfolk and Western No. 4501. Filming concluded on April 30, 1998.

The film&#x27;s star, Jake Gyllenhaal, was 17 years old during filming, the same age as Homer Hickam&#x27;s character. In an interview in 2014, Natalie Canerday recalled that Gyllenhaal was tutored on set because he was still in school and taking advanced classes.

==Release==
&quot;October Sky&quot; opened on February 19, 1999, in 1,495 theaters and had an opening weekend gross of $5,905,250. At its widest theater release, 1,702 theaters were showing the film. It had a total lifetime gross of $34,675,800 worldwide.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;October Sky&quot; received generally positive reviews. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 91% out of 74 critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.6/10. The critic&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Rich in sweet sincerity, intelligence, and good old-fashioned inspirational drama, &quot;October Sky&quot; is a coming-of-age story with a heart to match its Hollywood craftsmanship.&quot; Metacritic gave the film a score of 71 out of 100 based on reviews from 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;A&quot; on scale of A to F.

Many critics commended the film for its focus on family values and inspirational aspects, particularly the main character&#x27;s relationship with his father and the actors&#x27; performances. Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, recognized that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t simplify the father into a bad guy or a tyrant. He understandably wants his son to follow in his footsteps, and one of the best elements of the movie is in breaking free, he is respecting his father. This movie has deep values.&quot;

James Wall of &quot;The Christian Century&quot; described the film&#x27;s concentration on the father-son relationship as &quot;at times painful to watch. There are no winners or losers when sons go their separate ways. &quot;October Sky&quot; does not illustrate good parenting; rather, it evokes the realization that since parents have only a limited vision of how to shape their children&#x27;s future, the job requires a huge amount of love and a lot of divine assistance.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot; claimed that the film&#x27;s highlight was the acting of Gyllenhaal and Cooper.

&quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; pointed out that some viewers may question &quot;the movie&#x27;s hero-worshiping treatment of Homer&#x27;s role model, Wernher von Braun, who&#x27;s depicted as an all-American icon with no acknowledgment of his earlier career in Nazi Germany.&quot; During World War II, Braun was a member of the Nazi party and the Allgemeine SS. In addition, the ballistic weapons that he developed for the Nazi regime were largely constructed by concentration camp prisoners who faced inhumane conditions, with many dying due to their brutal imprisonment.

===Accolades===
&quot;October Sky&quot; won three awards, including: the OCIC Award for Joe Johnston at the Ajijic International Film Festival 1999, the Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards for Best Family Film in 2000, and the Humanitas Prize 1999 for Featured Film Category.

==Differences between the film and book==
The movie was praised for its portrayal of 1950s Appalachia despite several major and minor differences from the book on which it is based.
* Homer Hickam is the main character&#x27;s name; in the book and in real life he was nicknamed &quot;Sonny&quot;.
* Homer Hickam Jr.&#x27;s father was not named John. This was changed in an effort to keep the audience from being confused.
* There were actually six &quot;rocket boys&quot; rather than the four in the movie. Some of the movie&#x27;s representations of the characters are combinations of real-life boys. Their names were: Homer Hickam Jr., Quentin Wilson, Jimmy O&#x27;Dell Carroll, Roy Lee Cooke, Billy Rose, and Sherman Siers.
* The Rocket Boys did not steal railroad parts as in the film; however, they did attempt to grab a cast iron pipe under the tracks and, according to Homer&#x27;s website, this almost got him killed.
* While the boys were accused of starting a fire, they were never detained. The police soon realized that their rockets could not have traveled over 3 miles and the boys were exonerated. Homer never had to prove their innocence, as his character did in the film.
* Homer never dropped out of school to work in the town&#x27;s mine. He did, however, work in the mine the following summer, as described in Hickam&#x27;s book &quot;Sky of Stone.&quot;
* Homer never met Wernher von Braun - as it turns out, von Braun was looking for the Rocket Boys&#x27; exhibit when Homer was looking for him; and they missed each other.

==Cultural impact==
There are two annual festivals in honor of the Rocket Boys and the film. One is held in West Virginia where the real-life events depicted in the book and film took place, and the other is in Tennessee where the movie was actually shot. The Rocket Boys often visit the festival in West Virginia, which is also called the &quot;Rocket Boys Festival&quot;, while the festival in Tennessee focuses more on the filming locations. The Tennessee festival&#x27;s site claims that the festival is &quot;a celebration of our heritage.&quot;

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, saw a screening of &quot;October Sky&quot; in 1999. In a subsequent conversation with the science fiction writer Neal Stephenson, Bezos commented that he had always wanted to start a space company. Stephenson urged him to do so. Bezos then started the private aerospace manufacturing and services company Blue Origin, and Stephenson became one of the company&#x27;s early employees.

The author of &quot;Rocket Boys&quot; claimed that the &quot;Star Trek Enterprise&quot; episode &quot;Carbon Creek&quot; was based on &quot;October Sky&quot;, and there are obvious references to the story in the episode.

<doc id="1110048" wikidata="Q2628345" url="?curid=1110048" title="Shining in the Darkness">
<text>Shining in the Darkness is a 1991 role-playing video game for the Mega Drive/Genesis video game console. It was the first in the &quot;Shining&quot; series.

In 2007, the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console. The game also appears in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, as well as &quot;Sega Mega Drive and Genesis Classics&quot; on PC.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot; is a &quot;dungeon-crawler&quot; role-playing video game. The game puts the player in control of the main character and two friends (Pyra and Milo), as they explore 3D dungeon mazes with turn-based battles.

The game consists of story line interaction, dungeon exploration, random monster fights, and predetermined &#x27;boss&#x27; fights. The combat in this game operates similarly to role-playing video games of the era such as &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; (or, more specifically, &quot;Wizardry&quot;). Additionally, the dungeon contains three characters in need of rescue. Rescuing any or all of the three is optional, and the story changes depending on whether or not the player locates and returns each of these characters to safety. Another key innovation is its icon-based menu system. This is used for battles in dungeons, equipment management, and character interactions in town.

==Plot==
&quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot; is set in the Kingdom of Thornwood. The king&#x27;s daughter and the main character&#x27;s father have vanished, while the evil sorcerer Dark Sol (not to be confused with his father, &quot;Shining Force&quot; villain Darksol) has appeared to threaten the kingdom. The main character is charged to find the Arms of Light, rescue the princess and his own father, and stop Dark Sol.

In &quot;Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict&quot;, it was revealed Dark Sol is the son of Darksol and Mishaela, the villains of &quot;Shining Force: The Legacy of Great Intention&quot;. After the final defeat of Darksol, the child Dark Sol was whisked away by Oddeye, the foremost Greater Devil of Darksol&#x27;s archenemy, Zeon. Therefore, Dark Sol&#x27;s role in &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot; places its entry in the timeline sometime following the events of &quot;Shining Force II&quot;. This revelation also supported by a possible reference to Darksol, when Theos mentions &quot;a Dark Wizard&quot; who once wielded the same Dragonbreath spell as Dark Sol.

==Development==
Sega allocated the bare minimum budget offered to out-of-house developers for the creation of &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot;. In a 2009 interview, Hiroyuki Takahashi (credited for &quot;writing&quot; and producing the game) recalled: 

The game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in North America on August 13, 2007, and in Europe on September 7, 2007.

==Reception==


&quot;Sega Pro&quot; reviewed the game in 1991 and gave it a 93% score, describing the dungeon crawler as &quot;superior to all other RPGs of this style&quot;, praising its detailed &quot;background preparation&quot;, detailed graphics (including scaling sprites and water effects), character conversations, sound design (especially around taverns), replayability (&quot;Every game is different&quot;), and its innovative icon-based menu system. Peter Olafson of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; compared &quot;Shining&quot; to &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; and &quot;Speed Racer&quot;, and favorably cited the combat and animation. The magazine concluded that the game was a &quot;hack-and-slash adventure&quot; that is &quot;not the full-blown CRPG that many gamers were hoping for&quot; but &quot;a &quot;decided&quot; step&quot; in that direction. &quot;Dragon&quot; reviewers praised the game&#x27;s smooth interface and gave it 4 out of 5 stars, saying that it &quot;combines the icons and combat of &quot;Phantasy Star III&quot;, the first person perspective of &quot;Phantasy Star I&quot;, and the great close-up graphics of &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #28 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked the game 32nd on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time.&quot;

By late 1991, over 300,000 copies of the game had sold and paved the way for the new game project Shining Force. 

==Legacy==
&quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot; is considered by many gaming historians to be a pioneer of Japanese console RPGs, especially in Europe, which would not see a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; game until more than six years after &quot;the Darkness&quot; made its mark in the region. One of the game&#x27;s key innovations was its introduction of an icon-based menu system, possibly inspired by fellow Sega RPG &quot;Phantasy Star III: Generations of Doom&quot; (1990). The game also marked the beginning of the successful &quot;Shining&quot; series.

The second game in the &quot;Shining&quot; series, &quot;Shining Force&quot;, diverged greatly in gameplay; however, many stylistic parts are reminiscent of &quot;Shining in the Darkness&quot;, including music and art. Other features such as the distinctive menu system, the use of priests for saving games and resurrecting characters, and several magic spells that would continue to be used in every game in the series up to and including &quot;Shining Force III&quot;, with the notable exception of &quot;Shining Wisdom&quot;. These games also all share story continuity, even &quot;Wisdom&quot;.

A &quot;Shining&quot; game with similar gameplay, &quot;Shining the Holy Ark&quot;, was released for the Sega Saturn in 1996.

<text>Gary Anthony Kowalski (born August 9, 1952) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Manitoba legislature from 1993 to 1999, sitting for most of that time as a Liberal.

The son of Tony Kowalski and Olga Kolczycki, he was born in Winnipeg and worked as a police officer in the &quot;Winnipeg Police Department&quot; before entering public life, serving from 1974 to 1993. He received a &quot;Canada 125th Medal&quot; in 1992, and was elected as a trustee on the &quot;Seven Oaks School Division&quot; in September of the same year.

In 1976, he married Ellen Joy Michie.

When Gulzar Cheema resigned as an MLA in 1993, Kowalski sought and won the Liberal nomination in the Winnipeg riding of The Maples to succeed him. He won the resulting by-election on September 21, defeating New Democrat Norma Walker by about 1500 votes.

The Liberals were reduced to only three seats in the provincial election of 1995, although Kowalski was able to retain The Maples by a significant margin.

The provincial Liberals went through a period of internal division in 1997. Kowalski disapproved of the leadership of Ginny Hasselfield, and left the party to sit as an &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; on June 5, 1997. He was joined by former leadership candidate Kevin Lamoureux shortly thereafter, leaving Neil Gaudry as the only official Liberal MLA in the province. Kowalski initially considered joining the NDP caucus, but declined. Both Kowalski and Lamoureux were re-integrated into the party&#x27;s caucus following Hasselfield&#x27;s resignation in 1998.

Despite (or perhaps because of) his background as a police officer, Kowalski was a vocal supporter of gun control during his time in the legislature. In 1995, Kowalski supported mandatory supervision of sex offenders who had served their sentences, before such individuals were released to the community.

Early in 1999, Kowalski refused to give unanimous consent for the legislature to discuss a motion addressing the farming crisis in southwestern Manitoba. He claimed he was acting on orders from Jon Gerrard (who had replaced Hasselfield as leader), and did not appear to be comfortable with his actions. Kowalski did not seek re-election in 1999, and has not participated in public life since that time. He stated that he intended to return to active duty with the City of Winnipeg Police Services. Kowalski retired from the Winnipeg police force in March 2004 with 31 years of service and subsequently joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

<doc id="1110058" wikidata="Q297099" url="?curid=1110058" title="Kh-22">
<text>The Kh-22 &quot;Storm&quot; (, NATO reporting name AS-4 &#x27;Kitchen&#x27;) is a large, long-range anti-ship cruise missile developed by MKB Raduga in the Soviet Union. It was designed for use against aircraft carriers and carrier battle groups, with either a conventional or nuclear warhead. Kh-32 is an updated conventional variant of the Kh-22 and was accepted to service in 2016; it features an improved rocket motor and a new seeker head.

==Development==
After analyzing World War II naval battles and encounters in the late 1940s and early 1950s, Soviet military thinkers concluded that the era of large seaborne battles was over, and that stand-off attacks would be the way to neutralize and incapacitate large battle groups without having to field a similar force against them. Substituting cruise missiles for air attacks, Soviet Air Forces and Soviet Naval Aviation commanders set about converting their heavy bombers to &quot;raketonosets&quot;, or missile carriers, which could be launched against approaching enemy fleets from coastal or island airfields. The Kh-22 weapon was developed by the Raduga design bureau and used to arm the Tupolev Tu-22.

==Design==
The Kh-22 uses a Tumansky liquid-fuel rocket engine, fueled with TG-02 (Tonka-250) and IRFNA (inhibited red fuming nitric acid), giving it a maximum speed of Mach 4.6 and a range of up to . It can be launched in either high-altitude or low-altitude mode. In high-altitude mode, it climbs to an altitude of and makes a high-speed dive into the target, with a terminal speed of about Mach 4.6. In low-altitude mode, it climbs to and makes a shallow dive at about Mach 3.5. The missile is guided by a gyroscope-stabilized autopilot in conjunction with a radio altimeter.

Soviet tests revealed that when a shaped charge warhead weighing was used in the missile, the resulting hole measured in diameter, in area, and was deep.

By August 2016, Russia was finalizing the trials of the Kh-32 cruise missile, a derivative of the Kh-22. Designed for use by the Tu-22M3 bomber, the missile is designed to climb to to the stratosphere after launch, transition to level flight, then perform a steep dive to the target. The cruise missile version is also designed to target enemy ships, as well as radars, and &quot;radio-contrast targets&quot; like bridges, military bases, electric power plants, and others. The Kh-32 has an inertial navigation system and radar homing head, making it independent of GPS/GLONASS navigation satellites. Presumably, it has a range of and a speed of at least . Apparently the missile entered service in the same year. Thirty-two Kh-22 missiles will be modernized to the Kh-32 level in 2018–2020.

==Operational history==

The first Kh-22PG missile was fired in 1963. The Kh-22 entered service in 1968, along with its missile carrier, the Tu-22K.

=== Soviet era ===
The missiles were used by Soviet and then Russian Air Forces on the Тu-22K (&#x27;Blinder-B&#x27;) and Tu-95K22 (&#x27;Bear-G&#x27;) strategic bombers in patrol mission. Later, the main launch platform is currently the Tupolev Tu-22M3 (&#x27;Backfire&#x27;) long-range strategic bomber.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===
The first combat use of the missile was reported during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 11 May 2022, a video emerged on internet showing a Russian Air Force Tu-22M3 strategic bomber launching a pair of Kh-22 or Kh-32 missiles at targets somewhere in Ukraine.

The UK Ministry of Defence stated that Russia is possibly using anti-ship missiles, like the Kh-22, against ground targets and claimed that such missiles &quot;are highly inaccurate and therefore can cause severe collateral damage and casualties&quot;.

On 9 May 2022, 13 Kh-22 missiles were reportedly fired by the Russian Air Force: seven at Fontanka, a coastal village about north of Odesa, where at least one smashed into the Riviera shopping mall around 10:35 PM (after curfew), killing one, and six at targets in the Donetsk Oblast.

Between 12 May and 25 June 2022, at least 10 other Russian Kh-22 strikes in Ukraine, involving at least 44 missiles in total, were reported in the media.

On 27 June 2022, two Kh-22 or Kh-32 missiles, launched by Russian Tupolev Tu-22M3 bombers, were reportedly used in the Kremenchuk shopping mall attack, killing at least 21 people and injuring at least 59. One missile smashed directly into the mall while the other fell about 450 meters away, into the edge of the Kredmash Road Machinery Plant, which primarily manufactures asphalt and concrete mixers, where it injured two of the 100 employees present. Both missiles might have been aimed at the same target since such distance is within the limited accuracy of Kh-22 missiles.

In the night between 30 June and 1 July 2022, three Kh-22 missiles were fired from Tu-22M3s into a 9-storey apartment building and a recreational center in Serhiivka, Ukraine, killing at least 21 people and wounding at least 39.

On 14 September 2022, it was reported at least seven Kh-22 missiles were launched by Russia at various hydraulic structures in Kryvyi Rih, including a nearby dam. This caused the water level of the Inhulets river to increase by , or even . Previously, the Inhulets was too shallow, allowing the Ukrainian army to build pontoon bridges during its southern counteroffensive. However, Ukrainian MoD claimed that Kh-101 missiles were used in the strike.

On 14 January 2023, a Russian missile strike, possibly using a Kh-22, demolished a 9-storey apartment building in Dnipro and started a large fire. At least 44 civilians were killed and 73 were wounded in the attack.

On 8 May 2023, Ukrainian Air Force spokesman Colonel Yurii Ihnat said that &quot;seven aircraft and up to eight launches of Kh-22 cruise missiles&quot; at Odesa Oblast. Many of the missiles are believed to have self-destructed due to their age. Only one is believed to have hit a food storage warehouse in Odesa. The missiles were fired from Tu-22 bombers.

Three nights of attacks on Odesa, 17–20 July, had been successful due to the then less advanced systems protecting the city compared to those in Kyiv. Out of nineteen cruise missiles fired, Ukraine only intercepted five on 20 July. The Kh-22 missiles cannot be shot down due to their speed. Yurii Ihnat, spokesman for the Ukrainian Air Force, said that “What could be shot down is being shot down,” They required either Patriot missiles or SAMP-T to protect the region from missiles like Kh-22.

During the 29 December 2023 Russian strikes on Ukraine and other attacks, eight X-22/Kh-22s have been fired at Ukraine by Russian forces. None have been shot down by Ukrainian forces. Although it is suggested that Russia has been targeting areas where there are no Patriot missile batteries, of which Ukraine has three, or one SAMP/T.

On 19 April 2024, Ukraine claimed to have shot down two Kh-22/32s for the first time during the war. Pictures were later released showing the Kh-32 was manufactured in 2023.

On 20 August 2024, at the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi for the first time announced data on how many weapons Russia has used since 2022, as well as how many were intercepted. The report said that only 2/362 (0.55%) of Kh-22/32s were intercepted by Ukraine’s air defense

==Variants==
Two initial versions were built, the Kh-22 with a large conventional warhead and the Kh-22N with a 350–1000-kiloton nuclear warhead. In the mid-1970s, this was supplemented by the Kh-22P, an anti-radiation missile for the destruction of radar installations. In the 1970s, the Kh-22 was upgraded to Kh-22M and Kh-22MA standard, with new attack profiles, somewhat longer range, and a datalink allowing mid-course updates.
* Kh-22M/MA — upgraded variants with Mach 3.3 speed and range. Weighs , contains of RDX.
* Kh-32 — an updated conventional variant of Kh-22 with Mach 5 speed and range. It features an improved rocket motor and a new seeker head. Currently produced for the Tu-22M3 launch platform. Warhead weight has been reduced to to improve range.

<text>The Thailand national football team (, , ) represents Thailand in senior international football and is controlled by the Football Association of Thailand.

In the regional competition, Thailand is the most successful football team in Southeast Asia with seven ASEAN Championship trophies and nine senior-level gold medals from the Southeast Asian Games, the most of any Southeast Asian country. In higher levels, Thailand achieved the third place in the 1972 AFC Asian Cup where it was the host, and has a total of seven appearances in the AFC Asian Cup so far. Furthermore, the team reached the fourth-place in the 1990 and 1998 Asian Games and participated in the Summer Olympics twice. However, Thailand has failed to obtain higher achievements in the continental and global records. The team obtained their first win in the AFC Asian Cup in 2007 and had to wait 47 years to finally sneak out of the group stage in 2019. Thailand also advanced to the final round of World Cup qualification twice, in 2002 and 2018, but failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.

==History==
===1915–1995: dynastic establishment===
The team&#x27;s predecessor, which operated under the name of &quot;Siam&quot;, was founded in 1915 and played its first unofficial match against a team of Europeans at the Royal Bangkok Sports Club Stadium on 20 December that year. The team played its first international match in 1930 against the Indochina national team, which included both South Vietnamese and French players.
Thailand appeared in the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, where their lost to Great Britain 0–9, was the largest to that point, thus failing to advance to the quarter-finals. In 1959, Thailand as the host won silver medals in the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games after losing 1–3 to South Vietnam in the final. In 1965, Thailand harbored its first distinct title: the very first place in the Southeast Asian Games. They made their second and latest appearance at the Summer Olympics in 1968, losing all three matches by at least 3 goals margin to Bulgaria, Guatemala, and Czechoslovakia hence en route to a first-round exit.

During the 1992 AFC Asian Cup qualification, Thailand gained a significant success defeating South Korea 2–1 and Bangladesh 1–0 to top the group and qualify to the 1992 AFC Asian Cup. The team&#x27;s performance at the final tournament was drawing first two matches with Qatar and eventual 3rd place China then losing 0–4 to Saudi Arabia. In 1994, manager Thawatchai Sartjakul assembled a team that has been denounced as the &quot;dream team&quot; with players like Kiatisuk Senamuang, Tawan Sripan and Dusit Chalermsan.

===1996–2016: flag bearer of Southeast Asia===
In 1996, Thailand defeated Malaysia 1–0 and win the 1996 AFF Championship for the first time. Thailand were favorites to regain the crown in 2007, 2008 and 2012 only to lose tight finals to Singapore and Vietnam respectively.

The regional 1998 AFF Championship saw Thailand met Indonesia in a match that ill-hearted players from both team deliberately making actions aimed to avoid facing hosts Vietnam in the semi-finals and undergoing technical burden of moving training bases from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi. FIFA fined both teams $40,000 for &quot;violating the spirit of the game&quot;. Thailand eventually lost the match, inevitably encountered and failed to Vietnam in the semi-finals.

Thailand consecutively qualified to and participated in two AFC Asian Cup final tournaments both held within Western Asia in 1996 and 2000 when their &quot;dream team&quot; was beginning its golden period. Coincidentally in both editions, the team&#x27;s opponents all came from Western Asia and they are Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq, with the latter two share the same group with Thailand twice. In both editions, Thailand made two draws and lost the rest, bottomed the group stage of the first and is the worst third-placed team of the second edition.

The final 2000 AFF Championship match between Thailand and Indonesia, at a sold-out Rajamangala, was almost a carbon copy of their group stage encounter. The War Elephants triumphed 4–1 again with Worrawoot setting up camp at the opponents&#x27; goal. The 28-year-old scored twice in their first match and in the final struck a hat-trick in the first 32 minutes. In the final 2002 AFF Cup final, Thailand again met Indonesia (who was now the host) and won the game in penalty shootout despite taking a 2–0 lead.

Thailand again qualified to the 2004 AFC Asian Cup and was put into a group with Japan, Iran and debutant Oman. Despite vast experiences in the Asian Cup, the team has yet to show a sign of improvement as they lost all matches and became the worst-performed team in the whole tournament.

The sign of improvement only came in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup when Thailand participated as a well-prepared co-host and was placed with the debutant Australia, Oman, and Iraq. The team managed a draw to Iraq and a historic win over Oman. With 4 points ahead, Thailand&#x27;s chance to qualify for the next round for the first time since 1972 was all but shattered by the likes of Australia in a 0–4 demolition. The tournament witnessed the end of Thailand&#x27;s recognizable generation with later retirements of Kiatisuk, Tawan, and Pipat.

In September 2008, Thailand signed a four-year contract with the English coach Peter Reid but Reid left his position by mutual consent after only a year in charge as his team fail to clinch the championship of 2008 AFF Championship after 2–3 on aggregate lost to Vietnam in the finals.

In September 2009, Bryan Robson agreed to coach Thailand in his first foray into international football management and was contracted to manage the team through to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In November, Robson celebrated his first competitive match in charge of the team with an away victory against Singapore in a 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualifying group match but then lose to the same opponent back home. Then, two goalless draws with Jordan and Iran in January 2010 and an 0–1 away lost to Iran in March all effectively ended the chance of qualifying for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. In preparations for the 2010 AFF Championship, Robson led Thailand to victorious run against Singapore and Bob Houghton&#x27;s India in a series of friendlies. However, when entering the tournament in December, he failed to bring Thailand past group A after managing only draws against Laos and Malaysia and losing to Indonesia. Robson resigned as Thailand&#x27;s manager on 8 June 2011, citing health problems as the reason and was replaced by Winfried Schäfer, who would be the ninth German person to coach the Thailand team.

The new coach called up starlets for the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and have the starting set of matches losing minimal to Australia, defeating Oman 3–0 and drawing Saudi Arabia but did not make it after losing to these teams altogether in the second set. In the 2012 AFF Championship, Thailand topped their group and surpassed Malaysia in the semi-finals but handed the crown to Singapore in the finals. In the 2015 Asian Cup qualification, Thailand showed a setback with its defensive frailties exposed by Middle Eastern rivals (Iran, Kuwait, Lebanon) when losing all 6 games in the qualifiers, conceding 21 goals in the process.

In June 2013, Schäfer canceled his contract. The FA of Thailand appointed the former player Kiatisuk Senamuang as the new caretaker coach for the national team. His first ride was a friendly against China PR on 15 June, which Thailand surprisingly won 5–1.

In 2014, Thailand ended a 12-year drought of the AFF Championship title from the late goals by Charyl Chappuis and Chanathip Songkrasin which gave them a dramatic 4–3 aggregate victory over Malaysia in the second leg of the finals at Bukit Jalil. The team did not lose any match up until the second leg of the finals and often featured a tiki-taka playing style, for instance including 27 consecutive passes during the first leg of the finals against Malaysia. Kiatisuk consequently became the first person to win the ASEAN Football Championship as both a player and a coach. Thailand succeeded in protecting AFF Championship reign two years later in 2016, defeating Indonesia 3–2 aggregately despite losing the first leg.

In 2015, evasion fuelled hope for both the players and Thailand fans of finally reaching the World Cup tournament and tension is mounting as the national team commenced AFC&#x27;s second round for 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification. Teerasil Dangda, Thailand&#x27;s renowned striker, rejoined the rank of the national team after his loan with UD Almería ended earlier. Drawn in Group F along with Chinese Taipei, Iraq and Vietnam, who Thailand played its first match home against on 24 May and can only be won by a victory goal from a shot 20 yards away. They played a much easier match at the same opponent&#x27;s home soil, winning 3–0. Thailand won both matches against Chinese Taipei and drew 2–2 both matches against Iraq, allowing them to qualify for the next round as group F winners.
In the last round, Kiatisuk&#x27;s men shared the same group with Australia, Japan, Saudi Arabia, UAE along with previous opponent, Iraq. Again, Thailand was eliminated without winning a match and recorded only two points out of ten matches.

===2017–present: Rebuilding to achieve the continental success===

==== Rajevac, Sirisak and Nishino ====
Since taking over the administration by Somyot Poompanmoung, FA Thailand aims to drive men&#x27;s national football team to be one of the leading teams in Asia by which there are concrete 20 years development plans and preparations. After the elimination from World Cup qualifiers, Kiatisuk resigned and Thailand appointed Milovan Rajevac as a coach, thus marked the first non-Brazilian/German/English team&#x27;s chief. With the new coach, however, Thailand failed to defend its AFF Championship title in 2018 when losing Malaysia in the semi-finals by the away goals rule.

Ahead of 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Thailand was drawn into group A together with the host UAE, Bahrain and India. Rajevac oversaw Thailand in the commencing 1–4 loss to India. The Serbian coach was sacked and his assistant, Sirisak Yodyardthai became the interim coach on 7 January. Sirisak guided Thailand to a 1–0 win over Bahrain and a 1–1 draw with the host UAE, enough to move on to the knockout stage of the AFC Asian Cup for the first time in 47 years. Their success was greeted with congratulation from the FA. Thailand encountered China in the round of sixteen, taking an early lead but eventually lost 2–1 as China make their decisive respond.

After finishing in the fourth place of 2019 King&#x27;s Cup and losing the rival Vietnam in that tournament, Sirisak had resigned and FA Thailand appointed the Japanese coach Akira Nishino, who had brought Japan to the round of 16 of 2018 FIFA World Cup, for replacement. This was the first-ever Asian coach becoming Thailand&#x27;s head coach. The team was drawn into group G of the second round of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification with other three Southeast Asian rivals: Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia; along with United Arab Emirates. Despite defeating Indonesia 3–0 and UAE 2–1, Thailand failed to revenge Vietnam when getting goalless draws in both legs, while losing Malaysia 1–2 in Bukit Jalil. With these results, Thailand could only get the third place in group G after five qualifying matches. After a one-year disruption due to COVID-19 pandemic, Thailand and other teams in group G had to play their remaining matches in Dubai, UAE. However, the team suffered a huge loss of key players when Chanathip Songkrasin was injured, while Teerasil Dangda and Theerathon Bunmathan refused to participate the qualification due to various reasons. Without these three players, Thailand showed a poor performance in Dubai - drawn the bottom place team Indonesia 2–2, then lost the UAE 1–3 and Malaysia 0–1, respectively; which eventually pushed the team down to the fourth place of the group G. Nishino did not come back to Thailand to explain the team&#x27;s failure, but unilaterally returning to Japan, which made FA Thailand appoint Anurak Srikerd as the caretaker and consider sacking Nishino in upcoming days. On 29 July 2021, shortly after Nishino came back to Thailand, FA Thailand decided to terminate the contract with Nishino.

==== Fruitful victories under Alexandré Pölking ====

On 28 September 2021, Brazilian Alexandré Pölking was appointed as the head coach of the Thailand national team, replacing Akira Nishino. Pölking&#x27;s first task was the 2020 AFF Championship in December 2021 held in Singapore. Between 5 December 2021 and 1 January 2022, Polking accomplished the very task as he managed the War Elephants to win 6–2 on aggregate after being held to a 2–2 second-leg draw by Indonesia, guiding Thailand to win the AFF Championship for the sixth time. In the 2022 AFF Championship, Thailand defended their title on 16 January 2023, winning the tournament by a 3–2 aggregate score in the two-legged final against Vietnam to secure their seventh title.

In October 2023, Thailand embarked on a European tour playing two friendlies against Georgia and Estonia and with star players like Chanathip Songkrasin, Nicholas Mickelson and Ekanit Panya injured and club team refused to release Teerasil Dangda and Theerathon Bunmathan, Supachok Sarachat, Sarach Yooyen, Pansa Hemviboon for international duties, Thailand have to relies on inexperienced international players and also giving the opportunity for new young players a chance to touched up for the future international matches. On 12 October 2023, Thailand suffered their worst defeat in the 21st century losing against Georgia 8–0 at the Mikheil Meskhi Stadium. In the next match against Estonia on 17 October, Jakkapan Praisuwan equalised it for Thailand for a hard fought 1–1 draw at the Lilleküla Stadium.

==== 2023 AFC Asian Cup ====

After a hurried attempt, Japanese manager Masatada Ishii was announced as Thailand&#x27;s temporarily new head coach, with a contract lasted until the end of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup as he faced a daunting prospect of reviving the lacklustre Thai side to reach continental level. His first match, a friendly against his homeland Japan, saw Thailand thrashed 5–0 in the second half after an impressive first half display, increased negative feelings among Thai fans as the War Elephants faced a huge challenge in group F at the Asian Cup, with Saudi Arabia, Kyrgyzstan and Oman on the same boat.

Amidst drop of a huge pessimism, Thailand started their Asian Cup campaign against Kyrgyzstan to a bright note, winning 2–0 to mark Thailand&#x27;s first win in an Asian Cup opening match. After a 2–0 victory over Kyrgyzstan, Thailand squared up against a far stronger Oman side, which was boosted by bright performances over the past three years and under the Croatian manager Branko Ivanković, an Asian football expert who never lost to Thailand in his coaching career. However, Thailand defied all expectation of an easy Omani triumph, resolutely defended throughout the match and several times created opportunities to end the game with a famous goalless shutout, giving Thailand four points and the country&#x27;s early progression to the knockout stage. Thailand would then go on to produce its most famous game in their modern Asian Cup history, a brilliant counter-offensive tactic against Asian hegemon Saudi Arabia in the final group stage match, including a famous penalty save by Saranon Anuin as Thailand made a famous goalless draw to the Saudis, ending their losing streak that started in 2012 to the same opponent and, for the first time ever, Thailand gained a shutout record in the Asian Cup group stage. However, Thailand failed to end their miserable knockout stage record in the Asian Cup, losing 2–1 to Uzbekistan in the round of 16 to equal their 2019 result. Despite this exit, Thailand&#x27;s bright performance in the tournament earned the team significant praises for their resoluteness and ability to adapt to difficult circumstances, and Masatada Ishii was appointed on a permanent basis, with the aim to help Thailand to qualify for the third round of the 2026 World Cup qualification and the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.

====2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying====
The 2026 FIFA World Cup qualification saw Thailand drawn in group C against South Korea, China and Singapore, with the target to be winning the second place to advance to the final round. However, Thailand would get off to a disastrous start, flopping at home to China 2–1 despite opened the scoring by Sarach Yooyen. This home loss ultimately sealed Pölking&#x27;s fate, despite a 3–1 away victory over Singapore which moved Thailand up to second place; with the Brazilian sacked for failing to meet expectations.

After the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Thailand played two more qualifiers, both against South Korea, in March 2024. On 21 March 2024, Thailand managed to earn a surprise 1–1 draw in front of 64,912 fans in Seoul, but would later lose 3–0 at home to the same opponents. Thailand would end their qualification campaign in June undefeated, notably with a 1–1 draw away to China, before managing to overcome Singapore 3–1; yet their inability to convert scoring opportunities, as well as giving up a late goal in their draw with China, sealed Thailand&#x27;s fate. The team did not advance to the next phase and finished behind China based on head-to-head results, as both teams ended with the same goal difference and points total.

== Team image ==

=== Colours ===
In older days, the primary kits worn are all red.

Thailand national team used to play with a kit made by local provider FBT. This contract lasted until June 2007.

In July 2007, Nike became kit providers, and from October that year, the team played in an all-yellow home kit in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej&#x27;s 80th birthday (yellow being the royal color), having used two other yellow kits in friendlies against China on 16 May 2007 and Qatar on 2 July 2007.

From October 2012 through 2016, Nike was replaced by Grand Sport in a deal worth 96M baht (3.1M USD). The new home kit of Thailand reverted to all-red and the away kit to all-blue. However, the order was reversed from the 2014 AFF Championship onward.

In September 2016, the national team signed a four-year contract with Warrix Sports to be their kit provider from 2017. On 4 January 2017, the new provider introduced a new pair of Thailand kits that was all black home and all white away, honouring their late King Bhumibol for a year after his passing, with black and white being the traditional Thai colors of mourning.

In March 2018, Warrix returned Thailand to the all-blue first, all-red second kits with an addition of a white-black third kit.

In December 2018, a new, darker version of blue, red kits and an all white third kit were presented for the 2019 AFC Asian Cup campaign and the rest of 2019. For the 2019 King&#x27;s Cup in May, Warrix released the kit consisting of a yellow shirt with white shorts and socks – yellow reportedly being the favorite color of the newly crowned King Maha Vajiralongkorn.

===Rivalries===
====Notable rivalries====
Thailand has rivalries with Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. These rivalries are rooted in geographical proximity.
Thailand&#x27;s greatest rival is Malaysia, the two teams having played each other 107 times. Before Malaysia fell into football scandal that weakened the country&#x27;s football development from the 1990s to 2018, Malaysia was Thailand&#x27;s most annoying and difficult opponent in the region. Despite the football scandal, Thailand have not defeated the Malaysians on their home turf since 1971. Thailand have better records in international football competitions than the Malaysians.

Indonesia has met Thailand in three finals of the AFF Championship at 2000, 2002 and 2016, and Thailand all triumphed at the expense of Indonesia. It&#x27;s been said that while Thailand was able to elevate its position to become a more serious Asian competitor, Indonesia fell into mismanagement and matches between two teams also began to lose its importance.

The rivalry between Thailand and Singapore is a newer one and its importance can be emphasized by the domination of both countries in the AFF Championship with Thailand winning five times and Singapore winning four. Up until 2012, Singapore and Thailand have been the more dominant forces in Southeast Asian football. Football development in both countries have been different with Thailand relies mostly on its own domestically developed players while Singapore has been reliant on naturalized players.

Thailand&#x27;s rivalry with Vietnam has developed differently from times. During the time of South Vietnam and North Vietnam, Thailand had a poorer performance with the team only won 5 matches against the South Vietnamese. However, when Vietnam rejoined international football at 1991, Thailand has been more dominant than their eastern rival.

When Myanmar was still a football power, it was Thailand&#x27;s first-ever rival, owned by the history of the Burmese–Siamese wars which led to a nationalist fervor among Thai fans with its desire to beat the Burmese. But with Myanmar weakened following the reign of Ne Win and junta, Thailand improved and since 1983, holds an undefeated streak over its western rival. The rivalry today only serves mostly in the memoir of Burmese fans who are nostalgic to an era when Myanmar was still a leading football power, while for some Thai fans, they have more important opponents to concentrate on.

===Home ground===
Most of Thailand home matches took place in Rajamangala National Stadium in Bang Kapi District of Bangkok. Built for the 1998 Asian Games, the stadium is the largest sporting facility in Thailand with a capacity of 49,749, all seated. International matches are also occasionally played at Supachalasai Stadium, 700th Anniversary Stadium, 80th Birthday Stadium, Thammasat Stadium, Chang Arena, BG Stadium and Thunderdome Stadium.

<text>Richard Sylvannus Reynolds (20 June 1915 – 2 September 2002) was an Australian rules footballer who played for the Essendon Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Reynolds is one of four footballers to have won three Brownlow Medals, with the others being Haydn Bunton Sr., Bob Skilton and Ian Stewart. Revered by Essendon supporters, he was often referred to simply as &quot;King Richard&quot;.

==Family==
The son of William Meader Reynolds (1886–1940) and Mary James Reynolds, née Thompson (1885–1941), and one of seven children, Richard Sylvannus Reynolds was born on 20 June 1915. He died on 2 September 2002. He was the brother of Tom Reynolds, the cousin of Richmond champion player and coach Max Oppy, and the grandfather of Joel Reynolds.

==Early life and career==

Reynolds grew up supporting and sold lollies outside Princes Park on match days.

When Reynolds won his first Brownlow Medal in 1934, champion Haydn Bunton Sr., whom Reynolds had narrowly beaten to win the award, was the first person to telegraph his congratulations, a sporting gesture that Reynolds deeply appreciated.

Reynolds would normally wear the number three guernsey throughout his playing career with Essendon, but had to wear the number four guernsey during one match of the 1937 VFL season when he left his uniform at home.

In June 1947, it was announced that Reynolds would start writing about football for the now-defunct Melbourne newspaper &quot;The Argus&quot;.

Like many footballers, Reynolds was also a noted cricketer. He was a successful medium-fast bowler for Essendon Cricket Club but gave up the game when it started to interfere with football. In January 1949, he made a return to district cricket when Essendon batsman Ken Meuleman was picked for State duty.

After being re-elected yet again as player-coach by the Essendon committee in February 1949, Reynolds guided the Bombers to the Grand Final against , which they won by 73 points. Reynolds, who was playing his 299th game, described it afterwards as &quot;the best Essendon performance he could remember.&quot;

Off the field, Reynolds was a shy and private man, noted for his humility about his footballing achievements.

== Champions of Essendon ==
In 2002, an Essendon panel ranked him first in their &quot;Champions of Essendon&quot; list of the 25 greatest players ever to have played for Essendon.

Just three days before his death, after being given a standing ovation by the crowd at the announcement dinner, at which he was named the greatest Essendon player of all time, Reynolds was visibly moved and stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t deserve this honour... Bill Hutchison was the best player I ever saw.&quot;

==Death==
Reynolds&#x27; funeral was held at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Melbourne, on 6 September 2002. After the service, the hearse made its way to Windy Hill, where Essendon fans had gathered to farewell their greatest player one last time.

His family&#x27;s link with Essendon continued when his grandson Joel Reynolds was selected by the club in the 2001 AFL Draft. He made his debut in Round 3, 2002, against Brisbane at the Gabba, with Dick watching from the stands.

A statue in his honour was erected in 2004 at the Parade of Champions at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

==Brownlow Medals==
In July 2017, it was announced by Reynolds&#x27; family that his three Brownlow Medals were to be auctioned by Mosgreen.

<text>Spruce beer is a beverage flavored with the buds, needles, or essence of spruce trees. &quot;Spruce beer&quot; can refer to either alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages.

A number of flavors are associated with spruce-flavored beverages, ranging from floral, citrus, and fruity, to cola-like flavors to resinous and piney. This diversity in flavor likely comes from the choice of spruce species, the season in which the spruce ingredients are harvested, and the manner of preparation.

Using evergreen needles to create beverages was practiced in both Northern Europe and North America. Certain Indigenous peoples of North America used the drink as a cure for scurvy during the winter months when fresh fruits were not available, as the fresh shoots of many spruces and pines are a natural source of vitamin C. It may also have been brewed in Scandinavia prior to European contact with the Americas, but most French and British explorers were ignorant of its use as a treatment for scurvy when they arrived in North America. Jacques Cartier and his explorers were exposed to it as a tea when they arrived in Stadacona in what is now Quebec in 1535. European sailors adopted the practice and subsequently spread it across the world.

== History ==
===North America and the Pacific ===
In 1536, the French explorer Jacques Cartier, exploring the St. Lawrence River, used the local natives&#x27; knowledge to save his men who were dying of scurvy. He boiled the needles of a tree the St. Lawrence Iroquoians called the &quot;Aneda&quot; (probably &quot;Thuja occidentalis&quot;, commonly known as &quot;eastern white cedar&quot; and &quot;arborvitae) to make a tea that was later shown to contain 50 mg of vitamin C per 100 grams. Such treatments were not available aboard ship, where the disease was most common. When Samuel de Champlain arrived 72 years later, he could not ask the locals which tree should be used, as the St. Lawrence Iroquoians had disappeared. This method of treating scurvy using evergreen-needle beverages was later picked up by the British Royal Navy, and spruce was regularly added to ship-brewed beer during eighteenth century explorations of the West Coast of North America and the wider Pacific, including New Zealand. Jane Austen, who had two brothers in the Royal Navy, refers to spruce beer in Chapter 40 of &quot;Emma&quot;.

Alcoholic spruce beer was common in the colonial United States and eastern Canada, made from red or black spruce. An American recipe from the 1796 edition of &quot;American Cookery&quot; by Amelia Simmons states:

Take of hops, let them boil half an hour in one gallon [] of water, strain the hop water then add sixteen gallons [] of warm water, two gallons [] of molasses, of essence of spruce, dissolved in one quart [] of water, put it in a clean cask, then shake it well together, add half a pint [] of emptins, then let it stand and work one week, if very warm weather less time will do, when it is drawn off to bottle, add one spoonful of molasses to every bottle.

The Daily Order (11 June 1759) for the Highland Regiment in North America stipulated that: &quot;Spruce beer is to be brewed for the health and conveniency of the troops which will be served at prime cost. Five quarts of molasses will be put into every barrel of Spruce Beer. Each gallon will cost nearly three coppers&quot;.

A Canadian recipe using similar ingredients for an unfermented tea from 1757 states:

It is made of the tops and branches of the spruces-tree, boiled for three hours, then strained into casks, with a certain quantity of molasses; and, as soon as cold, it is fit for use [...]

Today Sitka spruce, native to the northwest coast of North America, tends to be favored, although other species of spruce have also been used. Lighter, more citrus-like flavors are produced by using the bright green fresh spring growth before the new needles and twigs harden and become woody. Sitka spruce trees on the north-central Oregon Coast develop spring growth in early to mid-May.

== Modern types ==

===Spruce as flavoring in barley-based beer===

Spruce or other evergreens have sometimes been used as a flavoring ingredient in beer, such as Alba Scots Pine Ale, the Alaskan Brewing Company&#x27;s Winter Ale, Beau&#x27;s Brewery&#x27;s Spruce Moose Pale Ale, and Yards Brewing Company&#x27;s Poor Richard&#x27;s Tavern Spruce. Banded Brewing in Biddeford, Maine brews a pale ale named Greenwarden every spring with Maine foraged white spruce tips. Portsmouth New Hampshire&#x27;s Earth Eagle Brewings combines locally foraged pine and spruce tips in their seasonal Connie Ferale amber. Tamworth Distilling in Tamworth, New Hampshire distills a spruce gin from foraged spruce tips also.

===Re-creations of historic recipes===
Very few modern beers are actually termed &quot;spruce beer&quot;; those that exist are often express attempts to create a historical recipe, which may be sugar-based or barley-based. One is Wigram Brewing Company&#x27;s &quot;Spruce Beer&quot;, which is based on Captain Cook&#x27;s first beer brewed in New Zealand in 1773; similarly, Yards Brewing Company says its &quot;Poor Richard&#x27;s Tavern Spruce Ale&quot; is based upon a recipe for spruce beer recorded by Benjamin Franklin.

===Spruce-flavored fermented beverages===
Alcoholic spruce beer may also be made from sugar and flavoring from the spruce tree. Leaves, small branches, or extracted essence of spruce are boiled with sugar and fermented with yeast. Two different sources of sugar may be used, either molasses or white refined sugar. A recipe for home-brewing spruce beer of this type appeared in 1974 in &quot;Cape Breton&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.

===Soft drinks===
In the Canadian provinces of Newfoundland and Quebec, where it is known in French as &quot;bière d&#x27;épinette&quot;, spruce beer may refer to either an artificially flavored non-alcoholic carbonated soft drink, or to genuine spruce beer. The latter is now made only by a few microbreweries.

<text>You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim is the third studio album by American singer-songwriter Jim Croce; it released in April 1972 by ABC Records.

==History and release==
The album was recorded over a three to four-week period for approximately $18,000, with most funding coming from the PolyGram Group in Baarn, the Netherlands, on the basis of hearing an eight-song demo tape assembled by production team Cashman &amp; West. The deal with PolyGram was made after team attorney Phil Kurnit approached a contact within the record company who then had PolyGram executives listen to the demo tape.
After having the finished album rejected by up to 40 record labels, Croce was signed to ABC Records after Cashman &amp; West had a chance meeting with ABC promotion man Marty Kupps. Kupps urged label head Jay Lasker to sign Croce after hearing cuts from a cassette tape of the finished album.

The record spent 93 weeks on the charts, longer than any other Jim Croce album. Due to the strong performance of the posthumous single release &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; (#1 pop, No. 1 AC), &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot; was the best selling album in the U.S. for five weeks in early 1974. It was listed at No. 6 on the 1974 &quot;Cash Box&quot; year-end album charts. Two singles were originally released from the album in 1972: the title track (#8 pop) and &quot;Operator (That&#x27;s Not the Way It Feels)&quot; (#17 pop).

The album was issued on CD by the Rhino Flashbacks record label on September 30, 2008.

==Tracks==

The lyrics of the title track concern the fate of a &#x27;pool-shooting son-of-a-gun&#x27; by the name of &#x27;Big&#x27; Jim Walker when his &#x27;mark&#x27;, Willie &#x27;Slim&#x27; McCoy, from South Alabama, shows up to get a refund from being hustled or get revenge. The song is notable for the line, &quot;You don&#x27;t tug on Superman&#x27;s cape/You don&#x27;t spit into the wind/You don&#x27;t pull the mask off that ol&#x27; Lone Ranger/And you don&#x27;t mess around with Jim.&quot; However, after the song ends with Jim being thoroughly thrashed by his victim (&quot;he&#x27;d been cut &#x27;n &#x27;bout a hundred places/ and he&#x27;d been shot in a couple more&quot;), the chorus now goes, &quot;You don&#x27;t mess around with Slim.&quot;

== Reception ==
William Ruhlmann of AllMusic called it &quot;his commercial breakthrough&quot;

&quot;Billboard&quot; selected the album for a &quot;Pop Special Merit&quot; review, and called it &quot;an Fashioned Album&quot;

<text>Joseph Field (1772–1807) was born in 1772 in Culpeper County, Virginia. His younger brother Reubin was born in 1774. They were born and raised in Virginia until they moved at an early age to Kentucky and were considered to be part of the &quot;nine young men from Kentucky&quot; in the Lewis and Clark Expedition which they joined on August 1, 1803. Both men were known as fine woodsmen and hunters. The brothers returned to Kentucky in 1806. Joseph is thought to have died sometime between June 27 and October 20, 1807.

For a brief period, Joseph Field was employed by the Bullitt&#x27;s Lick salt business, and because of this expertise, he was able to support the expedition.

<text>Michael Joseph Carmody is a retired senior Australian public servant. He was the Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia from January 1993 to 31 December 2005 and the chief executive officer of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service until 4 September 2012.

==Life and career==
Carmody attended secondary school at St. Bernard&#x27;s College, Melbourne.

Carmody joined the ATO in Melbourne in 1968, later moving to the ATO&#x27;s National Office in Canberra in 1973. There he was involved in a wide range of taxation issues, including tax avoidance, legislation and tax reform.

In 1983, Carmody relocated to Sydney where he assumed the role of First Assistant Deputy Commissioner. Later in the same year, he assumed the role of Deputy Commissioner in the ATO&#x27;s Parramatta branch.
Returning to National Office in 1986, Carmody was appointed as Second Commissioner in charge of revenue collection and audit, and in the following year, leader of the ATO&#x27;s &quot;modernisation program&quot;.

Carmody holds a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Melbourne, and he attended Harvard University&#x27;s six-week Advanced Management Program in 1989.

Carmody was appointed Commissioner of Taxation in 1993. During his time as Commissioner, he was highly regarded internationally for what was viewed as an innovative approach to tax administration. During his almost 13-year career as Federal Commissioner of Taxation, Carmody oversaw the modernisation of the Australian Taxation Office (&quot;ATO&quot;), the implementation of a number of significant reforms to the Australian taxation system, and the design and implementation of a new compliance management program.

Carmody&#x27;s leadership of the ATO led to its push to encourage taxpayers to deal with the ATO and other Government agencies electronically.

On 10 November 2005 Carmody announced that he would be leaving the office of Federal Commissioner of Taxation to take up a position as chief executive officer of the then Australian Customs Service, replacing Lionel Woodward. He was replaced by Second Commissioner Michael D’Ascenzo from 1 January 2006. Carmody was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2005 for his work in tax administration

Carmody&#x27;s retirement was announced by the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice Jason Clare on 24 August 2012. Clare described Carmody as a 44-year giant of the Commonwealth Public Service and reflected that his intellect, capacity and decency would be sorely missed by all in the Commonwealth Public Sector.

==Awards==
Carmody was made an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2005 for his work in Tax administration.

<text>Charles Harold Reliford (born September 19, 1956) is an American baseball executive in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a Supervisor of Umpires, a role he took in 2009. 

From 1989 to 2009, he was a Major League Baseball umpire, originally in the National League (NL) umpire from 1989 to 1999. He wore uniform number 18. Reliford retired from umpiring following the 2009 season, taking a job as a supervisor of umpires.

Reliford began umpiring in the minor leagues in 1982, eventually reaching the Triple-A American Association. He made his NL debut on May 29, 1989.

Reliford officiated in the World Series in 2000 and 2004, and in the All-Star Game in 1996 and 2007. He has also umpired in three League Championship Series (1999, 2001, 2002) and in four Division Series (1995, 1997, 2000, 2004).

In Game 2 of the 2000 World Series, Reliford was the home plate umpire when Mike Piazza of the New York Mets had his bat shatter and fly towards the pitcher&#x27;s mound on a foul ball. Roger Clemens of the New York Yankees fired the sawed-off piece of the bat toward Piazza, causing both benches to empty and reigniting the controversy that had begun the previous July, when Clemens had hit Piazza in the head with a pitch during an interleague game at Yankee Stadium.

On September 3, 2008, Reliford was the crew chief for the first major league game in history to use instant replay on a boundary home run call. Alex Rodriguez of the New York Yankees had hit a ball near the left field foul pole at Tropicana Field that was ruled a home run by third-base umpire Brian Runge. Although all the umpires agreed with the call, Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon argued the ball was foul and asked for a review; however, by rule, the decision to review was solely Reliford&#x27;s to make as the crew chief. After a conversation with the other umpires, Reliford agreed to the replay and after a brief review upheld the initial home run call.

<doc id="1110095" wikidata="Q5210624" url="?curid=1110095" title="Dale Scott">
<text>Dale Allan Scott (born August 14, 1959) is an American former umpire in Major League Baseball. He worked in the American League from 1986 to 1999, and officiated in both leagues from 2000 until his retirement after the 2017 season. He became a crew chief in 2001. He wore uniform number 39 his first two years and number 5, previously worn in the AL by Russ Goetz, thereafter.

==Umpiring career==
Scott began umpiring at age 15 and entered the minor leagues in 1981, eventually working his way up to the Triple-A American Association. He umpired a single major league game during the 1985 MLB season, making his debut in an August 19 game between the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers. Scott became a full-time MLB umpire in 1986, working 116 games that season. Scott worked a total of 3,897 regular season games, 91 post-season games, and issued 90 ejections in his MLB career.

Scott umpired in the World Series in 1998, 2001 and 2004, in the All-Star Game in 1993, 2001, and 2011, calling balls and strikes. He has also worked in six League Championship Series (1996, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2009, 2013) and in twelve Division Series (1995, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2015).

When the AL introduced red shirts in 1996, Scott frequently was the only umpire to wear the color, rather than the usual navy blue. He almost always wore the red shirt when working home plate, including Game 3 of the 1998 World Series at Qualcomm Stadium.

Scott worked his last game on April 14, 2017, in Toronto. In the 8th inning he was struck in the mask and was carted off the field with a concussion and whiplash. This was Scott&#x27;s fourth concussion in five years, his second in nine months. After consulting with several sports medicine and concussion specialists, Scott decided not to return, and announced his retirement in December 2017.

===Notable games===
On May 30, 1988, Scott ejected New York Yankees manager Billy Martin from a game against the Oakland Athletics. Martin was suspended for three games for throwing dirt at Scott during the argument.

On July 1, 1990, Scott was the home plate umpire as Andy Hawkins of the New York Yankees pitched eight hitless innings in a road game against the Chicago White Sox, yet lost; it was, at the time, only the second game in history in which a pitcher lost a complete game no-hitter. In 1991 MLB revised the rules relating to official no-hit games, requiring that a pitcher must complete a minimum of 9 innings, and thereby voiding Hawkins&#x27; effort.

He was the home plate umpire on April 27, 1994, when Scott Erickson threw a no-hitter for the Twins vs the Brewers.

Scott was the first base umpire when Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander threw a no-hitter at Comerica Park against the Milwaukee Brewers on June 12, 2007. Five days prior to Verlander&#x27;s no-hitter, Scott was also at first base in a game between the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics in which Boston pitcher Curt Schilling had a no-hitter until Shannon Stewart broke up the no-hitter with a single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning.

Scott worked his 3,000th career, regular season MLB game in St. Louis on his 50th birthday, August 14, 2009.

He was the third base umpire for Verlander&#x27;s second no-hitter, thrown on May 7, 2011, against the Toronto Blue Jays.

Scott was the third base umpire when six Seattle Mariners pitchers combined to no-hit the Los Angeles Dodgers on June 8, 2012.

He was the second-most tenured umpire selected to officiate the 2014 Opening Series at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Sydney.

Scott was the crew chief for the 2015 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers. He was home plate umpire for game five, in which a controversial moment took place. At the top of the seventh inning, Toronto catcher Russell Martin was in the process of throwing the ball back to pitcher Aaron Sanchez when his throw struck the bat of Texas batter Shin-Soo Choo. Rougned Odor, who was the runner on third, ran home on the play. Scott initially called the play dead and disallowed the run. After a consultation with the other umpires, Scott reversed the decision and allowed the run to count on the grounds that Choo didn&#x27;t intentionally interfere with the throw, and therefore the play was live. This gave the Rangers a lead. Toronto manager John Gibbons advised Scott the Blue Jays were playing under protest, however Toronto would ultimately win the game.

On May 15, 2016, Scott was the crew chief and first base umpire when the Toronto Blue Jays visited the Texas Rangers. This game was the final regular season game between the teams that met in the previous year’s Division Series. Late in the game, a fight broke out between Blue Jays outfielder José Bautista and Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor when Bautista slid late into second base. Scott and home plate umpire Dan Iassogna ejected Bautista, Odor, Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson, Rangers bench coach Steve Buechele, Blue Jays pitcher Jesse Chavez, and bench coach/acting manager DeMarlo Hale. Hale was acting as the Blue Jays’ manager due to the ejection of John Gibbons (along with first base coach Tim Leiper) earlier in the game. Odor and Bautista both served suspensions for their actions. There were a total of eight ejections, the most in a single game since 2000.

==Personal life==
Scott worked as a radio personality at KBDF, a Top 40 station in Eugene, Oregon, in the late 1970s. He is an avid Oregon Ducks football fan and often attends games at Autzen Stadium when given the opportunity. He is friends with baseball commentator Harold Reynolds.

Scott came out as gay in 2014, becoming the first active openly gay umpire in MLB. He is married to Michael Rausch, whom he met at CC Slaughters in Portland in October 1986.

In 2015, Scott was inducted into the National Gay and Lesbian Sports Hall of Fame, and to the Hall of Honor at Sheldon High School in his hometown of Eugene.

In 2022, Scott published his memoir &quot;The Umpire Is Out: Calling the Game and Living My True Self&quot;, co-written with Rob Neyer.

<doc id="1110098" wikidata="Q2696934" url="?curid=1110098" title="Tony La Russa">
<text>Anthony La Russa Jr. (; born October 4, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player, coach, and manager. His MLB career has spanned from 1963 to 2022, in several roles. He is the former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, Oakland Athletics, and Chicago White Sox. In 33 years as a manager, La Russa guided his teams to three World Series titles, six league championships, and 13 division titles. His managerial total of 2,884 MLB wins is second only to Connie Mack&#x27;s.

As a player, La Russa made his major league debut in 1963 and spent parts of five major league seasons with the Kansas City / Oakland Athletics, Atlanta Braves, and Chicago Cubs. After a shoulder injury during the 1964–65 off-season, he returned to college and received a degree from the University of South Florida before playing much of the remainder of his career in the minor leagues until retiring in 1977. He then earned a Juris Doctor degree from Florida State University.

Named manager of the White Sox in the middle of the 1979 season, La Russa guided the team to an American League West division title four seasons later. In the middle of the 1986 season, he was fired by the White Sox and hired less than three weeks later by the Athletics. La Russa led the A&#x27;s to three consecutive American League championships from 1988 to 1990 and the 1989 World Series title. He left Oakland after the 1995 season to manage the Cardinals, whom he led to three National League championships and the and 2011 World Series titles. La Russa retired after winning the 2011 title and 34 seasons as a major league manager. Three months later, he accepted a position helping fellow former manager Joe Torre, the executive vice president for MLB operations. In 2014, he became the chief baseball officer for the Arizona Diamondbacks. In November 2019, he joined the Los Angeles Angels as a senior advisor of baseball operations. In the 2021 offseason, he was named the manager of the White Sox; he retired in 2022 due to health concerns.

In 2013, La Russa was unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame by the 16-member Veterans Committee. The induction ceremony was held at Cooperstown, New York, on July 27, 2014. On August 16, 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum.

==Early life==
Born in Tampa, Florida, on October 4, 1944, to Anthony and Olivia (Cuervo) La Russa, Anthony Jr.&#x27;s paternal grandparents had emigrated from Italy (Sicily) and his mother&#x27;s family from Spain. He was raised in nearby Ybor City, Florida, where his parents had met while they were working in the local cigar factory.

The La Russa family moved to West Tampa, Florida, where Tony played American Legion baseball and PONY League baseball alongside teammate Lou Piniella.

After graduating from Jefferson High School in Tampa, La Russa was signed by the Kansas City Athletics in June 1962 as a middle infielder, with a clause that the Athletics pay for his college education at the University of South Florida.

==Professional playing career==
La Russa made his major league debut with the Kansas City A&#x27;s on May 10, 1963, after having played 76 games with A&#x27;s affiliates Binghamton Triplets and Daytona Beach Islanders in 1962. He spent the entire 1963 season in the majors, as was required by his signing as a &quot;bonus baby&quot;. He had suffered an off-season shoulder injury while playing softball with friends, and this limited him to only 34 games in 1963, in which he hit .250. The injured shoulder bothered him through the remainder of his playing career.

Over the next six seasons, La Russa spent most of his time in the minor leagues. He made it back up to the A&#x27;s, which had since moved to Oakland, in 1968 and 1969. He spent the entire 1970 season with the A&#x27;s, and then late in 1971 the A&#x27;s traded him to the Atlanta Braves. His final big league playing stop was with the Chicago Cubs, where he appeared as a pinch runner in one game, on April 6, 1973, scoring the walk-off winning run. He also spent time in the organizations of the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago White Sox, and St. Louis Cardinals.

In total, he played 132 major-league games, 40 in the starting lineup. He went 35-for-176, for a batting average of .199. His 23 walks pushed his on-base percentage to .292. He had 7 RBI and scored 15 runs. He made 63 appearances at second base, 18 at shortstop, and two at third base, fielding .960 in 249 total chances and participating in 34 double plays.

It was as a player with the A&#x27;s that La Russa first met catcher Dave Duncan, who would join his coaching staff in Chicago in 1983. The two worked together on every La Russa-managed team thereafter, and he often credits Duncan as playing a key role in his success.

==Managerial career==
===Early career===
Having started coursework following his A&#x27;s signing in 1962, La Russa graduated from the University of South Florida in 1969 with a degree in Industrial Management. He earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Florida State University College of Law in 1978. and was admitted to the Florida Bar on July 30, 1980. He is associated with a Sarasota law firm although he is not eligible to practice at this time. La Russa has been quoted as saying, &quot;I decided I&#x27;d rather ride the buses in the minor leagues than practice law for a living.&quot; Shortly before graduating from FSU College of Law, La Russa spoke with one of his professors about his post-graduation plans, indicating to his professor that he had an opportunity to coach in the minor leagues and asking his professor what he should do. La Russa&#x27;s professor responded, &quot;Grow up, you&#x27;re an adult now, you&#x27;re going to be a lawyer.&quot;

He is one of a select number of major league managers in baseball history who have graduated from law school or passed a state bar exam; others include James Henry O&#x27;Rourke (Buffalo Bisons, 1881–84, Washington Senators, 1893), John Montgomery Ward (New York Giants, Brooklyn and Providence, late 1800s), Hughie Jennings (Detroit, 1907–20, New York Giants, 1924), Miller Huggins (St. Louis Cardinals and New York Yankees, 1913–29), Muddy Ruel (St. Louis Browns, 1947), Jack Hendricks (St. Louis Cardinals, 1918, Cincinnati, 1924–29), and Branch Rickey (St. Louis Browns, 1913–15, St. Louis Cardinals, 1919–25).

=== Chicago White Sox (1979–1986)===
La Russa credits Loren Babe and Paul Richards of the White Sox organization for helping him to become a manager. The White Sox gave La Russa his first managerial opportunity in 1978 by naming him skipper of their Double-A affiliate, the Knoxville Sox of the Southern League. La Russa spent a half-season at Knoxville before being promoted to the White Sox coaching staff when owner Bill Veeck changed managers from Bob Lemon to Larry Doby. Doby was fired at the end of the season; Don Kessinger, former star shortstop of the crosstown Cubs, was named the White Sox&#x27; player-manager for 1979, and La Russa was named manager of the Triple-A Iowa Oaks of the American Association, choosing to manage in the minors after the White Sox had offered him his same major league coaching role.

The White Sox fired Kessinger with a 46–60 record two-thirds of the way through the 1979 season and replaced him with La Russa. The White Sox played .500 baseball (27–27) for the rest of the 1979 campaign. LaRussa, at 34, was the youngest manager in the major leagues. La Russa was named American League Manager of the Year in 1983, when his club won the AL West but fell to the Baltimore Orioles in the American League Championship Series.

The White Sox fired La Russa after the club got off to a 26–38 start in 1986. In 1986, general manager Roland Hemond, who had hired La Russa as White Sox manager, was replaced by the White Sox&#x27; broadcaster Ken Harrelson as general manager. Harrelson then fired both La Russa and coach Dave Duncan during the season. Ironically, Harrelson and La Russa were teammates at Binghamton in 1962. In later years, White Sox Owner Jerry Reinsdorf expressed regret for allowing La Russa to be fired. La Russa finished his first White Sox career with a 522–510 regular season record and a 1–3 postseason record, but added another 156–134 record in 2021–2022. Decades later, Hemond said of La Russa: &quot;Tony La Russa is one of the most brilliant managers that I ever encountered in my baseball career. He saw things other people didn&#x27;t see. There were some managers who thought he was out of line with what he was trying to do, but later on they had to respect him because it was working. There&#x27;s no question he changed the way the game is played.&quot; La Russa is also commonly credited for the advent of the modern specialized bullpen.

===Oakland Athletics (1986–1995)===

La Russa had a break of less than three weeks before his old club, the Athletics, called him to take over as manager. La Russa and Duncan both joined the A&#x27;s, inheriting a team that was 31–52 and in 7th place. They went 45–34 the rest of the season to finish in 3rd place in 1986.

La Russa managed the Oakland A&#x27;s to three consecutive American League Pennants and World Series appearances from 1988 to 1990. The A&#x27;s lost the 1988 World Series to manager Tommy Lasorda and the Los Angeles Dodgers. The following year, the A&#x27;s swept the earthquake-delayed Bay Area 1989 World Series against the San Francisco Giants. In their third consecutive appearance, the favored A&#x27;s faced manager Lou Piniella, LaRussa&#x27;s childhood teammate and friend, and his Cincinnati Reds in the 1990 World Series. The A&#x27;s were swept in the series. In both 1988 and 1990 the A&#x27;s had swept the Boston Red Sox 4–0 in the ALCS, after winning 100 and 99 games respectively. The 1988 World Series was made famous by the Kirk Gibson game-winning home run off of A&#x27;s closer Dennis Eckersley. La Russa earned two American League Manager of the Year awards with the A&#x27;s, in 1988 and 1992, giving him three AL awards, the latter after again winning the Western Division.

After the 1995 season, in which the A&#x27;s finished 67–77, the Haas family, with whom La Russa had a close personal relationship, sold the team after the death of patriarch Walter A. Haas, Jr. In the off-season, La Russa left Oakland to take over for the fired Joe Torre as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals. La Russa had a 798–673 regular season record and a 19–13 postseason record with Oakland.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1996–2011)===
In his first campaign with the Cardinals in 1996, the team clinched the National League Central division title (and also finished National League runner-up), a feat his clubs repeated in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2009. The Cardinals also tied for the National League Central crown with the Houston Astros in 2001. In 2002, La Russa became the first manager to win the Manager of the Year award four times. His fourth award was arguably the most emotional; La Russa led the Cardinals to the National League Championship Series (where they ultimately lost in five games to the San Francisco Giants) in a year in which the Cardinals were traumatized by the deaths of beloved Hall of Fame broadcaster Jack Buck and 33-year-old pitcher Darryl Kile just four days later. On September 10, 2003, he won his 2,000th career game as a manager against the Colorado Rockies, becoming the seventh to reach the mark in Major League Baseball.

The 2004 team played one of the finest seasons in Cardinals&#x27; history, as they won 105 games. After a regular season in which the Cardinals led the NL in runs scored (855) while allowing the fewest (659), La Russa&#x27;s Cardinals defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series, 3 games to 1. St. Louis then took on the Houston Astros in the National League Championship Series. In a tense series with opposing pitcher Roger Clemens at the top of his game, Cardinals third baseman Scott Rolen hit a game-winning two-run home run off Clemens in Game 7 following Jim Edmonds&#x27; rally saving catch. This home run sent the Cardinals to the World Series for the first time since 1987. However, they were swept in four games by a historic Boston Red Sox team that had just surmounted a 3–0 deficit against the New York Yankees and captured their first championship since 1918.
In , the Cardinals returned to the World Series, this time with a 4–1 victory over the Detroit Tigers. The team&#x27;s 83–78 regular season record is the worst ever by an eventual World Series champion, usurping the 1987 Minnesota Twins&#x27; 85–77 campaign. La Russa became the second manager to win a World Series in both the American League and National League – a distinction shared with his mentor Sparky Anderson.

When he came to St. Louis, La Russa wore number 10 to symbolize the team&#x27;s drive to their 10th championship and pay tribute to Anderson, who wore number 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds. After winning the championship, he chose to continue wearing number 10 to pay tribute to Anderson.

La Russa led the Cardinals to the 2011 World Series, after defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS (3–2), and then the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS (4–2). The Cardinals defeated the Texas Rangers in Game 7 of the World Series to win the franchise&#x27;s 11th World Championship, and the third of La Russa&#x27;s managerial career. He passed Bobby Cox for 2nd place on the all-time postseason wins list with his 68th win in Game 3. Three days following the World Series win, La Russa announced his retirement, ranking second all-time in postseason wins with 70, third all-time with 2,728 regular season wins, second with 5,097 games managed, and second with 33 years (tied) managing with John McGraw. He finished his Cardinals career with a 1408–1182 regular season record and 50–42 postseason record.

La Russa also became the first manager in Major League Baseball history to retire in the same season after winning a World Series title. Even though he had retired, La Russa managed the National League All Stars in the 2012 MLB All-Star Game for the final time as a member of the Cardinals. The National League won 8–0.

===Return to Chicago White Sox (2021–2022)===
After serving in various executive roles for MLB and for several teams, La Russa was announced as the manager of the White Sox on October 29, 2020, replacing Rick Renteria. At 76, La Russa became the oldest manager in MLB. He also became the first manager in baseball history to return to managing after being elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame as a manager. (Connie Mack was elected in 1937, before his retirement). A. J. Hinch was known to be another finalist, but was hired by the Detroit Tigers instead when the White Sox decided on La Russa.

On June 6, 2021, La Russa passed John McGraw for second place in all-time managerial wins. La Russa led the White Sox to their first AL Central division title since 2008; it was La Russa&#x27;s 13th division title as a manager. They lost to the Houston Astros in the 2021 ALDS in four games.

In 2022, at 77 years of age, La Russa was the oldest manager in major league baseball, four years older than Dusty Baker. The 2022 season proved to be a tough one for both the White Sox and La Russa. On June 9, La Russa faced criticism for a late-game decision that backfired on him. The White Sox were trailing 7–5 to the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Dodgers had a runner on second base in the top of the 6th inning. With a count of 1–2 on Trea Turner, La Russa issued an intentional walk on Turner to send him to first base. The decision immediately backfired as the next batter, Max Muncy, hit a home run just a few pitches later that made the score 9–5 in an eventual win for the Dodgers. La Russa defended his decision saying &quot;that wasn&#x27;t a tough call&quot; and that he would do it again. A month later, La Russa did in fact do it again on August 19 against the Cleveland Guardians, when he issued an intentional walk on Oscar González with a 1–2 count, this time down by three runs in the bottom of the 7th, although it did not result in a subsequent home run. On August 30, La Russa, under the advice of a cardiologist he had seen about his heart, elected to not manage the impending game versus Kansas City. The next day, he went further testing and received an advisement to see a heart specialist. On that same day, the White Sox announced that La Russa was out indefinitely, with bench coach Miguel Cairo taking over as interim manager. At that point, the White Sox were 63–65. On October 3, La Russa announced that he was retiring effective immediately.

===Managerial record===

As of games played on August 26, 2022.

==Executive career==
Shortly after his retirement from the playing field, La Russa took a position with MLB assisting former managerial rival Joe Torre in matters of on-field discipline. He held this position for more than two seasons.

On May 17, 2014, La Russa accepted a position as Chief Baseball Officer for the Arizona Diamondbacks to oversee the entire baseball operations department.

After joining the Diamondbacks in 2014, La Russa was reunited with former assistants Duncan and McKay, and the general manager who hired him to manage the White Sox in 1979, Roland Hemond. On December 4, 2015, the Diamondbacks agreed to a six-year contract with free agent pitcher Zack Greinke worth a total of $206.5 million. At that time, it held the highest annual average value in MLB, exceeding $34.4 million per year, and was also the largest contract by total value in team history. La Russa was demoted to Chief Baseball Analyst/Advisor with the Diamondbacks following a disappointing 93-loss season in 2016, which also resulted in the firing of general manager Dave Stewart and manager Chip Hale. Following the 2017 season, La Russa resigned.

In November 2017, the Boston Red Sox announced that La Russa had joined the team as vice president and special assistant to Dave Dombrowski, the president of baseball operations. In making the announcement, the Red Sox indicated that La Russa would assist with player development, serve as an advisor to the team&#x27;s coaches at the major and minor league levels, and serve as a consultant for Alex Cora, the team&#x27;s major league manager. La Russa worked with the Red Sox for two seasons, and after Dombrowski was released by the Red Sox during the 2019 season, the Los Angeles Angels hired La Russa as senior adviser for baseball operations in November 2019. In 2023, he returned to the White Sox as an advisor.

==Legacy==
La Russa is second in major league history in victories as a manager (2,884), trailing only Connie Mack (3,731) and surpassing John McGraw (2,763) on June 6, 2021. He managed 5,097 games, joining Mack as the second manager or coach in American sports history to reach 5,000 games. In 2004, he became the sixth manager in history to win pennants with both American and National League teams; in 2006 he became the first manager ever to win multiple pennants in both leagues and the second manager to win the World Series in both leagues. La Russa has also joined Mack as the second manager to win World Series titles in three decades and to win pennants in four. He is one of only four managers to be named Manager of the Year in both of baseball&#x27;s major leagues.

La Russa is the winningest manager in St. Louis Cardinals history, with 1,408 wins and 1,182 losses (.544) and one tie, managing the Cardinals from 1996 to 2011. He was 522–510–3 (.506) with the Chicago White Sox 1979–1986, leading the club to its first postseason appearance in 24 years in 1983, and 798–673 (.542) with the Oakland Athletics 1986–1995, winning three consecutive AL pennants from 1988 to 1990; he also holds the record for victories by an Athletics manager since the franchise relocated to Oakland in 1968. 

La Russa became the leader in wins by Cardinals&#x27; managers on August 31, 2007, when the Cardinals defeated the Cincinnati Reds 8–5, passing Red Schoendienst (1,041–955) to take the title. He managed his 2,500th win against the Royals at Kansas City on June 21, 2009, becoming only the third manager to attain that win level after Mack and McGraw.

After the retirement of Atlanta Braves manager Bobby Cox in 2010, La Russa was the longest tenured manager in Major League Baseball, and with the resignation of longtime NBA head coach Jerry Sloan from the Utah Jazz on February 10, 2011, La Russa had been the longest tenured bench boss among all the Big Four sports leagues, until his retirement following his 2011 World Series victory with the Cardinals.

La Russa became eligible as a candidate for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013 through voting by the Expansion Era Committee for induction in 2014. On November 4, 2013, La Russa&#x27;s inclusion on the Expansion Era ballot was announced with fellow former Cardinals Ted Simmons, Joe Torre and Dan Quisenberry. The Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America&#x27;s Historical Overview Committee listed the candidates on the ballot and voted the following December 8. La Russa was inducted into the 2014 Hall of Fame class as a manager.

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced La Russa among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.

In 2012, he became the second manager to manage the All-Star Game (2012) after retiring since John McGraw in 1933. With his All-Star Game 8–0 win in Kansas City, he became the first manager to win an All-Star Game in both leagues.

==Personal life==

La Russa and his second wife, Elaine, are the founders of Tony La Russa&#x27;s Animal Rescue Foundation, headquartered in Walnut Creek, California, which saves abandoned and injured animals as well as running programs to bring dogs and cats to abused children, hospital patients, seniors and shut-ins. La Russa is a vegetarian. The La Russas have two daughters, Bianca and Devon, and reside in Alamo, California.

La Russa has two older daughters, Andrea and Averie, from his first marriage to Luzette Sarcone. La Russa and Sarcone divorced in 1973 and Sarcone received full custody of their daughters. La Russa married Elaine Coker shortly after his divorce to Sarcone became official.

La Russa is also personal friends with celebrities outside the sports world, such as pianist and songwriter Bruce Hornsby, Bruce Springsteen, jazz bassist Christian McBride, and heavy metal musician Robb Flynn from the band Machine Head. In 2007, at a concert in San Francisco on La Russa&#x27;s birthday, Hornsby played a comedic song he named &quot;Hooray For Tony&quot;. The original song, titled &quot;Hooray For Tom&quot;, is La Russa&#x27;s favorite Hornsby song. In the &quot;Hooray For Tony&quot; version, Hornsby mentions the &quot;Bash Brothers&quot; Mark McGwire and José Canseco (from La Russa&#x27;s days as the manager of the Oakland A&#x27;s), Albert Pujols, Jim Edmonds, ARF, and La Russa&#x27;s World Series Championships.

La Russa is a graduate of the University of South Florida (Bachelor of Arts in industrial management, 1969) and the Florida State University College of Law (Juris Doctor, 1978).

La Russa has Italian and Spanish ancestry, and speaks fluent Spanish. His father&#x27;s parents were migrants from the Italian island of Sicily and his mother&#x27;s family originated from Spain. Having a father who could speak Spanish and Italian and a mother who could speak Spanish, La Russa claimed in a 2008 interview that &quot;Spanish was my first language&quot;. He was inducted into the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. La Russa was also inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame on April 11, 2008, in a pregame ceremony at AT&amp;T Park.

La Russa and his family had an uncredited extra role in the film &quot;Angels in the Outfield&quot;. The La Russas also made an appearance in an episode of &quot;Housecat Housecall&quot;, a reality show on Animal Planet presented by Purina Cat Chow, during the show&#x27;s third season, which began on June 5, 2010. In 1980, La Russa appeared as a contestant on the game show &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;, and helped fool the celebrity panel.

In June 2010, La Russa was asked about a tea party protest taking place during his game against the Arizona Diamondbacks that criticized the Diamondbacks&#x27; position against the controversial new Arizona immigration statute. La Russa expressed support for the Tea Partiers&#x27; right to free speech to protest at the ballpark. He also stated, &quot;I&#x27;m actually a supporter of what Arizona is doing... you know if people don&#x27;t fix their problems they have to take care of it themselves&quot;.

La Russa and Pujols attended Glenn Beck&#x27;s &quot;Restoring Honor&quot; rally on August 28, 2010, in Washington, D.C., while the Cardinals were in town for a series against the Washington Nationals. La Russa decided to attend after being told by Beck that the rally was not political in nature.

Throughout the 2011 season, La Russa struggled with shingles. He originally disclosed that it was conjunctivitis, however, on May 10, after a visit to the Mayo Clinic (Scottsdale, Arizona), he disclosed that he was dealing with a case of shingles, and had to take off a few days for treatment and rest. Because bench coach Joe Pettini was named &#x27;acting manager&#x27; instead of &#x27;interim manager&#x27;, La Russa was credited for all wins and losses during his absence.

On June 4, 2009, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; reported that La Russa had sued the online social network platform Twitter the previous month for a fake page established under his name on the site. La Russa claimed that he had &quot;suffered significant emotional distress (and) damage to reputation&quot; because of the profile. The fake profile made several &quot;distasteful references&quot; to La Russa and his team, according to the suit. Twitter&#x27;s terms of service forbids impersonation directly, stating that users &quot;may not impersonate others through the Twitter service in a manner that does or is intended to mislead, confuse, or deceive others.&quot; Reports that Twitter had settled (&quot;the first celebrity lawsuit against the 32-million-user site&quot;, according to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;) were rebuffed on the official Twitter blog. La Russa eventually filed a request to dismiss the suit, while Twitter, whether in regard to the suit or not, continued improving its privacy protections.

In May 2014, La Russa served as the Washington University in St. Louis commencement speaker.

===Legal issues===
On March 22, 2007, La Russa was arrested in Jupiter, Florida, for suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. He was found asleep at the wheel of his running SUV with the car in park at an intersection. He was booked at the Palm Beach County Jail and blew a .093 blood alcohol content, above the legal limit of .08. Calling his arrest on the DUI charge an &quot;embarrassment&quot;, La Russa apologized to &quot;anyone who is close to me, members of the Cardinals organization, our fans.&quot; He was defended by the organization and some players, such as Albert Pujols. On November 28, 2007, La Russa pleaded guilty to DUI, saying that it was in the best interest of all concerned. In a statement released by his attorney, La Russa said, &quot;I accept full responsibility for my conduct, and assure everyone that I have learned a very valuable lesson and that this will never occur again&quot;.

In February 2020, La Russa was charged with DUI again, this time in Phoenix; the case was filed on October 28, 2020, a day before he was rehired by the White Sox.

===Health===
By 2022, his last season as a manager, La Russa was diagnosed with cancer, and had lingering issues with his pacemaker.

==In other media==
In 1980, La Russa appeared as the subject in a round of the Robin Ward-hosted version of &quot;To Tell The Truth&quot;. Panelist Nipsey Russell seemed perplexed that there was another Chicago baseball team besides the Cubs. One of the imposters before the panel, when queried as to who was his best player at the moment, swiftly responded Todd Cruz. This resulted in him receiving votes. But he did not completely stump the panel.

In 2012, La Russa released his &quot;New York Times&quot; bestselling memoir, &quot;One Last Strike&quot;, which recounts his legendary last season as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals and their remarkable journey to becoming the 2011 World Series Champions from ten and a half games back.

In 2005, La Russa was the focus of a book by sportswriter Buzz Bissinger. Bissinger&#x27;s &quot;Three Nights in August&quot; delves into La Russa&#x27;s role as manager during a 3-game series in 2003 between his Cardinals and manager Dusty Baker&#x27;s Chicago Cubs, their longtime rivals. The book received much praise from both fans and critics, though some complained that Bissinger sets out to glorify La Russa&#x27;s &quot;old school&quot; managerial style as a direct challenge to the statistical analysis theses of Michael Lewis&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;&quot;.

As David Leonhardt of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the &quot;stats vs. hunches&quot; debate in an August 29, 2005 piece, &quot;what makes this fight truly comparable to those that periodically roil the world of art history or foreign policy is that the differences between the sides are not as great as the sniping between them suggests. La Russa spends much of his time jotting down information on index cards and studying statistics in his office.&quot;

George Will&#x27;s book &quot;Men at Work&quot; likewise depicted La Russa and his long-time pitching coach Dave Duncan as making more use of statistical analysis than any other team in the major leagues (this book was published in 1990, more than a decade before the &quot;&quot; revolution).

La Russa also provided the AI for a series of successful video games, &quot;Tony La Russa Baseball&quot; (1991–1997). The games won numerous awards and featured &quot;new&quot; statistics selected with La Russa (and provided by prominent sabermetrics authors John Thorn and Pete Palmer) as tools for players as they managed their teams.

<text>Brian Scott Gorman (born June 11, 1959) is an American former umpire in Major League Baseball. After working in the National League from 1991 to 1999, he umpired in both leagues from 2000-2021. Gorman was promoted to crew chief in 2010. He is the son of Tom Gorman, who served as an NL umpire from 1951 to 1977. He wore uniform number 9 throughout his career. 

Born in Whitestone, Queens, he moved with his family as a child to Closter, New Jersey.

After graduating from the University of Delaware, he began umpiring in the minor leagues in 1982, eventually reaching the American Association before being promoted to the NL. He umpired in three World Series (2004, 2009, 2012) and in two All-Star Games (1998 and 2009). He has also umpired in the 2014 National League Wild Card Game, seven American League Championship Series (2002, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018), and in 10 Division Series (1997, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2012).

<text>Canada was a French colony within the larger territory of New France. It was claimed by France in 1535 during the second voyage of Jacques Cartier, in the name of the French king, Francis I. The colony remained a French territory until 1763, when it became a British colony known as the Province of Quebec.

In the 16th century the word &quot;Canada&quot; could refer to the territory along the Saint Lawrence River (then known as the Canada River) from Grosse Isle to a point between Québec and Trois-Rivières. The terms &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;New France&quot; were also used interchangeably. French explorations continued west &quot;unto the Countreys of Canada, Hochelaga, and Saguenay&quot; before any permanent settlements were established. In 1600 a permanent trading post and habitation was established at Tadoussac at the confluence of the Saguenay and Saint Lawrence rivers. However, because this trading post was under a trade monopoly, it was not constituted as an official French colonial settlement.

The first official settlement of Canada was Québec, founded by Samuel de Champlain in 1608. The other four colonies within New France were Hudson&#x27;s Bay to the north, Acadia and Newfoundland to the east, and Louisiana far to the south. Canada became the most developed of the five colonies of New France. It was divided into three districts, Québec, Trois-Rivières, and Montreal, each with its own government. The governor of the District of Quebec also served as the governor-general for all of New France.

The Seven Years&#x27; War of 1756–1763 saw Great Britain defeat the French and their allies, and take possession of Canada. In the Treaty of Paris of 1763, which formally ended the Seven Years&#x27; War, France ceded Canada in exchange for other colonies, with a large portion of Canada becoming the British colony of the Province of Quebec.

==Territorial evolution==
In the 240 years between Verrazano&#x27;s voyage of exploration in 1524 and the Conquest of New France in 1763, the French marked the North American continent in many ways. Whether it was through by land distribution and clearing, the establishment of villages and towns, deploying a network of roads and paths or developing the territory with various constructions, the French colonists transformed and adapted the environments according to their needs.

There are three major periods of expansion of the territory of Canada, mostly as a result of exploration efforts. First, the 1534–1603 period, in which Canada&#x27;s territory comprised the coasts of Newfoundland, the entirety of Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and the coasts of New Brunswick, the Saint Lawrence River and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

Then 1603–1673, in which, due to westward expansion and conflicts with Great Britain, the Canada territory was now composed of the coasts of the Saint Lawrence River, of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and of the Great Lakes, as well as southern Ontario and northern New England.

Then, in the last period of 1673–1741, the Canada territory was composed of the coasts of the Saint Lawrence River, of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and of the Great Lakes, southern Ontario, southern Manitoba and the north-eastern Midwest. It is in this period that Canada was at its largest.


Dependent on Canada were the (upper countries), a vast territory north and west of Montreal, covering the whole of the Great Lakes and stretching as far into the North American continent as the French had explored. Before 1717, when it ceded territory to the new colony of Louisiana, it stretched as far south as the Illinois Country. In the Great Lakes area, a mission, Sainte-Marie among the Hurons, was established in 1639. Following the destruction of the Huron homeland in 1649 by the Iroquois, the French destroyed the mission themselves and left the area. In what are today Ontario and the eastern prairies, various trading posts and forts were built such as Fort Kaministiquia in 1679 (at modern Thunder Bay, Ontario), Fort Frontenac in 1673 (today&#x27;s Kingston, Ontario), Fort Saint Pierre in 1731 (near modern Fort Frances, Ontario), Fort Saint Charles in 1732 (on Lake of the Woods located on Magnusens Island on the Northwest Angle of Minnesota) and Fort Rouillé in 1750 (today&#x27;s Toronto). The mission and trading post at Sault Ste. Marie (1688) would later be split by the Canada–US border.

The French settlements in the among and south of the Great Lakes were Fort Niagara (1678) (near modern Youngstown, New York), Fort Crevecoeur (1680) (near the present site of Creve Coeur, Illinois, a suburb of Peoria, Illinois), Fort Saint Antoine (1686) (on Lake Pepin in Wisconsin), Fort St. Joseph (1691) (on the southernmost point of St. Joseph Island, Ontario on Lake Huron), Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit (1701) (today&#x27;s Detroit, Michigan), Fort Michilimackinac (1715) (on the Straits of Mackinac at Mackinaw City, Michigan), Fort Miami (1715) (modern Fort Wayne, Indiana), Fort La Baye (1717) (today&#x27;s Green Bay, Wisconsin), and Fort Beauharnois (1727) (in Florence Township, Goodhue County, Minnesota).

Today, the term refers to a regional county municipality in the Laurentides region of the present Province of Quebec, north of Montreal, while the former was part of the District of Montreal.

=== Domaine du roy ===
The &quot;Domaine du roy&quot;, established in 1652, was a vast region of New France, which stretched north from the St. Lawrence River to Hudson Bay. It was located between the eastern limit of the seigneurie of Les Éboulements and Cape Cormorant. The territory had an area of more than 460,000km2. After the Conquest of New France, the territory&#x27;s name was changed to Rupert&#x27;s Land.

== Population surveys ==
A population survey was done in 1740 to estimate Canada&#x27;s population. The survey of the Saint Lawrence River valley counted about 44,000 colonists in total. The majority of them were born in Canada and lived in a rural environment. Of the colonists, 18,000 lived under the Government of Québec, 4,000 under the Government of Trois-Rivières and 22,000 under the Government of Montreal. As for colonists not living in the Saint Lawrence River valley, Île Royale (now Cape Breton) counted 4,000 inhabitants (of which 1,500 were in Louisbourg), and Île Saint-Jean (now Prince Edward Island) had 500 inhabitants.

== Successors and legacy ==
In 1791, the Province of Quebec was separated into Lower Canada (now Quebec) and Upper Canada (now Ontario). Lower Canada and Upper Canada were fused into the Province of Canada in 1841, before separating again into the modern-day provinces of Quebec and Ontario during the Confederation of Canada in 1867. Because of the historical and geographical continuity, as well as the continued use of the French language, civil law, customs, cultural aspects and the ruling power of the Catholic Church in government until the Quiet Revolution of the 1960s, the province of Quebec is considered by many to be the modern-day continuation of the Canada colony of New France. Still today, the majority of the Quebec population is descended from the original French-speaking &quot;Canadien&quot; of Canada, and the cultural distinctiveness of Quebec from the rest of the country has led to the emergence of a Québécois identity and the Quebec sovereignty movement. Descendants of the original of Canada (New France) living outside of Quebec are now often referred to by a name which references their province of residence (ex. Franco-Ontarian). Francophone populations in the Maritime provinces, however, are more likely to be descended from the settlers of the French colony of Acadia. They are therefore called Acadians.

<doc id="1110102" wikidata="Q1439838" url="?curid=1110102" title="Giftpia">
<text>, stylized as &quot;GiFTPiA&quot;, is a video game, developed by Skip Ltd. for the GameCube. It was released in Japan on April 25, 2003. Nintendo cancelled the North American localization of &quot;Giftpia&quot;. In English, the game would most likely be better understood as called &quot;Giftopia&quot; to represent the two words, gift and utopia.

Although the game hasn&#x27;t been localized for Western territories as of 2023, a script translation can be found in the Kirameki website, which contains the dialogues for all of its playable chapters, properly translated to English.

==Plot and gameplay==

&quot;Giftpia&quot; follows the protagonist Pockle, a resident of Nanashi Island, who, on the day of his coming of age ceremony, oversleeps and misses the whole thing. The mayor of the island, Mayer, is so incensed that he orders Pockle&#x27;s arrest and a fine of five million &quot;Mane&quot; (the game&#x27;s currency) to recoup the costs of the event. Thus, it is up to Pockle to work off his huge debt. At the game&#x27;s start, Pockle must cope with heavy restrictions: an early curfew, a ball &amp; chain, having his face pixelated and having robot police chief Mappo supervise him. Throughout his adventure, Pockle is assisted by his dog Tao and his girlfriend Kyappa. There is also a large cast of supporting characters that live on Nanashi Island and interact with Pockle, including a bartender that goes by Peevee and a radio DJ called DEEJ. Pockle eventually encounters an old man who will give him some mushroom soup and teach him about other paths to adulthood via helping others.

&quot;Giftpia&quot; is similar to Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; in that both games place an emphasis on interacting with other characters. In order to meet the game&#x27;s five million Mane requirement, the player must initially take menial jobs such as fishing, collecting fruit, or repairing signs. After meeting the old man, the player must travel the island, collecting its residents&#x27; wishes, and fulfill them. However, the player has numerous restrictions that are lifted as the game progresses. For instance, if the player stays out after curfew, ghosts will chase Pockle to his house. If he does not make it back, he will be put to sleep, making him vulnerable to theft. The player is also responsible for making Pockle eat, as he will otherwise starve to death.

==Development==
&quot;GiFTPiA&quot; was announced in early 2002 under the development of Skip Ltd. and the direction of former Square employee Kenichi Nishi. Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto signed on as one of the game&#x27;s producers. According to the Japanese newspaper &quot;Nihon Keizai Shimbun&quot;, Nintendo provided half of the game&#x27;s ¥500 million budget.

Although the game was shown at E3 2003 in English and a North American localization seemed likely, the game remained exclusive to Japan. Nintendo stated that the game was not announced for a North America release. The website IGN thought that the game was not going to be released due to being &quot;too strange&quot; for US audiences, an assumption that was confirmed by Nintendo of America in early 2006. One of the game&#x27;s planners, Sayoko Yokote, hoped the game would be localized by a company other than Nintendo.

The music in &quot;GiFTPiA&quot; is provided via the in-game radio known as Nanashi-FM. The musical score was co-composed by Hirofumi Taniguchi and Yousuke Obitsumi and features over a dozen musical artists on the radio stations. The soundtrack was released on July 14, 2003, by Enterbrain alongside the &quot;Giftpia Book&quot;, a 99-page full color guide to the game.

==Reception==
Retail sales of &quot;Giftpia&quot; were unexceptional at best. According to estimates from Media Create and &quot;Dengeki&quot;, the game sold between 48,000 and 55,000 units during its first three weeks on sale in Japan. By the end of 2003, the game had sold nearly 70,000 units, ranking it 176th among all games in the country for that year.

&quot;Giftpia&quot; was given a total score of 34 out of 40 by &quot;Famitsu&quot;, earning it a &quot;Gold Award&quot;. The reviewers remarked that although game gives the initial impression it is for children, it offers &quot;nice puzzle elements, great characters and a wonderful score&quot;. &quot;GiFTPiA&quot; was awarded a curious review score of ??% by the UK-based &quot;NGC Magazine&quot;. They felt unable to review it properly, but were sure that there was &quot;...clearly a quite brilliant game lurking beneath the reams of Japanese text&quot;.

<doc id="1110103" wikidata="Q5115621" url="?curid=1110103" title="Chuck Meriwether">
<text>Julius Edward &quot;Chuck&quot; Meriwether (June 30, 1956October 26, 2019) was a Major League Baseball (MLB) umpire. After working in the American League (AL) from 1988 to 1999, he umpired in both leagues from 2000 to 2009. Meriwether originally wore number 32, but in 2004 switched to number 14.

==Career==
After graduating from Athens State College in 1978, he first umpired in the minor leagues in 1979, reaching the American Association in 1986 before continuing up to the AL. He was an umpire in the 2004 World Series and the 2007 World Series, and in the All-Star Game in 1996 and 2002. He also umpired in the 2003 National League Championship Series and the 2006 American League Championship Series, and in eight Division Series (1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2007, and 2009). He was the third base umpire for the single-game playoff to decide the National League&#x27;s 2007 wild card team. He was the third base umpire for David Cone&#x27;s perfect game on July 18, 1999, and the second base umpire for Mark Buehrle&#x27;s perfect game on July 23, 2009.

Upon joining the AL&#x27;s staff, Meriwether became only the fifth African American umpire in major league history, and the first in the AL since Emmett Ashford retired in 1970. Coincidentally, Meriwether was behind the plate when the Boston Red Sox – the last major league team to integrate its roster – won its first World Series in 86 years in 2004, and he was again behind the plate when they won the Series three years later in 2007.

He worked on the same umpiring crew as Eric Cooper, who died six days before Meriwether, in 2004 and 2009. Before the start of the 2010 season, fellow MLB umpire Mike DiMuro wrote on his &quot;Umps Care Blog&quot; that Meriwether would sit out the 2010 season on the disabled list and then retire following the 2010 season. Meriwether did in fact miss the entire season, and retired along with fellow veteran umpires Mike Reilly and Jerry Crawford on February 23, 2011.

The umpire dressing room at Nashville&#x27;s First Horizon Park was named after Meriwether in 2016. At the time of his death, Meriwether was a supervisor of MLB umpires.

==Personal life==
Meriwether&#x27;s son Chris was a walk-on point guard for the Vanderbilt University basketball team from 2008 to 2010.

Meriwether died at his home in Nashville on October 26, 2019, at the age of 63 after a battle with cancer. Later that evening, there was a moment of silence in memory of Meriwether prior to Game 4 of the World Series.

<doc id="1110104" wikidata="Q545539" url="?curid=1110104" title="Trường Chinh">
<text>Trường Chinh (, meaning &quot;Long March&quot;), born Đặng Xuân Khu (9 February 1907 – 30 September 1988) was a Vietnamese communist political leader, revolutionary and theoretician. He was one of the key figures of Vietnamese politics and leaders for over 40 years, and played a major role in the 1946-54 war against the French. Trường also played an important role in shaping the politics of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) and creating the socialist structure of the new Vietnam.

Between November 9, 1940 and November 11, 1945, when the party dissolved, Trường was General Secretary of the Indochinese Communist Party Central Committee. Between 1946 and 1954, the First Indochina War led to the fall of French Indochina and the partitioning of Vietnam between north and south. On February 19, 1951, Trường became First Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Vietnam Central Committee (although Hồ Chí Minh, in his capacity as founder and chairman of the party, was Trường&#x27;s superior). In 1956, after the failure of the Land Reform program, he was dismissed from his post of General Secretary and had less power. Hồ Chí Minh selected Lê Duẩn to succeed him as the General Secretary and Lê became the most powerful person in the party after Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s death in 1969. However, Trường Chinh remained an influential force in the party during the Second Indochina War and after the reunification of Vietnam; he was Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam from 1960 to 1981 and head of state of Vietnam from 1981 to 1987 as 3rd President of Vietnam. Following the death of Lê Duẩn in July 1986, Trường again became General Secretary, and held the post until December 18, 1986. His last vital role was to carry forward the Đổi Mới renovation that still affects Vietnam to this day.

==Early life==
Trường Chinh&#x27;s name at birth was Đặng Xuân Khu. He changed his name to Trường Chinh, which means &quot;Long March&quot;, in honor of the 6,000-mile military retreat of the Red Army of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) between 1934 and 1936 led by Mao Zedong. He was born on February 9, 1907, in the Hành Thiện village, Xuân Hồng sub-district, Xuân Trường district, Nam Định province (in the area of the Red River delta, 120 kilometers from Hanoi). He was the oldest son among five children of the Đặng family which was an important family of the village. His siblings were Đặng Thị Yên, Đặng Thị Uẩn, Đặng Thị Tường, and Đặng Xuân Đỉnh. He grew up in a Confucian family which was not wealthy. His family background and his father highly shaped his knowledge and influenced him to join the anti-colonial movement. He learned Classical Chinese from his father and was sent to the district school.

His grandfather, Đặng Xuân Bảng, was a Confucian intellectual who worked for the Nguyễn court under the reign of Emperor Tự Đức and published many books about history, literature and Confucian ideology written in Hán scripts. His father was Đặng Xuân Viện who was a famous Confucian scholar and wrote many history books. Unlike his grandfather, Viện was not interested to work for the Nguyễn court. Instead, he participated in the Đông Kinh Nghĩa thục (Tonkin Free School) movement against French colonialism in 1907. Trường Chinh&#x27;s mother was Nguyễn Thị Từ (1880-1964) who grew up in a Confucian mandarin family of the Nguyễn court. Trường Chinh married Nguyễn Thi Minh, who remained loyal and carried on the burden of looking after the family, especially her husband&#x27;s family after he was jailed for his political beliefs.

===Leader of student movement===

In the midst of the political and social transition in Indochina, particularly the spread of French educational system in the nineteenth century. Trường Chinh was sent to educate in the French school, which was the starting point for his political movement. In 1923, he was sent to Thành Chung secondary school, the first secondary school for the local people and taught in the Western educational system, located in Nam Định province. In the school, Trường Chinh was inspired by the French philosophers’ works such as Jean-Jacque Rousseau and Montesquieu as well as the French revolution in 1789 and the Chinese revolution in 1911. In Nam Định, he lived with a poor labour family who worked in the industrial factory. His childhood experience urged him to set up a student movement with his schoolmates, Nguyễn Văn Hoan, Đặng Châu Tệ, Phạm Năng Độ, Nguyễn Khắc Lương, and Nguyễn Đức Cảnh. This group, later on, joined the student movement in Tonkin. They published newspapers in order to spread their thoughts on the anti-colonial movement.

In 1925, when Phan Bồi Châu, the respectful nationalist, was captured in China and brought back to Vietnam, Trường Chinh was in the second year in high school. He joined the nationalist movement and printed leaflets together with his friends demanding the release of Phan Bồi Châu. This was the first time he personally participated in a political movement. His second involvement was a year after that. In 1926, the death of Phan Chu Trinh (Phan Châu Trinh), the well-known nationalist, led to the huge protests all over Vietnam. Trường Chinh and his schoolmates asked a permission from the local authority to organize a mourning for Phan Chu Trinh.

Trường Chinh became the head of the student movement in Nam Định and cooperated with other schools. Not only students but peasants, labourers, and villagers numbering more than ten thousand also participated in the Phan Chu Trinh commemoration. The gathering turned violent and, as a result, Trường Chinh and other student leaders were taken away by the police together with more than 200 people. After this event, the French colonial administrators kept an eye on him. He quit school in Nam Định. After that, he did self-study and passed the secondary school level exam. He moved to Hanoi to pursue his study in Indochinese trade college (trường Cao đẳng Thương mại Đông Dương). In Ha Noi, he still focused on political movement with his friends from Nam Định and wrote for newspapers.

=== Road to Communist Party ===

When Trường Chinh was in Ha Noi, he had an opportunity to choose his revolutionary path. In 1928, he joined the national salvation movement together with other Vietnamese young intellectuals. He read widely on Socialist works such as Marx and Engels, and Lenin. In 1929, he was one of first groups that founded the Communist Party of Indochina (1929–1930). He started to work on the Party&#x27;s published works such as &quot;Búa Liềm&quot; newspaper and &quot;Người sinh viên&quot; newspaper aimed to educate the people on the Socialist path; at condemning the French colonial government and at arousing the local mass as to ally with the Party. However, in 1930, the Nghệ Tĩnh-Soviet movement and the Yên Bái mutiny started their own rebellion in Tonkin and this led the French colonial government to purge the political movement in Indochina.

In 1930 Trường Chinh became member of the Communist Party of Vietnam and was appointed to the Committee&#x27;s propaganda of the Central Committee of Communist Party of Indochina. He was caught on November, 14th 1930 and was sentenced to twelve years, but was released in 1936. Although Trường Chinh was imprisoned for his political beliefs Hỏa Lò prison in Hanoi and deported Sơn La prison in Sơn La province for seven years, he was continuously active in the political movement. He was the leader of the Communist movement in the prisons where he published poems, articles, books about socialism and criticism of the Vietnam nationalist Party.

The colonial prison significantly became the revolutionary school for most of the intellectual revolutionists and communists. After release from prison, he continued his political movement, especially through his books and newspaper articles. He was a journalist, a writer, and a socialist intellectual who used his writings under various pennames such as Trường Chinh, Sông Hồng, Tân Trào, T.C. and S.T. to fight the French colonial government since he was a teenager. He was also a strategist for the Indochinese Communist Party.

== Political roles and ideology ==

Trường Chinh&#x27;s ideology was inspired by Marxism and Leninism and he was influenced by Hồ Chí Minh, as seen from his works on including revolutionary ideology, political and revolutionary strategies as well as cultural strategies and policies. According to the Communist Party, Trường Chinh was &quot;Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s excellent student&quot;, although he did not always agree with Ho Chi Minh&#x27;s ideas.

There are two main arguments about Trường Chinh&#x27;s ideology. Firstly, his ideology was seen as radical and based on Mao Zedong Thought which is clearly evident in his published works and the pattern of the land reform program that he had borrowed from China. Secondly, it was a hybrid incorporating Marxism and Leninism that formed the core of Trường Chinh&#x27;s ideology which supported the anti-colonial movement and did not oppose nationalism. His ideology firstly was influenced by the Soviet bloc, after that, China bloc, and was adopted in Vietnam contexts.

=== First Secretary of the Communist Party ===
Trường Chinh played a significant role in the Communist Party during the critical time in building and strengthening the Indochinese Communist Party (ICP) power. Besides Hồ Chí Minh, he was a central figure of the ICP in the independence formation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV). In the 1940s, during the time that Hồ came back to Vietnam, Trường Chinh was already well known among the cadres of the Communist Party. He was portrayed as the radical leader of the Pro-Chinese faction while Hồ led the Pro-Soviet faction. During the Second World War, Trường Chinh became the famous Communist leader in the north. He served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party during a crisis when the French eliminated the leaders of the anti-French movement. In 1940, Trường Chinh was elected as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indochina.

He was the party&#x27;s second ranking leader after Hồ Chí Minh. He was chaired of Party&#x27;s National Conference in northern Tuyên Quang Province, launching an uprising to seize power from the French and Japanese. In the following years, the party fought a war for independence against French colonists.

=== August Revolution in 1945 ===
When Trường Chinh became a leader in the anticolonialist movement, he also adopted the strategic theses of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). He therefore was the person who significantly determined the direction of the communist movement, as well as the think-tank in laying the foundation of modern Vietnam. In fact, he was highly regarded by the members and supporters of the communist movement. In addition, during the anti-colonial period, he and General Võ Nguyên Giáp developed a military strategy that enabled Vietnam to defeat the Japanese forces during the World War II. Trường Chinh emerged to play a crucial role in the August Revolution (Cách mạng tháng 8) in 1945.

However, the political situation in the 1940s was divided into factionalism. The two factions consisted of Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s and Trường Chinh&#x27;s who obviously had different strategies, especially in the 1945 August Revolution. While Ho Chi Minh and his faction were based in Pác Bó in north Vietnam, Trường Chinh and his followers moved down to Hanoi and focused on the Red River delta. The center of the Communist movement, therefore, separated into two centers. After the success of the August Revolution in 1945 and until 1956, Trường Chinh faction was more powerful.

The August Revolution was a major turning point and it led to the declaration of independence in September of the same year. On the day of Vietnam&#x27;s declaration of independence, Trường Chinh was one of the leaders of the Communist Party who stood with Hồ Chí Minh at the Ba Đình Square in Hanoi.

== Land reform campaign in North Vietnam ==

A blot in Trường Chinh&#x27;s political life was the failure of the Land Reform campaign in the DRV between 1953 and 1956. The land reform campaign had a largely impact on Vietnamese society as it challenged the existing social and cultural structure. The land reform campaign was accompanied by extensive repression and excess, which resulted in the false imprisonment and execution of large numbers of people, many of whom were party members. The land reform was proposed and pushed by Trường Chinh as the Secretary of the Workers Party of Vietnam (Đảng Lao động Việt Nam). He aimed to change Vietnam to a new society which was neither feudal nor colonial society. He started developing his ideas of the land reform together with Võ Nguyên Giáp in 1938. Both had published their work &quot;The Peasant Questions&quot; (&quot;Vấn đề dân cày&quot;) which critiqued the social structure in Vietnam and the peasants’ problems in Vietnam. That work is praised from the Communist Party as the foundation of the understanding about agricultural system and Vietnamese peasants’ life.

Before the land reform, the party started implementing tax reduction policies to help farmers. However, later on, the goal was to expand the mass base by allocating land to the peasants who formed the majority in the country, as well as managing the feudal class.

The land reform was debated among the party&#x27;s leaders. Trường Chinh had already been criticized for his unwillingness to agree with other party leaders and for his support of China while other leaders relied on the Soviet Union as their role model. While Trường Chinh was persuaded by other party members to use the Soviet model, he claimed that Vietnam was able to learn from China&#x27;s land reform experience. In Trường Chinh&#x27;s view, the party needed land reform to gain mass support by having a peasant revolution, overthrowing the landlords, and being a step in the liberation of Vietnam.

The party accepted Chinese guidance, because of its close relationship with China&#x27;s leader, Mao Zedong. Trường Chinh admired Mao&#x27;s ideological strategies and he adopted Mao&#x27;s land reform campaign. Scholars have different opinions towards the land reform in Vietnam. Firstly, the land reform in North Vietnam was actually considered as a radical program and the adaptation of the CCP model was implemented between 1946 and 1953. The party leaders also used the land reform campaign &quot;land to the tillers&quot; for economic collectivization. However, another scholar pointed out that although Vietnam was mostly influenced by China, Vietnam&#x27;s adaptation of the Chinese land reform had some differences to suit the Vietnamese context. The achievement of the revolution in China encouraged Vietnam to accept China as a model to design the policy and accept China as a consultant in policy implementation.

Trường Chinh presented the guideline for the land reform in April 1953. The Party passed the land reform decree and provided material support to the farmers. The land reform also aimed to strengthen psychological strategy to gain the support of the peasants. It also aimed to increase productivity and strengthen the war efforts against France. On December 4, 1953, the Legislature passed the Land Reform Act (Luật Cải Cách Ruộng Đất), which marked a significant change as its implementation also purposed at eliminating the feudal system of landlords.

Unlike in China, the land reform failed in Vietnam resulting in famine and widespread starvation. Over almost four years, many criticisms arose from the political leaders and Vietnamese peasants who claimed it a &quot;bloodbath reform&quot; because many people were killed and murdered. In addition, many people died from starvation. In 1956, more violence was reported which led to massive criticism and protests. The land reform was considered a failure of the communist party. Finally, the communist leaders had to terminate the land reform and Trường Chinh took responsibility by resigning from his post as General Secretary of the Communist Party.

However, the land reform was a significant path for the Worker&#x27;s Party and the rural structure. The land reform was successful in, at least, helping the rural peasants to own land. The achievement of the land reform program indicated from the mass support from more than 200,000 peasants who willingly delivered supplies and crossed from mountains to valleys to support the Viet Minh to fight against the French troops.

Even though the land reform program was emphasized by many scholars as the failure of Trường Chinh, Hồ Chí Minh was the mainstay in pushing the program after he had sought advice from Stalin and Mao. After Hồ Chí Minh visited China and personally discussed it with Mao in 1950, the land reform program was finally launched in 1953. This period also marked the closest cordial relations between the CCP and the Worker&#x27;s Party. Mao fully supported both advisor team led by Luo Guibo and provisions not only for the land reform program but also the war against the French.

Criticism was leveled at Trường Chinh and the Communist Party. As a result, the massacres of the people, especially the landowners, were also severely criticized by party members. Many party members preferred to use the Soviet Union path instead. Finally, Hồ Chí Minh, on behalf of the Party apologized with tears for the Party&#x27;s mistake and held Trường Chinh responsible.

The failure of land reform in northern Vietnam was the turning point of the political faction. The Sino-Soviet split reduced China&#x27;s influence in Hanoi. Trường Chinh resigned from his post of the secretary general of the Communist Party of Vietnam. Since then, Hồ Chí Minh supported Lê Duẩn, who later became the most powerful and longest-serving leader in Vietnam. In the 1960s, Lê Duẩn became the most powerful Communist leader while Trường Chinh was still on the list of the Politburo and a member of the central committee of the party. He still maintained his role in the party&#x27;s think tank.

== Cultural ideology and strategy ==
After the declaration of independence in September 1945, Trường Chinh played an important role in shaping the administration of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam politically and economically, as well as creating the socialist structure and culture of the new Vietnam. He considered culture as a vital strategy for national liberation and nation-state building. In Vietnam, Trường Chinh was named as the architect of the foundation of the new culture of Vietnam because his cultural ideology had a great impact on Vietnamese society through many concrete ideas and policies. His works that have affected the Vietnamese society were the 1943 &quot;Theses on Vietnam Culture (Đề Cương Văn hóa Việt Nam)&quot; and the 1948 “the Marxism and Vietnamese Culture” (Chủ nghĩa Mác và vấn đề văn hóa Việt Nam).

In the first work, &quot;Theses on Vietnam Culture,&quot; Trường Chinh presented two main cultural patterns: the foundation of the new Vietnamese culture under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the use of art and cultural concepts as a weapon against national enemies. He argued that Vietnam had fallen under the influence of Chinese culture of feudalism, French colonialism and Japanese fascists. In order to liberate Vietnam from these cultures, the Party needed to create a new culture (văn hóa mới). The essence of the new culture focused on people and adopted a new democratic approach. The second work, &quot;The Marxism and Vietnamese Culture,&quot; Trường Chinh suggested the cultural revolution as a tool to fight the French colonial government under the principle of Marxism. The significance of culture was equal with the military and economic battle fronts. These two works became the fundamental elements to Vietnam society and culture and brought big changes to Vietnam society, particularly after the 1945 August Revolution. The key tool in eliminating the enemies of the nation was the expansion of the new democratic culture into the French-occupied cultural space as well as making the new democratic culture a national culture at the same time.

Cultural policy and the construction of the new culture of Vietnam significantly strengthened the nationalism through arts, performance, media and national history. Trường Chinh significantly built the Cultural Association for National Salvation in order to centralize artists who worked to publicize Party&#x27;s ideology and appeal to local people for support. However, under the atmosphere of social restructuring was a large number of villagers who had some interactions with the landlord families became paranoid and fearful of the communists. The pressure to condemn the public&#x27;s enemies finally led to the destruction of local social networks. Many people in North Vietnam were unable to withstand the pressure. Many of them committed suicide or escaped to South Vietnam.

The process of creating a new cultural space was to equalize people&#x27;s status including anti-feudal symbols and linguistic patterns. The new cultural pattern was not always successful although the Party forced it through the propaganda campaign. In some communities, many villagers still respected the condemned feudal people. The fundamental ideology of Trường Chinh influentially and violently affected north Vietnam, particularly during the land reform. The cultural impact of the land reform led to social turmoil in many communities. Particularly during the land reform, the Party&#x27;s cadres were sent to the communities and violently wiped out what they believed was the feudal legacy and backwardness including superstition, feudal cultures such as clothes, old traditions, and norms.

The landlords were charged with such offenses. Regardless of whether they were supporters of the Communist Party or not, they were judged as exploiters of the peasants. Furthermore, a group of the Communist supporters, called themselves as &quot;Nhân văn giai phẩm&quot; criticized the radical policy of Trường Chinh&#x27;s cultural ideology during the implementation of the Land Reform program. However, many people in this group were jailed or forced to use the labour in the backcountry.

== Đổi Mới (Renovation) ==
Vietnam was unified in 1975, and Trường Chinh was selected president in 1981. The economic renovation was credited to Nguyễn Văn Linh who succeeded General Secretary after Trường Chinh in 1986. However, Trần Nhâm writes that Trường Chinh was the first person who paved the way for economic renovation since 1968. In the midst of economic recession, scarcity and social crisis in the 1980s, the Central Committee received various reports about economic loss, inflations, and the increased social problems. Trường Chinh set up the research teams in order to collect and observe problems in local communities in the Central highland and in southern Vietnam as well as the success and failures from the old economic system.

Trường Chinh came to be receptive to reformists and gradually sided with them after visits to the countryside in 1983. He used the research results to reform policies and presented them to the Sixth National Congress in 1986. He suggested that economic renovation was not enough to deal with the crisis that Vietnam encountered. The Party also needed to reform political and social policies. Furthermore, he asserted that production capacity needed to be increased. Although, Socialist ideology rejected Capitalism, it could not avoid the economic acceleration by increasing production capacity. Instead of focusing on industrial sector, the Party needed to support and increase agricultural production as the root of Vietnam society.

In addition, the 1986 renovation (Đổi Mới) was driven by the changing world order that saw the collapse of the Socialist bloc and the domestic motivation within Vietnam, particularly among the Communist leaders. The economic renovation also affected areas such as politics in Vietnam and relationships among the Communist leaders, the vanishing financial support from the Soviet Union, the diplomatic policy in seeking for the economic cooperation within the region. In this economic transition, Trường Chinh was the new reformer as seen in the fellow communist leader Võ Văn Kiệt&#x27;s writing in which he praised Trường Chinh as the only comrade who completely understood the real ideology of Socialism and also tried to principally adopt it in the society.

However, he was replaced by Nguyễn Văn Linh at the Sixth National Congress in December 1986, part of a sweeping leadership change that marked the beginning of the Đổi mới (&quot;Renovation&quot;) period.

==Final years and death==

He resigned as president in 1987 due to ill health, but continued to serve as advisor to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Vietnam. He died on September 30, 1988, after falling down from the stairs, at the age of 81. His funeral was held at the Ba Đình Hall and he was buried at the Mai Dich Cemetery.

<text>Gerald Sidney Davis (born February 22, 1953) is an American former umpire in Major League Baseball. He worked in the National League from 1982 to 1999 and in Major League Baseball from 2000 to 2021. He was promoted to crew chief in 1999. Davis worked a total of 151 post season games,the most in MLB history. He umpired six World Series, eleven League Championship Series and thirteen League Division Series. He also worked in the All-Star Game four times.Davis was chosen to work a Special Event in an All Time record 24 consecutive seasons. He wore uniform number 12 throughout his career.

==Umpiring career==

Davis began umpiring in the minor leagues in 1976. He worked in the Midwest League, Eastern League and American Association before being promoted to the majors in 1982.

He has officiated in 22 postseasons, including the World Series in 1996, 1999, 2004, 2009 2012 and 2017, the League Championship Series in 1990, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2018; the Division Series in 1996, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2015; and the Wild Card Game in 2013, 2014 and 2018. He also umpired the All-Star Game in 1989, 1997, 2002 and 2012; he called balls and strikes on the last two occasions.

Davis opted out of the 2020 season due to concerns from the coronavirus pandemic. He umpired his last game on October 3, 2021, in St. Louis. Davis holds the record for the most postseason games officiated in MLB.

===Notable games===
Davis was the second base umpire for the perfect game pitched by Randy Johnson on May 18, 2004.

On September 19, 2008, at Tropicana Field, instant replay overturned a call on the field for the first time ever in the major leagues. A fly ball hit by Tampa Bay Rays&#x27; first baseman Carlos Peña, the umpires ruled, was interfered with by a fan sitting in the front row of the stands, when the ball hit the hands of the fan and fell back onto the field of play. After Joe Maddon requested the umpires hold a conference to discuss the play, the umpires, headed by Gerry Davis, decided to look at instant replay. Just over four minutes later, Davis returned to the field and signaled that the ball was a home run.

Davis was the home plate umpire for the last game played at Shea Stadium on September 28, 2008.

With his assignment to the 2012 World Series, Davis set an officiating record for most postseason games umpired in major league history with 115 and since then this mark has moved forward to 151 games.

On April 23, 2014, Davis ejected New York Yankees starting pitcher Michael Pineda for having pine tar on his neck.

On July 26, 2017, Davis asked Texas Rangers third baseman Adrián Beltré to move closer to the on-deck circle. After Beltré jokingly moved the on-deck batting circle, Davis ejected him.

==Business==
Davis owns a company, Gerry Davis Sports, which specializes in umpiring equipment and clothing. Gerry Davis Sports sells specially designed leg guards which give a small area at the top for the hands to rest, consistent with Davis&#x27;s unique umpiring stance. (When umpiring behind the plate, Davis bends down only about three-quarters as far as the conventional stance. He leans his back forward slightly and grabs the top of his leg guards with his extended arms.) These leg guards also eschew the normal straps with metal hooks, in favor of straps with plugs that hook into little notches.

==Personal life==
Davis was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in 2021, causing him to miss the first four months of the 2021 season.

He is married to Linda.

<doc id="1110109" wikidata="Q1195428" url="?curid=1110109" title="Jōkyū">
<text>, also called Shōkyū, was a Japanese era name (年号, &quot;nengō&quot;, lit. year name) after &quot;Kempō&quot; and before &quot;Jōō.&quot; This period spanned the years from April 1219 through April 1222. The reigning emperor was Juntoku&quot;-tennō&quot; (順徳天皇).

==Change of era==
* 1219 : The new era name was created because the previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Kempo&quot; 3, on the 6th day of the 12th month of 1219.

==Events of the &quot;Jōkyū&quot; era==
* February 12, 1219 (&quot;Jōkyū 1, 26th day of the 1st month&quot;): Shōgun Sanetomo was assassinated on the steps of Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gū in Kamakura. The 40 years during which Minamoto no Yoritomo, Minamoto no Yoriie and Minamoto no Sanetomo were successive heads of the Kamakura shogunate was sometimes called &quot;the period of the three shōguns.&quot; A new shōgun was not to be named for several years during which the Kamakura bureaucracy nevertheless continued to function without interruption.
* 1220 (&quot;Jōkyū 2, 2nd month&quot;): The emperor visited the Iwashimizu Shrine and the Kamo Shrines.
* May 13, 1221 (&quot;Jōkyū 3, 20th day of the 4th month&quot;): In the 11th year of Juntoku&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (順徳天皇11年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by eldest son who was only 4 years old. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Chūkyō is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;). The reign of Emperor Chūkyō spans a small number of months.
* July 29, 1221 (&quot;Jōkyū 3, 9th day of the 7th month&quot;): In the 1st year of what is now considered to have been Chūkyō&quot;-tennō&quot;″s reign (仲恭天皇1年), he abruptly abdicated without designating an heir; and contemporary scholars then construed that the succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by a grandson of former Emperor Go-Toba.
* 1221 (&quot;Jōkyū 3&quot;): The Jōkyū War (&quot;Jōkyū no ran&quot;) was an armed attempt by Emperor Go-Toba and his supporters, trying unsuccessfully to take power from the Kamakura bakufu.
* January 14, 1222 (&quot;Jōkyū 3, 1st day of the 12th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Horikawa acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).

It would be the last album to be released during Croce&#x27;s lifetime.

==Production==
The album was produced by Tommy West and Terry Cashman.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The New Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; wrote: &quot;Croce&#x27;s nostalgic side began to take over and he started to produce strikingly impersonal experiments in the craft of sentiment. It fits him well.&quot;

<doc id="1110114" wikidata="Q934433" url="?curid=1110114" title="Demobilization">
<text>Demobilization or demobilisation (see spelling differences) is the process of standing down a nation&#x27;s armed forces from combat-ready status. This may be as a result of victory in war, or because a crisis has been peacefully resolved and military force is no longer necessary. The opposite of demobilization is mobilization, which is the act of calling up forces for active military service. Forceful demobilization of a defeated enemy is called demilitarization.

The United Nations defines demobilization as &quot;a multifaceted process that officially certifies an individual&#x27;s change of status from being a member of a military grouping of some kind to being a civilian&quot;. Persons undergoing demobilization are removed from the command and control of their armed force and group and the transformation from a military mindset to that of a civilian begins. Although combatants become civilians when they acquire their official discharge documents the mental connection and formal ties to their military command structure still exist. To prevent soldiers from rejoining their armed groups, important preparatory work must be done to ensure that combatants are ready to be reintegrated into society and capable of returning to their civilian lives. Civilians play an important role in supporting combatants to return to civilian life by exposing them to civilian lifestyles and mindsets that combat the rigid military mindset soldiers acquire during their time of service.

Demobilization can be partial or complete depending on the number of units removed from the command structure. The process is often a symbolic and significant part of the peace process during which the conflicting sides acknowledge their intent to consolidate peace.

The United Nations identifies demobilization as part of a three-pronged approach to conflict management. This includes disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration to take combatants out of conflict situations as well as remove weapons and help former members of armed groups rejoin society.

In the final days of World War II, for example, the United States Armed Forces developed a demobilization plan which would discharge soldiers on the basis of a point system that favored length and certain types of service. The British armed forces were demobilized according to an &quot;age-and-service&quot; scheme.

The phrase &quot;demob happy&quot; refers to demobilization and is broadly applied to the feeling of relief at imminent release from a time-serving burden, such as a career. In the Russian language, it is known as &quot;dembel&quot; and has become a certain tradition in the Soviet and post-Soviet Armed Forces. A United States equivalent is &quot;short-timer&#x27;s disease&quot;, comparable to &quot;senioritis&quot; among United States high school students.

== Two approaches to demobilization ==
The United Nations Peacekeeping Operational Manual lists two different approaches to demobilization. These approaches are the semi-permanent demobilization sites (cantonment) or the mobile method which means demobilization at the sites where ex-combatants are gathered. 

==Other uses==

In professional diving, demobilization is the dismantling, packing and transport back to storage of the diving spread, and where relevant, restoring the site to initial condition. Mobilization is the converse process.

<text>Lizzie Borden (born Linda Elizabeth Borden in 1950; some sources say 1958) is an American filmmaker, best known for her early independent films &quot;Born in Flames&quot; (1983) and &quot;Working Girls&quot; (1986).

==Early life and career==
The daughter of a Detroit stockbroker, she was originally named Linda Elizabeth Borden. At the age of eleven she decided to take the name of the infamous accused double murderer Lizzie Borden, the inspiration for the children&#x27;s rhyme, &quot;Lizzie Borden took an axe/And gave her father forty whacks,/When she saw what she had done,/She gave her mother forty-one.&quot; Of her announcement to her parents that she was legally changing her name, Borden says, &quot;At the time, my name was the best rebellion I could make.&quot;

Borden majored in fine arts at Wellesley College in Massachusetts before moving to New York City, and began her career as a writer, art critic (with several articles and reviews for &quot;Artforum&quot; from 1972 to 1974) and painter. After attending a retrospective of the films of Jean-Luc Godard, she was inspired to become a filmmaker and to experiment with cinema, favoring a &quot;naive&quot; approach to film production.

Borden made an experimental documentary film in 1976, &quot;Regrouping&quot;, which chronicled the fracturing of a women&#x27;s collective. The film&#x27;s portrait of four women artists incorporated avant-garde techniques borrowed from performance art, including a meta-analysis of the role of film itself in the fracturing of the collective that the film portrayed.

==Independent film career==
Borden&#x27;s films have been said to be united by an &quot;iconoclastic depiction of sex&quot;—notably, she controversially portrayed prostitution as an &quot;economic choice&quot; in her 1986 film &quot;Working Girls&quot;. Her body of work also investigates race, class, power, capitalism, and the power that money bestows—all from a feminist viewpoint.

Borden&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Born in Flames&quot;, was shot and edited over five years with a budget of $30,000, and completed in 1983. Set in a near-future New York City, the film explores the role media plays in culture. What began as a project about white feminist responses to an oppressive government evolved into a story about women of color, lesbians, and white women of various classes mobilizing into collective action. The film concerned the racial, class, and political conflicts in a future United States socialist democracy. The film is named for a song written by Mayo Thompson of the Red Krayola, a member of the artists&#x27; group Art &amp; Language. Borden used nonprofessional actors and the film was produced in a gritty, pseudo-documentary style. One reviewer noted that it pieces together a &quot;disjunctive collage of women&#x27;s individual and collective work.&quot; &quot;Born in Flames&quot; premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and has won several awards. It was named one of &quot;The Most Important 50 Independent Films&quot; by &quot;Filmmaker&quot; magazine and has been the subject of extensive feminist analysis, including that of Teresa de Lauretis.

Borden&#x27;s next film, &quot;Working Girls&quot;, depicted the lives of sex workers and maintains some of the stylistic and thematic features of her debut, but is more mainstream in its approach. The film was inspired by some of the women who participated in the making of &quot;Born in Flames&quot;, who coincidentally supported themselves through prostitution. Although &quot;Working Girls&quot; addresses the subject of prostitution in great detail, Borden prefers the film to be discussed as a narrative fiction film rather than as a documentary. The film was intended to be a &quot;backstage&quot; look at prostitution. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; review, Vincent Canby writes, &quot;&quot;Working Girls&quot;, though a work of fiction, sounds as authentic as might a documentary about coal miners.&quot; The film portrays prostitution as an often tedious, sometimes depressing, occasionally interesting or funny job. The main character, Molly (portrayed by Louise Smith), claims to have a degree from Yale and is a lesbian in her private life.

Borden wrote, directed and produced the film, which premiered in May 1986 at the 39th Cannes Film Festival after being selected for the Directors&#x27; Fortnight. The following January, the film debuted at the 1987 Sundance Film Festival where it won a Special Jury Prize and was picked up for distribution by Miramax Films.

==Hollywood film career==
Miramax gave Borden a budget of $6 million and a script for &quot;Love Crimes&quot;, her first Hollywood feature (and her first film based on another writer&#x27;s script). It was intended as an erotic thriller, but Borden envisioned it as centered more on a woman&#x27;s genuine sexual feelings. The original script by Allan Moyle was rewritten by Laurie Frank, a female screenwriter specifically requested by Borden. The film starred Sean Young and Patrick Bergin.

&quot;Love Crimes&quot; was subjected to much studio interference and it fell victim to Hollywood attitudes regarding sex on screen in the 1990s; as a result, it lacked the taboo representations she had previously been able to show in her work. Numerous scenes were removed and some never shot, in the studio&#x27;s attempts to present what they termed an &quot;acceptable&quot; vision of the lead&#x27;s sexuality to a mass audience. While Borden found herself in the position to direct a mainstream production, she said her power over the film&#x27;s content was disrupted by (as she put it) &quot;everyone else&#x27;s psyches ... with their fetishes, and what they don&#x27;t like.&quot; 
The studio took away much of Borden&#x27;s control over the final product and even went so far as to cut out the original ending that Borden had shot, substituting its own. &quot;I went to movie jail after I did this awful movie, &quot;Love Crimes&quot;. I should have taken my name off it, but I was bullied into not taking my name off it. There are things in it that I didn&#x27;t shoot. It&#x27;s just not my movie, really.&quot;

&quot;Love Crimes&quot; was released in theaters on January 24, 1992, and quickly tanked – it was pulled from release after three weeks due to poor box office. It recouped less than half of its budget.
For its VHS release, Borden negotiated the restoration of several scenes originally cut from the theatrical release. As a result, two versions of the film were released on video in July 1992: the original 84-minute theatrical version and a second, &quot;unrated&quot; version at 91 minutes. &quot;The problems really came down to sex,&quot; Borden said. &quot;My vision of what I wanted, of how I wanted to explore the character (played by Sean Young) and her sexual needs and desires just wasn&#x27;t acceptable or accepted. The sadomasochistic element of the film as I envisioned it was too scary for the people writing the checks. And then I didn&#x27;t get the final cut.&quot; The VHS release of the film&#x27;s unrated version became a fast seller and it remains a cult favorite and highly collectible. In 2018, Borden disowned the &quot;director&#x27;s cut&quot; label as a misnomer, and a marketing ploy by the studio and Harvey Weinstein, who she later said &quot;threatened to destroy my career.&quot;

After the critical and box office failure of &quot;Love Crimes&quot;, Borden suspected that Weinstein branded her as &quot;difficult.&quot; As a result, she ran into difficulty setting up further film projects. She ventured into television with mixed results, and worked with such cult stars as Mary Woronov, Alexis Arquette and Joe Dallesandro in a series Propaganda Films had created for Playboy TV (other directors in the series included Bernard Rose and Alexander Payne.) She subsequently directed episodes of &quot;Red Shoe Diaries&quot;, &quot;The Secret World of Alex Mack&quot; and other television productions, as well as directing local theater in Hollywood with the Grace Players, a theater troupe led by Natalija Nogulich.

Borden was one of four directors involved in the 1995 sex-vignette anthology film &quot;Erotique&quot;; and she cast a not-yet-famous Bryan Cranston for her segment. &quot;Besides Louise Smith, he was the most game, daring actor I&#x27;ve ever worked with,&quot; she said.

In 1999, Borden was able to pitch to investors a filmed version of August Strindberg&#x27;s 1888 play &quot;Miss Julie&quot; and was in pre-production when director Mike Figgis announced his own version in the trades, and her bank financing collapsed.

In 2001, Borden flew to New York City for final script discussions with actress Susan Sarandon for her next film project, &quot;Rialto&quot;. She and her partners arrived on the morning of 9/11, just in time to witness the World Trade Center collapse. Sarandon immediately joined the relief effort at Ground Zero and the project was put on hold.

Since the mid-2000s, Borden has been working as a script doctor in Los Angeles, writing scripts for other directors including one about reggae singer Bob Marley&#x27;s relationship with mobster Danny Sims (based on Rita Marley&#x27;s autobiography &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;). That project was called &quot;Rebels&quot; and was announced in 2015 as part of slate of projects by Golden Island Filmworks to begin shooting in 2016. She has worked on some pilots for Fox Television, wrote a play about singer Nina Simone, and continues to solicit financing for her independent projects.

== Writing ==
Her other works in progress have included editing a book of stories by strippers, &quot;Honey On A Razor&quot;, and collaborating on a series about strippers with Antonia Crane, author of the memoir &quot;Spent&quot;. On December 6, 2022, Seven Stories Press published an anthology of stories by strippers Borden edited over a period of twenty years, &quot;Whorephobia&quot;, reviewed in Publishers Weekly as &quot;a humane, multidimensional portrait of an industry typically shrouded in artifice and shame.&quot;

==Legacy==
In February 2016, Anthology Film Archives hosted a week-long revival run of &quot;Born in Flames&quot; to premiere Anthology&#x27;s new 35mm restoration of the work, funded by The Film Foundation and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. The restoration was part of a larger multi-year project, &quot;Re-Visions: American Experimental Film 1975–1990,&quot; supported by The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. To commemorate the re-release, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; remarked, &quot;the free, ardent, spontaneous creativity of &#x27;Born in Flames&#x27; emerges as an indispensable mode of radical change — one that many contemporary filmmakers with political intentions have yet to assimilate.&quot;

The restored and remastered 35mm print of &quot;Born In Flames&quot; that debuted at the Anthology Film Archives in February 2016 enjoyed something of a second life, traveling to the Walker Art Center, the Toronto Film Festival, the 2017 London Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival and the Seoul International Women&#x27;s Film Festival,; as well as screening in Brussels, Barcelona, Madrid, and San Sebastian; and in many US cities including Detroit, Rochester, San Francisco and New Orleans. Her first film, &quot;Regrouping&quot;, was also shown at the screenings in Spain and in Brussels, and at the Edinburgh Film Festival, where it first played.

&quot;Born In Flames&quot; was featured at the fourth annual Final Girls Berlin film festival in 2019; the festival features horror by women directors and presented Borden&#x27;s dystopian film as part of a sci-fi showcase. The film was also broadcast on Turner Classic Movies on the night of November 3, 2020, along with Borden&#x27;s commentary on her film and on several other films featured in Mark Cousins&#x27; documentary, &quot;Women Make Film&quot;. The Bronx Museum of the Arts featured &quot;Born in Flames&quot; as the title piece of an exhibition about feminism and futurity from April to September 2021.

Borden&#x27;s early films continue to be shown singly and in retrospectives at film festivals, repertory cinemas and art venues worldwide. &quot;Regrouping&quot; was restored by The Anthology Film Archives for a 2021 release and is part of Borden&#x27;s early catalog acquired by Criterion. The Criterion Channel has shown &quot;Born In Flames&quot; and an interview with Borden; and The Criterion Collection restored and released &quot;Working Girls&quot; on DVD and Blu-Ray in 2021.

On the fate of her Hollywood films, Borden has said, &quot;&quot;Born in Flames&quot; and &quot;Working Girls&quot; are the only two films I consider my own. The others – especially &quot;Love Crimes&quot; and &quot;Erotique&quot; – were so radically re-cut and interfered with by producers, they&#x27;re not &#x27;mine&#x27;, in any sense of the word.&quot; (Flashbacks by L.M. &quot;Kit&quot; Carson were added to &quot;Love Crimes&quot;, and Borden was threatened against taking her name off the film. The producer of &quot;Erotique&quot; re-edited the film and laid on a music track, among other changes.) &quot;I would like to make films the way I used to in New York, if that is possible. If I am able to make &quot;Rialto&quot; in ten years – or twenty – I hope it will still be relevant. I don&#x27;t need to make a lot of films, I just need to believe in the ones I make. I would prefer to remain silent in the sense of the Susan Sontag essay (&quot;The Aesthetics of Silence&quot;) until I am able to make something I believe in. And the issues I believe in – social issues, feminist issues, radical issues – are difficult to finance, even independently.&quot;
In 2021, Borden was invited to become a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

<text>Laurence Hirsch Silberman (October 12, 1935 – October 2, 2022) was an American jurist and diplomat who served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1985 until his death. He was appointed in October 1985 by President Ronald Reagan and took senior status on November 1, 2000. On June 11, 2008, President George W. Bush awarded Silberman the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life and education==
Silberman was born in 1935 to a Jewish family in York, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Dartmouth College with a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1957. After serving six months of active duty in the US Army (five-and-a-half years in reserve), he attended Harvard Law School and graduated in 1961 with a Bachelor of Laws degree.

==Career==
Silberman worked as a partner at the law firms Moore, Silberman &amp; Schulze in Honolulu and Morrison &amp; Foerster and Steptoe &amp; Johnson in Washington, D.C. He also served as Executive Vice President of Crocker National Bank in San Francisco. He also worked as an attorney in the National Labor Relations Board&#x27;s appellate section, as Solicitor of Labor from 1969 to 1970, and as Undersecretary of Labor from 1970 to 1973. As Solicitor, he was largely responsible for developing the requirement of goals and timetables as an enforcement device for the affirmative action order. He subsequently regretted his stance and wrote, &quot;Our use of numerical standards in pursuit of equal opportunity has led to the very quotas guaranteeing equal results that we initially wished to avoid.&quot;

He also led the development of legislation to implement &quot;final offer selection&quot; as a means of resolving labor disputes. As Undersecretary, he repeatedly clashed with Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Colson and tendered his resignation to compel the hiring of a black regional director in New York in 1972.

President Richard Nixon nominated Silberman to be Deputy Attorney General of the United States in January 1974. Silberman was tasked with reviewing J. Edgar Hoover&#x27;s secret files, which he described as &quot;the single worst experience of my long governmental service.&quot; Silberman stated that &quot;this country – and the Federal Bureau of Investigation – would be well served if [Hoover&#x27;s] name were removed from the bureau&#x27;s building. It is as if the Defense Department were named for Aaron Burr. Liberals and conservatives should unite to support legislation to accomplish this repudiation of a very sad chapter in American history.&quot; Silberman also served briefly as Acting Attorney General during the Watergate crisis. Silberman&#x27;s resignation was accepted by President Gerald Ford, pending the confirmation of his successor.

Ford nominated Silberman as ambassador to Yugoslavia in April 1975. He served in the role until he resigned during the presidential transition of Jimmy Carter. At the same time, Silberman also served as the Presidential Special Envoy for International Labor Organization Affairs. As ambassador, he succeeded in freeing an American who had been falsely imprisoned by the regime as a CIA agent, by putting pressure on both the Yugoslav regime and the State Department. During the campaign for the 1980 presidential election, he was co-chairman of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s foreign policy advisors. From 1981 to 1985, he served as a member of the General Advisory Committee on Arms Control and Disarmament and the Defense Policy Board.

In total, Silberman has held six Senate-confirmed positions and never received a dissenting vote.

===Federal judicial service===
Silberman was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on September 11, 1985, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to a new seat created by 98 Stat. 333. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on October 25, 1985, and received commission on October 28, 1985. He assumed senior status on November 1, 2000.
Silberman was on the short list of potential nominees to the U.S. Supreme Court on three separate occasions in 1987, 1990, and 1991. However, after the rejection of Robert Bork with whom Silberman had served on the District of Columbia Circuit, he was regarded as controversial. Unlike fellow conservatives Pasco Bowman II and John Clifford Wallace, Silberman even drew some opposition from Republican senators because although he was a judicial conservative and thus was likely against &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; as a legal matter, he was thought to be personally pro-choice. Meanwhile, some criticized him for having an explosive temper while he was Deputy Attorney General, and at the same time, others noted that &quot;he expect[ed] people to pound the table and shout right back&quot; and uniquely possessed &quot;the interest, talent and capacity for administration.&quot; It was also reported Silberman faced criticism over legal issues arising from his time at Crocker National Bank at which he had been executive vice-president between 1979 and 1983, but that appears to have been pretextual given the FBI had cleared him of any wrongdoing and he had since been confirmed to the D.C. Circuit unanimously. He was a member of the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review at the time of its first ever session in 2002.

On February 6, 2004, Silberman was appointed co-chairman of the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent blue-ribbon panel created to investigate U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. In the wake of the resignation of Alberto Gonzales as United States Attorney General in 2007, Silberman was mentioned as a possible successor.

In 2008, Silberman, joined by five other senior judges, initiated a suit against the United States, &quot;claiming that when Congress refused to authorize statutory cost-of-living raises for federal judges, it violated the Compensation Clause [of the Constitution]&quot;. The Federal Judges Association opposed bringing the suit. The suit was ultimately successful, leading to a nationwide rise in pay for all federal judges as of January 1, 2014.

In 2015, Silberman wrote an op-ed in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, writing that the charge that &quot;President Bush deceived the American people about the threat from Saddam&quot; reminded him of &quot;a similarly baseless accusation that helped the Nazis come to power in Germany.&quot;

In June 2020, Silberman circulated an email criticizing an amendment by Senator Elizabeth Warren to rename Confederate military bases. He characterized the effort as &quot;madness&quot; and &quot;the desecration of Confederate graves&quot;. An African American law clerk replied, pointing out the Confederate legacy of slavery and Silberman’s inconsistency, given his prior advocacy to rename FBI headquarters. The amendment was ultimately included in the final version of the NDAA 2021

In October 2021, Silberman won the first annual Justice Clarence Thomas First Principles Award for his judicial service. The Wall Street Journal editorial board called him &quot;one of the all-time giants of the federal bench&quot; and perhaps &quot;the most influential judge never to have sat on the Supreme Court.&quot;

===Yale Law School protest===
On March 17, 2022, several news outlets published an email that Silberman had sent to all Article III federal judges regarding a protest at Yale Law School. In the email, Silberman suggested that students who disrupted a Federalist Society event by shouting down a speaker should be barred from consideration for potential clerkships because they clearly do not respect free speech principles. The panel discussion, which focused on remedies for First Amendment violations, featured Monica Miller, the legal director of the American Humanist Association, and Kristen Waggoner, general counsel for Alliance Defending Freedom. Silberman&#x27;s characterization of the event was criticized by some and praised by others.

===Legal opinions===

As a judge, Silberman authored a number of noteworthy opinions:
* In &quot;In re Sealed Case&quot;, 838 F.2d 476 (1988), Silberman held that the procedures for appointing independent counsels violated the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution and the separation of powers, because they interfered with the President&#x27;s ability to ensure that the laws are &quot;faithfully executed&quot;. This decision was subsequently reversed by the Supreme Court in &quot;Morrison v. Olson&quot;, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), over a vigorous dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia.
* In a later &quot;per curiam&quot; decision captioned &quot;In re: Sealed Case No. 02-001&quot;, 310 F.3d 717 (2002), the court upheld a provision of the Patriot Act that made it easier for law enforcement officers and intelligence officers to share information with each other. This was an important decision involving interpretation of the Patriot Act, the use of foreign intelligence, and the role of the FISA Court. Silberman subsequently disclosed that he had in fact written the opinion.
* In &quot;Parker v. District of Columbia&quot;, 478 F.3d 370 (2007), Silberman held that the District of Columbia&#x27;s flat ban on the registration and carrying of firearms violated the Second Amendment right &quot;to keep and bear arms&quot;. The case was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in &quot;District of Columbia v. Heller&quot;, 554 U.S. 570 (2008).
* In &quot;Seven-Sky v. Holder&quot;, 661 F.3d 1 (2011), Silberman authored an opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act as a constitutional exercise of the Commerce Power, on the grounds that individuals&#x27; decisions to remain uninsured, in the aggregate, have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. At the time, a number of commentators viewed Judge Silberman&#x27;s opinion as an important bellwether of how the Supreme Court might decide the case. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected Judge Silberman&#x27;s reasoning in &quot;National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius&quot;, 132 S. Ct. 2566 (2012), by a vote of 5 to 4, upholding the Affordable Care Act instead as an exercise of the taxing power. Some commentators praised Silberman, a Reagan appointee, for his &quot;judicial restraint&quot; in upholding the signature statute of a Democratic administration. Writing in &quot;Slate&quot;, Simon Lazarus described Silberman as a &quot;conservative icon&quot; and noted that &quot;despite intense short-term political pressures and long-term ideological stakes, leading conservative jurists appear likely to stick to their traditional judicial restraint canon when deciding the fate of the Affordable Care Act&quot;.
* Dissenting vigorously in &quot;Tah v. Global Witness Publishing, Inc.&quot; Silberman called on the Supreme Court to overturn &quot;New York Times v. Sullivan&quot;, and claimed that &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; are &quot;virtually Democratic Party broadsheets,&quot; and labeled &quot;[n]early all television—network and cable—a Democratic Party trumpet.&quot; His dissent also accused big tech companies of censoring conservatives and warned that &quot;Democratic Party ideological control&quot; of the media may be a prelude to an &quot;authoritarian or dictatorial regime&quot; that constitutes &quot;a threat to a viable democracy&quot;.

===Academic career===

Silberman was a lecturer at the University of Hawaiʻi from 1962 to 1963. He was an adjunct professor of Administrative Law at Georgetown University Law Center from 1987 to 1994 and from 1997 to 1999, at NYU from 1995 to 1996, and at Harvard in 1998. He held the position of Distinguished Visitor from the Judiciary at Georgetown University Law Center from 2000 to 2019 and taught both administrative law and labor law. Silberman received the Charles Fahy Distinguished Adjunct Professor Award for the 2002–2003 academic year. He has also received a Lifetime Service Award (2006) and a Distinguished Service Award (2007) from the Federalist Society chapters of Georgetown and Harvard, respectively.

==Criticism==
=== &quot;October Surprise&quot; ===
Some commentators have speculated that Silberman may have been involved in the so-called &quot;October Surprise&quot; with respect to the Iran hostage crisis prior to the 1980 presidential election, alleging that Silberman and others had attended meetings to negotiate the delayed release of the hostages by the Iranian government.

Silberman publicly responded as follows to the allegations:

On January 3, 1993, the bipartisan Joint Report of the Task Force to Investigate Certain Allegations Concerning the Holding of American Hostages by Iran in 1980, also known as the &quot;October Surprise Task Force,&quot; was released. The Task Force, led by Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D) and Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R), specifically concluded that &quot;there is wholly insufficient evidence of any communications by or on behalf of the 1980 Reagan Presidential campaign with any persons representing or connected with the Iranian government or with those holding Americans as hostages during the 1979-1981 period&quot; and that &quot;there is no credible evidence supporting any attempt or proposal to attempt, by the Reagan Presidential Campaign – or persons representing or associated with the campaign – to delay the release of the American hostages in Iran.&quot;

=== Iran–Contra affair ===
Silberman served on a panel of the D.C. Circuit in &quot;U.S. vs. Oliver L. North&quot;, 910 F.2d 843 (1990), in which a &quot;per curiam&quot; opinion was issued that overturned the conviction of Oliver North, who had been a key figure in perpetrating the Iran–Contra affair.

In his memoir, &quot;Firewall&quot;, published seven years after the case in 1997, Lawrence Walsh, the Independent Counsel appointed by President Reagan to investigate the Iran Contra Affair, he mused that in retrospect, he wished that he had moved for Silberman&#x27;s recusal from the panel:

Silberman also observed that David Brock, latterly a Silberman critic (see below), published a refutation of Lawrence Walsh&#x27;s characterization of Judge Silberman&#x27;s involvement in the North case:

==Personal life and death==
Silberman&#x27;s first wife, Rosalie &quot;Ricky&quot; Gaull Silberman, co-founder of the Independent Women&#x27;s Forum, died on February 17, 2007. Together, they had three children, Robert S. Silberman, Kate Fischer, and Anne Otis. His eight grandchildren include the screenwriter and film producer Katie Silberman. Silberman married Patricia Winn Silberman in 2008. 

Silberman was a close friend of Justice Antonin Scalia since he had recruited Scalia into the Ford administration. Silberman was also a friend of Justice Clarence Thomas and in 1989 encouraged a young and reluctant Thomas to accept a federal judgeship on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Several of his former law clerks have become federal judges, including Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Silberman died on October 2, 2022, ten days before his 87th birthday.

<doc id="1110145" wikidata="Q7609172" url="?curid=1110145" title="Stephen F. Williams">
<text>Stephen Fain Williams (September 23, 1936 – August 7, 2020) was an American lawyer and jurist who was a U.S. circuit judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1986 until his death from COVID-19 in 2020.

==Early life and career==
Williams was born in 1936 in New York City. His father, C. Dickerman Williams, was a prominent lawyer who later became the general counsel of the United States Department of Commerce. Williams graduated from Yale University in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;, where he was a member of the Manuscript Society. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was classmates with future federal judges Anthony Kennedy, Laurence Silberman, A. Wallace Tashima, R. Lanier Anderson III, and Timothy B. Dyk. He was a member of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and graduated in 1961 with a Juris Doctor, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. 

Williams was in the United States Army Reserve as a Private E-2 from 1961 to 1962. He was in private practice at the law firm Debevoise &amp; Plimpton from 1962 to 1966, and from 1966 to 1969 he was an Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. From 1969 to his appointment to the bench, he taught at the University of Colorado School of Law. During this time, he also served as a visiting professor of law at UCLA, University of Chicago Law School, and Southern Methodist University and he was a consultant to the Administrative Conference of the United States and the Federal Trade Commission.

==Federal judicial service==
Williams was nominated by President Ronald Reagan on February 19, 1986, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated by Judge Malcolm R. Wilkey. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 13, 1986, and received commission on June 16, 1986. He assumed senior status on September 30, 2001.

In March 2017, Williams questioned if the government could constitutionally keep all prisoner court filings secret when the court, unanimous in judgment but in divided opinions, found that the press could not access classified video of Jihad Ahmed Mustafa Dhiab being force fed during the Guantanamo Bay hunger strikes.

==Death==
Williams was diagnosed with COVID-19 in May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Washington, D.C. He was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital and put on a ventilator. On August 7, 2020, after about two months in the hospital, he died from complications as a result of the virus.

==Author==
Williams was the author of numerous books and scholarly articles. His book, &quot;Liberal Reform in an Illiberal Regime, 1906–1915: The Creation of Private Property in Russia&quot;, was described by former acting Prime Minister of Russia Yegor Gaidar as &quot;absolutely splendid&quot;.

<doc id="1110151" wikidata="Q464467" url="?curid=1110151" title="David Weir (Scottish footballer)">
<text>David Gillespie Weir (born 10 May 1970) is a Scottish football coach and former professional player who is the technical director of Premier League club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

Born in Falkirk, Weir played as a defender, and began his professional career with his home-town club, Falkirk, after having attended the University of Evansville in the United States. After four seasons with the Bairns, Weir then moved on to Heart of Midlothian where he won the 1998 Scottish Cup. He joined Everton in 1999 and spent seven years with the club, becoming club captain under two different managers. Weir then moved to Rangers in 2007 and became club captain after Barry Ferguson was stripped of the role in April 2009. Weir called time on his playing career in May 2012.

Weir won his first cap for the Scotland national team in 1997 and was selected for their 1998 FIFA World Cup squad. He retired from international football in 2002, when Berti Vogts was the manager, but returned when Walter Smith took charge in 2004. Weir became the oldest Scotland player when he played in UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying matches in 2010, and he finished his international career with 69 caps.

Weir had a brief spell as manager of Sheffield United in 2013. He has since assisted Mark Warburton at Brentford, Rangers and Nottingham Forest.

==Club career==
===Evansville Purple Aces===
Weir was scouted by the University of Evansville. He moved to the United States on a scholarship from 1988 to 1991. Weir excelled in this position, scoring 28 goals in 27 matches during his senior year. This form led to him being named an NCAA All-American and Midwest Collegiate Conference Player of the Year in 1990. Weir is tied for the school record with 50 career goals and ranks second in school history with 129 career points.

He was the first former collegiate player to represent a European nation at the FIFA World Cup in 1998.

===Falkirk===
In 1992, he joined then Scottish First Division side Falkirk and went on to make 134 appearances for the club and score eight goals. He was part of the side which won promotion to the Scottish Premier Division. Weir also won the 1993 Scottish Challenge Cup on 12 December, playing in the side that defeated St Mirren 3–0 at Fir Park in Motherwell.

===Heart of Midlothian===
On 30 June 1996, Weir moved to Premier Division side Heart of Midlothian. He made his debut for the club in a League Cup match against Stenhousemuir on 14 August 1996 and scored his first goal three days later. Weir netted Hearts second goal in a 3–2 win over Kilmarnock. His first sending off was in an infamous game against Rangers at Ibrox on 14 September 1996. Rangers won the match 3–0 but Hearts had four players ordered off in a twenty-minute spell.

Weir won his second career honour, the 1998 Scottish Cup, by beating Rangers 2–1 in the final at Celtic Park. He left Tynecastle midway through the following season when he was purchased by Everton for £250,000. Weir played 116 games in all for Hearts and scored twelve goals.

===Everton===
Weir joined Everton on 16 February 1999 and made his debut in a league match against Middlesbrough the next day as Everton won, 5–0, coming on as a substitute for John Oster after 73 minutes. Weir&#x27;s first goal for Everton was a last-minute equaliser against Leeds United in a 4–4 draw in October 1999, however the following week he picked up his first red card for Everton in another game against Middlesbrough. At the end of the 2001–02 season, Weir was voted Everton&#x27;s Player of the Year by &#x27;s readers, with Weir the only player to reach four figures in terms of votes. In the Merseyside derby match on 19 April 2003, Weir received a red card as Everton lost 2–1 and played with 9 men after Gary Naysmith was also sent off.

He had a very successful time with the Merseyside club, playing regularly for eight years, making 269 appearances (scoring 10 goals in the process), playing in European competition, becoming club captain under two different managers – Walter Smith and David Moyes – and winning the bulk of his Scotland caps on the strength of his performances for the Toffees. During the 2005–06 season, his side played in UEFA Champions League but lost 4–2 on aggregate to Spanish side Villarreal CF in the third qualifying round. After being eliminated in the Champions League, Everton played in the UEFA Cup but lost again, this time to Romanian side Dinamo București 5–2 on aggregate in the first round of UEFA Cup.

===Rangers===
On 16 January 2007, Weir signed for Rangers on an initial six-month deal after Everton released him from his contract early. He teamed up again with former manager Walter Smith. He made his Rangers debut against Dunfermline Athletic on 21 January 2007.
His performances for the Glasgow club were enough to secure a one-year contract. After his man-of-the-match performance against St Mirren on 8 April 2007, he revealed that he may remain at Rangers for the 2007–08 season after discussing the issue with his family. His agent met with Rangers on 19 April to discuss a possible extension to his contract, which was due to expire at the end of that season. Weir signed a one-year extension to his deal, keeping him at Rangers until the summer of 2008.

He scored his first Rangers goal against FK Zeta in a UEFA Champions League qualifier, on 31 July 2007. Weir was highly praised for his endurance during the 2007–08 season as Rangers chased The Quadruple. Despite being in his late 30s, he managed sixty appearances that season and produced some outstanding performances alongside Carlos Cuéllar in the centre of defence. Weir won his third and fourth trophies of his career in 2008, as Rangers claimed Scottish Cup and League Cup glory. On 3 July he signed a further one-year contract extension to his deal. He was appointed Rangers&#x27; captain on 3 April 2009 after Barry Ferguson had been stripped the role following an incident whilst on international duty. Weir won the League and Cup double in season 2008–09 with Rangers and signed a further one-year contract extension which saw playing into his forties. In March 2010, Weir won the Player of the month award for February and followed this up with the Clydesdale Bank Premier League Player of the Year award for the 2009–10 season. On 7 May 2010 it was announced Weir had also won the Scottish Football Writers&#x27; Association Footballer of the Year Award, the oldest player ever to receive this accolade – just three days before his 40th birthday. Soon afterwards, Weir agreed another one-year contract which saw him play on into his forties. He became the third oldest player ever to compete in the UEFA Champions League on 14 September 2010 in Rangers&#x27; 0–0 away draw with Manchester United at Old Trafford and he became the joint oldest outfield player in Champions League history when he played against Bursaspor in December 2010, aged 40 years 211 days. Weir captured his third league title with Rangers as captain on the week of his 41st birthday when Rangers defeated Kilmarnock 5–1 on the last day of the season beating Celtic to the title by a single point.

On 26 May 2011, it was announced that Weir was to be inducted into the Rangers F.C. Hall of Fame. He has become the first ever player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame whilst under contract at the club. On 17 July 2011, Weir signed a new one-year deal with Rangers. Following Walter Smith&#x27;s retirement as manager, Ally McCoist succeeded him. Under McCoist, Weir did not play in the League, and he was replaced as captain by Steven Davis. Weir made his last appearance in the Champions&#x27; League Third qualifying round 1st leg against Swedish side Malmö FF. Weir played for 29 minutes, before being replaced by Juan Manuel Ortiz.

On 17 January 2012, he announced that he would be leaving Rangers in order to continue his career at an unnamed club in England. The club he was close to signing for was Sheffield United and he trained with the Blades for several weeks, however he moved into coaching instead.

== International career ==
Weir earned his first cap for Scotland in a 1–0 defeat to Wales on 27 May 1997. He scored his one and only goal for Scotland in a World Cup qualifier against Latvia at Hampden Park on 6 October 2001.

Weir temporarily retired from international football in 2002 after his performance in a UEFA Euro 2004 qualifying match against the Faroe Islands was criticised by manager Berti Vogts. He returned to international football when Walter Smith was appointed Scotland manager in December 2004.

Weir became a member of the Scotland national football team roll of honour when he won his 50th Scotland cap. This milestone came in a match against Lithuania on 6 September 2006, in which he captained his country to a 2–1 win. He captained Scotland four times.

On 24 August 2010, Weir was recalled to the Scotland squad at the age of 40 for the Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Lithuania and Liechtenstein in September 2010. Weir became the oldest ever Scottish football international when he played against Lithuania on 3 September 2010, aged 40 years and 116 days, breaking Jim Leighton&#x27;s previous record of 40 years and 78 days. This record was surpassed on 7 June 2024 by Craig Gordon.

==Coaching and managerial career==
===Everton coach===
In February 2012, Weir returned to Everton in a coaching capacity with the club&#x27;s academy and reserve teams. He made his reserve-team debut for the club against Liverpool on the day of his return. When manager David Moyes left the club to replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United in May 2013, Weir was interviewed by Bill Kenwright for the vacant role at Everton, but the job instead went to Roberto Martínez.

===Sheffield United manager===
In June 2013, Weir signed a three-year deal to manage League One side Sheffield United. Despite winning his first competitive game in charge, a 2–1 victory over Notts County, United struggled under his management and failed to win any of their following twelve matches, leading to growing pressure from the club&#x27;s fans for Weir to be sacked. After United were beaten at home by League Two side Hartlepool United, eliminating them from the Football League Trophy, Weir was sacked on 11 October 2013.

===Assistant to Mark Warburton===
Following the departure of caretaker Alan Kernaghan, Weir was appointed as Mark Warburton&#x27;s assistant manager at League One side Brentford on 16 December 2013. After a successful season which saw Brentford promoted to the Championship, Weir signed a new one-year rolling contract to remain with the Griffin Park club. On 17 February 2015, it was announced that Weir, Warburton and Sporting Director Frank McParland would leave Brentford at the end of the 2014–15 season.

On 15 June 2015, Weir returned to Rangers on a three-year deal to assist Warburton. Weir and Warburton extended their contracts with Rangers by a further year in July 2016. In February 2017 Rangers released an official statement claiming that Weir, Warburton and head of recruitment Frank McParland had resigned their positions, effective immediately. This was denied in a joint statement by all three men, but their tenure at the club had nonetheless come to an end. Weir then assisted Warburton at Nottingham Forest, but they were sacked on 31 December 2017.

===Brighton &amp; Hove Albion===
As of April 2019, Weir was working for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion in a role in which he manages young players who are loaned out to foreign clubs.

==Personal life==
As of 2011, Weir and his wife Fiona had four children: Lucas, Jensen, Kenzie and Ruben. Lucas, Jensen and Kenzie are also footballers. Lucas and Jensen play as midfielders, while Kenzie plays as a defender. They were all born in Warrington. Lucas plays for semi-professional club 1874 Northwich. Jensen is currently at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion and has played for both Scotland and England since under-17 level. Kenzie made her senior team debut for Everton in January 2022, in the fourth round of the 2021–22 Women&#x27;s FA Cup.

<doc id="1110156" wikidata="Q1922011" url="?curid=1110156" title="Merrick Garland">
<text>Merrick Brian Garland (born November 13, 1952) is an American lawyer and jurist who served as the 86th United States attorney general from 2021 to 2025. He previously served as a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1997 to 2021. In 2016, President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the U.S. Supreme Court, but the U.S. Senate refused to hold a vote to confirm him.

A native of the Chicago area, Garland attended Harvard University and Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. He served as a law clerk to Judge Henry Friendly of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and to U.S. Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr., and then practiced corporate litigation at Arnold &amp; Porter, after which he worked as a federal prosecutor in the United States Department of Justice, where he supervised the investigation and prosecution of the Oklahoma City bombers. President Bill Clinton appointed Garland to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1997, and he served as its chief judge from 2013 to 2020.

President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Garland to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court in March 2016 to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia. However, the Republican Senate majority refused to hold a hearing or vote on his nomination. The unprecedented refusal of a Senate majority to consider a Supreme Court nomination was highly controversial. Garland&#x27;s nomination lasted 293 days (the longest to date), and it expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress. Eventually, subsequent President Donald Trump, a Republican, nominated Neil Gorsuch to the vacant seat, and the Republican Senate majority confirmed him.

President Joe Biden nominated Garland as U.S. attorney general in January 2021. He was confirmed by the Senate in a 70–30 vote, and took office in March of that same year. During his tenure, Garland was criticized for the pace of the prosecution of president Donald Trump. Some observers, including President Joe Biden, assigned Garland some responsibility for the fact that none of the indictments obtained by special counsel Jack Smith were likely to go to trial before the November 2024 election. In 2024, he was found in Contempt of Congress following the Joe Biden classified documents incident.

==Early life and education==
Garland was born on November 13, 1952, in Chicago. His mother Shirley (; 19252016) was a director of volunteer services at Chicago&#x27;s Council for Jewish Elderly (now called CJE SeniorLife). His father, Cyril Garland (1915–2000), headed Garland Advertising, a small business run out of the family home. Garland was raised in Conservative Judaism; the family name had been changed from &quot;Garfinkel&quot; several generations earlier. His grandparents left the Pale of Settlement in the western Russian Empire in the early 20th century, fleeing antisemitic pogroms in what is now Ukraine and Poland. Two of his grandmother&#x27;s siblings were later murdered in the Holocaust. He is a second cousin of Republican six-term Iowa Governor and former Ambassador to China Terry Branstad.

Garland grew up in the north Chicago border suburb of Lincolnwood. He attended Niles West High School in Skokie, Illinois, where he was president of the student council, acted in theatrical productions, and was a member of the debate team. He graduated in 1970 as the class valedictorian. Garland was also a Presidential Scholar and National Merit Scholar. He then studied social studies at Harvard University. He initially wanted to become a physician, but soon decided to become a lawyer instead. He allied himself with his future boss, Jamie Gorelick, when he was elected the only freshman member of a campus-wide committee on which Gorelick also served.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPo3/27&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During his college summers Garland volunteered as a speechwriter to Congressman Abner J. Mikva. After President Jimmy Carter appointed Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, Mikva would rely on Garland when hiring law clerks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 3/27&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At Harvard, Garland wrote news articles and theater reviews for the &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot;, and was a resident of Quincy House. Garland wrote his 235-page honors thesis on industrial mergers in Britain in the 1960s. Garland graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Garland then attended Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. Garland ran for the presidency of the &quot;Law Review&quot; but lost to Susan Estrich, so he served as an articles editor instead. As an articles editor, Garland assigned himself to edit a submission by U.S. Supreme Court justice William Brennan on the topic of the role of state constitutions in safeguarding individual rights. This correspondence with Brennan later contributed to his winning a clerkship with the justice. Garland graduated from Harvard Law School in 1977 with a Juris Doctor, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

==Early career==
After graduating from law school, Garland spent two years as a judicial law clerk, first for Judge Henry Friendly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (New York City) from 1977 to 1978 and then for Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1978 to 1979. After his clerkships, Garland spent two years as a special assistant to U.S. attorney general Benjamin Civiletti.

After the Carter administration ended in 1981, Garland entered private practice at the law firm Arnold &amp; Porter. Garland practiced mostly corporate litigation, and was made a partner in 1985. In &quot;Motor Vehicles Manufacturers Ass&#x27;n v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.&quot; (1983) Garland acted as counsel to an insurance company suing to reinstate an unpopular automatic seat belt mandate.
After winning the case in both the District of Columbia Circuit Court and the Supreme Court, Garland wrote an 87-page &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; article describing the way courts use a heightened &quot;hard look&quot; standard of review and scope of review when an agency chooses deregulation, with increasing focus on the fidelity of the agencies&#x27; actions to congressional intent.
In 1985–86, while at Arnold &amp; Porter, Garland was a lecturer at Harvard Law School, where he taught antitrust law. He also published an article in the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot; urging a broader application of antitrust immunity to state and local governments.

Desiring to return to public service and do more trial work, in 1989 Garland became an assistant United States attorney in the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of Columbia. As a line prosecutor, Garland represented the government in criminal cases ranging from drug trafficking to complex public corruption matters. Garland was one of the three principal prosecutors who handled the investigation into Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry&#x27;s possession of cocaine.

Garland then briefly returned to Arnold &amp; Porter, working there from 1992 to 1993. In 1993, Garland joined the new Clinton administration as deputy assistant attorney general in the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice. The following year, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelicka key mentor of Garland&#x27;sasked Garland to be her principal associate deputy attorney general.

In that role, Garland&#x27;s responsibilities included the supervision of high-profile domestic-terrorism cases, including the Oklahoma City bombing, Ted Kaczynski (also known as the &quot;Unabomber&quot;), and the Atlanta Olympics bombings.
Garland insisted on being sent to Oklahoma City in the aftermath of the attack, in order to examine the crime scene and oversee the investigation in preparation for the prosecution. He represented the government at the preliminary hearings of the two main defendants, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. Garland offered to lead the trial team, but could not because he was needed at the Justice Department headquarters. Instead, he helped pick the team and supervised it from Washington, D.C., where he was involved in major decisions, including the choice to seek the death penalty for McVeigh and Nichols. Garland won praise for his work on the case from the Republican governor of Oklahoma, Frank Keating.

Garland served as co-chair of the administrative law section of the District of Columbia Bar from 1991 to 1994. He is also a member of the American Law Institute.

In 2003, Garland was elected to the Harvard Board of Overseers, completing the unexpired term of Deval Patrick, who had stepped down from the board. Garland served as president of the overseers for 2009–10.

==Federal judicial service (1997–2021)==
===Appointment===

On September 6, 1995, President Bill Clinton nominated Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia seat vacated by his longtime mentor Abner J. Mikva. Justice Brennan, for whom Garland had clerked, recommended Garland for the position in a letter to Clinton. The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously gave Garland a &quot;well-qualified&quot; committee rating, its highest.

On December 1, 1995, Garland received a hearing regarding the nomination before the Senate Judiciary Committee. In Senate confirmation hearings Garland said that the Supreme Court justices whom he most admired were Justice Brennan, for whom he clerked, and Chief Justice John Marshall. Garland also expressed admiration for the writing style of Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. However, Senate Republicans did not schedule a vote on Garland&#x27;s confirmation, not because of concerns over Garland&#x27;s qualifications, but because of a dispute over whether to fill the seat.

After winning the November 1996 presidential election, Clinton renominated Garland on January 7, 1997. He was confirmed on March 19, 1997, by a 76–23 vote. The majority of Republican senators voted to confirm Garland, including senators John McCain, Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, and Jim Inhofe. Senators Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley, and Jeff Sessions were among those who voted against Garland. All of the 23 &quot;no&quot; votes came from Republicans, and all were said to be based &quot;on whether there was even a need for an eleventh seat&quot; on the D.C. Circuit. He received his judicial commission on March 20, 1997.

===Service as chief judge of the D.C. Circuit===
Garland became chief judge of the D.C. Circuit on February 12, 2013. In May 2013 he announced that the D.C. Circuit had unanimously decided to provide the public with same-day audio recordings of oral arguments in the court. During his term, he was an active member of the Judicial Conference of the United States, and was involved in the formulation of new rules to protect federal judicial branch employees from workplace harassment, which were adopted in the wake of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Alex Kozinski. Garland&#x27;s seven-year term as chief judge ended on February 11, 2020, with Judge Sri Srinivasan succeeding him. Garland continued to serve as an active member of the court until his retirement.

===Notable cases===
Garland is considered a judicial moderate and a centrist. Garland has been described by Nina Totenberg and Carrie Johnson of NPR as &quot;a moderate liberal, with a definite pro-prosecution bent in criminal cases&quot;. Tom Goldstein, the publisher of &quot;SCOTUSblog&quot;, wrote in 2010 that &quot;Judge Garland&#x27;s record demonstrates that he is essentially the model, neutral judge. His opinions avoid unnecessary, sweeping pronouncements.&quot; Garland has a reputation for collegiality and his opinions rarely draw a dissent. As of 2016, Garland had written just fifteen dissents in his two decades on the court, fewer than his colleague Brett Kavanaugh, who wrote some 17 dissents over the previous decade.

====Administrative and environmental law====
Garland has tended to favor deference to regulatory agencies. For example, in &quot;In re Aiken County&quot; (2013), Garland dissented when the court issued mandamus ordering the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to process the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository license. In &quot;Americans for Safe Access v. Drug Enforcement Administration&quot; (2013), Garland joined a divided court upholding the DEA&#x27;s classification of marijuana as a Schedule I drug. However, according to Goldstein, in a number of split decisions on environmental law Garland &quot;favored contested EPA regulations and actions when challenged by industry, and in other cases he has accepted challenges brought by environmental groups.&quot; In &quot;Rancho Viejo, LLC v. Norton&quot; (2003), Garland found the arroyo toad was protected by the federal Endangered Species Act. Circuit Judge John Roberts dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, writing that Congress&#x27;s interstate commerce power cannot reach &quot;a hapless toad that, for reasons of its own, lives its entire life in California.&quot;

====Criminal law and whistleblower protection====
While on the bench, Garland has shown a tendency to be deferential to the government in criminal cases, siding with prosecutors in ten of the fourteen criminal cases in which he disagreed with a colleague. For example, in &quot;United States v. Watson&quot; (1999), Garland dissented when the court concluded a prosecutor&#x27;s closing argument was unduly prejudicial, objecting that a conviction should be reversed for only &quot;the most egregious of these kind of errors.&quot; In 2007, Garland dissented when the en banc D.C. Circuit reversed the conviction of a Washington, D.C. police officer who had accepted bribes in an FBI sting operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPo3/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Garland has taken a broad view of whistleblower protection laws, such as the False Claims Act (FCA), which creates a private cause of action against those defrauding the federal government. For example, in &quot;United States ex rel. Yesudian v. Howard University&quot; (1998), Garland wrote for the court in holding that a plaintiff alleging he had been fired by Howard University for whistleblowing could sue under the FCA for retaliation. In &quot;United States ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp.&quot; (2004), Garland dissented when the court, in an opinion written by Judge John Roberts, held that the FCA did not apply to false claims submitted to Amtrak because Amtrak is not the government. Roberts justified his narrow reading by citing a book by circuit judge Henry Friendly. In dissent, Garland (who like Roberts had clerked for Friendly), cited Friendly&#x27;s book as supporting the use of legislative intent, writing that Roberts was relying on &quot;&#x27;canons&#x27; of statutory construction, which serve there as &#x27;cannons&#x27; of statutory destruction.&quot; Garland&#x27;s dissent, expressing concerns that the court&#x27;s ruling would impede the government&#x27;s ability to pursue false claims cases against federal grantees, is credited with sparking the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, which eliminated the loophole. During confirmation hearings in 2005, Senator Chuck Grassley sharply questioned Roberts on why he had not adopted Garland&#x27;s reading. Roberts replied, &quot;Any time Judge Garland disagrees, you know you&#x27;re in a difficult area.&quot;

====National security====
During Garland&#x27;s tenure, the D.C. Circuit reviewed cases arising from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In &quot;al Odah v. United States&quot; (2003), a panel that included Garland unanimously held that federal courts could not hear challenges from Guantanamo detainees. In July 2011, Garland wrote for the unanimous panel when it rejected Guantanamo detainee Moath Hamza Ahmed al Alawi&#x27;s petition for &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. In &quot;Parhat v. Gates&quot; (2008), Garland wrote for a panel that unanimously overturned the Combatant Status Review Tribunal&#x27;s determination that a captured Uyghur was an enemy combatant. In &quot;Saleh v. Titan Corp.&quot; (2009), Garland dissented from the court&#x27;s holding that former Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib prison could not sue private military contractors who participated in torture and prisoner abuse. Garland wrote that the suit should be allowed to proceed because &quot;no act of Congress and no judicial precedent&quot; immunized the contractors from tort liability, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically excludes contractors, and tort liability would not interfere with government operations.

====First Amendment====
According to Goldstein, Garland has &quot;tended to take a broader view&quot; of First Amendment rights. In cases involving the Freedom of Information Act and similar provisions related to government transparency, &quot;Judge Garland&#x27;s rulings reflect a preference for open government.&quot; In &quot;ACLU v. CIA&quot; (2013), Garland wrote for a panel unanimously rejecting the agency&#x27;s Glomar response and ordering it to process the ACLU&#x27;s FOIA request regarding targeted killings by CIA drones. In &quot;Cause of Action v. FTC&quot; (2015), Garland wrote for a panel unanimously overturning the agency&#x27;s limitation on FOIA fee waivers to large news outlets.

In &quot;Lee v. Department of Justice&quot; (2005), Garland dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc after the D.C. Circuit affirmed the district court&#x27;s order holding reporters in contempt of court for refusing to testify about their anonymous sources during the Wen Ho Lee investigation. Garland wrote that the panel had erred in failing to &quot;weigh the public interest in protecting the reporter&#x27;s sources against the private interest in compelling disclosure&quot; and that the decision &quot;undermined the Founders&#x27; intention to protect the press &#x27;so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;Initiative &amp; Referendum Institute v. U.S. Postal Service&quot; (2005), Garland wrote for the court, holding that a U.S. Postal Service regulation banning signature-gathering for petitions at post offices violated the First Amendment. Garland found the regulation to be facially overbroad and not narrowly tailored.

In cases involving campaign finance reform laws, Garland has applied &quot;Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission&quot; when he believed that he was compelled to do so, but he has not sought to extend its holding. In &quot;Wagner v. Federal Election Commission&quot; (2015), Garland wrote for the unanimous en banc D.C. Circuit in upholding a prohibition on campaign contributions from federal contractors because of the governmental interest in preventing corruption. In &quot;National Association of Manufacturers v. Taylor&quot; (2009), Garland wrote for the court in a decision upholding the constitutionality of lobbyist disclosure requirements under the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. Professor Rick Hasen, an election-law expert, writes that Garland&#x27;s opinions on election law are characterized by careful application of precedent and indicate that Garland believes in reasonable regulation.

Garland has addressed a number of religious freedom cases while on the D.C. Circuit, although several of these have been decided on procedural grounds. In 2002, Garland joined a unanimous court in ruling for two federal prisoners who were denied the right to consume communion wine. In 2010, Garland wrote the decision for a unanimous court in favor of an Interior Department employee who brought a religious-discrimination claim after the Interior Department refused to allow her to work weekdays rather than Sunday, when she wished to attend church and Bible study.

====Second Amendment====
In 2007, Garland voted in favor of &quot;en banc&quot; review of the D.C. Circuit&#x27;s panel decision in &quot;Parker v. District of Columbia&quot; invalidating the D.C. handgun ban. The Supreme Court subsequently affirmed this invalidation 5–4 in an opinion by Justice Scalia.

====Other cases====
In &quot;Alexander v. Daley&quot; (2003), Garland joined a decision (authored by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly), rejecting a challenge brought by District of Columbia residents seeking D.C. congressional voting rights.

In &quot;Hutchins v. District of Columbia&quot; (1999), Garland concurred with four other D.C. Circuit judges (&quot;en banc&quot;) that D.C.&#x27;s Juvenile Curfew Act of 1995 implicated at least some significant right of minors. He joined parts of a plurality opinion written by Judge Laurence Silberman that upheld the juvenile curfew under intermediate scrutiny and a vagueness challenge. Garland also joined the part of Judge Judith W. Rogers&#x27;s opinion (concurring in part and dissenting in part) holding that a fundamental right to intrastate travel exists.

===Retirement===
Garland retired from federal judicial service on March 11, 2021, to accept appointment as the Attorney General of the United States.

==Supreme Court nomination==
Garland was considered twice to fill vacated seats on the United States Supreme Court in 2009 and 2010, before finally being nominated in 2016 by President Barack Obama for the seat left vacant by the death of conservative Associate Justice Antonin Scalia.

===2009 and 2010 considerations===
In 2009, following the announcement by Justice David Souter that he would retire, Garland was considered as one of nine finalists for the post, which ultimately went to Sonia Sotomayor, then a judge of the Second Circuit.

After the April 2010 announcement by Justice John Paul Stevens that he would retire, Garland was again widely seen as a leading contender for a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. President Obama interviewed Garland, among others, for the vacancy. In May 2010, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, said he would help Obama if Garland was nominated, calling Garland &quot;a consensus nominee&quot; and predicting that Garland would win Senate confirmation with bipartisan support. Obama nominated Solicitor General of the United States Elena Kagan, who was confirmed in August 2010.

===Scalia vacancy and 2016 nomination===
On February 13, 2016, Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died. Later that day, Senate Republicans led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement that they would not consider any nominee put forth by Obama, and that a Supreme Court nomination should be left to the next president of the United States. President Obama responded that he intended to &quot;fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court,&quot; and that there was no &quot;well established tradition&quot; that a president could not fill a Supreme Court vacancy during their last year in office.

In early March 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Garland was being vetted by the Obama administration as a potential nominee. A week later, Garland was named as one of three judges on the President&#x27;s &quot;short list&quot; (along with Judge Sri Srinivasan, also of the D.C. Circuit, and Judge Paul J. Watford of the Ninth Circuit). Obama interviewed all three leading contenders, as well as two others who were being considered: Judge Jane L. Kelly of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Soon afterward, Senator Orrin Hatch, President pro tempore of the United States Senate and the most senior Republican Senator, predicted that President Obama would &quot;name someone the liberal Democratic base wants&quot; even though he &quot;could easily name Merrick Garland, who is a fine man.&quot; Five days later, on March 16, Obama formally nominated Garland to the vacant post of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.

Garland had more federal judicial experience than any other Supreme Court nominee in history, and was the oldest Supreme Court nominee since Lewis F. Powell Jr. in 1971. The American Bar Association (ABA) Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Garland &quot;well-qualified&quot; (its highest rating) to sit on the Supreme Court.

Under Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Senate&#x27;s Republican majority refused to consider Garland&#x27;s nomination, holding &quot;no hearings, no votes, no action whatsoever&quot; on the nomination. McConnell&#x27;s categorical refusal to hold hearings on Garland&#x27;s nomination was described by political scientists and legal scholars as unprecedented, McConnell&#x27;s choice to lead a Republican blockade of the nomination was described as a &quot;culmination of [his] confrontational style,&quot; and an example of constitutional hardball. Yascha Mounk called it a &quot;blatant abuse of constitutional norms.&quot;

After a period of 293 days, Garland&#x27;s nomination expired on January 3, 2017, at the end of the 114th Congress, the 15th nomination to the Supreme Court to lapse at the end of a session of Congress. It was the longest pending period of a Supreme Court nominee in history, far exceeding the 125-day delay faced by the ultimately confirmed Justice Louis Brandeis in 1916. On January 31, 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the Court vacancy. On April 7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court.

McConnell went on to boast about stopping Garland&#x27;s nomination, saying in August 2016, &quot;one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, &#x27;Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.&#x27;&quot; In April 2018, McConnell said the decision not to act upon the Garland nomination was &quot;the most consequential decision I&#x27;ve made in my entire public career&quot;.

==Attorney General of the United States (2021–2025)==
=== Nomination and confirmation ===
President-elect Joe Biden selected Garland for the position of United States attorney general, with news of the selection coming on January 6, 2021. He was formally nominated by Biden on January 20, after Biden took office. In Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, Garland vowed to oversee vigorous prosecution of those who stormed the United States Capitol, and other domestic extremists, drawing on his experience prosecuting the perpetrators of the Oklahoma City bombing. Garland said it was likely the Biden administration would place a moratorium on use of the federal death penalty and expressed reservations about the death penalty in light of the &quot;almost randomness or arbitrariness of its application.&quot; He pledged to protect equal justice under law and reinvigorate the DOJ Civil Rights Division, which, according to some media figures, languished under the Trump administration. Garland affirmed that the Justice Department would remain independent under his leadership. The Senate Judiciary Committee voted 15–7 to advance Garland&#x27;s nomination to the Senate floor, and on March 10, the Senate confirmed Garland&#x27;s nomination by a vote of 70–30. He was sworn in on March 11, 2021, by Assistant Attorney General for Administration Lee Lofthus.

=== Tenure ===
In April 2021, Russia imposed sanctions against Garland, including prohibiting him from entering Russia. This was in retaliation for U.S. expulsion of 10 Russian diplomats, a sanction imposed by the United States against Russia for its SolarWinds hack, aggression against Ukraine, and interference in the 2020 U.S. election.

In May 2021, the DOJ appealed in part a ruling by Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the District Court for the District of Columbia to make public most of a DOJ memo detailing former attorney general Bill Barr&#x27;s legal rationale for clearing President Trump of obstruction of justice in the Special Counsel investigation.

On June 7, 2021, the Justice Department continued its defense of a defamation lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, arguing that Trump could not be sued because he had denied her rape allegation in offending statements in his presidential capacity. Garland had been deeply involved in the decision. The White House quickly distanced itself from the decision. Garland in a House Judiciary Committee hearing on October 21 stated that the DOJ&#x27;s briefing was solely on the question of the application of the Federal Tort Claims Act.

On July 1, 2021, Garland imposed a moratorium on all federal executions pending a review of relevant policies and procedures. The review will examine &quot;the risk of pain and suffering associated with the use of pentobarbital,&quot; &quot;regulations made in November 2020 that expanded the permissible methods of execution beyond lethal injection, and authorized the use of state facilities and personnel in federal executions&quot;, and &quot;December 2020 and January 2021 changes to expedite execution of capital sentences.&quot; This was consistent with Biden&#x27;s pledge to push for legislation to end the federal death penalty. In spite of this, Garland has continued to pursue the death penalty in cases in which a previous administration had sought the death penalty against a suspected terrorist. The Trump administration resumed federal executions in 2019, and executed 13 inmates in total, the first in 17 years and including the first woman in 70 years.

=== Voting rights ===

In June 2021, Garland pledged to double the department&#x27;s enforcement staff for protecting the right to vote, in response to Republican Party efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election, The same month, Garland announced a DOJ lawsuit against the state of Georgia over its newly passed restrictions on voting; the DOJ complaint said that the state targeted Black Americans in violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

In July 2021, the Justice Department released two guidance documents regarding election law changes and post-election audits, reminding states that the DOJ was closely observing states&#x27; compliance with federal election and civil rights laws.

In November 2021, the DOJ sued Texas over Senate Bill 1 which required rejection of mail ballots &quot;for immaterial errors and omissions,&quot; alleging it would restrict voting for those with limited English proficiency, soldiers deployed and voters overseas.

In a separate suit filed by DOJ against Texas the following month, the federal government alleged that Texas&#x27; redistricting plans discriminated against Latino and Black voters in violation of the Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

=== Civil rights ===
During Garland&#x27;s tenure as AG, the Justice Department has emphasized protection of civil rights. Garland rescinded a Trump administration policy (imposed by Jeff Sessions) that curtailed DOJ investigations into police department misconduct (&quot;pattern-and-practice&quot; investigations) and restricted the use of consent decrees to reform police departments.

On April 21, 2021, Garland subsequently announced that the DOJ was opening a pattern-and-practice investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department after former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted for the murder of George Floyd, examining the use of force by officers and discriminatory conduct, its treatment of people with behavioral health issues, and the department&#x27;s current accountability systems. On April 26, Garland announced another investigation into the Louisville Metro Police Department in the aftermath of the killing of Breonna Taylor, examining the execution of search warrants. On August 5, Garland opened another investigation into the Phoenix Police Department over its policies on dealing with the homeless. On December 3, the DOJ opened another investigation into the Mount Vernon Police Department to assess if it engaged in discriminatory policing, involving its use of force, strip and body cavity searches, how it handles evidence, and its systems of accountability.

In June 2021, the DOJ, through a memo issued by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, reversed a Trump-era policy that banned federal officers and agents from using body-worn cameras; the memo also mandated the use of body-worn cameras for federal law enforcement in certain circumstances (including when carrying out planned arrests or executing search warrants).

On September 14, 2021, the DOJ announced a civil investigation into prisons in Georgia, focusing on prison violence and sexual abuse of LGBTQ prisoners by prisoners and staff, continuing with an initial investigation launched in 2016.

In September, 2021, the DOJ in a memo limited the use of chokeholds and carotid restraints by federal officers during arrests, prohibiting such tactics unless deadly force is authorized (i.e., unless the officer reasonably believes &quot;that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person&quot;). The memo also limited the use of unannounced (&quot;no-knock&quot;) entries when executing warrants, directing officers to knock-and-announce except &quot;where an agent has reasonable grounds to believe that knocking and announcing the agent’s presence would create an imminent threat of physical violence to the agent and/or another person.&quot;

On October 13, 2021, the DOJ launched another investigation into five juvenile detention facilities in Texas for systemic physical or sexual abuse of children.

=== January 6 U.S. Capitol attack ===
On July 26, 2021, the DOJ sent letters to former DOJ officials of the Trump administration, including Acting Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen, Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue, Associate Deputy Attorney General Patrick Hovakimian, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Byung J. &quot;BJay&quot; Pak, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia Bobby L. Christine, and United States Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division Jeffrey Clark. The letters relayed that the DOJ would not exert executive privilege over their testimony as witnesses to Trump&#x27;s attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election or the 2021 United States Capitol attack, and that they were free to provide &quot;unrestricted testimony&quot; and &quot;irrespective of potential privilege&quot; to the House Oversight Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee.

On July 28, 2021, the DOJ further rejected Rep. Mo Brooks&#x27;s request to protect him in Eric Swalwell&#x27;s civil lawsuit against him and Trump concerning his comments and actions in the attack. The DOJ in a court filing determined that Brooks&#x27; relevant comments and actions were outside the scope of his official responsibilities as a member of Congress.

On October 21, 2021, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to refer Steve Bannon, the adviser to former president Donald Trump, to the DOJ for criminal contempt of Congress due to defying a subpoena from the House&#x27;s January 6 select committee over claims of executive privilege. After Speaker Nancy Pelosi certified the contempt referral, it was sent to the U.S. Attorney for DC, who will then decide whether to send the referral to a grand jury for indictment, with Garland having the final say. Garland told lawmakers that the Justice Department &quot;will apply the facts and the law and make a decision&quot; when considering a criminal contempt referral for Bannon. He stated that &quot;the Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances, we&#x27;ll apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution.&quot;

In November 2022, days after Trump announced his 2024 presidential campaign, Garland appointed Jack Smith to serve as special counsel for the investigations of Trump.

=== Robert Hur report===

On February 8, 2024, the Department of Justice released a report authored by special counsel Robert Hur into President Biden&#x27;s handling of classified documents, concluding that charges were not necessary in the incident. As part of its reasoning not to charge Biden, the report mentioned perceived problems with Biden&#x27;s memory and mental acuity. Biden was interviewed by Hur during the investigation, helping form the report&#x27;s conclusions.

Garland has been criticized by supporters of Biden and some former prosecutors for his decision to release Hur&#x27;s report referring to Biden as an &quot;elderly man with a poor memory.&quot; They alleged that Hur&#x27;s report included gratuitous language about Biden that could be used to reinforce perceptions that Biden is fading mentally and physically.

Associate deputy attorney general Bradley Weinsheimer, the DOJ&#x27;s senior nonpolitical career official, rejected criticisms of the report, stating that the report&#x27;s comments &quot;fall well within the department&#x27;s standards for public release&quot;. Garland stated that Hur had never proposed an investigative step which he found to be inappropriate.

== Controversies ==

=== School board memo ===
In October 2021, amid a surge of threats against school board members across the country, Garland issued a memorandum addressing an &quot;increase in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff&quot;; the memo directed the FBI and US attorneys&#x27; offices to set up meetings with federal, state and local law enforcement leaders for establishing tiplines for threat reporting and discussing strategies to address such threats. He issued the memo soon after the National School Boards Association wrote to Biden to request a federal response to the protests and threats against school officials and investigations into whether they constituted as forms of domestic terrorism and hate crimes.

The memo prompted criticism from Republicans in the House and Senate, who accused Garland of treating parents like domestic terrorists, although the memo did not mention either of them. McConnell wrote to Garland that parents &quot;absolutely should be telling&quot; local schools what to teach regarding contentious public issues. In House and Senate Judiciary Committee hearings, Garland pushed back on Republicans&#x27; claims that the DOJ were treating parents like &quot;domestic terrorists&quot; and investigating political speech, testifying that the DOJ &quot;[were] not investigating peaceful protest or parent involvement at school board meetings.&quot; Numerous Senate Republicans called on Garland to resign over the memo. Seventeen Republican state attorneys general led by Todd Rokita, and numerous House Republicans, separately wrote to Biden and Garland requesting the memorandum be immediately withdrawn.

=== Contempt of congress charges ===
The House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee issued subpoenas for Garland to turn over materials related to Hur&#x27;s investigation, particularly audio of Hur&#x27;s interview with Biden. Biden subsequently invoked executive privilege to block the release of the materials, preventing Garland from turning them over. Department of Justice officials also argued that the audio of Biden&#x27;s interview could be fraudulently edited or deepfaked and that the disclosure could hamper cooperation in future investigations. On June 12, 2024, Garland was held in contempt by the House of Representatives for defying the subpoenas and refusing to disclose audio of Hur&#x27;s interview with Biden. The Department of Justice stated that Garland cannot be prosecuted for contempt due to Biden&#x27;s invocation of executive privilege.

House speaker Mike Johnson said he will move in federal court to enforce a subpoena against Garland to obtain audio recordings of Biden, after the Justice Department declined to act on the House&#x27;s contempt referral.

Three lawsuits have been filed by organizations seeking access to the audio recordings of the Biden interview. Judicial Watch, the Heritage Foundation and CNN are the plaintiffs in these lawsuits, which are based on the failure of the Department of Justice to provide the audio in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. CNN&#x27;s lawsuit has been joined by eleven other news organizations. The three lawsuits have been consolidated and are pending before Judge Timothy Kelly.

On July 11, 2024, an attempt by the House of Representatives to find United States attorney general Garland in &quot;inherent contempt&quot; of Congress fell short in a 204 to 210 vote, with four Republicans voting with all Democrats to oppose the measure. The resolution would have imposed a fine of $10,000 per day on Garland for defying a congressional subpoena until he handed over audio of former special counsel Robert Hur&#x27;s interview with President Joe Biden.

=== Pace of Trump prosecution ===
Garland has been criticized for the pace of the prosecution of president Donald Trump. Some observers, reportedly including President Joe Biden, assign him some responsibility for the fact that none of the indictments obtained by special counsel Jack Smith were likely to go to trial before the November 2024 election. California representative Adam Schiff is quoted as saying &quot;I think that delay has contributed to a situation where none of these trials may go forward. The department bears some of that responsibility.&quot; Others have defended Garland, such as Marcy Wheeler, who cited &quot;unavoidable&quot; delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of encrypted messaging apps by defendants, and invocations of attorney–client and executive privilege claims by witnesses and co-defendants that needed to be litigated before any case could go to trial, while highlighting avoidable delays caused by the January 6 committee, which pushed back the Proud Boys trial by several months. Commentators have also pointed to substantial delays stemming from John Roberts and the Supreme Court&#x27;s immunity decision in &quot;Trump v. United States&quot;. After Trump&#x27;s re-election for a second non-consecutive term, further criticism was directed against Garland.

== Personal life ==
Garland and his wife, Lynn, were married at the Harvard Club in Midtown Manhattan in September 1987. Lynn Rosenman Garland&#x27;s grandfather, Samuel Irving Rosenman, was a justice of the New York Supreme Court (a trial-level court) and a special counsel to presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and cum laude from Harvard University, and received a Master of Science degree in operations management from the MIT Sloan School of Management. Her father, Robert Rosenman, was a partner in the New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore. As of June 2018, she advised government and nonprofit groups on voting systems security and accuracy issues. The couple lives together in Bethesda, Maryland.

Garland and his wife have two daughters: Rebecca and Jessica, both of whom are graduates of Yale University. Justice Elena Kagan hired Jessica Garland, a 2019 graduate of Yale Law School, as one of her law clerks in early July 2020, before Biden&#x27;s election and Garland&#x27;s appointment, to serve as a law clerk in 2022–2023. The Supreme Court said that &quot;in light of the potential for actual or apparent conflicts of interest,&quot; Jessica Garland will not serve as Kagan&#x27;s law clerk while her father remains as attorney general. Garland took part in the ceremony when his daughter Rebecca married Xan Tanner in June 2018.

Financial disclosure forms in 2016 indicated that Garland&#x27;s net worth at the time was between $6million and $23M. As of 2021, his net worth was estimated by &quot;Forbes&quot; at $8.6-33M.

Garland is red-green colorblind, so he uses a list to match his suits and ties. He is a Reform Jew.

<doc id="1110158" wikidata="Q3376406" url="?curid=1110158" title="Pete Sampras Tennis">
<text>Pete Sampras Tennis is a sports video game developed by Zeppelin Games and published by Codemasters for the Sega Genesis and Game Gear in 1994. A Master System version was cancelled in development. It was followed by &quot;Sampras Tennis 96&quot; for the Genesis and &quot;Pete Sampras Tennis &#x27;97&quot;.

==Gameplay==
While &quot;Pete Sampras Tennis&quot; uses all three control pad buttons, the game play remains simple yet realistic, for its time. While serving, the A button sends the ball automatically, and B allows the player to control the ball speed and direction, and is the only way to score aces against the best players. During play, A lobs, B sends a normal shot and C, if pressed alone performs a top spin shot, if in conjunction with left or right on the D-Pad the player dives in that direction. It is also possible to aim the ball by pressing any direction on the D-Pad before there is contact between the racket and the ball.

Expert players are able to win against any computer player without giving a point away, since the AI isn&#x27;t very well developed (and there are no difficulty options) and it&#x27;s hard to miss a ball. The most usual tactic is to lure the opponent into the net (by making low shots), and then expect he bounces against a mid-height ball close to the net, or if he manages to return, call in a long lob, leaving the opponent with no chances of returning the ball. With harder-hitting characters, it is possible to make strong and accurate returns after the serve, which the computer-controlled player rarely manages to return.

While managing to make perfect use of the lob and spinning shot aim is essential to play the game, top spins can be more a nuisance than helpful. Since it shares the same button as dives, and a good top spin shot requires additional power control (by either pressing up or down), Sega&#x27;s 8-direction pads, if broken or dirty, or even simply if the user&#x27;s finger slipped, top spin shots often ended up turning into a dive, the ball passing uselessly by the helpless player.

==Characters==
The only real tennis player is Pete Sampras. All players, however, have different ratings for base line, service, speed and volleys, and there is a noticeable difference between left- and right-handed players. Not all players can be used in the &quot;World Tour&quot; mode, as some of them are actual opponents.

==Events==
There are only three surfaces to choose from (Grass, Hard and Clay). Although the surfaces are not sufficiently differentiated to impinge on AI or player tactics, the bounce of the ball is lowest on Grass and highest on Clay, with Hard intermediate. There are several places where matches and tournaments in the Huge Tour take place, and they are accurate on the kind of surface that tournament actually uses: London (Wimbledon) is played on grass, Paris (Roland Garros) on clay, New York (Flushing Meadows) on hard court, etc. Each surface has three different sets, with the scoreboard on the left, right or middle. This is probably one indication of the court in use: most games during Huge Tour tournaments are played in the sided scoreboard courts, except the final.

==Game modes==
The game has three main modes: Challenge match, Tournament and World Tour. By inserting the &quot;Zeppelin&quot; password, two extra modes are unlocked: Crazy Tennis and Huge Tour.

===Main modes===
Challenge matches are simple head-to-head matches, where everything can be customized, from game length (1/3/5 sets), location and the kind of game (singles or doubles). All players can be chosen (including opponents in the World Tour), and if the J-Cart is in use, 4 players can play simultaneously.

Tournament is the &quot;party&quot; mode. From four to eight players can compete head to head in a knockout competition until the best two matchup in the final. Although it is not possible to change the match length (5 sets only), each player can choose a handicap, from none to three sets.

The single-player only game mode, called World Tour, is a one set only, composed by 18 rounds across the globe. Some of the players are not available (Sampras included) since they are opponents during the tournament. Since the game is easy, this mode can be beaten in few days.

===Extra modes===
Crazy Tennis is one arcade-ish mode where players get points from simply hitting the ball. There is one overall sense of wackiness in this mode, as some lower balls are blocked by a popup racket on the net, some powerups increase the size of the ball or allow direct control of its path, and there is even a cameo from Dizzy, who walks on the net and works as a piñata. After five hits Dizzy breaks, giving several points to the last player who hit the ball. Players can get points from hitting the ball, breaking Dizzy and winning the point, which aggregates all the points played since the last service (which is done automatically by a machine, instead of a player). The game is timed, and both players must achieve the target score - if one of them reaches the timer without the required score, the game ends and the player with the higher score is declared winner.

The Huge Tour mode is a complete competition, nearly a season simulation. There are both men, women and mixed tournaments, for the highest rewarded a minimum place in the ranking is required. In order to win the Australian Open (the season opener) one must first complete a season first. Up to eight players can compete at the same time, the match length is the official: five sets for men, three for women.

== Reception ==

&quot;Next Generation&quot; gave the Genesis version of the game two stars out of five, commenting that &quot;Pete Sampras Tennis&quot; is an action-oriented tennis game without much action.

<doc id="1110161" wikidata="Q5977344" url="?curid=1110161" title="I Got a Name">
<text>I Got a Name is the fifth and final studio album and first posthumous release by American singer-songwriter, Jim Croce, released on December 1, 1973. It features the ballad &quot;I&#x27;ll Have to Say I Love You in a Song&quot;, which reached number 9 in the US singles chart, and the ballad &quot;Salon and Saloon&quot;, the last song Croce recorded in his lifetime. The song, which is noted for its sparse piano-only vocal backing, was written by his guitarist and friend Maury Muehleisen and was included on the album as a gift to the writer.
This would be Croce&#x27;s final album, as he died in a plane crash on September 20, 1973.

&quot;I Got a Name&quot; was used as the theme for the films &quot;The Last American Hero&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;. It was a posthumous hit for Croce, reaching number 10 in the US singles chart.

The album reached number 2 on the US charts behind his earlier album &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot; in first place.

<doc id="1110171" wikidata="Q1516561" url="?curid=1110171" title="History of Ontario">
<text>The history of Ontario covers the period from the arrival of Paleo-Indians thousands of years ago to the present day. The lands that make up present-day Ontario, the most populous province of Canada as of the early 21st century have been inhabited for millennia by groups of Aboriginal people, with French and British exploration and colonization commencing in the 17th century. Before the arrival of Europeans, the region was inhabited both by Algonquian (Ojibwa, Cree and Algonquin) and Iroquoian (Iroquois, Petun and Huron) tribes.

French explorer Étienne Brûlé surveyed part of the area in 1610–12. The English explorer Henry Hudson sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed the area for England, but Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615. In their effort to secure the North American fur trade, the English / British and the French established a number of fur trading forts in Ontario during the 17th and 18th centuries; with the former establishing a number of forts around Hudson Bay, and the latter establishing forts throughout the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en Haut&quot; region. Control over the area remained contested until the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, when the 1763 Treaty of Paris awarded the colony of New France to the British.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the province saw an influx of loyalist settle the area. In response to the influx of loyalist refugees, the &quot;Constitutional Act of 1791&quot; was enacted, splitting the colony of Quebec into Lower Canada (present day southern Quebec) and Upper Canada (present day southern Ontario). The Canadas were reunited as the Province of Canada by the &quot;Act of Union 1840&quot;. On July 1, 1867, the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia were united to form a single federation. The Province of Canada was split into two provinces at Confederation, with the area east of the Ottawa River forming Quebec, and the area west of the river forming Ontario.
== Initial settlement and Archaic period ==
Paleo-Indians were the first people to settle on the lands of Ontario, about 11,000 years ago, after crossing the Bering land bridge from Asia to North America between 25,000 to 50,000 years ago. During the Archaic period, which lasted from 8000-1000 BC, the population slowly increased, with a generally egalitarian hunter-gatherer society and a warmer climate. Trading routes also began emerging along the St. Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes.

==Woodland period==


The Woodland period directly followed the Archaic period. It saw the introduction of ceramics in the Early Woodland period, horticultural experimentation with different crops (notably maize, or corn) as well as elaborate burial ceremonialism during the Middle Woodland, and the emergence of agriculture and village settlements by the Late Woodland. Especially by the Late Woodland, there was a divergence between northern and southern Ontario, as agriculture only took place in southern Ontario. However, northern Ontario saw significant changes in pottery and a continuation of mound building practices. Pictographs are associated with the Late Woodland, and continue as a practice into the time following European arrival, with the appearance of pictographs representing horses, firearms, and ships.

By at least the latter part of the Woodland period, a number of indigenous societies formed a broad fabric of ethnic groups, some of which were politically organized as confederacies. In the territory of modern-day Ontario, examples of these include the interconnected Huron, Petun, and Neutral confederacies. These Northern Iroquoian peoples were more distantly related to the Iroquois Confederacy to the south. The territory was also inhabited by Algonquian peoples such as the Ojibwe, Cree, and Algonquin.

==Pays d&#x27;en Haut==

French explorer Étienne Brûlé surveyed part of the area in 1610–12. The English explorer Henry Hudson sailed into Hudson Bay in 1611 and claimed the area for England, but Samuel de Champlain reached Lake Huron in 1615. French Jesuit missionaries began to establish posts along the Great Lakes, forging alliances in particular with the Huron people. Permanent French settlement was hampered by their hostilities with the Five Nations of the Iroquois (based in New York State), who became allied with the British. By the early 1650s, using both British and Dutch arms, they had succeeded in pushing other related Iroquoian-speaking peoples, the Petun and Neutral Nation, out of or to the fringes of territorial southern Ontario. In 1747 a small number of French settlers established the oldest continually inhabited European community in what became western Ontario; &quot;Petite Côte&quot; was settled on the south bank of the Detroit River across from Fort Detroit and near Huron and Petun villages.

The British established trading posts on Hudson Bay in the late 17th century.

== Province of Quebec ==

With their victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, the 1763 Treaty of Paris gave nearly all of France&#x27;s North American possessions (New France) to Britain. Lands like Canada and the Pays d&#x27;en Haut were bundled together and renamed the Province of Quebec after the city of Quebec. The first English settlements in what is today Ontario occurred in 1782–1784 in Thousand Islands and the Niagara Peninsula, when 5,000 American loyalists fled the American Revolution and settled there. From 1783 to 1796, Britain granted individuals 200 acres (0.8 km2) of land per household and other items as compensation for their losses in the Thirteen Colonies and a start for rebuilding their lives.

==Upper Canada==
The Constitutional Act of 1791 recognized this development, as it split the Province of Quebec into the Canadas, Lower Canada east of the St. Lawrence-Ottawa River confluence, the area of earliest settlement; and Upper Canada southwest of the confluence. John Graves Simcoe was appointed Upper Canada&#x27;s first Lieutenant-Governor in 1793.

=== War of 1812 ===

Owing to grievances from the impressment of American sailors by the British, and suspected British support of Native Americans in the American Northwest Territory, the United States declared war on the United Kingdom on July 1, 1812. Given its proximity to the United States, colonies in British North America, including Upper Canada found itself an active theatre of war throughout most of the conflict. 

The earliest offensives of the war took place near southwestern Ontario and the upper Great Lakes region, with American forces briefly crossing into present day southwestern Ontario, before a British-First Nations force launched an offensive into the Michigan Territory. However, on September 10, 1813, after the Americans gained control of Lake Erie, British forces evacuated Detroit, and eventually decided to withdraw from the entire area. American forces under William Henry Harrison caught up to the retreating British-First Nations force, decisively defeating them at the Battle of the Thames. Tecumseh, leader of a Native American confederation, was killed shortly after the remaining British forces decided to fall back to Burlington; disrupting the military alliance between British and First Nations.

Several invasion attempts by American forces were also attempted at the Niagara Peninsula. On October 13, 1812, an American invasion attempt was prevented at the Battle of Queenston Heights; although the commander of British forces in Upper Canada, Major-General Isaac Brock, was killed during the battle. On April 27, 1813, American forces raided and briefly occupied York, the capital of Upper Canada. A month later, American forces captured Fort George prompting the British to retreat to the Burlington Heights. However, further advances into the peninsula by American forces were halted at the battles of Stoney Creek and Beaver Dams; prompting the Americans to eventual withdraw from the peninsula on December 10, 1813. An American invasion force advancing towards Montreal was also repulsed at the Battle of Chrysler&#x27;s Farm on November 13, 1813.

In the summer of 1814, the Americans conducted another invasion of the Niagara Peninsula, successfully defeating the British at the Battle of Chippewa. However, American forces were prompted to withdraw to Fort Erie following the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane on July 25, 1814. American forces managed to repulse a British siege of the fort, although the Americans evacuated the fort shortly after the siege was over in November 1814. Transgressions conducted by American occupying forces while in Upper Canada, including the burning of York and the raid on Port Dover later influenced the actions of British commanders in other theatres of the war, most notably the burning of Buffalo and Washington. The conflict was concluded in December 1814 with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent.

=== Transportation ===
After the War of 1812, relative stability attracted increasing numbers of immigrants from Britain and Ireland rather than from the United States. Colonial leaders encouraged this new immigration. However, many arriving newcomers from Europe (mostly from Britain and Ireland) found frontier life difficult, and some of those with the means eventually returned home or went south. But population growth far exceeded emigration from this area in the following decades.

Canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving relations over time. Ontario&#x27;s numerous waterways aided travel and transportation into the interior and supplied water power for development. Canals were capital-intensive infrastructure projects that facilitated trade. The Oswego Canal, built in New York 1825–1829, was a vital commercial link in the Great Lakes–Atlantic seaway. It was connected to Ontario&#x27;s Welland Canal in 1829. The newly fashioned Oswego–Welland line offered an alternate route to the St. Lawrence River and Europe, as opposed to the Erie Canal, which connected the Great Lakes to New York City via the Mohawk and Hudson rivers.

=== Family Compact ===

In the absence of a hereditary aristocracy, Upper Canada was run by an oligarchy or closed group of powerful men who controlled most of the political, judicial, and economic power from the 1810s to the 1830s. Opponents called it the &quot;Family Compact&quot;, but its members avoided the term. In the religious sphere, a key leader was John Strachan (1778–1867), the Anglican bishop of Toronto. Strachan (and the Family Compact generally) was opposed by Methodist leader Egerton Ryerson (1803–1882). The Family Compact consisted of English gentry who arrived before 1800, and the sons of United Empire Loyalists, who were exiles who fled the American revolution. The term &quot;family&quot; was metaphorical, for they generally were not related by blood or marriage. There were no elections and the leadership controlled appointments, so local officials were generally allies of the leaders.

The Family Compact looked to Britain for the ideal model of society, where landed aristocrats held power. The Family Compact was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy, especially the rowdy United States version. They developed the theme that they and their militia had defeated American attempts to annex Canada in the War of 1812. They were based in Toronto, and were integrated with the bankers, merchants, and financiers of the city, and were active in promoting canals and railroads.

=== Upper Canada Rebellion ===
Many men chafed against the anti-democratic Family Compact that governed through personal connections among the elite, which controlled the best lands. This resentment spurred republican ideals and sowed the seeds for early Canadian nationalism. Accordingly, rebellion in favour of responsible government rose in both regions; Louis-Joseph Papineau led the Lower Canada Rebellion and William Lyon Mackenzie led the Upper Canada Rebellion. The rebellions failed but there were long-term changes that resolved the issue.

==Canada West==
Although both rebellions were put down in short order, the British government sent Lord Durham to investigate the causes of the unrest. He recommended that self-government be granted and that Lower and Upper Canada be re-joined in an attempt to assimilate the French Canadians. Accordingly, the two colonies were merged into the Province of Canada by the &quot;Act of Union (1840)&quot;, with the capital at Kingston, and Upper Canada becoming known as Canada West. Parliamentary self-government was granted in 1848.

Due to waves of increased immigration in the 1840s, the population of Canada West more than doubled by 1851 over the previous decade. As a result, for the first time the English-speaking population of Canada West surpassed the French-speaking population of Canada East, tilting the representative balance of power.

An economic boom in the 1850s, brought on by factors such as a free trade agreement with the United States, coincided with massive railway expansion across the province, furthering the economic strength of Central Canada, pre-confederation.

==Confederation and the late-19th century== 
A political stalemate between the French- and English-speaking legislators, as well as fear of aggression from the United States during the American Civil War, led the political elite to hold a series of conferences in the 1860s to effect a broader federal union of all British North American colonies. The &quot;British North America Act&quot; (BNA Act) took effect on July 1, 1867, establishing the Dominion of Canada, initially with four provinces: Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, and Ontario. The Province of Canada was divided at this point into Ontario and Quebec so that each major European linguistic group would have its own province.

Both Quebec and Ontario were required by section 93 of the BNA Act to safeguard existing educational rights and privileges of the relative Protestant and Catholic minorities. Thus, separate Catholic schools and school boards were permitted in Ontario. However, neither province had a constitutional requirement to protect its French- or English-speaking minority. Toronto was formally established as Ontario&#x27;s provincial capital at this time.
Once constituted as a province, Ontario proceeded to assert its economic and legislative power. In 1872, the Liberal Party leader Oliver Mowat became premier, and remained as premier until 1896, despite Conservative control in Ottawa. Mowat fought for provincial rights, weakening the power of the federal government in provincial matters, usually through well-argued appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. His battles with the federal government greatly decentralized Canada, giving the provinces far more power than Prime Minister John A. Macdonald had intended.

Mowat consolidated and expanded Ontario&#x27;s educational and provincial institutions, created districts in Northern Ontario, and fought tenaciously to ensure that those parts of Northwestern Ontario not historically part of Upper Canada (the vast areas north and west of the Lake Superior-Hudson Bay watershed, known as the District of Keewatin) would become part of Ontario, a victory embodied in the &quot;Canada (Ontario Boundary) Act, 1889&quot;. He also presided over the emergence of the province into the economic powerhouse of Canada. Mowat was the creator of what is often called &quot;Empire Ontario&quot;.

The boundary between Ontario and Manitoba became a hotly contested matter, with the federal government attempting to extend Manitoba&#x27;s jurisdiction eastward to the Great Lakes, into the areas claimed by Ontario. In 1882 Premier Mowat threatened to pull Ontario from Confederation over the issue. Mowat sent police into the disputed territory to assert Ontario&#x27;s claims, while Manitoba (at the behest of the national government) did the same. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Britain, serving as Canada&#x27;s highest appeal court, repeatedly issued rulings taking the side of provincial rights. These decisions would to some extent neutralize the power of the central government, creating a more decentralized federation.

John Ibbitson writes that by 1914:
:Confederation had evolved into a creation beyond John A. Macdonald&#x27;s worst nightmare. Powerful, independent provinces, sovereign within their own spheres, manipulated the rights of property, levied their own taxes—even income taxes, in a few cases—exploited their natural resources, and managed schools, hospitals, and relief for the poor, while a weak and ineffectual central government presided over not much of anything in the drab little capital on the banks of the Ottawa.

Meanwhile, Ontario&#x27;s Conservative Party leader William Ralph Meredith had difficulty balancing the province&#x27;s particular interests with his national party&#x27;s centralism. Meredith was further undercut by lack of support from the national Conservative party and his own elitist aversion to popular politics at the provincial level.

In the 1894 election, the main issues were the Liberals&#x27; &quot;Ontario System&quot;, as well as opposition to French language schools and a rise in anti-Catholicism (led by the Protestant Protective Association (PPA)); farmer interests as expressed by the new Patrons of Industry; support for Toronto business, woman suffrage, and the temperance movement; and the demands of labour unions. Mowat and the Liberals maintained their large majority in the assembly.

===Economic development===
====Transportation====
As the population increased, so did the industries and transportation networks, which in turn led to further development. By the end of the 19th century, Ontario vied with Quebec as the nation&#x27;s leader in terms of growth in population, industry, arts, and communications.

Ontario large manufacturing and finance sectors waxed profitable in the late 19th century. Lucrative new markets opened up nationwide thanks to the federal government&#x27;s high-tariff National Policy after 1879, which limited competition from the United States. New markets out west opened after construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (1875–1885) through Northern Ontario to the Prairies and British Columbia. Tens of thousands of European immigrants, as well as native Canadians, moved west along the railroad in order to acquire land and set up new farms. They shipped their wheat east and bought from local merchants who placed orders with Ontario wholesalers, especially those based in Toronto.

====Farming====

Farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896. The major changes involved mechanization of technology and a shift toward high-profit, high-quality consumer products, such as milk, eggs, and vegetables, for the fast-growing urban markets. It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops. Introduced in the 1890s, acceptance was slow until 1943–52, when farmers in the southwestern counties expanded production. Farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques. Their demands led to farm magazine and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which developed as the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph in 1874.

Commercial wine production in the province began in the 1860s with an aristocrat from France, Count Justin McCarthy De Courtenay in County Peel. His success followed the realization that the right grapes could grow in the cold climate, producing an inexpensive good wine that could reach a commercial market. He gained government support and raised the capital for a commercial-scale vineyard and winery. His financial success encouraged others to enter the business.

====Social welfare====
The care of illegitimate children was a high priority for private charities. Before 1893, the Ontario government appropriated grants to charitable infants&#x27; homes for the infants and for their nursing mothers. Most of these infants were illegitimate, and most of their mothers were poor. Many babies were admitted to the homes in poor physical condition, so that their chances of survival outside such homes was poor.

===Culture===
====Religion====
The changes in the next generation in the town of Woodstock in southwestern Ontario exemplified the shift of power from the Tory elite to middle-class merchants and professionals. The once-unquestioned leadership of the magistracy and the Anglican Church, with their closed interlocking networks of patron-client relations, faded year by year as modern ideas of respectability based on merit and economic development grew apace. The new middle class was solidly in control by the 1870s, and the old elite had all but vanished.

While Anglicans consolidated their hold on the upper classes, workingmen and farmers responded to the Methodist revivals, often sponsored by visiting preachers from the United States. Typical was Rev. James Caughey, an American sent by the Wesleyan Methodist Church from the 1840s through 1864. He brought in the converts by the score, most notably in the revivals in Canada West 1851–53. His technique combined restrained emotionalism with a call for personal commitment, coupled with follow-up action to organize support from converts. It was a time when the Holiness Movement caught fire, with the revitalized interest of men and women in Christian perfection. Caughey bridged the gap between the style of earlier camp meetings and the needs of more sophisticated Methodist congregations in the emerging cities.

====Sport and recreation====
Travellers commented on the class differentials in recreation, contrasting the gentrified masculinity of the British middle class and the rough-and-ready bush masculinity of the workers. Working-class audiences responded to cockfights, boxing matches, wrestling, and animal baiting. That was too bloody for gentlemen and army officers, who favoured games that promoted honour and built character. Middle-class sports, especially lacrosse and snowshoeing, evolved from military training. Ice hockey proved a success among both refined gentlemen and bloodthirsty labourers.

The ideals promulgated by English author and reformer Thomas Hughes, especially as expressed in &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s Schooldays&quot; (1857), gave the middle class a model for sports that provided moral education and training for citizenship. Late in the 19th century, the Social Gospel themes of muscular Christianity were influential, as in the invention of basketball in 1891 by James Naismith, an Ontarian employed at the International Young Men&#x27;s Christian Association Training School in Massachusetts. Outside of sports, the social and moral agendas behind muscular Christianity influenced numerous reform movements, thus linking it to the political left in Canada.

===Medicine===
Numerous local rivalries had to be overcome before physicians could form a single, self-regulating, and unified medical body for licensing and educating practitioners. Professionalization began with the first medical board in 1818, and an 1827 act that required all doctors to be licensed. From the 1840s on, the number of new doctors with medical degrees increased rapidly because of legislation and the establishment of local medical schools. The Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons was chartered in 1869.

As physicians became better organized, they gained passage of laws controlling the practice of medicine and pharmacy, and banning marginal and traditional practitioners. Midwifery—practised along traditional lines by women—was restricted and practically died out by 1900. Even so, the great majority of childbirths took place at home until the 1920s, when hospitals became preferred, especially by women who were better educated, wealthier and more modern, and more trusting of modern medicine.

==20th century Ontario==

In 1912, Regulation 17 was a regulation introduced by the government of Ontario designed to shut down French-language schools at a time that Francophones from Quebec were moving into eastern Ontario. In July 1912, the Conservative government of Sir James P. Whitney issued Regulation 17, which severely limited the provision of French-language schooling to the province&#x27;s French-speaking minority. French could only be used in the first two years of schooling, and after that students and teachers were required to use English in classrooms. Few of the teachers at the French-language schools were fluent in English, so the schools had to close. The French-Canadian population, which was growing rapidly in eastern Ontario from migration, reacted with outrage; journalist Henri Bourassa denounced the &quot;Prussians of Ontario&quot;. With the Great War raging, Anglophones were insulted by the comparison. The restriction on French- language schools contributed to the Francophones turning away from the war effort in 1915 and refusing to enlist. But, most of Ontario&#x27;s Catholics were Irish, led by Irish Bishop Fallon, who united with the Protestants in opposing French schools. The government repealed Regulation 17 in 1927. Ontario has no official language, but English is considered the &quot;de facto&quot; language. Numerous French language services are available under the &quot;French Language Services Act&quot; of 1990 in designated areas where sizable francophone populations exist.

===World War I===
The British element strongly supported the war with men, money and enthusiasm. So too did the Francophone element until it reversed position in 1915. Given Germany as one of the Axis Powers, the Canadian government was suspicious of the loyalty of residents of German descent, and anti-German sentiment escalated in the country. The City of Berlin was renamed Kitchener after Britain&#x27;s top commander. Left-wing anti-war activists also came under attack. In 1917–1918 Isaac Bainbridge of Toronto, the dominion secretary of the Social Democratic Party of Canada and editor of its newspaper, &quot;Canadian Forward&quot;, was charged three times with seditious libel and once with possession of seditious material; he was imprisoned twice.

===1920s===
Premier Hearst had a number of progressive ideas planned for his next term, but his Conservatives were swept from power in 1919 by a totally new farmer&#x27;s party. The United Farmers of Ontario, with 45 seats, formed a bare majority coalition with the trades union party, known as the &quot;Ontario Independent Labour Party&quot;, with 11 seats. They selected farm leader Ernest Drury as premier, enforced prohibition, passed a mother&#x27;s pension and minimum wage which Hearst had proposed, and promoted good roads in the rural areas. The farmers and unionists did not get along well. The 1923 election reflected a popular move to the right, with the Conservatives winning 50% of the vote and 75 seats of the 111 seats, making George Howard Ferguson premier.

When surveys of public health showed infant mortality rates were high in Ontario, particularly in the more rural and isolated areas, the provincial government teamed with middle-class public health reformers to take action. They launched an educational campaign to teach mothers to save and improve the lives of infants and young children, with the long-range goal of uplifting the average Canadian family.

====Prohibition====

Starting in the late 1870s the Ontario Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) urged public schools to teach &quot;scientific temperance&quot; as a compulsory subject; it reinforced moralistic messages with the study of anatomy and hygiene. Although the WCTU was initially successful in convincing the Ontario Department of Education to adopt scientific temperance as part of the curriculum, teachers opposed the plan and refused to implement it. The WCTU reacted with an attempt to reduce alcohol sales and use in the province through government action. They started with &quot;local option&quot; laws, which allowed local governments to prohibit the sale of liquor. Many towns and rural areas went dry in the years before 1914, but not the larger cities.

Anti-German sentiment after 1914 and the accession of Conservative William Hearst to the premiership made prohibition a major political issue, as many residents associated beer production and drinking with Germans. The Methodists and Baptists (but not the Anglicans or Catholics) demanded the province be made dry. The government introduced prohibition of alcoholic sales in 1916 with the &quot;Ontario Temperance Act&quot;. However, drinking itself was never illegal, and residents could distill and retain their own personal supply. As major liquor producers could continue distillation and export for sale, Ontario became a centre for the illegal smuggling of liquor into the United States. The latter passed complete prohibition, effective after 1920. The &quot;drys&quot; won a referendum in 1919. Prohibition was ended in 1927 with the Conservative establishment of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.

However, the government still controls the sale and consumption of liquor, wine, and beer to ensure compliance with strict community standards and to generate revenue from the alcohol retail monopoly. In April 2007, Ontario Minister of Provincial Parliament Kim Craitor suggested that local brewers should be able to sell their beer in local corner stores; however, the motion was quickly rejected by Premier Dalton McGuinty.

===Great Depression===

Agriculture and industry alike suffered in the Great Depression in Canada; hardest hit were the lumbering regions, the auto plants, and the steel mills. The milk industry suffered from price wars that hurt both dairy farmers and dairies. The government set up the Ontario Milk Control Board (MCB), which raised and stabilized prices through licensing, bonding, and fixed price agreements. The MCB resolved the crisis for the industry, but consumers complained loudly about higher prices. The government favoured producers over consumers as the industry rallied behind the MCB.

Following a massive defeat in 1934 by the Liberals, the Conservatives reorganized over the next decade. Led by pragmatic leaders Cecil Frost, George Drew, Alex McKenzie, and Fred Gardiner, they minimized internal conflicts, quietly dropped laissez-faire positions, and opted in favour of state intervention to deal with the Great Depression and encourage economic growth. The revised party declared loyalty to the Empire, called for comprehensive health care and pension programs, and sought more provincial autonomy. The reforms set the stage for a long run of election wins from 1943 onward.

===Late 20th century===
After World War II, Ontario grew more in population. The Greater Toronto Area in particular has been the destination of most immigration to Canada, largely immigrants from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. After changes in federal immigration law in 1967, most immigrants come from Asia. In terms of ancestry, Ontario has changed from a largely ethnically British province, to one that is very diverse.

Toronto replaced Montreal as the nation&#x27;s premier business centre because the nationalist movement in Quebec, particularly with the success of the Parti Québécois in 1976, systematically drove Anglophone business away. Depressed economic conditions in the Maritime Provinces have also resulted in de-population of those provinces in the 20th century, with heavy migration into Ontario.

====Politics====
The Ontario Progressive Conservative Party held power in the province from 1943 until 1985 by occupying the political centre and isolating both the Left and Right, at a time when Liberals most often controlled the national government in Ottawa.

By contrast the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), which rebranded itself as the New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1961, was in the doldrums after the war. Its best showing was in 1948 when it elected 21 MPPs, and formed the official opposition. Purists said its decline resulted from a loss of Socialist purity and abandonment of the founding left-wing principles of the movement and party. They said democratic socialist activity in terms of activism, youth training, and volunteerism was lost in favour of authoritarian political bureaucracy. Moderates said the decline demonstrated the need for cooperation with Liberals. Political scientists said the party lacked the more coherent organizational base it needed to survive.

The NDP routinely captured 20-some percent of the vote. In its surprise win in 1990, the NDP took 38% of the vote, won 75 of the 120 seats, and formed a government under Bob Rae. He served as premier but Ontario&#x27;s labour unions, the backbone of the NDP, were outraged when Rae imposed pay cuts on unionized public workers. The NDP was defeated in 1995, falling back to 21% of the vote. Rae quit the NDP in 1998, describing it as too leftist, and joined the Liberals.

====Women&#x27;s labour laws====
Ontario&#x27;s &quot;Fair Employment Practices Act&quot; combatted racist and religious discrimination after the Second World War, but it did not cover gender issues. Most human rights activists did not raise the issue before the 1970s, because they were family oriented and subscribed to the deeply embedded ideology of the family wage, whereby the husband should be paid enough so the wife could be a full-time housewife. After lobbying by women, labour unions, and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), the Conservative government passed the &quot;Female Employees Fair Remuneration Act&quot; in 1951. It required equal pay for women who did the same work as men. Feminists in the 1950s and 1960s were unsuccessful trying to gain passage of a law to prohibit other forms of sex discrimination, such as in hiring and promotion. The enforcement of both acts was constrained by their conciliatory framework. Provincial officials interpreted the equal pay act quite narrowly, and were significantly more diligent in tackling racist and religious employment discrimination.

===Issues during the 20th century===
====Conservation and museums====
Early efforts in the preservation of natural resources began with the passage of the &quot;Public Parks Act&quot; in 1883, which called for public parks in every town and city. Algonquin Provincial Park, the first provincial park, was established in 1893. However, the creation of the provincial Department of Planning and Development did not take place until 1944; which brought conservation offices throughout the province and made for an integrated approach. The conservation authorities started to create heritage museums, but that ended in the 1970s when responsibility was shifted to the new ministry of Culture and Recreation. Repeated budget cuts in the 1980s and 1990s reduced the operation of many museums and historical sites.

====Economy====

Mineral exploitation accelerated in the late 19th century, leading to the rise of important mining centres in the northeast like Sudbury, Cobalt, and Timmins.

Energy policy focused on hydro-electric power, leading to the formation in 1906 of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario (HEPC), renamed Ontario Hydro in 1974. HEPC was a unique hybrid of a government department, a Crown corporation, and a municipal cooperative that coexisted with the existing private companies. It was a &quot;politically rational&quot; rather than a &quot;technically efficient&quot; solution that depended on the watershed election of 1905 when the main issue became &quot;Niagara Power&quot;. The Conservative slogan was &quot;water power of Niagara should be free&quot;.

The Conservatives replaced the Liberals and set up HEPC. In 1908 HEPC began purchasing electricity from Niagara Falls. In the next decade it purchased most of the privately owned distribution systems and built an integrated network. The availability of cheap electric power stimulated the development of industry. The Ford Motor Company of Canada of Canada was established in 1904. General Motors Canada was formed in 1918. The motor vehicle industry became by 1920 the most productive industry in Ontario and a customer for smaller suppliers.

Entrepreneurship was exemplified by the career of John Northway (1848–1926). Beginning as a tailor in a small town, he moved to Toronto and soon developed a chain of department stores. His innovations in the sewing and marketing of ladies&#x27; wear stimulated the rise of a Canadian ladies&#x27; garment industry. Northway pioneered modern business and accounting methods. He innovated as well in labour relations, as a pioneer in sickness and accident compensation and profit-sharing schemes. A millionaire by 1910, he played a leading role in Toronto&#x27;s civic life.

====Modernization====
=====Legal and police reform=====

The construction of roads and canals depended on numerous workers, whose wages often went to liquor, gambling, and women, all causes for fighting and rowdiness. Community leaders realized the traditional method of dealing with troublemakers one by one was inadequate, and they began to adopt less personal modernized procedures that followed imperial models of policing, trial, and punishment through the courts.

Toronto, Hamilton, Berlin (Kitchener), Windsor and other cities modernized and professionalized their public services in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. No service was changed more dramatically than the police. The introduction of emergency telephone call boxes linked to a central dispatcher, plus the use of bicycles, motorcycles, and automobiles, shifted the patrolman&#x27;s duties from passively walking the beat to fast reaction to reported incidents, as well as handling automobile traffic. After 1930 the introduction of police radios speeded response times.

=====Medicine=====
Once they had taken control of the practice of medicine, the doctors on the Medical Council of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) turned their attention to the quality of medical education in the province. Marginal and untrained practitioners were banned, but the question rose of the permanence and the quality of proprietary for-profit medical schools. CPSO-imposed regulations in the 1860s to increase faculty size and raise matriculation standards. They required students to take Council-administered examinations. Toronto had two medical schools – Trinity Medical School and the Toronto School of Medicine (TSM). During the 1880s the TSM added instructors, expanded its curriculum, and focused on clinical instruction. Enrollments grew at both schools. Critics found proprietary schools lacking, especially for their failure to offer sufficient instruction in the basic sciences.

In 1887, the TSM became the medical faculty of the University of Toronto, increasing its emphasis on research within the medical curriculum. Trinity realized that its survival depended as well on close ties to basic science, and in 1904 it also merged into the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine. In 1923 University of Toronto researchers John Macleod (1876–1935) and Frederick Banting (1891–1941) won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their 1921 discovery of insulin, putting Toronto on the world map of leading science.

=====Transportation=====

The rapid spread of automobiles after 1910 and the building of roads, especially after 1920, opened up opportunities in remote rural areas to travel to the towns and cities for shopping and services. City people moved outward to suburbs. By the 1920s it was common for city folk to have a vacation cottage in remote lake areas. A stretch of the Queen Elizabeth Way (&quot;QEW&quot;) opened in 1939, becoming one of world&#x27;s first controlled-access highways. The trend of city dwellers opening vacation cottages surged after 1945. It brought new money into remote areas, while also bringing negative environmental impacts and occasional conflict between cottagers and the permanent residents.

==21st century Ontario==
From the late 20th century to the early 21st century, Ontario received the largest number of immigrants in its history. Many of these immigrants came to concentrate themselves in Toronto and Brampton. From 2020 to 2021, Ontario&#x27;s government and population dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>MTR Corporation Limited is a majority government-owned public transport operator and property developer in Hong Kong which operates the Mass Transit Railway, the most popular public transport network in Hong Kong. It is listed on the Hong Kong Exchange and is a component of the Hang Seng Index. The MTR additionally invests in railways across different parts of the world, including franchised contracts to operate rapid transit systems in London, Stockholm, Beijing, Hangzhou, Macao, Shenzhen, Sydney, and a suburban rail system in Melbourne.

==History==
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation () was established on 22 September 1972 as a government-owned statutory corporation to build and operate a mass transit railway system to meet Hong Kong&#x27;s public transport needs. On 30 June 2000, the MTRC was succeeded by the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL, ). As with the MTRC, the MTRCL&#x27;s principal business is to operate the mass transit railway system. Following a successful initial public offering, the MTRCL was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 5 October 2000, however, the government is still the majority stakeholder in the MTRCL.

===Partial privatisation===
On 11 September 2000, the financial secretary of the Hong Kong Government, Sir Donald Tsang, announced the partial privatisation of MTR Corporation Limited. The offering was for one billion shares, but this was increased to 1.15 billion due to high demand. On 5 October 2000, the company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with 600,000 shareholders. In June 2001, MTR was added to the Hang Seng Index.

At the time of the initial public offering, the company was operating with a surplus of HK$360 million (US$46.1 million), which had increased from a surplus of HK$278 million (US$35.6 million) in 1997. The MTR has continued to be one of the few profitable public transport systems in the world.

===MTR–KCR merger===

There had been some discussion of merging the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC), which was also government-owned and the MTRCL to make the territory&#x27;s transport system more efficient. The MTRCL backed such a merger while the KCRC opposed the plan. In March 2004, the Hong Kong Government officially encouraged the two companies to merge.

On 11 April 2006, the Hong Kong Government officially announced the details of the proposed merger. Under the non-binding Memorandum of Understanding the government has signed with KCRC, KCRC would grant a service concession to the MTRCL to operate the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR) system, with an initial period of 50 years. The KCRC would receive a one-time upfront payment of HK$4.25 billion, a fixed annual payment of HK$750 million and a variable annual payment based on revenues generated from operation of the KCR system. In addition, MTRCL would make a payment of $7.79 billion for the acquisition of property and other related commercial interests.

The KCRC&#x27;s lines were less profitable than those of the MTRC, and the KCRC was less active in property development. It was widely considered that the government&#x27;s choice was to avoid being criticised for selling assets of the KCRC, which it wholly owned, to MTRCL for an unreasonably low price. Leasing the operation rights of the KCR system to the MTRCL avoided actually selling the KCRC.

On 2 December 2007, the Chinese name of the MTRCL was changed to ( &quot;Hong Kong Railway Corporation Limited&quot;) after being granted the Service Concession while the English name will remain unchanged. The KCRC is now a holding company of the KCR system, without actual railway operations. The merger was approved by shareholders of the MTRCL on 9 October 2007. The merger is effective for 50 years. This also resulted in changing the system&#x27;s Chinese name from &quot;&quot; (&quot;Subway&quot;) to &quot;&quot; &quot;(Hong Kong Railway&quot;).

All adult Octopus Card holders would be the first to benefit from the merger. Student and concessionary Octopus holders would also benefit from the merger by further reducing $0.1 from their 50% off fares. Student Octopus holders would continue to pay the current reduced concessionary fares on the MTR network. Elderly Octopus holders would be introduced to a new fare system which only the elderly can enjoy a $2 fare to anywhere on the MTR network (excluding Airport Express, Light Rail, and Cross-Boundary Stations).

=== Revenue model ===
In July 2021, Liber Research Community, an NGO, produced a report which detailed the history of MTR&#x27;s revenue model. In it, it reported that the &quot;Rail + Property&quot; development model was originally formed to offset unexpected financial difficulties with creating the original MTR lines, with original estimates that MTR&#x27;s property would account for approximately 20 per cent of its total revenue.

The Executive Council also determined that since MTR had to apply for land grants from the government, it was the government&#x27;s decision on how land above MTR stations should be allocated, stating &quot;the grant of comprehensive development rights on land affected by railway installations will be discretionary&quot;. Land above stations would not necessarily be used to build private housing to maximize MTR&#x27;s revenue, but could be used to solve issues of housing in Hong Kong, such as by developing public housing instead. The Executive Council also noted that &quot;revenue from property development was not originally envisaged as being used as a means of financing the capital cost of the railway itself&quot; and that revenue from property development was to be used for a &quot;contingency reserve&quot;, such as for offsetting excessive construction costs.

The report noted that as of 2017, 40 per cent of MTR&#x27;s revenue is from property and that the original intent of using property revenue for contingency purposes had shifted into a different, unsustainable model where property is used to subsidise operations and the construction of new stations.

==Operations by market==
===Hong Kong===

On 5 October 2000 the operator of the MTR network, the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC), became Hong Kong&#x27;s first rail company to be partially privatised, marking the beginning of the Hong Kong government&#x27;s initiative to reduce its interests in public utilities. Prior to its listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) was wholly owned by the Hong Kong government. MTR Corporation is responsible for the operation of MTR (and the Kowloon–Canton Railway since 2 December 2007). The rail lines are profitable, but the MTR Corporation derives most of its profits from property development (usually adjacent to railway stations) and other commercial activities in Hong Kong, including the letting of retail and poster advertising space, ATM banking facilities, and personal telecommunication services .

====Rail services====

Mass Transit Railway (MTR) is the rapid transit railway system in Hong Kong. Originally opened in 1979, the system currently (at September 2024) includes of rail with 167 stations, including 99 railway stations and 68 light rail stops. There are also several future projects.
====Property management====

Property is one of the main businesses of the MTR, generating most of its profits. In 2009, with a net profit of HK$7.3 billion, MTR made HK$3.55 billion from property and HK$2.12 billion from transport operations. The MTR tries to develop suitable sites related to their new railway projects and their existing railway. For instance, the reclaimed land situated in West Kowloon owned by the MTR was developed into Union Square, a mixed-use development with residential, office, retail, and hotel space. The site includes the tallest commercial building in Hong Kong, the 118-storey International Commerce Centre. 

Central&#x27;s landmark International Finance Centre is managed by Premier Plus, MTR&#x27;s elite property management brand.

=====Shopping centres=====

The MTR Corporation invested heavily to develop large shopping centres around MTR stations. The most recent example is the PopCorn mall located at Tseung Kwan O station. It is connected to the adjacent malls, high-end housing and hotels. Another example of such a shopping centre is Maritime Square located at Tsing Yi station. Maritime Square is a nautical-themed mall in which there are supermarkets, boutiques, bookstores, a cinema, and restaurants. Since Tsing Yi station serves as the transport hub for Tsing Yi, Maritime Square is also easily accessible by other transport means including buses and taxis. Other shopping centres developed and managed by the corporation include CityLink, Elements, Hanford Plaza, Ocean Walk, Paradise Mall, Plaza Ascot, Sun Tuen Mun Shopping Centre, Telford Plaza, The Lane, the LOHAS, and Luk Yeung Galleria.

As of 2023, MTR Corporation owns 13 shopping malls across Hong Kong, classified into luxury, regional, and neighbourhood malls.

===United Kingdom===
====Current operations====
*Elizabeth line: In May 2015, TfL Rail began an eight-year contract to operate the Crossrail concession in London, with an option for a further two years. Before the new railway lines opened, MTR already operated Liverpool Street–Shenfield and Paddington–Heathrow Airport services branded as TfL Rail.

<text>Ronald Franklin Asheton (July 17, 1948 – January 6, 2009) was an American musician, who was best known as the guitarist, bassist, and co-songwriter for the rock band the Stooges. He formed the Stooges along with Iggy Pop and his brother, drummer Scott Asheton, and bassist Dave Alexander. Asheton, once ranked as number 29 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, is currently (as of December 2015) ranked at number 60.

== Early life ==
Ronald Franklin Asheton was born July 17, 1948, in Washington, D.C. He described his household as heavily musical, and described his family as his first big musical influence. His first instrument was a violin which was given by his mother, he was then gifted an accordion at age 5, of which he practiced more seriously with. At age 10 he took up both guitar and bass which ultimately took the majority of his practice time and interest.

He described himself as a child different compared to others kids his age, as a majority of kids that lived in his area were more interested in sports and physical activities, while he spent his time listening to music and practicing on guitar and bass. When he was 13, the family relocated to Ann Arbor, Michigan. He and his brother Scott attended Pioneer High School.

He played with some local bands including the Prime Movers and The Chosen Few (briefly overlapping with James Williamson, later of the Stooges). He met Iggy Pop soon after and they formed the hard rock band the Stooges. Like his father who was a Marine, Ron had a strong interest in military history, including a controversial albeit apolitical obsession with collecting Nazi memorabilia.
==The Stooges==

By 1967, Asheton was jamming with his brother Scott and friend Dave Alexander. They were soon joined by James &quot;Iggy&quot; Osterberg who remembered Asheton from the Chosen Few. The &quot;Psychedelic Stooges&quot; played their first show Halloween 1967. In 1968 they were signed to Elektra Records along with MC5 by Danny Fields. He played guitar on and wrote most of the music for their first two albums, debut album &quot;The Stooges&quot; (1969) and &quot;Fun House&quot; (1970). Shortly after recording &quot;Fun House&quot;, a second guitarist was added to the band, initially former roadie Bill Cheatham, who was shortly thereafter replaced by James Williamson. Infighting between Asheton and Williamson, whom he saw as usurping his role as songwriter and lead guitarist, as well as the toll of extensive drug use, caused the band to break up in 1971.

In 1972, David Bowie invited Pop and Williamson to London to reform the band and record a new album. Eventually, after being unable to find suitable local replacements, Pop invited the Asheton brothers to rejoin but with Ron on bass, a role Ron accepted only begrudgingly. The resulting album, &quot;Raw Power&quot;, sold poorly initially, but has since been seen as a seminal album in the development of what would later be called punk rock. Tensions and drug use had not gone away during the brief reunion, however, and the band would disintegrate again in February, 1974. Several more releases continued sporadically during the next several decades, mostly recordings of live shows, album remixes, and collections of unreleased recordings, but the Stooges would not tour or record again during the 20th century.

When the Stooges reformed in 2003 he once again appeared as the band&#x27;s guitarist. He stayed with the band until his death and was replaced by Williamson.

==Post-Stooges==

Apart from The Stooges, Asheton also played in the bands The New Order (not the UK band New Order), Destroy All Monsters, Dark Carnival, New Race and The Empty Set.

More recently he played with Wylde Ratttz, a band composed of some of punk and alt-rock&#x27;s most renowned and respected musicians. The band included Mike Watt of Minutemen, J. Mascis of Dinosaur Jr., Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, and Mark Arm of Mudhoney. It contributed a cover version of the Stooges song &quot;T.V. Eye&quot; to the soundtrack for the Todd Haynes film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, which starred Ewan McGregor and Jonathan Rhys Meyers. Asheton&#x27;s final song &quot;3 Stooges&quot; appeared during the credits of the 2012 comedy film &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;.

Asheton also acted, appearing with &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; star Gunnar Hansen in &quot;Mosquito&quot;, which was released 1995. He also appeared in two other films: &quot;&quot; and &quot;Legion of the Night&quot;.

Following the band&#x27;s 1974 breakup, Asheton returned to Ann Arbor and spent most of the rest of his life living with his mother.

==Death==

During the early hours of January 6, 2009, police were summoned to Asheton&#x27;s home in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by his personal assistant, who had been unable to reach him for several days. Asheton was found dead in his bed, apparently having died of a heart attack. Sonic Youth&#x27;s album &quot;The Eternal&quot; is dedicated to him.

His brother Scott died on March 15, 2014, also from a heart attack.

On July 17, 2018, for what would have been Asheton&#x27;s 70th birthday, a tribute concert was held in his hometown of Ann Arbor, Michigan, featuring Mike Watt; Dinosaur Jr&#x27;s J Mascis; Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth and Free Kitten; Mark Arm of Mudhoney; Jennifer Herrema of Royal Trux; Mario Rubalcaba of Hot Snakes; and Don Fleming of Gumball.

<doc id="1110265" wikidata="Q2734911" url="?curid=1110265" title="Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works">
<text>Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works was a manufacturer of railroad steam locomotives based in Paterson, in Passaic County, New Jersey, in the United States. Between its founding in 1832 and its acquisition in 1905, the company built more than 6,000 steam locomotives for railroads around the world. Most 19th-century U.S. railroads owned at least one Rogers-built locomotive. The company&#x27;s most famous product was a locomotive named &quot;The General&quot;, built in December 1855, which was one of the principals of the Great Locomotive Chase of the American Civil War.

The company was founded by Thomas Rogers in an 1832 partnership with Morris Ketchum and Jasper Grosvenor as Rogers, Ketchum and Grosvenor. Rogers remained president until his death in 1856. His son, Jacob S. Rogers, reorganized the company as Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works and led the company until he retired in 1893. Robert S. Hughes then became president and reorganized the company as Rogers Locomotive Company, which he led until his death in 1900.

Rogers avoided the 1901 American Locomotive Company (ALCO) merger by closing and reopening as Rogers Locomotive Works, but the company&#x27;s independence lasted only until 1905, when ALCO purchased it. ALCO continued building new steam locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913 and used the Rogers facilities through the 1920s as a parts storage facility and warehouse. Eventually, ALCO sold the property to private investors. 

Today, several Rogers-built locomotives exist in railroad museums around the world, and the plant&#x27;s erecting shop is preserved as the Thomas Rogers Building; it is the current location of the Paterson Museum, whose mission is to preserve and display Paterson&#x27;s industrial history.

==1831 to 1856: Thomas Rogers era==
The firm that was to become Rogers Locomotive Works began in 1831. Thomas Rogers had been designing and building machinery for textile manufacturing for nearly 20 years when he sold his interest in Godwin, Rogers &amp; Company (of which he was the Rogers part of the name) in June of that year. Rogers set out on his own with a new company called Jefferson Works in Paterson, New Jersey. The Jefferson Works built textile and agricultural machinery for a year before Rogers met the two men who would help transform the company into a major locomotive manufacturer.

In 1832, Rogers partnered with two investors from New York City, Morris Ketchum and Jasper Grosvenor. Jefferson Works was renamed Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor, and the company began to diversify into the railroad industry. The company soon manufactured springs, axles and other small parts for railroad use.

The first locomotive that Rogers&#x27; company assembled was actually built by Robert Stephenson and Company of England in 1835. This locomotive was the &quot;McNeil&quot; for the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad. It took another two years before Rogers received its first order for a complete locomotive. In 1837, the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad ordered two locomotives from Rogers to form the beginning of the railroad&#x27;s roster. The first of these two locomotives was the &quot;Sandusky&quot;, which became the first locomotive to cross the Allegheny Mountains (albeit by canal boat and not by rail), and the first locomotive to operate in Ohio.

&quot;Sandusky&quot; included features designed by Thomas Rogers that had not been seen in locomotive construction to date. It was also the first locomotive to use cast iron driving wheels, and the wheels included built-in counterweights to reduce the amount of wear on the track caused by the weight of the driving rod and wheel all coming down at once during the wheels&#x27; rotations. Before &quot;Sandusky&quot;&#x27;s construction, driving wheels were typically built with wooden spokes, much like wagon wheels. Some accounts also state that &quot;Sandusky&quot; was the first locomotive to feature a whistle, but this has since been proven false.

Rogers was not working completely alone in American locomotive manufacturing. In 1837, in addition to building the company&#x27;s first locomotive, Rogers also filled orders from fellow locomotive builders Matthias W. Baldwin (founder of Baldwin Locomotive Works) and William Norris (founder of Norris Locomotive Works) for locomotive tires of various sizes. Once Rogers started working on his own locomotives, however, no further orders from either Baldwin or Norris were forthcoming.

Within Rogers&#x27; own shop, William Swinburne worked as the shop foreman until he moved on to form his own locomotive manufacturing company, Swinburne, Smith and Company in 1845. After Swinburne left Rogers, John Cooke also worked at the Rogers plant. Like Swinburne, Cooke later went on to form his own locomotive manufacturing firm, Danforth, Cooke &amp; Company. Another engineer who worked at Rogers was Zerah Colburn, the well known locomotive engineer and, later editor and publisher. Colburn was, around 1854, &quot;superintendent and/or consultant&quot; at the works where he introduced a number of improvements in locomotive design. His assistant was William S. Hudson who succeeded Rogers after he died in 1856, and was responsible for further engineering enhancement. Hudson would remain with Rogers until his own death in 1881.
Rogers locomotives were, from very early in the company&#x27;s history, seen as powerful, capable engines on American railroads. The &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, serial number 11, a 4-2-0 (a locomotive with two unpowered axles in front, followed by one powered axle) built in 1839 for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company, was noted by &quot;American Railroad Journal&quot; for hauling a 24-car train up a grade of or 0.49% at . In 1846, Rogers built what is referred to as the largest 6-wheel truck engine (4-2-0) in the United States; the &quot;Licking&quot;, serial number 92, built for the Mansfield and Sandusky Railroad, generated of steam pressure and could pull a train up a grade of or 0.3%.

Arguably, the most famous locomotive to come out of the Rogers shops was built in 1855. Rogers built a 4-4-0, serial number 631, in December of that year for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. The railroad named the locomotive &quot;The General&quot;. This locomotive, best known for being at the heart of an American Civil War incident, is now on display at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History (the Big Shanty Museum) in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Not only were Rogers locomotives known in the industry for their power, but they were also known for their endurance. It is estimated that one locomotive, Illinois Central Railroad 4-4-0 number 23, serial number 449, built in December 1853, operated over one million miles () in its thirty-year career on the Illinois Central.

==1856 to 1905: Reorganization and decline==

When Thomas Rogers died in 1856, his son Jacob S. Rogers reorganized RK&amp;G, with Ketchum and Grosvenor remaining as investors, as the Rogers Locomotive &amp; Machine Works. Rogers built their first 2-6-0, which is sometimes referred to as the first 2-6-0 built in the United States, in 1863 for the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company. The company continued manufacturing both locomotives and textile machinery for nearly another 20 years.

In November 1868 Rogers delivered five identical coal-burning 4-4-0 steam locomotives (assigned Nos. 116–120) to the Union Pacific Railroad, which were subsequently placed into freight service in western Wyoming and Utah. Union Pacific No. 119 would gain fame on May 10, 1869, when it took part in the &quot;Golden Spike&quot; ceremony at Promontory, Utah, to celebrate the completion of the First transcontinental railroad. The unit was rebuilt in the early 1880s, and redesignated as road No. 343 in 1885. No. 119 was retired and sent to the scrapyard after nearly 35 years of service in April 1903. A full-scale, operating replica was completed in 1979, and now is part of an operational display at the Golden Spike National Historic Site.

In 1870, Rogers was involved in a suit against Jay Gould, James Fisk Jr., William H. Rasson and C. V. Nason alleging that Rogers was charged unreasonable freight rates when delivering their products; the court decided in favor of Rogers, delivering indictments against the four men. In the mid-1870s, Rogers ended production of textile machinery and began concentrating solely on locomotive manufacturing. Rogers customers of the mid-19th century continued purchasing their locomotives. The Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) purchased so many locomotives from the company that the railroad was given a free locomotive as a thank-you bonus in 1879.

Reuben Wells was appointed as shop superintendent in 1887. Jacob Rogers, now in his late 70s, gradually passed more and more responsibility to Wells until Rogers resigned the presidency in 1893. The company was then reorganized as the Rogers Locomotive Company. After just over 60 years, the Rogers company would no longer be run by a member of the Rogers family. The company reorganized under its former treasurer and new president, Robert S. Hughes, as the Rogers Locomotive Company; Jacob Rogers remained the company&#x27;s principal investor. Hughes led the company until his own death in 1900. A year later, Jacob Rogers closed the Rogers Locomotive Company plant.

In 1901, the year that Jacob Rogers died and the same year that the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) was formed through the merger of eight other locomotive manufacturers, the company reopened as the Rogers Locomotive Works. Reuben Wells was again the shop superintendent, but the firm was at a competitive disadvantage. Not enough capital investment was made to purchase new equipment or in research and development. ALCO and Baldwin, the largest locomotive manufacturers in North America, held too much of a lead in manufacturing and selling their own locomotives for Rogers to keep up. Compounding Rogers&#x27; troubles further, the firm had no nearby rail connection, the closest railroad, Erie Railroad, being located approximately to the east, making transporting materials and locomotives time-consuming, increasingly more so as the surrounding city of Patterson was built up and larger engines were ordered.

==1905 to present: absorbed into ALCO==
Faced with stiff competition and an inability to increase its own capacity, Rogers Locomotive Works was purchased by ALCO in 1905. Rogers&#x27; last independently built locomotive was serial number 6271, a 0-6-0 tank locomotive built for W. R. Grace &amp; Company in February 1905. ALCO continued building locomotives at the Rogers plant until 1913 when manufacturing at the plant ceased permanently. Locomotives built at the Rogers plant under ALCO are generally referred to as locomotives built by ALCO-Rogers. ALCO used the Rogers plant buildings as warehouses well into the 1920s, but eventually sold off all of the property. The original Rogers erecting shop was converted into office space and was still in use in that manner as late as 1992.

The erecting shop building has since been renamed the &quot;Thomas Rogers Building&quot; and is now the home of the Paterson Museum. The museum preserves and displays artifacts of Paterson&#x27;s industrial history. A 2-6-0 locomotive that was used in the construction of the Panama Canal is on display outside the museum, but it is one that was built by ALCO-Cooke (the former Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works plant, also located in Paterson) and not by Rogers.

==Preserved Rogers locomotives==
The following locomotives (in serial number order) built by Rogers, before ALCO&#x27;s acquisition of the company, have been preserved. Where multiple railroads and road numbers are listed, they are given in chronological order for the locomotives; all locations are in the United States unless noted.

The following locomotives (in serial number order) built since ALCO&#x27;s acquisition of the company have been preserved...

<doc id="1110270" wikidata="Q133594" url="?curid=1110270" title="Plastoquinone">
<text>Plastoquinone (PQ) is a terpenoid-quinone (meroterpenoid) molecule involved in the electron transport chain in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. The most common form of plastoquinone, known as PQ-A or PQ-9, is a 2,3-dimethyl-1,4-benzoquinone molecule with a side chain of nine isoprenyl units. There are other forms of plastoquinone, such as ones with shorter side chains like PQ-3 (which has 3 isoprenyl side units instead of 9) as well as analogs such as PQ-B, PQ-C, and PQ-D, which differ in their side chains. The benzoquinone and isoprenyl units are both nonpolar, anchoring the molecule within the inner section of a lipid bilayer, where the hydrophobic tails are usually found.

Plastoquinones are very structurally similar to ubiquinone, or coenzyme Q10, differing by the length of the isoprenyl side chain, replacement of the methoxy groups with methyl groups, and removal of the methyl group in the 2 position on the quinone. Like ubiquinone, it can come in several oxidation states: plastoquinone, plastosemiquinone (unstable), and plastoquinol, which differs from plastoquinone by having two hydroxyl groups instead of two carbonyl groups.

Plastoquinol, the reduced form, also functions as an antioxidant by reducing reactive oxygen species, some produced from the photosynthetic reactions, that could harm the cell membrane. One example of how it does this is by reacting with superoxides to form hydrogen peroxide and plastosemiquinone.
The prefix &quot;plasto-&quot; means either plastid or chloroplast, alluding to its location within the cell.

== Role in photosynthesis ==

The role that plastoquinone plays in photosynthesis, more specifically in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, is that of a mobile electron carrier through the membrane of the thylakoid.

Plastoquinone is reduced when it accepts two electrons from photosystem II and two hydrogen cations (H+) from the stroma of the chloroplast, thereby forming plastoquinol (PQH2). It transfers the electrons further down the electron transport chain to plastocyanin, a mobile, water-soluble electron carrier, through the cytochrome &quot;b&quot;6&quot;f&quot; protein complex. The cytochrome &quot;b&quot;6&quot;f&quot; protein complex catalyzes the electron transfer between plastoquinone and plastocyanin, but also transports the two protons into the lumen of thylakoid discs. This proton transfer forms an electrochemical gradient, which is used by ATP synthase at the end of the light dependent reactions in order to form ATP from ADP and Pi.

=== Within photosystem II ===
Plastoquinone is found within photosystem II in two specific binding sites, known as QA and QB. The plastoquinone at QA, the primary binding site, is very tightly bound, compared to the plastoquinone at QB, the secondary binding site, which is much more easily removed. QA is only transferred a single electron, so it has to transfer an electron to QB twice before QB is able to pick up two protons from the stroma and be replaced by another plastoquinone molecule. The protonated QB then joins a pool of free plastoquinone molecules in the membrane of the thylakoid. The free plastoquinone molecules eventually transfer electrons to the water-soluble plastocyanin so as to continue the light-dependent reactions. There are additional plastoquinone binding sites within photosystem II (QC and possibly QD), but their function and/or existence have not been fully elucidated.

== Biosynthesis ==
The p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate is synthesized from tyrosine, while the solanesyl diphosphate is synthesized through the MEP/DOXP pathway. Homogentisate is formed from p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and is then combined with solanesyl diphosphate through a condensation reaction. The resulting intermediate, 2-methyl-6-solanesyl-1,4-benzoquinol is then methylated to form the final product, plastoquinol-9. This pathway is used in most photosynthetic organisms, like algae and plants. However, cyanobacteria appear to not use homogentisate for synthesizing plastoquinol, possibly resulting in a pathway different from the one shown below.

==Derivatives==
Some derivatives that were designed to penetrate mitochondrial cell membranes (SkQ1 (plastoquinonyl-decyl-triphenylphosphonium), SkQR1 (the rhodamine-containing analog of SkQ1), SkQ3) have anti-oxidant and protonophore activity. SkQ1 has been proposed as an anti-aging treatment, with the possible reduction of age-related vision issues due to its antioxidant ability. This antioxidant ability results from both its antioxidant ability to reduce reactive oxygen species (derived from the part of the molecule containing plastoquinonol), which are often formed within mitochondria, as well as its ability to increase ion exchange across membranes (derived from the part of the molecule containing cations that can dissolve within membranes). Specifically, like plastoquinol, SkQ1 has been shown to scavenge superoxides both within cells (in vivo) and outside of cells (in vitro). SkQR1 and SkQ1 have also been proposed as a possible way to treat brain issues like Alzheimer&#x27;s due to their ability to potentially fix damages caused by amyloid beta. Additionally, SkQR1 has been shown as a way to reduce the issues caused by brain trauma through its antioxidant abilities, which help prevent cell death signals by reducing the amounts of reactive oxygen species coming from mitochondria.

<text>Eckerd College is a private liberal arts college in St. Petersburg, Florida, United States. Founded in 1958, part of the campus is waterfront and beach on Boca Ciega Bay. Because of its location, Eckerd is considered a &quot;beach school&quot; and has its own student volunteer maritime search and rescue team. Accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools, Eckerd is a member of the Annapolis and Oberlin groups of national liberal arts colleges.

==History==
The institution now known as Eckerd College was founded as Florida Presbyterian College in 1958 as part of national growth in post-secondary education driven by GIs entering college after returning from World War II and later by the baby boom. The United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. and the Presbyterian Church worked together to establish the college, receiving a charter from the Florida legislature in 1958 and opening in 1960. The college opened in temporary quarters at Bayboro Harbor with a liberal arts focus and 154 freshmen; it had 310 freshmen and sophomores in January 1962, when it was about to expand with the addition of a junior class, and began the 1966–1967 academic year with 810 students. In 1971, drugstore magnate Jack Eckerd donated $12.5 million to the college as part of his broader interest in Florida politics. The following year the institution&#x27;s name was changed to Eckerd College. Ruth Eckerd Hall, a 2,100-seat regional performing arts venue for concerts, plays and civic events in nearby Clearwater, also benefited from Eckerd&#x27;s philanthropy, and is named for Jack Eckerd&#x27;s wife. Eckerd would serve as interim president of the college. Despite the name change from Florida Presbyterian, a covenant relationship is still maintained with the Presbyterian Church, and conferred degrees have the text &quot;founded in 1958 as Florida Presbyterian College&quot; in the official seal.

In the 1980s, college president Peter H. Armacost decided to spend much of the college&#x27;s endowment on real estate development — specifically, building waterfront homes and a retirement center on college-owned land next to the main campus. In 2000, the Board of Trustees discovered that more than half of Eckerd&#x27;s endowment had been spent without its knowledge or consent. Armacost abruptly retired, the college&#x27;s vice president for finance resigned, and the college itself eventually lost the partially developed land. Armacost&#x27;s retirement was met with controversy from both faculty and alumni, and despite the scandal, the main library on campus still bears Armacost&#x27;s name. In February 2004, the college announced that it had regained solvency.

Despite this, one of the first challenges Armacost&#x27;s replacement, Donald R. Eastman III, faced was having the institution warned that it might lose its accreditation because of these financial problems. Partially in response, in May 2006, Miles Collier, then-chairman of the Board of Trustees, and his wife, Parker Collier, announced a $25 million challenge gift to the college; they subsequently increased this to $40 million. In November 2008, alumnus Grover Wrenn, a member of the founding Class of 1964, gave the college a $1 million gift, the largest at the time from an alumnus.

Eastman&#x27;s position at Eckerd became the second-longest of any president at the college. Although later in his tenure he came under criticism for statements about campus sexual assault, Eastman is still credited with doubling applications for admission to Eckerd, providing more student housing, and improving the college&#x27;s stature after its financial scandal.

Eastman was succeeded by Damián J. Fernández in July 2020.

In the fall semester of 2021, Eckerd had 718 first-year and transfer students, its largest incoming class yet.

==Academics==
Eckerd College is accredited to award Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees in more than forty majors, or students can design their own concentrations. Its most popular majors, based on 2021 graduates, were:
*Marine Biology and Biological Oceanography (76)
*Biology/Biological Sciences (57)
*Environmental Studies (50)
*Psychology (35)
*Development and Child Psychology (20)

Every student takes four years of classes across a wide variety of fields—art, literature, the natural and social sciences—regardless of their major. Often called General Education, these courses are designed to provide critical thought, the ability to make complex decisions and a commitment to lifelong learning. Every student is required to complete a set number of hours of &quot;reflective service-learning&quot; before graduation. New students take their first college course during a three-week orientation called &quot;Autumn Term&quot; that is guided by faculty and peer mentors.

Eckerd College originated the 4-1-4 academic calendar, with the &quot;1&quot; representing the Winter Term during the month of January, in which each student concentrates on a single class, often studying abroad. Before graduation, students in nearly all majors are required to either pass a senior-year comprehensive examination or to complete a senior thesis project. All students must complete a senior seminar course in their final year.

As there are no graduate programs, all undergraduate students have access to research opportunities including first-year research associateships, the Ford Apprentice Scholars Program (launched by a grant from the Ford Foundation), honor societies, an honors program and an annual research symposium. Notable projects include the Eckerd College Dolphin Project, the longest running undergraduate-centered dolphin research program in the world., and D.A.R.W.I.N., a computer science project (partnered closely with marine science) to automate dolphin dorsal fin recognition. A United States Geological Survey center in St. Petersburg provides further research opportunities. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) received a $6.7 million grant in 2021 to design and construct a new Marine Mammal Pathobiology Lab on Eckerd&#x27;s campus to augment the lab currently owned and operated by FWC on Eckerd property just outside the college&#x27;s gates.

Phi Beta Kappa (Eckerd is one of the youngest colleges in the country to be awarded a chapter) and Sigma Xi are among the nationally recognized honor societies at Eckerd College. The Ethics Bowl teams have consistently captured awards in intercollegiate competition, winning the competition for seven straight years (2004–2011).

Students can study abroad, including at the Eckerd College Study Centre on London&#x27;s Gower Street, with scholarship opportunities. On average, students travel 1,000 miles from home to attend Eckerd—from roughly 48 states and 35 countries. Eckerd also offers short-term English-immersion courses in a dedicated campus facility.

==Campus==
Eckerd College has a suburban campus on Frenchman&#x27;s Creek and Boca Ciega Bay, about from Gulf of Mexico beaches. The campus is near residential and commercial neighborhoods of St. Petersburg.

The college has various sustainability efforts, including bikesharing systems and efforts to reduce plastic waste.

The school is ranked on the Princeton Review&#x27;s list of Green Colleges for its sustainability efforts.

In 1958, the founders of Eckerd College hired the Chicago architectural firm of Perkins and Will to design the college&#x27;s campus and first buildings. The result is one of the world&#x27;s largest intact collections of midcentury modern educational buildings designed by some of the 20th century&#x27;s most important school architects. A common feature is the use of glass and external views to emphasize a connection with the environment. Recent campus additions include the Armacost Library, Iota residential housing complex, sports facilities; renovations to the student center, residence halls, and Miller Auditorium were also completed. Other campus buildings include those designed and used for classrooms, laboratories, offices, conferences, theatrical productions, musical instruction, art exhibits, athletic events, and student services.

Armacost Library is a $15 million facility that opened in January 2005. The two-story library is located near the college&#x27;s student center and residence complexes. It houses book and periodical collections and features seating for about 400, including 17 group-study rooms and 58 computer stations. Both high-speed cable and wireless connectivity are available throughout the library.

In addition to aquarium rooms, a marine sediment core facility, an oceanography lab, and a computer lab, the Galbraith Marine Science Laboratory, which was renovated in 2014, features a continuous flow-through system that pumps seawater into the building, so students can study marine organisms without harming them.

The James Center For Molecular and Life Sciences, a , $25 million laboratory facility, opened in February 2013. On the western side of campus, the Doyle Sailing Center was completed in 2016 to become the new home for the Eckerd Sailing teams. In 2018, The Helmar and Enole Nielsen Center for Visual Arts opened at the cost of a U.S. $15 million. This 33,000-square-foot (3,066 m2) center nurtures art forms from ancient to contemporary to not-yet-invented. All three projects incorporate green initiatives and feature natural landscaping to accent the facilities.

== Peter H. Armacost Library ==

===Opening===
In March 2002, anonymous donors contributed $13 million, the largest donation ever given to the college, to establish the 58,000 square foot (5,388 square meters) 2-story library named for past president, Peter H. Armacost. Fox Hall was demolished to make room for the library. The donation was taken as a &quot;vote of confidence&quot; from Eckerd College donors after an endowment shortfall during the Armacost administration. It was later revealed that the donors involved were John and Rosemary Galbraith, a former Eckerd trustee and board chairman, as well as a retired mutual fund executive and philanthropist.

The library was planned to hold 300,000 books and be twice as large as the previous library at the Cobb center, opened in 1962. Construction of the library would be left to Ayers/Saint/Gross interdisciplinary design firm. The groundbreaking ceremony was held December 2002 with Armacost and his family in attendance. &quot;I am humbled and deeply grateful to those who made that possible,&quot; Armacost said in response to the library being named after him. During then Eckerd president Eastman&#x27;s speech, he said, &quot;This library, and the national reputation this college has achieved in the blink of an eye, are nothing less than dreams that have come true.&quot; With a Friends of the Library membership, the public would be able to borrow books for $30, $40 for families.

===Upgrades===
Since its opening, Armacost Library has had several changes to the building. In 2018, the Current, Eckerd&#x27;s campus newspaper, students were concerned about the lack of gender-neutral bathrooms in the library. As of 2022, construction was completed on gender-neutral bathrooms on the library&#x27;s first floor. In 2021, the first Seed Library was established within the Armacost Library.

== Student life and activities ==

Eckerd College maintains a regular series of on-campus events for the benefit and enjoyment of campus and community. The music, theatre, and visual arts programs are active in staging concerts, dramatic productions, and exhibitions, respectively, throughout the academic year. On-campus speakers have included, among many others, the late nobel laureate in economics Milton Friedman, the late Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban, Jimmy Carter, Michael Collins, Anderson Cooper, Jared Diamond, Gerald Ford, Jesse Jackson, Coretta Scott King, Stephen King, Henry Kissinger, Richard Leakey, Dennis Lehane (a 1988 Eckerd grad), Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Paul Rusesabagina, Peter Singer, James Van Allen, Elie Wiesel, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Gloria Steinem, Billy Collins, Bill McKibben, Piper Kerman, Opal Tometi, and Ibram X. Kendi.

Eckerd&#x27;s student government, the Eckerd College Organization of Students, gives an annual total of more than $500,000 to more than 100 student-run clubs and organizations, including Eckerd&#x27;s student newspaper (&quot;The Current&quot;), a student literary journal (&quot;Eckerd Review&quot;) a student radio station (WECX), a student activities board (Palmetto Productions) sports clubs, cultural clubs, religious clubs, political clubs, community service clubs and various academic-related clubs, such as those for anthropology, art, biology, chemistry, philosophy, law, and foreign languages.

Among the service clubs are campus chapters of Colleges Against Cancer and the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG). Eckerd College also has hosted the EC Coalition for Community Justice, a group seeking to raise campus housekeepers&#x27; wages, and is one of only a few schools in Florida to join the nationally recognized Peace Corps Prep undergraduate certificate program—helping adventurous students prepare to serve humanity after graduation.

Eckerd&#x27;s Waterfront Program is a center of watersport activities—such as sailing, kiteboarding, paddle boarding, kayaking, and fishing. An award-winning student group, Eckerd College Search and Rescue (EC-SAR), helps the U.S. Coast Guard in rescue operations throughout the Tampa Bay area.

The student-run Eckerd College Emergency Response Team, composed of professionally trained emergency medical technicians, not only prepares undergraduates for careers as first responders but is committed to aiding campus community members during medical emergencies

About 90% of Eckerd students live in on-campus residence halls. Eckerd College has 12 residence hall complexes, most with a name from the Greek alphabet. Among these, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Kappa, and Iota complexes offer traditional dorm-style housing. Omega and Nu complexes house upperclass students, and are organized around suites on each floor. Sigma and West Lodge offer an on-campus hotel style of living, with each room having its own individual bathroom. The newest dorm complex, Iota, opened on September 30, 2006.

Since 1973, Eckerd College has set aside pet-friendly housing for students wishing to bring small animals to campus. Every spring, a separate graduation ceremony is held for graduating seniors&#x27; pets, complete with certificates presented by the president. The college also built a pet park in 2014 for community use.

==Environmental sustainability==
In 2011, the Eckerd College Sustainability Program was founded.

In 2013, Sustainability Fellow (now Director) Evan Bollier &#x27;11 started &quot;Trash to Treasure,&quot; an initiative where volunteer students collect abandoned items after students move out and sell them to students returning the next year. The college has several other green initiatives including a bike sharing program, campus recycling and composting.

In 2013, the college installed a 50-kilowatt solar-powered system, the first solar initiative on campus.

In 2019, then-President Donald R. Eastman III signed a pledge to prohibit college funds from being used to buy most nonessential single-use plastics.

In 2021, Eckerd College appeared on the Princeton Review&#x27;s list of Green Colleges for its sustainability efforts, and it continues to participate in the Tree Campus USA program as it works to sustain a healthy community forest in its natural Florida setting.

In 2022, Eckerd was named one of six colleges and universities in the second cohort of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Gulf Research Program&#x27;s &quot;Gulf Scholars Program,&quot; a pilot program designed to prepare undergraduate students to address the most pressing environmental, health, energy and infrastructure challenges in the Gulf of Mexico region. It was the smallest institution so awarded: the others were the University of Central Florida, Louisiana State University, the University of South Alabama, the University of Southern Mississippi and Texas A&amp;M University at Corpus Christi.

==Athletics==

Eckerd College is a founding member of the Sunshine State Conference (NCAA Division II) fielding 14 athletic teams in coed and women&#x27;s sailing, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer, men&#x27;s baseball, women&#x27;s indoor volleyball and beach volleyball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, and women&#x27;s softball. The Eckerd varsity sailing team competes nationally as a member of the SAISA (the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Sailing Association) and is a member of the ICSA (Intercollegiate Sailing Association), having made an appearance in the Match Race Nationals in 2019.

The college&#x27;s basketball and indoor volleyball teams play in the McArthur Physical Education Center&#x27;s gymnasium. A swimming pool, adjacent to the gym, is open to all students. Eckerd&#x27;s mascot is the Triton, and the school&#x27;s colors—teal, navy and black—were adopted by the Athletics program in 2005; previously the school&#x27;s colors had been black, red, and white.

In 2006, for the first time in the 24-year history of the Eckerd College women&#x27;s volleyball program, the Tritons qualified for the NCAA South Region tournament.

In addition to Division II teams, Eckerd students participate in club sports such as men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby, lacrosse, and ultimate. The men&#x27;s club lacrosse team finished the 2006 season ranked No. 3 in the National Collegiate Club Lacrosse Poll, with a 13–1 record. Since its founding in 2003, the team captured two state championships, a regional championship, and a third-place national finish. In 2000, the Eckerd&#x27;s men&#x27;s club volleyball team won the NIRSA Division II Sports Club Volleyball Championships in Reno, Nevada. In 2019, the Eckerd Sirens Women&#x27;s Rugby team finished #3 in Division II rugby XVs and #5 in NSCRO 7s.

In 2020, the college received the Presidents’ Award from the NCAA after boasting an Academic Success Rate (ASR) of 94—marking the 10th consecutive year Eckerd has achieved an ASR of 90 or above. Also in 2020, the Eckerd Athletics Department was a finalist for the NCAA Division II Award of Excellence for its work with the 10th annual Christmas for Kids event held in December 2019. Eckerd Athletics was recognized for conducting events that promote student-athletes giving back and serving as leaders within their communities or on their campus.

<text>Ruth Eva Cleveland (October 3, 1891 – January 7, 1904), popularly known as Baby Ruth or Babe Ruth, was the eldest of five children born to United States President Grover Cleveland and First Lady Frances Cleveland. She is the purported namesake of the Baby Ruth candy bar.

==Biography==
Cleveland was born in New York City, lived at the White House and Gray Gables, the family&#x27;s summer home on Cape Cod.
After her father&#x27;s second term she moved with her family to Westland Mansion in Princeton, New Jersey, where she attended Miss Fine&#x27;s School, and died at an early age.

Ruth&#x27;s birth between Cleveland&#x27;s two terms of office caused a national sensation. At a Boston flower show over 40 chrysanthemum varieties were named in her honor. Frances dedicated herself to the child, taking on many of the roles that a woman of her status would have typically given to a nurse. The family did not permit professional photos and expected discretion from amateurs.

In the 1892 United States presidential election Ruth and Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s grandson, Benjamin Harrison McKee, known as Baby McKee, were drawn into campaign competition. One placard declared: Vote for Papa! A song written about them included the lyrics:
A sickly child, Ruth Cleveland contracted diphtheria on January 2, 1904. Doctors thought her case was mild, but she died of heart failure five days after her diagnosis. She is buried in Princeton Cemetery. Following doctor&#x27;s advice, Mrs. Cleveland did not attend the funeral; Woodrow Wilson, at the time the president of Princeton University, was present. The family never returned to Gray Gables after Ruth&#x27;s death.

==Namesake for the Baby Ruth candy bar==
The Curtiss Candy Company asserted that the &quot;Baby Ruth&quot; candy bar was named after Ruth Cleveland. Known as &quot;Kandy Kake&quot; from 1900 to 1920, it was renamed in 1921, thirty years after Ruth Cleveland&#x27;s birth and seventeen years after her death. That same year, legendary baseball player George Herman Ruth, better known by the nickname Babe Ruth, was nearing the top of his popularity, having just broken the single-season home run record.

As Richard Sandomir of &quot;The New York Times&quot; pointed out, &quot;For 85 years, Babe Ruth, the slugger, and Baby Ruth, the candy bar, have lived parallel lives in which it has been widely assumed that the latter was named for the former. The confection&#x27;s creator, the Curtiss Candy Company, never admitted to what looks like an obvious connection – especially since Ruth hit 54 home runs the year before the first Baby Ruth was devoured. Had it done so, Curtiss would have had to compensate Ruth. Instead, it eventually insisted the inspiration was &quot;Baby Ruth&quot; Cleveland, the daughter of President Grover Cleveland. But it is an odd connection that makes one wonder at the marketing savvy of Otto Schnering, the company&#x27;s founder.&quot;

Ruth sued the candy company, claiming the candy bar was using his name and not Ruth Cleveland&#x27;s, but lost the case in 1931.

<text>Marc Leclair (born August 13, 1966), better known by his stage name Akufen, is a Canadian electronic musician. His music is electronic music that is often described as minimal house, minimal techno, glitch, or microhouse.

His 2002 debut studio album &quot;My Way&quot; introduced his concept of &quot;microsampling&quot;, which was essentially a way of using extremely small and short clips of samples he had randomly recorded from FM radio broadcasts as a key musical element.

Leclair&#x27;s pseudonym comes from the French word for tinnitus (ringing of the ears), &quot;acouphène&quot;, and he has also gone under the pseudonyms Horror Inc., David Scott, Nefuka, and Anna Kaufen.

<doc id="1110286" wikidata="Q4675038" url="?curid=1110286" title="Acral lentiginous melanoma">
<text>Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a type of skin cancer. It typically begins as a uniform brownish mark before becoming darker and wider with a blurred, irregular border. ALM is most frequently seen on the foot of a person with darker skin but can also be found in non-sun exposed areas such as the palms, soles, and under finger and toenails. It may become bumpy and ulcerate. When under the nail it typically appears as dark longitudinal streaks. As it grows, ALM may also spread to other areas of the body.

Melanoma is a group of serious skin cancers that arise from pigment cells (melanocytes); acral lentiginous melanoma is a kind of lentiginous skin melanoma. ALM makes up less than 5% of all melanomas, but is considered the most common subtype in people with darker skin and is rare in people with lighter skin types. It is not caused by exposure to sunlight or UV radiation, and wearing sunscreen does not protect against it. It occurs on non-hair-bearing surfaces of the body, which have not necessarily been exposed to sunlight. It is also found on mucous membranes.

== Epidemiology ==
The absolute incidence of ALM is the same for people of all skin colors, and has not changed significantly for decades. However, because rates of other melanomas are low in non-white populations, ALM is the most common form of melanoma diagnosed amongst Asian and sub-Saharan African ethnic groups. The average age at diagnosis is between sixty and seventy years. Males and females are affected equally, but females tend to be diagnosed at earlier stages.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Typical signs of acral lentiginous melanoma include the following 

* Irregular area of pigmentation (usually dark brown or black) found on the palms, feet, or under the nail

* Longitudinal tan, black, or brown streak on a nail
* Pigmentation of proximal nail fold
Other uncommon presentations can include:

* Amelanotic or hypomelanotic areas that may be the same color or lighter than normal skin

Warning signs are new areas of pigmentation, or existing pigmentation that shows change. If caught early, ALM has a similar cure rate as the other types of superficial spreading melanoma. In contrast to cutaneous melanoma which utilizes the ABCDE rule (Asymmetry, Border, Color, Diameter, Evolving) to help identify lesions suspicious for skin cancer, an alternative pneumonic CUBED (Colored lesion, Uncertain diagnosis, Bleeding lesion, Enlargement of the lesion, Delay in healing) has been proposed for ALM based on the differences in signs and presentations between the two cancers.

ALM can also cause other non-specific symptoms if it spreads to certain areas of the body:

* Enlarged lymph nodes (lymph nodes)
* Cough or shortness of breath (lungs)
* Headache (brain)
* Weight loss (gastrointestinal system)

==Causes==
Acral lentiginous melanoma is a result of malignant melanocytes at the membrane of the skin (outer layers). The pathogenesis of ALM remains unclear, however injury or mechanical stress might play a role in its development. Unlike cutaneous melanoma, it is not caused by sunlight or UV radiation.

== Diagnosis ==

Although the ideal method of diagnosis of melanoma is complete excisional biopsy, alternative methods may be required based on the location of the melanoma. Dermatoscopy of acral pigmented lesions is very difficult but can be accomplished with diligent focus. Initial confirmation of the suspicion can be done with a small wedge biopsy or small punch biopsy. Thin deep wedge biopsies can heal very well on acral skin, and small punch biopsies may provide enough information to suggest if a lesion is cancerous. Once this confirmatory biopsy is done, a second complete excisional skin biopsy can be performed with a narrow surgical margin (1 mm). This second biopsy will determine the depth and invasiveness of the melanoma, and will help to guide further treatment if necessary. In order to establish the Breslow&#x27;s depth of the lesion, the most raised section of the pigmented area should be sampled. If the melanoma involves the nail fold or the nail bed, complete excision of the nail unit might be required for accurate sampling. 

In the event that the melanoma spreads to other sites such as the lymph nodes, another biopsy called the Sentinel lymph node biopsy may provide more information in terms of outcomes. More extensive melanomas may require wider excision (margins of 0.5 cm or more), digital amputation, lymphangiogram with lymph node dissection, or chemotherapy. 

===Histology===

The main characteristic of acral lentiginous melanoma is continuous proliferation of atypical melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction. Other histological signs of acral lentiginous melanoma include dermal invasion and desmoplasia. This invasion usually occurs many years after the initial lesion first appears.

According to Scolyer &quot;et al.&quot;, ALM &quot;is usually characterized in its earliest recognisable form as single atypical melanocytes scattered along the junctional epidermal layer&quot;.

==Treatment==
The mainstay of treatment of acral lentiginous melanoma is wide local excision. If metastatic, biologic immunotherapy agents like ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab; BRAF inhibitors, such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib; or a MEK inhibitor trametinib may be used.

When arising in the nailbed of a digit, the evidence suggests that digit-sparing surgery (wide excision and grafting) has similar outcomes to amputation, therefore, to preserve function and aesthetics it is recommended that clinicians default to digit-sparing surgery. Secondary amputation may be considered if the surgery margins are not clear of cancerous cells, or if patients develop a recurrence of the melanoma.

==Prognosis==

The prognosis of acral lentiginous melanoma is based on multiple factors including sex, age, race, Breslow depth, staging, and sentinel lymph node positivity. Out of these factors, it is believed that sentinel lymph node positivity provides the strongest prediction of cancer recurrence and death. When compared to cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM), ALM has a poorer prognosis in terms of survival rates. This poorer prognosis is thought to be related to the fact that ALM is usually diagnosed at a later stage than other skin cancers; which may be due to ALM occurring on areas of the body that are harder to notice, especially in the elderly population.

== Prevention ==
Since acral lentiginous melanoma is not linked to sun or UV exposure and the cause is not well-understood, there are no specific preventative measures. However, Patient education can be geared towards populations in which ALM is more common to increase awareness of the warning signs of ALM and other melanomas to help with earlier detection. Early detection is one of the most important factors in disease-specific survival.

== Differential Diagnoses ==

Other benign skin lesions that may mimic acral lentiginous melanoma include: Lentigo (sun spots), Acral Nevi (moles), or Onychomycosis (fungal infection of the nail). These skin lesions can appear as dark brown spots, like ALM, but can be distinguished on close examination or dermatoscopy. Other types of skin cancers like squamous cell carcinoma can also present similarly to ALM. 

==Society and culture==
Jamaican musician Bob Marley died of the condition in 1981, at the age of 36.

<doc id="1110291" wikidata="Q2655747" url="?curid=1110291" title="Criminal transmission of HIV">
<text>Criminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This is often conflated, in laws and in discussion, with criminal exposure to HIV, which does not require the transmission of the virus and often, as in the cases of spitting and biting, does not include a realistic means of transmission. Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the U.S., have enacted laws expressly to criminalize HIV transmission or exposure, charging those accused with criminal transmission of HIV. Other countries charge the accused under existing laws with such crimes as murder, manslaughter, attempted murder, assault or fraud.

Criminal transmission of HIV is now better known as HIV non-disclosure, which is the criminal offence in some jurisdictions for not disclosing an HIV positive status. This can be intentionally or unknowingly not disclosing HIV status and then exposing or transmitting HIV to a person. HIV non-disclosure includes intentional transmission, accidental transmission, unknowing transmission (where the source individual is unaware of their infection), and exposure to HIV with no transmission. Individuals have been accused of and charged for HIV non-disclosure even if no harm was intended and if HIV was not actually transmitted. Laws in some countries also criminalize mother-to-child transmission of HIV during pregnancy/birth or breastfeeding.

==Modes of transmission==
HIV is spread when one of these bodily fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, breast milk, rectal fluids, or vaginal fluids of an HIV-positive person comes into contact with a mucous membrane or bloodstream of an HIV-negative person. HIV transmission can occur via:
* Unprotected sexual intercourse
* Sharing needles or other equipment in injection drug use
* Intentionally attacking people with HIV infected needles
* Mother-to-child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding
* Receiving a blood transfusion or organ donation – although this is unlikely because blood and organ donations are extensively tested for HIV

=== Reducing chance of transmission ===
Having a low viral load decreases the chance of transmitting HIV. A person living with HIV who is taking effective antiretroviral therapy will have a viral load that becomes so low, it is undetectable (less than 50 copies of virus per milliliter). Undetectable viral loads are untransmittable. Proper use of external condoms or internal condoms also greatly reduces any chance of transmission. The correct use of PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis ) can dramatically reduce the chances of transmission for both sexual contact and intravenous drug users.

==Legal situation==
In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV &quot;can&quot; lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In court, prosecutors presented 11,000 text messages and 36 audio clips to support their case against Guerra. Since then, Guerra has been accused of intentionally exposing dozens of other men to HIV.

In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or &quot;negligent&quot; transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent.

From a global perspective, the U.S. and Canada account for the vast majority of reported prosecutions.

===Australia===
In Australia the regulations concerned with the transmission of HIV are found in two sources, the Public Healths Acts and in the criminal law.

====New South Wales====
The New South Wales (NSW) &quot;Public Health Act&quot; from 2010 regulates under section 79 that a person with HIV must disclose their status to all sexual partners. Under section 79(3) it is a defence, if the court is satisfied, that the defendant took reasonable precautions to prevent the transmission. In other Australian states, there is no specific legislative requirement to disclose.

Interventions may range from counseling through to restrictive orders, with detention as a last resort. If talking about the problems of practising safe sex does not help, the doctor may obtain a Public Health Order to manage the behaviour of the HIV positive person. Only a small number of sex workers and clients have received a Public Health Order or &#x27;management&#x27; intervention for potentially breaking the law.

Under the criminal law, a person with HIV is criminally liable for prosecution if they have intentionally transmitted the virus to their partner without informing them of their status. In NSW the relevant offences are separated into those done intentionally (s. 33 of the &quot;Crimes Act&quot; 1900), and those done recklessly (s. 35). The definition of grievous bodily harm (GBH) now explicitly includes (in ss. 4(1)(c)) &#x27;any grievous bodily disease&#x27;. This means that the infliction of grievous bodily harm refers to causing a person to contract a grievous bodily disease. Under section 33 a person who intends to inflict grievous bodily harm on another person can be imprisoned for up to 25 years while under section 35 a person who recklessly causes another person grievous bodily harm can be imprisoned for up to 10 years and 14 years if in company. This can include causing someone to be infected with HIV. A person is generally deemed as reckless when they are aware that there is a risk that another person may be caused as a result of their actions, but they proceed to act anyway.

===Canada===
Though the Canadian criminal code does not contain any HIV-specific offences, undisclosed HIV transmission and exposure have been prosecuted as aggravated assault, aggravated sexual assault and other offences.

==== Current law and policy ====
Commonly referred to as &quot;HIV non-disclosure&quot;, criminal transmission of HIV in Canada is defined as a &quot;realistic possibility of transmission&quot; of HIV during sexual intercourse. The Supreme Court of Canada defined &quot;no realistic possibility of transmission&quot; as (1) using a condom and (2) having a low or undetectable viral load. However, the threshold for a low viral load was not defined until 2017 when the Criminal Justice System&#x27;s Response to Non-Disclosure of HIV made conclusions about the current laws on HIV non-disclosure including that people with low viral loads (under 200 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood) should not be convicted under the criminal law.

In 2019, the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights released a report on the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure in Canada with four recommendations for the House of Commons and the Canadian Government. The committee recommended that a new law be created specifically for the transmission of HIV, instead of relying on pre-existing laws such as sexual assault. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and &quot;HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual&#x27;s partner is on PrEP or (4) the type of sexual act (such as oral sex) is one where there is a negligible risk of transmission.&quot; This allows for four different scenarios in which HIV positive people will not have to disclose their status because of the nature of the sexual encounter; current laws only allow for one specific scenario with multiple requirements.

HIV researchers have criticized the recommendations for not going far enough to counteract the adverse effects that the current law imposes on women. Although people living with HIV are generally aware of non-disclosure laws, many do not fully understand the law or understand when they do or do not have to disclose their status.

==== History ====
The first notable case of HIV non-disclosure is &quot;R. v Cuerrier,&quot; where the defendant was charged with aggravated assault and sexual transmission of HIV under section 268 of the Criminal Code. The Supreme Court found that the trial judge had misdirected himself and ordered a new trial on two counts of aggravated assault but in May 1999, the British Columbian Attorney-General announced that a new trial would not take place. The Court&#x27;s ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected the English authority of &quot;R. v Clarence&quot;, with L&#x27;Heureux-Dubé stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise.

&quot;R. v Mabior&quot; is the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s most recent decision outlining criminal liability for serostatus nondisclosure. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment at the time of pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004 and 2006. Despite intermittent condom use, HIV was never transmitted to his partners. Ultimately, the Court convicted Mabior with six counts of aggravated sexual assault.

Subsequent legal precedent has established that failure to disclose HIV-positive status, combined with failure to utilize protective measures (condom use), is sufficiently fraudulent behaviour to constitute turning &quot;consensual&quot; sex into aggravated sexual assault, since the other party has been denied the information necessary to give properly informed consent. The Court&#x27;s vague justification for serostatus disclosure under circumstances that lead to &quot;significant risk of bodily harm&quot; remained a particularly contentious issue in the aftermath of &quot;Cuerrier&quot;. Because &quot;Cuerrier&quot; did not expressly define &quot;significant risk&quot;, lower courts inconsistently criminalized HIV-positive defendants based on varied interpretations of the clause. In large part, &quot;Mabior&quot; represents a response to &quot;Cuerrier&quot; and an attempt to sharpen the criteria. In &quot;Mabior&quot;, the Court found that &quot;significant risk of bodily harm is negated if (i) the accused&#x27;s viral load at the time of sexual relations was low or undetectable, and (ii) condom protection was used.&quot;

On 1 December 2005, Jian Ghomeshi filed a report on this issue for the CBC. He asked whether there is a legal obligation to disclose HIV status. He held up the case of Johnson Aziga, who was diagnosed in 1996 but then allegedly had unprotected sex with at least 13 women. Aziga was charged with two counts of murder and 11 counts of aggravated sexual assault; the prosecution claims that he did not disclose his status. In 2009, Aziga was found guilty of the 2 counts of first-degree murder, 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 1 count of &quot;attempted&quot; aggravated sexual assault.

Several Canadian courts had ruled that people who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex. As a result, the death of Aziga&#x27;s partners was automatically considered to be murder instead of the lesser charge of manslaughter. However, in &quot;Mabior&quot; the Supreme Court rejected the view that consent will always be vitiated by non-disclosure of HIV-positive status, substituting the rule that there will be no consent only if in addition to the non-disclosure there was a realistic possibility of transmission of HIV.

===Finland===
The first case of criminal HIV infection in Finland was that of Steven Thomas, a US citizen from New York, who was convicted in 1997 in Helsinki for knowingly infecting Finnish women with HIV during 1993–1996. In January 1997, Finnish police published Thomas&#x27; picture in newspapers and stated that Thomas may have infected tens or even hundreds of Finnish women with HIV. Seventeen women said they had been in unprotected sexual contact with Thomas.

Thomas was given a 14-year prison sentence at the Helsinki court on 10 July 1997 for 17 counts of attempted manslaughter. Thomas was found to have infected 5 of the 17 women with HIV, and was ordered to pay damages of $63,000–$73,000 to each infected victim. The sentence was widely criticised within the legal system, because under Finnish law the maximum sentence for multiple counts of attempted manslaughter is 12 years. Lauri Lehtimaja, the Ombudsman of the Parliament, gave a warning to the court judge about his misuse of the law. The Helsinki Court of Appeal lowered the sentence in December 1997 to be 11 years and 6 months of imprisonment. The documents of the case were classified for 40 years.

In 2002 Steven Thomas was quietly released and deported from Finland to an unknown location.

A Finnish man convicted of spreading HIV knowingly through unprotected sex with many women was Aki Matti Hakkarainen. He was first convicted in 2005 and sentenced to one year and nine months in prison for attempted aggravated assault. In August 2007, Hakkarainen was arrested by Rovaniemi police after a report from a young woman saying she had contracted HIV from Hakkarainen during unprotected sex. On 5 October 2007, police published the name and photo of Hakkarainen in newspapers in an effort to reach all women who had had sexual intercourse with him.

In court, Hakkarainen admitted to having unprotected sex with the women but denied trying to infect them with the virus. On 22 April 2008, Rovaniemi court concluded that Hakkarainen knowingly infected five women with HIV, and in August 2008 he was found guilty of five counts of aggravated assault and 14 counts of attempted aggravated assault. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. He was also ordered to pay 45,000–55,000 euros compensation to the five women that contracted the virus.

===Germany===
In the Federal Republic of Germany on 16 August 2010, Nadja Benaissa of the German pop music group No Angels admitted to sex with several men while knowing her HIV-positive status, and infecting one of those several, who subsequently brought the case against her. She faced prison, but was instead given probation (two years) and community service. Women groups were outraged at the possibility of a woman being charged for negligently spreading HIV. She denied any intent to infect, apologising profusely and saying &quot;When I was arrested I realised that the way that I had dealt with the illness had been wrong... I made a big mistake... No way did I want my partner to be[come] infected.&quot; She stated that she concealed the infection to avoid hurting the success of her band. Benaissa has claimed she had been told by doctors that the risk of passing on the virus was &quot;practically zero&quot;.

===Ireland===
In 1995, Catholic priest Michael Kennedy alleged in his Sunday sermon in Dungarvan that a woman from London had deliberately infected numerous local men with HIV. While the consensus was that Kennedy was propagating an urban myth, the legal implications of such behaviour were debated. The first conviction in Ireland for reckless HIV transmission via sex was in the District Court in 2018, for a man who had unprotected sex in 2009–10 with two women without informing them of his HIV status. He had neglected to take prescribed anti-retroviral medication after a 2008 diagnosis of HIV subtype B, the same strain the two women were diagnosed with in 2010. He was sentenced to 10 years&#x27; imprisonment under s.4 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 for &quot;intentionally or recklessly caus[ing] serious harm to another&quot;. His sentence was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2023, on the basis that circumstantial evidence from the women and medical professionals should have been addressed with greater care &quot;to establish there was no reasonable possibility that either of the women could have been infected another way&quot;. Both women had initially told investigators they had no other sexual partners, but later said they had other partners but always used condoms with them.

In the 1980s and 1990s contamination of haemophilia blood products and of anti-D led to hundreds of HIV infections. Tribunals of inquiry criticised decisions by the Blood Transfusion Service Board and National Haemophilia Treatment Centre, but no criminal charges were made.

The Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 addressed an increase in syringe attack muggings and abandoned used syringes by creating offences of attacking or threatening with (s. 6), possession with intent (s. 7), and placing or abandoning (s. 8) a syringe or container of blood. It is an aggravating factor for an attacker to assert the syringe has HIV-positive blood; the victim need not perceive a risk of infection. If there is actual transmission of blood or fluid contaminated with a &quot;potentially life threatening disease&quot;, the penalty is life imprisonment.

===Libya===

The HIV trial in Libya, also called &#x27;the Bulgarian nurses affair&#x27;, concerns the trials, appeals and eventual release of six foreign medical workers charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, causing an epidemic at El-Fatih Children&#x27;s Hospital in Benghazi, Libya.

The defendants, arrested in 1999, were one Palestinian medical intern and five Bulgarian nurses (often termed &quot;medics&quot;). All of the medics were heavily tortured for months to extract confessions. The torture process is described in details in the book &quot;Notes from Hell&quot;, co-written by Nikolay Yordanov and one of the nurses, Valya Chervianashka. As a result, three of the medics signed confessions. They were first sentenced to death, had their case remanded by Libya&#x27;s highest court, and were sentenced to death again, which was upheld by Libya&#x27;s highest court in early July 2007.

A Libyan government panel later commuted their sentences to life in prison. The six were released following a deal reached with European Union representatives on humanitarian issues. The EU did not condone the guilty verdict in Libya against the six.

On 24 July 2007, the five medics and the doctor were extradited to Bulgaria, where their sentences were commuted by the Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov and they were freed. Libya has since complained about the releases, and the issue remains ongoing. Furthermore, a controversy has arisen concerning the terms of release, which allegedly include an arms trade as well as a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement signed by French President Nicolas Sarkozy in July 2007.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand&#x27;s first case for criminal HIV transmission occurred in 1993, when Peter Mwai, a Kenyan visiting New Zealand on a tourist visa, was sentenced to seven years in prison for infecting at least two women with HIV through unprotected sexual intercourse. Mwai came to New Zealand police attention after a woman reported she had contracted HIV after sleeping with him. Multiple women came forward saying they had unprotected sex with Mwai who had not told them he had HIV. At least two of the women tested positive for HIV. Peter Mwai was charged under existing laws, for causing &#x27;grievous body harm&#x27; and &#x27;reckless endangerment&#x27;.

On 6 October 2005 a New Zealand District Court ruled that HIV-positive people need not tell sexual partners about their status so long as safe sex is practiced. In the case being ruled on, the man had used a condom during intercourse but not during oral sex. His partner had not been infected. The same man was convicted of criminal nuisance earlier for having unprotected sex with another partner without revealing his HIV status.

In May 2009, a 40-year-old bisexual man from Auckland was thought to have infected at least five younger gay men between 2008 and 2009. One of the infected men had laid a formal complaint to the New Zealand police, sex venues shut their doors to what was called a &#x27;HIV predator&#x27; and police arrested the 40-year-old man on 28 May 2009. On 16 June 2009 the court heard that two more people had come forward with complaints bringing the total to six. The eight charges included that he &quot;with reckless disregard for the safety of others caused – or attempted to cause – grievous bodily harm to five males aged 17, 20, 24, 26, and 31, plus a female aged 19.&quot; He faced charges of &quot;willfully and without justification or excuse causing in a male aged 20 and a female aged 19 a disease, namely HIV.&quot; The trial set for 2010 did not proceed as Glenn Mills, accused of knowingly exposing fourteen young people to HIV, was found dead in his Mt Eden remand prison cell on 30 November 2009 after having made two unsuccessful applications to be released on bail in prior weeks.

===Netherlands===
Three HIV-positive men, Peter Mulder, Hans Jurgens and Wim Dekker, were jailed in 2008 on charges of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm after drugging and raping 14 men, some of whom they injected with their own HIV-infected blood. Twelve of the victims were HIV-positive or suffering from AIDS at the time of the trial.

===Poland===
In Poland under Art. 161 of the Criminal Code, persons who knowingly risk infecting others with HIV are liable to be jailed up to 3 years.

===Russia===
Infecting another individual with HIV is a criminal offense unless that individual knew about HIV infection beforehand and consented.

===United Kingdom===

Transmission generally may fall under sections 18, 20, 23, 24 or 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 (respectively grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent or to resist arrest, GBH generally, poisoning (two sections), and actual bodily harm).

As of 19 June 2006, there had been seven convictions for the sexual transmission of HIV in England and Wales under s.20 of the 1861 Act which, &quot;inter alia&quot;, criminalizes the reckless inflicting of grievous bodily harm. Of these, five were men accused of infecting female partners during sex, one was a man who pleaded guilty to infecting a male partner, and one (in Wales) was a woman. In 2005, the 20-year-old Welsh woman was convicted of infecting her boyfriend with HIV during sex, knowing she had the infection. In 2006, a 43-year-old woman pleaded guilty to recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm on her 31-year-old lover.

Only two cases pleaded &#x27;not guilty&#x27;, and both have gone to appeal. In &quot;R. v Dica&quot; the Court of Appeal held that a person was reckless if, knowing that they were HIV-positive, they transmitted HIV to a person who had not been told of the infection, and convicted him of a total sentence of 8 years&#x27; imprisonment. It was not necessary to prove that the transmission had involved an assault for the &quot;inflicting&quot; of the disease. They acknowledged that there could be a higher standard of disclosure expected of someone in a relationship, compared with the &quot;known risks&quot; involved in casual sex. Matthew Weait has critically discussed the case.

In &quot;R. v Konzani&quot; the same court held that a person accused of recklessly transmitting HIV could only raise the defense of consent, in cases where that consent was a &quot;willing&quot; or &quot;conscious&quot; consent. In other words, the court distinguished between &quot;willingly running the risk of transmission&quot; and &quot;willingly consenting to the risk of transmission&quot;. This suggests that consent will only operate as a defense—in all but the most exceptional of cases—where there has already been prior disclosure of known HIV-positive status.

, two women have been convicted for passing on an HIV infection in the UK. The first, from Cardiff, was jailed for 2 years; the second, Sarah Jane Porter, was convicted of grievous bodily harm through the reckless transmission of HIV, and was sentenced to 32 months in prison in June 2006.

The National AIDS Trust has published a table of cases of people in England and Wales charged with reckless sexual transmission of HIV.

In November 2017, a man called Daryll Rowe was convicted of grievous bodily harm after intentionally infecting five men with the virus and attempting to infect five more. The Rowe case has been reported as being the first case in the United Kingdom where the defendant was found guilty for intentionally rather than recklessly transmitting the virus. In 2017, another man, Antonio Reyes-Minana, was convicted of grievous bodily harm after withholding his HIV status from two male partners.

An important issue that arises where proof of transmission is required is establishing the source of the complainant&#x27;s HIV infection. Although it cannot prove the route and timing of transmission, phylogenetic analysis has been used in many trials to demonstrate how closely related HIV strains in samples taken from the defendant and complainant are. The issues and problems surrounding phylogenetic analysis in criminal investigation are discussed in a 2007 report by aidsmap.

Presentations from the Economic and Social Research Council funded 2011 seminar series &quot;HIV/AIDS and Law: Theory, Practice and Policy&quot; at Keele University deal with the question of criminalization.

====Scotland====
In February 2001 Stephen Kelly, an ex-prisoner and former IV drug user, was convicted of the Scots common law offence of &quot;recklessly injuring&quot; his former partner by infecting her with HIV. In &quot;HMA v Deveraux&quot; (2010), the HIV positive defendant pleaded guilty to reckless injury on four counts, one of which led to the victim contracting HIV.

===United States===

Criminal statutes against transmission of HIV exist primarily at the state level. These were significantly influenced by the passage of the Ryan White CARE Act which predicated federal funding for state AIDS treatment programs on states having said statutes in place.

In July 2010 the White House announced a major change in its HIV/AIDS policy, a change informed by public health law research carried out by Scott Burris, professor of law at Temple University and the director of its Public Health Law Research program. The Obama administration&#x27;s National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States concluded that &quot;the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws [that criminalize HIV infection] run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment.&quot;

In the fall of 2010, the Center for HIV Law and Policy launched the &#x27;Positive Justice Project&#x27;, a campaign to combat HIV-related stigma and discrimination against people with HIV by the U.S. criminal justice system. It released a manual of HIV-specific laws and prosecutions in the 50 states, District of Columbia, U.S. territories, federal government, and military in 2010.

On 23 September 2011, Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) introduced H.R. 3053, The &quot;Repeal Existing Policies that Encourage and Allow Legal HIV Discrimination Act&quot; or the &quot;REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act&quot;. The &quot;REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act&quot; calls for review of all federal and state laws, policies, and regulations regarding the criminal prosecution of individuals for HIV-related offenses. The bill died in the Subcommittee on Health, and also in 2013/2014 when introduced as H.R. 1843 and referred to the Subcommittee on Military Personnel.

Courts have looked into the statistical probability of HIV transmission to overturn or reduce criminal sentences resulting from prosecutions. For example, on 23 February 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces reversed the aggravated assault conviction of Technical Sergeant David Gutierrez upon determining, that the risk of HIV transmission through sexual intercourse was not &quot;likely to produce death or grievous bodily harm&quot; under the applicable statute.

As of 2017, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that those who have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood cannot transmit the virus, but only when they are compliant with treatment.

==Criticism of criminal statutes==
Research has been done on the effects of the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure. It has been demonstrated that these types of laws increase HIV stigma and negatively affect public health. HIV non-disclosure laws and criminalization of HIV transmission may make people less likely to access HIV testing and less likely to disclosure their status or discuss sexual health with a healthcare provider. Although women only make up 10% of Canadian non-disclosure prosecutions, there is an overrepresentation of prosecuted sex workers, Indigenous women, and abuse survivors. There is also a higher proportion of women and indigenous people involved in cases based on low levels of blameworthiness (i.e. difficult life circumstance, spontaneous sexual acts, compliance with authorities, condom use, and evidence that the accused was abused by the complainant).

South Africa&#x27;s openly HIV-positive Supreme Court Justice Edwin Cameron argued against criminalisation at the XVII International AIDS Conference in Mexico City.

<text>Noop (, like &quot;no-op&quot;) was a project by Google engineers Alex Eagle and Christian Gruber aiming to develop a new programming language. Noop attempted to blend the best features of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;new&quot; languages, while syntactically encouraging well accepted programming best-practices. Noop was initially targeted to run on the Java Virtual Machine.

Noop progressed past its initial proposals into a limited interpreter, but according to the project owners they no longer intend to pursue the language any further. Among the reasons cited for discontinuing work on the language was the initial release of Kotlin, which achieves many of the language goals of Noop. The Noop language can be executed as an interpreted language, as a compiled language, or as Java code.

== Creation ==
The Noop language was created by Google. It was presented during the 2009 edition of the JVM Language Summit held in Santa Clara, California from September 16 to 18, 2009.

== Examples ==
Hello world in Noop

import noop.Application;
import noop.Console;

class HelloWorld(Console console) implements Application {

 Int main(List args) {
 String s = &quot;Hello World!&quot;;

 console.println(s);
 return 0;
}

<text>James Erwin Downey (born August 10, 1942) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1999, and served as a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative governments of Sterling Lyon and Gary Filmon.

==Early life==
Downey was born in Melita, Manitoba. He served as an Air Cadet, and received an Agriculture Diploma from the University of Manitoba. Before entering political life, he worked as a farmer and auctioneer.

==Manitoba politics==
Downey was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977, scoring a fairly easy victory in the southwestern rural riding of Arthur (generally regarded as a safe seat for the party). Lyon&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives defeated the New Democratic Party under Edward Schreyer in this election, and Downey was appointed as Minister of Agriculture on October 24, 1977. He held this position until November 30, 1981, when the NDP returned to power. Downey himself was easily re-elected in the 1981 election, defeating his NDP opponent by over 3500 votes.

Despite a credible challenge from the new Confederation of Regions Party, Downey was again re-elected without too much difficulty in the 1986 provincial election. Two years later, he faced a stronger challenge from Liberal Douglas Mosset, but still retained his seat by over 2000 votes.

The Progressive Conservatives under Gary Filmon formed a minority government after this election, and Downey returned to cabinet on May 9, 1988 as Minister of Northern Affairs with responsibility for Native Affairs, the Manitoba Natural Resources Development Act, A.E. McKenzie Co. Ltd., the Manitoba Oil and Gas Corporation Act and the Communities Economic Development Fund Act. On April 21, 1989 he was also named minister responsible for Seniors.

Downey was again re-elected in the general election of 1990, defeating Liberal Glen McKinnon (later a federal MP) by 2688 votes. He was named Deputy Premier on September 27, 1990, and on February 5, 1991 was named as Minister of Rural Development. After a cabinet shuffle on January 14, 1992, Downey was named Minister of Northern and Native Affairs and Minister of Energy and Mines. He was transferred again on September 10, 1993, this time to the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism with responsibility for the Communities Development Corporation Act.

Downey was again re-elected without difficulty in the 1995 provincial election, and continued to serve as Deputy Premier and Industry Minister until February 5, 1999. He did not seek re-election later in the year, but instead served as campaign manager for the Progressive Conservatives in their loss to Gary Doer&#x27;s New Democrats. (He had played the same role for the party in their successful campaign of 1995.)

In 2000, Downey endorsed Tom Long&#x27;s bid to lead the newly formed Canadian Alliance party (&quot;National Post&quot;, 10 May 2000). In 2004, he endorsed Belinda Stronach for leader of the new Conservative Party of Canada.

Downey ran for a directorship on the Canadian Wheat Board in 2002, campaigning against the board&#x27;s monopoly status. He lost to incumbent Bill Nicholson, who supports the current system.

<text>Enfleurage is a process that uses odorless fats that are solid at room temperature to capture the fragrant compounds, such as volatile oils, produced by plants. The process can be &quot;cold&quot; enfleurage or &quot;hot&quot; enfleurage.

== Process ==
There are two types of enfleurage:
*In cold enfleurage, a large framed glass plate, called a chassis, is smeared with a layer of animal fat, usually lard (from pork) or tallow (from beef), and allowed to set. Botanical matter, usually petals or whole flowers, is then placed on the fat and its scent is allowed to diffuse into the fat over the course of 1–3 days. The process is then repeated by replacing the spent botanicals with fresh ones until the fat has reached a desired degree of fragrance saturation. This procedure was developed in southern France in the 18th century for the production of high-grade concentrates.
*In hot enfleurage, solid fats are heated and botanical matter is stirred into the fat. Spent botanicals are repeatedly strained from the fat and replaced with fresh material until the fat is saturated with fragrance. This method is considered the oldest known procedure for preserving plant fragrance substances.

In both instances, once the fat is saturated with fragrance, it is then called the &quot;enfleurage pomade&quot;. The enfleurage pomade was either sold as it was, or it could be further washed or soaked in ethyl alcohol to draw the fragrant molecules into the alcohol. The alcohol was then separated from the fat and allowed to evaporate, leaving behind the absolute of the botanical matter. The spent fat is usually used to make soaps since it is still relatively fragrant.

== Other fragrance extraction methods ==

The enfleurage fragrance extraction method is one of the oldest. It is also highly inefficient and costly but was the sole method of extracting the fragrant compounds in delicate flowers such as jasmine and tuberose, which would be destroyed or denatured by the high temperatures required by methods of fragrance extraction such as steam distillation. The method is now superseded by more efficient techniques such as solvent extraction or supercritical fluid extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) or similar compressed gases.

<text>In cell biology, U-87 MG is a human glioblastoma cell line that is commonly used in brain cancer research.

==History and Characteristics==
Formally known as U-87 MG (abbreviation for Uppsala 87 Malignant Glioma), the U87 cell line has an epithelial morphology and was obtained from a 44-year-old female patient in 1966 at Uppsala University. The cell line was thought to be deposited at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in 1973, after which the ATCC obtained it in 1982. However, in 2016 the commonly used version of U87MG (from the ATCC) was found to be non-identical to its patient of origin. Analysis of DNA profile and mtDNA position suggest that the Uppsala U-87 MG line is authentic to the original tumor tissue while the ATCC U-87 MG line is not; The ATCC line is likely a bona fide human glioblastoma cell line of unknown origin. The entire sequence of the genome of U-87 MG has been published in PLoS Genetics.
U-87 MG can be obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) where it is known by the accession number HTB-14 and it is reported that the cell line comes from a male patient of unknown age. 

==Growth conditions==
U87 growth media is generally made with Eagle&#x27;s minimum essential medium + 10% FBS + 100 U/mL penicillin + 100 μg/mL streptomycin. It is propagated at 37 °C in a 5% carbon dioxide atmosphere.

<text>Major General Nguyễn Khoa Nam (23 September 1927 – 30 April 1975) was a native of Đà Nẵng and served in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). He received his primary education at the École des Garçons in Đà Nẵng and graduated in 1939. After joining the French-sponsored Vietnam National Army (VNA), he attended the Thủ Đức Military Academy and graduated in 1953.

==Military service==
As a sub-lieutenant, his (chuan uy&#x27;s) first assignment was to an airborne unit. He served in various positions within the VNA during the First Indochina War (1953–1955) and joined the ARVN in 1955. He served as a lieutenant in the airborne, a company commander in the 7th Airborne Battalion, a major in command of 5th Airborne Battalion, as lieutenant colonel (and later colonel) of the 3rd Airborne Brigade.

In January 1970 he was appointed as commander of the 7th Division where he was credited with making remarkable progress and later promoted to Brigadier general. He then served as a major general commanding IV Corps Tactical Zone.

His numerous decorations include the National Order of Vietnam Fourth Class medal and National Order of Vietnam Third Class medal. As a Major general, he liked to carried out operations across Mekong Delta to prevent VC taking over any regional districts.

On 30 April 1975, with the Fall of Saigon, rather than fleeing the country or surrendering, he and his deputy commander, General Lê Văn Hưng shot themselves dead. He was buried at Cần Thơ Military Cemetery the following day.

<doc id="1110338" wikidata="Q626822" url="?curid=1110338" title="Phantasy Star IV">
<text>is a 1993 role-playing video game by Sega for the Sega Genesis. It was first released in Japan and later in Europe and North America in 1995. It is the fourth and final game in the original &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series, concluding the story of the Algol Star System. &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; kept many of the gameplay elements of the previous game, including turn-based battles, overhead exploration, and magic spells. It received mixed reviews upon its release but has since been considered one of the greatest video games of all time.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; is an archetypal role-playing video game, featuring the staples of exploration, NPC interaction, and turn-based combat. Like the previous games in the &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; series, individual characters each have their own statistics and equipment that determine the character&#x27;s performance in combat, improving their statistics by gaining experience levels (achieved through victory in combat). Additionally, non-android characters have access to &quot;Techniques&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; magic spells), the use of which draw upon a character&#x27;s pool of &quot;Technique Points&quot; (TP), with new techniques being learned as a character gains levels.

&quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; has a number of features new to the series, including combination techniques, manga-style panel illustrations that accompany the narrative, and an expanded script.

The instruction manual for the American version states that there are 15 possible combination-attacks. However, only 14 were ever discovered. Occasionally, the &quot;secret technique&quot; Feeve, a useless technique accessible through hacking, is mistaken for the &quot;lost 15th combo&quot;.

==Plot==
&quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; takes place 1,000 years after the events of &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; and 1,000 years before the era of &quot;Phantasy Star III&quot;. After an event called the Great Collapse, much of the once-thriving planet Motavia has reverted to its original desert-state as the climate and biosphere-controlling devices installed over a thousand years previously begin to fail, and life has become progressively more difficult for the planet&#x27;s inhabitants. To make matters worse, there has been a marked increase in the numbers of the &quot;biomonsters&quot;, a catch-all term for the strange and violent aberrations of Motavia&#x27;s flora and fauna. Keeping these creatures under control is the job of &quot;hunters.&quot;

Hired by Piata Academy on Motavia, hunters Alys Brangwin and her young apprentice Chaz Ashley begin their investigation into the relationship between the biomonster problem and the planet&#x27;s ecological crisis. Joined by others along the way, they connect the world&#x27;s troubles to a cult leader called Zio, &quot;The Black Magician&quot;, whose aims appear to be total annihilation of not only Motavia but of the whole Algol solar system. During their initial confrontation, Zio summons Dark Force — the same antagonist of previous games — and mortally wounds Alys with its Dark Energy Wave. Taking the lead upon her passing, Chaz is joined by Alys’s wizard acquaintance Rune Walsh who helps break the barrier on Zio’s tower and eliminate the wizard to restore the computer systems maintaining Motavia. With no change in Algo’s abnormal conditions, the party turns their attention to a malfunctioning satellite space station found to be contaminated by Dark Force, which they are forced to engage and purge. However, Algo’s disasters remain unabated and the party is further baffled as they encounter multiple incarnations of Dark Force along the way.

Traveling to Rykros, an unknown fourth planet of the Algo solar system, Chaz and his companions learn of the Profound Darkness: a powerful entity banished behind a planetary seal billions of years ago that is able to manifest its hatred in physical form as Dark Force every thousand years due to fluctuations in the seal. With the seal now severely weakened by the planet Parma’s destruction during the Great Collapse, Chaz and his party enter the Profound Darkness’s dimension and eliminate it before it is able to break completely free and destroy the galaxy. With the evil banished for good and the party going their separate ways, Rika — a numan girl in the group — chooses to stay behind with Chaz as they bid everyone farewell, remembering the sacrifice of those who have defended Algo through the ages and awaiting the next one to come.

==Release==
The game was released in Japan in December 1993, North America in February 1995 and the United Kingdom and Europe in December, 1995. End of the Millennium was the first &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; title not to be localized to Brazil by Tec Toy. Sega initially stated that they would not publish the game in Europe.

In the United States, the game retailed for just under $100.

The cover art for the American and European releases was done by Boris Vallejo. Both covers depict Chaz, Rika, and Rune, but the American/European box art deviates from their appearance in-game.

In Japan, the game was initially announced as &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot;, but by the time of release, it had been renamed &quot;Phantasy Star: The End of the Millennium&quot;. At the time, this renaming was seen by the gaming press as an attempt to make it clear that the game was a followup to &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;. The American and European releases took the title &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot;, though the title screen of all versions of the game reads &quot;Phantasy Star: The End of the Millennium&quot;. The titles are combined to &quot;Phantasy Star IV: The End of the Millennium&quot; in the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; compilation.

&quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; was the last &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; game until &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; (2000), which has a mainly unrelated story.

===Ports and remakes===
An unlicensed demake of the game for the 8 bits NES famiclones was published in Chinese by Fuzhou Waixing Computer Science &amp; Technology Co. Ltd. in 1996.

The game was ported as part of &quot;Phantasy Star Collection&quot; for the Sega Saturn, released only in Japan. There was a Windows port released in 2004, as well as its inclusion in the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot;, &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot;, &quot;Sega Genesis Classics&quot;, and the Sega Genesis Mini. &quot;Sega Ages&quot; planned a remake for the PlayStation 2 console, having revamped the first two games: &quot;Phantasy Star Generation 1&quot; and &quot;Phantasy Star Generation 2&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Phantasy Star IV: End of the Millennium&quot; received generally positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the gameplay but with mixed reactions to the story and graphics. &quot;GamePro&quot; praised the ability to inspect background objects, the convenience of the macros and talk option, the translation, and the story sequences. However, they commented that the inability to purchase multiple items at once is irritating, and described the story as frequently incoherent and occasionally derogatory towards women. &quot;Next Generation&quot; remarked that &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot;, &quot;while still a good game, is years behind.&quot; They elaborated that while other RPGs were making major innovations to the genre in both graphics and gameplay, &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; still fundamentally looked and played the same as &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; from five years before. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; commented that the magic/technique system, equipment and general gameplay are all highly involving and enjoyable, but that the graphics are mediocre, the music is irritating, and the story is too slow-paced. &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; (previously &quot;Sega Magazine&quot;) said that the graphics are outdated even compared to other Mega Drive/Genesis games and that the game is incomprehensible to newcomers to the series, but that &quot;the game succeeds by creating cinematic moments, introducing new characters and powers, and taking many weird and wonderful plot turns.&quot; &quot;Mean Machines&quot; criticized the graphics, animation, and effects, but praised the playability, story, and lastability, calling it the &quot;best pure RPG for the Megadrive.&quot; The three reviewers of &quot;GameFan&quot; rated it 90, 97, and 92, stating the &quot;graphics are beautiful, the music is powerful, and the non-stop original ideas make this cartridge an absolute must-own for the RPG enthusiast&quot; while criticizing the translation.

Retrospective reviews have been very positive, with praise for the gameplay, story and visuals. In &quot;RPGamer&quot;, Sephirstein praised the title as one of the greatest RPGs he had ever played, with &quot;magnificent graphics, sensational soundtrack, gripping story and incredible battle system&quot;. Parn of &quot;RPGFan&quot; also called it one of &quot;the best RPGs ever made&quot;. Reviews for the Virtual Console release were also very positive. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot;″s Corbie Dillard said that one could not have asked for a better end to the 16-bit series. &quot;IGN&quot; called it one of the definitive 16-bit role-playing games, stating the &quot;storyline and characters are deep and engaging&quot;, the &quot;attractive anime-style cutscenes steal the show visually&quot;, and the gameplay is both &quot;classic and unique at the same time&quot;. &quot;Tor.com&quot; described it as &quot;an ambitious JRPG that is the perfect end to the series, taking the best elements of each of the previous games and weaving together a &#x27;phantastic&#x27; journey.&quot; &quot;Eurogamer&quot; stated that it is &quot;epic in scope&quot; and recommended that &quot;anyone with a fondness for JRPGs should investigate this at once&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; as the 61st best game ever made. In 2012, &quot;IGN&quot; placed &quot;Phantasy Star IV&quot; at number 59 in their Top 100 RPGs of all time, citing the elegantly simple mechanics and the game&#x27;s influence on &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; (which they ranked as number 23 on the list). In 2009, &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; labelled the title, along with &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot;, as one of the greatest RPGs of all time. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked the game number 2, behind only &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot;, in its list of the best Sega Genesis games.
