<text>Sir John Frederick Neville Cardus, CBE (2 April 188828 February 1975) was an English writer and critic. From an impoverished home background, and mainly self-educated, he became &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;″s cricket correspondent in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions to these two distinct fields in the years before the Second World War established his reputation as one of the foremost critics of his generation.

Cardus&#x27;s approach to cricket writing was innovative, turning what had previously been largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, in contrast to the objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus&#x27;s opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.

Cardus spent the Second World War years in Australia, where he wrote for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and gave regular radio talks. He also wrote books on music, and completed his autobiography. After his return to England he resumed his connection with &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; as its London music critic. He continued to write on cricket, and produced books on both his specialisms. Cardus&#x27;s work was publicly recognised by his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964 and the award of a knighthood in 1967, while the music and cricket worlds acknowledged him with numerous honours. In his last years, he became a guru and inspirational figure to aspiring young writers.

==Early life==

===Family background and early childhood===
Neville Cardus was born on 2 April 1888 in Rusholme, Manchester. Throughout his childhood and young adulthood he was known as &quot;Fred&quot;. There has been confusion over his birth date. The birthdate of 2 April 1888 is as given on his baptism record; and it is 2 April when he celebrated his birthday, albeit believing that he was born in 1889: Cardus himself hosted a dinner party on 2 April 1959 believing this to be his 70th birthday. His birth certificate shows a birthdate of 3 April 1888, but this has been argued to be incorrect, since the date of registration of 15 May 1888 was such that using the birth date of 2 April would have breached the requirement to register a birth in no more than 42 days. Some sources give the birthdate as 2 April 1889, Neville&#x27;s mother was Ada Cardus, one of six daughters of Robert and Ann Cardus of 4 Summer Place, Rusholme. On 14 July 1888, when the baby was three months old, Ada married Neville&#x27;s father, John Frederick Newsham, a blacksmith. Cardus&#x27;s autobiographical works refer to his father as a violinist in an orchestra, but there is no other evidence for this. Four days after the wedding, Cardus&#x27;s father left by boat for America, with the intention that Ada follow. However, Ada changed her mind and went to live with Eliahoo Joseph, a Turkish merchant and possibly a pimp, with Ada a prostitute. John Frederick Newsham returned to England and divorced Ada in 1899. It was said that within a few years Ada and Neville had returned to her parents&#x27; home in Summer Place.

Robert Cardus was a retired policeman; Neville referred to him as receiving a small pension, although a search of police archives found no trace of this. The family took in neighbours&#x27; washing, and the household income was further supplemented by his daughters&#x27; earnings from part-time prostitution. In his autobiographical writings, Cardus refers to his home environment at Summer Place as &quot;sordid ... unlettered and unbeautiful&quot;, yet enlivened by laughter: &quot;Humour kept breezing in&quot;. Commentators have suggested that Cardus tended to overstate the deprived aspects of his childhood; his biographer Christopher Brookes asserts that &quot;Cardus was the product neither of a slum, nor a cultural desert&quot;. Robert Cardus, though uneducated, was not illiterate, and was instrumental in awakening his grandson&#x27;s literary interests. Theatres, libraries and other cultural facilities were easily accessible from the Cardus home.

Neville described his formal schooling as limited to five years at the local board school, where the curriculum was basic and the methods of tuition harsh: &quot;[T]he boy who showed the faintest sign of freedom of the will was caned&quot;. There is, however, doubt as to whether his schooling lasted only five years and whether he attended a board school or a Church of England school. The experience did not curb Neville&#x27;s intellectual curiosity; at a very young age he was expanding his cultural horizons, through the worlds of reading and of music hall and pantomime. When he was 10 years old he discovered the novels of Dickens; years later he wrote that there were two classes of person, &quot;those who have it in them from birth onwards to appreciate Dickens and those who haven&#x27;t. The second group should be avoided as soon as detected&quot;. His earliest creative writing took the form of a handwritten magazine, &quot;The Boy&#x27;s World&quot;, full of articles and stories he had written. He circulated it among his schoolmates, until it was discovered and torn up by an irate teacher.

===Manchester, 1901–12===

After Robert Cardus&#x27;s death in 1900 the family moved several times, eventually breaking up altogether. Cardus left school in 1901 and took a variety of short-term, unskilled jobs before finding more secure employment as a clerk with Flemings&#x27; marine insurance agency. He lived for a time with his Aunt Beatrice with whom, according to Brookes, he had at an early age &quot;embarked on a lifelong love affair ... In his eyes she could do no wrong&quot;. A flamboyant character, Beatrice brought colour into Cardus&#x27;s life; she encouraged him to read worthwhile books and her memory, Brookes asserts, &quot;remained a potent inspirational force&quot; throughout his later life as a writer. She also bought him his first cricket bat.

These years were a period of intense self-education. Cardus became an habitué of the local libraries, and extended his reading from Dickens to include many of the masters of literature: Fielding, Thackeray, Conrad and—with more reservation—Hardy and Henry James. In due course he added philosophy and metaphysics to his curriculum; this began with his discovery of George Henry Lewes, which led him on to the works of Kant, Hume, Berkeley and, eventually, Schopenhauer. He supplemented these studies by attending free lectures at Manchester University, and met regularly with a group of like-minded autodidacts at Alexandra Park or, in the winter, at the Lyons café in Albert Square, to discuss and debate for whole afternoons. At first Cardus&#x27;s schedule of self-improvement was random; eventually he compiled what he called a &quot;cultural scheme&quot; whereby he devoted a set weekly number of hours to different subjects.
Cardus&#x27;s interest in music began with the popular tunes sung by his mother and her sisters in the family home. He remembered hearing for the first time the melody of the &quot;Vilja&quot; song from Franz Lehár&#x27;s operetta &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, which &quot;curled its way into my heart to stay there for a lifetime&quot;. In April 1907 he was &quot;swept ... into the seven seas of music&quot; by a performance of Edward German&#x27;s operetta &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. &quot;I am unable to explain&quot;, Cardus wrote many years later, &quot;why it should have been left to Edward German—of all composers—to release the flood&quot;. He began going to the Hallé Orchestra&#x27;s concerts at the Free Trade Hall where, on 3 December 1908, he was present at the premiere of Elgar&#x27;s first symphony, under Hans Richter. He regularly attended the fortnightly concerts at the Royal Manchester College of Music, where students&#x27; performances were assessed by the principal, Adolph Brodsky. As part of his scheme of study, Cardus briefly took singing lessons, his only formal instruction in music. In 1916 Cardus published his first musical article, &quot;Bantock and Style in Music&quot;, in &quot;Musical Opinion&quot;.

Alongside his intellectual pursuits Cardus played and followed cricket. As a small boy he had begun to visit Old Trafford Cricket Ground to watch Lancashire matches: &quot;The first cricketer I saw was A.C. MacLaren ... I can still see the swing of MacLaren&#x27;s bat, the great follow-through finishing high and held there with the body poised&quot;. In 1902 he saw the Test match against Australia in which Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch and thereby won a permanent place among Cardus&#x27;s heroes. Cardus first played cricket on rough waste land close to his home in Rusholme; as he matured he developed as an effective medium-paced off break bowler, and for several seasons from 1908 onwards he played as a weekend professional in Manchester league cricket. &quot;I am not ashamed to confess that I seldom hesitated, as soon as a batsman came to the crease, to let him have a quick one bang in the penis; after which a quick, simple straight one would invariably remove him from the scene&quot;.

==Shrewsbury==
In the spring of 1912, in search of a change from his unrewarding clerical job, Cardus applied for the post of assistant cricket coach at Shrewsbury School, citing his bowling averages in Manchester club cricket. He reasoned that, by living frugally during the Shrewsbury summers, he would be able to finance his winter studies of music and literature. His application was successful, and in May 1912 he began his duties. He worked initially under Walter Attewell, a former Nottinghamshire professional, and later under the Yorkshire and England cricketer Ted Wainwright. Cardus established good working relations with both of these, but identified most closely with Cyril Alington, the school&#x27;s headmaster: &quot;Because of Alington I call myself ... an old Salopian&quot;. Alington first detected Cardus&#x27;s intellectual potential when he found him reading a copy of Gilbert Murray&#x27;s translation of Euripides&#x27;s drama &quot;Medea&quot;. In August 1914, in addition to his cricketing duties he became Alington&#x27;s secretary, after the previous incumbent joined the army at the outbreak of war; Cardus was rejected for military service because of his poor eyesight.
Cardus did not find his duties at Shrewsbury onerous. He made frequent trips to Manchester, for Hallé concerts or to watch Thomas Beecham conduct at the Manchester Opera House. He found time for other work; thus, in the winter of 1913–14, he was the music critic for the northern edition of &quot;The Daily Citizen&quot;. This short-lived newspaper was an official organ of the early Labour Party; mainly out of admiration for Bernard Shaw Cardus had joined the Independent Labour Party, but quickly lost interest in socialism: &quot;Their creed or system was obviously not to be a means to an end but an end in itself&quot;. According to Brookes, the influence of Shrewsbury School affected Cardus to the extent that &quot;[t]he playing fields of an English public school were for him a more natural setting than the iconoclastic frenzy of the Lyons café where socialism vied with Richard Strauss for pride of place in the race to modernity&quot;. &quot;The Daily Citizen&quot; paid poorly, and Cardus&#x27;s association with it ended in April 1914.

Cardus spent his winters in Manchester, studying hard in anticipation of any opportunity for an opening as a music critic, eking out his summer savings by taking temporary clerical work. Around 1916 he met Edith King, an art teacher and amateur actress who became a regular attender at the Lyons café meetings. In the summers, when Cardus returned to Shrewsbury, she kept him informed of musical and cultural events in Manchester. The Shrewsbury years, which Brookes describes as a &quot;magical interlude&quot;, ended suddenly when, at the end of the 1916 summer, Alington was appointed headmaster of Eton. Initially it seemed likely that Cardus would join him there as his secretary, but Cardus&#x27;s military exemption was under review; the uncertainty of his position ended the possibility of a post at Eton. He left Shrewsbury in September 1916 with little money, and no immediate prospects of regular work.

==&quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, 1917–1940==

===First years===

In the winter of 1916–17 Cardus continued his private studies while working intermittently; among various jobs, he collected insurance premiums for a burial society. Early in January 1917 he wrote to C. P. Scott, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;″s editor, asking for any available post at the paper, as &quot;the means whereby to continue my education&quot;. To bolster his chances he enclosed specimens of his writing. The result was, first, a temporary unpaid position as Scott&#x27;s secretary, but in mid-March Scott offered a job on the paper&#x27;s reporting staff. The writer J. B. Priestley later asserted that Cardus, who did not know shorthand, was engaged not as a reporter, but as a &quot;writer&quot;. In Cardus&#x27;s own account of these years he appears to have been fully engaged in reporters&#x27; duties, his lack of shorthand being dismissed by the chief reporter, Haslam Mills, who paraphrased Shakespeare: &quot;Some men are born to shorthand, others achieve shorthand, while others have shorthand thrust upon them&quot;. Mills advised Cardus to concentrate on style: &quot;We can be decorative at times; we can even be amusing. Here, possibly, you will find scope&quot;.

Within a year Cardus had been moved from the reporters&#x27; room to take charge of the paper&#x27;s &quot;Miscellany&quot; column. He also resumed the duties of part-time secretary to Scott, who was at this time over 70, and had edited &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; since 1872. Despite his years, he struck Cardus as &quot;of inexhaustible energy and aliveness&quot;. Scott was a demanding employer, who gave his young writers free rein, but expected in return long hours and total dedication. Driven hard, sometimes to the point of exhaustion, Cardus nevertheless relished these years, and never complained to Scott of weariness. Early in 1919 his role changed again, when he was made junior drama critic under the direction of C.E. Montague, the paper&#x27;s principal theatre critic who had returned from war service with no great desire to continue in the role. Cardus&#x27;s principal ambitions still lay in the direction of music criticism, though he recognised that this door was closed while Samuel Langford, music critic since 1906, remained in post. In preparation for any opportunity that might arise in that direction, Cardus maintained a daily two-hour study of music or music literature.

===Cricket correspondent===

In the spring of 1919, while recovering from a serious pulmonary condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, William Percival Crozier, that he should watch some cricket at Old Trafford and, if he felt able, write reports on a few matches. He had earlier written four articles on cricket for the newspaper. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to the first day of Lancashire&#x27;s match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: &quot;I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair ... and I fitted myself into the idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919&quot;. Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper&#x27;s regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line &quot;Cricketer&quot;, a position he held for 20 years.

Cardus&#x27;s emergence as cricket correspondent was concurrent with another appointment, that of deputy and successor designate to Langford as music critic. In January 1920 Cardus reported on two recitals by the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing, and apparently impressed Scott with the quality of his notice, although the accuracy of Cardus&#x27;s summary of events has been questioned. With the succession to Langford assured, and a significant increase in salary, Cardus was happy to devote his summers exclusively to cricket. He remained circumspect about his commitment to the sport: &quot;Never have I regarded my cricket as more than a means to an end; that end being always music&quot;. Nevertheless, he developed a style of cricket reporting that quickly lifted him to the forefront of contemporary sports writers. He did this, according to his fellow cricket writer Gerald Howat, by using imagery and metaphor to create &quot;a mythology of characters and scenes&quot;. John Arlott described Cardus as &quot;the creat[or] of modern cricket writing&quot;.

The new sense of financial and professional security was probably instrumental in the decision of Cardus and Edith King to marry, on 17 June 1921. The marriage, which lasted until Edith&#x27;s death 47 years later, was unconventional; the couple led individual lives and rarely lived together, while remaining devoted friends. Cardus described his wife as &quot;a great spirit and character, born for sisterhood not marriage.&quot;
From this time onward, Cardus used the forename &quot;Neville&quot; in place of &quot;Fred&quot;, and adopted the initials &quot;N.C.&quot; for his music reviews, to distinguish this persona from &quot;Cricketer&quot;. In August 1921 Cardus gained what he termed &quot;the only scoop of my career&quot;, when he reported the unexpected victory by 28 runs of MacLaren&#x27;s scratch side over the previously unbeaten Australian touring team. The match, at The Saffrons ground at Eastbourne, had attracted little interest from other cricket correspondents, being treated as a foregone conclusion.

The focus of much of Cardus&#x27;s cricket writing was the Lancashire side of the inter-war years, and in particular their twice-yearly battles with rivals Yorkshire. His eye was as much on the players and their personalities as on the game, on &quot;the match within the match&quot;, with the actual scores treated as secondary. Cardus justified this: &quot;Do I add up the notes of a Mozart &quot;Vivace&quot; to evaluate the music?&quot; To meet Cardus&#x27;s requirements, the players were sometimes &quot;enlarged&quot;, notably Emmott Robinson, the veteran Yorkshire all-rounder of the 1920s who through Cardus&#x27;s pen became &quot;the apotheosis of Yorkshire cricket and Yorkshire character&quot;. In the 1930s, Cardus&#x27;s style became less effusive, as his older heroes were replaced by players with, in his view, less romantic appeal. Bradman was an exception; after his exploits in the England versus Australia Test series of 1930 Cardus described the Australian as &quot;an incredible exponent who in himself sums up all the skill and experience that have gone before him ... he has kindled grand bonfires of batsmanship for us&quot;.

Selections from Cardus&#x27;s &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; cricket writings were published in a series of books between 1922 and 1937. Because of financial constraints the paper did not send &quot;Cricketer&quot; to Australia to cover the &quot;Bodyline&quot; tour of 1932–33. Cardus was generally approving of Jardine&#x27;s controversial bodyline tactics, writing on 5 March 1933: &quot;[H]ad [Jardine] been a weak man, all the energy of Larwood [England&#x27;s premier bowler] might have proved as vain a thing as it did in 1930&quot;. In 1936–37, Cardus accompanied the MCC team to Australia; otherwise he continued to write on English domestic cricket until the 1939 season was summarily truncated. On 1 September, the day that Germany invaded Poland, Cardus observed the removal of the bust of W. G. Grace from the Lord&#x27;s pavilion; he was informed by a bystander: &quot;That means war&quot;. It has been argued that this should be regarded as a good story rather than literal truth: there was no match at Lord&#x27;s that day, and Cardus was on holiday in Derbyshire.

===Music critic===
Following Langford&#x27;s death in May 1927, Cardus became &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;″s chief music critic. For several years he had worked closely with Langford, whose influence on the younger man was equalled only by that of Ernest Newman, Langford&#x27;s predecessor as the paper&#x27;s music critic: &quot;Langford taught me to feel and translate, while Newman taught me to observe and analyse&quot;. Cardus&#x27;s fellow-critic Hugo Cole has described his approach as personal rather than academic, based on his own reactions to the music he was hearing, and with a complete independence of judgement. Cardus was, Cole says, &quot;the last distinguished music critic never to have received formal musical training ... he was a writer first, and a music critic second&quot;.

Cardus&#x27;s lack of deference sometimes led to friction, as with Hamilton Harty, chief conductor of the Hallé Orchestra from 1920. In his reviews of the Hallé concerts until Harty&#x27;s departure in 1933, Cardus frequently criticised the conductor&#x27;s choices and interpretations. On one occasion he observed that Harty&#x27;s rendering of the adagio in Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth had broken the world record for slowness, and quoted minutes and seconds. Responding to Harty&#x27;s outraged protests, Cardus threatened to bring an alarm clock to the next performance, &quot;less for critical purposes than for those of personal convenience&quot;. When Harty left, he was not replaced as chief conductor; the Hallé employed distinguished visiting conductors such as Beecham, Malcolm Sargent, Pierre Monteux, Adrian Boult and Ernest Ansermet. Cardus considered that a lack of central direction was adversely affecting the orchestra, and his biting criticisms of some performances led to temporarily strained relations.

Cardus often expressed views contrary to popular and critical opinion. He dismissed Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; as &quot;a sophisticated exploitation of primitive rum-ti-tum&quot;. When Harty introduced Gershwin&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;An American in Paris&quot; into a Hallé concert, Cardus proposed &quot;a 150 per cent [import] tariff against this sort of American dry-goods&quot;. He professed to think that Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;preoccupation with comic opera, to the neglect of oratorio and symphony&quot; was a &quot;deplorable&quot; loss to English music, although he also wrote that without Gilbert, nothing of Sullivan&#x27;s music would have survived. Cardus championed Delius against the consensus of his fellow-critics: &quot;His music looks back on days intensely lived through; it knows the pathos of mortal things doomed to fade and vanish&quot;. At the 1929 Delius Festival in London, Cardus briefly met the composer, who thought he looked too young to be &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;″s music critic, and counselled him: &quot;Don&#x27;t read yourself daft. Trust to y&#x27;r emotions&quot;. Also against the grain of critical opinion, Cardus commended the then unfashionable music of Richard Strauss and Anton Bruckner.

In 1931 Cardus visited the Salzburg Festival, where he met Beecham and began a friendship which lasted until Sir Thomas&#x27;s death in 1961—despite numerous disagreements. One of Cardus&#x27;s notices in 1937 so incensed Beecham that he announced he would not conduct any concert at which Cardus was present. Cardus later numbered Beecham, with Elgar and Delius, as &quot;one of the three most original spirits known in English music since Purcell&quot;. The annual Salzburg Festival became a highlight of Cardus&#x27;s musical calendar; in 1936 he saw Toscanini conduct a performance there of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot; that, he said, &quot;will remain in the mind for a lifetime ... Toscanini held us like children listening to a tale told in the chimney corner, lighted by the glow of olden times&quot;. Cardus&#x27;s final prewar Salzburg visit was in 1938, just after the German-Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; which led to the withdrawal in protest of many of the Festival&#x27;s leading figures.

Despite financial incentives from London newspapers, Cardus remained loyal to &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;. On the outbreak of war in September 1939 the Free Trade Hall closed, requisitioned for military purposes. The Hallé Society left Manchester to tour with Sargent around the north-west of England. With no music in Manchester and all first-class cricket suspended, Cardus was unemployed, &quot;imprisoned in Manchester, useless to anybody&quot;. Thus, when he received an offer from Sir Keith Murdoch to join &quot;The Herald&quot; of Melbourne in Australia, he accepted immediately.

==Australia==

Cardus had been known to Australian readers since the 1920s, when &quot;The Argus&quot; in Melbourne reported his view that Australians made cricket &quot;a war game ... with an intensity of purpose too deadly for a mere game.&quot; His books on cricket were widely reviewed in the Australian press in the 1920s and 30s; one critic commented in 1929, &quot;Mr. Cardus mingles fancy with fact. The latter is preferable.&quot; Another Australian writer, quoting him extensively in 1932, observed, &quot;Mr. Cardus is a gifted writer and a most impartial critic.&quot; By 1936 he was known to a considerable section of the Australian public as a cricket writer, although he was hardly known there in his musical capacity.

The 1936–37 MCC tour of Australia under G.O. Allen was the occasion of Cardus&#x27;s first visit to the country. During the tour he made, or consolidated, friendships with players and colleagues including C. B. Fry and Donald Bradman. Fry, a former England cricket captain, was a boyhood hero of Cardus, and was covering the Tests for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. In Bradman, Cardus found a sophistication and sensitivity that other writers had failed to detect. When interviewed on his arrival in Australia, Cardus speculated how he would cope for the six months of the tour without music; he was touched when the following day music students in Perth gave him a private recital of music by Chopin and Hugo Wolf. During this tour Cardus wrote for &quot;The Herald&quot; in Melbourne, and broadcast about cricket on Australian radio.

Cardus made a private visit to Australia from mid-January to mid-March 1938. When he joined &quot;The Herald&quot; in 1940, his initial brief was to cover a series of concerts conducted by Beecham for the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC). Daily contact between the two men during Beecham&#x27;s time in Australia between June and October 1940 helped to consolidate their friendship. At the end of his tour Beecham tried to persuade Cardus to join him in sailing to America, asking, &quot;Do you propose to stay in this barbarous country all your life?&quot; Cardus insisted on remaining in Australia, but moved from Melbourne to Sydney. Concluding that he could not satisfactorily review concerts for an evening newspaper, he joined the staff of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald (SMH)&quot;.

At first Cardus failed to adjust his expectations to the prevailing standard of music-making in Australia, which was not at that
time comparable to the best on offer in Europe or America. He was accused of being &quot;just one more sneering Pommy bastard come to hand down higher wisdom to the ignorant colonials.&quot; His biographer Christopher Brookes suggests that Cardus was applying critical standards &quot;more appropriate to Salzburg than to Sydney&quot;. Over the next two years Cardus and the public slowly came to terms with each other, and by 1942 he was both popular and respected among Australians.
For ABC Cardus presented a weekly hour-long programme, &quot;The Enjoyment of Music&quot;, which enlarged the audience for classical music across the country. His topics included concert works, such as the late Beethoven string quartets and Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, operas including &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot;, and performers such as Wilhelm Furtwängler and Arturo Toscanini. He also gave a weekly, fifteen-minute talk on music, illustrated by records, for the children&#x27;s Argonauts Club programme and regularly wrote for &quot;ABC Weekly&quot;.

Cardus rented a small flat in the Kings Cross district of Sydney, where he wrote his &quot;Ten Composers&quot; (1945) and &quot;Autobiography&quot; (1947). He said later that he found the discipline of writing for seven hours a day difficult at first, but that the process had turned him from a journalist into something more substantial. After his wife announced her intention of sailing from England in 1941 to join him, Cardus declined to move to a larger flat to accommodate them both, and rented a separate establishment for her a mile away. They dined together once a week, but otherwise continued to lead largely separate lives.

By the end of the war Cardus&#x27;s thoughts were turning to England. Refusing an offer of a highly paid permanent contract to cover both music and cricket for the &quot;SMH&quot; he considered his options; with some reluctance he agreed to cover the MCC&#x27;s 1946–47 tour of Australia for the &quot;SMH&quot; and also for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;. The novelist Charles Morgan wrote of Cardus&#x27;s reports, &quot;the best [I have] read these 40 years. Who shall dare to say now that George Meredith is forgotten?&quot;

==Later career==

===Years of uncertainty===
In April 1947 Cardus returned to England. He had not as yet decided to leave Australia permanently, but &quot;felt in need of spiritual refreshment&quot;. He found a war-weary England in which much had changed; familiar landmarks had disappeared, and old friends and acquaintances had died. The Free Trade Hall was a burnt-out shell, and the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London completely destroyed; however, Cardus was struck by the apparent good health of the English music scene. He also found an undamaged Lord&#x27;s, and enjoyed a season of magnificent cricket, marked by the batting exploits of the Middlesex pair, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich. Cardus was back in Sydney by the end of the year, but early in 1948, having accepted an offer from &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; to cover that year&#x27;s Test series against Australia, he left for England again.

Another factor that brought Cardus to England in 1948 was the prospect of succeeding Newman, whose retirement as chief music critic of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; was assumed to be imminent. However, Newman had no intention of retiring, and made it clear that he would resent any successor-designate looking over his shoulder. Feeling slighted, Cardus resigned from the paper and accepted an offer from the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; to be its music critic. This new appointment was short-lived; Cardus&#x27;s lengthy and discursive concert reviews were incompatible with this paper&#x27;s style, and were ruthlessly cut by subeditors. At the end of 1948 he was back in Australia, proclaiming his intention to settle there permanently. This determination, too, was brief; the lure of London life proved irresistible. Because of the commercial success of his &quot;Autobiography&quot;, published in 1947, and the immediate commissioning of a second autobiographical work, Cardus was not under immediate financial pressure. He left Australia again in the spring of 1949, and although he spent the English winter of 1950–51 in Australia, writing about the 1950–51 England v. Australia Test series for the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, London was thereafter his permanent home. Here he worked as a freelance writer, in which role he resumed his association with &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;. In December 1951 he was appointed the paper&#x27;s London music critic, on a permanent salaried basis.

===London critic===

In 1949 Cardus set up his London home at the National Liberal Club, while Edith took a flat in Bickenhall Mansions, just off Baker Street. The pair lived harmoniously apart, though in frequent contact, until Edith&#x27;s death. Cardus found London&#x27;s musical life invigorating, with five major orchestras and a host of distinguished conductors and solo artists performing regularly. Toscanini paid his final visit to England in 1952, with two concerts at the Royal Festival Hall. Outside London, Cardus was a regular visitor to the Edinburgh Festival and to Glyndebourne, and was in Manchester for the reopening of the Free Trade Hall and the &quot;homecoming&quot; of the Hallé Orchestra in November 1951. The inaugural concert concluded with Kathleen Ferrier singing &quot;Land of Hope and Glory&quot;. Cardus had first heard Ferrier at the Edinburgh Festival in 1947; he became a devoted admirer to the extent that, eventually, questions were raised about his critical blindness to her technical weaknesses. He wrote of her singing that it was, &quot;like the woman herself ... imbued with a quiet but reliant sense and a feeling for the fun and goodness of life&quot;. He was devastated by her death from cancer in October 1953; the following year he edited and contributed to a memorial volume of tributes.

For &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, Cardus wrote around 30 music articles a year. These included &quot;survey&quot; pieces, which often reflected his personal enthusiasms; a regular subject was the music of Gustav Mahler, who in the early 1950s was by no means a popular composer with British audiences. Cardus sought to change that, with a series of articles between 1952 and 1957 under titles such as &quot;Mahler&#x27;s Growing Influence&quot;, &quot;Misunderstanding Mahler&quot;, and &quot;The Mahler Problem&quot;. He wrote the first volume of a detailed analysis entitled &quot;Gustav Mahler: His Mind and his Music&quot;; the book, dealing with Mahler&#x27;s first five symphonies, was published in 1965, but was poorly received by critics. Volume II was never written.

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s Cardus wrote cricket articles; these included an annual reflection for &quot;Wisden Cricketers&#x27; Almanack&quot; and occasional columns for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, for whom he covered the 1953 Test Matches against Australia. In the English winter of 1954–55 Cardus made his final visit to Australia, to report on the Test series for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;; he undertook to write &quot;impressions&quot; rather than day-to-day reports on play. He found time to enjoy Sydney&#x27;s theatrical and music scene, but was disappointed in what he perceived as a decline in the city&#x27;s musical standards.

In the decades after the war many of Cardus&#x27;s earlier heroes and acquaintances died. On Fry&#x27;s death in 1956 Cardus wrote of him as &quot;A great Englishman, measured by any standards of occupation, art and civilisation&quot;. In 1959, still in harness, Newman died at the age of 90; Cardus considered him the most outstanding of all music critics, and thought he should have been appointed a Companion of Honour (CH), or even to the Order of Merit. Beecham died on 8 March 1961. Cardus had for some years noted a decline in his old friend&#x27;s powers, though he had written in 1954, on the occasion of Beecham&#x27;s 75th birthday, of the debt the music world owed to the conductor: &quot;He led us out of the Teutonic captivity. He showed us other and more sensitive worlds&quot;. After Beecham&#x27;s death, Cardus organised the publication of a celebratory memoir, as he had done with Kathleen Ferrier. To an extent the departed idols were replaced with new heroes: in music, Herbert von Karajan, Otto Klemperer, Clifford Curzon and Claudio Arrau; in cricket, Keith Miller and Garfield Sobers. Cardus maintained a keen antagonism towards much of contemporary music; discussing Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Pli selon pli&quot; after a performance in 1965, he said he &quot;could not relate the varied succession of aural phenomena to music as my musical intelligence and senses recognise music&quot;.

In 1964 Cardus was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). In a letter to his friend Marjorie Robinson he described the investiture at Buckingham Palace, remarking that the Queen &quot;might have been any nice shy young lady in D.H. Evans or Kendal Milnes&quot;. Just over two years later Cardus was awarded a knighthood, the first music critic to receive such an honour, although in all likelihood it was awarded as much for his cricket writing. Years previously Beecham had advised: &quot;In the unlikely event of you being offered a knighthood, Neville, take it. It makes tables at the Savoy so much easier to come by&quot;.

===Final years===
Edith Cardus died on 26 March 1968. Despite their separate day-to-day lives, she had been an influential presence for nearly all Cardus&#x27;s adult life; they had communicated by telephone almost daily, and he felt her loss keenly. After her death he left the National Liberal Club and moved into her flat, which remained his base for the rest of his life. In the ensuing months he worried about his deteriorating relationship with &quot;The Guardian&quot;; the paper had been renamed in 1959 following reorganisation, and its editorial offices had moved to London in 1964. Cardus felt that much of the old ethos had departed, and that his once-sacrosanct copy was now at the mercy of subeditors. He was particularly incensed by the treatment meted out to his 1969 Edinburgh Festival reports, and referred to the subeditors&#x27; room as &quot;the Abattoir&quot; in one of many letters complaining of editorial butchery.

As well as his work for &quot;The Guardian&quot; Cardus wrote occasionally for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, a particular pleasure to him in view of his failure to achieve Newman&#x27;s post. In 1970 he published &quot;Full Score&quot;, the last of his autobiographical works and, in Daniels&#x27;s view, the least substantial of all the Cardus books. In his eighties, Cardus assumed the role of guru to young aspiring writers, before whom he would hold court in favourite locations: the Garrick Club, the National Liberal Club, or Lord&#x27;s. According to Daniels, Cardus &quot;thrived in the role of patron, encourager, [and] &quot;accoucheur&quot;&quot;. Howat describes his appearance in these years as not having changed much from his younger days: &quot;... the lean, ascetic figure of moderate height, with sharp features, sleek hair, and strong glasses&quot;.

Cardus died on 28 February 1975 at the Nuffield Clinic, London, a few days after collapsing at home. His cremation service was private. On 4 April more than 200 people attended a memorial service at St Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden. These included representatives from Cardus&#x27;s worlds of cricket, journalism and music. Flora Robson and Wendy Hiller gave readings, and Clifford Curzon, with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, played the second movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 23. The eulogy was given by the cricket writer and historian Alan Gibson, who took as his text verses from Blake&#x27;s &quot;Auguries of Innocence&quot;:
==Reputation, honours and influence==
Cardus&#x27;s contribution to cricket writing has been acknowledged by various commentators on the game. John Arlott wrote: &quot;Before him, cricket was reported ... with him it was for the first time appreciated, felt, and imaginatively described.&quot; Howat commented: &quot;He would have his imitators and parodists, and no serious cricket writer would remain unaffected by him&quot;. His influence on his successors was more specifically acknowledged by Gibson:

&quot;All cricket writers of the last half century have been influenced by Cardus, whether they admit it or not, whether they have wished to be or not, whether they have tried to copy him or tried to avoid copying him. He was not a model, any more than Macaulay, say, was a model for the aspiring historian. But just as Macaulay changed the course of the writing of history, Cardus changed the course of the writing of cricket. He showed what could be done. He dignified and illuminated the craft&quot;.

As a music critic, Cardus&#x27;s romantic, instinctive approach was the opposite of Newman&#x27;s objective school of musical criticism. Initially in awe of Newman&#x27;s reputation, Cardus soon discovered his own independent, more subjective voice. A fellow critic wrote that Newman &quot;probed into Music&#x27;s vitals, put her head under deep X-ray and analysed cell-tissue. Cardus laid his head against her bosom and listened to the beating of her heart.&quot; Despite their different approaches, the two writers held each other in considerable regard; at times, Newman&#x27;s own prose showed the influence of Cardus&#x27;s style. Among leading musicians who have paid tribute to Cardus, Yehudi Menuhin wrote that he &quot;reminds us that there is an understanding of the heart as well as of the mind ... in Neville Cardus, the artist has an ally&quot;. Colin Davis highlighted &quot;the quality and verve of Cardus&#x27;s writing&quot;, which had made him a household name.

Beside his CBE and knighthood, Cardus received numerous honours from the musical and cricketing worlds, at home and overseas. In 1963 he was awarded the City of Bayreuth&#x27;s Wagner Medal; he was given honorary membership of the Royal Manchester College of Music in 1968, and of the Royal Academy of Music in 1972. The Hallé Orchestra honoured him with two special concerts in April 1966 to mark his long association with the orchestra. In 1970 he received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class. Among the honours he most valued was the presidency, for two years, of Lancashire County Cricket Club, which he accepted in 1971.

Cardus was not an &quot;establishment&quot; figure. His friends encountered initial resistance when they sought his election to the MCC, although he was eventually accepted in 1958. He was denied the civic honour of the Freedom of the City of Manchester, and although he made light of this omission he was hurt by it. Long after his death, the city named a pathway close to the rebuilt Summer Place &quot;Neville Cardus Walk&quot;. Aside from formal institutional recognition, Cardus was highly regarded by prominent individual cricketers and musicians, as indicated by the &quot;tribute book&quot; he received at his 70th birthday celebration lunch. The book included contributions from Wilfred Rhodes, Jack Hobbs and Len Hutton, and also from Klemperer, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Bruno Walter. He managed to maintain close friendships with both Beecham and Sir John Barbirolli, though the two conductors cordially disliked one another.

In the conventional sense, Cardus was not a religious man; Dennis Silk, a one-time MCC president, suggests that Cardus&#x27;s religion was &quot;friendship&quot;. In &quot;Autobiography&quot; Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, &quot;the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent&quot;—though his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, when he came to understand the late string quartets of Beethoven. He ends his autobiography by declaring: &quot;If I know that my Redeemer liveth it is not on the church&#x27;s testimony, but because of what Handel affirms&quot;.

Within the relaxed framework of his marriage, Cardus enjoyed relationships with many women. These included Hilda &quot;Barbe&quot; Ede, with whom he shared a passionate affair in the 1930s before her sudden death in 1937; Cardus referred to her as &quot;Milady&quot;, and devoted a chapter of &quot;Full Score&quot; to her. After his return from Australia his closest women friends were Margaret Hughes and Else Mayer-Lismann, to whom he referred respectively as his &quot;cricket wife&quot; and his &quot;music wife&quot;. Hughes, who was more than 30 years younger than Cardus, became his literary executor after his death, and edited several collections of his cricketing and musical writings.

<text>In mathematics, Monte Carlo integration is a technique for numerical integration using random numbers. It is a particular Monte Carlo method that numerically computes a definite integral. While other algorithms usually evaluate the integrand at a regular grid, Monte Carlo randomly chooses points at which the integrand is evaluated. This method is particularly useful for higher-dimensional integrals.

There are different methods to perform a Monte Carlo integration, such as uniform sampling, stratified sampling, importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (also known as a particle filter), and mean-field particle methods.

== Overview ==
In numerical integration, methods such as the trapezoidal rule use a deterministic approach. Monte Carlo integration, on the other hand, employs a non-deterministic approach: each realization provides a different outcome. In Monte Carlo, the final outcome is an approximation of the correct value with respective error bars, and the correct value is likely to be within those error bars.

The problem Monte Carlo integration addresses is the computation of a multidimensional definite integral
formula_1
where Ω, a subset of formula_2, has volume
formula_3

The naive Monte Carlo approach is to sample points uniformly on Ω: given &quot;N&quot; uniform samples,
formula_4

&quot;I&quot; can be approximated by
formula_5

This is because the law of large numbers ensures that
formula_6

Given the estimation of &quot;I&quot; from &quot;QN&quot;, the error bars of &quot;QN&quot; can be estimated by the sample variance using the unbiased estimate of the variance.

formula_7
which leads to
formula_8

Since the sequence
formula_9
is bounded due to being identically equal to &quot;Var(f)&quot;, as long as this is assumed finite, this variance decreases asymptotically to zero as 1/&quot;N&quot;. The estimation of the error of &quot;QN&quot; is thus
formula_10
which decreases as formula_11. This is standard error of the mean multiplied with formula_12. 
This result does not depend on the number of dimensions of the integral, which is the promised advantage of Monte Carlo integration against most deterministic methods that depend exponentially on the dimension. 
It is important to notice that, unlike in deterministic methods, the estimate of the error is not a strict error bound; random sampling may not uncover all the important features of the integrand that can result in an underestimate of the error.

While the naive Monte Carlo works for simple examples, an improvement over deterministic algorithms can only be accomplished with algorithms that use problem-specific sampling distributions.
With an appropriate sample distribution it is possible to exploit the fact that almost all higher-dimensional integrands are very localized and only small subspace notably contributes to the integral.
A large part of the Monte Carlo literature is dedicated in developing strategies to improve the error estimates. In particular, stratified sampling—dividing the region in sub-domains—and importance sampling—sampling from non-uniform distributions—are two examples of such techniques.

=== Example ===
A paradigmatic example of a Monte Carlo integration is the estimation of π. Consider the function
formula_13
and the set Ω = [−1,1] × [−1,1] with &quot;V&quot; = 4. Notice that
formula_14

Thus, a crude way of calculating the value of π with Monte Carlo integration is to pick &quot;N&quot; random numbers on Ω and compute
formula_15

In the figure on the right, the relative error formula_16 is measured as a function of &quot;N&quot;, confirming the formula_11.

=== C/C++ example ===

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;time.h&gt;
int main() {
 // Initialize the number of counts to 0, setting the total number to be 100000 in the loop.
 int throws = 99999, insideCircle = 0;
 double randX, randY, pi;

 srand(time(NULL));

 // Checks for each random pair of x and y if they are inside circle of radius 1.
 for (int i = 0; i &lt; throws; i++) {
 randX = rand() / (double) RAND_MAX;
 randY = rand() / (double) RAND_MAX;
 if (randX * randX + randY * randY &lt; 1) {
 insideCircle++;
 }

 // Calculating pi and printing.
 pi = 4.0 * insideCircle / throws;
 printf(&quot;%lf\n&quot;, pi);


=== Python example ===
Made in Python. 

import numpy as np

rng = np.random.default_rng(0)

throws = 2000
radius = 1

# Choose random X and Y data centered around 0,0
x = rng.uniform(-radius, radius, throws)
y = rng.uniform(-radius, radius, throws)

# Count the times (x, y) is inside the circle,
# which happens when sqrt(x^2 + y^2) &lt;= radius.
inside_circle = np.count_nonzero(np.hypot(x, y) &lt;= radius)

# Calculate area and print; should be closer to Pi with increasing number of throws
area = (2 * radius)**2 * inside_circle / throws
print(area)
=== Wolfram Mathematica example ===
The code below describes a process of integrating the function
formula_18
from formula_19 using the Monte-Carlo method in Mathematica:
func[x_] := 1/(1 + Sinh[2*x]*(Log[x])^2);

(*Sample from truncated normal distribution to speed up convergence*)
Distrib[x_, average_, var_] := PDF[NormalDistribution[average, var], 1.1*x - 0.1];
n = 10;
RV = RandomVariate[TruncatedDistribution[{0.8, 3}, NormalDistribution[1, 0.399]], n];
Int = 1/n Total[func[RV]/Distrib[RV, 1, 0.399]]*Integrate[Distrib[x, 1, 0.399], {x, 0.8, 3}]

NIntegrate[func[x], {x, 0.8, 3}] (*Compare with real answer*)
== Recursive stratified sampling ==

Recursive stratified sampling is a generalization of one-dimensional adaptive quadratures to multi-dimensional integrals. On each recursion step the integral and the error are estimated using a plain Monte Carlo algorithm. If the error estimate is larger than the required accuracy the integration volume is divided into sub-volumes and the procedure is recursively applied to sub-volumes.

The ordinary &#x27;dividing by two&#x27; strategy does not work for multi-dimensions as the number of sub-volumes grows far too quickly to keep track. Instead one estimates along which dimension a subdivision should bring the most dividends and only subdivides the volume along this dimension.

The stratified sampling algorithm concentrates the sampling points in the regions where the variance of the function is largest thus reducing the grand variance and making the sampling more effective, as shown on the illustration.

The popular MISER routine implements a similar algorithm.

=== MISER Monte Carlo ===
The MISER algorithm is based on recursive stratified sampling. This technique aims to reduce the overall integration error by concentrating integration points in the regions of highest variance.

The idea of stratified sampling begins with the observation that for two disjoint regions &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; with Monte Carlo estimates of the integral formula_20 and formula_21 and variances formula_22 and formula_23, the variance Var(&quot;f&quot;) of the combined estimate
formula_24
is given by,
formula_25

It can be shown that this variance is minimized by distributing the points such that,
formula_26

Hence the smallest error estimate is obtained by allocating sample points in proportion to the standard deviation of the function in each sub-region.

The MISER algorithm proceeds by bisecting the integration region along one coordinate axis to give two sub-regions at each step. The direction is chosen by examining all &quot;d&quot; possible bisections and selecting the one which will minimize the combined variance of the two sub-regions. The variance in the sub-regions is estimated by sampling with a fraction of the total number of points available to the current step. The same procedure is then repeated recursively for each of the two half-spaces from the best bisection. The remaining sample points are allocated to the sub-regions using the formula for &quot;Na&quot; and &quot;Nb&quot;. This recursive allocation of integration points continues down to a user-specified depth where each sub-region is integrated using a plain Monte Carlo estimate. These individual values and their error estimates are then combined upwards to give an overall result and an estimate of its error.

== Importance sampling ==
There are a variety of importance sampling algorithms, such as 
=== Importance sampling algorithm ===

Importance sampling provides a very important tool to perform Monte-Carlo integration. The main result of importance sampling to this method is that the uniform sampling of formula_27 is a particular case of a more generic choice, on which the samples are drawn from any distribution formula_28. The idea is that formula_28 can be chosen to decrease the variance of the measurement &quot;QN&quot;.

Consider the following example where one would like to numerically integrate a gaussian function, centered at 0, with σ = 1, from −1000 to 1000. Naturally, if the samples are drawn uniformly on the interval [−1000, 1000], only a very small part of them would be significant to the integral. This can be improved by choosing a different distribution from where the samples are chosen, for instance by sampling according to a gaussian distribution centered at 0, with σ = 1. Of course the &quot;right&quot; choice strongly depends on the integrand.

Formally, given a set of samples chosen from a distribution
formula_30
the estimator for &quot;I&quot; is given by
formula_31

Intuitively, this says that if we pick a particular sample twice as much as other samples, we weight it half as much as the other samples. This estimator is naturally valid for uniform sampling, the case where formula_28 is constant.

The Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is one of the most used algorithms to generate formula_27 from formula_28, thus providing an efficient way of computing integrals.

=== VEGAS Monte Carlo ===
The VEGAS algorithm approximates the exact distribution by making a number of passes over the integration region which creates the histogram of the function &quot;f&quot;. Each histogram is used to define a sampling distribution for the next pass. Asymptotically this procedure converges to the desired distribution. In order to avoid the number of histogram bins growing like &quot;Kd&quot;, the probability distribution is approximated by a separable function:
formula_35
so that the number of bins required is only &quot;Kd&quot;. This is equivalent to locating the peaks of the function from the projections of the integrand onto the coordinate axes. The efficiency of VEGAS depends on the validity of this assumption. It is most efficient when the peaks of the integrand are well-localized. If an integrand can be rewritten in a form which is approximately separable this will increase the efficiency of integration with VEGAS. VEGAS incorporates a number of additional features, and combines both stratified sampling and importance sampling.

<doc id="1112969" wikidata="Q3162707" url="?curid=1112969" title="Jared Taylor">
<text>Samuel Jared Taylor (born September 15, 1951) is an American white supremacist and editor of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, an online magazine espousing such opinions, which was founded by Taylor in 1990.

He is also the president of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;″s parent organization, New Century Foundation, through which many of his books have been published. He is a former member of the advisory board of &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot; and a former director of the National Policy Institute, a Virginia-based white nationalist think tank. He is also a board member and spokesperson of the Council of Conservative Citizens.

Taylor and many of his affiliated organizations are accused of promoting racist ideologies by civil rights groups, news media, and academics studying racism in the United States.

== Early life and education ==
Taylor was born on September 15, 1951, to Christian missionary parents from Virginia in Kobe, Japan. He lived in Japan until he was 16 years old and attended Japanese schools up to the age of 12, becoming fluent in Japanese.

He attended Yale University, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1973. Taylor then spent three years in France and received a Master of Arts degree in international economics at Sciences Po in 1978. During a period that interrupted his undergraduate and later graduate college years, he worked and traveled extensively in West Africa, improving his French in the Francophone regions of the continent. Taylor is fluent in French, Japanese, and English.

==Career==
Taylor worked as an international lending officer for the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation from 1978 to 1981, and as West Coast editor of &quot;PC Magazine&quot; from 1983 to 1988. He has also taught Japanese at the Harvard Summer School, and worked as a courtroom translator.

In the 1980s, at the time of the country&#x27;s strong economic growth, Taylor was viewed as a &quot;Japan expert&quot; in the mainstream media. In 1983 he published a well-received book on Japanese culture and business customs entitled &quot;Shadows of the Rising Sun: A Critical View of the Japanese Miracle&quot;. While critical of certain aspects of Japanese culture, Taylor argued that Japanese society was more successful in solving social issues than the West, with lower crime rates and a similar or higher standard of living.

Sometime in his early thirties, Taylor reassessed the liberal and cosmopolitan viewpoint commonly professed in his working environment, which he had himself shared until then. He became deeply convinced that human beings are tribal in nature and feelings, and that they differ in talent, temperament and capacity. In the mid-1980s, he developed an interest in the emerging fields of evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology, especially in the controversial works of Richard Lynn, J. Philippe Rushton and Helmuth Nyborg, and came to believe that differences between human beings are largely of genetic origin, and therefore quasi-immutable. All the social miracles of Japan, Taylor averred by 1991 under the pen name Steven Howell, were at least partly a result of Japan&#x27;s racial and cultural homogeneity.

In November 1990, he founded and published the first issue of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, a white supremacist subscription-based monthly newsletter. He created the New Century Foundation in 1994 to assist with the running of &quot;American Renaissance&quot;. Many of the early articles were written by Taylor himself and were intended to put white racial advocacy on a higher intellectual level than the traditional Klansman&#x27;s or white skinhead&#x27;s discourse that dominated the media at that time. The journal ceased its print publication in 2012 to focus on a daily webzine format.

In 1992, Taylor published a book titled &quot;Paved with Good Intentions&quot; in which he criticizes what he deems the unwise welfare politics that contributed to the economic situation of the African-American underclass. Unlike many of his &quot;American Renaissance&quot; articles, the work avoids genetic-based reasoning due to fears of not being able to get it published had he talked about IQ differences. In 1994, he was called by the defense team in a Fort Worth, Texas black-on-black murder trial, to give expert testimony on the race-related aspects of the case. Prior to testifying in the trial, Taylor, presented as a &quot;race-relations expert and author&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called young black men &quot;the most dangerous people in America&quot; and added &quot;This must be taken into consideration in judging whether or not it was realistic for [the defendant] to think this was a kill-or-be-killed situation.&quot;

==Views==
Taylor has been described as a white nationalist, white supremacist, and racist by civil rights groups, news media, academics studying racism in the US, and others. Taylor has &quot;strenuously rejected&quot; being called a racist, and maintains that he is instead a &quot;racialist who believes in race-realism.&quot; He has also disputed the white supremacist label, preferring to describe himself as a &quot;white advocate&quot;, and contends that his views on nationality and race are &quot;moderate, commonsensical, and fully consistent with the views of most of the great statesmen and presidents of America&#x27;s past&quot;.

News coverage of Taylor has associated him with the alt-right.

===Race===
Taylor is a proponent of scientific racism and voluntary racial segregation. Taylor also asserts that there are racial differences in intelligence among the various ethno-racial groups across the world. Taylor argues that Blacks are generally less intelligent than Hispanics, while Hispanics are generally less intelligent than whites, and whites are generally less intelligent than East Asians: &quot;I think Asians are objectively superior to Whites by just about any measure that you can come up with in terms of what are the ingredients for a successful society. This doesn&#x27;t mean that I want America to become Asian. I think every people has a right to be itself, and this becomes clear whether we&#x27;re talking about Irian Jaya or Tibet, for that matter&quot;.

Taylor describes himself as an advocate for white interests. He states that his publication, &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, was founded to provide a voice for such concerns, and argues that its work is analogous to other groups that advocate for ethnic or racial interests. &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, however, has been described as a white supremacist publication and a &quot;forum for writers disparaging the abilities of minorities&quot;. In the journal in 2005, he stated, &quot;Blacks and whites are different. When blacks are left entirely to their own devices, Western civilization any kind of civilization disappears.&quot; A 2005 feature in the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; described Taylor as &quot;a racist in the guise of expert&quot;.

Taylor presents his segregationist project as based on civil liberties and freedom of association, and has described government-mandated segregation as morally unjust. He believes that all anti-discrimination laws &quot;from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 onward&quot; are an unacceptable expansion of federal power. Taylor also opposes anti-miscegenation laws as impinging on the freedom of association of private citizens.

Taylor believes that the multi-racial American society is &quot;doomed to failure&quot;, and that non-white groups should not constitute a significant part of the American population, especially Hispanics, Africans, Afro-Caribbeans and Middle Easterners, although he also includes Northern Asians, whom he holds in high regard. He thus supports immigration policies that would favor white immigrants over other groups. Taylor has said: &quot;Whites deserve a homeland,&quot; and when questioned about the US immigration laws passed in 1965, under the Hart-Celler Act, said that &quot;Whites are making a terrible mistake by setting in motion forces that will reduce them to a minority.&quot;

Taylor supports the white genocide conspiracy theory, and has hosted the Suidlanders on his AmRen podcast to discuss the topic, while encouraging donations to the South African organization. He has recommended Jean Raspail&#x27;s &quot;The Camp of the Saints&quot; to his followers.

===Attitude towards antisemitism===
Taylor welcomes Jews to his organization and views American Jews as potential powerful allies. While several speakers of Jewish descent have participated in &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conventions, he has never sought to either welcome or expel anti-Semitic voices. This position has sparked tensions with far-right anti-Semitic organizations claiming that Jews are infiltrating their movements. In 2006, a clash erupted at one convention between anti-Semitic conspiracy theorist David Duke and Michael H. Hart, a Jewish astrophysicist sharing many of Taylor&#x27;s ideas. &quot;The Forward&quot; reported that Taylor &quot;has been trying to de-Nazify the movement and draw the white nationalist circle wider to include Jews of European descent. But to many on the far right, taking the Jew-hatred out of white nationalism is like taking the Christ out of Christmas—a sacrilege.&quot;

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) comments that Taylor is unusual among the radical right in &quot;his lack of anti-Semitism.&quot; Scholar Elizabeth Bryant Morgenstern states that &quot;unlike many other white supremacists, Taylor is not anti-Semitic, and in fact encourages Jews to join his fight. ... however many within the white supremacist/anti-immigration movement disagree with Taylor ... and he has been under tremendous pressure to break ties with the Jewish community.&quot;

===Donald Trump===
Taylor supported Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign, and recorded robocalls to support Trump before the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.

Taylor attended Trump&#x27;s inauguration with front-row VIP tickets, and he described the event as &quot;a sign of rising white consciousness&quot;.

A spokesperson told CNN that the candidate &quot;disavows all super PACs offering their support and continues to do so.&quot; When asked about the robocalls in an interview with CNN, Trump responded &quot;I would disavow that, but I will tell you people are extremely angry.&quot;

== Influence ==
Madison Grant, the author of &quot;The Passing of the Great Race&quot; (1916), and Lothrop Stoddard, the author of &quot;The Rising Tide of Color&quot; (1920), each the object of celebratory articles in &quot;American Renaissance&quot;, seem to have influenced or reinforced Taylor&#x27;s belief in separate racial homelands. Southern conservatives Samuel Francis and Sam Dickson, who have been regular speakers at &quot;American Renaissance&quot; conferences, are also cited as influential on Taylor&#x27;s views. According to scholar Russell Nieli, &quot;the combination of southern regional conservatism and Taylor&#x27;s experience of living in ... Japan has undoubtedly had a formative effect on his thinking about race.&quot;

Hoping his ethnonationalist project will go global, Taylor has sought in recent years to establish relations with populist radical right parties in Europe such as France&#x27;s National Rally, Britain&#x27;s UKIP, Austria&#x27;s Freedom Party, Germany&#x27;s Alternative für Deutschland, and Flanders&#x27;s Vlaams Belang. Nieli notes that Taylor appears to have a special intellectual affinity for the French New Right author Guillaume Faye, whose books were favorably reviewed by Taylor in &quot;American Renaissance&quot;; both of them believe that white people need to join in a worldwide fight for their racial, cultural, and demographic survival.

According to Nieli, Taylor &quot;may well have been as central to structuring the fledgling America&#x27;s radical Right] in the 1990s as the late William F. Buckley Jr. was in the 1950s and 1960s in structuring post-World War II American conservatism. The growing Alt Right movement in America today owes a great deal to Taylor&#x27;s past efforts.&quot;

==Reception==
The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Taylor as &quot;a courtly presenter of ideas that most would describe as crudely white supremacist—a kind of modern-day version of the refined but racist colonialist of old.&quot;

Mark Potok and Heidi Beirich, writers for the &quot;Intelligence Report&quot; (a publication of the SPLC), have written that &quot;Jared Taylor is the cultivated, cosmopolitan face of white supremacy. He is the guy who is providing the intellectual heft, in effect, to modern-day Klansmen.&quot; They have also stated that &quot;&quot;American Renaissance&quot; has become increasingly important over the years, bringing a measure of intellectualism and seriousness to the typically thug-dominated world of white supremacy&quot;.

On December 18, 2017, his account (as well as the account for &quot;American Renaissance&quot;) was suspended by Twitter, after Twitter adopted new rules prohibiting accounts affiliated with the promotion of violence. In February 2018, Taylor filed a lawsuit against Twitter, claiming that the suspension violated his right to free speech. Taylor&#x27;s lawsuit was dismissed, and an appeals court upheld the dismissal, agreeing that services can control what is published on their sites.

In March 2019, Taylor said on his website that he had been banned from the Schengen Area for two years at the instigation of Poland.

<text>The [[Governorate]] of the [[Río de la Plata]] (1549−1776) (, ) was one of the governorates of the Spanish Empire. It was created in 1549 by Spain in the area around the Río de la Plata. 

It was at first simply a renaming of the New Andalusia Governorate and included all of the land between 470 and 670 leagues south of the mouth of the Río Santiago along the Pacific coast. After 1617, Paraguay was separated under a separate administration (Asunción had been the capital of the governorate since Juan de Ayolas.)

After the founding of the Viceroyalty of Peru in 1542, the governorate was since its birth under its authority until the formation of the independent Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata in 1776. Similarly, it was under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Charcas until the formation of the independent Royal Audience of Buenos Aires from 1661 to 1671 and after 1783.

<text>Vla () is a Dutch dairy product made from fresh milk.

The word &quot;vla&quot; was first documented in the 13th century and originally referred to any custard-like substance covering cakes or other baked goods. The word &quot;vlaai&quot; is related and has since come to refer to a type of pie.

Traditionally &quot;vla&quot; is made with eggs, sugar and fresh milk, although some industrial producers use cornstarch rather than eggs today. &quot;Vla&quot; is available in many different flavors, of which vanilla is most popular. Other flavors include chocolate, caramel, banana, orange and apple.

&quot;Vla&quot; was originally sold in glass bottles and the consistency made extracting the complete amount difficult, so a special bottle scraper (&quot;flessenschraper&quot; or &quot;flessenlikker&quot;) was specifically designed. Despite the fact that &quot;vla&quot; is now normally sold in cartons, these scrapers are still common in Dutch family kitchens.

Although &quot;vla&quot; is originally a typical Dutch product, it was introduced to Wallonia and Germany by Campina in 2010 and has been sold in some stores there since then. It is also sold in Britain, though it is just called custard and is exclusively sold in tubs instead of cartons.

<text>The British Rail Class 377 &quot;[[Bombardier Electrostar|Electrostar]]&quot; is a British dual-voltage electric multiple unit passenger train (EMU) built by Bombardier Transportation on its Electrostar platform at Derby Litchurch Lane Works from 2001 to 2014.

==Description==

The trains work suburban services in South London, and main-line commuter services to Sussex, Surrey, Kent and the South Coast, on which they replaced 4Cig and 4Vep slam-door stock that was more than 40 years old and did not meet modern health and safety requirements. Built in the early 2000s, the units had a troubled introduction. Being fully air-conditioned, their higher power consumption compared to the trains they replaced led to major upgrades being required to the 750 V DC third-rail power supply used in the former Southern region. The collapse of Railtrack following the Hatfield accident further delayed this upgrade work, and the new stock did not enter squadron service until 2003.

Class 377s are fitted with external CCTV. There is an open area for wheelchairs, prams and cycles, and both intermediate coaches have toilets. Bodyside power doors are electrically operated, a move away from the air-powered systems of previous generation EMUs. Dual-voltage units are fitted with a Brecknell Willis high-speed pantograph, incorporating a pair of aerofoils on the pan knuckle to steady the pan head against the OLE contact wire.
The configuration of a 5-car Class 377 unit is:
* DMOC(A) – 2 motors on inner bogie, sander, auxiliary converter module
* MOSL – 2 motors on inner bogie, standard toilet (not found on 377/3s)
* PTSOL – pantograph, transformer, compressor, universal-access toilet
* MOS – 2 motors on inner bogie, standard-class interior (only found on Class 377/6 and 377/7 units)
* DMOS(B) – 2 motors on inner bogie, sander, auxiliary converter module

In the 4-car units the driving cars are composite. The first-class saloon is between the driving cab and the first set of passenger doors. 4-car units also do not contain the MOS coach.

===Couplers===
The Class 377 use Dellner instead of Tightlock couplings originally used on the Class 375s. Southern&#x27;s 375s were all reclassified to Class 377/3s upon conversion. These reclassified units can still be identified by their 3-car formation. Note that Southeastern&#x27;s 375s (sub-classes 375/3, 375/6, and 375/7) were also later converted from Tightlock to Dellner couplers but were not reclassified. Its sub-class 375/8 and 375/9 units were fitted with Dellner couplers, as built.

===Traction current supply===
All units can receive power via third-rail pick-up which provides 750 V DC. There are eight pick-up shoes per unit (twice the number of previous generation 4-car electric multiple units), and this enables them to ride smoothly over most third-rail gaps. The units in the 377/2, 377/5 and 377/7 sub-classes are dual-voltage, and are fitted with a pantograph to pick up 25 kV AC from overhead lines. On these units (and on single-voltage sub-class 377/6), the shoe mechanism is air-operated so that when powered down, or working on AC overhead lines, the shoe is raised out of the way. This is used on trains from Hemel Hempstead to Clapham Junction, which use part of the West Coast Main Line between Hemel Hempstead and Willesden Junction, and then the West London Line towards Clapham Junction. These trains change to third-rail DC supply on a dual-voltage section of the West London line north of Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. Since March 2009, dual-voltage Class 377 units operated some Thameslink Bedford to Brighton, Rochester and Ashford services (see below). The Bedford to Brighton services are now run by Class 700s, while the Class 377/5s themselves are now operated by Southeastern. 

Among the remaining units, the trailer coach in each unit has a recess in its roof where a pantograph could be fitted, to allow for future conversion to overhead AC power.

===Additional units and the Thameslink Programme===

In April 2007, as part of the Route Utilisation Strategy for the Brighton Main Line, it was announced that Southern would procure an additional 48 Class 377 carriages to replace an identical number of carriages (12 x 4-car units) due to be transferred to First Capital Connect. Eleven further dual-voltage units were then added to the order, making a total of 23. The units were commissioned at Southern&#x27;s Selhurst depot in Croydon before being transferred to First Capital Connect&#x27;s Bedford Cauldwell depot. The first of these, unit 377501, was delivered to Cauldwell depot on 27 February 2009 after making its first appearance through the Thameslink Central London core. The 377/5s operated mainly on Bedford to Brighton services but in the peaks formed part of First Capital Connect&#x27;s and Southeastern&#x27;s joint service to places such as Rochester and Ashford.

Delays in the construction of the Class 377/5s for First Capital Connect saw the temporary transfer of eight of Southern&#x27;s Class 377/2s to FCC to enable it to implement the planned timetable changes on 22 March 2009. The loss of these units until September 2009 was covered by the temporary cascade of a number of Class 350/1s to Southern from London Midland, which operated services between East Croydon and Milton Keynes.

In September 2011, it was announced that Southern had begun the procurement of 130 vehicles, due to delays in the procurement of new Thameslink rolling stock that would prevent transfer of the 377/5s in time for the December 2013 timetable change. The contract was awarded to Bombardier in December 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;377/6_announcement&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The additional eight five-car units (from an option in the contract for 40 additional vehicles) are dual-voltage and known as Class 377/7.

In December 2011, three Class 377/2 units were transferred from Southern to First Capital Connect to allow more 12-car services to operate.

During mid-2013, the first of the new Class 377/6s arrived from Derby for type testing, and since October 2013, these units have been used in passenger service, initially in peak-hour services on the Sutton and Mole Valley lines, Epsom Downs Branch, Tattenham Corner Line and the Caterham Line.

Southeastern received 25 Class 377 units (the 23 Class 377/5s and 2 Class 377/1s) in recent years, as specified in Department for Transport documents, published in September 2013, relating to the new combined Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern Franchise.

===Refurbishment===
Porterbrook is funding the £55 million five-year Project Aurora programme to refurbish 214 Class 377 Electrostars operated on Southern services. The work started in 2020 and is being done at Selhurst depot. 377 430 was the first unit to be completed in early 2021. Changes include the installation of screens showing live GTR and London Underground service information, the provision of USB and power points, energy-saving LED lighting and a passenger-counting system which will enable GTR to analyse how busy individual services are.

==Current operations==
=== Southern ===
* Mainline and Redhill Routes: London Victoria and London Bridge to Brighton, Reigate, Tonbridge, Eastbourne, Ore, Portsmouth, Southampton, Littlehampton and Bognor Regis
* East Coastway: Brighton to Seaford, Eastbourne, Hastings and Ore
* West Coastway: Brighton to Portsmouth, Littlehampton, Bognor Regis and Southampton
* West London Route: Clapham Junction to Watford Junction

* Outer Suburban services: London Victoria and London Bridge to Tattenham Corner, Epsom, Horsham and Dorking
* Inner Suburban services: London Victoria and London Bridge to Caterham, Sutton, Epsom Downs, West Croydon and Beckenham Junction via Crystal Palace

===Southeastern===
In December 2016 Southeastern (Govia) received 8 units (377501-377508), transferred from Thameslink. In September 2017 these were joined by an additional 17 units (377509-523 &amp; 377163/164)

Southeastern is also set to receive 13 Class 377/1s (377121-133) from Southern to replace ageing Class 465 units, with 377121 and 377122 in passenger service since 2nd January 2025.

==Aborted proposals==
===Great Northern===
In 2016, 19 of the 23 Class 377/5 units were planned to be transferred to Great Northern, for use on non-stop London-Cambridge services. However, the 29 former Thameslink Class 387/1s were transferred, instead. The Class 377/5s were later transferred to Southeastern, as part of their requirement for additional capacity.

==Fleet details==


==Accidents and incidents==

On 28 November 2016, a fire broke out in the MOSL car of a Southern Class 377 (unit 377442) at Eastbourne station, causing damage to the ceiling and interior. The cause was later identified to be faulty wiring within a hand dryer located in the toilet.

On 17 February 2018, a 377 (unit 377454) hit a car on a level crossing at Barns Green near . The two occupants of the car died at the scene.

On 8 May 2019, 377142 collided with the buffer stop at London Victoria station.

On 23 August 2020, 377317 was derailed at the exit of the Tonbridge Jubilee Sidings.

<doc id="1112994" wikidata="Q5013096" url="?curid=1112994" title="CNC wood router">
<text>A CNC wood router is a CNC router tool that creates objects from wood. CNC stands for &quot;computer numerical control&quot;. The CNC works on the Cartesian coordinate system (X, Y, Z) for 3D motion control. Parts of a project can be designed in the computer with a CAD/CAM program, and then cut automatically using a router or other cutters to produce a finished part.
The CNC router is ideal for hobbies, engineering prototyping, product development, art, and production work.

== Operation ==
A CNC wood router uses CNC (computer numerical control) and is similar to a metal CNC mill with the following differences:

*The wood router typically spins faster — with a range of 13,000 to 24,000 RPM
*Professional quality machines frequently use surface facing tools up to 3&quot; in diameter or more, and spindle power from 5 to 15 horsepower. Machines capable of routing heavy material at over a thousand inches per minute are common.
*Some machines use smaller toolholders MK2 (Morse taper #2 - on older machines), ISO-30, HSK-63 or the tools just get held in a collet tool holder affixed directly to the spindle nose. ISO-30 and HSK-63 are rapid-change toolholding systems. HSK-63 has begun to supplant the ISO-30 as the rapid change standard in recent years.

A wood router is controlled in the same way as a metal mill, but there are CAM and CAD applications such as Artcam, Mastercam, Bobcad, and AlphaCam, which are specifically designed for use with wood routers.

Wood routers are frequently used to machine other soft materials such as plastics.

Typical three-axis CNC wood routers are generally much bigger than their metal shop counterparts. 5&#x27; x 5&#x27;, 4&#x27; x 8&#x27;, and 5&#x27; x 10&#x27; are typical bed sizes for wood routers. They can be built to accommodate very large sizes up to, but not limited to 12&#x27; x 100&#x27;. The table can move, allowing for true three axis (xyz) motion, or the gantry can move, which requires the third axis to be controlled by two slaved servo motors.

== Advantages ==
The advantages of CNC wood router (compared to general machine) as follows,

* High degree of automation
* Consistent quality
* High productivity
* Processing complex shape 
* Easy to implement CAD/CAM
* 2D, 2.5D and 3D capable

== Components ==

=== Separate heads ===
Some wood routers have multiple separate heads that can come down simultaneously or not. Some routers have multiple heads that can run complete separate programs on separate tables all while being controlled by the same interface.

=== Dust collection / vacuum collector===

The wood router typically has 6&quot;-10&quot; air ducts to suck up the wood chips and dust created. They can be piped to a stand-alone or full shop dust collection system.

Some wood routers are specialized for cabinetry and have many drills that can be programmed to come down separately or together. The drills are generally spaced 32 mm apart on centres - a spacing system called 32 mm System. This is for the proper spacing of shelving for cabinets. Drilling can be vertical or horizontal (in the Y or X axis from either side/end of the workpiece) which allows a panel to be drilled on all four edges as well as the top surface. Many of these machines with large drilling arrays are derived from CNC point-to-point borers.

== Securing the workpiece ==

=== Suction systems ===
The wood router typically holds wood with suction through the table or pods that raise the work above the table. Pods may be used for components which require edge profiling (or undercutting), are manufactured from solid wood or where greater flexibility in production is required. This type of bed requires less extraction with greater absolute vacuum.

A second type hold down uses a spoil board. This allows vacuum suction through a low density table and allows the placement of parts anywhere on the table. These types of tables are typically used for nest-based manufacturing (NBM) where multiple components are routed from a single sheet. This type of manufacturing precludes edge drilling or undercut edge work on components.

Vacuum pumps are required with both types of tables where volume and &quot;strength&quot; are determined based on the types of materials being cut.

== Maintenance ==
Proper operation and maintenance in right way can greatly extend machine&#x27;s life and reduce the incidence of failures.

* Avoid the direct sunlight, excessive dust and humidity
* Keep away from the equipment with high vibration
*Keep dust and similar away from wheels and bearings, use compressed air

<doc id="1112996" wikidata="Q1346267" url="?curid=1112996" title="Serginho (footballer, born 1974)">
<text>Paulo Sérgio Oliveira da Silva (19 October 1974 – 27 October 2004), better known as Serginho, was a Brazilian footballer who played as a defender.

Serginho started his career in the town of Coronel Fabriciano, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. He played for São Caetano as a defender, and was playing for his team in a &quot;Campeonato Brasileiro&quot; match against São Paulo on 27 October 2004 when he suffered a fatal cardiac arrest 60 minutes into the match. A later autopsy showed Serginho&#x27;s heart to weigh 600 grams, twice the size of an average human heart.. After a investigation, his team received a 24-points deduction but was not relegated, despite the loss of points. This was because São Caetano&#x27;s staff let him play even knowing that he had heart problems, detected in the pre-season medical tests.

With São Caetano, Serginho won the 2nd division of Campeonato Paulista in 2000, and the first division in 2004, and was runner-up in two Campeonatos Brasileiros and one Copa Libertadores.

<text>Waverly Fairgrounds (often styled as Waverly &quot;Fair Grounds&quot;) or Waverly Park was the home of the Elizabeth Resolutes baseball club. The Resolutes participated in the National Association 1873 season, so Waverly is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league.

The park was located in a community called Waverly, which was bordered by Lower Road (now Dayton Avenue), Haynes Avenue, and Frelinghuysen Street. The site is now split by Weequahic Park in Newark and B&#x27;nai Jeshuron Cemetery in Elizabeth.

The New Jersey State Fair was held here from 1867 through 1898. The land was sold to Essex County for development into what is now Weequahic Park.

The Resolutes began in about 1869 as an independent club, staging games at Waverly against New York area clubs including members of the NA. The Resolutes joined the NA in 1873 and played seven games at Waverly, from April 28 through July 23. All of them were losses, during their forlorn 2–21 season overall. Soon after, the Resolutes ceased operations.

The exact location of the diamond is uncertain. Based on other usages of fair grounds as ballparks, it is reasonable to suppose that it was within the race track. The race track continued to be used for the better part of the 20th century. Its remnant is an oval-shaped roadway.

<text>The Wired CD is an album that was released in 2004 as a collaborative effort between &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, Creative Commons, and sixteen musicians and groups. &quot;The Wired CD&quot; was distributed inside the front cover of the November 2004 issue of &quot;Wired&quot;, which also featured a variety of interviews and bios of the performers. Unusually, the songs were released under one of two Creative Commons Licenses, permitting sampling and file-sharing of the songs.

The &quot;WIRED CD&quot; was the first major compilation of music free to sample and share under Creative Commons&#x27; &quot;some rights reserved&quot; copyright. The groundbreaking album features tracks from the Beastie Boys, David Byrne, Zap Mama, My Morning Jacket, Spoon, Gilberto Gil, Dan the Automator, Thievery Corporation, Le Tigre, Paul Westerberg, Fine Arts Militia featuring Chuck D, The Rapture, Cornelius, Danger Mouse &amp; Jemini, DJ Dolores, and Matmos.

In 2005, Creative Commons and Wired Magazine launched The Fine Art of Sampling Contest in which contestants sampled the tracks from The Wired CD to create their own composition. The top winning entries were subsequently compiled onto a CD entitled The Wired CD: Ripped. Sampled. Mashed. Shared.

<doc id="1113017" wikidata="Q682596" url="?curid=1113017" title="Kyffhäuser">
<text>The Kyffhäuser (, sometimes also referred to as &quot;Kyffhäusergebirge&quot;) is a hill range in Central Germany, shared by Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt, southeast of the Harz mountains. It reaches its highest point at the Kulpenberg with an elevation of . The range is the site of medieval Kyffhausen Castle (&quot;Reichsburg Kyffhausen&quot;) and the 19th century Kyffhäuser Monument; it has significance in German traditional mythology as the legendary resting place of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name has not been conclusively established. &quot;Kyffhäuser&quot; (formerly also &quot;Kiffhäuser&quot;) probably stems from the Low German word &quot;cuf&quot; &#x27;head&#x27; or &#x27;peak&#x27;, and &quot;huse&quot; &#x27;house&#x27;. Other explanations refer to &quot;kiff&quot; &#x27;quarrel&#x27; and the historic castles at the site.

==Geography==

The Kyffhäuser is a small &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot; located in the Kyffhäuserkreis district of Thuringia and the Mansfeld-Südharz district of Saxony-Anhalt, not far from the larger Harz range to the northwest. The range has a length of , from west to east, and a width of . The highest point at the Kulpenberg, with the Kulpenburg TV tower, is located near the village of Steinthaleben in Thuringia. The range borders on the Hainleite hill chain and the fertile Goldene Aue basin in the south. Large portions are protected as a nature park.

Some parts of the range on the western and southern slopes are karstified and bare of trees, covered by calcareous grassland. The area shaped by numerous sandstone quarries today is the site of a geopark, comprising the Kyffhäuser Monument, the Barbarossa Cave near Rottleben, the &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; at Tilleda, and the Bilzingsleben Paleolithic site. The Schlachtberg hill on the southeastern rim near Bad Frankenhausen was the site of the decisive Battle of Frankenhausen during the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525, commemorated in the monumental painting &quot;Early Bourgeois Revolution in Germany&quot; by Werner Tübke.

==History==
The settlement of Tilleda, located below the northern rim of the range, was already mentioned as &quot;Dullide&quot; in the early 9th century in the &quot;Breviarium Sancti Lulli&quot; register of Hersfeld Abbey. A &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; at the site is attested by the 972 Marriage Charter of Empress Theophanu. Numerous stays of her husband Otto II, as well as by his successors Otto III, Conrad II, and Henry III are documented by deeds they issued here.

During the 11th century, Tilleda was superseded by a castle on the hill above the settlement that may have been erected by Emperor Henry IV during the Saxon Rebellion. His son Henry V inherited the quarrels and the castle was finally slighted by the Saxon Duke (and later Emperor) Lothair of Supplinburg in 1119. Lothair himself started the reconstruction in his later years and the Imperial Castle of Kyffhausen, one of the largest castle complexes in Germany, was completed under the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Tilleda was last mentioned as an Imperial castle in 1194, when Frederick&#x27;s son Henry VI reconciled here with the insurgent Welf duke Henry the Lion.

In 1698 Count Albert Anton of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt had a Baroque hunting lodge erected at the hamlet of Rathsfeld in the centre of the Kyffhäuser range. Last used as a residence by Prince Günther Victor of Schwarzburg after his abdication in 1918, it was turned into a recreation home of the &quot;Kyffhäuserbund&quot; veterans&#x27; association in 1925. After World War II the remote site became a Young Pioneer camp and a training camp of the East German &quot;Gesellschaft für Sport und Technik&quot;; since German reunification, the empty premises have decayed.

==Kyffhäuser legend==
According to a king asleep in mountain legend, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who actually drowned on 10 June 1190 in the Calycadnus River near Seleukeia in Asia Minor during the Third Crusade, is not in fact dead, but sleeps in a hidden chamber underneath the Kyffhäuser hills. He sits motionless at a stone table and his beard has supposedly grown so long over the centuries that it grew through the table. As in the similar legend of King Arthur, Barbarossa supposedly awaits Germany&#x27;s hour of greatest need, when he will emerge once again from under the hill. The presence of ravens circling the Kyffhäuser summit is said to be a sign of Barbarossa&#x27;s continuing presence. Similar rapture legends refer to Emperor Frederick II or to Charlemagne sleeping in the Untersberg near Salzburg.

The Barbarossa myth was first documented in the late 17th century and later popularized by the Brothers Grimm and a poem written in 1817 by Friedrich Rückert. Frequently taken up by Romantic authors, and satirized in &quot;Germany. A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; by Heinrich Heine, it became the expression of the desire for the Old Empire&#x27;s re-emergence as a German nation state. When the Kyffhäuser Monument was built at the ruins of the Imperial Castle in 1890–1896, with a statue of Frederick Barbarossa and an Emperor William monument, the German Emperor William I was thought to have &quot;laid to rest&quot; Barbarossa by the 1871 unification of Germany.

==Today==
Today, the hills are a popular tourist site, featuring the restored medieval &quot;Reichsburg Kyffhausen&quot; complex, including a small museum and the castle well, at depth said to be &quot;the deepest castle well in the world&quot;. The downhill &quot;Pfalz&quot; of Tilleda is an archaeological open-air museum and a stop on the scenic Romanesque Road.

The range is also the site of an annual touring car hillclimbing and of the &quot;Kyffhäuser-Berglauf&quot; cross country running competition. The range is a popular destination for hikers; the Kaiser Way leads across the Kyffhäuser northwards to the Harz mountains.

<text>Paraconsistent mathematics, sometimes called inconsistent mathematics, represents an attempt to develop the classical infrastructure of mathematics (e.g. analysis) based on a foundation of paraconsistent logic instead of classical logic. A number of reformulations of analysis can be developed, for example functions which both do and do not have a given value simultaneously.

Chris Mortensen claims (see references):
:One could hardly ignore the examples of analysis and its special case, the calculus. There prove to be many places where there are distinctive inconsistent insights; see Mortensen (1995) for example. (1) Robinson&#x27;s non-standard analysis was based on infinitesimals, quantities smaller than any real number, as well as their reciprocals, the infinite numbers. This has an inconsistent version, which has some advantages for calculation in being able to discard higher-order infinitesimals. The theory of differentiation turned out to have these advantages, while the theory of integration did not. (2)

<doc id="1113034" wikidata="Q1668127" url="?curid=1113034" title="Interpolation (popular music)">
<text>In popular music, interpolation (also called a replayed sample) refers to using a melodyor portions of a melody (often with modified lyrics)from a previously recorded song but re-recording the melody instead of directly sampling it. Interpolation is often cited as a legal defence to mask unlicenced sampling when the artist or label who owns the recording of the music declines to license the sample, or if licensing the piece of music is considered too costly.

==Interpolation examples==
Interpolation is prevalent in many genres of popular music; early examples are the Beatles interpolating &quot;La Marseillaise&quot; and &quot;She Loves You&quot;, among three other interpolations in the 1967 song &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, and Lyn Collins interpolating lyrics from the 5 Royales&#x27; &quot;Think&quot; in her similarly titled 1972 song &quot;Think (About It)&quot;.

One genre where interpolating (as well as sampling) is highly prevalent is hip hop music; prominent examples include Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;Pastime Paradise&quot; interpolated in Coolio&#x27;s hit song &quot;Gangsta&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, and Sting&#x27;s &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot; interpolated in Juice WRLD&#x27;s 2018 hit &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot;.

In pop music, notable examples include Anne-Marie&#x27;s &quot;2002&quot; which interpolates lyrics from six songs, Portugal. The Man&#x27;s &quot;Feel It Still&quot; which interpolates the Marvelettes&#x27; 1961 hit &quot;Please Mr. Postman&quot;, &quot;Bad Liar&quot; by Selena Gomez which interpolates the bassline of &quot;Psycho Killer&quot; by new wave band Talking Heads, and Ariana Grande&#x27;s 2019 hit &quot;7 Rings&quot; which interpolates &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; written by Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein and made famous by Julie Andrews.

The 1992 song &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; by reggae duo Chaka Demus &amp; Pliers has been interpolated in Omarion and Chris Brown&#x27;s &quot;Post to Be&quot;, in Pitbull&#x27;s &quot;El Taxi&quot;, in Jason Derulo&#x27;s &quot;Too Hot&quot; and in the remix version of Black Eyed Peas&#x27; &quot;Ritmo&quot; featuring Jaden Smith, among many other songs.

In 2023, Spanish pop singer Abraham Mateo interpolated the 1983 song &quot;Maniac&quot; by Michael Sembello in the song &quot;Maníaca&quot;. It achieved a platinum record certification in Spain, the same as the original version which also went platinum there.

<doc id="1113056" wikidata="Q121976" url="?curid=1113056" title="Federico Bahamontes">
<text>Federico Martín Bahamontes, born Alejandro Martín Bahamontes (; 9 July 1928 – 8 August 2023), was a Spanish professional road racing cyclist. He won the 1959 Tour de France and a total of 11 Grand Tour stages between 1954 and 1965. He won a total of nine mountain classifications and was the first cyclist to complete a &quot;career triple&quot; by winning the mountain classification in all three Grand Tours. Following his retirement, Bahamontes ran a bicycle and motorcycle shop and was named the best climber in the history of the Tour de France by a panel organised by &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; in 2013.

==Early life==
Federico Bahamontes was born on 9 July 1928 in Santo Domingo-Caudilla, Toledo, to Julián Martín and Victoria Bahamontes. Unlike the usual custom of calling a Spaniard by the first of two surnames, Bahamontes is known by his second; there were too many with the surname Martín in his village so he took up his mother&#x27;s surname. He was named after his uncle, Federico, who was the head of the family and proclaimed that Bahamontes would be called after him at the baptism in the local church. Between 1929 and 1931, his parents had three more children, all girls. Bahamontes attended a school in Toledo run by nuns, which he did not enjoy. In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out, but Bahamontes&#x27; father, a veteran of the Cuban War of Independence, did not fight because he was too old. Along with other civilians in Toledo, however, he was enlisted by Nationalist forces to act as reinforcements as Republican forces closed in on Toledo. He managed to escape this service, but when he returned home, he found soldiers who &quot;called themselves Communists&quot; and ordered him to open the storehouses on the estate where the family lived. He refused, before running away, and eventually escaping the ensuing manhunt by hiding in a doorway.

The family eventually fled to Madrid in July 1936. When the family arrived, the city was held by Republican forces who had withstood an attempted invasion from the Nationalists. In October, however, Nationalist forces decided to lay siege to the city and Julián was enlisted into the Republican reserve forces and led a mule team that transported supplies. Meanwhile, Bahamontes, along with his mother and sisters, escaped to the village of Villarrubia de Santiago due to the intensifying air raids in Madrid. They were joined by Julián after the war, but the family continued to struggle; as he had been with the Republicans, the losing side, Bahamontes&#x27; father received no pension and he was forced to break rocks for road construction in order to earn enough money for the family. The young Bahamontes resorted to theft in order to sustain himself and the family; he would jump into the trailers of lorries from a bridge over a road before filling a bag with food from the trailer. He also dug out live ammunition from civil war trenches to sell as scrap metal.

In 1946, at the age of 18, Bahamontes bought his first bike for 150 pesetas (roughly equivalent to £250 or US$ in 2014) in order to transport food illegally between villages. As rationing was in place due to economic ruin, the black market for food flourished. It was during this activity that Bahamontes contracted an unknown disease which he believed to be typhoid. Whilst hiding from the Civil Guard, who had orders to arrest anyone black marketeering, he stood in stagnant water and was bitten by a mosquito (even though typhoid is not spread via mosquitoes). This led to extreme weight loss, loss of hair and fever. After being restricted to his house for two months, Bahamontes returned to black marketeering, and competed in his first cycling race after two other black marketeers invited him. On 18 July 1947, he cycled to a nearby village where the race began and, with only a banana and lemon as sustenance, he managed to finish second.

==Career==
Following victory at his second race, Bahamontes began racing as a full-time amateur; the prize money from such races was significantly more than the wages of what little work there was. He soon formed a friendship and partnership with another cyclist, Ladislau Soria, who was strong on the flat. Together, they dominated the local races with Soria&#x27;s brother acting as a manager. In his early years as an amateur, Bahamontes won the Tour of Andalusia and Tour of Cadiz; however, he was called up to 18 months of National service in July 1949. It was during this time that he opened up a shop in Toledo renting out bikes.

Bahamontes first faced professionals at the 1953 Vuelta a Asturias. The field included some of the strongest cyclists in Spain and teams from Italy and Belgium. Racing as an independent semi-professional, he won the opening stage and eventually finished twenty-first out of sixty-nine. He competed in more races in Madrid and elsewhere in Spain before moving to Barcelona, the wealthiest city in Spain. It was here that he received backing from Santiago Mostajo Trigo, a former cyclist and businessman who was a &quot;hugely influential figure&quot; in Spanish cycling.

Due to financial reasons, the Vuelta a España did not run between 1951 and 1954, so the Volta a Catalunya was the biggest race in Spain. It was there, in 1953, that Bahamontes won the King of the Mountains. The race received coverage in &quot;Mundo Deportivo&quot;, a Catalan sports newspaper, as well as having the support of fourteen sponsors. Teams from across Europe competed, with Bahamontes racing for a team directed by Mostajo and sponsored by Balanzas Berkel, a manufacturer of weighing equipment. He performed above expectations, managing a solo breakaway on stage 8 to secure his mountain classification jersey.
The director of the Spanish team, Julián Berrendero, picked Bahamontes for the 1954 Tour de France in the summer of 1953, with instructions to &quot;try to win it&quot;. He initially declined, stating that he did not know French and &quot;had no suitcase&quot;, but later accepted the offer with a few weeks to go after discussing with his parents. The Spanish team included 1948 Vuelta a España winner Bernardo Ruiz, former national champion Francisco Masip, and 1953 Volta a Catalunya winner Salvador Botella. The first half of the race was relaxed for Bahamontes, until stage eleven where he broke away from the peloton and went over the Col d&#x27;Aubisque in first place. It was on the fog-covered descent, however, that he crashed, eventually finishing thirty-second. Bahamontes continued to score well in the mountain classifications; he was first over the Col du Tourmalet and Col de Peyresourde. It was the Col du Galibier, however, that was the most important; Bahamontes rode down Jean Dotto to finish the climb in first place, thus winning a 100,000 franc (roughly $250 in 2021) prize as well as mountain points which secured him the mountain classification victory. He finished 25th in the General classification.

The next year, Bahamontes competed at the 1955 Vuelta a España. He gained the nickname &quot;el Gitano&quot; (the gypsy) when he started to sell bike parts to other riders he had bought from factories in France. The race did not go well for Bahamontes; during stage five, he got a &quot;twisted tendon&quot; in his left knee and had a limp when off the bike. The injury was so serious that a protrusion could be felt on his knee several decades later. As a result, Bahamontes would not achieve another Tour de France mountain classification victory until 1958. After receiving treatment for his injury which reduced the pain and inflammation, Bahamontes continued to race. He won the 1955 Vuelta a Asturias, Vuelta a los Puertos and a hill climb on Mont Faron. Despite the success, a medical examination before the Tour de France prevented him from competing and he was replaced by national champion Antonio Gelabert.

He won the Tour de France in 1959, and won the Tour&#x27;s Mountains classification (also called the &quot;King of the Mountains&quot;) six times (1954, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1963, 1964). He also took second and third places overall in 1963 and 1964 respectively. In total, he won seven Tour stages. He was also second in the 1957 Vuelta a España, and won the mountains competition then and the following year, 1958, when he finished 6th. He also won the mountains competition in the Giro d&#x27;Italia in 1956.

In the 1959 Tour de France, Bahamontes benefited from an early escape on a stage in the Pyrenees, and then won a mountain time trial to the Puy-de-Dôme. Into the Alps, he combined with fellow climber Charly Gaul to extend the lead into Grenoble, and although French riders Henry Anglade and Jacques Anquetil cut their deficits, neither made up enough time to threaten Bahamontes&#x27; overall lead. He won by just over four minutes from Anglade, and became King of the Mountains too.

In 1960, Bahamontes got no further than the first few days of the Tour, after falling ill. In the 1963 Tour de France, Anquetil beat Bahamontes into second place. Bahamontes and Anquetil performed well in the Alps and after stage 16 were only three seconds apart in first and second place respectively. Anquetil was able to stay with Bahamontes, the superior climber, over the steep climb of the Col de la Forclaz on the following stage, won by Bahamontes. This allowed Anquetil to use his advantage in the time trial to overcome his deficit and claim a fourth Tour victory, while Bahamontes finished second. A year later, in the 1964 Tour de France, Anquetil took his fifth victory and the margin over Bahamontes in third was 4:44; Raymond Poulidor took second place. Bahamontes had his sixth King of the Mountains win and two more stage wins (bringing his total Tour de France stage wins to seven). His final Tour de France came in 1965, where he abandoned on stage 10, having finished the previous day&#x27;s stage second to last, 40 minutes down. On his final stage, he made one last attack on the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet, in his own words &quot;to show them [the audience] what they would be missing&quot;.

==Retirement==

Following his retirement, Bahamontes opened a bicycle and motorcycle shop in Toledo and offered to lead visitors through a museum dedicated to his career.

In 2013, during his 85th birthday that coincided with the 100th edition of Le Tour de France, he was named the best climber in the history of the race, ahead of French rider Richard Virenque, by a jury selected by &quot;L&#x27; Équipe&quot; newspaper. Members of the jury included active riders, such as the popular French rider Thomas Voeckler, and others such as five-time winner of the race Bernard Hinault, as well as the general director of Le Tour de France Christian Prudhomme. The award was given by the French President François Hollande. Also, he has been honoured with the &quot;Premio Nacional Francisco Fernández Ochoa&quot;.

Following the death of Roger Walkowiak in 2017, Bahamontes became the oldest living Tour de France winner. Following Bahamontes&#x27; death, 1968 Tour winner Jan Janssen took over this position.

Bahamontes died on 8 August 2023. He was 95 years old. His home town of Toledo declared two days of mourning following his death.

<text>The GNU Scientific Library (or GSL) is a software library for numerical computations in applied mathematics and science. The GSL is written in C; wrappers are available for other programming languages. The GSL is part of the GNU Project and is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

== Project history ==
The GSL project was initiated in 1996 by physicists Mark Galassi and James Theiler of Los Alamos National Laboratory. They aimed at writing a modern replacement for widely used but somewhat outdated Fortran libraries such as Netlib. They carried out the overall design and wrote early modules; with that ready they recruited other scientists to contribute.

The &quot;overall development of the library and the design and implementation of the major modules&quot; was carried out by Brian Gough and Gerard Jungman. Other major contributors were Jim Davies, Reid Priedhorsky, M. Booth, and F. Rossi.

Version 1.0 was released in 2001. In the following years, the library expanded only slowly; as the documentation stated, the maintainers were more interested in stability than in additional functionality. Major version 1 ended with release 1.16 of July 2013; this was the only public activity in the three years 2012–2014.

Vigorous development resumed with publication of version 2.0 in October 2015, which included user contributed patches. The latest version 2.8 was released in May 2024.

== Example ==
The following example program calculates the value of the Bessel function of the first kind and order zero for 5:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h&gt;

int main(void)
 double x = 5.0;
 double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0(x);
 printf(&quot;J0(%g) = %.18e\n&quot;, x, y);
 return 0;

The example program has to be linked to the GSL library
upon compilation:

$ gcc $(gsl-config --cflags) example.c $(gsl-config --libs)
The output is shown below and should be correct to double-precision accuracy:

J0(5) = -1.775967713143382920e-01
== Features ==
The software library provides facilities for:
=== Programming-language bindings ===
Since the GSL is written in C, it is straightforward to provide wrappers for other programming languages. Such wrappers currently exist for
* AMPL
* C++
* Fortran
* Haskell
* Java
* Julia
* Common Lisp
* OCaml
* Octave
* Perl Data Language
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust

=== C++ support ===
The GSL can be used in C++ classes, but not using pointers to member functions, because the type of &quot;pointer to member function&quot; is different from &quot;pointer to function&quot;. Instead, pointers to static functions have to be used. Another common workaround is using a functor.

C++ wrappers for GSL are available. Not all of these are regularly maintained. They do offer access to matrix and vector classes without having to use GSL&#x27;s interface to malloc and free functions. Some also offer support for also creating workspaces that behave like Smart pointer classes. Finally, there is (limited, as of April 2020) support for allowing the user to create classes to represent a parameterised function as a functor.

While not strictly wrappers, there are some C++ classes that allow C++ users to use the Gnu Scientific Library with wrapper features.

<doc id="1113068" wikidata="Q2688496" url="?curid=1113068" title="British Rail Class 365">
<text>The British Rail Class 365 &quot;Networker Express&quot; dual-voltage ( and 750 V DC) electric multiple unit passenger trains were built by ABB at Holgate Road Carriage Works in 1994 and 1995.

The Class 365 was derived from the EMU after the planned &quot;Universal Networker&quot; Classes 371 and 381 were not funded through to production. An initial prototype that better suited the operation of long-distance services was developed from an existing unit (designated as Class 465/3), as the new type was intended to operate services in South East England and on the Great Northern Route. The purchase of 41 Class 365s was authorised in late 1993; they would be the last trains to be built at the Holgate Road works prior to its closure. Due to the front end of refurbished units resembling a smiling face, the trains have been nicknamed &quot;Happy Trains&quot; by enthusiasts.

Deliveries began in 1994 under Network SouthEast and continued after operations transferred to the private sector; the final unit was delivered to West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) in July 1998. Connex South Eastern received 16 units while West Anglia Great Northern received 25. During 2004, South Eastern Trains opted to transfer all of its sets to WAGN.

The Class 365 has been involved in several accidents, which has included fatalities; the most serious accident to date occurred at Potters Bar in 2002. In September 2014, all units were transferred with the Thameslink, Southern &amp; Great Northern franchise to Govia Thameslink Railway. In June 2018, ten sets were transferred to Abellio ScotRail to operate services from Edinburgh to Glasgow and Stirling. On 15 May 2021, Great Northern withdrew the last of its Class 365 sets. During July 2021, all of the Class 365s were acquired by Eversholt Rail Group; all but 3 vehicles have been scrapped. Newer types of rolling stock, such as the Class 385s and Class 387s, have typically been introduced to replace the type with various operators.

==Background==
In the early 1990s, the Networker family was entering large-scale service in the Network SouthEast sector – both third-rail &#x27;Networker&#x27; EMUs (/) and &#x27;Network Turbo&#x27; DMUs (/) were in service, with proposals for others, including a so-called &quot;Universal Networker&quot;, intended as Classes 371 and 381, that would have dual-voltage capability. However, by 1992, no work had been done in the development of these due to a lack of funding, so a replacement plan was required. For this, the Class 465 was modified for longer-distance services – a prototype was converted from an existing unit (designated as Class 465/3) to determine suitability, before funding was authorised during late 1993 for the purchase of 41 dual-voltage EMUs, each of four cars. These became the Class 365. Network SouthEast had successfully advocated in favour of the Class 365 project to secure investment from the British government; however, this came at the expense of competing proposals, including InterCity&#x27;s envisioned InterCity 250 series of high speed trains.

==Description==
Although specified as a dual-voltage unit, Class 365s never operated with this capability since they were built with only one system of traction current pickup.

The first 16 units (365501 to 365516), which worked briefly for Network SouthEast before the South Eastern franchise was awarded to Connex South Eastern, were originally supplied only with DC shoe gear for use on the 750VDC third-rail system. In this configuration the maximum speed was . During testing and commissioning, 365502 ran briefly on the AC network, this being the main reason for the unit being chosen to be subleased to West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) in the aftermath of the Potters Bar accident in 2002.

When they transferred to WAGN for use with overhead line traction supply, the shoes and associated equipment were removed and a Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph was installed, along with other operator and voltage-specific modifications and testing by Bombardier Transportation at its Doncaster Works. However, the Class 365s retained the original 750VDC electrical bus, meaning that when on overhead lines the current was collected as AC, rectified to DC for the onboard systems, and then inverted back to AC for the three-phase traction motors. For running on overhead lines the maximum speed was raised to .

Basic equipment consisted of:
* DMOC A – 4x Three-phase AC traction motors, traction inverter, sander
* TOSL – Compressor, auxiliary converter, universal access toilet
* PTOSL – Pantograph, transformer, auxiliary converter, small toilet
* DMOC B – 4x Three-phase AC traction motors, traction inverter, sander

Dynamic (rheostatic) braking on the two Driving Motor coaches was available in addition to disc brakes, via a system of brake blending.

In common with the whole Networker fleet, wheel slide protection (WSP) operated on every axle. Under braking conditions a blowdown valve released air from the brake cylinder of any axle if the rotational speed varies significantly from the average axle speed on the train.

Internal LED Passenger Information Display Systems and Auto-Announcers were fitted across the fleet.

==Ownership==
In the lead up to the privatisation of British Rail, responsibility for the Class 365s passed to Eversholt Rail Group. However, because the British Railways Board had leased rather than purchased the Class 365s, under a clause in the original procurement contract, ownership of the remaining 40 sets passed to the Department for Transport subsidiary Train Fleet (2019) Limited in July 2019 after it was obliged to pay out the leases to the Royal Bank of Scotland in the event that the trains were not wanted. In July 2021, all were sold back to Eversholt after termination of their leases with Govia Thameslink Railway was agreed.

==Operations==
===South Eastern===

The first 16 units were fitted for use on the 750VDC lines. The first Class 365 set was delivered in November 1994 while testing commenced on 15 June 1995. Their first use in service occurred on 13 October 1996, but due to problems in obtaining a safety case, they did not enter full service with Connex South Eastern until 16 June 1997. Before it entered service, 365513 was damaged in a shunting incident at Chart Leacon TMD and was forwarded to Doncaster Works in November 1996.

From August 2002 until January 2003, 365502 was sublet to WAGN to provide cover after 365526 was involved in the Potters Bar accident. All passed with the franchise to South Eastern Trains in November 2003. All were transferred to West Anglia Great Northern during 2004.

===Great Northern===
Twenty-five Class 365s (365517 to 365541) were delivered to Hornsey TMD to operate services on the East Coast Main Line from London King&#x27;s Cross to Peterborough and King&#x27;s Lynn. The first entered service with Network SouthEast on 9 December 1996. All sets were included in the transfer of the franchise to West Anglia Great Northern in January 1997. The last was delivered in July 1998.

As part of a project to fit driver&#x27;s cab air conditioning, all units received new fronts between 2001 and 2002. In May 2002, 365526 was involved in the Potters Bar accident and was subsequently written off. From August 2002 until January 2003, 365502 was sublet from Connex South Eastern to provide cover. In 2004, all 16 of Connex South Eastern examples (365501 to 365516) were transferred to West Anglia Great Northern to release Class 317s for use by Thameslink.

The remaining 40 sets passed with the franchise to First Capital Connect during April 2006. A refurbishment program at Ilford EMU Depot commenced in January 2014. All units passed with the Thameslink, Southern &amp; Great Northern franchise to Govia Thameslink Railway in September 2014.

In 2017, the Class 365 fleet were relegated to peak-hour services after the newer Class 387s and 700s entered service. It was proposed that some would be transferred to Great Western Railway to operate services on the Great Western Main Line from London Paddington to Newbury and Oxford, but this scheme was aborted when new Class 387s were purchased instead. Great Northern retained 21 sets to operate limited stop peak-time services between London King&#x27;s Cross-Peterborough and London King&#x27;s Cross-. The remaining sets were placed in store in Ely.

During June 2018, ten sets were transferred to Abellio ScotRail to operate services from Edinburgh to Glasgow and Stirling. The other nine moved from Ely to King&#x27;s Heath TMD, Northampton for further storage before moving to Crewe in September 2018.

In March 2021, it was announced that Great Northern would be withdrawing the remaining Class 365s from service in May 2021, in favour of Class 387s transferred from Gatwick Express. The last day of service for the Class 365s on Great Northern was on 15 May 2021. 

===ScotRail===

In April 2018, ten Class 365s (509, 513, 517, 519, 521, 523, 525, 529, 533 and 537) were leased to Abellio ScotRail in response to a rolling stock shortage which was caused by the delayed entry to service of the new Class 385 EMUs and the imminent transfer of a number of DMUs to Arriva Rail North. They entered service on 23 June 2018 on Glasgow to Edinburgh and Stirling services after modifications and driver training.

In comparison with the three- and six-car DMUs previously used on the same routes by ScotRail, the eight-car Class 365 EMU sets provided an additional 17,200 seats per day, as well as having better acceleration and being cleaner. ScotRail only used the type briefly, and all units were withdrawn during March 2019 after issues with the Class 385 were resolved. These units were relocated to Crewe where they were kept in warm store by Rail Operations Group.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 365526 – DMOC B and PTOSL were damaged in the Potters Bar rail accident in 2002. After being stored at Crewe Works and later Wolverton Works until the Rail Accident Investigation Branch had completed its investigations, two carriages were used for target practice at RAF Spadeadam, while one was taken to Ilford EMU Depot for stripping of spare parts.
* 365531 – DMOC A was damaged in a fatal collision with a tractor at Black Horse Drove crossing in October 2005.
* 365532 – DMOC A was damaged in a collision with a tractor at Hatson&#x27;s User-Worked Crossing in September 2011.
* 365512 – DMOC B was damaged in a fatal collision with a car at Pleasants crossing in July 2012.
* A Class 365 unit collided at low speed with another it was due to couple onto at Cambridge station on 30 May 2015. Three passengers sustained slight injuries.
* 365520 – DMOC B was damaged in a collision with a Land Rover at Nairns User-Worked Crossing in August 2016.

==Fleet details==


===Naming===
Some were named. 365505 and 365515 were named by Connex South Eastern, and were subsequently removed. Vinyl nameplates with a pink backing were applied to the driving vehicles, behind the cab doors, by First Capital Connect. Following a repaint into Great Northern colours most were removed, but several were reapplied in the same style but with a light blue backing.

<doc id="1113069" wikidata="Q7498833" url="?curid=1113069" title="Shirley Render">
<text>Shirley Render (born April 1, 1943) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 1999, and was briefly a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon.

==Early life==
Born Shirley Hurst in Winnipeg, the daughter of Harold and Marg Hurst, she was educated at the University of Manitoba, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964 and a Master of Arts degree in 1984. She has worked as a social worker and High School teacher, and has lectured in Psychology at the University of Manitoba. She has also worked as a magazine editor.

She married Douglas E. Render.

==Aviation==
Render is a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force Association, and has authored two published books on aviation history: &quot;Double Cross: The Inside Story of James A. Richardson and Canadian Airways&quot; (1999) and &quot;No Place for a Lady: the Story of Canadian Women Pilots, 1928-1992&quot; (2000). She is a member of the &quot;International Association of Women&#x27;s Pilots&quot; and the &quot;Women and History Association&quot;, and has served as President of the Western Canada Aviation Museum (though her time as president coincided with a period of financial controversy at the museum).

==Politics==
Render was first elected to the Manitoba legislature as a Progressive Conservative in the 1990 provincial election in the south-central Winnipeg riding of St. Vital, defeating incumbent Liberal Bob Rose by 118 votes. She was re-elected by a greater margin in the 1995 provincial election, with the social-democratic New Democratic Party (NDP) displacing the Liberals for second place.

Render entered cabinet on February 5, 1999, the date of Premier Gary Filmon&#x27;s final cabinet shuffle. She was appointed Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for the Gaming Control Act. In the provincial election held later in the year, she lost her seat to NDP candidate Nancy Allan by over 1,500 votes.

Render tried to return to the legislature in Riel, which borders her former district, in the 2003 provincial election, but lost to NDP candidate Christine Melnick by over 1,000 votes.

==Current work==
Render is currently a member of the Community Partnership Executive at CBC Manitoba, and lectures at the Asper School of Business and Red River College. In 2001, she received a Governor General of Canada 125 award. She is currently the executive director of the Western Canada Aviation Museum.

In 2017, the city of Winnipeg opened Shirley Render Park, near St. Vital Park. The site was formerly a St. Vital landfill.

<text>Thomas W. Chittum is an American author, military analyst and former mercenary from New Jersey, now living in Washington state. He served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War. Chittum also fought in the Rhodesian War and the Croatian War of Independence as a mercenary.

== Biography ==
Chittum was born in New Jersey on February 28, 1947, to Mr. and Mrs. James R. Chittum. His father worked as a tool designer for Caterpillar Tractor Co. Chittum joined the army and trained as a paratrooper with the 173rd Army Brigade. He was originally stationed in Okinawa, but was sent to Vietnam where he served from 1965 until 1966. He was involved in numerous fire fights, including a battle in which his patrol killed a Viet Cong recruiter who had connections to China. Chittum was also involved in an operation in which he raided an abandoned Viet Cong base which contained propaganda leaflets connected to the Youth Against War and Fascism.

After his time in the army, Chittum briefly served in the Rhodesian Army in the early 1970s during the Bush War, where he spent several months on patrols along the border with Zambia.

From 1991 until 1992, Chittum fought with the Croatian Army in Croatia&#x27;s War of Independence. He first served in a recon unit made up of mostly Dutch mercenaries. He then served in a mortar unit made up of British and regular Croatian soldiers. His time in Croatia was mostly spent in trenches avoiding attacks from Serbian mortars, tanks, heavy machine guns and jets. Both sides relied on trench warfare and Chittum noted that one of the British mercenaries he served with once said &quot;It was a war fought with 1970s technology and 1914 tactics.&quot;

Chittum spent most of his adult life working as a computer programmer.

==Theories==
Chittum predicts that the United States will soon face Balkanization and a second Civil War based on racial conflicts. He plans to move to upstate New York because it would likely still be a Caucasian-controlled area after the American Southwest effectively becomes part of Mexico by 2020 due to immigration.

Chittum was a speaker at the First Annual Conference on Racial Separatism in 1998, which also featured Jared Taylor, Robert Brock, and Don Black. Those at the conference speculated about looming world and race wars. The now deceased Willis Carto suggested that the United States use funds that he said would otherwise go to Israel to re-settle African-Americans in Africa, and Brock stated that Carto&#x27;s plan would lead to Africa putting a man on the moon within three years. Brock also advanced the claim that both black and white nationalists needed to be racists in order to keep their identities intact.

<doc id="1113089" wikidata="Q971262" url="?curid=1113089" title="Stiletto">
<text>A stiletto (plural stilettos) is a specialized dagger with a long slender blade and needle-like point, primarily intended as a thrusting and stabbing weapon.

The stiletto blade&#x27;s narrow cross-section and tip (that is, a tip which tapers to a sharp point) reduce friction upon entry, allowing the blade to penetrate deeply. Some consider the stiletto a form of dagger, but most stilettos are specialized thrusting weapons not designed for cutting or slashing, even with edged examples. 

Over time, the term &quot;stiletto&quot; has been used as a general descriptive term for a variety of knife blades exhibiting a narrow blade with minimal cutting surfaces and a needle-like point, such as the U.S. V-42 stiletto. In American English usage, the name &quot;stiletto&quot; can also refer to a switchblade knife with a stiletto- or bayonet-type blade design. The term may also describe any exaggeratedly thin and pointed feature, such as a stiletto heel.

==Origins==
First developed in Italy, the stiletto dates from the late 15th century, and is thought to be a development of the rondel dagger or misericordia, a needle-pointed weapon with a narrow blade designed primarily for thrusting, though possessing cutting edges. Early stilettos normally used a one-piece cast-metal handle which was shaped and turned on a lathe. The stiletto blade was usually hammer-forged into a dense rod with a narrow, triangular cross-section, without any sharpened edges. However, other examples of the period have emerged bearing round, square, or diamond cross-sections.

The Italian word &quot;stiletto&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;stilus&quot;, the thin pointed Roman writing instrument used to engrave wax or clay tablets in ancient times. The stiletto began to gain fame during the late Middle Ages, when it was the secondary weapon of knights. Originally designed as a purely offensive weapon, the stiletto was used to finish off a fallen or severely wounded heavily armored opponent. The needle-like blade could, if used with sufficient force, penetrate most mail or find its way through gaps in a knight&#x27;s plate armor, and was narrow enough to pass through the eye slits of the helmeted knight. A severely wounded opponent who was not expected to survive would be given a &quot;mercy strike&quot; (French &quot;coup de grâce&quot;), hence the name &quot;miséricorde&quot;. Later, the Gunner&#x27;s Stiletto became a tool for clearing cannon-fuse touch holes and used in the same manner as an automotive oil dipstick, they were often inscribed with marks indicating levels of powder charges for ranging distance.

==Use as offensive weapon==
The stiletto was later adopted throughout Italy as the favored offensive thrusting knife (&quot;arma manesca&quot;) of the medieval assassin,&lt;ref name=&quot;Robertson&quot;/ so much so that it was invariably prohibited as a treacherous weapon (&quot;arma insidiosa&quot;) by the authorities of the day. The stiletto was preferred by assassins as it was silent, easily concealed inside a sleeve or jacket, and featured a blade capable of easily penetrating the heavy leather and fabric clothing of the day, while inflicting mortal wounds that tended to bleed less than those made by other types of knives. 

In Italy, the stiletto began to be employed along with the dagger as a fighting weapon; a 1536 dueling treatise authored by Achille Marozzo, &quot;Opera Nova&quot;, contains sections on dagger and stiletto fighting. By the time of the Renaissance, the term stiletto had come to describe a range of slender thrusting knives closely resembling the French poignard, many with conventional dagger-profile blades and sharpened edges, but always retaining the slim profile and needle-like point. To lighten the weapon, many stilettos were equipped with blades carrying fullers over a portion of their length.

The stiletto remained a popular weapon of criminals or political assassins from the 16th through the end of the 19th century, particularly in France, Corsica, and Italy. While still used as a weapon of surprise and assassination, the use of stiletto in preference to the dagger in close combat confrontations between adversaries became widespread throughout Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica. The continued popularity of the stiletto in the Kingdom of Sicily resulted in the development of the &quot;scherma di stiletto siciliano&quot; (Sicilian school of stiletto fighting). A person skilled in the use of a stiletto would thrust the knife deep into the victim, then twist the blade sharply in various directions before retracting it, causing the sharp point to inflict severe internal damage not readily apparent when examining the entrance wound.

The stiletto followed the first wave of Italian diaspora to the city of New Orleans, Louisiana during the mid-19th century, where the knife became a popular weapon of gamblers, gang members, and assorted assassins. The stiletto was involved in so many stabbings and murders in New Orleans that the city passed an ordinance in 1879 outlawing the sale or exhibition for sale of any stiletto within the city limits. Italian immigrants to America frequently purchased or made such knives for self-defense, and the stiletto was used by anarchists as well as by members of various Black Hand organizations to assassinate Italian-Americans and others who either opposed the Black Hand or ignored its demands for blackmail. The Black Hand even established schools for training its members in the use of the stiletto.

==First World War==
The emergence of fierce hand-to-hand combat in the trenches of World War I created a new need for stabbing weapons, resulting in the reappearance of the dagger and the stiletto. Many versions of these stabbing knives exist, some individually made by soldiers, while others were government-procured and authorized. On the Allied side, the French Lebel M1886 épée (sword) bayonet was frequently cut down and converted into a stiletto or thrusting knife (&quot;Poignard-Baïonnette Lebel&quot;). The French Nail were locally fabricated and converted bayonets, knives and stabbing weapons for use in the First World War. The Mark I trench knife is an American trench knife designed by officers of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) for use in the First World War. The M1917 bayonet was designed to be used with the US M1917 Enfield .30 caliber rifle, as well as with the seven different U.S. trench shotguns. The German &quot;Nahkampfmesser&quot; (translated: &quot;close combat knife&quot;) was the standard issue German combat knife during the First World War, which remained in service in modified form through the end of the Second World War. 

These weapons were used to eliminate sentries in trench raids as well as for personal defense. As a class, these daggers, knives, and stilettos were given the title trench knife.

== Second World War ==
World War II saw a resurgence of the stiletto in the form of combat knives for commando raiding forces and other troops who needed a weapon for silent killing. In late 1940, the famed British hand-to-hand combat instructors William E. Fairbairn and Eric A. Sykes designed the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife, a double-edged dagger with a long narrow point designed to optimize the blade for thrusting, though it was also capable of slashing strokes if the cutting edges were sharpened.

Other variations of the F-S knife soon emerged, including the United States Marine Raider Stiletto, which was based upon the Fairbairn–Sykes knife, and the U.S. V-42 stiletto, designed from the outset to emphasize thrusting over cutting.

==Post-war and successors==
During the 1950s, large numbers of folding switchblade or automatic opening knives with locking blades were imported from Italy to the United States. Most of these switchblades were side-opening designs, though some employed a telescoping blade. These Italian switchblades were commonly and popularly referred to as stilettos, since most incorporated a long, slender blade tapering to a needle-like point, together with a slim-profile handle and vestigial cross-guard. The majority of these Italian stiletto switchblade knives used a now-iconic bayonet or dagger-style blade with a single sabre-grind edge (often unsharpened) and a false edge of varying length. All of these knives lock the blade in the fully open position, and this lock, combined with the stiletto blade profile, enabled the knife to be used as an effective thrusting or stabbing weapon (unlike most U.S. switchblade designs of the day). Though most switchblade stilettos used a single-edge dagger-type blade, many variations exist, including kris and flat ground blades.

As with the medieval stiletto, the stiletto switchblade was designed primarily as an offensive weapon, optimized for thrusting rather than cutting. The Italian style switchblade&#x27;s peculiar properties combined a switchblade&#x27;s easy concealment with the ability to make a surprise offensive thrust and a deep wound capable of reaching vital organs. In use, the knife would normally be concealed from view in the palm with the blade in the closed position. When the target is within range, the blade is quickly opened as part of a continuing underhand thrust into the target&#x27;s torso.

The stiletto switchblade is still produced in Italy and many other countries, and now includes many derivative folding knife designs that incorporate the same basic &#x27;stiletto&#x27; or bayonet-style blade profile, including spring-assist, non-locking, and lock blade variants.

<text>The Ford Aerospace AN/AVQ-10 Pave Knife was an early targeting pod developed by the USAF and US Navy to designate and guide laser-guided bombs.

Pave Knife was developed in 1969 to replace the original, essentially improvised Airborne Laser Designator (ALD) and TRIM pod (see A-6 Intruder). ALD was not a pod but a hand-held laser operated by the weapon systems officer to mark targets for Paveway laser-guided bombs. Pave Knife was a roughly banana-shaped external pod, weighing about 550 kg (1,200 lb), containing a steerable laser and closed-circuit television camera. The weapon systems officer or bombardier/navigator (BN) monitored the TV image with a small Sony TV in the cockpit and steered the laser onto the target with a hand controller, then passing the target information to the aircraft&#x27;s gun sight.

The Pave Knife bid was a firm fixed-price contract, involving design, development, and manufacture of one prototype, which was considered to be of vital nature due to the war in Vietnam.

Ford Aerospace was known at that time as Philco-Ford, Aeronutronics Division, in Newport Beach, California. This facility was recognized for its strong engineering skills in electro-optics and image stabilization. During this time, Philco-Ford was producing the optical heat seeking section of the AIM-9 missile.

A project manager convinced the company to invest (while the bids were being reviewed by the USAF) in creating the specifications for the subcontracts, selecting the subcontractors, preparing contract verbiage, and setting it up to be able to turn on all the engineering and procurement on the day after the winner of the bidding was announced. The remainder of the design, prototype fabrication and system integration was completed within budget, and on-time with delivery accomplished in an astonishing 6 months from the contract award date.

The key subcontractors were Dalmo Victor in the San Francisco Bay peninsula who provided the night vision system. Another contractor provided a very complex power supply with multiple outputs to operate numerous system components, which had to be squeezed into a semi-oval shape to fit against the inner shape of the pod, with protrusions on the power supply to fit into whatever space was left after other components were designed in. Yet another provided the laser designator.

All the subcontractors met their specifications, price, and delivery dates. When the pod was shipped to Florida for testing at Eglin Air Force Base, the system met specifications. It immediately entered testing and performed so well that within a few weeks, it was shipped to Vietnam and placed into service where it met objectives. McDonnell Douglas F-4D-31-MC, &quot;66-7693&quot;, acted as the test-bed at the Armament Development Test Center, and the pod was carried on left inner wing pylon (Station 2), bolted on in an asymmetric configuration which typically included a drop tank on the starboard wing, plus up to two LGBs (on Stations 1 and 8), along with the regular fit of a centerline tank, Sparrows and ECM.

The system used various technologies including image stabilization, night vision, target designation with a laser, and optical tracking to stay with moving ground targets. It had to withstand high G forces as well as very low and very high temperatures. A second jet with a laser-guided bomb using a guidance system provided by Texas Instruments would operate as a team with the first jet and drop the munitions.

Pave Knife was used by F-4 Phantom II and A-6 Intruder aircraft in the attack role. It was used operationally in the Vietnam War; while it had its limitations, it validated the combat utility of laser-guided bombs. The Pave Knife was superseded by the later Pave Spike and Pave Tack systems, and is no longer in service. A dozen USAF F-4Ds of the 433d Tactical Fighter Squadron, all from Block 31, were wired for Pave Knife, a dozen of which pods were built and six deployed to Southeast Asia. Three were held in reserve and three were diverted to the U.S. Navy for use on A-6As of VA-145.

<text>In combinatorics, the factorial number system, also called factoradic, is a mixed radix numeral system adapted to numbering permutations. It is also called factorial base, although factorials do not function as base, but as place value of digits. By converting a number less than &quot;n&quot;! to factorial representation, one obtains a sequence of &quot;n&quot; digits that can be converted to a permutation of &quot;n&quot; elements in a straightforward way, either using them as Lehmer code or as inversion table representation; in the
former case the resulting map from integers to permutations of &quot;n&quot; elements lists them in lexicographical order. General mixed radix systems were studied by Georg Cantor.

The term &quot;factorial number system&quot; is used by Knuth,
while the French equivalent &quot;numération factorielle&quot; was first used in 1888. The term &quot;factoradic&quot;, which is a portmanteau of factorial and mixed radix, appears to be of more recent date.

== Definition ==

The factorial number system is a mixed radix numeral system: the &quot;i&quot;-th digit from the right has base &quot;i&quot;, which means that the digit must be strictly less than &quot;i&quot;, and that (taking into account the bases of the less significant digits) its value is to be multiplied by ! (its place value).

From this it follows that the rightmost digit is always 0, the second can be 0 or 1, the third 0, 1 or 2, and so on . The factorial number system is sometimes defined with the 0! place omitted because it is always zero .

In this article, a factorial number representation will be flagged by a subscript &quot;!&quot;. In addition, some examples will have digits delimited by a colon. For example, 3:4:1:0:1:0! stands for

: 3×5! + 4×4! + 1×3! + 0×2! + 1×1! + 0×0! 
: ((((3×5 + 4)×4 + 1)×3 + 0)×2 + 1)×1 + 0
:  46310.

(The place value is the factorial of one less than the radix position, which is why the equation begins with 5! for a 6-digit factoradic number.)

General properties of mixed radix number systems also apply to the factorial number system. For instance, one can convert a number into factorial representation producing digits from right to left, by repeatedly dividing the number by the radix (1, 2, 3, ...), taking the remainder as digits, and continuing with the integer quotient, until this quotient becomes 0.

For example, 46310 can be transformed into a factorial representation by these successive divisions:

The process terminates when the quotient reaches zero. Reading the remainders backward gives 3:4:1:0:1:0!.

In principle, this system may be extended to represent rational numbers, though rather than the natural extension of place values (−1)!, (−2)!, etc., which are undefined, the symmetric choice of radix values &quot;n&quot; = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. after the point may be used instead. Again, the 0 and 1 places may be omitted as these are always zero. The corresponding place values are therefore 1/1, 1/1, 1/2, 1/6, 1/24, ..., 1/&quot;n&quot;!, etc.

== Examples ==

The following sortable table shows the 24 permutations of four elements with different inversion related vectors. The left and right inversion counts formula_1 and formula_2 (the latter often called Lehmer code) are particularly eligible to be interpreted as factorial numbers. formula_1 gives the permutation&#x27;s position in reverse colexicographic order (the default order of this table), and the latter the position in lexicographic order (both counted from 0).

Sorting by a column that has the omissible 0 on the right makes the factorial numbers in that column correspond to the index numbers in the immovable column on the left. The small columns are reflections of the columns next to them, and can be used to bring those in colexicographic order. The rightmost column shows the digit sums of the factorial numbers ( in the tables default order).


For another example, the greatest number that could be represented with six digits would be 543210! which equals 719 in decimal:
:5×5! + 4×4! + 3x3! + 2×2! + 1×1! + 0×0!.

Clearly the next factorial number representation after 5:4:3:2:1:0! is 1:0:0:0:0:0:0! which designates 6! = 72010, the place value for the radix-7 digit. So the former number, and its summed out expression above, is equal to:
:6! − 1.

The factorial number system provides a unique representation for each natural number, with the given restriction on the &quot;digits&quot; used. No number can be represented in more than one way because the sum of consecutive factorials multiplied by their index is always the next factorial minus one:
:formula_4

This can be easily proved with mathematical induction, or simply by noticing that formula_5: subsequent terms cancel each other, leaving the first and last term (see Telescoping series).

However, when using Arabic numerals to write the digits (and not including the subscripts as in the above examples), their simple concatenation becomes ambiguous for numbers having a &quot;digit&quot; greater than 9. The smallest such example is the number 10 × 10! = 36,288,00010, which may be written A0000000000!=10:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0!, but not 100000000000! = 1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0! which denotes 11! = 39,916,80010. Thus using letters A–Z to denote digits 10, 11, 12, ..., 35 as in other base-&quot;N&quot; make the largest representable number 36 × 36! − 1. For arbitrarily greater numbers one has to choose a base for representing individual digits, say decimal, and provide a separating mark between them (for instance by subscripting each digit by its base, also given in decimal, like 24031201, this number also can be written as 2:0:1:0!). In fact the factorial number system itself is not truly a numeral system in the sense of providing a representation for all natural numbers using only a finite alphabet of symbols.

== Permutations ==

There is a natural mapping between the integers (or equivalently the numbers with &quot;n&quot; digits in factorial representation) and permutations of &quot;n&quot; elements in lexicographical order, when the integers are expressed in factoradic form. This mapping has been termed the Lehmer code (or inversion table). For example, with , such a mapping is

In each case, calculating the permutation proceeds by using the leftmost factoradic digit (here, 0, 1, or 2) as the first permutation digit, then removing it from the list of choices (0, 1, and 2). Think of this new list of choices as zero indexed, and use each successive factoradic digit to choose from its remaining elements. If the second factoradic digit is &quot;0&quot; then the first element of the list is selected for the second permutation digit and is then removed from the list. Similarly, if the second factoradic digit is &quot;1&quot;, the second is selected and then removed. The final factoradic digit is always &quot;0&quot;, and since the list now contains only one element, it is selected as the last permutation digit.

The process may become clearer with a longer example. Let&#x27;s say we want the 2982nd permutation of the numbers 0 through 6.
The number 2982 is 4:0:4:1:0:0:0! in factoradic, and that number picks out digits (4,0,6,2,1,3,5) in turn, via indexing a dwindling ordered set of digits and picking out each digit from the set at each turn:
 4:0:4:1:0:0:0! ─► (4,0,6,2,1,3,5)
 factoradic: 4 : 0 : 4 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0!
 sets: (0,1,2,3,4,5,6) ─► (0,1,2,3,5,6) ─► (1,2,3,5,6) ─► (1,2,3,5) ─► (1,3,5) ─► (3,5) ─► (5)
 permutation: (4, 0, 6, 2, 1, 3, 5)

A natural index for the direct product of two permutation groups is the concatenation of two factoradic numbers, with two subscript &quot;!&quot;s.
 concatenated
 decimal factoradics permutation pair
 010 0:0:0!0:0:0! ((0,1,2),(0,1,2))
 110 0:0:0!0:1:0! ((0,1,2),(0,2,1))
 510 0:0:0!2:1:0! ((0,1,2),(2,1,0))
 610 0:1:0!0:0:0! ((0,2,1),(0,1,2))
 710 0:1:0!0:1:0! ((0,2,1),(0,2,1))
 2210 1:1:0!2:0:0! ((1,2,0),(2,0,1))
 3410 2:1:0!2:0:0! ((2,1,0),(2,0,1))
 3510 2:1:0!2:1:0! ((2,1,0),(2,1,0))

== Fractional values ==

Unlike single radix systems whose place values are &quot;base&quot;&quot;n&quot; for both positive and negative integral &quot;n&quot;, the factorial number base cannot be extended to negative place values as these would be (−1)!, (−2)! and so on, and these values are undefined (see factorial).

One possible extension is therefore to use 1/0!, 1/1!, 1/2!, 1/3!, ..., 1/&quot;n&quot;! etc. instead, possibly omitting the 1/0! and 1/1! places which are always zero.

With this method, all rational numbers have a terminating expansion, whose length in &#x27;digits&#x27; is less than or equal to the denominator of the rational number represented. This may be proven by considering that there exists a factorial for any integer and therefore the denominator divides into its own factorial even if it does not divide into any smaller factorial.

By necessity, therefore, the factoradic expansion of the reciprocal of a prime has a length of exactly that prime (less one if the 1/1! place is omitted). Other terms are given as the sequence A046021 on the OEIS. It can also be proven that the last &#x27;digit&#x27; or term of the representation of a rational with prime denominator is equal to the difference between the numerator and the prime denominator.

Similar to how checking the divisibility of 4 in base 10 requires looking at only the last two digits, checking the divisibility of any number in factorial number system requires looking at only a finite number of digits. That is, it has a divisibility rule for each number.

There is also a non-terminating equivalent for every rational number akin to the fact that in decimal 0.24999... = 0.25 = 1/4 and 0.999... = 1, etc., which can be created by reducing the final term by 1 and then filling in the remaining infinite number of terms with the highest value possible for the radix of that position.

In the following selection of examples, spaces are used to separate the place values, otherwise represented in decimal. The rational numbers on the left are also in decimal:

* formula_6
* formula_7
* formula_8
* formula_9
* formula_10
* formula_11
* formula_12
* formula_13
* formula_14

* formula_16
* formula_17
* formula_18

* formula_31
* formula_32
* formula_33
* formula_34
* formula_35
* formula_36
* formula_37
* formula_38

* formula_44
* formula_45

<text>In mathematics, and in particular in combinatorics, the combinatorial number system of degree &quot;k&quot; (for some positive integer &quot;k&quot;), also referred to as combinadics, or the Macaulay representation of an integer, is a correspondence between natural numbers (taken to include 0) &quot;N&quot; and &quot;k&quot;-combinations. The combinations are represented as strictly decreasing sequences &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; &gt; ... &gt; &quot;c&quot;2 &gt; &quot;c&quot;1 ≥ 0 where each &quot;ci&quot; corresponds to the index of a chosen element in a given &quot;k&quot;-combination. Distinct numbers correspond to distinct &quot;k&quot;-combinations, and produce them in lexicographic order. The numbers less than formula_1 correspond to all of }. The correspondence does not depend on the size &quot;n&quot; of the set that the &quot;k&quot;-combinations are taken from, so it can be interpreted as a map from N to the &quot;k&quot;-combinations taken from N; in this view the correspondence is a bijection.

The number &quot;N&quot; corresponding to (&quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;, ..., &quot;c&quot;2, &quot;c&quot;1) is given by

:formula_2.

The fact that a unique sequence corresponds to any non-negative number &quot;N&quot; was first observed by D. H. Lehmer. Indeed, a greedy algorithm finds the &quot;k&quot;-combination corresponding to &quot;N&quot;: take &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; maximal with formula_3, then take &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 maximal with formula_4, and so forth. Finding the number &quot;N&quot;, using the formula above, from the &quot;k&quot;-combination (&quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;, ..., &quot;c&quot;2, &quot;c&quot;1) is also known as &quot;ranking&quot;, and the opposite operation (given by the greedy algorithm) as &quot;unranking&quot;; the operations are known by these names in most computer algebra systems, and in computational mathematics.

The originally used term &quot;combinatorial representation of integers&quot; was shortened to &quot;combinatorial number system&quot; by Knuth,
who also gives a much older reference;
the term &quot;combinadic&quot; is introduced by James McCaffrey (without reference to previous terminology or work).

Unlike the factorial number system, the combinatorial number system of degree &quot;k&quot; is not a mixed radix system: the part formula_5 of the number &quot;N&quot; represented by a &quot;digit&quot; &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; is not obtained from it by simply multiplying by a place value.

The main application of the combinatorial number system is that it allows rapid computation of the &quot;k&quot;-combination that is at a given position in the lexicographic ordering, without having to explicitly list the preceding it; this allows for instance random generation of &quot;k&quot;-combinations of a given set. Enumeration of &quot;k&quot;-combinations has many applications, among which are software testing, sampling, quality control, and the analysis of lottery games.

== Ordering combinations ==

A &quot;k&quot;-combination of a set &quot;S&quot; is a subset of &quot;S&quot; with &quot;k&quot; (distinct) elements. The main purpose of the combinatorial number system is to provide a representation, each by a single number, of all formula_1 possible &quot;k&quot;-combinations of a set &quot;S&quot; of &quot;n&quot; elements. Choosing, for any &quot;n&quot;, } as such a set, it can be arranged that the representation of a given &quot;k&quot;-combination &quot;C&quot; is independent of the value of &quot;n&quot; (although &quot;n&quot; must of course be sufficiently large); in other words considering &quot;C&quot; as a subset of a larger set by increasing &quot;n&quot; will not change the number that represents &quot;C&quot;. Thus for the combinatorial number system one just considers &quot;C&quot; as a &quot;k&quot;-combination of the set N of all natural numbers, without explicitly mentioning &quot;n&quot;.

In order to ensure that the numbers representing the &quot;k&quot;-combinations of } are less than those representing &quot;k&quot;-combinations not contained in }, the &quot;k&quot;-combinations must be ordered in such a way that their largest elements are compared first. The most natural ordering that has this property is lexicographic ordering of the &quot;decreasing&quot; sequence of their elements. So comparing the 5-combinations &quot;C&quot; = {0,3,4,6,9} and &quot;C&quot;′ = {0,1,3,7,9}, one has that &quot;C&quot; comes before &quot;C&quot;′, since they have the same largest part 9, but the next largest part 6 of &quot;C&quot; is less than the next largest part 7 of &quot;C&quot;′; the sequences compared lexicographically are (9,6,4,3,0) and (9,7,3,1,0).

Another way to describe this ordering is view combinations as describing the &quot;k&quot; raised bits in the binary representation of a number, so that &quot;C&quot; = {&quot;c&quot;1, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;} describes the number
:formula_7
(this associates distinct numbers to &quot;all&quot; finite sets of natural numbers); then comparison of &quot;k&quot;-combinations can be done by comparing the associated binary numbers. In the example &quot;C&quot; and &quot;C&quot;′ correspond to numbers 10010110012 = 60110 and 10100010112 = 65110, which again shows that &quot;C&quot; comes before &quot;C&quot;′. This number is not however the one one wants to represent the &quot;k&quot;-combination with, since many binary numbers have a number of raised bits different from &quot;k&quot;; one wants to find the relative position of &quot;C&quot; in the ordered list of (only) .

== Place of a combination in the ordering ==

The number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree &quot;k&quot; to a &quot;k&quot;-combination &quot;C&quot; is the number of &quot;k&quot;-combinations strictly less than &quot;C&quot; in the given ordering. This number can be computed from &quot;C&quot; = {&quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;, ..., &quot;c&quot;2, &quot;c&quot;1} with &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; &gt; ... &gt; &quot;c&quot;2 &gt; &quot;c&quot;1 as follows.

From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each &quot;k&quot;-combination &quot;S&quot; strictly less than &quot;C&quot;, there is a unique index &quot;i&quot; such that &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; is absent from &quot;S&quot;, while &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 are present in &quot;S&quot;, and no other value larger than &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; is. One can therefore group those &quot;S&quot; according to the possible values 1, 2, ..., &quot;k&quot; of &quot;i&quot;, and count each group separately. For a given value of &quot;i&quot; one must include
&quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot;, ..., &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 in &quot;S&quot;, and the remaining &quot;i&quot; elements of &quot;S&quot; must be chosen from the &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; non-negative integers strictly less than &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot;; moreover any such choice will result in a &quot;S&quot; strictly less than &quot;C&quot;. The number of possible choices is formula_5, which is therefore the number of combinations in group &quot;i&quot;; the total number of &quot;k&quot;-combinations strictly less than &quot;C&quot; then is
:formula_9
and this is the index (starting from 0) of &quot;C&quot; in the ordered list of &quot;k&quot;-combinations.

Obviously there is for every &quot;N&quot; ∈ N exactly one &quot;k&quot;-combination at index &quot;N&quot; in the list (supposing &quot;k&quot; ≥ 1, since the list is then infinite), so the above argument proves that every &quot;N&quot; can be written in exactly one way as a sum of &quot;k&quot; binomial coefficients of the given form.

== Finding the &quot;k&quot;-combination for a given number ==

The given formula allows finding the place in the lexicographic ordering of a given &quot;k&quot;-combination immediately. The reverse process of finding the &quot;k&quot;-combination at a given place &quot;N&quot; requires somewhat more work, but is straightforward nonetheless. By the definition of the lexicographic ordering, two &quot;k&quot;-combinations that differ in their largest element &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; will be ordered according to the comparison of those largest elements, from which it follows that all combinations with a fixed value of their largest element are contiguous in the list. Moreover the smallest combination with &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; as the largest element is formula_10, and it has &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; = &quot;i&quot; − 1 for all &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;k&quot; (for this combination all terms in the expression except formula_10 are zero). Therefore &quot;c&quot;&quot;k&quot; is the largest number such that formula_3. If &quot;k&quot; &gt; 1 the remaining elements of the &quot;k&quot;-combination form the -combination corresponding to the number formula_13 in the combinatorial number system of degree , and can therefore be found by continuing in the same way for formula_13 and instead of &quot;N&quot; and &quot;k&quot;.

=== Example ===

Suppose one wants to determine the 5-combination at position 72. The successive values of formula_15 for &quot;n&quot; = 4, 5, 6, ... are 0, 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, 252, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 72 is 56, for &quot;n&quot; = 8. Therefore &quot;c&quot;5 = 8, and the remaining elements form the at position . The successive values of formula_16 for &quot;n&quot; = 3, 4, 5, ... are 0, 1, 5, 15, 35, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 16 is 15, for &quot;n&quot; = 6, so &quot;c&quot;4 = 6. Continuing similarly to search for a 3-combination at position one finds &quot;c&quot;3 = 3, which uses up the final unit; this establishes formula_17, and the remaining values &quot;c&quot;&quot;i&quot; will be the maximal ones with formula_18, namely . Thus we have found the 5-combination }.

== National Lottery example ==

For each of the formula_19 lottery combinations &quot;c&quot;1 &lt; &quot;c&quot;2 &lt; &quot;c&quot;3 &lt; &quot;c&quot;4 &lt; &quot;c&quot;5 &lt; &quot;c&quot;6 , there is a list number &quot;N&quot; between 0 and formula_20 which can be found by adding

: formula_21

<text>Chicago XI is the ninth studio album by the American rock band Chicago. It was released on September 12, 1977, through Columbia Records. It was both the last to feature guitarist and vocalist Terry Kath prior to his death in a gun accident just over four months later, and the last to be produced by longtime band associate James William Guercio.

&quot;Chicago XI&quot; was a commercial and critical success for the band, reaching the top 10 in the US and garnering generally positive reviews. Three singles were released from the album—&quot;Baby, What a Big Surprise&quot;, &quot;Little One&quot;, and &quot;Take Me Back to Chicago&quot;—with the former reaching number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Chicago XI&quot; would become the band&#x27;s last album to make the top 10 until &quot;Chicago 16&quot; in 1982.

The cover design for the album is called &quot;Regional Map&quot; on the group&#x27;s official website.

==Background==
According to the web site &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;Chicago XI&quot; seems like a collection of solo songs rather than the work of the ensemble whole Chicago had been earlier in the 1970s. Peter Cetera aimed to replicate the success of the Grammy-winning &quot;If You Leave Me Now&quot; with &quot;Baby, What a Big Surprise&quot;, which proved to be the album&#x27;s biggest hit, going to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This was his only writing contribution to the album and, quite atypically, the only song with him on lead vocals. Terry Kath revived his old live favorite &quot;Mississippi Delta City Blues&quot; for the album, while turning in a touching vocal on Danny Seraphine&#x27;s &quot;Little One.&quot; Seraphine also co-wrote &quot;Take Me Back to Chicago&quot;, which charted at No. 63.

Kath, who was planning a forthcoming solo album, may have intended &quot;Takin&#x27; It On Uptown&quot; — which, besides some uncredited backup singers, possibly features only Kath himself — as a solo album &quot;preview&quot; along the lines of Lamm&#x27;s &quot;Skinny Boy&quot; on &quot;Chicago VII&quot;. James Pankow sang lead on his own &quot;Till the End of Time,&quot; as did Lee Loughnane on his original, &quot;This Time.&quot; The once prolific Robert Lamm contributed only two songs, &quot;Policeman&quot; and &quot;Vote For Me.&quot;

Upon its September 1977 release, &quot;Chicago XI&quot; (Columbia 34860) reached No. 6 in the US on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, stayed in the charts for 20 weeks and went platinum in October the same year. It did not chart in the UK.

While recording &quot;Chicago XI,&quot; longtime producer James William Guercio&#x27;s smothering artistic control had reached its breaking point, with the band deciding to take their career into their own hands and strike out on their own after finishing the album with him. However, as big a change in their career as Guercio&#x27;s dismissal would be for Chicago, it would be minor in comparison to the tragedy that awaited them.

On January 23, 1978, a few months after &quot;Chicago XI&quot;″s release, Terry Kath, regarded by many as the &quot;soul&quot; of Chicago, accidentally and fatally shot himself during a party at roadie Don Johnson&#x27;s house. A gun enthusiast, Kath attempted to calm the guests&#x27; surprise when—while reportedly inebriated—he pulled out his gun to clean it by demonstrating that it was unloaded and promptly pointed the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, not realizing a bullet was in the chamber. The remaining members of Chicago were shocked and devastated by Kath&#x27;s death, and even considered breaking up. After a few weeks of mourning, they decided to move on, thus beginning a new era in the band&#x27;s history. They would recruit singer/guitarist Donnie Dacus for the follow-up, &quot;Hot Streets&quot;.

In 2002, &quot;Chicago XI&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with rehearsal recordings of Pankow&#x27;s &quot;Wish I Could Fly&quot; (backing track) and Lamm&#x27;s &quot;Paris&quot; as bonus tracks.

==Critical reception==

In her review of the album for &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, Christine Hogan said, &quot;If there had never been a &quot;Chicago X&quot;, this album would have been the best ever made by these perennials.&quot; Writing for &quot;The Evening Journal&quot;, Hugh Cutler called the album a &quot;critical and commercial triumph&quot; and said it even drew a &quot;rave review&quot; from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

&quot;Record World&quot; described the single &quot;Little One&quot; as &quot;a mid-tempo love song,&quot; saying that &quot;the brass and vocal arrangements stand out as always.&quot;

<text>Xue Yue (December 26, 1896 – May 3, 1998) was a Chinese Nationalist military general, nicknamed the &quot;Patton of Asia&quot; by Claire Lee Chennault of the Flying Tigers.

==Early life and career==

Born to a peasant family in Shaoguan, Guangdong, Xue joined the Tongmenghui in 1909. In the Spring of 1912, he was admitted to the Guangdong Military Primary School. In 1917, he was admitted to the sixth class of the Baoding Military Academy. However, in July 1918, he departed south for Guangzhou and joined an army created by Sun Yat-sen and Chen Jiongming with the rank of captain. Afterwards, he became commander of the first battalion of Sun&#x27;s bodyguard. When Sun and Chen fell out, Xue escorted Soong Ching-Ling to safety.

Xue was one of the most effective nationalist commanders of the Northern Expedition, serving as the commander of the 1st Division of the 1st Army. After the April 12 Incident, he recommended that Chiang Kai-shek be arrested as a counterrevolutionary. Purged from the 1st Army, Xue returned to Guangdong to serve as a divisional commander under Li Jishen. After political turmoil that saw Chiang return to power, Xue joined Zhang Fakui and served in the Guangdong 4th Army. During the Guangzhou Uprising, Xue&#x27;s troops were called into the city to help suppress the Communists. Due to losses suffered over the course of the latter part of 1927, the 4th Army accepted Chiang&#x27;s offer to reorganize. However, internal divisions saw newly appointed commander Miao Peinan forced out and Zhang Fakui&#x27;s return as commander of the Guangdong 4th Army. Xue was promoted to become Zhang&#x27;s deputy.

During the Central Plains War, the Guangdong 4th Army supported the New Guangxi Clique in opposing Chiang. During the combined forces&#x27; entry into Hengyang, their line of retreat was cut off by Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai. In the ensuing Battle of Hengyang, the combined Guangdong-Guangxi army suffered a serious defeat. The Guangdong 4th Army was forced to join Chiang, Zhang Fakui was forced to resign, and Xue was promoted to command of the army.

During the first stage of the Chinese Civil War, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek ordered General Xue to lead the Guangdong First Army to attack the Chinese communists during the Fifth Encirclement Campaign against Jiangxi Soviet, forcing them to start the Long March and his forces chased the retreating communists all the way to Sichuan and Guizhou, until the communist forces retreated across the great swamplands and finally escaped to Shaanxi Province. He then turned his forces around and marched unstopped to Central China and defeated the famed Red Army commanders like He Long and Ye Ting of the communist area which they controlled and forced them out of these strongholds. For these accomplishments, Chiang Kai-shek hailed him as &quot;a true example of a Chinese officer&quot;.

==Second Sino-Japanese War==
After the Xi&#x27;an Incident, however, Xue&#x27;s loyalty was in doubt after he offered to personally arrest Chiang Kai-shek and hand him over to the Communists if Chiang refused to fight the Japanese immediately. Although he immediately reconciled with Chiang Kai-shek, his relations with the KMT were strained throughout the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Xue commanded the 19th Army Group that fought the Battle of Shanghai. Later, during the Campaign of Battle of Northern and Eastern Henan (January–June 1938) he commanded the Eastern Henan Army.

Xue was also involved in the Battle of Wuhan, commanding the 1st Army Corps. In the mountains northwest of Wuhan, Xue succeeded in nearly destroying the entire 106th division of the imperial Japanese army. During the battle, most of the Japanese officers were killed and the Japanese had to air-drop 300 officers by parachutes into the battlefield. This was the only occasion the Imperial Japanese Army had to use airborne strategy to save a whole division from being eliminated by enemy forces during the Second World War.

Xue Yue was also responsible for the victories of the 9th Front, in the First, Second and Third Battle for Changsha. His forces of the 9th Front were also victorious at the Battle of Changde but were defeated in the Fourth Battle of Changsha.

The KMT and General Stilwell would not support him or supply his soldiers with ammunition to fight the Japanese due to Stillwell&#x27;s belief that there was rampant corruption in the KMT Army that resulted in generals or KMT officials diverting resources away from the battlefield. To Stillwell&#x27;s dismay, however, Chennault&#x27;s air forces supplied Xue with ammunition throughout the war, whenever this was possible. Xue&#x27;s 9th Front was also responsible for protecting Chennault&#x27;s airfields.

Chennault and Xue became sworn brothers and remained close friends until Chennault&#x27;s death in 1958. Chennault also recounts in his memoirs, &quot;Way of a Fighter,&quot; that in July 1945, just as Chennault had resigned, he made a trip over enemy lines to see Xue Yue. (In his memoirs, Chennault refers to Xue Yue as Hsueh Yo). Xue had marched for two days to get to the meeting, but Chennault was only able to disappoint him in his quest for arms and ammunition to launch a counteroffensive: Chennault&#x27;s superiors had taken everything for an effort being organized in Chongqing. And so:

==Chinese Civil War and later career==
After World War II, Xue refused to exchange his gold for the Gold Yuan paper currency as mandated by law. When Huang Shaoxiong informed Xue that this was illegal, Xue responded that he and his subordinates&#x27; gold was paid for in blood and he was personally responsible for it.

When Chiang Kai-shek retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Xue was put in charge of defending Hainan Island. The victorious Red Army defeated the demoralized Nationalist Forces. Xue left for Taiwan after the defense of Hainan collapsed. In Taiwan, he served as adviser to the chief of staff, in name only. He was Master of Ceremony, an honorary title, at Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s funeral in 1975. He lived until 1998 to the age of 101.

<text>Cognac (; Saintongese: &quot;Cougnat&quot;; ) is a commune in the Charente department, southwestern France. Administratively, the commune of Cognac is a subprefecture of the Charente department.

==Name==

The name is believed to be formed from individual masculine name -Connius, Gallic name, and the suffix -acum, which would correspond to the &quot;domain of Connius&quot;.

==History==
The town of Cognac was unknown before the ninth century, when it was fortified. During the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the town continually changed sides, according to the tides of war. In 1526, it lent its name to the War of the League of Cognac, the military alliance established by King Francis I of France to fight against the House of Habsburg. As a benefit of the War League of Cognac, King Francis I granted to the town of Cognac the commercial right to participate in the salt trade conducted along the river, from which regional Cognac developed into a centre for the production of wine and brandy.

In November 1651, Cognac was besieged by rebels led by Prince de Condé during the 1648-1653 civil war, the &quot;Fronde&quot;; and the town was relieved in December by a force under Comte d&#x27;Harcourt; afterwards, King Louis XIV granted Cognac additional commercial rights.
Cognac was part of the historic French province of Angoumois. In 1790, following the French Revolution that began the year before, the provinces were abolished and Angoumois became part of the newly created department of Charente.

==Geography==
Cognac is situated on the river Charente between the towns of Angoulême and Saintes. The greater part of the town has been built on the river&#x27;s left bank, with the smaller right bank area known as the Saint Jacques district. The town is situated on one of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostela and is home to the French Air Force training base 709. Cognac is southwest of Paris.

==Culture==
The Festival Polar de Cognac has been held each year since 1996. With a focus on crime fiction and thrillers, it showcases and awards prizes to novels, comic books, film, theatre, and television

==Cognac brandy==

The town gives its name to one of the world&#x27;s best-known types of brandy or eau de vie. Drinks must be made in certain areas around the town of Cognac and must be made according to strictly defined regulations to be granted the name Cognac.

Cognac is a unique spirit in that it is double-distilled. This process can be viewed in one of the many &quot;Grande Marque&quot; Cognac houses which all have visitor centres. Most central in the town are Hennessy, Martell, Otard, Camus and Remy Martin. About east of Cognac is Jarnac, home to Courvoisier.

There are six vineyard areas around the Cognac area, all of which are within the Appellation Controlee for Cognac, but which are considered to vary in quality from the best growth area of &quot;Grande Champagne&quot; (nothing to do with the Champagne wine region in NE France), through &quot;Petite Champagne&quot; then &quot;Borderies&quot;, &quot;Fins Bois&quot;, &quot;Bon Bois&quot; and finally &quot;Bois Ordinaire&quot;. All Cognac is produced by blending a variety of &quot;eau de vie&quot; which can be made from grapes from different locations, and from different vintages. It is the cellar master&#x27;s skill that ensures that a brand&#x27;s Cognac is recognizable regardless of when it is produced, since he can blend multiple &quot;eaux de vie&quot; to achieve the right taste for his house.

Different qualities of Cognac are produced by all brands, and include VS (&quot;Very Special&quot;); VSOP (&quot;Very Superior [or, more commonly, &quot;Special&quot;, though the Bureau National Interprofessionnel du Cognac specifies &quot;Superior&quot;] Old Pale&quot;) and XO (&quot;eXtra Old&quot;). (English terms are still used, since in the early days of Cognac production it was the British who were the main consumers and also became some of the main producers of Cognac, using techniques acquired from the distillation of whisky, etc.) These are controlled by the length of time the Cognac is allowed to mature in oak barrels, a minimum time being required at each grade level. The longer the Cognac matures in the barrel the smoother it will generally become. Once it is bottled no further development takes place. Most houses still have barrels of Cognac dating back to the 19th century sitting in their cellars waiting for fine blending by the Cellar Master.

==Climate==
Cognac has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Cognac is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in July, at around , and lowest in January, at around .

<text>Tranmere is a suburb of Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula, England. Administratively, it is within the Birkenhead and Tranmere Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in Merseyside. Before local government reorganisation on 1 April 1974, it was part of the County Borough of Birkenhead, within the county of Cheshire.

At the 2001 census, the population of Tranmere was 11,668. By the 2011 census the suburb was combined with the centre of Birkenhead. The population was recorded as 15,879.

==History==
Its name was given by Norwegian Vikings who settled and colonised Wirral in the 10th century. Tranmere in Old Norse is &quot;Trani-melr&quot;, meaning &quot;crane (bird) sandbank&quot; or &quot;sandbank with the cranes&quot;.

Until the early 19th century, Tranmere was the second most populous settlement in Wirral, with a population of 353 in 1801, centred mainly in the area of what is now Church Road and the nearby hamlet of Hinderton. By 1901, the number of residents had grown to 37,709.

Tranmere Old Hall and its estate, was situated around what is now Church Road. It was a large, gabled building constructed around 1614. 
According to the author Philip Sulley&#x27;s &quot;The Hundred of Wirral&quot; (1889), in about 1860: 
... [Tranmere Old Hall] was pulled down by an ignorant boor who became possessed of it by some mischance, to make way for shops and houses.

Tranmere was historically a township in the ancient parish of Bebington in the Wirral Hundred of Cheshire. The township was made a local government district in 1860, governed by a local board. In 1866 Tranmere became a separate civil parish. The local government district was abolished in 1877 and its area was incorporated into the new municipal borough of Birkenhead. Tranmere continued to be a civil parish within the borough until 31 March 1898 when all the parishes within the borough were merged into a single parish. In 1891 the parish had a population of 30,680. On creation of the county of Merseyside in 1974, Tranmere became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral.

The Ingleborough Road Memorial Playing Fields were part of the now defunct Birkenhead Institute school from 1925 and opened for use the following year. The fields and pavilion were created as a memorial to the former students of the school killed in action in World War I, which included the poet Wilfred Owen. Ornamental gates were added to the site in 1933. 
The site was purchased by Tranmere Rovers Football Club in 1995. 
Despite opposition, the land was redeveloped for housing in 2012.

===Ferry service===
Queen Elizabeth granted John Poole the lease of ferry rights at Tranmere in 1586. The &quot;Etna&quot;, the first steam-powered ferry on the River Mersey, operated from Tranmere Pool to Liverpool on 17 April 1817. 
The early part of the 19th century was a prosperous time for Tranmere&#x27;s ferry service, but this was to change with the completion of Thomas Brassey&#x27;s New Chester Road in 1833 and the opening of the Chester and Birkenhead Railway in 1840. Further blows to trade came with the commencement of a horse-drawn tramway in 1877 between New Ferry and Woodside Ferry and the opening of the Mersey Railway between Liverpool and nearby Green Lane railway station in 1886. By 1904, the ferry service had ceased and Tranmere Pool was enclosed as Cammell Laird Dock as part of an extension of the shipyard.

===Air raid shelter===
Tranmere contains one of the largest and most expensive World War II air raid shelters in the country. The shelter consists of a series of tunnels stretching to a total length of , and was designed to house up to 6,000 people; many of them workers at the strategically important Cammell Laird shipyard. By the time the tunnels were completed, they were no longer needed as the threat of invasion had diminished. The tunnels were later used by the Ministry of Food for storage, and were considered as a nuclear fallout shelter during the Cold War era. The tunnels were sealed in 1989, amid growing health and safety concerns. The tunnels still exist and building work in 2008 uncovered a shaft, which allowed temporary exploration, before being sealed again.

==Geography==
Tranmere is situated on the eastern side of the Wirral Peninsula, at the western side of the River Mersey. The area is approximately south-south-east of the Irish Sea at New Brighton and about east-north-east of the Dee Estuary at Thurstaston. Tranmere is at an elevation of between above sea level, with the highest point to the south of St Catherine&#x27;s Hospital.

==Governance==
Tranmere is within the parliamentary constituency of Birkenhead. The current Member of Parliament is Mick Whitley, a Labour representative.

At local government level, the area is mostly incorporated into the Birkenhead and Tranmere Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, in the metropolitan county of Merseyside. (A small portion to the south of Green Lane station is now part of the Rock Ferry Ward.) Representation on Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council is undertaken by three councillors. The most recent local elections took place on 6 May 2021.

==Community==
Tranmere is made up of industrial buildings and Victorian terraced houses, although it has seen a significant amount of property development recently. From 2005, the area was one of the 35 government neighbourhood pathfinder areas.

===Education===
Mersey Park Primary School serves the area.

===Healthcare===
St Catherine&#x27;s Health Centre occupies a large site in Higher Tranmere. The original facility on the site was built as the Birkenhead Union Workhouse between 1861 and 1863 and designed by Thomas Leyland. Around 2013, the Victorian hospital buildings were replaced with a modern medical facility and community centre.

===Green spaces===
Two urban parks are located in Tranmere. Mersey Park to the north and Victoria Park to the south. Mersey Park hosts one of several annual Bonfire Night municipal firework displays put on by Wirral Borough Council. Victoria Park contains a community hall at the bottom of Albany Road, a cricket pitch and clubhouse. Victoria Park was originally the gardens of a large property called The Towers, built in the 1860s as a French-style chateau by Victor Poutz, a French cotton merchant.

==Landmarks==

At the top end of Victoria Park stands the Tranmere Cross, a cross fragment with a worn stone base, believed to have originated . The structure is a designated Grade II listed building that was put on the present site in 1937 and which once marked the entrance to Tranmere on Church Road.

==Sport==
Tranmere is best known for its football club, Tranmere Rovers F.C., founded in 1884. Tranmere Rovers now plays at nearby Prenton Park, in Birkenhead itself, but has kept the Tranmere name.

==Transport==
Green Lane railway station is situated on the Wirral line of the Merseyrail network. Services operate northbound to Liverpool, via Birkenhead town centre and southbound to Chester and Ellesmere Port.

==Notable people==
First World War poet Wilfred Owen lived at three successive homes in Tranmere during the time his father was Stationmaster at Woodside from 1898 to 1907 and was a pupil at the nearby Birkenhead Institute School, now defunct.

Mersey Park Primary School has several famous former pupils including Jason McAteer (footballer) and Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth Bucket in the BBC TV sitcom &quot;Keeping up Appearances&quot;). Paul O&#x27;Grady, famous for his alter-ego creation Lily Savage, was raised in the area.

Colin Haygarth, The Queen Mother&#x27;s gunmaker from 1965 until 2002, was born in Tranmere. He lived in Milton Road until he was four years old, when his family moved to nearby Irby. As a teen during the Second World War, he made parts for Sten guns in the workshops of the gunmaker W.C. Carswell in Liverpool and also served in the Irby branch of the Home Guard. In 1957 he started &quot;C H Haygarth&quot;, a gun- and rifle-making business in the Scottish Highlands.

<text>Glen Marshall Findlay (born July 15, 1940) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1999, and a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1999.

The son of Marshall F. Findlay and Verna B. Cochrane, he was born in Shoal Lake, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and the University of Illinois. He worked as a farmer on his family&#x27;s 5,000 acre beef farm after returning to the province, and was a professor in the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Manitoba from 1970 to 1977. He married Katherine E. Kennedy.

Findlay was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1986, easily winning the rural riding of Virden as a Progressive Conservative. The election was narrowly won by the New Democratic Party under Howard Pawley, and Findlay joined 25 other Conservatives in the official opposition.

The Pawley government fell in 1988, when disgruntled backbencher Jim Walding voted against his own government. Findlay was re-elected without difficulty in the general election which followed, and was appointed Minister of Agriculture with responsibility for the Manitoba Telephone System on May 9, 1988.

The Virden riding was eliminated by redistribution in the 1990 election and Findlay ran in the riding of Springfield, where he defeated NDP candidate Deborah Barron-McNabb by almost 2,000 votes. He endorsed Jean Charest&#x27;s bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in June 1993.

On September 10, 1993, he was named Minister of Highways and Transportation, retaining responsibility for the provincial telephone system. He was re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, again defeating his NDP opponent by about 2000 votes. In 1996, Findlay was responsible for coordinating the government&#x27;s highly controversial decision to sell the MTS.

Findlay left cabinet on February 5, 1999, and did not seek re-election later in the year. In 2000, he was appointed to a federal panel reviewing the Canada Transportation Act. In 2006, he was appointed by the federal government to the board of directors of the Canadian Wheat Board.

<text>London General Transport Services Limited, trading as Go-Ahead London, is a bus company operating in Greater London. The London General brand is a subsidiary of Go-Ahead London and operates services under contract to Transport for London. The company is named after the London General Omnibus Company, the principal operator of buses in London between 1855 and 1933.
==History==

In April 1989, London Buses was divided into 11 separate business units, one of which revived the London General Omnibus Company name as London General Transport Services; the new London General&#x27;s original logo featured a representation of a LGOC B-type bus in reflection of the name&#x27;s history.

In November 1994, London General was sold in a management buyout for £28 million (), before being sold to the Go-Ahead Group for £46 million () in May 1996.

Having previously been based at London General House in Mitcham, Surrey, the company moved its offices to an address in Merton, adjacent to the Merton bus garage. In August 2008, Go-Ahead&#x27;s London bus operations all adopted the Go-Ahead London trading name, although the individual company names are still applied beneath the logo on most buses.

In August 2009, Go-Ahead purchased East Thames Buses from Transport for London for £5 million, incorporating the business, consisting of two small bus garages, 133 buses and 460 employees, into London General. Although Transport for London&#x27;s normal practice is to put routes out for tender, London General began a new five-year contract for all East Thames Buses routes without going through the tendering process.

In March 2012, First London&#x27;s Northumberland Park garage was purchased by the Go-Ahead Group for £14 million and integrated into London Central&#x27;s operations. On 1 April 2014, the London operations of Metrobus, based at two garages in Croydon and Orpington, were integrated into London General. On 25 April 2014, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency formally increased London General&#x27;s licence to accommodate the Metrobus buses.

==Garages==
London General operates nine bus garages.

===Goat Road (GM)===
As of March 2024, Goat Road garage operates routes 80 (hybrid allocation only), 280 and 470. Buses are regularly shared with Merton garage.

Goat Road was opened on 25 March 2023 as a replacement for Waterside Way (PL) garage, acquired from East Thames Buses in 2009, with routes, staff and vehicles transferring from Waterside Way after London General&#x27;s lease on the site expired. The depot uses the code &#x27;GM&#x27;, last used for the operator&#x27;s Victoria garage on Gillingham Street.

===Merton (AL)===

As of March 2024, Merton garage operates routes 57, 131, 152, 157, 163, 164, 200, 219, 413, 485 and 493. Some buses are regularly shared with Goat Road garage. This garage also runs the St. Bede&#x27;s School private bus services 514 and 519, which run between the Caterham area and the school, on behalf of Surrey County Council.

====History====
Merton was, for many years, the largest of the London General Omnibus Company&#x27;s garages and continued to boast high allocations in the early days of London Transport. The garage was modernised in 1960, and again in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, unobstructed parking area, which had previously been long and narrow. 

Merton garage was responsible for the maintenance of vehicles for route 200 between 1988 and 1989 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.

The garage has become Go-Ahead London&#x27;s head office, following the sale of Raleigh House, Mitcham and the acquisition of the former pub (King&#x27;s Head, Merton) next door.

===Northumberland Park (NP)===
As of August 2024, Northumberland Park garage operates routes 67, 91, 106, 184, 212, 217, 230, 232, 299, 357, 389, 399, 444, 456, 476, 657, N91 and W15.

====History====
Located adjacent to the Northumberland Park railway station and the Victoria Line depot, Northumberland Park bus garage was opened in 1991 to house the Walthamstow Citybus operation, a subsidiary of Capital Citybus formed when the operator acquired tenders for routes operated by the collapsed London Forest LRT business unit. Capital Citybus was bought out by a management team in late 1995, and subsequently by FirstGroup in 1998, becoming First Capital.

In March 2012, the FirstGroup sold Northumberland Park garage, together with its 13 Transport for London route contracts, fleet of 130 buses vehicles and around 400 staff members, to the Go-Ahead Group for £12 million, with the garage&#x27;s operations integrated into London General.

===Putney (AF)===

As of July 2023, Putney garage operates routes 14, 22, 39, 74, 209, 265, 378, 430, 533, N22, N74 and N97.

====History====
With its ancestry going back to the horse bus days of the 1880s, Chelverton Road Garage was converted to a motor-bus garage in 1912. The garage is well hidden in a side road with a modest frontage, yet it has an allocation of 112. It has been modernised twice, firstly in 1935 and then again in 1985. The garage was well known for being allocated the pre-war RTs in 1940, which displaced the STLs. During the war the garage was under-utilised and was used to store de-licensed buses. Renamed Putney, in 1963, after the closure of Putney Bridge Garage (F), it started to receive both short and long wheelbase AEC Routemasters for its Central London routes. The Routemasters remained at the garage until July 2005, when both the 14 and 22 were converted to low floor one-person-operated buses.

===Croydon (C)===
As of March 2024, Croydon garage operates routes 119, 127, 264, 359, 403, 434, 439, 450, 463, 633, 663, S1 and SL7. Some drivers for route 157 are based at this garage.

====History====
The Beddington Lane depot was opened by Metrobus in December 2005 to house route 127 which had been surrendered early by Centra. Work was completed on the garage buildings in February 2006. This garage took over the London routes that ran from Godstone with the exception of the 146 and 246 which moved to Orpington.
In April 2014, Go-Ahead London took over this garage (and Orpington) from Metrobus, however the garages are still in the same place.

===Orpington (MB)===

As of August 2020, Orpington garage operates routes 126, 138, 162, 208, 227, 233, 320, 352, 353, 354, 358, 654, 664, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10 and R11.

====History====
Formerly the site of Oak Farm, which was purchased, built upon and used as the base of the independent Orpington and District bus company until its collapse in February 1981, Orpington depot (also known as Green Street Green) was for many years the only garage for all of Metrobus&#x27; London tendered routes since the award of route 61 in 1986. The garage expanded during this period when Metrobus purchased their neighbours, Jasons Coaches. Orpington garage was one of eventually two Metrobus garages included in the sale of Metrobus to the Go-Ahead Group in September 1999, although the Metrobus brand was retained as a separate identity to London General. 

During mid-2005 major reconstruction started at Green Street Green to make improvements and provide an expansion. During these works, a temporary base to house 19 buses was constructed at Sevenoaks next to the base of what was the independent Southlands Travel.

On the evening of 21-22 November 2018, eleven buses were destroyed and several other buses were damaged in a fire that broke out at Orpington garage, requiring the callout of 60 London Fire Brigade firefighters to bring the fire under control. No injuries were reported and Orpington garage maintained a full service on the morning of 22 November, with numerous buses saved by being driven out onto Farnborough Way and surrounding roads.

===Stockwell (SW)===
As of November 2023, Stockwell garage operates routes 11, 44, 77, 87, 88, 118, 155, 170, 333, 337, 424, 690, G1, N11, N44, N87 and N155.

====History====
Stockwell garage opened in 1952 as part of London Transport&#x27;s tram replacement programme after nearly four years of planning and building, with many construction materials short of supply in the aftermath of World War II and problems rehousing residents of the houses that stood on the site. Stockwell garage is a Grade II listed building, and when built was a masterpiece of architectural design incorporating a new roof structure that did not need supports which enabled for a unobstructed parking space. The offices and workshops are on the edges of the garage but do not take up any of the parking spaces.

In the first few days of operation, Stockwell garage ran just 11 buses on route 178 which had moved from Rye Lane (Peckham), but then gained more work from the next stage of the tram replacement programme for which it had been designed, but it was still well short of capacity. More work arrived in late 1953 and early 1954 when routes 77 and 77A (now 87) moved from Victoria garage due to recruitment problems, and the closure of Nunhead garage which increased the peak vehicle requirement of Stockwell to 110 buses. In the early 1970s, the Round London Sightseeing Tours moved to Stockwell.

Between spring 1984 and August 1986, Stockwell operated a varied fleet of double-decker buses on route 170 as part of London Transport&#x27;s Alternative Vehicle Evaluation comparative trial, aimed at finding a new standard double-decker bus type. The vehicles trialled included a pair of MCW Metrobus Mk2s, one of which was built with a Maxwell transmission while the other had a Cummins L10 transmission, three ECW-bodied Leyland Olympians, three Northern Counties-bodied Dennis Dominators and three Alexander-bodied Volvo Ailsas, the latter being the first front-engined buses delivered to London Transport since the last Routemasters were delivered in 1968. The trial ultimately concluded in favour of the ECW-bodied Leyland Olympian, with London Transport taking delivery of a further 260 between 1986 and 1987.

===Sutton (A)===

As of March 2024, Sutton garage operates routes 80 (electric allocation only), 93, 151, 154, 213 and S2.

====History====
Opened by the London General Omnibus Company in January 1924 at cost of £30,000, Sutton garage had a capacity for 100 buses. During its early years, less than half of the garage was put to use, holding only 40 buses by 1926. This would change somewhat by the extension of the Underground to Morden and major house-building projects in the area. 

Between 1945 and 1953, it had an allocation of exactly 100 relaxed-Utility Daimlers (classed as Ds) numbered from D182 - D281. By 1952, the garage had 128 buses allocated, achieved mainly by parking buses in surrounding streets. However, this would soon fall again, to 100 in 1966, 82 in 1976 and 62 in 1987. 

The garage passed to the reborn London General bus company in the run-up to privatisation in 1985. Sutton Garage also partly took control of route 200 at a yard in Colliers Wood (AA) in 1989, after Cityrama withdrew from their contract. Sutton was responsible for providing drivers for the service, whilst Merton garage were contracted to do the maintenance. By 1994, the garage allocation had grown to 85 buses and again to 92 in 2001.

===Waterloo (RA)===

As of July 2023, Waterloo garage operates routes 153 and 214. After the morning services for route SL6, the buses for this route are taken to this garage, where they are cleaned for the evening services. The garage only operates Monday to Friday due to its proximity to residential properties.

====History====
The site was first used as a storage and servicing location for buses attending the Festival of Britain in 1951. The garage opened in the early 1980s as a Red Arrow garage and in the 1990s had an allocation of AEC Routemasters for route 11. In June 2002, the Red Arrow Leyland Nationals were replaced by London&#x27;s first fleet of Mercedes-Benz Citaro articulated buses. Because of the extra space required to stable these, the route 11 Routemasters were transferred to Stockwell garage. In September 2009 the articulated fleet was replaced by Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaros. In 2016, the garage was converted to become fully electric, the first bus depot in Europe to do so. On 29 April 2023, routes 507 and 521 were withdrawn.

==Former garages==
London General previously had four bus garages - Mandela Way (MW), Waterside Way (PL) and Belvedere (BV). Mandela Way and Belvedere were included in the 2009 East Thames Buses purchase. In 2017, these bus garages were closed. Waterside Way (PL) garage was temporarily closed from 25 March 2023 to 28 June 2023, but re-opened only for the commercial bus fleet and the University of Roehampton bus fleet.

===Victoria (GM)===

Victoria bus garage, located on Gillingham Street, opened in March 1940. As well as being used for regular bus services by London Transport and successor London General, serving as the only bus garage in central London, Victoria garage was also used by several express coach operators from across the United Kingdom to store their vehicles between services to and from the nearby Victoria Coach Station.

In May 1993, London General announced it was closing Victoria garage due to the financial impact of the loss of routes at the garage. At the time, Victoria garage operated routes 11, 22, 52, 344, N11 and N19 with a fleet of 65 buses, having recently lost tenders for routes 19 and C2. The garage was eventually demolished for redevelopment in 1999.

<doc id="1113161" wikidata="Q445538" url="?curid=1113161" title="Colin Clive">
<text>Colin Glenn Clive (born Clive-Greig; 20 January 1900 – 25 June 1937) was a British theatre and film actor. He is most famous for his role as Dr. Henry Frankenstein in the 1931 film &quot;Frankenstein&quot; and its 1935 sequel, &quot;Bride of Frankenstein&quot;.

==Early life==
Clive was born in Saint-Malo, France, to an English colonel, Colin Philip Greig, and his wife, Caroline Margaret Lugard Clive. He attended Stonyhurst College and subsequently the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where an injured knee disqualified him from military service and contributed to his becoming a stage actor. He was a member of the Hull Repertory Theatre Company for three years.

Clive created the role of Steve Baker, the white husband of racially mixed Julie LaVerne, in the first London production of &quot;Show Boat&quot;; the production featured Cedric Hardwicke and Paul Robeson. Clive first worked with James Whale in the Savoy Theatre production of &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; and subsequently joined the British community in Hollywood, repeating his stage role in the film version.

==Hollywood==
Clive&#x27;s first screen role, in &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (1930), was also directed by James Whale. Clive played the tormented alcoholic Captain Stanhope, a character that (much like Clive&#x27;s other roles) mirrored his personal life.
He was an in-demand leading man for several major film actresses of the era, including Katharine Hepburn, Bette Davis, Corinne Griffith, and Jean Arthur. He starred as Edward Rochester in the 1934 adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; opposite Virginia Bruce. He was a descendant of Baron Robert Clive and appeared in a starring role in &quot;Clive of India&quot; (1935), a biopic of his ancestor.

Colin Clive, together with Leo G. Carroll, starred in a radio play titled &quot;The Other Place.&quot; It was written by John L. Balderston for the radio program &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; hosted by Rudy Vallee&quot;.&quot; It was aired on 14 November 1935.

In a 1935 interview with Film Weekly, Clive stated that he hated horror films and preferred more serious dramatic roles, only appearing in horror for financial reasons and because his performances were popular with audiences.

Author Ayn Rand wrote Clive a fan letter in 1934 after seeing a stage performance of &quot;Journey’s End&quot;, praising Clive’s performance and character. Clive responded that he was very touched by the letter and would always keep it.

==Personal life==
Clive was married to Jeanne de Casalis in June 1929, though they were estranged for several years before his death.

==Death==
Colin Clive suffered from severe chronic alcoholism and he died from complications of tuberculosis on 25 June 1937 at age 37.

Clive&#x27;s alcoholism was apparent to his co-stars, as he was often seen napping on set and sometimes was so intoxicated that he had to be held upright for over-the-shoulder shots. Clive was tormented by the medical threat of amputation of his long-damaged leg.

Forrest J Ackerman recalled visiting Clive&#x27;s body: &quot;I actually saw him in death, lying in a bed at a mortuary where it was possible for the public to view his body. He looked remarkably as he had when lying in bed in &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot;.&quot; Over 300 mourners turned out. One of the pallbearers was Peter Lorre. His cenotaph is located at Chapel of the Pines Crematory.

<text>The California College of the Arts (CCA) is a private art school in San Francisco, California. It was founded in Berkeley, California in 1907 and moved to a historic estate in Oakland, California in 1922. In 1996, it opened a second campus in San Francisco; in 2022, the Oakland campus was closed and merged into the San Francisco campus. CCA enrolls approximately 1,239 undergraduates and 380 graduate students.

==History==
CCA was founded in 1907 by Frederick Meyer in Berkeley as the School of the California Guild of Arts and Crafts during the height of the Arts and Crafts movement. The Arts and Crafts movement originated in Europe during the late 19th century as a response to the industrial aesthetics of the machine age. Followers of the movement advocated an integrated approach to art, design, and craft. The initial campus was in the &quot;Studio Building&quot; at 2045 Shattuck Avenue, and they had forty three enrolled students.

In 1908 the school was renamed California School of Arts and Crafts. In 1910, the school moved to the site of the former Berkeley High School building at 2119 Allston Way (at Grove Street, now Martin Luther King Way).

The college&#x27;s Oakland campus location was acquired in 1922, when Meyer bought the four-acre James Treadwell estate at Broadway and College Avenue. Two of its buildings are on the National Register of Historic Places. After the San Francisco campus was opened, the Oakland campus continued to house the more traditional, craft based studios like the art glass, jewelry metal arts, printmaking, painting, sculpture and ceramic programs.

In 1936, it became the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC). In 1940 a Master of Fine Arts program was established.

In the 1980s, the college began renting various locations in San Francisco, and in 1996 it opened a campus in the city&#x27;s Design District, converting a former Greyhound maintenance building.

=== 21st century and modern history ===
In 2003, the college changed its name to California College of the Arts, under the leadership of president Michael S. Roth.

In 2016, it was decided to close the Oakland campus and consolidate all activities at the San Francisco campus. The final day of classes at Oakland was May 6, 2022. The college said it will &quot;redevelop the campus with community gathering spaces, affordable housing, office space for arts nonprofits and bike parking while preserving the campus’s cluster of historic buildings and trees.&quot;

Clifton Hall, one of the dormitories at the Oakland campus, was bought by the city of Oakland to use for public housing. Other parts of the Oakland campus remained unused in 2024, with plans to create a mixed-use development with hundreds of residential units.

== List of presidents ==
==Academics==
CCA offers 22 undergraduate and 10 graduate majors. In 2021, CCA unveiled a BFA in Comics. CCA confers the bachelor of fine arts (BFA), bachelor of arts (BA), bachelor of architecture (BArch), master of fine arts (MFA), master of arts (MA), master of architecture (MArch), master of advanced architectural design (MAAD), masters of design (MDes) and master of business administration (MBA) degrees.

The CCA Wattis Institute for Contemporary Arts, located near the San Francisco campus in a facility on Kansas St., is a forum for contemporary culture. In 2013 the Wattis Institute recruited a new director, Anthony Huberman, formerly of Artist&#x27;s Space in New York.

In the U.S. News &amp; World Report rankings for 2020, CCA ranked #10 in the country for graduate fine arts programs, #4 in graphic design, and #6 in ceramics. PayScale lists CCA as the #1 art school in the United States for return on investment and #4 for average alumni salary (bachelor&#x27;s degree). As of 2022, Niche rated CCA with an overall grade of B− (with B− for academics, A+ for diversity, and B− for value), reporting an acceptance rate of 85%, graduation rate of 67%, and average alumni starting salary of $29,400. The average class size is 13 for undergraduate programs and 12 for graduate. The student to faculty ratio is 8:1.

== Accreditation ==
CCA is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD), and the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).

<text>Wilanów () is a district of the city of Warsaw, Poland. It is home to historic Wilanów Palace, the &quot;Polish Versailles,&quot; and second home to various Polish kings. Wilanów is home to many villas and, despite being relatively far away from the city center, the district ranks among the most expensive in Warsaw.

==History==
The first mentions of a settlement in the area can be traced to the 13th century, when a village named &quot;Milanów&quot; was founded by the Benedictine monastery of Płock. In 1338 it became a private property of the Dukes of Mazovia and in 1378 Prince Janusz I of Warsaw gave it to one of his servants. It was he who established the first mansion and a chapel in the village. His descendants adopted the name &quot;Milanowski&quot;, after the name of the village.

In the 17th century the village was bought by the family of Stanisław Leszczyński, who started the construction of a new palace; however, the works were stopped by The Deluge when the forces of Sweden captured the area and plundered it completely. In 1676 the depopulated village was bought by King Jan III Sobieski. By his order, Tylman van Gameren and Augustyn Wincenty Locci erected the new baroque-style palace and St. Anne&#x27;s Church. Initially the palace was named &quot;Villa Nova&quot; (&quot;New Village&quot;), to distinguish it from the nearby village of &quot;Stara Wieś&quot; (&quot;Old Village&quot;). However, soon the name was polonised to Wilanów, similar to the former name Milanów.

Thanks to the proximity of both the kings&#x27; summer residence and the city of Warsaw, Wilanów has for ages been a suburb of Warsaw and a popular holiday spot for Polish magnates. It was also the final point on the historical Royal Road. In the 18th century, the palace became the property of Hetman Adam Mikołaj Sieniawski. His widow, Elżbieta Sieniawska, joined the village with the nearby villages of Kabaty, Powsin and Wolica. After that both the so-called &quot;key&quot; of villages (group of villages run together by a common owner) and the palace changed hands several times, with each new owner changing something in the look of the palace.

In 1863, after the fall of the January Uprising, the Russian authorities introduced a new administrative division, stripping the &quot;key&quot; of the rest of villages and making Wilanów a capital of all the communes located south of it. The area became one of the most important providers of food for ever-growing Warsaw and in 1890 a horse-drawn railway was opened for transport of grain and passengers. The line linking Wilanów with Warsaw&#x27;s Lublin Union Square proved to be a major success and in 1892 the line was extended and started to run steam-drawn trains. Also, new railway stations were built on both ends of the line.

After World War II the palaces in Wilanów, Natolin and Morysin were nationalised by the new communist authorities of Poland. The former was converted into a museum and in one of the palace&#x27;s barracks a Museum of Posters was opened on 4 June 1968. It is probably the only such museum in Europe. In 1951 Wilanów was incorporated into Warsaw. Initially a separate unit of administrative division, in 1976 it was joined with the borough of Mokotów. In 1994 it became a separate unit of administrative division and the following year it became one of the boroughs of Warsaw.

Currently, the surrounding area is home to many expatriates living in Warsaw, as this area is home to many international schools. However, in 2000, the American School of Warsaw moved about 6 km out, to the suburb of Konstancin-Jeziorna.

<text>David Morris Aaronovitch (born 8 July 1954) is an English journalist, television presenter and author. He was a regular columnist for &quot;The Times&quot; and the author of &quot;Paddling to Jerusalem: An Aquatic Tour of Our Small Country&quot; (2000), &quot;Voodoo Histories: the role of Conspiracy Theory in Modern History&quot; (2009) and &quot;Party Animals: My Family and Other Communists&quot; (2016). He won the Orwell Prize for political journalism in 2001, and the &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; award in 2003. He previously wrote for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

== Early life and education==
Aaronovitch is the son of communist intellectual and economist Sam Aaronovitch, and brother of actor Owen Aaronovitch and author and screenwriter Ben Aaronovitch. His parents were atheists whose &quot;faith was Marxism&quot;, according to Aaronovitch, and he is ethnically half Jewish and half Irish. He has written that he was brought up &quot;to react to wealth with a puritanical pout&quot;.

Aaronovitch attended Gospel Oak Primary School until 1965, Holloway County Comprehensive (now Holloway School) until 1968, and William Ellis School from 1968 to 1972, all in London. He studied modern history at Balliol College, Oxford. Aaronovitch completed his education at the Victoria University of Manchester, graduating in 1978 with a 2:1 BA (Hons) in history.

While at Manchester, Aaronovitch was a member of the 1975 &quot;University Challenge&quot; team that lost in the first round after answering most questions with the name of a Marxist (&quot;Trotsky&quot;, &quot;Lenin&quot;, &quot;Karl Marx&quot; or &quot;Che Guevara&quot;). The tactics were a protest against the fact that the University of Oxford and Cambridge University were allowed to enter each of their colleges into the contest as a separate team, even though the colleges were not universities in themselves.

Aaronovitch was initially a Eurocommunist and was active in the National Union of Students (NUS). There he got to know the president at the time, Charles Clarke, who later became Home Secretary. Aaronovitch himself succeeded Trevor Phillips as president of the NUS from 1980 to 1982. He was elected on a Left Alliance ticket.

== Career in journalism ==
Aaranovitch began his media career in the early 1980s as a television researcher and later producer for the ITV programme &quot;Weekend World&quot;. In 1988, he began working at the BBC as founding editor of the political current affairs programme &quot;On the Record&quot;.

He moved to print journalism in 1995, working for &quot;The Independent&quot; and &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; as chief leader writer, television critic, parliamentary sketch writer, and columnist until the end of 2002.

He began contributing to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2003 as a columnist and feature writer. Aaronovitch&#x27;s columns appeared in &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s &quot;G2&quot; section. His desire for his pieces to appear on the main comment pages, according to Peter Wilby, was reportedly vetoed by the section editor, Seumas Milne, although Aaronovitch himself does not know if Milne was involved in the decision. Since June 2005, he has written a regular column for &quot;The Times&quot; that he set to depart from in March 2023 following an announcement he made in January 2023 on Twitter. He has also been a columnist for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;. In addition, Aaronovitch has written for a variety of other major British news and opinion publications, such as the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. In addition, he has written for &quot;New Humanist&quot;, and is an &quot;honorary associate&quot; of its publisher, the Rationalist Association.

Aaronovitch also presents or contributes to radio and television programmes, including the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and BBC News 24. In 2004 he presented &quot;The Norman Way&quot;, a three-part BBC Radio 4 documentary looking at régime change in 1066.

Aaronovitch also hosted the BBC series &quot;The Blair Years&quot; (2007), which examined the prime ministership of Tony Blair. Some journalists were unimpressed with Aaronovitch or dismissed the series.

== Political views ==
Aaronovitch said the case had &quot;been made&quot; for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and that he &quot;reluctantly support[ed] military action,&quot; his &quot;biggest reason&quot; being &quot;the failure of &quot;vigilant containment&quot; to help the people of Iraq.&quot; Since the invasion he maintains the view that it liberated Iraqis, and has played down the significance of Iraq&#x27;s putative weapons of mass destruction. However, he wrote in 2003: &quot;If nothing is eventually found, I – as a supporter of the war – will never believe another thing that I am told by our government, or that of the US ever again. And, more to the point, neither will anyone else. Those weapons had better be there somewhere.&quot; On 7 September 2018, he labelled people who ask him about the article &quot;lamebrains&quot;. He remains a strong supporter of former Prime Minister Tony Blair.

In late 2005, Aaronovitch was co-author, with Oliver Kamm and journalist Francis Wheen, of a complaint to &quot;The Guardian,&quot; after it published an apology to Noam Chomsky for an interview by Emma Brockes, in which she asserted that Chomsky had denied the Srebrenica massacre. A &quot;Guardian&quot; readers&#x27; editor found that the newspaper had misrepresented Chomsky&#x27;s position on the Srebrenica massacre, and that judgement was upheld in May 2006 by an external ombudsman, John Willis.

In his column of 5 September 2013, Aaronovitch criticized the Labour leader Ed Miliband for allegedly providing no alternative to military intervention in Syria, after the use of chemical weapons in the Ghouta attacks of 21 August 2013. For Aaronovitch, &quot;politically [Miliband] is not a presence at all, he is an absence&quot; and &quot;is neither hunter nor prey, he is scavenger. He is a political vulture.&quot;

During 2013, though Aaronovitch had vigorously supported the bombing campaigns against Iraq, Libya, and Syria, he became the chairman of the human rights organisation Index on Censorship, succeeding Jonathan Dimbleby in the role.

In May 2014, he criticised Glenn Greenwald&#x27;s involvement in the Edward Snowden NSA revelations, and characterised Greenwald as &quot;a stilted writer of overlong, dishonest and repetitive polemics.&quot; In response to Aaronovitch&#x27;s article in an interview with Media Lens Greenwald commented on &quot;the hilarious, inane irony of having someone who publicly cheered for the worst political crime of this generation – the attack on Iraq – trying to deny other people “journalist” status on the ground that they seek to “change the world” rather than simply report.&quot;

In August 2014, Aaronovitch was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In 2016, he endorsed the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued membership of the European Union in the 23 June referendum. Aaronovitch later said that Brexit would eventually be reversed as the number of older voters, who typically voted for Britain to leave the European Union, gradually die.

On 1 July 2024, Aaronovitch sparked controversy after tweeting on X, &quot;If I were Biden, I&#x27;d hurry up and have Trump murdered on the basis that he is a threat to America&#x27;s security #SCOTUS&quot;. Donald Trump was the subject of an assassination attempt just 11 days later. Aaronovitch alleged that his call to murder Trump was &quot;plainly a satire&quot;.

==Personal life==

Aaronovitch lives in London with his wife and three daughters.

In 2011, Aaronovitch was the victim of a &quot;medical accident&quot; following routine surgery. He survived sepsis thanks to antibiotics, a treatment that was not available to his grandmother, who died of an infection following an insect bite in 1930. This experience led him to become an advocate for Antibiotic Research UK and the charity&#x27;s work to promote proper antibiotic use and the development of new antibiotics.

<text>Gradisca d&#x27;Isonzo ( or ; ; archaic ) is a town and (municipality) in the Regional decentralization entity of Gorizia in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, north-eastern Italy. The lawyer, linguist, philologist Philippe Sarchi was born in Gradisca d&#x27;Isonzo. It is one of (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==Geography==
The municipality is located in north-eastern Italy on the right bank of the Isonzo River, about southwest of Gorizia. It received town privileges on 14 July 1936. As of a 2011 census, the population of Gradisca is about 6,528.

The town is an important centre of the Friulian culture in the Julian Venetia region.

== History ==
The town&#x27;s name is a Slavic toponym: in archaic Slovene, &quot;gradišče&quot; (cf. gord) was a term indicating a fortified site or a ruin and is a widespread toponym in the Slovene Lands. The strategically-important area on the Isonzo River was probably already settled in Roman times and under the Kingdom of the Lombards, later exposed to the attacks by Hungarian forces on Northern Italy.

The rural settlement of Gradisca is mentioned for the first time in 1176, when it had a mixed population of Slavic and Latin origin. It then belonged to the estate of Farra, held by the Patriarchs of Aquileia. From 1420 onwards their lands were gradually conquered by the Republic of Venice, annexed and incorporated into the Venetian &quot;Domini di Terraferma&quot; in 1473. The Venetians fortified Gradisca as a bastion against Ottoman raids, then part of a massive defence line along the Isonzo River relying on plans designed by Leonardo da Vinci.

During the War of the League of Cambrai against Venice, Gradisca was conquered by Emperor Maximilian I in 1511, and thenceforth it was a Habsburg possession ruled within the County of Gorizia as part of the Inner Austrian lands. In 1615 a Venetian attempt to reconquer it initiated the War of Gradisca. The town was however kept by the Imperial House of Habsburg; in 1647 Emperor Ferdinand III made it the capital of an autonomous County of Gradisca and sold the territory to his confident John Anthony of Eggenberg. The Eggenberg dynasty, formally elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire in 1654, held Gradisca until 1717, enlarging and enriching it constantly as a princely residence.

With the extinction of the Eggenbergs, the county returned to the House of Habsburg, being re-united with the remaining County of Gorizia. The union resulted in the creation of the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca in 1754, which existed until the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. The town remained in the Cisleithanian side after the Compromise of 1867 as head of the district of the same name (GRADISCA), one of the 11 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in the Austrian Littoral province.

During Austrian domination, the town retained its predominantly Italian character. According to the last Austrian census of 1910, 60.0% of the population of the town spoke Italian or Friulian, 13.8% spoke Slovene, and a mere 2.3% spoke German as their first language.

In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, the population of Gradisca fought under Austria-Hungary. In 1921 the town became part of Italy.

== Main sights ==

* Cathedral
* Church of &quot;Santo Spirito&quot;, with an altarpiece by Pompeo Randi.

<doc id="1113185" wikidata="Q1724049" url="?curid=1113185" title="Wolstenholme's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Wolstenholme&#x27;s theorem states that for a prime number &quot;p&quot; ≥ 5, the congruence
:formula_1
holds, where the parentheses denote a binomial coefficient. For example, with &quot;p&quot; = 7, this says that 1716 is one more than a multiple of 343. The theorem was first proved by Joseph Wolstenholme in 1862. In 1819, Charles Babbage showed the same congruence modulo &quot;p&quot;2, which holds for &quot;p&quot; ≥ 3. An equivalent formulation is the congruence
:formula_2
for &quot;p&quot; ≥ 5, which is due to Wilhelm Ljunggren (and, in the special case &quot;b&quot; = 1, to J. W. L. Glaisher) and is inspired by Lucas&#x27;s theorem.

No known composite numbers satisfy Wolstenholme&#x27;s theorem and it is conjectured that there are none (see below). A prime that satisfies the congruence modulo &quot;p&quot;4 is called a [[Wolstenholme prime]] (see below).

As Wolstenholme himself established, his theorem can also be expressed as a pair of congruences for (generalized) harmonic numbers:
:formula_3
:formula_4

since

:formula_5

(Congruences with fractions make sense, provided that the denominators are coprime to the modulus.)
For example, with &quot;p&quot; = 7, the first of these says that the numerator of 49/20 is a multiple of 49, while the second says the numerator of 5369/3600 is a multiple of 7.

== Wolstenholme primes ==
A prime &quot;p&quot; is called a Wolstenholme prime iff the following condition holds:

:formula_6

If &quot;p&quot; is a Wolstenholme prime, then Glaisher&#x27;s theorem holds modulo &quot;p&quot;4. The only known Wolstenholme primes so far are 16843 and 2124679 ; any other Wolstenholme prime must be greater than 1011. This result is consistent with the heuristic argument that the residue modulo &quot;p&quot;4 is a pseudo-random multiple of &quot;p&quot;3. This heuristic predicts that the number of Wolstenholme primes between &quot;K&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is roughly &quot;ln ln N − ln ln K&quot;. The Wolstenholme condition has been checked up to 1011, and the heuristic says that there should be roughly one Wolstenholme prime between 1011 and 1024. A similar heuristic predicts that there are no &quot;doubly Wolstenholme&quot; primes, for which the congruence would hold modulo &quot;p&quot;5.

== A proof of the theorem ==

There is more than one way to prove Wolstenholme&#x27;s theorem. Here is a proof that directly establishes Glaisher&#x27;s version using both combinatorics and algebra.

For the moment let &quot;p&quot; be any prime, and let &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; be any non-negative integers. Then a set &quot;A&quot; with &quot;ap&quot; elements can be divided into &quot;a&quot; rings of length &quot;p&quot;, and the rings can be rotated separately. Thus, the &quot;a&quot;-fold direct sum of the cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot; acts on the set &quot;A&quot;, and by extension it acts on the set of subsets of size &quot;bp&quot;. Every orbit of this group action has &quot;pk&quot; elements, where &quot;k&quot; is the number of incomplete rings, i.e., if there are &quot;k&quot; rings that only partly intersect a subset &quot;B&quot; in the orbit. There are formula_7 orbits of size 1 and there are no orbits of size &quot;p&quot;. Thus we first obtain Babbage&#x27;s theorem
:formula_8
Examining the orbits of size &quot;p&quot;2, we also obtain
:formula_9
Among other consequences, this equation tells us that the case &quot;a&quot; = 2 and &quot;b&quot; = 1 implies the general case of the second form of Wolstenholme&#x27;s theorem.

Switching from combinatorics to algebra, both sides of this congruence are polynomials in &quot;a&quot; for each fixed value of &quot;b&quot;. The congruence therefore holds when &quot;a&quot; is any integer, positive or negative, provided that &quot;b&quot; is a fixed positive integer. In particular, if &quot;a&quot; = −1 and &quot;b&quot; = 1, the congruence becomes
:formula_10
This congruence becomes an equation for formula_11 using the relation
:formula_12
When &quot;p&quot; is odd, the relation is
:formula_13
When &quot;p&quot; ≠ 3, we can divide both sides by 3 to complete the argument.

A similar derivation modulo &quot;p&quot;4 establishes that
:formula_14
for all positive &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; if and only if it holds when &quot;a&quot; = 2 and &quot;b&quot; = 1, i.e., if and only if &quot;p&quot; is a Wolstenholme prime.

== The converse as a conjecture ==
It is conjectured that if

when &quot;k&quot; = 3, then &quot;n&quot; is prime. The conjecture can be understood by considering &quot;k&quot; = 1 and 2 as well as 3. When &quot;k&quot; = 1, Babbage&#x27;s theorem implies that it holds for &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;2 for &quot;p&quot; an odd prime, while Wolstenholme&#x27;s theorem implies that it holds for &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;3 for &quot;p&quot; &gt; 3, and it holds for &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;4 if &quot;p&quot; is a Wolstenholme prime. When &quot;k&quot; = 2, it holds for &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot;2 if &quot;p&quot; is a Wolstenholme prime. These three numbers, 4 = 22, 8 = 23, and 27 = 33 are not held for () with &quot;k&quot; = 1, but all other prime square and prime cube are held for () with &quot;k&quot; = 1. Only 5 other composite values (neither prime square nor prime cube) of &quot;n&quot; are known to hold for () with &quot;k&quot; = 1, they are called Wolstenholme pseudoprimes, they are

:27173, 2001341, 16024189487, 80478114820849201, 20378551049298456998947681, ... 

The first three are not prime powers , the last two are 168434 and 21246794, 16843 and 2124679 are Wolstenholme primes . Besides, with an exception of 168432 and 21246792, no composites are known to hold for () with &quot;k&quot; = 2, much less &quot;k&quot; = 3. Thus the conjecture is considered likely because Wolstenholme&#x27;s congruence seems over-constrained and artificial for composite numbers. Moreover, if the congruence does hold for any particular &quot;n&quot; other than a prime or prime power, and any particular &quot;k&quot;, it does not imply that
:formula_15
The number of Wolstenholme pseudoprimes up to &quot;x&quot; is formula_16, so the sum of reciprocals of those numbers converges. The constant 499712 follows from the existence of only three Wolstenholme pseudoprimes up to 1012. The number of Wolstenholme pseudoprimes up to 1012 should be at least 7 if the sum of its reciprocals diverged, and since this is not satisfied because there are only 3 of them in this range, the counting function of these pseudoprimes is at most formula_17 for some efficiently computable constant &quot;C&quot;; we can take &quot;C&quot; as 499712. The constant in the big O notation is also effectively computable in formula_16.

== Generalizations ==

Leudesdorf has proved that for a positive integer &quot;n&quot; coprime to 6, the following congruence holds:
:formula_19

In 1900, Glaisher showed further that: for prime &quot;p&quot; &gt; 3, 
:formula_20

Where &quot;Bn&quot; is the Bernoulli number.

<doc id="1113197" wikidata="Q973500" url="?curid=1113197" title="Jonathan Freedland">
<text>Jonathan Saul Freedland (born 25 February 1967) is a British journalist who writes a weekly column for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and presents the BBC Radio 4 contemporary history series &quot;The Long View&quot;.

He previously wrote for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; until his resignation in September 2024 along with Hadley Freeman, David Aaronovitch, David Baddiel and others.

Freedland also writes thrillers, mainly under the pseudonym Sam Bourne, and has written a play, &quot;Jews. In Their Own Words&quot;, performed in 2022 at the Royal Court Theatre, London.

== Early life ==
The youngest of three children and the only son of a Jewish couple, biographer and journalist Michael Freedland, and Israeli-born Sara Hocherman, he was educated at University College School, a boys&#x27; independent school in Hampstead, London. As a child, Freedland periodically accompanied his father for broadcasting work. On one occasion, his father was interviewing Eric Morecambe, who comically assumed the 10 year-old Freedland was married. After a gap year working on a kibbutz in Israel with the Labour Zionist Habonim Dror (where Freedland had been mentored by Mark Regev, and Freedland was in turn, a mentor to Sacha Baron Cohen), he studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Wadham College, Oxford. While at Oxford, he was editor of &quot;Cherwell&quot;, the student newspaper.

== Journalism ==
Freedland began his Fleet Street career at the short-lived &quot;Sunday Correspondent&quot;. In 1990 he joined the BBC as a news reporter across radio and television, including for &quot;The World at One&quot; and &quot;Today&quot; on Radio 4. In 1992, he was awarded the Laurence Stern fellowship on &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, serving as a staff writer on national news. He was Washington Correspondent for &quot;The Guardian&quot; from 1993 until 1997, when he returned to London as an editorial writer and columnist.

Between 2002 and 2004, Freedland was an occasional columnist for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and from 2005 to 2007 he wrote a weekly column for the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. He wrote a monthly column for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, until ceasing in September 2024 following its publication of news reports said to have been fabricated. He has also been published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;The New Republic&quot;.

Freedland was named &quot;Columnist of the Year&quot; in the 2002 &quot;What the Papers Say&quot; awards and in 2008 was awarded the David Watt Prize for Journalism, in recognition of his essay &quot;Bush&#x27;s Amazing Achievement&quot;, published in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;. Nominated on seven occasions, Freedland was awarded a special Orwell Prize in May 2014 for his journalism. In 2016, he won the &quot;Commentariat of the Year&quot; prize at the Comment Awards.

Freedland was executive editor of the opinion section of &quot;The Guardian&quot; from May 2014 till early 2016 and continues to write a Saturday column for it.

In November 2019, Freedland apologised for making a &quot;very bad error&quot; in falsely reporting that a shortlisted Labour prospective parliamentary candidate had been fined for making antisemitic remarks on Facebook. He attributed the mistaken identification by confusing two lawyers with the same name to a &quot;previously reliable Labour source&quot; whose information he had &quot;passed on too hastily&quot;.

== Author ==
Freedland has published twelve books: three non-fiction works under his own name and nine novels, eight of them under the pseudonym Sam Bourne.

&quot;Bring Home the Revolution: The case for a British Republic&quot; (1998), Freedland&#x27;s first book, argued that Britain should reclaim the revolutionary ideals it exported to America in the 18th century, and undergo a constitutional and cultural overhaul. The book won a W. Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction and was later adapted into a two-part series for BBC Television.

&quot;Jacob&#x27;s Gift&quot; (2005) is a memoir recounting the lives of three generations of his own Jewish family as well as exploring wider questions of identity and belonging. In 2008, he broadcast a two-part series for BBC Radio 4 – &quot;British Jews and the Dream of Zion&quot; – as well as two TV documentaries for BBC Four: &quot;How to be a Good President&quot; and &quot;President Hollywood&quot;.

&quot;The Righteous Men&quot; (2006), is a religious thriller published under the Bourne pen name. It is about a news reporter whose life is disrupted when his wife is kidnapped while he is reporting a story of a militia man found dead. As more murders of &#x27;righteous men&#x27; happen across the globe, Will soon finds himself in the middle of a plot to bring about nothing less than Judgement Day.
The book was followed by another Sam Bourne title, &quot;The Last Testament&quot; (2007), set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process. It draws on the author&#x27;s experiences in that region as a reporter for over twenty years, and a &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper sponsored dialogue which was influential in the 2003 Geneva Accords. The central character finds herself involved in a mix of the modern political situation and ancient revelations. &quot;The Final Reckoning&quot; (2008), was based on the true story of the Avengers: a group of Holocaust survivors who sought revenge against their Nazi persecutors, and just missed the peak of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; best-seller list. Just before &quot;The Chosen One&quot; (2010), the fourth thriller by Sam Bourne was published in the UK, &quot;The Bookseller&quot; reported in April 2010 that HarperCollins had signed Freedland for three more Bourne books.

HarperCollins published &quot;Pantheon&quot; in July 2012. Freedland&#x27;s sixth novel entitled &quot;The 3rd Woman&quot;, published by HarperCollins in 2015 under his own name. His sixth Bourne novel, &quot;To Kill a President,&quot; was published by HarperCollins on 4 July 2017. The seventh novel under the Sam Bourne pseudonym, &quot;To Kill the Truth&quot;, was published in February 2019, and the eighth &quot;To Kill a Man,&quot; came out in March 2020.

He is the author of &quot;The Escape Artist: The Man Who Broke Out of Auschwitz to Warn the World,&quot; a biography of Rudolf Vrba, who participated in the first escape by Jews from the Auschwitz concentration camp. It reached number two in the Sunday Times bestsellers list and was shortlisted for the Baillie Gifford Prize of 2022, the Rathbones Folio Prize, and the Waterstones Book of the Year. In the US it won the National Jewish Book Award in both the Biography and Holocaust categories.

Freedland is also the writer of a stage play &quot;Jews. In Their Own Words.&quot; performed at the Royal Court Theatre and directed by Vicky Featherstone in 2022.

In 2024, Freedland wrote a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;King Winter&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, which was inspired by an unpublished children&#x27;s short story by fellow Jewish writer Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz. Boschwitz left behind the manuscript of &quot;King Winter&#x27;s Birthday: A Fairy Tale&quot;, dreaming of the plot while held on the Isle of Man; the unpublished handwritten work, along with illustrations by Ulrich&#x27;s mother, had lain undisturbed in a New York archive for eighty years. British publisher &quot;Pushkin Press&quot; discovered Boschwitz&#x27;s story and commissioned Freedland to translate it into English. On November 14, 2024, &quot;Pushkin Press&quot; published Freedland&#x27;s translation of Boschwitz&#x27;s manuscript as &quot;King Winter&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, with illustrations by British artist Emily Sutton.

== Views ==
=== Israel, Zionism and antisemitism ===
A leading liberal Zionist in the UK, he wrote in 2012 that he uses the word &quot;Zionism&quot; infrequently, as the word has been misunderstood and has become defined as right-wing. On the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, he believed that military action perpetuates conflict and called for negotiations to end the cycles of violence. He defends Israel&#x27;s right to exist, but hopes that Israel will recognise the &quot;high price&quot; paid by Palestinians.

While Jeremy Corbyn was its leader, Freedland accused the Labour Party in the UK of being in denial on the issue of antisemitism, but Freedland approves of Keir Starmer&#x27;s approach to the issue. He has urged the left to treat Jews &quot;the same way you&#x27;d treat any other minority&quot;. He has also commented on the antisemitic expressions of Palestinians with whom Corbyn has associated and expressed the view that many of the Labour Party&#x27;s new members were hostile to Jews. Freedland&#x27;s Labour antisemitism scoop has been criticised for demonising dissent.

Beginning in 2021, Freedland has cohosted a Podcast called &quot;Unholy: Two Jews on the News&quot; with Israeli news anchor and journalist Yonit Levi.

Jewish heritage

Freedland is a supporter of projects that seek to preserve Jewish identity and heritage. He has frequently written about the importance of both his faith and his cultural heritage. He has also been active in campaigns to save British Jewish heritage.

== Personal life ==
Freedland is married to Sarah Peters, a radio and podcast producer. They have two sons, Jacob and Sam, and conform to Masorti Judaism. He is a governor of Simon Marks Jewish Primary School in Stamford Hill.

<doc id="1113199" wikidata="Q11417093" url="?curid=1113199" title="Instruction scheduling">
<text>In computer science, instruction scheduling is a compiler optimization used to improve instruction-level parallelism, which improves performance on machines with instruction pipelines. Put more simply, it tries to do the following without changing the meaning of the code:

* Avoid pipeline stalls by rearranging the order of instructions.
* Avoid illegal or semantically ambiguous operations (typically involving subtle instruction pipeline timing issues or non-interlocked resources).
The pipeline stalls can be caused by structural hazards (processor resource limit), data hazards (output of one instruction needed by another instruction) and control hazards (branching).

== Data hazards ==
Instruction scheduling is typically done on a single basic block. In order to determine whether rearranging the block&#x27;s instructions in a certain way preserves the behavior of that block, we need the concept of a &quot;data dependency&quot;. There are three types of dependencies, which also happen to be the three data hazards:
# Read after Write (RAW or &quot;True&quot;): Instruction 1 writes a value used later by Instruction 2. Instruction 1 must come first, or Instruction 2 will read the old value instead of the new.
# Write after Read (WAR or &quot;Anti&quot;): Instruction 1 reads a location that is later overwritten by Instruction 2. Instruction 1 must come first, or it will read the new value instead of the old.
# Write after Write (WAW or &quot;Output&quot;): Two instructions both write the same location. They must occur in their original order.

Technically, there is a fourth type, Read after Read (RAR or &quot;Input&quot;): Both instructions read the same location. Input dependence does not constrain the execution order of two statements, but it is useful in scalar replacement of array elements.

To make sure we respect the three types of dependencies, we construct a dependency graph, which is a directed graph where each vertex is an instruction and there is an edge from I1 to I2 if I1 must come before I2 due to a dependency. If loop-carried dependencies are left out, the dependency graph is a directed acyclic graph. Then, any topological sort of this graph is a valid instruction schedule. The edges of the graph are usually labelled with the &quot;latency&quot; of the dependence. This is the number of clock cycles that needs to elapse before the pipeline can proceed with the target instruction without stalling.

== Algorithms ==

The simplest algorithm to find a topological sort is frequently used and is known as list scheduling. Conceptually, it repeatedly selects a source of the dependency graph, appends it to the current instruction schedule and removes it from the graph. This may cause other vertices to be sources, which will then also be considered for scheduling. The algorithm terminates if the graph is empty.

To arrive at a good schedule, stalls should be prevented. This is determined by the choice of the next instruction to be scheduled. A number of heuristics are in common use:

* The processor resources used by the already scheduled instructions are recorded. If a candidate uses a resource that is occupied, its priority will drop.
* If a candidate is scheduled closer to its predecessors than the associated latency, its priority will drop.
* If a candidate lies on the critical path of the graph, its priority will rise. This heuristic provides some form of look-ahead in an otherwise local decision process.
* If choosing a candidate will create many new sources, its priority will rise. This heuristic tends to generate more freedom for the scheduler.

== Phase order ==
Instruction scheduling may be done either before or after register allocation or both before and after it. The advantage of doing it before register allocation is that this results in maximum parallelism. The disadvantage of doing it before register allocation is that this can result in the register allocator needing to use a number of registers exceeding those available. This will cause spill/fill code to be introduced, which will reduce the performance of the section of code in question.

If the architecture being scheduled has instruction sequences that have potentially illegal combinations (due to a lack of instruction interlocks), the instructions must be scheduled after register allocation. This second scheduling pass will also improve the placement of the spill/fill code.

If scheduling is only done after register allocation, then there will be false dependencies introduced by the register allocation that will limit the amount of instruction motion possible by the scheduler.

== Types ==
There are several types of instruction scheduling:
#&quot;Local&quot; (&quot;basic block&quot;) &quot;scheduling&quot;: instructions can&#x27;t move across basic block boundaries.
#&quot;Global scheduling&quot;: instructions can move across basic block boundaries. 
#&quot;Modulo scheduling&quot;: an algorithm for generating software pipelining, which is a way of increasing instruction level parallelism by interleaving different iterations of an inner loop.
#&quot;Trace scheduling&quot;: the first practical approach for global scheduling, trace scheduling tries to optimize the control flow path that is executed most often. 
#&quot;Superblock scheduling&quot;: a simplified form of trace scheduling which does not attempt to merge control flow paths at trace &quot;side entrances&quot;. Instead, code can be implemented by more than one schedule, vastly simplifying the code generator.

== Compiler examples ==
The GNU Compiler Collection is one compiler known to perform instruction scheduling, using the (both instruction set and scheduling) or (only scheduling) flags. It uses descriptions of instruction latencies and what instructions can be run in parallel (or equivalently, which &quot;port&quot; each use) for each microarchitecture to perform the task. This feature is available to almost all architectures that GCC supports.

Until version 12.0.0, the instruction scheduling in LLVM/Clang could only accept a (called in LLVM parlance) switch for both instruction set and scheduling. Version 12 adds support for () for x86 only.

Sources of information on latency and port usage include:
* GCC and LLVM;
* Agner Fog, who compiles extensive data for the x86 architecture;
* InstLatx64, which uses AIDA64 to collect data on x86 CPUs.

LLVM&#x27;s should be usable on all machines, especially to gather information on non-x86 ones.

<doc id="1113202" wikidata="Q4710046" url="?curid=1113202" title="Albert Driedger">
<text>Albert Driedger (January 18, 1936 – July 18, 2011) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1977 to 1999, and a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1997.

Driedger was born in Steinbach, Manitoba, and was educated at the University of Manitoba. He returned to the Steinbach area after graduation, and worked as a real estate broker and farmer. In 1958, Driedger married Mary Penner. Between 1967 and 1972, he served as reeve of the municipality of Hanover. He was also a director of the Elim Mennonite Church in Grunthal, Manitoba. On July 15, 1970, his frog Georges won the &quot;First International Frog Jumping Championship&quot; in St. Pierre-Jolys, Manitoba, as part of a series of festivities surrounding a royal visit.

Driedger was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1977 as a Progressive Conservative, defeating incumbent New Democrat Steve Derewianchuk by about 1000 votes in the rural southeastern riding of Emerson. In his first term, he served as a backbench MLA supporting the Progressive Conservative government of Sterling Lyon.

The NDP defeated Lyon&#x27;s government in the 1981 provincial election, although Driedger was able to retain Emerson by 356 votes over his NDP challenger Paul Dupuis. He was re-elected by a greater majority in the 1986 election, which the NDP won by a narrow margin.

In 1988, disgruntled NDP backbencher Jim Walding brought down his government and forced a new election. Driedger was again re-elected without difficulty, and was appointed Minister of Government Services and Minister of Highways and Transportation on May 9, 1988.

Following the redistribution of provincial electoral districts for the 1990 election, Driedger ran in the riding of Steinbach; he once again won without any difficulty. He lost his position as government services minister on February 5, 1991, and on September 10, 1993, was transferred from highways and transportation to the Ministry of Natural Resources. Once again, he experienced no difficulties in the 1995 provincial election. He supported Jean Charest&#x27;s bid to lead the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1993 (&quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot;, 12 June 1993). Driedger was dropped from cabinet on January 6, 1997, and did not seek re-election in 1999.

After leaving politics, he was chairman of the board for the Menno Home for the Aged in Grunthal. Driedger died on July 18, 2011, at the age of 75, days after suffering a stroke.

<text>Hot Streets is the tenth studio album (and twelfth overall album) by the American rock band Chicago, released on October 2, 1978, by Columbia Records. This was the band&#x27;s first album with all-new material released since their second that did not have a numbered title. It was also the first album not to feature original guitarist/vocalist and group founder Terry Kath, who died from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound in January 1978. He was replaced by Donnie Dacus on this album.

==Background==
Having worked with James William Guercio since their 1969 debut, Chicago decided to part ways with the producer following the release of &quot;Chicago XI&quot; in 1977. Another major change for the group was the death of guitarist/vocalist/group founder Terry Kath in January 1978, who accidentally shot himself at a roadie&#x27;s house while playing with a gun. The members of the band were devastated by his death and considered breaking up. After the initial shock waned, the group decided they still had something to offer musically and carried on.

Phil Ramone, who had mixed some of their earlier albums, was called upon to co-produce their new effort. But before Chicago could begin recording, they had to contend with the difficult process of finding a new guitarist. Accomplished guitarist Donnie Dacus was chosen, bringing his own distinctive style to the group&#x27;s music. Prior to joining Chicago, Dacus had worked with both Roger McGuinn and Stephen Stills.

Recording sessions took place both in Miami and Los Angeles that spring, after years of working at Guercio&#x27;s Caribou Ranch in Colorado. By the end of the sessions, the band felt as though they were still in a strong musical position even after the loss of Kath. Some of the tracks featured the Bee Gees and their keyboardist, Blue Weaver, who were recording the album &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot; next door at the same Miami studio. The Gibb brothers added vocals to the song &quot;Little Miss Lovin&#x27;&quot; while Weaver added synthesized strings to &quot;No Tell Lover&quot; and &quot;Show Me The Way&quot;. In turn, Chicago&#x27;s horn section played on &quot;Spirits Having Flown&quot;, most notably on the hit single &quot;Too Much Heaven&quot;.

To mark their new beginning, the band broke with tradition by giving their album a title, rather than a number. Having chosen the title &quot;Hot Streets&quot;, the album cover featured a picture of the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff) rather than just the group logo. Because a later marketing survey noted that consumers expected to see the logo on the cover, Chicago&#x27;s logo returned in the form of a high-rise building for the follow-up album, &quot;Chicago 13&quot;.

The album was released in October 1978, preceded by a release of the lead single &quot;Alive Again&quot;. &quot;Hot Streets&quot; was another hit for the group, who had been concerned that the public might not accept them without Kath. Although the album went platinum, and Chicago scored a second top-twenty hit with &quot;No Tell Lover&quot;, &quot;Hot Streets&quot; was the first Chicago album since their debut that failed to reach the US Top 10; fittingly, the band&#x27;s twelfth album peaked at #12.

Following the release of &quot;Chicago 13&quot; and at the end of the Christmas 1979 tour, Dacus would be released from the group, bringing his short tenure with Chicago to an abrupt end.

In 2003, &quot;Hot Streets&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with an alternate version of Lamm&#x27;s &quot;Love Was New&quot; sung by Dacus as a bonus track.

==Critical reception==

Although unsuccessful commercially, &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the single &quot;Gone Long Gone&quot; that the guitar introduction sounds like George Harrison and said that it has &quot;slick harmonies and smooth production&quot; and praised &quot;Donnie Dacus&#x27; guitar shadings.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; said it is &quot;a soft, mid-tempo rocker propelled by Peter Cetera&#x27;s familiar vocals and some compelling lofty guitar work.&quot;

<text>Bedazzled is a 2000 fantasy romantic comedy film directed by Harold Ramis and starring Brendan Fraser and Elizabeth Hurley. It is a remake of the 1967 British film of the same name, written by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, itself a comic retelling of the Faust legend.

==Plot==
The Devil runs a computer simulation to analyze souls to determine individual weaknesses to exploit. The program settles on Elliot Richards, a sweet, geeky, over-zealous man working a dead-end job in a San Francisco computer company. He has no friends and his co-workers avoid him. He has a crush on colleague Alison Gardner, but lacks the courage to ask her out. After Elliot is ditched by his co-workers at a bar while trying to talk to Alison, he says he would give anything for Alison to be with him. The Devil, in the form of a charming and beautiful woman, overhears him and offers to give Elliot seven wishes in exchange for his soul.

As a test, Elliot wishes for a Big Mac and a large Coke. The Devil takes him to McDonald&#x27;s and places the order. Elliot has to pay for it, because the Devil left her purse in the Underworld. After taking Elliot to her office, based at a nightclub in Oakland, the Devil convinces Elliot to sign her contract, and delivers further wishes. Each wish has Elliot living them out with Alison and his co-workers in surrogate roles. However, the Devil always spoils his wishes by adding something he does not expect or want.

After going through five wishes, Elliot is arrested after confessing his story to a priest who believed he was drunk. The Devil, dressed as a police officer, throws him in a cell, telling him that she likes him, and it would not hurt to have her as a friend. Elliot&#x27;s friendly cellmate tells him that he cannot sell his soul as it belongs to God, and although the Devil may try to confuse him, in the end he will realize who he truly is, and what his purpose is. Elliot questions the man as to his identity, but the response is simply &quot;a really good friend&quot;.

Elliot asks the Devil to cancel their contract. When the Devil refuses, Elliot states he will not use his final wish. The Devil teleports them to Hell. When the Devil pushes him to make a final wish, Elliot wishes that Alison could have a happy life —with or without him. The Devil sighs and Elliot falls into the depths of Hell. He wakes up on a marble staircase, wondering if it is Heaven. The Devil tells him that a provision in the contract&#x27;s fine print states that a selfless wish voids the contract. Elliot admits that despite her manipulation of him he has come to like the Devil and regards her as a friend. She advises that Heaven and Hell can be found on Earth being up to humans to choose. Elliot asks Alison out, but discovers she is already dating another man. He continues with his life, with a better understanding of who he is.

Elliot is confronted by Bob, one of his co-workers, who ridicules Elliot at the encouragement of his co-workers. Elliot grabs a terrified Bob by the shirt, but lets go, simply saying, &quot;Nice talking to you.&quot; At home, he meets a new neighbor, Nicole, whose looks resemble Alison&#x27;s but whose personality, interests and fashion sense are much closer to his. He offers to help her unpack and they begin a relationship. While the two walk along a boulevard, the Devil and Elliot&#x27;s cellmate, both dressed in white, are playing chess. The Devil&#x27;s computer program lists Nicole and Elliot&#x27;s foibles, which they tolerate.

==Production==
In April 1997, it was reported that Harold Ramis would write, direct, and co-produce a remake of the 1967 film &quot;Bedazzled&quot; for 20th Century Fox with the approval of the original film&#x27;s director Stanley Donen, who jointly owned the rights with Fox. In January 1998, Larry Gelbart joined to co-write the script, which, unlike the original film, would feature a female Devil. In November 1999, it was reported that Brendan Fraser dropped out of &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; to play the lead role in &quot;Bedazzled&quot; for $10 million, with Fox enthusiastic on working with Fraser again after &quot;Monkeybone&quot;. In January 2000, Elizabeth Hurley and Frances O&#x27;Connor joined the film as co-stars.

==Release==
===Home media===
In the United States, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; was released on DVD and VHS on March 13, 2001 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. Anchor Bay Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray on May 28, 2013 under license from Fox, and reissued the film on DVD that same day.

In Germany, Capelight Pictures released the film on Blu-Ray as a standalone release on May 14, 2014; on May 21 that year, it was rereleased as a double pack with the original 1967 film.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film did reasonably well at the box office. It topped British box office sales when it debuted in the UK during the weekend of 10 November 2000, and finished at #2 on its American opening weekend behind the surprise smash hit &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;.

===Critical response===
The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hurley&#x27;s performance was praised, but her attendance of its premiere was met with backlash from the Screen Actors Guild because it occurred during a strike it was holding. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 117 reviews, with an average of 5.5/10. The site&#x27;s general consensus states: &quot;Though it has its funny moments, this remake is essentially a one joke movie with too many flat plots, and not a patch on the superior original.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 49 out of 100 based on reviews from 34 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, disappointedly, that &quot;&#x27;Bedazzled&#x27; recycled is not the finest hour for Fraser or Hurley—though Fraser, Elliot Richards in this movie, comes closer. It isn&#x27;t Ramis&#x27; finest hour either—though he&#x27;s one American moviemaker who excels at concept comedies, as he&#x27;s proved in &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;, and the best parts of the crude and lewd &quot;Caddyshack.&quot; &quot;Bedazzled,&quot; one of the best comic premises ever, should have been duck soup to him.&quot; Wilmington&#x27;s rival, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;″ Roger Ebert, commented that &quot;the new movie has been directed by Harold Ramis from a screenplay that uses the 1967 film more as inspiration than source. It is lacking in wickedness. It doesn&#x27;t smack its lips when it&#x27;s naughty. When its hero sells his soul to the devil, what results isn&#x27;t diabolical effrontery, but a series of contract negotiations and consumer complaints. This is twice in two weeks (after the Winona Ryder exorcism movie &quot;Lost Souls&quot;) that Satan loses on points.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Kenneth Turan stated that &quot;as written by Larry Gelbart, director Harold Ramis and Peter Tolan, this &#x27;Bedazzled,&#x27; though amusing from moment to moment, is erratic, unfocused and uncertain where it&#x27;s going. And whenever it gets too insecure about itself, the film falls back, in classic the-devil-made-me-do-it Hollywood fashion, on explosions, gunfights, helicopter stunts, car crashes and computer-generated effects. What should be a drawing-room comedy ends with moments best left to &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="1113206" wikidata="Q4718568" url="?curid=1113206" title="Alexander Chancellor">
<text>Alexander Surtees Chancellor, CBE (4 January 1940 – 28 January 2017) was a British journalist and editor. He was the editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot; from 1975 to 1984.

== Background ==
Alexander Chancellor was born in 1940 in Dane End, Hertfordshire, of four children born to journalist Christopher Chancellor and his wife, Sylvia (née Paget) Chancellor. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity Hall, Cambridge.

==Career==
Chancellor began his career as a journalist with Reuters, where his father had worked. He was a correspondent in France and Italy. In 1975, he returned to Britain to become the editor of the conservative &quot;Spectator&quot;. He inherited a publication in deep financial crisis, and responded by hiring numerous new contributors, ranging from Auberon Waugh to Christopher Hitchens to Jennifer Paterson, and changing the publication&#x27;s tone, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; later writing that the magazine went &quot;from a bilious and parochial Tory weekly into an entertaining magazine&quot;. Within his first few years as editor, circulation had nearly doubled, from 12,000 to 20,000. In 1981, the magazine was sold, and Chancellor left by the middle of the decade. 

In 1986, after a spell as deputy editor of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, he became the first Washington correspondent of the newly-launched quality broadsheet, &quot;The Independent,&quot; and subsequently launched and edited the paper&#x27;s first Saturday magazine. In 1993, he spent a year in the United States working as an editor at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, where he oversaw the &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; section. During this time, Chancellor reportedly informed his colleagues he had uncovered a great story &quot;a gigantic Christmas tree outside Rockefeller Center&quot;.

This experience was the basis of a memoir, &quot;Some Times in America&quot;, which both satirised the ordeal and recorded his deep affection for New York and the United States. It was published in 2000. In 1995, Chancellor returned to &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; to help launch a magazine supplement. In 1996, he began writing a column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, where he remained until January 2012. Two months later, he began to contribute to &quot;The Spectator&quot; again, with a column entitled &quot;Long Life&quot;.

In June 2014, Chancellor became editor of &quot;The Oldie&quot; magazine in succession to Richard Ingrams.

==Personal life==
Chancellor lived in Northamptonshire. In 1964, he married Susanna Debenham, and they had two daughters: model Cecilia Chancellor, and Eliza Chancellor, who married the writer Alexander Waugh, the son of Auberon Waugh. Chancellor was the grandson of Sir John Chancellor, the first Governor of Southern Rhodesia, and was the uncle of British actress Anna Chancellor. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to journalism.

Chancellor died at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London on 28 January 2017, aged 77. His final column for &quot;The Spectator&quot; was published on the day he died.

<text>The Fore River is a short horn-shaped estuary, approximately long, separating Portland and South Portland in Maine in the United States. Many of the port facilities of the Portland harbor are along the estuary, which is formed just southwest of Portland by the confluence of several creeks. The estuary was initially known as Levett&#x27;s River, so named by the first English settler of the Casco Bay region, Capt. Christopher Levett. But shortly afterwards, the estuary came to have the name by which it is known today.

The Stroudwater River flows into the Fore River estuary. The Cumberland and Oxford Canal connected the estuary with Sebago Lake via the Stroudwater River from 1832 through 1870. The estuary enters Casco Bay on the southeast edge of Portland, a short distance after Long Creek flows into it. Like other coastal areas along the Gulf of Maine, it experiences moderately high tides, and thus the water level in the estuary and the harbor varies greatly throughout the day, leaving mud flats at low tide. It is spanned by the Pan Am Railways bridge and three highway bridges: the Casco Bay Bridge which connects Portland to South Portland, Veterans Memorial Bridge which carries Route 1, and a causeway which carries I-295.

<text>Thirroul () is a northern seaside suburb of the city of Wollongong, Australia. Situated between Austinmer and Bulli, it is approximately 13 kilometres north of Wollongong, and 73 km south of Sydney. It lies between the Pacific Ocean and a section of the Illawarra escarpment known as Lady Fuller Park, adjacent to Bulli Pass Scenic Reserve.

==Name==
After European settlement had grown in the 1860s, the town was first called North Bulli, until it was renamed Robbinsville in 1880 after a local landowner, Frederick Robbins. 

In 1887 the Railways Department opened a railway station in the town, and in 1892 officially adopted the name Thirroul. The source for this suggestion was probably Archibald Campbell, then owner and editor of the &quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot;, who was interested in Indigenous languages. His original manuscript transcription of the Aboriginal word for the cabbage tree palm which flourished in the area was &quot;Dthirrawell&quot;. In 1892, Port Kembla Aboriginal elder William Sadler said that the word &quot;Thirroul&quot; was meaningless. The proper term must be, he claimed, &quot;throon&quot;, referring to the bush leeches collected near the town. A local historian, Joseph Davis, cleared up the confusion in 1994, revealing that Campbell&#x27;s original manuscript transliteration of the term, &quot;Dthirrawell&quot; was almost illegible, and a clerk had misread and mistranscribed it as &quot;Thirroul&quot;.

==History==

Before European settlement, the land on which Thirroul is located had been occupied for at least 20,000 years by a subgroup of the Dharawal (or Tharawal) people. The Wodiwodi people spoke a dialect of Tharawal. 

Cabbage-tree palms were once plentiful in the area and early white settlers harvested them to make strong fence posts. Stands of these trees are still visible on either side of Bulli Pass.

The first Europeans to settle in the area were loggers, who from around 1812 cut down some of many of the cedars in the area and shipped them to Sydney. People started to settle there in the 1860s, mostly on the hilly area as the coast was flood-prone. 

Occupations consisted of farming, cedar logging, whaling and fruit growing and eventually mining when the Bulli Mine was opened in 1859 and the Bulli Jetty which shipped the coal from the mine opened in 1863. The township was known as North Bulli until February 1880 when the name of Robbinsville was chosen. The new name was decided upon at a meeting of ten men (including Frederick Robbins) in George&#x27;s Whitford&#x27;s &quot;big new House&quot; (located on the site of today&#x27;s Ryans Hotel) in 1880. One suggestion for a name for the place was &quot;Mudmire&quot; but somehow Robbins convinced the others to call the town after himself. It only had a total population of 490 in 1891.

In 1888 the rail link with Sydney was finished. Early construction workers on the railway caused a population increase, and the eastern side of the town progressed rapidly. The Thirroul Locomotive Depot opened in 1917. It closed in 1965 and only the barracks for the accommodation of the railway crews remain. The Railway Institute Hall (opened in 1920) where workers once studied has been classified as a heritage building. The construction of the rail link also created an increase in tourism for Thirroul. It became a popular family seaside holiday destination with boarding houses and holiday cottages in demand.

Two known early residents include Samuel McCauley and Frederick Robbins. McCauley was one of the oldest residents of the Illawarra district when he died in June 1899 in Thirroul. A street in Thirroul has been named McCauley street. Robbins was a prominent resident who gave his name to the township of North Bulli as it was then called. He was made the first postmaster of Robbinsville in 1888 after, along with other residents, lobbying the government to supply a post office and railway platform.

In 1898 the &quot;Amy&quot; was shipwrecked on the rocks at the southern end of Thirroul beach. All of its crew died. A memorial plaque to the Amy and her crew is located in the Thirroul Beach Park.

Coal mining operations began at the start of the 20th century and miners needed residences, though logging had been occurring before for some time.
The world-famous English author, D. H. Lawrence visited Thirroul in 1922 and wrote the novel &quot;Kangaroo&quot; about Australian fringe politics after the First World War whilst there. Overlooking the Pacific Ocean, his house Wyewurk is the earliest Australian bungalow to show the influence of the Californian Bungalow style of architecture. He gave this description of the town: &quot;... The town trailed down from the foot of the mountain towards the railway, a huddle of grey and red painted iron roofs. Then over the rail line towards the sea, it began again in a spasmodic fashion ... There were wide unmade roads running straight as to go nowhere, with little bungalow homes ... Then quite near the inland, rose a great black wall of mountain or cliff ...&quot;.

A park and a monument (dedicated 21 November 1998) commemorate D H Lawrence&#x27;s time at Thirroul, located on the same street as the house he stayed in.

The book &quot;D.H. Lawrence at Thirroul&quot; (1989), by Thirroul resident Joseph Davis, questioned many of the assumptions made by Robert Darroch in his 1981 work entitled &quot;D.H. Lawrence in Australia&quot;. The Cambridge edition of D.H. Lawrence&#x27;s novel &quot;Kangaroo&quot; tended to accept the views of Davis rather than those of Darroch.

Michael Bialoguski, later to become a prominent player in the Petrov Affair (1954) and later still an orchestral conductor in the UK and Europe, had a medical practice in Thirroul in the late 1940s. The artist Brett Whiteley died from a heroin overdose in the Beachside Motel in Thirroul on 15 June 1992, aged 53.

The Thirroul Village Committee (TVC) was formed in 1983 because, in the words of Don Gray, &quot;the town was looking rather tatty&quot; and something needed to be done. Don was the founding chairperson and Lynne Jones, the founding Secretary. In 1983 the population of less than 5,000 qualified Thirroul as a village. In 1993 the TVC won the Basil Ryan gold award at the Rise &amp; Shine Awards presentation for improved streetscapes. The Thirroul Seaside and Arts Festival, which is a successful community event, was the idea of Don Gray. The first festival was run in 1993. Lynne Jones organised the Festival for many years, building to the point where it was handed over to the Lions Club.

Another community event was &quot;the Growing Green Kids Festival&#x27; – a not-for-profit event which was the brain-child of resident Cate Wilson (1948–2012). Cate was also President of the Thirroul Action Group (TAG) - an environmental group which has functioned for around 30 years. Residents concerned about health risks picketed against the Telstra phone tower in 1997. Storms and floods severely affected the Thirroul area in August 1998.

In August 2007, Thirroul&#x27;s CBD and beach was declared an alcohol-free zone as a council initiative to prevent public drinking on streets and footpaths within the designated area.

In 2011 Thirroul resident Don Gray released a self-published book of his memories called &quot;My Thirroul&quot; illustrated by local artist, Christine Hill. A children&#x27;s playground was opened by Wollongong Council with a plaque carrying their names on 4 July 2012. Some of the artwork evokes Gray&#x27;s memories of an elephant stuck in the former Thirroul Beach lagoon on the current site of the playground – a story he recalled (and which Christine Hill illustrated) in his book. Gray died on 28 April 2013, aged 93 (&quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot;, 30 April 2013).
===Anita&#x27;s Theatre===

King&#x27;s Theatre, located at 264-270 Lawrence Hargrave Drive, was designed by renowned theatre architects Kaberry and Chard, and built for Wollongong Theatres in 1925. Officially opened on 22 October 1925, it accommodated an audience of 1,560, with 1,202 stalls seats, 248 circle seats, and four boxes along the side walls. The theatre was in continuous operation as a cinema until 1965 or 1966.

In April 1968, after all seating had been removed and a flat concrete floor laid, the building was converted into a roller-skating rink and opened as Skateland. It remained open as such until the mid-1990s.

In 2003, businessman John Comelli purchased the derelict building, and undertook extensive refurbishment to convert it back into a theatre. In 2007 it reopened as Anita&#x27;s Theatre, to commemorate Comelli&#x27;s deceased wife. Since then it has operated as a live performance venue, hosting concerts and live music. 

In June 2011 the theatre was purchased for million by a consortium headed by Rennie Cristini. In 2013, the property sold for million.(&quot;Illawarra Mercury&quot;, 15 November 2013).

In 2019, Midnight Oil launched their &quot;The Final Tour&quot; at Anita&#x27;s Theatre.

In July 2022, Live Nation Australia Venues Pty Ltd acquired the operations of Anita&#x27;s Theatre, with a view to providing a good regional live music venue for Australian artists.

== Heritage listings ==
Thirroul has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Illawarra railway: Thirroul railway station

==Commerce &amp; services==
The town&#x27;s major commercial area lies between an area just north of Bulli Pass, where the Princes Highway splits to form the Lawrence Hargrave Drive, to Thirroul Station, over the bridge and past the main centre and the Anita&#x27;s Theatre building. Supermarkets include a Coles and IGA. Thirroul is steadily growing in population, and many new shops are added regularly. Many cafes now exist in Thirroul&#x27;s main commercial area, adding to its popularity as a seaside holiday town. Thirroul has many fashion, gift and lifestyle shops along the main streets. Thirroul is also home to King&#x27;s Theatre (1913), which underwent large-scale renovations in 2006/2007 and was renamed to Anita&#x27;s Theatre by the developer John Comelli, in honour of his late wife. Anita&#x27;s Theatre was for sale as of May 2010 but was purchased for 1.05 million dollars in 2011 by a Balgownie business man. The boutique clothing and jewellery shops, florists, supermarkets, news agencies and other shopping essentials make it the main shopping area for the northern suburbs of Wollongong. Thirroul also has a sub-branch of the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL).

Thirroul is part of the Northern Illawarra Chamber of Commerce, which was established in 1996 and is recognised as an official body by the Wollongong City Council. Its aim is to promote the identity of the Northern Illawarra in co-operation with local business owners, the residents community, and government and tourism bodies to generate local business growth for the region.
There are two primary schools, St. Michael&#x27;s and Thirroul Public School. St. Michael&#x27;s is a Catholic school that was established by the Sisters of St. Joseph in 1940 and is located in Station Street. Thirroul Public school was established in 1889 after Frederick Robbins sold one acre of his land, &quot;well situated and elevated, being the centre of population&quot;, to the Department of Education for the purpose of building a school and teacher&#x27;s residence. The school subsequently opened in 1889 with 154 children on the roll. Thirroul Public School is located in Roxburgh Avenue. Thirroul also has a Thirroul Scout Group as part of the Scout Association of Australia, NSW Branch.
In June 2009, the new Thirroul District Library and Community centre was opened. This library offers email and word processing, inter-library loans, photocopying and printing, free Internet access and children&#x27;s programs.

The annual Thirroul Seaside &amp; Arts Festival is held over a weekend in the first week of April. It includes activities such as art exhibitions and workshops, kids activities, live stage entertainment, buskers, a variety of stalls, pony and carnival rides and face painting. The festival won the 2003 Illawarra tourism Award in the events/festivals category. Involved in organising the event is the Austimer-Thirroul Lions Club. The festival actively involves community organisations, educational institutions, sporting groups, performing and visual art studios, scouts, surf lifesavers and the general public.

== Transport ==

Thirroul railway station is a major station on the NSW TrainLink South Coast line. Although not as important as in steam days, it is the major station between Wollongong and the Sydney metropolitan area. Local Wollongong suburban services terminate at Thirroul, while all Intercity services stop at Thirroul, both express and all stations trains. In 2005, the station was equipped with lifts.

Thirroul retains a number of passing / refuge sidings for the many coal trains from Metropolitan Colliery and the western coalfields which pass through the town.

Lawrence Hargrave Drive starts just south of Thirroul at the Princes Highway in Bulli and travels north through Thirroul, connecting with the Old Princes Highway and Southern Freeway at the Helensburgh exit.

== Thirroul Beach ==
Thirroul beach is a prominent feature, as well as the backdrop of the high escarpment, attracting many bush-walkers to northern Austinmer and surfers to both beaches. The beach is popular with both locals and tourists, becoming particularly busy in summer months and long weekends. The beach is long and backed by a large, grassy reserve. Swimming can be potentially hazardous because of permanent and shifting rips. The beach is patrolled in summer and a ocean pool is located near the beach.

The Thirroul Surf Lifesaving Club was established in 1907 as one of 14 foundation clubs in NSW. The SLSC is the home of the Thirroul Seagulls IRB (Inflatable rescue boat) Racing Team, who have competed strongly for the last 15 years. Former Ironman champions Darren and Dean Mercer are from Thirroul and their parents still reside in the town.

The southern end of Thirroul Beach is also known as McCauley&#x27;s Beach. McCauley&#x27;s Beach is separated from Thirroul Beach proper by rock platforms and is a popular off-leash dog beach.

Thirroul is an exposed beach and reef break, and has reliable surf all year. The most desirable wind for surfing there is offshore winds from the west north-west. Most of the surf comes from |groundswells, with the best swell direction the south-east. The beach break provides for both left and right-handers. Caution should be taken with rips, rocks, sharks and, during the summer, bluebottles.

== Natural environment and wildlife ==

The Sandon Point Stockland development, has given rise to much controversy and conflict between developers and environmental and Aboriginal groups over Aboriginal heritage and coastal wetland and floodplain since 1989, is just south in Bulli. Dootch Kennedy, Al Oshlack and Karen Gough have co-ordinated a series of legal actions against the development&#x27;s impact on Aboriginal heritage. This protest is ongoing, and included a 24/7 picket for five years before an arson attack, and a continuing Aboriginal Tent Embassy. Resident Jill Walker has been heroic in taking Stockland and the Minister for Planning to both the Land and Environment and Supreme Courts over a number of outstanding non-Aboriginal environmental issues relating to the development. It is also the starting/finishing point to the bike track that runs south to Wollongong, the Wollongong to Thirroul Bike Track. The escarpment area is rich in its variety of birdlife. Recorded birds in the northern suburbs of Wollongong include the Australian King Parrot, Crimson Rosella, Eastern Sea Eagle and the Brown Gerygone.

==Sport==
Sporting teams have been a prominent part of Thirroul history and the &quot;working class&quot; people that established the village. Many of the existing sporting clubs having history dating back to the early settlement.

Thirroul is represented in the Tooheys Illawarra Rugby League by the Thirroul Butchers. The Butchers were established in 1913. The Thirroul Butchers attract crowds between 500 and 1500 a game, depending on their opponents.

Thirroul is also home to the Thirroul Junior Football Club (TJFC). The club consists of many male &amp; female junior teams ranging from under 6&#x27;s to under 18&#x27;s, 4 senior women&#x27;s sides and 3 senior men&#x27;s. In 2002 the first senior women&#x27;s football side was entered into the local IWSA competition, that team went on to finish third in their inaugural season. The first senior men&#x27;s side, the Thunder, was established for the 2008 season. That same year the women&#x27;s sides became affectionately known as: &#x27;The Thunderbirds&#x27;. As of Thirroul is the only club in the Illawarra to enter a women&#x27;s team into each of the IWFA&#x27;s 4 competitions: Premier / Reserve Grade, Division 1 and Over 30s.

Thirroul is also part of the Northern Suburbs Netball Club. The Thirroul Amateur Swimming Club has been operating in Thirroul since 1954. Swim nights are conducted weekly between October and March. The club is non-profit and affiliated with NSW Swimming.

Thirroul District Cricket Club was established in 1896. It is believed the original home ground was the current site of Slacky Flat, before games moved to Gibson Park in the early 1900s. In 1976/77, Woonona Cricket Club folded and merged with Thirroul Cricket Club. In the mid-1990s, the unenviable decision to relocate the club&#x27;s home ground to Hollymount Park, Woonona was made and in 1996 the Senior division of the club underwent a name change from Thirroul Cricket Club to Northern Districts Cricket Club. Initially matches were played on the western turf pitch of Hollymount Park however in 2005 a new five (5) pitch turf wicket square was installed on the Eastern side of Hollymount Park and the Eastern clubhouse was redeveloped. The junior division of the club incorporates both names as Thirroul &amp; Northern Districts Cricket Club.

== Development pressures ==

It is an easy commute from Thirroul to Sydney CBD by train. This has made it a popular destination for city dwellers looking for a ‘sea-change’. Thirroul has many well-proportioned housing blocks. These are either being re-developed, or dual-occupied, increasing housing density in the Suburb. This has put pressure on the road infrastructure. Lawrence Hargrave Drive is the only through road in the northern suburbs of the Illawarra. The increased dwelling density is seeing a growth in congestion on the main arterial route.

Thirroul is one of only two designated villages in the Wollongong Local Government Area. The backdrop to the Thirroul town centre is the iconic Illawarra escarpment. Key to the village atmosphere is the shopping strip where residents and tourists can easily park in the village to visit local cafes and shops. Residents are concerned that the village feel of the suburb is threatened by the increased development pressures being placed on the area.

In early 2020 a large development application was lodged for the redevelopment of the Thirroul Plaza site. The current plaza is a single storey, purely commercial enterprise, and contains no residences.  The application (DA-2020/363) proposes a three-storey structure that would retain the commercial operation and see 80 residential units developed on the site. The size of the structure would also significantly impair the view to the escarpment from the village shopping strip. The development also requires the elimination of most of the kerbside parking in the village. Business owners and residents alike are very concerned about the impact this development will have on Thirroul village.

In 2020 a group called Save Thirroul Village was set up to work alongside the Thirroul Village Committee to oppose the development application proposing the redevelopment of the Thirroul Plaza site. STV was formed to assist the community in lodging objections. A number of objections from local residents and businesses were lodged against this development over the four iterations of the application. The groups are working together to promote the best outcomes for development within Thirroul.

==In popular culture==

Thirroul features in the musical piece &quot;Small Town&quot; by Australian composer Peter Sculthorpe. A note published by Faber Music states that forty years after the visit of D.H. Lawrence and his novel &quot;Kangaroo&quot;, &quot;Peter Sculthorpe envisaged Thirroul as the quintessential Australian town, frozen in a more innocent time&quot;. The music evokes the architecture of the town, the township monument and includes a rendering of the Last Post evoking an Anzac Day ceremony at the town war memorial.

<doc id="1113211" wikidata="Q240913" url="?curid=1113211" title="Associated Equipment Company">
<text>Associated Equipment Company (AEC) was a British vehicle manufacturer that built buses, motorcoaches and trucks from 1912 until 1979. The name Associated Equipment Company was hardly ever used; instead, it traded under the AEC and ACLO brands. During World War One, AEC was the most prolific British lorry manufacturer, after building London&#x27;s buses before the war.

==History==
===Inception===
The London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) was founded in 1855 to amalgamate and regulate the horse-drawn omnibus services then operating in London. The company began producing motor omnibuses for its own use in 1909 with the X-type designed by its chief motor engineer, Frank Searle, at works in Blackhorse Lane, Walthamstow. The X-type was followed by Searle&#x27;s B-type design, considered to be one of the first mass-produced commercial vehicles.

In 1912, LGOC was taken over by the Underground Group of companies, which at that time owned most of the London Underground, and extensive tram operations. As part of the reorganisation following the takeover, a separate concern was set up for the bus manufacturing elements, and was named Associated Equipment Company, better-known as AEC.
AEC&#x27;s first commercial vehicle was a lorry based on the X-type bus chassis. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, AEC&#x27;s ability to produce large numbers of vehicles using moving-track assembly lines, based on American principles, became important in supplying the increasing need for army lorries. AEC commenced large-scale production of their 3-ton Y-type lorry in 1916, including some with Daimler-built engines, badged and supplied as Daimler. Continued beyond the end of the war, over 10,000 Y-type lorries were manufactured – making AEC Britain&#x27;s largest domestic provider of lorries for the nation&#x27;s military. From then on, AEC became associated with both lorries and buses.

===Interwar years===
In 1926, AEC and Daimler formed the Associated Daimler Company, which was dissolved two years later. In 1927, AEC moved its manufacturing from Walthamstow to a new plant at Southall.

G. J. Rackham was appointed Chief Engineer and Designer in 1928. He had previously worked for Leyland Motors. His ideas contributed significantly to AEC&#x27;s reputation for quality and reliability.

From 1929, AEC produced new models: the names of lorries began with &quot;M&quot; (Majestic, Mammoth, Mercury, and so on), and those of buses began with &quot;R&quot; (Regent, Regal, Renown, and so on). These original &quot;M-models&quot; continued in production until the end of World War II. AEC introduced diesel engines across the range in the mid-1930s.

From 1931 to 1938, AEC and English Electric co-produced trolleybuses. AEC supplied the chassis, and English Electric the electric motors and control equipment.

In 1932, AEC took a controlling interest in the British subsidiary of the American Four Wheel Drive (FWD) company, and began to use more standard AEC components in those vehicles, including the AEC 850 artillery tractor. To avoid confusion, these were marketed under the name &quot;Hardy&quot;. Production ceased about 1936.

===World War II===

Non-military production stopped in 1941, from then until 1944 AEC produced nearly 10,000 vehicles for the war effort. During the war, AEC produced their 10-ton 4x4 Matador artillery tractor (an adaptation of their commercial 4x2 Matador lorry that exploited AEC&#x27;s experience with the Hardy FWD venture). The Matador was used for towing guns such as the 5.5-inch medium gun and the 3.7-inch AA gun. The Matador chassis was used as the basis for the Deacon a self-propelled 6-pounder anti-tank gun, which was used briefly in North Africa.

A 6x6 version was designated as the &quot;AEC Marshall&quot; but almost always called the Matador.

Four hundred AEC armoured command vehicles, popularly known as the &quot;Dorchester&quot; (after the hotel), were built on the Matador and Marshall chassis.

Production of the AEC armoured car started in 1941. Three marks were built, with guns from 40 mm to 75 mm, totalling 629 vehicles. They remained in use post-war.

===Post war===


In 1946 AEC and Leyland Motors formed British United Traction as a joint venture to manufacture trolleybuses and traction equipment for diesel railcars since reduced demand would not require the existing capacity of both parents.

In 1946 AEC resumed civilian production with the 0661/20 Regent II and the 0662/20 Regal I. These were not new models but a recommencement of the most basic AEC 1939 specification bus models. The single-decker was going to be marketed as Regal II until somebody at Southall remembered the 1936-8 lightweight 0862 model of that name and as a result the name was corrected after the launch publicity had been printed. At the end of 1946 the postwar 0961 RT was in build and by 1948 Mammoth Major, Matador and Monarch Mk IIIs were in production, followed by the &#x27;provincial&#x27; Regent III and the Regal III.

Also in 1948 AEC acquired Crossley Motors and the Maudslay Motor Company and on 1 October 1948 AEC set up Associated Commercial Vehicles (ACV) as the holding company for the newly acquired businesses and its own manufacturing firm, which was renamed AEC Limited. The initials AEC remained on its vehicles, with the exception of some badge-engineered versions, such as the Crossley Regent bus. In 1949 ACV acquired the bus coachbuilding company Park Royal Vehicles, along with its subsidiary Charles H Roe. Park Royal designed a new cab for the AEC Mercury in the mid-1950s, which appeared on all models across the range about this time.

In 1961 ACV acquired Thornycroft. The Thornycroft name disappeared from all the vehicles except the specialist airport crash tenders, such as the Nubian, and the Antar off-road tractor unit. Production of the AEC Dumptruk was transferred to Basingstoke, and the Thornycroft six-speed constant-mesh gearbox and later nine and ten-speed range-change versions were fitted to AEC, Albion and Leyland buses and lorries.

The AEC engines were used in Finnish Vanaja lorries and buses in the 1960s.

===Leyland takeover===
Leyland Motors acquired ACV in 1962. AEC lorries were given the same &quot;Ergomatic&quot; cabs used across several Leyland marques (including Albion). In 1968, all AEC double-decker buses ceased production with the completion of the last Routemasters, and its last buses, motorcoaches and lorries were built in 1979. The AEC name actually disappeared from commercial vehicles in 1977, but the Leyland Marathon was built at the Southall plant until British Leyland closed it in 1979. In 1979, the production of Leyland (AEC) vehicles was transferred to remaining Leyland Truck and Bus plants.

==Foreign operations==
===ACLO===
ACLO was the brand name used by AEC in Latin America and in Spain to sell all their products.

ACLOs were principally found in Argentina, Brazil, and particularly in Uruguay, where there were two ACLO fleets (150 buses in total) built by Verheul in the Netherlands on the Regal Mark IV chassis. They were interesting buses, faster than Leyland Tiger in use by other fleets. It was said at the time (early &#x27;60s) that the main reason was inter-urban gearing instead of purely urban gearing present in Leylands. An interesting feature was the preselector gear-change, similar to those in Leyland buses, controlled by a small gated lever installed by the steering wheel, with a reversed gate, with first gear to the right and up, and fourth gear to the bottom and left. In Argentina, 25 Verheul buses also built on the Regal Mark IV chassis were sold in 1961.

In Spain, ACLOs could be seen mainly as double-deck buses in Barcelona, and as line coaches in ALSA fleet.

===UTIC-AEC===
In Portugal, the AEC vehicles, mainly coaches and buses but also lorries, were assembled and bodied by UTIC, a large coachbuilding firm based in Lisbon and Oporto, and were marketed under the UTIC-AEC badge. AEC based vehicles were market leaders in Portugal, for instance, by the time of creation of Rodoviária Nacional, in 1975, those accounted for 67.5% of the more than 2500 buses and coaches inherited fleet. Production remained strong throughout the late 1970s and would cease in the end of 1980.

From 1971 to 1973 the Loughborough based dealer Moseley imported nine UTIC U2043 coaches which were marketed as the Moseley Continental Tagus. They were mechanically equivalent to a rear-engined Reliance or a coach version of the Swift 691 which AEC had planned but never marketed. They were expensive to buy new and the square sided styling looked dated to British eyes in the age of the Elite and Dominant coaches, thus they were slow selling. These were probably the only right hand drive coaches built by UTIC. At the time Moseley also marketed Salvador Caetano Coaches under its own name.
===Barreiros AEC===
In the late 1950s, Spanish government restrictions on imports reduced AEC sales in Spain to virtually nil. As a consequence, AEC approached a Spanish truck manufacturer, Barreiros Diesel, to jointly produce buses and coaches based on AEC designs. The venture started in 1961, used Barreiros AEC as brand name, disregarding ACLO, and seemed very promising; production of the AEC off-road dump trucks being planned too. Nevertheless, the Leyland takeover in 1962 soon undermined the agreement, as Leyland was partnering with Barreiros&#x27;s Spanish arch-rival, Pegaso; and eventually Barreiros looked for another collaborator in the bus arena, signing in 1967 an agreement with Belgian company Van Hool.

==Vehicles==
===Buses===
===Lorries and other commercial vehicles===

;Y Type
AEC&#x27;s first purpose-built commercial vehicle, the Y Type was introduced in 1915. The improved YA Type appeared in 1917. More than ten thousand of these vehicles were supplied to the War Department by 1919. Many of these were acquired by civilian operators following the war. YB and YC Types continued in production until 1921.

;Model 201

;Model 428

;Model 501 &amp; 506

;Model 701

;Roadtrain
The AEC Roadtrain was an experimental early 1930s road train.

;Majestic
There were three distinct incarnations of the AEC Majestic:
* Majestic, model 666 (built 1930–36) – 6 ton normal-control lorry.
* Majestic, models 3521/3531 (1950–57) – 10-ton twin-steer (&quot;Chinese six&quot;) 6x2 cabover.
* Majestic, model GB6 (1959–68), – 6x4 variant of heavy normal-control Mogul, built primarily for export and specialist uses.
;Mammoth
The AEC Mammoth was introduced in 1930, being largest truck in the AEC range and the first to be available as a cabover. It was originally a 7/8 ton 4x2 lorry with a six-cylinder overhead valve engine developing on a wheelbase of 16 ft 7 in. A 6x4 variant was the &quot;Mammoth Major&quot;. From 1934 a distinction was made between the lighter Mammoth Minor, and the heavier Mammoth Major 6 (6x4) and Mammoth Major 8 (8x2 or 8x4), which appeared in 1934. The Mammoth Major Mk II was introduced in 1935; the eight-wheeler could carry 15-ton loads. It remained in production until 1948 when it was superseded by the Mk III, which was mechanically similar, but had the Park Royal cab. Subsequent Mammoth Majors featured the Mk V cab, and finally the tilting Ergomatic cab. The original 4x2 Mammoth and lightweight Mammoth Minor were relatively short-lived models, but both names were later re-used.

* Mammoth, model 667 (1930–34) – 4x2 cabover
* Mammoth Major 6 Mk.I/II, models 668 (1930–35), 366/O366 (1935–48) – 6x4 cabover (Mk.II from 1934)
* Mammoth Major 6 Mk.III, models 3671/3672/3673 (1948–60) – 6x4 cabover (&#x27;tin front&#x27; cab from 1955)
* Mammoth Major 6 Mk.V, models G6 (1959–66) – 6x4 cabover
* Mammoth Major 6, model TG6R (1965–78) – 6x4 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab)
* Mammoth Major 8 Mk.II, models 680 (1934–35), 386/O386 (1935–48) – 8x4 cabover
* Mammoth Major 8 Mk.III, models 3871/3872/3873/3881/3882 (1948–61)- 8x4 cabover (&#x27;tin front&#x27; cab from 1955)
* Mammoth Major 8 Mk.V, model G8 (1959–66) – 8x4 cabover,
* Mammoth Major 8, model TG8R (1966–78) – 8x4 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab)
* Mammoth Minor, model 366L (1936–41) – lightweight 6x2 cabover
* Mammoth Minor, model TG6RF (1965–67) – twin-steer (&quot;Chinese six&quot;) 6x2 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab)

Normal control variants of the Mammoth family were also available, although much less common that the cabovers:

* Mammoth Major 6 Mk.I/II, model 266 (1930–36) and 366 (1936–48) – 6x2 normal control 
* Mammoth Major 6 Mk.III, models 2671 (1948–60) and 2621/2631 (1956–62) – 6x4 normal control
* Mammoth Mk.III, model 2421/2431 (1956–62), 4x2 normal control
;Mandator
The AEC Mandator name was originally used for medium-duty models in the 1930s, but in 1949 the Matador 4x2 was renamed Mandator. The name was used for the heavier AEC 4x2s until the end of production in the 1970s, and was especially popular as a tractor unit.

* Mandator, model 669 (1931–35) – medium-duty 4x2 cabover
* Mandator, model 672 (1931–32) – medium-duty 4x2 normal control
* Mandator Mk.III, models 3472/3474/3475 (1949–55) – 4x2 cabover. Successor to model 3471 Matador.
* Mandator Mk.III, model 2472 (1949–61) – 4x2 normal-control
* Mandator Mk.III, models 3481/3482/3483/3484 (1955–61) – 4x2 cabover (&#x27;tin front&#x27; cab)
* Mandator Mk.V, model G4 (1959–66) – 4x2 cabover
* Mandator, model TG4 (1965–78) – 4x2 cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab)

:Marathon
The Leyland Marathon (1973–79) was a high powered 4x2 or 6x4 tractor unit with a modified Ergomatic cab, which was built at the AEC factory in Southall. A few were given AEC badges to satisfy individual customer preferences. The Marathon name had formerly been used on a Maudslay bus chassis.

;Marshal
Pre-war 6x4 3ton military lorry built with various body styles- some were employed by the Royal Air Force as cranes (using the Coles Crane). The name was reintroduced for 6x2 and 6x4 medium-duty lorries from the 1960s-1970s.

* Marshal, model 644 (1932/35-41) – 6x4 military truck. Prototypes (1932) included both normal-control and cabover versions, but all production vehicles were cabovers.
* Marshal, model GM6 (1961–66) – 6x2 or 6x4 medium-duty cabover (Mk.V cab)
* Marshal, model TGM6 (1965–77) – 6x2 or 6x4 medium-duty cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab). Variant with larger (but downrated) engine was known as Marshal Major, model 2TGM6
* Marshal 8, model TGM8 (1967–68) 8x4 medium duty cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab)

;Matador
The original AEC Matador five-ton 4x2 commercial lorry was introduced in 1932, but the name was most famously used for the 4x4 artillery tractor version introduced in 1938. These vehicles exploited AEC&#x27;s experience with four-wheel drive that it had gained from its involvement in the British Four Wheel Drive vehicles marketed under the name Hardy. AEC produced 9,620 artillery tractors; 514 6x6 bowsers for the Royal Air Force; 192 6x6 lorries (some of which had Coles Cranes mounted); and 185 similar vehicles, but 6x4, for mobile oxygen plants. They were known by the nickname &quot;Mat&quot;. New civilian Matadors appeared after the war, and many ex-military Matadors were adapted for post-war commercial use, especially as timber lorries and recovery vehicles. There was a final short run of the 0853 4x4 Matador for the Army in the early fifties, due to ongoing issues with the introduction of the replacement Leyland. The last Matador was a 4x4 variant of the Mercury, introduced in 1960.

* Matador Mk.I, model 645 (1932–35) – 4x2 cabover version of Mercury
* Matador Mk.II, model 346/O346 (1935–47) – 4x2 cabover. Model 236/O246 (1935–40) was the normal-control version
* Matador Mk.II/III, model 853/O853 (1938–59) – 4x4 cabover (Mk.III from 1947)
* Matador Mk.III, model 3471 (1947–49) – 4x2 cabover. Renamed Mandator in 1949
* Matador, model 4GM4 (1960–65) – 4x4 cabover (Mk.V cab, but marketed as &quot;Matador Mk.II&quot;)

The Matador name is often used for the 10-ton 6x6 military vehicles of Model 854/O854 (built 1940–44), but this model was never given an official name. It was an extended Matador chassis, mated to a Marshal double-drive bogie.

;Mercury
The AEC Mercury (Model 440) was first built in 1928. This was a forward-control lorry with a wheelbase of for 4 ton payloads. The Model 640 was introduced in 1930, with a four-cylinder petrol engine developing 65 bhp.

The name was resurrected for medium-duty 4x2 lorries and tractors built from the 1950s to the 1970s.

* Mercury, model 640 (1928–37) – 4x2 normal control
* Mercury, model G4M (1953–65) – 4x2 medium-duty cabover. The Mk.I (1953–55) usually had a Duramin cab, whereas the Mk.II (1955–65) usually had Park Royal cabs (&#x27;tin front&#x27; and later Mk.V cabs). Other cab manufacturers included Bowyers. In some export markets this model was sold as Monarch
* Mercury, model TGM4 (1964–77) – 4x2 medium duty cabover (Ergomatic tilting cab). In some export markets (notably New Zealand) this model was sold as a Monarch
;Militant
The AEC Militant – or &quot;Milly&quot; – was the 1952 replacement for the Matador; a 6x4 or 6x6 artillery tractor/military lorry which continued in various forms until the 1970s. The Militant name had earlier been used by Maudslay in the 1930s.

* Militant Mk.I, models O859 and O860 (1952–66) – 6x4 and 6x6 cabover
* Militant Mk.II (1962, prototypes only) – 6x6 cabover (Park Royal Mk.V type cab)
* Militant Mk.III models O870 and O880 (1966–79) – 6x6 cabover. These were the last vehicles to use a variant of the AEC/Park Royal cab.

;Mogul
The AEC Mogul model GM4 (1959–67) was a normal-control 4x2 built primarily for export markets. The Mogul name had originally been used on Maudslay lorries.

;Monarch
The original AEC Monarch was built from 1931 to 1939 at AEC&#x27;s Southall works. The first version had payload of 7 tons (increased to tons from 1933) and was fitted with either an four-cylinder 5.1-litre diesel engine or an 80 hp four-cylinder 5.1-litre petrol engine. This was a robust and well-designed lorry, popular with both drivers and operators. The model was discontinued in the 1950s, although the name lived on into the 1970s in some export markets. TL 3513 (1934) KYE 402 (1949)

* Monarch Mk.I, models 641 (1930–33) and 647/648 (1933–35) – 4x2 cabover
* Monarch Mk.II, models 344/346/O346 (1935–47) – 4x2 cabover. There was also a normal-control version, model 244 (1935–40)
* Monarch Mk.III, models O345/3451 (1947–56) – 4x2 cabover
* Monarch, model TGM4 (see Mercury TGM4)

;Mustang
The AEC Mustang model GM6 (1956–61) was a medium-weight, twin-steer (&quot;Chinese six&quot;) 6x2 cabover, derived from the Mercury

;Dump Trucks
From 1957 to 1971 AEC built a series of large off-road dump trucks:
* Model 3673M (1957–63) – 6x4 half-cab derived from Mammoth Major, with 10 cubic yard dump dumper capacity
* Model HDK4 (1959–65) – 4x4 normal-control with 18 cu/yd capacity
* Model DK6 (1961–62) – 6x4 or 6x6 semi-cabover derived from Militant, 10 cu/yd capacity.
* Model BDK6 (1964–71) – normal-control 6-wheeler, 10 cu/yd capacity. Based on Thornycroft design. Also sold as under the Leyland, Aveling Barford and Scammell brands

==Centenary celebrations==
2012 was the centenary of the founding of AEC Ltd, and to mark this, a number of events took place throughout the year. By far the biggest was hosted by The AEC Society, and was held over the weekend of 26 and 27 May 2012 at Newark Showground in Nottinghamshire. It was the biggest ever gathering of AECs vehicles, and over 225 attended, as well as more than 350 vehicles of other marques. It was the biggest rally ever held by The AEC Society and was closed by a flypast by the Battle of Britain memorial flight.

<doc id="1113213" wikidata="Q1319910" url="?curid=1113213" title="Constitution of Vietnam">
<text>The Vietnamese Constitution or the Constitution of Vietnam (), fully the Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (), is the fundamental and supreme law of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The current constitution was adopted on November 28, 2013, by the Thirteenth National Assembly and took effect on January 1, 2014, being the third constitution adopted by the Vietnamese state since the political reunification of the country in 1976.

==Current constitution==
The current constitution, known as the 2013 Constitution, contains a preamble and 11 chapters:
* Chapter I: Political System
* Chapter II: Human Rights, Basic Civil Rights and Civic Duties
* Chapter III: The Economy, Society, Culture, Education, Science, Technology, and the Environment
* Chapter IV: Defence of the Homeland
* Chapter V: The National Assembly
* Chapter VI: President of the Republic
* Chapter VII: The Government
* Chapter VIII: The People&#x27;s Court and the People&#x27;s Procuracy
* Chapter IX: Local Government
* Chapter X: The National Electoral Council and the State Audit Office
* Chapter XI: The Effect of the Constitution and Amending the Constitution

==Previous constitutions==
The Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) had two constitutions: 
* 1946 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, adopted on November 9, 1946.
* 1959 Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, adopted on December 31, 1959.

The former Republic of Vietnam also had two constitutions, adopted in 1956 and 1967. Neither of these constitutional documents is in force, as the 1967 Constitution was abrogated when the government of the Republic of Vietnam collapsed in 1975.

Upon political reunification of the country in 1976, the 1960 Constitution of the Democratic Republic became the constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. Since then, the Vietnamese government adopted two constitutions before the 2013 Constitution:
* 1980 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, adopted on December 19, 1980.
* 1992 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, adopted on April 25, 1992, and amended in 2001.

===1946 Constitution===
The 1946 constitution adopted a semi-presidential system similar to the French constitution; it allowed for multiple parties to participate in elections.

According to the 1946 constitution, the president of the republic, was the head of government, rather than a ceremonial head of state. The president also had significantly more power than the current office of president. The later 1959 constitution turned the president into a ceremonial head, while giving de facto power to the party leader.

Despite the changes in later constitution, the current Vietnamese government still heavily praises it, calling it &quot;one of the world&#x27;s most democratic constitution[s] at the time.&quot;

===1959 Constitution===
While the 1946 constitution was a superficially liberal democratic document, its 1959 successor was a fully communist document. Its preamble defined the DRV as a &quot;people&#x27;s democratic state led by the working class&quot;, thus codifying the actual state of affairs that had prevailed since 1945. The document provided for a nominal separation of powers among legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. On paper, the legislative function was carried out by the National Assembly. The assembly was empowered to make laws and to elect the chief officials of the state, such as the president (who was largely a symbolic head of state), the vice president, and cabinet ministers. Together those elected (including the president and vice president) formed a Council of Ministers, which constitutionally (but not in practice) was subject to supervision by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. Headed by a prime minister, the council was the highest executive organ of state authority. Besides overseeing the Council of Ministers, the assembly&#x27;s Standing Committee nominally supervised the Supreme People&#x27;s Court, the chief organ of the judiciary. The assembly&#x27;s executive side nominally decided on national economic plans, approved state budgets, and acted on questions of war or peace. In reality, however, the final authority on all matters rested with the Political Bureau.

===1980 Constitution===
The 1959 document had been adopted during the tenure of Ho Chi Minh and demonstrated a certain independence from the Soviet model of state organization. The 1980 Constitution was drafted when Vietnam faced a serious threat from China, and political and economic dependence on the Soviet Union had increased. Perhaps, as a result, the completed document resembles the 1977 Soviet Constitution, which is evident in the principle of dictatorship of the proletariat, the exclusive leadership of the Communist Party, the centrally planned economy, the citizen&#x27;s duties and statist rights, and the Leninist constitutional structure consisting of the supreme National Assembly, the collective presidency called the Council of State, the subordinate government called Council of Ministers, the procuracies, and the courts.

The reunification of North and South Vietnam (the former Republic of Vietnam) in 1976 provided the primary motivation for revising the 1959 constitution. Revisions were made along ideological lines set forth at the Fourth National Congress of the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) in 1976, emphasizing popular sovereignty and promising success in undertaking &quot;revolutions&quot; in production, science and technology, culture, and ideology. In keeping with the underlying theme of a new beginning associated with reunification, the constitution also stressed the need to develop a new political system, a new economy, a new culture, and a new socialist person.

The 1980 Vietnamese Constitution concentrates power in a newly established Council of State, much like the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, endowing it nominally with both legislative and executive powers. Many functions of the legislature remain the same as under the 1959 document, but others have been transferred to the executive branch or assigned to both branches concurrently. The executive branch appears strengthened overall, having gained a second major executive body, the Council of State, and the importance of the National Assembly appears to have been reduced accordingly. The role of the Council of Ministers, while appearing on paper to have been subordinated to the new Council of State, in practice retained its former primacy.

Among the innovative features of the 1980 document is the concept of &quot;collective mastery&quot; of society, a frequently used expression attributed to the late party secretary Le Duan (1907 - 1986). The concept is a Vietnamese version of popular sovereignty, which advocates an active role for the people so that they may become their own masters as well as masters of society, nature, and the nation. It states that the people&#x27;s collective mastery in all fields is assured by the state and is implemented by permitting the participation in state affairs of mass organizations. On paper, these organizations, to which almost all citizens belong, play an active role in government and have the right to introduce bills before the National Assembly.

Another feature is the concept of socialist legality, which dictates that &quot;the state manage society according to law and constantly strengthen the socialist legal system.&quot; The concept, introduced at the Third National Party Congress in 1960, calls for achieving socialist legality through the state, its organizations, and its people. Law, in effect, is made subject to the decisions and directives of the party.

The 1980 Constitution comprises 147 articles, in 12 chapters, dealing with numerous subjects, including the basic rights and duties of citizens. Article 67 guarantees the citizens&#x27; rights to freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, and the freedom to demonstrate. These rights, however, were subject to a caveat stating that, &quot;no one may misuse democratic freedoms to violate the interests of the state and the people.&quot; In practice, the party and the government had considerable latitude to determine what was in &quot;the interests of the state and the people.&quot;

=== 1992 Constitution ===
In light of the Đổi Mới (market reforms) adopted by Vietnam beginning on 18 December 1986 and the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, Vietnam adopted a new constitution in April 1992. The 1992 constitution adopted a &quot;socialist oriented market economy&quot;, which allowed the development of private economic sectors, but it largely retained the previous constitutional structure.

<text>An anode ray (also positive ray or canal ray) is a beam of positive ions that is created by certain types of gas-discharge tubes. They were first observed in Crookes tubes during experiments by the German scientist Eugen Goldstein, in 1886. Later work on anode rays by Wilhelm Wien and J. J. Thomson led to the development of mass spectrometry.

==Anode ray tube==

Goldstein used a gas-discharge tube which had a perforated cathode. When an electrical potential of several thousand volts is applied between the cathode and anode, faint luminous &quot;rays&quot; are seen extending from the holes in the back of the cathode. These rays are beams of particles moving in a direction opposite to the &quot;cathode rays&quot;, which are streams of electrons which move toward the anode. Goldstein called these positive rays &quot;Kanalstrahlen&quot;, &quot;channel rays&quot;, or &quot;canal rays&quot;, because these rays passed through the holes or &quot;channels&quot; in the cathode.

The process by which anode rays are formed in a gas-discharge anode ray tube is as follows. When the high voltage is applied to the tube, its electric field accelerates the small number of ions (electrically charged atoms) always present in the gas, created by natural processes such as radioactivity. These collide with atoms of the gas, knocking electrons off them and creating more positive ions. These ions and electrons in turn strike more atoms, creating more positive ions in a chain reaction. The positive ions are all attracted to the negative cathode, and some pass through the holes in the cathode. These are the anode rays.

By the time they reach the cathode, the ions have been accelerated to a sufficient speed such that when they collide with other atoms or molecules in the gas they excite the species to a higher energy level. In returning to their former energy levels these atoms or molecules release the energy that they had gained. That energy gets emitted as light. This light-producing process, called fluorescence, causes a glow in the region behind the cathode.

==Anode ray ion source==
An anode ray ion source typically is an anode coated with the halide salt of an alkali or alkaline earth metal. Application of a sufficiently high electrical potential creates alkali or alkaline earth ions and their emission is most brightly visible at the anode.

<text>İlhan Mansız (born 10 August 1975) is a German-born Turkish former professional footballer who played as a forward. He is also a competing figure skater. He is of Crimean Tatar descent.

==Playing career==
===Club career===
Mansız gained international recognition at Istanbul&#x27;s Beşiktaş J.K., and was later acquired by the Vissel Kobe football club in Japan.

After his Japan journey, he signed a contract with Hertha BSC, but, because of his injury, he never had a chance to play for the first team. His contract was cancelled due to a clause in the contract saying that if his knee was injured again, they would release him. After his short stint with Hertha BSC, İlhan signed a one-year contract with Turkish club Ankaragücü. He was slowly but surely coming back from his plague of injuries and helping Ankaragücü in the Turkcell Super League.

Before the 2006–07 season, he declared his decision to retire from football. As of 2007 there were rumors that he was getting training in Los Angeles, US, to make a comeback to football. These rumors are revealed by İlhan Mansız and he declared to sign contract with Ankaragücü again. However, this final comeback attempt was abandoned before the 2007–08 season, as he announced his retirement.

After a car accident in 2007, it seemed the career of İlhan Mansız had ended. In July 2009, after seven knee operations, he tried to make a comeback by training with German second-division side TSV 1860 Munich.

===International career===
İlhan made his debut for Turkey as a substitute during their final group-stage qualifier against Moldova in October 2001. The speedy striker earned his way onto coach Şenol Güneş&#x27; squad on the strength of an outstanding 2001–02 season for Beşiktaş, when he led the Süper Lig in scoring and helped the squad to a third-place finish.

The best goal of his career came in the 2002 FIFA World Cup quarter final against Senegal. He came on as a substitute for Hakan Şükür in the 67th minute, and netted a golden goal in the 94th minute to send Turkey through to the last four of the competition, in which they ended up taking third place. This was the last time where the golden goal was used in World Cup for extra-time matches. In the third place game İlhan Mansız assisted Hakan Şükür to score the fastest goal ever in a World Cup finals match, and went on to score his team&#x27;s two other goals in the match.

He is also remembered by his rainbow flick against Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos in 2002 World Cup semifinal clash, which was one of the best skill displays of the cup.

Mansız was a relative unknown in international circles prior to the 2002 World Cup. Despite his display of prodigious talent on the world stage, his health concerns and advanced age precluded serious consideration on the part of European clubs. Mansız declared &quot;It is too late for me, I wish I had been discovered sooner in my career.&quot;

==Coaching career==
On 11 July 2018, Beşiktaş J.K. announced via their social media accounts that Mansız was appointed as assistant coach to the club, along with Guti, another former player of club. Mansız quit his job at Beşiktaş on 6 February 2019 due to health concerns.

==Figure skating==

Mansız learned to skate at the relatively late age of 33 when he competed on the Turkish show Buzda Dans, as a pair skater with partner Oľga Beständigová, who is also his girlfriend.

After winning the show, Mansız announced his goal was to represent Turkey at the 2014 Winter Olympics, hoping to become the first athlete to compete in both the football World Cup and the Winter Olympics since Aleksandar Shalamanov of Bulgaria.

Mansız and Beständigová made their competitive debut at the 2013 Nebelhorn Trophy, which was also the final qualifying opportunity for the 2014 Olympics. They finished 19th and last in the pairs event, ending their hope of skating at the Olympic Games. Nonetheless, they continued to compete.

<doc id="1113222" wikidata="Q1969248" url="?curid=1113222" title="10th-Anniversary Stadium">
<text>The 10th-Anniversary Stadium (), opened in 1955, was for decades the largest stadium in Warsaw, and one of the largest in Poland. Under the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, it was one of the most advertised construction sites and a principal venue for Party and state festivities. In the 1980s the stadium became dilapidated, as no funds could be found to refurbish it. After 1989 it was used mainly as a bazaar called Jarmark Europa, becoming famous as the place to buy a whole range of goods, most notably clothes, software, hardware and media. Its demolition began in September 2008, and the new National Stadium was constructed in its place to serve as one of the venues for Euro 2012.

==History==
In 1953 the Association of Polish Architects held an open contest for the project of an &quot;Olympic Stadium for the city of Warsaw&quot;. It was won by the team led by Jerzy Hryniewiecki, Zbigniew Ihnatowicz, and Jerzy Sołtan and later the same year the construction was started. The stadium was constructed mostly with rubble from buildings destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944.

The project involved the construction of an open air oval-shaped Olympic stadium: it contains a football pitch and a 400-metre racing track. Theoretically, the terraces with wooden benches provided seats for 71,008 people, but during the biggest festivals organised there, it accommodated more than 100,000 spectators. In addition, the stadium was equipped with a practice field, a small sports dome, 900 parking spaces and was surrounded by a park. The stadium was also connected to a nearby bus station and a railway station opened specifically for the transport of spectators.

Soon after its opening, it became Poland&#x27;s national stadium. It housed the most important international football matches and athletics competitions, as well as communist party galas, concerts, and commemorative festivals. In addition, it served as the final lap of the Peace Race. In 1968, it was the site of Ryszard Siwiec&#x27;s self-immolation in protest at the invasion of Czechoslovakia during a propaganda festival.

In 1983, due to technical problems, the stadium was abandoned. In 1989 it was rented by the City of Warsaw to a company that turned the stadium into an outdoor market known as Jarmark Europa, which soon became Europe&#x27;s largest open-air market. With over 5,000 traders (and many more unregistered; a large number of traders were from other countries) it was the biggest facility of its kind in Poland. Official figures state an annual turnover of 500 million zlotys, which is generally believed to be an underestimate. 

The top tier of the market included vendors of clothing, souvenirs, and bootlegged CDs and movies. Police say the market was the main selling point for black market goods in the country. Between 1995 and 2001 more than 25,000 traders were prosecuted, while approximately 10 million infringing CDs and videotapes were confiscated. Amongst the English-speaking community in Warsaw, the stadium was often referred to as the &quot;Russian market&quot;.

==New National Stadium==

The old stadium was demolished to prepare for the construction of the new National Stadium accommodating 55,000 spectators. Construction on the stadium was finished in 2011, and it was one of the stadiums hosting the Euro 2012. Adjoining the new stadium there are to be erected the following structures: a 15,000-seat indoor arena, a new railway station &quot;Warszawa Stadion&quot;, a modern hotel, a covered Olympic swimming pool with seats for 4,000 spectators, a meeting hall and a metro station &quot;Stadion&quot; on a yet-to-be built subway line. During the European Championship itself, the following matches are to be played at the stadium: the opening match, group matches, a quarterfinal and a semifinal.

The 10th-Anniversary Stadium and its grounds are the property of the Government of Poland, and the City of Warsaw has declared that for this reason, it would be illegal for the city to financially participate in the project, which is to be financed by the national government.

The building of the National Stadium was delayed by disputes with vendors who protested against orders to leave the 10th-Anniversary Stadium.

<text>The London General Omnibus Company or LGOC, was the principal bus operator in London between 1855 and 1933. It was also, for a short period between 1909 and 1912, a motor bus manufacturer.

== Overview ==

The London General Omnibus Company was founded in 1855 to amalgamate and regulate the many independent horse-drawn omnibus services then operating in London. Originally an enterprise, also known as the Compagnie Generale des Omnibus de Londres, the LGOC soon became the largest omnibus operator in London. It bought out hundreds of independently owned buses and established a consistent level of service for its fleet. Within a year, the LGOC controlled 600 of London&#x27;s 810 omnibuses.

Under its chairman Sir John Pound, in 1902 it looked at an option to purchase a competitor, the Star Omnibus Company, but it was unable to complete negotiations. LGOC began using motor omnibuses in 1902, and the last LGOC horse-drawn bus ran on 25 October 1911.

In 1908 the LGOC bought the Road Car Company, the Vanguard Company, and its other main rivals, thereby gaining a virtual monopoly in London.

The merger of these three companies (the Road Car Company was also known as &quot;Union Jack&quot; owing to its habit of flying the British flag on its vehicles) gave the new and enlarged LGOC the most experienced operating and engineering personnel of any operator - and perhaps manufacturer - in the country at the time.

The LGOC absorbed the Great Eastern London Motor Omnibus Company (previously known as London Motor Omnibus Company) in March 1911.

In 1912, the Underground Group, which owned most of the London Underground, bought the LGOC. This followed the start of negotiations between the two companies in 1910 that finally led to the publication of an official statement regarding the proposed terms of the merger on 19 January 1912. By early February 1912 the majority of shareholders in the LGOC had accepted the terms. This in time allowed increasing co-ordination between LGOC bus and tube services, with integrated fares, such as was seen with the opening of the bus station adjacent to Hammersmith station in April 1914.

In 1933, the LGOC, along with the rest of the Underground Group, became part of the new London Passenger Transport Board. The name London General fell into disuse, and London Transport instead became synonymous with the red London bus.

== Manufacturing ==
LGOC began producing motor omnibuses for its own use in 1909 at works established in premises inherited from Vanguard at Blackhorse Lane, Walthamstow, London. The first model built was the LGOC X-type, which was designed by Frank Searle, LGOC&#x27;s chief engineer. The X-type was followed by the LGOC B-type, from the same designer.

After the Underground Group&#x27;s acquisition of the LGOC in 1912, the bus manufacturing elements of the LGOC were split out to create the Associated Equipment Company (AEC).

==Rebirth of the name==
In the privatisation of London bus services in the 1990s, London Transport created a series of shadow bus operating companies with names of geographic or historic significance, and one of these was christened London General in honour of the LGOC. The new London General was initially privatised by management buy-out, and acquired by the Go-Ahead Group in 1996.

==Popular culture==
“Did you see that bus parked outside the theatre as you came in? It had ‘Private’ on the front. Looked very lonely, it did. I can remember when it was a General!” -Michael Flanders, &quot;A Transport of Delight,&quot; &quot;At The Drop Of A Hat&quot;, 1957

The London General Omnibus Company was featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, played by actor Kenneth Branagh, was depicted arriving in a green horse-drawn London General Omnibus Company Limited bus at the start of the ceremony.

In the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Syndicate&quot; published by Ubisoft in 2015, assassins come to the aid of Edward Hodson Bayley and company, who was said to be responsible for the founding of the united London General Omnibus Company in the storyline campaign, supplying omnibuses for the city.

<text>Felix Martin Julius Steiner (23 May 1896 – 12 May 1966) was a German SS commander during the Nazi era. During World War II, he served in the Waffen-SS, the combat branch of the SS, and commanded several SS divisions and corps. He was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords. Together with Paul Hausser, he contributed significantly to the development and transformation of the Waffen-SS into a combat force made up of volunteers and conscripts from both occupied and un-occupied lands.

Steiner was chosen by Heinrich Himmler to oversee the creation of and then command the SS Division Wiking. In 1943, he was promoted to the command of the III SS Panzer Corps. On 28 January 1945, Steiner was placed in command of the 11th SS Panzer Army, which formed part of a new Army Group Vistula, an ad-hoc formation to defend Berlin from the Soviet armies advancing from the Vistula River.

On 21 April 1945, during the Battle for Berlin, Steiner was placed in command of Army Detachment Steiner, with which Adolf Hitler ordered Steiner to envelop the 1st Belorussian Front through a pincer movement, advancing from the north of the city. However, as his unit was outnumbered ten to one, Steiner made it clear that he did not have the capacity for a counter-attack on 22 April during the daily situation conference in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot;.

After the capitulation of Germany, Steiner was imprisoned and investigated for war crimes. He faced charges at the Nuremberg Trials, but they were dropped and he was released in 1948. In 1953, Steiner was recruited by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to found the &quot;Gesellschaft für Wehrkunde&quot; (&quot;Society for Defense Studies&quot;), composed of former German military officers, as a propaganda tool and a military think tank for the rearmament of West Germany.

Along with other former high-ranking Waffen-SS personnel, Steiner was a founding member of HIAG, a lobby group of negationistic apologists formed in 1951 to campaign for the legal, economic and historical rehabilitation of the Waffen-SS. He died in 1966.

==Early life and World War I==
Steiner was born on 23 May 1896 in Stalluponen in Prussia, (in East Prussia) German Empire. He joined the Royal Prussian Army as an infantry cadet. During World War I, he was awarded the Iron Cross 1st and 2nd class. In 1919, Steiner joined the paramilitary &quot;Freikorps&quot; in the East Prussian city of Memel during the German Revolution and was later incorporated into the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in 1921. In 1933, he left the army having attained the rank of major.

==SS career==
Steiner first joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) (membership number: 4,264,295) and the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). In 1935 he enlisted in the SS. He took command of a battalion of &quot;SS-Verfügungstruppen&quot; (SS-VT) troops, and within a year had been promoted to SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;; and later was put in command of the &quot;SS-Deutschland&quot; Regiment.

At the outbreak of World War II, he was SS-Oberführer (senior leader) in charge of the Waffen-SS regiment &quot;SS-Deutschland&quot;. He led this regiment through the Invasion of Poland and the Battle of France, for which he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 15 August 1940. Steiner was introduced to Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, to oversee the creation of, and then command the new SS Division Wiking. This division was militarily successful but also very barbaric in the invasion of the Soviet Union, for example killing 600 Jews in Zboriv, Ukraine. At the time of its creation, the division consisted mostly of non-German volunteers (Dutch, Flemish, Finns and Scandinavians), including the Danish regiment Frikorps Danmark.

In April 1943, he was placed in command of a newly formed III SS Panzer Corps. The unit participated in anti-partisan actions in Yugoslavia. In November/December 1943 his corps was transferred to the Eastern Front and positioned in the northern sector at Leningrad under Army Group North. Steiner&#x27;s Panzer Corps played a leading role during the Battle of Narva and the Battle of Tannenberg Line. His unit then withdrew with the rest of Army Group North to the Courland Peninsula.

==Battle of Berlin==

In January 1945, Steiner along with the III SS Panzer Corps was transferred by ship from the Courland Pocket to help with the defence of the German homeland. The corps was assigned to Army Group Vistula under the new Eleventh SS Panzer Army although the army really existed only on paper. Once the Soviet Army had reached the Oder River, the Eleventh SS Panzer Army became inactive, and the III SS Panzer Corps was reassigned to the German Third Panzer Army as a reserve during the Soviets&#x27; Berlin Offensive Operation. During the Battle of Seelow Heights, the first major battle of the offensive, General Gotthard Heinrici, the commander of Army Group Vistula, transferred most of the III SS Panzer Corps&#x27; divisions to General Theodor Busse&#x27;s Ninth Army.

By 21 April, Soviet Marshal Georgi Zhukov&#x27;s 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the German lines on the Seelow Heights. Hitler, ignoring the facts, started to call the ragtag units that came under Steiner&#x27;s command, the Army Detachment Steiner (&quot;Armeeabteilung Steiner&quot;).

Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the huge salient that had been created by the 1st Belorussian Front&#x27;s breakout. Steiner&#x27;s attack was supposed to coincide with General Theodor Busse&#x27;s Ninth Army attacking from the south in a pincer attack. The Ninth Army had been pushed to south of the 1st Belorussian Front&#x27;s salient. To facilitate the attack, Steiner was assigned the three divisions of the Ninth Army&#x27;s CI Army Corps: the 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division &quot;Polizei&quot;, the 5th Jäger Division and the 25th Panzergrenadier Division. All three divisions were north of the Finow Canal on the Northern flank of Zhukov&#x27;s salient. General Helmuth Weidling&#x27;s LVI Panzer Corps, which was still east of Berlin with its northern flank just below Werneuchen, was also ordered to participate in the attack. The three divisions from CI Army Corps planned to attack south from Eberswalde on the Finow Canal towards the LVI Panzer Corps. The three divisions from CI Army Corps were 24 kilometres (about 15 miles) east of Berlin, and the attack to the south would cut the 1st Belorussian Front&#x27;s salient into two. Steiner called Heinrici and informed him that the plan could not be implemented because the 5th Jäger Division and the 25th Panzergrenadier Division were deployed defensively and could not be redeployed until the 2nd Naval Division arrived from the coast to relieve them. That left only two battalions of the 4th SS Panzergrenadier Division available, and they had no combat weapons.

Based on Steiner&#x27;s assessment, Heinrici called General Hans Krebs, Chief of Staff of the German General Staff of the Army High Command (&quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; or OKH), and told him that the plan could not be implemented. Heinrici asked to speak to Hitler but was told Hitler was too busy to take his call. On 22 April 1945, at his afternoon conference, Hitler, becoming aware that Steiner was not going to attack, fell into a tearful rage. Hitler finally declared that the war was lost, blamed the generals for the Reich&#x27;s defeat and announced that he would remain in Berlin until the end and then kill himself. On the same day, General Rudolf Holste was given the few mobile forces that Steiner commanded so that he could participate in a new plan to relieve Berlin. Holste was to attack from the north while General Walther Wenck attacked from the west and General Theodor Busse attacked from the south. The attacks amounted to little, and on 25 April, the Soviet forces attacking to the north and the south of Berlin linked up to the west of the city.

==Post-war==

After the surrender, Steiner was incarcerated until 1948. He faced charges at the Nuremberg Trials, but they were dropped and he was released.

In 1953, Steiner was recruited by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency to found the &quot;Gesellschaft für Wehrkunde&quot; (&quot;Society for Defense Studies&quot;), composed of former German military officers, as a propaganda tool and a military think tank for West German rearmament. With Paul Hausser, Herbert Gille and Otto Kumm, Steiner became a founding member of HIAG, the lobby group founded by former high-ranking Waffen-SS officers in West Germany in 1951.

Despite being an ardent German nationalist and veteran, he was not fanatical like Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke. In fact, when Ramcke began making truly odious comments to HIAG rallies, Steiner distanced himself from Ramcke.

From his home in West Germany he published &quot;Die Freiwilligen der Waffen-SS: Idee und Opfergang&quot; (&quot;The Volunteers of Waffen-SS: Idea and Sacrifice&quot;) in 1958. Steiner&#x27;s books and memoirs have been characterised by historian Charles Sydnor as one of the &quot;most important works of apologist literature,&quot; together with warfare analyses &quot;Grenadiere&quot; by Kurt Meyer and &quot;Waffen-SS in Action&quot; by Paul Hausser. These works demanded rehabilitation of the military branch of the NSDAP, with Steiner&#x27;s works being important in stressing the theme of the purely military Waffen-SS.

A second book was published in 1963 under the title &quot;Die Armee der Geächteten&quot; (English: &quot;The Army of the Outlaws&quot;) and was also tendentious.

Steiner died on 12 May 1966, 11 days before his 70th birthday.

<doc id="1113238" wikidata="Q2480980" url="?curid=1113238" title="Papillon Rose">
<text>is an anime series which parodies the magical girl genre, particularly &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and &quot;Cutie Honey&quot;. A 24-minute OVA was released in 2003 followed by a six-episode TV series, broadcast in Japan in 2006. A DVD collection containing the OVA and TV series was released in North America in 2010. The origin of this anime series is different from most other anime series&#x27; as it is based on an Internet hoax rather than a previously existing manga series.

==History==
&quot;Papillon Rose&quot; started out as a metafiction joke on what was claimed to be the website for a new anime project &quot;Lingerie Fighter Papillon Rose&quot;. The website posted pictures of characters (which were usually copied from scenes in &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, with the artwork changed) and a lyrics to opening and ending theme songs. Demand grew due to people finding the page and assuming it was for an actual series. Subsequently, an episode guide for the (non-existent) first series and manga was also made available, as well as a set of CD-ROMs containing a 2-minute animated promotional clip, eight tracks (six BGM and two vocal songs), system voice clips for computers, a &quot;Papillon Rose&quot; mahjong game, and two screen savers. The CDs were only made available for Comiket, and were not distributed outside Japan. The project homepage was redesigned and fake manga illustrations and notes from the fictional author were added. Amateur voice actors and singers were also contacted online to provide sample character voice clips for a handful of the villains and heroines. A 25-episode ONA series was promised in 2001 along with the release of an animated teaser trailer. Nothing other than the trailers were ever released online or elsewhere.
In January 2002, a second season concept was introduced, named &quot;Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose R&quot;, aiming to be released as an artbook on Comiket. In April 2004, a movie finale concept was introduced as well, named &quot;Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose G&quot;.
Subsequently, all of the project websites were either taken down or replaced with a blank page with the former content removed. There is no evidence that any fan-submitted material was ever used for either the OVA episode or the TV series.

In the fall of 2014, a blog was opened featuring new artwork for what claimed to be a new version of the &quot;Papillon Rose&quot; series, a rebuild of the original idea as a film trilogy. A new website was opened a few days afterwards, advertising a &quot;Papillon Rose&quot; booth in the 2015 Comiket. A new doujinshi artbook was released together with two pencil boards, featuring new artwork for the characters and a similar storyline to the original incarnation of the web series.

==&quot;Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose&quot; OVA 2003==
 was released as a single 24-minute OVA episode. This one-episode OVA was distributed on VHS and DVD formats by Pink company and Office F&amp;O in 2003.

This OVA episode is included in the 2010 North American DVD release with the six-episode &quot;Papillon Rose: The New Season&quot; TV series.

==&quot;Papillon Rose: The New Season&quot; TV series (2006)==
A six-episode TV series titled &quot;Papillon Rose: The New Season&quot; was broadcast in Japan in 2006. The TV series images and dialog are toned down considerably from the 2003 OVA. The TV series covers a time beginning a year after the ending of the OVA events and introduces new characters.

===Plot summary===

We find the girls in town going about their lives without any memories of their past exploits or ability to transform. Tsubomi is approached by Rama, the cat, whom, at first, she does not understand. But the Earth, specifically the Tokyo otaku district of Akiba, is under attack by a trio of powerful alien women along with their minions. The explosions around her restore her memories and she reassembles the rest of the Papillon team to defend the town. The Papillon team is reassembled and the enemies are won over by the team&#x27;s magical-girl powers and their &quot;charms&quot;.

==North American releases==
In March 2010, Section23 Films announced plans to release the six-episode TV series and the OVA on DVD for North America on behalf of Maiden Japan. The collection was released on June 8, 2010, on a single DVD titled &quot;Papillon Rose.&quot; This title was the first licensed by Maiden Japan for release in North America. It is in the Japanese language with English subtitles.

In January 2014 the six episodes of the TV series and the single OVA episode were posted on the Anime Network website for online streaming.

===Reception===
The North American DVD release was reviewed by Chris Beveridge on the popular media blog Mania.com and given an overall grade of B. He summarizes his review:
″Papillon Rose serves up just the right kind of parody of the Sailor Moon and magical girl world with this release. I do admittedly prefer the OVA more than the TV series because it&#x27;s concise and has a much dirtier mindset to it. The TV series tones things down for obvious reason but it still has a good deal of fun and manages to get dirty in its own way. This was the kind of show where its reputation certainly it and you always fear it may not live up to expectations. With the broadcast version of the TV series here, that&#x27;s a definitely downside. But for what we do get, it&#x27;s a lot of fun and a good way to spend an evening watching pretty anime girls doling out justice in a slight smutty way with smiles on their faces. It&#x27;s a title for discerning tastes, to say the least.″

<text>Stegodon (&quot;roofed tooth&quot; from the Ancient Greek words , , &#x27;to cover&#x27;, + , , &#x27;tooth&#x27; because of the distinctive ridges on the animal&#x27;s molars) is an extinct genus of proboscidean, related to elephants. It was originally assigned to the family Elephantidae along with modern elephants but is now placed in the extinct family Stegodontidae. Like elephants, &quot;Stegodon&quot; had teeth with plate-like lophs that are different from those of more primitive proboscideans like gomphotheres and mammutids. Fossils of the genus are known from Africa and across much of Asia, as far southeast as Timor (with a single record in southeast Europe). The oldest fossils of the genus are found in Late Miocene strata in Asia, likely originating from the more archaic &quot;Stegolophodon,&quot; subsequently migrating into Africa. While the genus became extinct in Africa during the Pliocene, &quot;Stegodon&quot; persisted in South, Southeast and Eastern Asia into the Late Pleistocene.

==Morphology==
The skull of &quot;Stegodon&quot; is relatively tall but short, and similar in many respects to those of living elephants. The lower jaw in comparison to early elephantimorphs and its ancestor &quot;Stegolophodon&quot; is shortened (brevirostrine), and lacks lower tusks/incisors. The molar teeth are superficially like those of elephants, consisting of parallel lamellae that form ridges but are generally relatively low crowned (brachydont), the numbers of ridges are greater in later species. Members of the genus lack permanent premolars. The tusks are proportionally large, with those of the biggest species being among the largest known tusks in proboscideans, with a particularly large tusk of &quot;S. ganesa&quot; from the Early Pleistocene of India measured to be long, with an estimated mass of approximately , substantially larger than the largest recorded modern elephant tusk. These tusks have a slight upward curvature, and project forwards and parallel to each other, with the tusks often so close together that they are almost touching, such that the trunk would probably have had to rest on top of the tusks rather than be freely hanging between them as in living elephants.

=== Size ===

The Chinese &quot;S. zdanskyi&quot; is suggested to be the largest species, and is known from an old male (50-plus years old) from the Yellow River that is tall and would have weighed approximately in life. It had a humerus long, a femur long, and a pelvis wide. The Indian &quot;S. ganesa&quot; is suggested to have a shoulder height of about , and a body mass of around . The Javanese species &quot;S. trigonocephalus&quot; is suggested to have been around tall, with a body mass of around . &quot;S. orientalis&quot; was around the size of an Asian elephant (&quot;Elephas&quot; &quot;maximus&quot;).
Similar to modern-day elephants, stegodonts were likely good swimmers, allowing them to disperse to remote islands in Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan. Once present on the islands, due to the process of insular dwarfism, as a result of decreased land area and the reduction of predation and competition pressure, they reduced in body size, with the degree of dwarfism varying between islands as the result of local conditions. One of the smallest species, &quot;Stegodon sumbaensis&quot; from Sumba in Indonesia, is estimated at around 8% of the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species, with a body mass of . Sometimes the same island was colonised multiple times by &quot;Stegodon,&quot; as in Flores, where the Early Pleistocene strongly dwarfed species &quot;Stegodon sondaari&quot;, which was tall at the shoulder and weighed about , was replaced by the species &quot;Stegodon florensis&quot; during the Middle Pleistocene which was initially substantially larger, but progressively reduced in size over time, with the earlier subspecies &quot;Stegodon florensis florensis&quot; from the Middle Pleistocene estimated to be around 50% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species with a shoulder height of around and a body mass of around 1.7 tons, while the later &quot;Stegodon florensis insularis&quot; from the Late Pleistocene is estimated to be around 17% the size of mainland &quot;Stegodon&quot; species, with a shoulder height of around , and a body mass of about .

During Pliocene-Early Pleistocene (from around 4-1 million years ago), a succession of endemic dwarf species of &quot;Stegodon,&quot; probably representing a single lineage lived in the Japanese archipelago, probably derived from the mainland Chinese &quot;S. zdanskyi.&quot; In chronological succession these species are &quot;Stegodon miensis&quot; (4-3 million years ago) &quot;Stegodon protoaurorae&quot; (3-2 million years ago) and &quot;Stegodon aurorae,&quot; (2-1 million years ago) which show a progressive size reduction through time, possibly as a result of reducing land area of the Japanese archipelago. The latest and smallest species &quot;S. aurorae&quot; is estimated to be 25% the size of its mainland ancestor with a body mass of around . &quot;S. aurorae&quot; also shows morphological straits associated with dwarfism, like shortened limbs.

== Ecology ==

Like modern elephants, but unlike more primitive proboscideans, &quot;Stegodon&quot; is thought to have chewed using a proal movement (a forward stroke from the back to the front) of the lower jaws. This jaw movement is thought to have evolved independently in elephants and stegodontids. &quot;Stegodon&quot; populations from the Late Pliocene of the India (including &quot;Stegodon insignis&quot;) are suggested to have been variable mixed feeders, while those from the earliest Pleistocene (including &quot;Stegodon ganesa&quot;) of the same region are suggested to have been nearly pure grazers based on isotopic analysis. Based on dental microwear analysis, populations of &quot;Stegodon&quot; from the Pleistocene of China (&quot;Stegodon orientalis&quot; and &quot;Stegodon huananensis&quot;) and mainland southeast Asia (&quot;S. orientalis&quot;) were found to be browsers, with clear niche differentiation from sympatric &quot;Elephas&quot; populations, which tended towards mixed feeding (both browsing and grazing), though isotopic analysis of &quot;Stegodon cf. orientalis&quot; specimens from the late Middle Pleistocene of Thailand suggests that these individuals were mixed feeders that consumed a significant amount of C grass. Specimens of &quot;Stegodon trigonocephalus&quot; from the Early-Middle Pleistocene of Java were found to be mixed feeders to grazers, with a diet similar to that of sympatric &quot;Elephas hysudrindicus&quot;. The dwarf species from Flores, &quot;Stegodon sondaari&quot; and &quot;Stegodon florensis&quot;, are suggested to have been mixed feeders and grazers, respectively, based on stable carbon isotopes. Specimens of &quot;Stegodon kaiesensis&quot; from the Pliocene of East Africa were found to be browsers to mixed feeders, based on mesowear analysis.

Tracks of a group of &quot;Stegodon&quot; from the Late Pliocene of Japan suggest that like modern elephants, &quot;Stegodon&quot; lived in social herds.

On Flores, where dwarf &quot;Stegodon&quot; species were the only large herbivores, they were likely the main prey of the Komodo dragon. 

== Taxonomy ==

In the past, stegodonts were believed to be the ancestors of the true elephants and mammoths, but currently they are believed to have no modern descendants. &quot;Stegodon&quot; is likely derived from &quot;Stegolophodon&quot;, an extinct genus known from the Miocene of Asia, with transitional fossils between the two genera known from the Late Miocene of Southeast Asia and Yunnan in South China. &quot;Stegodon&quot; is more closely related to elephants and mammoths than to mastodons. Like elephants, stegodontids are believed to have derived from gomphotheres.

===Phylogeny===
The following cladogram shows the placement of the genus &quot;Stegodon&quot; among other proboscideans, based on hyoid characteristics:

An indeterminate &quot;Stegodon&quot; molar of an uncertain locality and age is known from Greece, representing the only record of the genus in Europe. Indeterminate remains are also known from the Early Pleistocene and early Middle Pleistocene of Israel.

== Relationship with humans ==
Remains at a number of sites suggest that humans (in a broad sense, including archaic humans) interacted with &quot;Stegodon&quot;. At a cave deposit on Gele Mountain near Chongqing in southwest China, a mandible of &quot;Stegodon orientalis&quot; was used to make a handaxe, with dating suggesting the bone is around 170,000 years old. At the late Middle Pleistocene Panxian Dadong cave site in southern Guizhou Province, southwest China, dating to around 300-190,000 years ago, numerous remains of juvenile (0-12 years of age) and a much smaller number of adult remains of adult &quot;Stegodon orientalis&quot;, representing a minimum of 12 individuals were found at the site in association with stone tools and human remains. It suggested that &quot;Stegodon&quot; remains were brought to the cave by humans though none of the elements show clear evidence of processing. At the Xinlong Cave site in the Three Gorges area of Chongqing, suggested to date to around 200-130,000 years ago, two &quot;Stegodon&quot; cf. &quot;orientalis&quot; tusks have been found along with human remains. These tusks appear to have been delibrately engraved with patterns and are suggested to have been brought into the cave by humans. At the Late Pleistocene Ma’anshan site also in Guizhou, remains of &quot;Stegodon orientalis&quot; including both adults and juveniles among other animals are found in two layers, the older dating to around 53,000 years Before Present (BP), with the younger dates to around 19,295-31,155 years BP with the minimum number of individuals being 7 and 2 for the older and younger layers respectively, with the older layer containing adults and juveniles while in the younger later only juveniles are present. Bones at the site display cut marks indicating butchery, and are thought to have been accumulated at the site by people, likely by hunting or possibly scavenging in the case of the large adults found in the older layer.

At Liang Bua cave on Flores dating to around 80-50,000 years ago, remains of the dwarf &quot;Stegodon&quot; species &quot;Stegodon florensis&quot; are associated with stone tools produced by the dwarf archaic human species &quot;Homo floresiensis,&quot; with a small number of the bones bearing cut marks&quot;.&quot; The ambiguous circumstantial association between bones and stone tools, and the rarity of cut marks makes it unclear to what if to any degree, hunting of &quot;Stegodon&quot; was practiced by &quot;Homo floresiensis.&quot;

== Evolution and extinction ==
The oldest fossils of &quot;Stegodon&quot; in Asia date to the Late Miocene, around 8-11 million years ago, with the oldest fossils of the genus in Africa being around 7-6 million years old. &quot;Stegodon&quot; became extinct in Africa during the late Pliocene, around 3 million years ago suggested to be the result of expansion of grassland habitats. 

The Javanese species &quot;Stegodon trigonocephalus&quot; became extinct around 130-80,000 years ago during the latest Middle Pleistocene-early Late Pleistocene (Marine Isotope Stage 5) following a change to more humid conditions, which may have reduced grazing habitat. The last records of &quot;Stegodon florensis&quot; date to around 50,000 years ago, around the time of arrival of modern humans to Flores (the earliest evidence of which dates to 46,000 years ago), suggesting that effects of modern human activity were likely the cause of their extinction. 

&quot;Stegodon&quot; became extinct in the Indian subcontinent (&quot;Stegodon namadicus&quot;/&quot;Stegodon&quot; sp&quot;.),&quot; mainland Southeast Asia and China (&quot;S. orientalis&quot;) at some point during the Late Pleistocene epoch, while Asian elephants, which existed in sympatry with &quot;Stegodon&quot; in these regions, are still extant. The precise timing of extinction is uncertain for these regions, though in India records of &quot;Stegodon&quot; may date as recently as 35-30,000 years ago. The survival of the Asian elephant as opposed to &quot;Stegodon orientalis&quot; in Southeast Asia and South China has been suggested to be due to its more flexible diet in comparison to &quot;S. orientalis&quot;. Although some authors have claimed a Holocene survival in China for &quot;S. orientalis,&quot; these claims cannot be substantiated due to loss of specimens and issues regarding dating.

<text>Kevin Peter Hall (May 9, 1955 – April 10, 1991) was an American actor. Hall stood tall, and frequently played monster characters. He was the original title monster in the science fiction &quot;Predator&quot; franchise, appearing in the first 1987 film and its 1990 sequel. Hall also portrayed the eponymous Harry in the fantasy comedy film &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (1987), a role he reprised for the first season of the syndicated television adaptation (1990–1991). His human roles included Dr. Elvin &quot;El&quot; Lincoln on the NBC science fiction series &quot;Misfits of Science&quot; (1985–1986) and Warren Merriwether on the sitcom &quot;227&quot; (1989–1990).

== Early life ==
Hall was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Hall came from a tall family. His father, Charles Hall, stood , and his mother, Sylvia, stood . At , Hall was the tallest of his brothers, all of whom were at least tall.

During his high school years at Penn Hills High School, he was a star basketball player. He subsequently attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C., where he played for its basketball team and majored in theatrical arts.

After graduation, Hall moved to Venezuela to play professional basketball.

== Career ==
Due to Hall&#x27;s height, he was often cast in monster roles. He made his acting debut in the 1979 horror film &quot;Prophecy&quot;. He appeared as the alien in the 1980 horror film &quot;Without Warning&quot; and as Gorvil in the 1982 television movie &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot;. In 1985, he co-starred in the short-lived series &quot;Misfits of Science&quot;. He guest-starred on the sitcom &quot;Night Court&quot; as a huge but gentle mental patient who humorously towered over bailiff Bull Shannon, played by Richard Moll, who was , and a fellow mental patient, played by James Cromwell, who is . The next year, Hall portrayed yet another monster in the horror film &quot;Monster in the Closet&quot;, followed by the role of Harry, the Bigfoot, in &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;.

In 1986, Hall was cast as the main antagonist and titular monster in &quot;Predator&quot;, opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger, Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura. During its developmental stages, the Predator was going to be played by Jean-Claude Van Damme, who played the Predator for the first few scenes, but was uncredited in the end credits. The producers decided to recast the role with Hall so that the Predator could more convincingly dominate the film&#x27;s human characters with its greater size. Hall also appeared unmasked as a helicopter pilot at the end of the film. Hall would go on to reprise the role in the 1990 sequel, this time opposite Danny Glover and Gary Busey.

Following his role in &quot;Predator&quot;, Hall appeared in the feature film &quot;Big Top Pee-wee&quot; (1988) and had a guest spot on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;; Hall had been one of the actors considered for the role of Geordi La Forge on the latter, before the role went to LeVar Burton. From 1989 to 1990, he had a recurring role on the NBC sitcom &quot;227&quot;. In 1990, Hall reprised his role as Harry in the television series &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;, based on the 1987 film of the same name. He died during the series&#x27; first season.

==Personal life and death==
Hall met actress Alaina Reed while taping a guest role on the television show &quot;227&quot;. The couple would marry both on the show and in real life.

While working on the TV series &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot;, Hall announced that he had contracted HIV from a blood transfusion during surgery for injuries he sustained in a car accident. He died from AIDS-related pneumonia on April 10, 1991, a month short of his 36th birthday.

==Honors==
Hall was posthumously inducted into the Penn Hills Hall of Fame as part of the inaugural class on May 8, 2009.

<text>Fairfield is a suburb of Western Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Being in the centre of the Cumberland Plain, Fairfield is located west of the Sydney central business district and is the administrative heart of the Fairfield City Council (local government area) – despite a very small portion of it belonging to the Cumberland Council. Fairfield supports a mixture of commercial and residential developments, mostly characterised by medium-density buildings and some new high-rise apartments.

Fairfield is one of the most multicultural and culturally diverse cities in Australia, with more than half of the residents having been born overseas, mostly in non-English speaking countries. The majority of the suburb&#x27;s dwellers speak a language other than English at home, with the two most common ones being Arabic and Assyrian Neo-Aramaic. Fairfield is an ethnic enclave of Assyrian Christians (mostly from Iraq, and more recently Syria). Fairfield&#x27;s large Iraqi and Assyrian community has had the media describe the suburb as Little Iraq or Little Assyria.

==History==
For more than 30,000 years, Aboriginal people from the Cabrogal-Gandangara tribe have lived in the Fairfield area.

===European settlement, 1780s–1810s===
The earliest recorded white settlement in the Fairfield district is described in William Bradley&#x27;s Journal where he noted an expedition from Rose Hill to Prospect Creek to determine whether Prospect Creek led to Botany Bay. Bradley described a place on the Creek where the water changed from fresh to salt with a drop of . The presence of salt water confirmed Prospect Creek&#x27;s connection to the sea. 

Gabriel Louis Marie Huon de Kerrileau, a Breton soldier in the NSW Corps arrived in the colony in 1794, having fled France during the French Revolution. In 1807 he received a grant of in the centre of Fairfield, which he named &quot;Castel Paul&quot;. This was an Englished form of the town in which he was born in Brittany, Kastell-Paol, Saint-Pol-de-Léon in French. By 1814 &quot;Castel Paul&quot; had been combined, by subsequent owners, with several similarly sized grants to form a largely uncleared estate.

===Early development, 1820s–1920s===
The free settler John Horsley purchased the estate in that year and named it &quot;Mark Lodge&quot;, after family properties in Essex, England. Horsley, a Magistrate and Coroner at Liverpool (1825-1834), and his large family were among the pioneers of white settlement in the Fairfield District. Later, a Colonial Treasurer, Thomas Ware Smart (1810–1881) bought the estate and in the 1860s built the mansion, &#x27;Fairfield House&#x27;. 

Fairfield railway station was opened in 1856 and has the oldest surviving railway building in New South Wales. Development began in the mid 19th century supported by railway construction in 1856. The railway aided with the enlargement of local industries including timber, fruit development and agricultural produce. Around the start of the 20th century the area had a population of 2,500 people and with fertile soils, produced crops for distribution in Sydney. Electricity was connected in 1921.

===Post-war period, 1940s–1980s===
Rapid population increase after World War II saw the settlement of many ex-service men and European migrants, with Ware Street becoming the new main street, which featured the city&#x27;s only escalator. The street at that time featured prominent hardware, furniture, menswear and homeware stores, including a Bing Lee. Large scale Housing Commission development in the 1950s swelled the population to 38,000. The Civic Centre was established in the 1960s in Spencer Street and featured many businesses, including the nearby Civic Hotel. Fairfield Hospital was opened in September 1956 on The Horsley Drive, but was relocated to Prairiewood in 1988.

By 1979, the population had reached 120,000 and the city was becoming one of the larger Local Government Areas in New South Wales. In the early 1980s, Fairfield Forum was opened and Ware Street was shut for traffic, with a pedestrian zone established in its stead with a water fountain imported from Italy being the ornament of the civic area. However, the pedestrian plaza was deemed unsuccessful, despite the annual street parades occurring there, and thus Ware Street once again was open to traffic.

===Rapid growth, 1980s–present===
During the mid to late 1980s Iran–Iraq War, large number of Assyrians fled Iraq and settled in Fairfield, making it the most popular settlement for Assyrians. In 1990, Neeta City was opened due to the rapid growth of Fairfield&#x27;s commercial centre. An amphitheatre situated in Spencer Street with chess board was closed in the early 2000s with the street reopening to traffic. In the mid-2000s, Fairfield&#x27;s first high rise apartment building (around 9 to 11 storeys) was constructed, with a number of other high rise buildings which were built consequentially throughout the city centre.

In 2015, the Abbott government granted 12,000 extra humanitarian visas to persecuted groups in the war-torn Middle Eastern countries, namely Syria. The Department of Social Services confirmed that 11,400 Iraqi and Syrian refugees (many of whom being Assyrian) were admitted to Australia as part of its one-off humanitarian intake, with half of them primarily settling in Fairfield and also Liverpool. Fairfield City
accommodated 3,000 humanitarian arrivals in 2016, taking in 75% of all western Sydney&#x27;s refugee intake, with Liverpool City Council second at 14%. Fairfield City Centre today features a concoction of retail, commercial and residential developments, including medium density edifices and medium to high-rise shop-top housing developments.

In July 2021, Fairfield was one of the &quot;suburbs of concern&quot; and became a hotspot due to rising COVID-19 cases in the region that resulted in a strict lockdown in the area, transforming the CBD into a ghost town, with heavy police patrol compliance checks. Fines were issued for those who did not comply with the state public health order. Workers from Fairfield were ordered to stay at home by NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian unless they had leave the house for emergency reasons or that they had produced a negative COVID-19 test.

==Commercial area==

Fairfield consists of a combination of main street retail centred in Smart and Ware Streets, arcade and larger shopping centres, with a variety of activities including retail, café/restaurant/take away foods, supermarkets (with some displayed in a bazaar-style environment), personal services and commercial uses. Fairfield does not feature a formal ‘City Square’, though &quot;The Crescent Plaza&quot;, and &quot;Thomas Ware Plaza&quot; in Nelson Street, provide a similar sense of fashion to a City Square. Although most of these commercial precincts are not a leading part of Fairfield&#x27;s night time attribute at present, wedding receptions, however, do prevail night activity on the weekends. 

A couple of shop fronts along The Crescent are in the Federation and Art Deco style, which date from the late 1890s to 1920s, respectively, reflecting its former role as an early main street. The CBD is surrounded by a halo of three-storey residential flats, which are beneficial for pedestrian activity to the City Centre. The community holds public gathering and interaction in a high regard, which is manifested by the CBD&#x27;s active shopping streets and daily social assemblage for playing chess on Kenyon Street.

Fairfield has three shopping malls which were established between the 1980s and early 1990s. The two largest are the &quot;Fairfield Forum&quot; and &quot;Neeta City&quot; (later renamed to &quot;Fairfield City Central&quot;) and the smaller &quot;Fairfield Chase&quot;. Forum contains Kmart, Aldi and Coles. Fairfield City Central, formerly Neeta City (name changed in late 2021), features a Woolworths supermarket. The &quot;Fairfield Chase Commercial Tower&quot; was Fairfield&#x27;s first high-rise structure. It has a lower level of commercial shops, a medical centre and food outlets open to the public while the higher levels function as private office building spaces are occupied by government agencies such as Legal Aid NSW, the NSW Service for Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors and private companies such as a child care centre and employment agencies. The Crescent, Nelson, Ware and Nelson Streets are ornamented by a number of London planes.

==Culture==

A cinema at Fairfield Forum was opened as &#x27;Hoyts Forum Twin&#x27; on 17 March 1983 with around 400 seating. In 1992, the complex was renamed Fairfield Cinema, with a third screen installed in 1996. In 2006, it was reestablished as the World Cinemas (primarily exhibiting Bollywood films). The cinema was altogether closed in 2010 and its site became a fitness/gym centre.

‘Fairfield’ has been synonymised with ‘Assyrian’, as people overseas have been familiar with its Assyrian culture. Iraqi and Assyrian businesses have opened in Fairfield, mostly around Ware Street. These businesses include everything from jewellery shops to restaurants, making the area favourite entertainment and shopping hotspot for the Iraqi and Assyrian community. Elderly Assyrian men gather daily to play dominoes in the outdoor tables, which are printed with chess board. Fairfield&#x27;s culturally diverse population is reflected in multicultural local businesses such as over twenty different types of cafés and restaurants that include Assyrian, Iraqi, Italian, Chinese, Lebanese, Vietnamese, South American and Thai cuisine.

Sydney&#x27;s Iraqi community congregated in Fairfield to celebrate Iraq qualifying for the Asian Football Cup finals in 2007. More than 7000 people joined in street celebrations around Fairfield on Sunday 29 July 2007 after Iraq won the Asian Cup finals. Similar events took place in January 2023 when Iraq won the 25th Arabian Gulf Cup by defeating Oman in the final, 3-2 in extra time with Iraq scoring the winning goal deep into stoppage time of the 2nd half of extra time.

There is a 1,000 sqm public library in Hamilton Road, which was previously located in Kenyon Street. Fairfield has a few Assyrian churches, sporting clubs, cultural associations and health groups.

===Heritage===

The &quot;School of Arts Building&quot;, established in the late 19th century, is a social and historical significance and is an example of Victorian and Federation period styles which are uncommon
in the suburb. The &quot;Uniting Church&quot; is made up of two churches – One of which was built in 1894 and the other in 1927. The first fire brigade built in the city, the Fire Station in William Street, is a free classical style building and is also a historical significance. A federation weatherboard cottage located in Lawson Street was established in around 1910.

Made up of two red brick entrance pillars, Honour Avenue was built in honour of the Fairfield residents who served in the World Wars and it includes the names of World War II personnel. Its connecting metal arch exhibits the words: &#x27;1939 Honour Avenue 1945&#x27;. The avenue therein contains large brush boxes on both sides and public seating.

Fairfield has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Great Southern railway: Fairfield railway station, Sydney, the oldest Railway Station in New South Wales and one of the oldest groups of buildings in Fairfield City, which are Mid-Victorian, Georgian Style public buildings dating back to 1856.

The &quot;International Monument&quot; in The Crescent Park was built as a symbol of Fairfield&#x27;s migrant population in 1968. It was designed by Leonid Denysenko and Yurij Denysenko. The letter &quot;A&quot; represents Australia and also Mount Ararat. Originally, the monument had water gushing from the middle in the form of a waterfall. The angular object above symbolises a boat or a plane, while the hole in the middle symbolises the opening where migrants exit to colonise the new land. The nearby LJ Clock Tower was erected in 1958.

===Media===
Fairfield has two local newspapers, The &quot;Fairfield Advance&quot; and the &quot;Fairfield Champion&quot;, which are issued every Wednesday. &quot;Fairfield Local News&quot; is an online, independent local news source for those who reside in the Fairfield area. 2GLF is a community radio station that caters to the communities of Liverpool and Fairfield LGA&#x27;s.

==Transport==

Fairfield railway station is on the Old Main South. Trains run frequently from Fairfield to Leppington, Parramatta and the City Circle. Fairfield also has a major bus interchange adjacent to the railway station. For details of bus services from the interchange see Fairfield railway station. The Horsley Drive is a prominent road in Fairfield, with a high amount of traffic, and acts as a pivotal entrance to the city from the north and southeast. Hamilton Road to the southwest is another.

==Schools==
Public schools in Fairfield include Fairfield High School and Fairfield Public School. Private Schools include Patrician Brothers&#x27; College and Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School, which are both catholic schools. Patrician Brothers&#x27; Primary School was also previously located in Fairfield but closed in 2006. Alternative High Schools for students who have been expelled or unfit for mainstream include Indie School - Fairfield campus, and Warakirri College - Fairfield campus.

==Geography==

Much of the original bushland cover within the city has been cleared through past land management practices. A few small areas of this original bushland remain, including examples of Cumberland Plain vegetation and Cooks River/Castlereagh Ironbark Forest, which are listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act. The Australian white ibis are specifically present in The Crescent, opposite of the train station.

Eight creeks, 80 kilometres in length, have their headwaters in Fairfield City and flow into the Georges River and Hawkesbury Nepean catchments. The impact of development over the past 50 years has resulted in severe degradation of the natural habitat in the creek banks and water quality has been assessed as very poor in recent years. Strategies are being implemented so that this trend is being reversed. Air quality in the city is heavily impacted upon by an insufficiently integrated public transport system, creating an over reliance upon private vehicles for moving people and freight.

===Climate===
Fairfield has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;). Summer weather may come from north-east (humid) or the north west (dry). Fairfield is usually a few degrees warmer than Sydney on summer days and a few degrees cooler on winter nights. There could be a temperature differential of 5 degrees Celsius in summer due to sea breezes in the City that don&#x27;t generally penetrate inland, and in extreme cases there could be a 10 degrees differential. It receives less annual rain than Sydney CBD by about 400mm. Late winter and early spring receive the least rainfall, whilst late summer and autumn receive more rain.

<text>Apple Productivity Experience Group (known as APEX) is an operating unit of Microsoft that, as of 2009, is the largest software developer outside of Apple Inc. for the macOS and iOS operating systems. Formed as Macintosh Business Unit on January 7, 1997, it was initially composed of over 100 individuals from the existing cross platform Word, Excel, and PowerPoint teams in Microsoft&#x27;s Office Division, and grew to 180 people the next year, with the addition of the Internet Explorer for Mac and Outlook Express for Mac teams. In 2000, it moved from the Office Division to the Specialized Devices and Applications Group inside the Entertainment and Devices Division, and is now back inside the Microsoft Office division.

== History ==

Prior to the creation of the Mac BU, Microsoft had developed Macintosh software, starting in 1984 with Word 1.0 for Macintosh. During the early and mid 1990s, Microsoft&#x27;s Word, Excel, and Powerpoint teams simultaneously developed Windows and Macintosh versions of these applications, but after releasing Office 97 for Windows, Microsoft decided, in January 1997, to form a separate Macintosh Business Unit to focus on creating applications optimized for the Macintosh platform. In August 1997, as part of a broader partnership agreement with Apple, Microsoft committed to continue developing and supporting Macintosh software for at least 5 more years, renewing this pledge on January 10, 2006, at the Macworld Conference &amp; Expo. Ben Waldman was the Mac BU&#x27;s founder and first General Manager (GM), serving from its inception in January 1997 through January 2000, when he was succeeded by Kevin Browne, who served through December 18, 2002, and Roz Ho, who served from December 18, 2002, to June 8, 2007; after that, Craig Eisler became the GM. In October 2008, Eisler was tapped by Robbie Bach to lead all Entertainment Client efforts, and Eric Wilfred became the GM of MacBU.

== Software ==
APEX develops macOS and iOS versions of Microsoft Office and OneNote. Previously developed software by the Mac BU include Internet Explorer (development ceased in 2003), Virtual PC, and the MSN for Mac OS X browser (cancelled May 31, 2005).

<doc id="1113265" wikidata="Q1686219" url="?curid=1113265" title="Robert Swenson">
<text>Robert Alexander &quot;Jeep&quot; Swenson Jr. (January 5, 1957 - August 18, 1997) was an American professional wrestler, stuntman and actor.

==Career==

===Wrestling===
Swenson wrestled for World Class Championship Wrestling in 1987 and 1988 as Jeep Swenson for manager Gary Hart. He debuted on March 7, 1987, defeating Perry Jackson in a 2-minute challenge match. His main feud was with Bruiser Brody, who was wrestling as the masked &quot;Red River Jack&quot;. Brody defeated him at the Parade of Champions 1987 event. According to Swenson, he had the largest biceps in the world at that time (they were recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records). From 1993 to 1994, he wrestled for Global Wrestling Federation in Texas, where he feuded with Ahmed Johnson.

Swenson returned to wrestling for a match at World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s Uncensored pay-per-view on March 24, 1996. He performed as a member of the &quot;Alliance to End Hulkamania&quot;. He was named The Final Solution, but following complaints from Jewish organizations to the Turner corporate offices, his character was renamed The Ultimate Solution. WCW claimed they were unaware that The Final Solution was the name Adolf Hitler gave to his plan to destroy the Jews. The Alliance consisted of the Dungeon of Doom, the Four Horsemen, The Ultimate Solution and Z-Gangsta, working to end Hulk Hogan&#x27;s career.

===Boxing===
Swenson boxed as an amateur middleweight and later had a short career as a professional boxer. He won his first two bouts by knockouts, but his third fight was stopped in round one after Frankie Garcia knocked him down twice in his pro debut.

===Acting===

Swenson&#x27;s first role was as an uncredited thug in early Jackie Chan movie The Big Brawl. Swenson also appeared as pit fighter &quot;Lugwrench&quot; Perkins in the 1989 Hulk Hogan film &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;. He played the masked version of Dorian in the 1994 film &quot;The Mask&quot;. He also played James Caan&#x27;s bodyguard Bledsoe in the Damon Wayans and Adam Sandler film &quot;Bulletproof&quot;, before playing possibly his best known character Bane in the critically panned 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;. His actual blood vessels were outlined in ink for “Batman” by the makeup experts at Warner Bros. He was also featured in many magazines and television commercials.

==Personal life==
Swenson was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Patricia Maxine (née Wells) and Robert Alexander Swenson Sr. His nickname, &quot;Jeep&quot;, was derived from his dad (a soldier known as &quot;Tank&quot;), whose logic was that every tank needed a Jeep. He was married to Erin Hillsman; the couple had a daughter named Kayleigh, who is a model and music composer and goes by the name Viking Barbie.

==Death==
On August 18, 1997, Swenson died of a heart attack at the UCLA Medical Center at the age of 40. Hulk Hogan, Davey Boy Smith, and James Caan gave eulogies at his funeral. He was an avid user of steroids and started to use them in his early 20s. Because of this, he reportedly could not shower properly, put on a shirt, or walk upstairs. His death also shocked George Clooney, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Uma Thurman, his co-stars in the &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; film. After the funeral, Swenson was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in an undisclosed location.

<doc id="1113267" wikidata="Q7873627" url="?curid=1113267" title="USS S-32">
<text>USS &quot;S-32&quot; (SS-137) was an &quot;S&quot;-class submarine of the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;S-32&quot; was laid down on 12 April 1918 by the Union Iron Works in San Francisco, California. She was launched on 11 January 1919, sponsored by Miss Margaret Tynan, and commissioned on 15 June 1922.

==Service history==
===1922–1941===
Soon after commissioning, &quot;S-32&quot;, assigned to Submarine Division 17 and home-ported at San Pedro, California, was ordered to New London, Connecticut. She was decommissioned there on 25 September 1922 and, after engineering alterations by the prime contractor, the Electric Boat Company, and the engineering sub-contractor, the New London Ship and Engine Company, she was recommissioned on 21 February 1923. Temporary duty with Submarine Division 11 then took her south to the Caribbean Sea and the Panama Canal Zone for 1923 winter exercises with the Fleet, after which she rejoined the S-boats of her division, now designated Submarine Division 16, and returned to San Pedro.

During the summer of 1923, she participated in cold-weather exercises in the Aleutian Islands. In the fall of 1923, she resumed local operations off Southern California, and during the winter of 1923–1924 she returned to the Panama Canal Zone. In April 1924, she moved back to San Pedro, from which she operated until 1925. Early in 1925, her division was transferred to the United States Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines, and its submarines shifted to Mare Island, California, to prepare for the trans-Pacific crossing.

On 15 April 1925, &quot;S-32&quot; departed San Francisco for the Philippines. She arrived at Cavite on Luzon in mid-summer 1925 and through the winter of 1926 conducted local exercises in the Luzon area. In the spring of 1926 she deployed to the coast of China, conducting exercises both en route to and from her summer base, the former Imperial German Navy base at Tsingtao. Overhaul followed her September 1926 return to the Philippines. She repeated this annual employment schedule for the next six years.

In 1932, Submarine Division 16 was transferred to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. &quot;S-32&quot; departed Manila Bay on 2 May 1932 and, at arrived at Pearl Harbor at the end of May 1932. Pearl Harbor was her home port for the next five years.

In June 1937, &quot;S032&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the United States East Coast. In August 1937, she reported for inactivation at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and on 7 December 1937 she was decommissioned and berthed at League Island in Philadelphia.

In the summer of 1940, &quot;S-32&quot; began reactivation. Recommissioned on 18 September 1940 and assigned to Submarine Division 52, &quot;S-32&quot; conducted trials from New London through November 1940 and, in December 1940, proceeded to the Panama Canal Zone, from which she operated until April 1941. She then returned to New London but, toward the end of April 1941, she moved to Bermuda. Through May 1941, she patrolled and conducted training exercises out of the base at St. George, Bermuda, that the United States had acquired from the United Kingdom in the Destroyers for Bases Agreement of 2 September 1940.

In late June 1941, &quot;S-32&quot; returned to New London and resumed exercises. In September 1941, she moved to Philadelphia for an overhaul and, by December 1941, she was back at New London.

=== World War II ===
==== First, second, and third war patrols ====

The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II on 7 December 1941, and early in 1942 &quot;S-32&quot; received orders to return to the Panama Canal Zone. She arrived at Coco Solo, Panama, in February 1942. During the spring of 1942, she conducted two defensive war patrols in the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.

On 3 June 1942, the Aleutian Islands campaign began with the Battle of Dutch Harbor, followed quickly by the Japanese occupation of Attu and Kiska. In June 1942, &quot;S-32&quot; proceeded to San Diego, California, en route to the Aleutian Islands. In early July 1942, she arrived at Dutch Harbor on Amaknak Island off Unalaska in the Aleutians, and on 7 July 1942 she departed Dutch Harbor on her first offensive war patrol and third patrol overall. She patrolled the fog-covered waters of the Rat Islands and Amchitka into August 1942, then shifted to an area north of Attu. She returning to Dutch Harbor on 10 August 1942.

==== Fourth war patrol ====

On 22 August 1942, &quot;S-32&quot; departed Dutch Harbor on her fourth war patrol. Moving westward, she hunted for Japanese ships in the sea lanes between Kiska and Attu during the first week of the patrol. On 28 August, leaks developed in her after trim tank, but her crew compensated for them by placing of water in the forward trim tanks. Although this meant that space was left to accommodate water for only one torpedo reload, &quot;S-32&quot;′s crew regained depth control, and with fuel suction shifted forward, reload capability slowly improved.

On 29 August 1942, &quot;S-32&quot; was off Amchitka to check for Japanese shipping in sheltered areas on Amchitka&#x27;s north coast. On 31 August 1942, she headed east to cover the Allied occupation of Adak Island. On 14 September 1942, she returned to the junction of Rat Island and Amchitka, where she continued her patrol for another six days. On 20 September 1942, she headed for Dutch Harbor, which she reached on 23 September 1942.

==== Fifth war patrol ====

&quot;S-32&quot; departed Dutch Harbor on 8 October 1942 to begin her fifth war patrol. During a trim dive, her crew discovered a fuel shortfall of about caused by the presence of water in the line during fueling at Dutch Harbor. As a result, she ran out of reserve fuel in the number three main ballast tank on 12 October 1942, but she nonetheless continued west to a patrol area in the Kuril Islands.

On 17 October 1942, &quot;S-32&quot; arrived off Paramushiro at the northern end of the Kurils, and that evening she took up station off the southeast coast of the island to patrol the entrances to Musashi Bay and Onekotan Strait. On the morning of 18 October 1942, she sighted two ships at anchor in Musashi Bay, and, after a periscope check disclosed no other ships in the area, she began working her way to an attack position west or southwest of the ships. Moving slowly through the calm and poorly charted bay with only short and infrequent periscope exposures, she went up for a final check at 10:23. While looking, she struck an uncharted sand bar. &quot;S-32&quot;, her torpedo tubes ready for firing, angled up 10 degrees. Her depth gauge showed . During the next few seconds she slid over the bar, apparently showing her periscope shears, bow, and possibly her whole bridge structure above water; then, over the bar, she took a down angle at high speed. At 10:25, she fired two torpedoes set to run at a depth of at each of the ships. On firing the fourth and final torpedo, she changed course and maneuvered at high speed toward the open sea. Her crew heard two explosions as she cleared the immediate area.

At 10:45, &quot;S-32&quot; came to periscope depth to observe the damage. One of the ships was afire amidships and had settled somewhat; she was anchored in shallow water and might have been resting on the bottom. The second ship was obscured by the first. &quot;S-32&quot; went to and proceeded out of the bay. At 12:05, she resumed her patrol east of Onekotan Strait. That evening, she began her return voyage to the Aleutians, and on 27 October 1942 she arrived at Dutch Harbor.

==== November 1942–February 1943 ====
From Dutch Harbor, &quot;S-32&quot; returned to San Diego, which she reached on 11 November 1942. An overhaul there followed, and from 21 to 25 December 1942 she tested newly installed equipment — a fathometer, radar, and keel-mounted sound gear. From 28 December 1942 to 26 January 1943, she provided services to the West Coast Sound School. On 6 February 1943, she headed north toward Dutch Harbor.

==== Sixth war patrol ====

&quot;S-32&quot; departed Dutch Harbor on her sixth war patrol on 25 February 1943. En route to her assigned patrol area off Attu, she encountered very rough seas, strong winds, rain, mist, and fog. On 26 February 1943, she rolled as much as 65 degrees to starboard.

Progress west was slow, but, on 1 March 1943 she set a course toward Holtz Bay on the northeast coast of Attu to check for Japanese shipping there. On 2 March 1943, heavy mist and fog hindered her reconnaissance of Stellar Cove, but she turned to the shipping lanes along the coast of Attu to intercept Japanese ships between Cape Wrangell and Holtz Bay. The entrances to Holtz Bay, Chichagof Harbor, and Sarana Bay, were her primary hunting grounds. On the night of 9 March 1942, off Holtz Bay, she attacked and damaged an Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer, then underwent a brief depth charging. The depth charging caused leaks, but her crew minimized them, and &quot;S-32&quot; continued her patrol.

Four nights later, on 13 March 1943, &quot;S-32&quot; attacked Japanese submarine which was lying to on the surface with her engines smoking north of Holtz Bay. At 20:59, &quot;S-32&quot; launched two torpedoes at the Japanese submarine at ten-second intervals. At 21:00, she went deep, and as she passed , one torpedo exploded. At 21:20, &quot;S-32&quot; came to periscope depth, but fog had closed in and the Japanese submarine was no longer visible.

On the afternoon of 15 March 1943, &quot;S-32&quot; sighted another Japanese submarine. For the first time during &quot;S-32&quot;′s patrol, according to her crew, the weather was &quot;perfect for a periscope approach.&quot; At 17:27, &quot;S-32&quot; fired a three-torpedo spread and an estimated range of with a track angle favorable. About two and a half minutes later, crewmen in &quot;S-32&quot;′s torpedo room heard a muffled explosion, but her fire control control party heard nothing. &quot;S-32&quot; went to periscope depth and observed smoke was pouring skyward from the Japanese submarine&#x27;s conning tower. Her crew took a periscope photograph of the scene as the damaged Japanese submarine headed for the nearest beach. At 17:36, however, the Japanese submarine disappeared from view. &quot;S-32&quot;′s sound operated reported that the Japanese submarine′s screws had stopped.

&quot;S-32&quot; departed the Attu area early on the morning of 17 March 1943. On 20 March 1943, she moored at Dutch Harbor.

==== Seventh war patrol ====
On 29 March 1943, &quot;S-32&quot; again departed Dutch Harbor and headed west for her seventh war patrol. En route to Attu, cold weather caused icing on her superstructure, but the seas remained fairly calm and the sun was occasionally visible. On 3 April 1943, however, as she approached Attu, more normal Aleutian weather closed in. From then to 16 April 1943, snow and rain storms were almost continuous, seas were rough, winds were strong, and periods of sunlight were limited.

At 01:57 on 10 April 1943, while patrolling on a north-south line off Holtz Bay, &quot;S-32&quot; picked up a target on radar some away. At 02:07, &quot;S-32&quot;′s radar detected a second, smaller ship ahead of the first target. At 02:12, &quot;S-32&quot; sighted the first ship at a range of about . She launched four torpedoes. Her crew heard two very loud explosions followed by distant rumblings. At 02:19, at a range of just over , all traces of the ships disappeared from &quot;S-32&quot;′s radar screen.

On 16 April 1943, &quot;S-32&quot; set a course for Dutch Harbor. On 20 April 1943, she arrived and commenced refit.

==== Eighth war patrol ====

On 4 May 1943, &quot;S-32&quot; again sailed west to commence her eighth and final war patrol. En route to the Kurils, she patrolled across possible Japanese reinforcement routes to Kiska and Attu, but almost zero visibility during the passage hindered hunting, an on 11 May 1943 her radar broke down. On 12 May 1943, she entered her assigned area off Paramushiro. On 13 May 1943, she obtained her first navigational fix, off Onekotan, and commenced patrolling across the approaches to Onekotan Strait and Musashi Bay. Visibility remained poor, and seas were rough. Her radar functioned improperly throughout her short time on station. On 15 May 1943, the port main motor armature developed a zero resistance to ground. Repeated repair attempts failed, and the motor was secured. &quot;S-32&quot; turned back toward Dutch Harbor, where she moored on 23 May 1943.

==== May 1943–September 1945 ====
On 27 May, &quot;S-32&quot; departed the Aleutians for the last time. On 6 June 1943 she arrived at San Diego, where she provided training services for the remainder of World War II. Hostilities ended in mid-August 1945, and shortly thereafter &quot;S-32&quot; was designated for inactivation. She arrived at San Francisco on 13 September 1945.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;S-32&quot; was decommissioned at Mare Island on 19 October 1945. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1945, and her hulk was sold for scrapping in May 1946 to the Learner Company of Oakland, California.

==Awards and honors==

* American Defense Service Medal
* American Campaign Medal
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with five battle stars 
* World War II Victory Medal

&quot;S-32&quot;&#x27;s five battle stars for her service in World War II was the highest number of battle stars earned by an S-class submarine.

<doc id="1113268" wikidata="Q5095468" url="?curid=1113268" title="Chicago 13">
<text>Chicago 13 is the eleventh studio album by American rock band Chicago, released on August 13, 1979, by Columbia Records. &quot;Chicago 13&quot; was the band&#x27;s final release with guitarist Donnie Dacus, who had followed founding member, guitarist Terry Kath, after his death. All band members contributed to the songwriting (one of only two albums where this is the case, the other being &quot;Chicago VII&quot;).

==Background==
After recording sessions in Morin-Heights, Quebec and Hollywood, &quot;Chicago 13&quot;—which saw the band return to numbering its albums (the first album to use an Arabic numeral in its numbering) and displaying its logo—was released in August 1979, and was preceded by Donnie Dacus&#x27;s &quot;Must Have Been Crazy&quot; as lead single. &quot;Chicago 13&quot; is the first Chicago album to bear no significant hit singles.

Despite negative reviews, &quot;Chicago 13&quot; reached No. 21 and went gold, although it was the band&#x27;s first album to miss the Top 20 and was then the lowest charting release since their debut album. Shortly after the tour to support the album ended, Dacus was fired from the band without explanation.

In 2003, &quot;Chicago 13&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with a B-Side, featuring Dacus&#x27;s &quot;Closer to You&quot; (an outtake from the &quot;Hot Streets&quot; sessions), and the 12-inch single mix of &quot;Street Player&quot; as bonus tracks.

The opening track, the disco-fueled extended jam &quot;Street Player&quot; was also released as a single and hit the R&amp;B singles chart on 12/1/1979 at 91 on the charts. The songs &quot;Street Player&quot; and &quot;Closer to You&quot; had previously been released by other artists: &quot;Street Player&quot; by Rufus, who recorded it before Chicago, and &quot;Closer&quot; by Stephen Stills, though with Donnie Dacus on lead vocals. &quot;Street Player&quot; did eventually reach hit status, being sampled for the 1995 hit &quot;The Bomb! (These Sounds Fall into My Mind)&quot; by The Bucketheads, the 2009 hit &quot;I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)&quot; by Pitbull and the 2013 remix by dance music producer &quot;Tradelove&quot;.

<text>Geoff Crammond is a computer game designer and programmer who specialises in motor racing games. A former defence industry systems engineer, he claims to have had little interest in motor racing before programming his first racing game (Revs) back in 1984, but he holds a physics degree, which may explain the realism of some of his programming. As a consequence of that project he became a big fan of Formula One motor racing. At the end of the 80s, this interest, plus the ever improving capabilities of home computers, inspired him to specialise in programming Formula One racing simulations.

== Games ==

One of his early releases was &quot;Aviator&quot;, a Spitfire simulator released by Acornsoft for the BBC Micro in March 1984. Having been motivated to make his own flight simulator from the hardware level upwards, Crammond identified the possibility of using one of the increasingly sophisticated home computers, if only &quot;to cannibalise it&quot;. Recognising the potential of the BBC Micro, he ordered one in 1981 and, upon receiving it six months later, then set about familiarising himself with the system, taking a detour to produce a Space Invaders clone, &quot;Super Invaders&quot;, which was accepted for publication and sold by Acornsoft. Discussion with Acornsoft about his plans for making a flight simulator led to the Aviator concept, and the program itself was written in a period of nine months.

Although displayed in only four colours and having few of the features of modern simulators for more powerful computers, Aviator was of unparalleled quality at the time of its release, with a realistic flight model that included g-forces that could tear the wings off in a dive. This would be accompanied by a continuous high pitched beep. The wings could be restored by removing the physical pressure on the airframe which was causing the flight envelope to be exceeded. Generally, this could be achieved by returning the joystick to a neutral centre position. The landscape was crudely rendered, and was basically a flat surface. Some scenic features were drawn as vector graphics, including low hills, fields, a lake, a suspension bridge over a river, and a small town which comprised a cluster of three buildings. Bonus points could be earned for flying under the bridge or along the main street of the town at a lower altitude than the buildings. Double points were earned for performing these stunts upside down. The game also had a shoot-&#x27;em-up mode in which alien vessels were seeded in the fields, feeding on the crops and growing until they could become airborne, at which point they headed for the town. The player could destroy the aliens on the ground as they fed, or (for reduced points) tackle them in the air (the aliens were agile but could not return fire). If an alien reached the town, the game was lost. A minor bug permitted the plane to be landed upside down without consequence, so long as the landing gear had been deployed.

Although better known for his Formula One simulation games on the PC and Amiga platforms, his first motor racing simulator was &quot;Revs&quot;, a Formula Three simulator that debuted on the BBC Micro platform in 1984. The BBC version of &quot;Revs&quot; featured just one track, the Silverstone circuit, but the realistic implementation of motor racing physics and artificial intelligence of the computer controlled components gave the game enormous depth and replayability. An enhanced edition of the BBC version was later released, in 1985, called &#x27;Revs 4 Tracks&#x27; which included Brands Hatch, Donington Park, Oulton Park and Snetterton race tracks.

A Commodore 64 version of the game, entitled &quot;Revs Plus&quot;, was released in 1986, which added the Brands Hatch track to the game. Later the Commodore 64 version added the Nürburgring to this list to continue the &quot;4 Tracks&quot; theme as Brands Hatch had already been included with the initial &quot;REVS Plus&quot; release. The Nürburgring was chosen as its new layout had recently been completed and computer based design data was available. This gives an idea of just how accurate REVS was as a simulation rather than &#x27;just&#x27; a game.

&quot;The Sentinel&quot; was published by Firebird on the BBC Micro in 1986. It was a 3D puzzle game, featuring ten thousand levels, in which the player had to manoeuvre his way through a landscape of cliffs, trees and boulders to topple the ominous Sentinel. The game was a critical and commercial success. Conversions for the ZX Spectrum, C64, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST and PC soon followed. A sequel, &quot;Sentinel Returns&quot;, was published by Psygnosis in 1998 on the PC and PlayStation platforms.

Crammond&#x27;s attention returned to motor racing simulators. &quot;Stunt Car Racer&quot; was a slightly offbeat driving simulation, rewarding the player for performing outrageous stunts on a number of elevated, roller-coaster-like courses. Although less serious in tone than his previous simulators, the game nevertheless used an impressive physics engine to offer a realistic driving experience. The game enjoyed cult status among many Amiga and Atari ST gamers. Ever since the early 1990s, Crammond&#x27;s primary focus has been on developing the award-winning Formula One Grand Prix series of games. The first game in the series, &quot;F1GP&quot; (aka &quot;World Circuit&quot; in the USA), was released by MicroProse on the Amiga in 1991 and is essentially the spiritual successor to &quot;Revs&quot;. Around this time &quot;Amiga Power&quot; magazine began referring to him as Sir Geoff, a running gag which has caught on with many others. The game was an instant success, earning a conversion to the Atari ST and PC platforms, but the inevitable sequel, &quot;Grand Prix 2&quot;, remained in development for three years before eventually being released on the PC in 1996.

&quot;Grand Prix 3&quot; was released on the PC in 2000 and was well received by fans and critics alike. Crammond&#x27;s series now had considerable competition from other developers, particularly Psygnosis/Sony, who were licensed by the FIA to produce the official Formula One gaming titles. &quot;Grand Prix 4&quot; was released on the PC in 2002 and is generally regarded as the most accurate game in the series. After &quot;Grand Prix 4&quot; there were rumours that Crammond&#x27;s next game would be Stunt Car Racer Pro, an updated version of his classic game. The rumours were later confirmed with an announcement that he was co-operating with Lost Toys studios. Lost Toys studios were closed in late 2003. At the beginning of 2005, the game was rumoured to be cancelled.

Crammond&#x27;s most recent game release is still GP4 (2002), which is still supported by fans with annual mods, in spite of MicroProse&#x27;s closure in 2001.

Following that, Crammond kept a low profile, but continues to engage in various programming projects.

<text>Auburn is a Western Sydney suburb in the state of New South Wales, Australia.
Auburn is located west of the Sydney central business district and is in the local government area of Cumberland City Council, having previously been the administrative centre of Auburn Council. 
The suburb was named after Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s poem &quot;The Deserted Village&quot;, which describes &#x27;Auburn&#x27; in England as the &quot;loveliest village of the plain&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===

The Auburn area was once used by Aboriginal people as a market place for the exchange of goods, a site for ritual battles and a &#x27;Law Place&#x27; for ceremonies. The area was located on the border between the Darug inland group and the Eora/Dharawal coastal group. The Wangal and Wategoro, sub-groups or clans, are the groups most often recognised as the original inhabitants of the Auburn/Homebush Bay region.

Bennelong, one of the most famous Natives of the time, was a member of Wangal, as was his wife, Barangaroo. Pemulwuy, who organised tribes to resist the white settlement of the Sydney region from 1790 to 1802 was also a member of the Wangal.

On 5 February 1788, soon after the landing of Captain Phillip at Sydney Cove, Captain John Hunter and Lieutenant William Bradley sailed up what is now known as the Parramatta River, as far as Homebush Bay. Captain Hunter was the first European to set foot within the Auburn Local Government Area. Ten days later, the Governor, along with a well-armed party in three boats, reached Homebush Bay. They ventured about inland. The following day a party of explorers traced the river in a westerly direction, coming to the place where the Duck River enters the Parramatta River. They explored the tributary as far as the depth of water permitted. Seeing what appeared to be ducks rising out of a swamp covered with reeds, they named the river Duck River. The ducks were actually Eastern Swamp Hens, but the name Duck River remained. The Eastern Swamp Hen featured prominently on the council&#x27;s Coat of Arms and was part of the former Auburn City Council logo.

===Settlement===
In February 1793, Auburn area was established as the first free-agricultural settlement thanks to Governor Phillip&#x27;s repeated applications to the British government for free settlers. Phillip was of the opinion that only free settlers with the assistance of convicts will be able to create an environment in which a country could support its inhabitants. Secretary Dundas endorsed Governor&#x27;s opinion and secured an agreement with several farmers, some of whom were members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), to settle in the colony. The first grants were given to Thomas Rose, Frederic Meredith, Thomas and Joseph Webb as well as Edward Powell. The deeds of the land described the farms&#x27; location as Liberty Plains and this is the name given to the neighbourhood of their farms by the first settlers, although the actual area bearing that name was a little further, lying at the upper part of Port Jackson. Dwellers of the Liberty Plains Parish were very proud of the fact that in the colony of felons they were the first people who came to Australia as free men and were given a privilege of choosing their own grants. This proud heritage is reflected in the motto on the Auburn coat of arms: &quot;Liberty, with steady zeal&quot;.

In the late 1870s a &quot;township&quot; was surveyed &quot;in the centre of the Liberty Plains… 11 miles from Sydney, on the Suburban Railway line&quot; and divided into &quot;fine township allotments all fronting grand wide streets&quot;. The subdivision was named &#x27;Auburn&#x27;, being a reference to Goldsmith&#x27;s poem &#x27;The Deserted Village&#x27;. The poem begins: &quot;Sweet Auburn! Loveliest village of the plain&quot;. Advertisements for the sale of allotments in May 1878 quoted the poem and added: &quot;So wrote the poet in years gone by in describing the &#x27;Auburn&#x27; of Old England, and fitly does it describe the new Auburn of the Sunny South&quot;.

One of the early settlers in the area was Fred Chisholm, who had an estate west of the present site of Auburn railway station. In the 1880s, John Buchanan, a timber merchant, purchased land from Fred Chisholm and built his home, &#x27;Duncraggarn Hall&#x27;, a two-storey Italianate mansion with a central tower and elaborate wrought-iron balconies. In 1892, Buchanan sold his thirteen-acre estate to the Sisters of Charity, who turned the house into St Joseph&#x27;s Hospital for Consumptives. In 1903, extensions to the hospital were constructed and the house itself became a convent for the sisters. Further modifications and extensions took place over the years, with the eventual result that the old hospital site became St Joseph&#x27;s Village—a retirement village—with a modern hospital next door. &#x27;Duncraggarn Hall&#x27; is heritage-listed.

===Auburn council===
The formal Auburn Local Government Area was formed in 1948, when Auburn and Lidcombe Councils merged into Auburn Municipal Council. In 2006 it became the City of Auburn which in 2016 was split between other local government areas.

===20th to 21st century and immigration===
In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Auburn became a popular point of settlement for successive waves of immigrants. In the post-World War II era, immigrants from Ukraine, Russia, Italy and Greece settled in Auburn, who were succeeded in the 1960s by immigrants from Turkey and Vietnam. More recently, in the early of 21st century, a large number of immigrants have settled in Auburn from China, South Korea, Nepal, Iran and Afghanistan. The history of immigrant settlement in Auburn has resulted in a suburb which is noted for its multicultural environment.

== Demographics ==
According to the , there were 39,333 residents in Auburn. The most common reported ancestries were Chinese 21.8%, Nepalese 12.7%, Turkish 8.1%, Lebanese 6.2% and Indian 6.1%. 28.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were China 14.4%, Nepal 12.7%, India 5.4%, Turkey 4.3% and Pakistan 3.7%. 12.2% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 14.1%, Nepali 12.6%, Arabic 10.5%, Turkish 7.5% and Urdu 6.8%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were Islam 38.5%, No Religion 17.3%, Hinduism 13.6%, Not stated 9.1% and Catholic 8.2%.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
Auburn railway station is on the Western and Leppington &amp; Inner West lines of the Sydney Trains network, where there are frequent services.

The Auburn Maintenance Centre, a large maintenance and storage facility which services Sydney Trains rolling stock, is located to the northwest of the town centre, close to Clyde station.

=== Bus ===
Auburn also has a number of bus services, which service Auburn and the surrounding areas.

Busways operate two routes to and from Auburn station:
*540: to Silverwater Correctional Complex
*544: to Macquarie Centre

Transit Systems operates four routes via Auburn station:
*908: Merrylands to Bankstown

== Heritage listings ==
Auburn has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Great Southern and Western railway: Auburn Railway Signal Box
* 93 Parramatta Road: Electricity Substation No. 167

==Commercial area==
Auburn has a mixture of residential, commercial and industrial areas. A commercial area is located close to Auburn railway station. There are many multicultural restaurants and cafes.

South of the railway station, the commercial area stretches for approximately and features many shops, restaurants and supermarkets, including a number of shops and restaurants specialising in Middle Eastern, Turkish and East Asian products and cuisine. This reflects Auburn&#x27;s history as a popular place of settlement for successive waves of immigrants in Sydney.

Some distance north of the town centre clustered around the railway station, commercial and industrial developments are also located along the length of Parramatta Road and surrounding streets.

It is home to the LFL team Auburn Wildcats who play in the Australian Eastern Conference as it is one of 6 teams in Sydney who represent this league. There are 40 teams in total of the LFL Australia and 12 are located in NSW.

<doc id="1113272" wikidata="Q332278" url="?curid=1113272" title="Absenteeism">
<text>Absenteeism is a habitual pattern of absence from a duty or obligation without good reason. Generally, absenteeism refers to unplanned absences. Absenteeism has been viewed as an indicator of poor individual performance, as well as a breach of an implicit contract between employee and employer. It is seen as a management problem, and framed in economic or quasi-economic terms. More recent scholarship seeks to understand absenteeism as an indicator of psychological, medical, or social adjustment to work.

== Workplace ==
High absenteeism in the workplace may be indicative of poor morale, but absences can also be caused by workplace hazards or sick building syndrome. Measurements such as the Bradford factor, a measurement tool to analyze absenteeism which believes short, unplanned absences affect the work group more than long term absences, do not distinguish between absence for genuine illness reasons and absence for non-illness related reasons. In 2013, the UK CIPD estimated that the average worker had 7.6 absent days per year and which cost employers £595 per employee annually. Measurement methods are not exact and all encompassing, resulting in skewed results depending on variables being observed. As a result, employees can feel obliged to come to work while ill, and transmit communicable diseases to their co-workers. This leads to even greater absenteeism and reduced productivity among other workers.

Work forces often excuse absenteeism caused by medical reasons if the employee provides supporting documentation from their medical practitioner. In Poland, if employees themselves, or anyone under their care including children and elders, falls ill, sick leave can be applied.

The psychological model that discusses this is the &quot;withdrawal model&quot;, which assumes that absenteeism represents individual withdrawal from dissatisfying working conditions. This finds empirical support in a negative association between absence and job satisfaction, in particular, the satisfaction with the work itself. Factors attributed to absence from work can include stress, family related concerns, work culture, the employees&#x27; ability to do the job, and supervisor–subordinate relationship.

Medical-based understanding of absenteeism finds support in research that links absenteeism for medical reasons with mental and behavioral disorders, diseases of the digestive system, neoplasms, and diseases of the genitourinary system. This excludes pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium. The cost of this, in euros, is 7.43 billion per year for men and 9.66 billion for women (6.7 billion euro after taking out pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium.) Research shows that over one trillion dollars are lost annually due to productivity shortages as a result of medical-related absenteeism. The line between psychological and medical causation is blurry, given that there are positive links between both work stress and depression, and absenteeism. Depressive tendencies may lie behind some of the absence ascribed to poor physical health, as with adoption of a &quot;culturally approved sick role&quot;. This places the adjective &quot;sickness&quot; before the word &quot;absence&quot;, and carries a burden of more proof than is usually offered.

Evidence indicates that absence is generally viewed as &quot;mildly deviant workplace behavior.&quot; For example, people tend to hold negative stereotypes of absentees, under report their own absenteeism, and believe their own attendance record is better than that of their peers. Negative attributions about absence then bring about three outcomes: the behavior is open to social control, sensitive to social context, and is a potential source of workplace conflict.

One tactic companies use to combat unplanned absences is the notion of paying back unused sick time. Moreover, high levels of work social capital can reduce absenteeism. While a distinction can be made between types of work social capital (bounding, bridging, direct-leader-linking, and top-level-linking), relationships with the immediate leader and the top management (direct-leader-linking and top-level-linking WSC) are most important to reduce employees’ absenteeism.

Pandemic absenteeism 

Absence due to illness and disability has ballooned since the pandemic. Healthier workplaces have lower absence rates. Paid leave reduces absence.

=== Management ===
Absenteeism is a habitual pattern correlated with emotional labor and personal reasoning, but there are resolutions to finding ways to alleviate the cause. Kelley, et al. (2016) says stress accounts for twelve percent of absenteeism in the workplace a year, which is a matter in which the company needs to stay in communication with the employee and work towards a solution. A great example of finding progress in absence management is forming an employee assistantship program (EAP), which is &quot;a strategy to help workers deal with issues outside of work that employees bring to the workplace&quot; (Quinley, 2003). This not only involves stress, but other mental health factors that employees deem worthy of attention. 

==== Planned vs unplanned ====
Planned absences from work include scheduled time off, retirement, and sabbaticals. These absences cause little to no disruption to work spaces because of the time given to work around the absence.

Unplanned absence from work is defined as leave that is not planned or predictable. It includes sick time off, injured time off, special circumstances, and absence without permission. Unplanned absences indicate an important factor of the health of the workplace, including employee satisfaction and commitment. The frequency of absences and total days missed are closely linked to job satisfaction levels. 

=== Sources ===
==== Bullying ====

Nearly every workplace that has a bully in charge will have elevated staff turnover and absenteeism.

==== Narcissism and psychopathy ====

According to Thomas, there tends to be a higher level of stress with people who work or interact with a narcissist, which in turn increases absenteeism and staff turnover. Boddy finds the same dynamic where there is a corporate psychopath in the organization.

== In school ==

While occasional school absenteeism may not be problematic, excessive absenteeism has shown to have a negative impact. Students with poor attendance records are found to be at a disadvantage both academically and socially. Compared to their peers, these students are more at risk of academic under-performance and early school leaving. They are also at risk of having more restricted opportunities in terms of further education and employment, and are likely to experience social and emotional problems in adulthood. Missing school can be a habit-forming behavior and can be challenging to deal with despite growing awareness of the causes of absenteeism.

Research evidence suggests that early interventions are six times more likely to be successful than those after students&#x27; non-attendance has reached the persistent stage. Equally, there is normally one initial reason, referred to as &quot;the trigger point&quot;, for the students&#x27; non-attendance. By the time students&#x27; absences have reached the persistent stage, there are at least several more reasons used to justify the action.

There are positive and negative reinforcements regarding student absenteeism. A positive reinforcement meaning that the student will receive either more attention from their parent or guardian, or receive tangible benefits from not going to school. A negative reinforcement meaning that the student is avoiding school. Dube and Orpinas conducted a study by surveying 99 upper-elementary and middle schools, targeting students with attendance problems. Three major profiles were identified from these students. Dube and Orpinas found that 17.2 percent missed school to avoid fear, anxiety problems, or escape from social or evaluative situations; 60.6 percent missed school to gain parental attention or tangible benefits; and 22.2 percent had no profile. All three groups significantly differed in mean scores for behavioral difficulties. Children who fit within multiple profiles had the highest level of behavioral problems, and children in the no-profile group had the lowest. Children with multiple profiles had higher mean scores on frequency of victimization and total number of traumatic or stressful events than did those in the other groups.

Although there are many theories to treating absenteeism, there is no universal treatment. There is however, a step by step process identified by Evie Bald, to manage absenteeism. This process includes identifying chronic absenteeism, identifying the reasoning behind the absences, work with families to address issues, and offer positive reinforcements if necessary.

<text>Cleobury Mortimer (, ) is a market town and civil parish in south-east Shropshire, England, which had a population of 3,036 at the 2011 census. It was granted a market charter by King Henry III in 1226.

==History==

The name is believed to derive from the contraction of the Old English meaning a steep place and &quot;bury&quot; meaning fortified settlement. Mortimer comes from Ranulph de Mortimer of Normandy to whom the land was granted after the Norman conquest. He founded the Mortimer dynasty of marcher lords who held power in the Welsh Marches throughout the Middle Ages and were closely involved with power struggles with successive English monarchs and other powerful Lords. Cleobury has a significant entry in the Domesday Book, and the vicinity was the location of at least two castles. Cleobury Castle, which was situated near St Mary&#x27;s Church, was destroyed in 1155 and only earthworks remain today. Toot Castle was situated on the other side of the River Rea from the town.

The central section of the town was laid out in burgage plots, the lines of which are still evident. With the decline of the marcher lords, and peace along the Welsh border, Cleobury&#x27;s importance declined during the Middle Ages, leaving it as an undistinguished market town, albeit with a dependent hinterland. In the 16th century, exploitation of local iron ores became important, and when Elizabeth I granted the town to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, his familiarity with modern ironworking technology led to the establishment of an important iron industry, with at least two furnaces (in which iron ore was converted to pig iron) and two water-powered forges (in which pig iron was converted to wrought iron). For a while, Cleobury&#x27;s iron industry was an important part of the general industrialisation in Shropshire (sometimes claimed as the seat of the Industrial Revolution), and iron from Cleobury&#x27;s forges was valued as a high-quality material. However, poor transport connections led to the decline of Cleobury&#x27;s iron industry in the early 19th century, and soon the town reverted to being an agricultural hub, although a large water-powered paper mill survived on the River Rea until a catastrophic fire towards the end of the century. By 1900, the town was an important civic centre, with a railway station, union workhouse, magistrates&#x27; court, police station, agricultural college, infants&#x27; school and primary school. Since the start of the twentieth century, Cleobury lost many of these facilities, although its population has grown. It thus exemplifies a common pattern for rural settlements, where centralisation and the rise of road transport have seen a decline in the local provision of services, despite a rising population.

Two literary figures have strong connections with Cleobury: William Langland and Simon Evans. Langland, a contemporary of Geoffrey Chaucer, is believed to have been born in the vicinity in the 14th century, and is commemorated in the very fine and intricate (Victorian) East Window of St Mary&#x27;s Church, as well as in a local road name. Simon Evans is a 20th-century writer, who fought throughout the First World War, and suffered from being gassed. He had been a postman on Merseyside before the war, and after the war sought a rural postal round, to soothe both nerves and body. Cleobury suited him well; here he blossomed, took a correspondence course in English, and became a successful writer and radio broadcaster in the 1930s. Heath Cranton published five of his books, and he married &#x27;Auntie Doris&#x27; (Aldridge), a radio performer, but his new life was cut short in 1940, when the effects of the gassing finally caught up with him. His legacy is visible in the naming of a local street, a plaque on the old Post Office, and a dedicated local walk—&#x27;The Simon Evans Way&#x27;—which the CM Footpath Association has created in recent years.

==Geography==

The River Rea runs to the east of the town, whilst through the town itself is the Pudding (or Burrell) Brook, which flows from west to east before meeting the Rea. The land gradually rises from 110 metres above sea level near to the river, to 150 metres in the west of the town. The Clee Hills, the highest hills in Shropshire, are nearby and the Wyre Forest lies between the town and Bewdley. The border with Worcestershire is a mile to the south.

The A4117 Kidderminster to Ludlow road runs through the centre of the town and crosses the River Rea at New Bridge. The B4363 runs between Cleobury Mortimer (its junction with the A4117 being immediately east of New Bridge) and Bridgnorth. The county town, Shrewsbury, is some distant by road, making Cleobury the most distant town from Shrewsbury in the county.

Cleobury was formerly served by two now-defunct railways: the Tenbury &amp; Bewdley Railway and the Cleobury Mortimer and Ditton Priors Light Railway. The opening of the latter in 1908 elevated Cleobury Mortimer station (which was located some distance from the town, in the Wyre Forest) to the status of a &#x27;Junction&#x27;. A separate station called Cleobury Town existed nearer the town, but only on the Ditton Priors line. Today the nearest railway stations are on the heritage Severn Valley Railway, with the nearest mainline stations at Ludlow and Kidderminster. There is a regular bus service (Diamond Bus 292) that runs between Ludlow and Kidderminster via Cleobury. This was at one time part of a much longer service which operated between Hereford and Birmingham but was divided into separate routes several years ago.

The civil parish of Cleobury Mortimer has no notable settlements, other than the town itself, though it covers a large rural area including part of the Wyre Forest. In 2017, the parish council officially gave notice to Shropshire Council that it would thereafter be styled Cleobury Mortimer Town Council, although it does not elect a mayor.

To the north lie the settlements of Neenton and Neen Savage, and to the south-west lies the small village of Neen Sollars. &quot;Neen&quot; was the name of the River Rea in the past. Further to the north lies Cleobury North, a small village with the same etymological root.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. This ward stretches mainly to the north and at the 2011 census had a population of 7,226.

==Landmarks and amenities==

There are a number of landmarks in the town, the most famous of which is the 12th-century St Mary&#x27;s Church in the town centre, renowned for its crooked spire, the combined result of the warping of its oak timbers, and damp-induced rot where the timber spire sits on the masonry tower. Across the road from the churchyard is The Wells, fed from a local spring and for centuries serving as a public water supply. In 2010, for reasons as yet unexplained, the inflow to The Wells ceased for a while, and has only been intermittent since then. To the west of the church is the recently refurbished Market Hall, which now houses a number of facilities including the Tourist Information Centre.

There are six public houses in the town of Cleobury, with a further one (the Blount Arms) on the A4117 road in the direction of Kidderminster. The town also has a secondary school, Lacon Childe, a primary school, a library, a post office and a fire station; until 2014 it also had a police station.

The town featured in a series of reports by Declan Curry in &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; in June 2006. As part of the series, Curry interviewed a number of local residents and business owners to learn more about the rural economy.

==Brewery==

Hobsons brewery was established in 1993 and moved to its present site at New House Farm, on Tenbury Road approximately 500 metres south-west of the town centre, in 1995. The brewery brews and delivers its beer to public houses within a 50-mile radius, as well as bottle-conditioned ale to shops throughout the UK. Its regular mild, best bitter and strong bitter (Old Henry) ales have won taste awards, and the mild was chosen to be a guest beer in the House of Commons bar in 2008. Hobsons produce a bottle-only mild ale, named in honour of Simon Evans, called Postman&#x27;s Knock. In 2009, the brewery installed a small wind turbine, which generates around a third of the electricity required by the brewery, and the company use other environmentally sustainable technologies. The King&#x27;s Arms in the town became the brewery tap in 2007 and was the first pub to receive a delivery of Hobsons beer in 1993. Hobsons also produce two special beers for the local heritage railway, the Severn Valley Railway.

==Media==

<text>Bulletproof is a 1996 American buddy cop action comedy film directed by Ernest Dickerson and starring Damon Wayans, Adam Sandler, James Farentino and James Caan.

Released theatrically in the United States by Universal Pictures on September 6, 1996, &quot;Bulletproof&quot; was panned by critics and grossed $22.6 million worldwide.

==Plot==

Archie Moses is a small-time thief in Los Angeles who smuggles drugs for drug lord Frank Colton, who launders his drug money through a car dealership. Moses is unaware that his best friend, Rock Keats, is actually LAPD undercover cop Jack Carter, who befriended him to infiltrate Colton&#x27;s gang.

Carter has Moses include him in Colton&#x27;s next drug shipment, secretly planning to arrest Colton and take in Moses, whom he has come to care about, unharmed. Carter&#x27;s undercover status is revealed before he can enact his plan, however, and a hurt Moses pulls a gun on him. During the raid on Colton&#x27;s warehouse, an out of control crane hits Moses in the back, causing him to accidentally shoot Carter in the head. He then flees the state, and is subsequently found and arrested.

Carter miraculously survives and makes a full recovery with the aid of his physical therapist, Dr. Traci Flynn, with whom he falls in love. Moses is brought into custody, and he agrees to testify against Colton, but the trial is set to take place at the other side of the country. Carter&#x27;s superior officer, Capt. Jensen, orders him to personally transfer Moses to the courtroom.

Carter harbors resentment against Moses, and tensions escalate once the simple transfer goes awry. Colton learns through bribed federal agents and LAPD officers of Moses&#x27; attempt to testify against him. As they flee from Colton&#x27;s men, Carter and Moses slowly mend their friendship, and are successful in returning to Carter&#x27;s precinct. However, Colton apparently holds Flynn hostage, and blackmails Carter into turning Moses over to save Flynn.

Carter and Moses pretend to comply with Colton, and shoot their way through Colton&#x27;s guards. It is later revealed that Flynn is on Colton&#x27;s payroll, and is responsible for leaking Carter&#x27;s and Moses&#x27; whereabouts to him. Moses takes a bullet in the shoulder to save Carter&#x27;s life, giving him time enough to arrest Flynn, then shoots Colton dead. Moses gives the incriminating documents on Colton to Carter, who allows him to escape. He heads to Mexico to become a bullfighter, with Carter and Moses&#x27; mother later accompanying him.

==Cast==
==Production==
Reflecting on the film years later, director Ernest Dickerson spoke to DVD Talk of his regretful experiences making the film:

==Soundtrack==
A soundtrack containing mostly hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on September 3, 1996, by MCA Records. It reached No. 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #23 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

In addition, Varese Sarabande released an album of Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s score.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Bulletproof&quot; grossed $6 million its opening weekend, placing it at No. 1 at the box office. By the end of its theatrical run, it pulled in $21.6 million in North America and $1 million internationally for a worldwide total of $22.6 million.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 8% based on 38 reviews and an average rating of 3.7/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;In addition to its ability to deflect gunfire, &quot;Bulletproof&quot; proves sadly impervious to humor, logic, or worthwhile viewing.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 30 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

<text>Clifton George Bailey III (born 13 April 1967), better known by his stage name Capleton, is a Jamaican reggae and dancehall musician. He is also referred to as King Shango, King David, The Fireman and The Prophet. His record label is called David House Productions. He is known for his Rastafari views expressed in his songs.

== Early life ==
Bailey was born in Islington in St. Mary in 1967. As a youth, he was given the surname of a popular St. Mary lawyer and friend of the family, Capleton, as a nickname by his relatives and friends.
Capleton rejects the name given to him at birth. He now prefers &quot;King Shango&quot;, given its roots in the Yoruba language.

As a teenager, he sneaked out of his home to catch local dancehall acts, eventually leaving St. Mary for Kingston at the age of 18 to work on his career as a dancehall deejay.

== Career ==

=== Early career ===

In 1989, he got his first big international exposure. Stewart Brown, owner of a Toronto-based sound called African Star, gave the untested artist his first break, flying him to Canada for a stage show alongside Ninjaman and Flourgon.

When Capleton first arrived on the scene in the late 1980s, slackness and gun talk were the dominant lyrics in the dancehalls. The pre-Rasta Capleton had a string of hit songs from &quot;Bumbo Red&quot; to &quot;Number One on the Look Good Chart&quot; and &quot;No Lotion Man&quot;.

He recorded the song that began to establish his significant place in dancehall, &quot;Alms House&quot; in 1992. The tune became a big hit in the dancehall, followed up immediately by &quot;Music is a Mission&quot; and the massive hit &quot;Tour&quot;. By 1993, he was voicing tunes which became increasingly conscious, such as &quot;Prophet&quot; and &quot;Cold Blooded Murderer&quot;.

Tunes such as &quot;Tour&quot; and &quot;Wings of the Morning&quot; earned him a deal with Russell Simmons&#x27; Def Jam Recordings, which culminated in the &quot;Prophecy&quot; and &quot;I-Testament&quot; albums of the mid-1990s.

=== Later career ===

In 1999, Capleton headlined Reggae Sumfest&#x27;s dancehall night, to much fanfare. The performance, which led to a subsequent headliner placement the following year, is credited with &quot;re-bussing&quot;, or creating a comeback for, his career.
The 1999–2000 period elicited a string of hits, many of which can be found on the album &quot;More Fire&quot;.

By 2004, some argued the quality of Capleton&#x27;s music had been downgraded by over-proliferation on numerous riddims, while Capleton himself argued his continued recording over both dancehall and roots reggae riddims created balance in his musical output. Nonetheless, he scored hit singles over one of the most popular riddims of 2004, &quot;That Day Will Come&quot; over the Hard Times riddim.

After a hiatus from the label, Capleton returned to VP Records in 2010 with the release of &quot;I-Ternal Fire&quot;.

After headlining a U.S. tour which included Romain Virgo, Munga Honorable, and Kulcha Knox in the fall of 2010, Capleton embarked upon a tour of the African continent for late 2010 and early 2011. Stops included Gambia, Senegal, South Africa and multiple dates in Zimbabwe. In December 2012 the music Unite Cape Town International Reggae Festival saw Capleton, reggae and dancehall artists like Black Dillinger, Blak Kalamawi .

Capleton&#x27;s annual &#x27;A St Mary Mi Come From&#x27; live show has raised funds for several charities since it was first staged in 2000, including local schools and hospitals.

== Religious views ==
Capleton makes reference to Bobo Ashanti, one of the various mansions of the Rastafari movement. Yet he frequently mentions there is no separation between the mansions of Rastafari as he sees it. He stated in an interview on TraceTV that he is a vegan, not consuming meat or dairy in any form, but he also rejects anything made from soya. He also touches on the subject of his lyrics regarding fire, saying they are metaphoric references of purification, not violence or murder.

== Criticisms ==
Capleton has faced criticism for anti-gay lyrics in some of his songs though homosexuality remains illegal in his native Jamaica. His manager has argued that some of the controversial lyrics have been mistranslated and do not actually refer to gays. Capleton himself has admitted that through his Rastafari faith he believes that a homosexual lifestyle is not right, but has insisted that terms such as &quot;burn&quot; and &quot;fire&quot; are not to be understood in the literal sense &quot;to go out and burn and kill people&quot;, but as a metaphor for &quot;purification&quot; and cleansing.

However, Capleton has continued to sing songs that some see as anti-gay, causing the cancellation of a concert in Switzerland in 2008 and a United States tour in 2010.

<doc id="1113288" wikidata="Q650680" url="?curid=1113288" title="Haman">
<text>Haman ( ; also known as Haman the [[Agagite]]) is the main antagonist in the Book of Esther, who according to the Hebrew Bible was an official in the court of the Persian empire under King Ahasuerus, commonly identified as Xerxes I (died 465 BCE) but traditionally equated with Artaxerxes I or Artaxerxes II. His epithet, &quot;Agagite&quot;, indicates that Haman was a descendant of Agag, the king of the Amalekites. Some commentators interpret this descent to be symbolic, due to his similar personality.

In the narrative of the Book of Esther, Haman was a proud and ambitious man who demanded that everyone bow down to him as a sign of respect. However, a Jewish man named Mordecai refused to bow down to him, which enraged Haman. Seeking revenge, Haman convinced the king to issue a decree that all Jews in the Persian empire be exterminated. Haman&#x27;s plot was foiled by Queen Esther, who was also Jewish and had concealed her identity from the King. Esther revealed Haman&#x27;s plan to Ahasuerus and pleaded with him to spare her people. The King was outraged at Haman&#x27;s treachery and ordered that he be executed instead.

==Etymology and meaning of the name==
The name has been equated with the Persian name &quot;Omanes&quot; (, ) recorded by Greek historians. Several etymologies have been proposed for it: it has been associated with the Persian word , meaning &quot;illustrious&quot; (naming dictionaries typically list it as meaning &quot;magnificent&quot;); with the sacred drink Haoma; or with the Persian name Vohuman, meaning &quot;good thoughts&quot;. The 19th-century Bible critic Jensen associated it with the Elamite god Humban, a view dismissed by later scholars. Ahriman, a Zoroastrian spirit of destruction, has also been proposed as an etymon. Hoschander suggests that Haman is a priestly title and not a proper name.

== Haman in the Hebrew Bible ==
As described in the Book of Esther, Haman was the son of Hammedatha the Agagite. After Haman was appointed the principal minister of the king Ahasuerus, all of the king&#x27;s servants were required to bow down to Haman, but Mordecai refused to. Angered by this, and knowing of Mordecai&#x27;s Jewish nationality, Haman convinced Ahasuerus to allow him to have all of the Jews in the Persian empire killed.

The plot was foiled by Queen Esther, the king&#x27;s recent wife, who was herself a Jew. Esther invited Haman and the king to two banquets. In the second banquet, she informed the king that Haman was plotting to kill her (and the other Jews). This enraged the king, who was further angered when (after leaving the room briefly and returning) he discovered Haman had fallen on Esther&#x27;s couch, intending to beg mercy from Esther, but which the king interpreted as a sexual advance.

On the king&#x27;s orders, Haman was hanged from the 50-cubit-high gallows that had originally been built by Haman himself, on the advice of his wife Zeresh, in order to hang Mordecai. The bodies of Haman&#x27;s 10 sons were also hanged, after they died in battle against the Jews. The Jews also killed about 75,000 of their enemies in self-defense.

The apparent purpose of these unusually high gallows can be understood from the geography of Shushan: Haman&#x27;s house (where the pole was located) was likely in the city of Susa (a flat area), while the royal citadel and palace were located on a mound about 15 meters higher than the city. Such a tall pole would have allowed Haman to observe Mordecai&#x27;s corpse while dining in the royal palace, had his plans worked as intended.

== Haman in other sources ==
=== Midrash ===

According to Ḥanan b. Rava, his mother was ʾĂmatlaʾy, a descendant of ʿÔrebtî (also ʿÔrǝbtāʾ &quot;she-raven&quot;), apparently patriarch of a major Nehardean house.

TgEsth1 and TgEsth3 call him &quot;Haman the son of Hamedatha, descended from Agag the son of Amaleq.&quot; The Targum Sheni gives Haman&#x27;s lineage as follows: &quot;Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, son of Khada, son of Kuza, son of Alipilot, son of Dios, son of Diosos, son of Peros, son of Ma&#x27;dan, son of Bala&#x27;qan, son of Antimiros, son of Hadrus, son of Shegar, son of Negar, son of Parmashta, son of Vaizatha, son of Agag, son of Sumqar, son of Amalek, son of a concubine of Eliphaz the son of Esau&quot;. There are apparently several generations omitted between Agag, who was executed by Samuel the prophet in the time of King Saul, and Amalek, who lived several hundred years earlier. According to the Midrash Abba Gorion, Haman was also called Memucan, because he was &quot;destined for punishment&quot;.

In Rabbinic tradition, Haman is considered to be an archetype of evil and persecutor of the Jews. Having attempted to exterminate the Jews of Persia, and rendering himself thereby their worst enemy, Haman naturally became the center of many Talmudic legends. Being at one time extremely poor, he sold himself as a slave to Mordecai. He was a barber at Kefar Karzum for the space of twenty-two years. Haman had an idolatrous image embroidered on his garments, so that those who bowed to him at command of the king bowed also to the image.

Haman was also an astrologer, and when he was about to fix the time for the genocide of the Jews he first cast lots to ascertain which was the most auspicious day of the week for that purpose. Each day, however, proved to be under some influence favorable to the Jews. He then sought to fix the month, but found that the same was true of each month; thus, Nisan was favorable to the Jews because of the Passover sacrifice; Iyyar, because of the small Passover. But when he arrived at Adar he found that its zodiacal sign was Pisces, and he said, &quot;Now I shall be able to swallow them as fish which swallow one another&quot; (Esther Rabbah 7; Targum Sheni 3).

Haman had 365 counselors, but the advice of none was so good as that of his wife, Zeresh. She induced Haman to build a gallows for Mordecai, assuring him that this was the only way in which he would be able to prevail over his enemy, for hitherto the just had always been rescued from every other kind of death. As God foresaw that Haman himself would be hanged on the gallows, he asked which tree would volunteer to serve as the instrument of death. Each tree, declaring that it was used for some holy purpose, objected to being soiled by the unclean body of Haman. Only the thorn-tree could find no excuse, and therefore offered itself for a gallows (Esther Rabbah 9; Midrash Abba Gorion 7 (ed. Buber, Wilna, 1886); in Targum Sheni this is narrated somewhat differently).

According to the Targum Sheni, he killed the prophet Daniel, who managed to live to Ahasuerus&#x27;s reign (Targum Sheini on Esther, 4, 11).

=== Quran ===

In the Qur&#x27;an (Islam&#x27;s primary scripture), Haman () is a person mentioned and associated with pharaoh of the Exodus. Islam started up in 610 CE. McAuliffe&#x27;s Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān among other sources relates &quot;Haman&quot; to be the Arabized form of &quot;Ha-Amana&quot; in Egyptian. Muhammad Asad contended that Haman is Ha-Amen as shortcut of the first few letters of title of High Priest of Amun in his book &quot;The Message of The Qur&#x27;an&quot;.
However, some scholars disagree with the theory of the Quranic Haman being an Egyptian title, instead of a name and the biblical figure himself.

Haman appears six times throughout the Qur&#x27;an four times with Pharaoh and twice by himself, where God sent Moses to invite Pharaoh, Haman, and their people to monotheism, and to seek protection of the Israelites whom Haman and Pharaoh were tormenting. Referring to Moses as a sorcerer and a liar, the Pharaoh rejected Moses&#x27; call to worship the God of Moses and refused to free the Israelite children. The Pharaoh commissioned Haman to build a tall tower using burnt bricks so that the Pharaoh could ascend and see the God of Moses. The Pharaoh, Haman, and their army in chariots pursuing Israel&#x27;s fleeing children drowned in the Red Sea as the parted water closed on them. The Pharaoh&#x27;s submission to God at the moment of death and total destruction was rejected, but his corpse was saved as a lesson for posterity and he was mummified.
=== Josephus ===
Josephus mentions Haman in his &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;. Josephus&#x27;s account of the story draws from the Septuagint translation of the Book of Esther and from other Greek and Jewish sources, some no longer extant.

===Septuagint===

The Greek version of the Book of Esther, known as the Septuagint, portrays Haman in a distinct manner:

1. Haman is referred to as a &quot;Macedonian&quot; and described as &quot;an alien&quot; to Persia. This characterization presents him as an outsider and not a true Persian.

2. Haman is accused of plotting to transfer the sovereignty of Persia to the Macedonians, while the Jews are called &quot;loyal Persians&quot; by the king. This portrays Haman as disloyal and conspiring against Persia.

3. In various passages, Haman is referred to as an &quot;Agagite&quot; (Amalekite), &quot;Gogite&quot; (from the cursed city of Gog), &quot;Ebugaios&quot; (an unexplained term), and &quot;Bugaean&quot;. These labels serve to further mark Haman as a foreigner and enemy.

4. The text suggests that Haman represents the Biblical Amalekites, the epitome of evil that God commands to be destroyed. Haman thus symbolizes the evil that the Jews must struggle against in every generation until the final eschatological triumph of God&#x27;s kingdom.

=== Vulgate ===

As in the Septuagint, Haman&#x27;s execution is ambiguous, suggestive of both hanging and crucifixion. The fifty-cubit object, described as &quot;xylon&quot; in the Septuagint (), is similarly ambiguously referred to as &quot;wood&quot; (). The Vulgate translation of Esther 7:10 furthermore refers to a , used elsewhere to describe the cross-piece in crucifixion, when describing the fate of Haman: . In the corner of the Sistine Chapel ceiling is a depiction in fresco of the execution of Haman by Michelangelo; Haman is shown crucified in a manner similar to typical Catholic depictions of the crucifixion of Jesus, though the legs are parted and the apparatus resembles a natural tree shorter than fifty cubits high.

===English translations===
Translations of the &quot;Book of Esther&quot;&#x27;s description of Haman&#x27;s execution have variously treated the subject. Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible referred both to a &quot;tre&quot; (tree) and a &quot;iebat&quot; (gibbet), while Coverdale&#x27;s preferred &quot;galowe&quot; (gallows). The Geneva Bible used &quot;tree&quot; but the King James Version established &quot;gallows&quot; and &quot;hang&quot; as the most common rendering; the Douay–Rheims Bible later used &quot;gibbet&quot;. Young&#x27;s Literal Translation used &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;hang&quot;. The New International Version, Common English Bible, and New Living Translation all use &quot;impale&quot; for and &quot;pole&quot; for .

=== As a god ===
Jacob Hoschander has argued that the name of Haman and that of his father Hamedatha are mentioned by Strabo as &quot;Omanus&quot; and &quot;Anadatus&quot;, worshipped with Anahita in the city of Zela. Hoschander suggests that Haman may, if the connection is correct, be a priestly title and not a proper name. Strabo&#x27;s names are unattested in Persian texts as gods; however the Talmud and Josephus interpret the description of courtiers bowing to Haman in Esther 3:2 as worship (other scholars assume &quot;Omanus&quot; refers to Vohu Mana).

== Purim traditions ==

The Jewish holiday of Purim commemorates the story of the Jews&#x27; deliverance and Haman&#x27;s defeat. On that day, the Book of Esther is publicly read and much noise and tumult is raised at every mention of Haman&#x27;s name. Various noisemakers (&quot;graggers&quot;) are used to express disdain for Haman by &quot;blotting out&quot; his name during the recitation of Megillah. Pastry known as (Yiddish for &#x27;Haman&#x27;s pockets&#x27;; known in Hebrew as , , &#x27;Haman&#x27;s ears&#x27;) is traditionally eaten on this day.

Since the 1890s, several academics have &quot;agreed in seeing [The Book of] Esther as a historicized myth or ritual&quot; and generally concluded that Purim has its origin in a Babylonian or Persian myth or festival (though which one is a subject of discussion). However, more recent scholarship places Purim&#x27;s origins in the region of Palestine instead.

==In literature and popular culture==
=== Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ===
Haman at the moment of his execution appears at the beginning of Canto 17 of &quot;Purgatorio&quot; in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divina Commedia&quot;. The image occurs in the form of a spontaneous vision given to the character of Dante-as-pilgrim, the purpose of which is to envision Haman&#x27;s accusers, Ahaseurus, Esther and Mordecai, as emblems of righteous anger. In this divinely inspired hallucination, the fictional Dante sees Haman as &quot;un crucifisso&quot;, a man who undergoes crucifixion. 

=== Novels ===
Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s novel, &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1936) references Haman in the scene in which Rhett Butler, in jail, faces the prospect of hanging.

The Agatha Christie novel, &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; references Haman in a scene where Poirot, investigating a murder, says he will &quot;hang him as high as Haman&quot;.

In the Lord Peter Wimsey novel &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot;, Lord Peter, revealing that the victim, Geoffrey Deacon, was inadvertently killed by the ringing of bells, declares that his killers are already hanging &quot;far higher than Haman&quot;.

=== Visual media ===
Haman is characterised as evil vizier to a sultan in the &quot;Aliyah-Din&quot; segment of the 1994 made-for-television film &quot;Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights&quot;. 

He is featured as the primary antagonist in the 1999 &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Jewbilee&quot;, in which he is portrayed as attempting to re-enter the mortal world in order to rule once more over the Jews. 

The character was depicted in the American feature film &quot;One Night with the King&quot; (2006), played by James Callis. 

American children&#x27;s television animations in which the biblical story of Haman is told include the &quot;Queen Esther&quot; episode of the series &quot;The Greatest Adventure: Stories from the Bible&quot; (1985-1992), where he is voiced by Werner Klemperer, and the computer-generated series &quot;VeggieTales&quot; (2000), in which he is portrayed by &quot;Mr. Lunt&quot; during the episode &quot;Esther, the Girl who Became Queen&quot;.

<text>Isabel Nancy Hilton OBE (born 25 November 1947) is a Scottish journalist and broadcaster, based in London.

==Early life==

Hilton attended school in Alford, Aberdeenshire, Bradford Girls&#x27; Grammar School (Yorkshire) and Walnut Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio). She graduated from Edinburgh University, where she studied Chinese to post-graduate level, subsequently studying at Beijing Languages Institute and Fudan University, Shanghai. In 1976, she briefly served as secretary of the Scotland-China Association, based at her University, and was placed on MI5&#x27;s &quot;black&quot; list, which prevented her from accepting a job offer with the BBC in 1976.

==Career==

Over a long career in national and international print, online and broadcast media, Isabel Hilton has covered global politics, conflict, development, human rights, climate change and environmental degradation. In recent years her work has focussed on the impacts of a rising China with particular emphasis on climate change and China&#x27;s global environmental footprint.

In addition to her writing career, she has made several radio and television documentaries and presented both BBC&#x27;s Radio 4 current affairs programme &quot;The World Tonight &quot;and Radio 3&#x27;s arts and cultural strand, &quot;Night Waves&quot;.

She left the &quot;Daily Express&quot; five months later to join the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; where she subsequently held posts as feature writer, news reporter, &quot;Insight&quot; reporter and Latin America editor. 
She covered the Falklands War from Buenos Aires in 1982 and continued to cover Latin America until the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; became embroiled in the dispute over its move to Wapping.

<doc id="1113291" wikidata="Q2914993" url="?curid=1113291" title="Haman (Islam)">
<text>Haman () is a person mentioned in the Qur&#x27;an where he appears as court official of the Firaun of Exodus, and associated with him in his court at the time of the Islamic prophet (Musa), Moses in Christianity and Judaism.

The name Haman, however, also appears in the biblical Book of Esther where Haman is a counselor of Ahasuerus, king of Persia and an enemy of the Jews. The relationship between the Biblical and Quranic Haman has been a topic of debate. There is no evidence of such stories in Egyptian history. Some Islamic scholars compared plot elements of the book of Esther when they elaborated on the Quranic narrative of the Exodus.

==Qur&#x27;anic Narrative==
The name Haman appears six times throughout the Qur&#x27;an, Quran 29:39,40:24, 28:8, 28:38. four times with Pharaoh and twice by himself, where God sends Moses to invite Pharaoh, Haman and their people to monotheism, and to seek protection of the Israelites Haman and Pharaoh were tormenting. 

Referring to Moses as a sorcerer and a liar the Pharaoh rejected Moses&#x27; call to worship the God of Moses and refused to set the children of Israel free. The Pharaoh commissioned Haman to build a tall tower using fire-cast bricks so that the Pharaoh could climb far up and see the God of Moses. The Pharaoh, Haman, and their army in chariots pursuing the fleeing children of Israel drowned in the Red Sea as the parted water closed up on them. The Pharaoh&#x27;s submission to God at the moment of death and total destruction was rejected but his dead body was saved as a lesson for posterity.

==High Priest of Amun==

Some have proposed that the name &quot;Haman&quot;, like &quot;Pharaoh&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an and Old Testament is not a proper name, but a title. The description of Haman in the Qur&#x27;an serving in both a priestly religious role and that of one who&#x27;s in charge of building projects answerable to the Pharaoh himself draws parallels with the High Priest of Amun. 

McAuliffe&#x27;s Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān among other sources relates &quot;Haman&quot; to be the Arabized form of &quot;Ha-Amana,&quot; a title which roughly translates to &quot;incarnate of (the God) Amun&quot; or &quot;King of Amun&quot; and was utilized by the high priest.

<text>Chicago XIV is the twelfth studio album by American rock band Chicago, released on July 21, 1980. Recorded at a time of waning interest in the band, &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; remains one of Chicago&#x27;s poorest-selling albums, failing to reach Gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was deemed a commercial flop. It is also notable for being their last studio album with Columbia Records, and the last one to feature percussionist Laudir de Oliveira.

==Background==
After the commercial and critical disappointment of &quot;Chicago 13&quot;, and the departure of guitarist Donnie Dacus, Chicago decided that a new strategy was in order. Chris Pinnick played guitar on the sessions and would later become an official member. The band also tried a new producer, this time Tom Dowd, who had worked with Aretha Franklin, Cream, and Eric Clapton. With Dowd taking the reins, and with Chicago abandoning the dance club sound that permeated their previous album, the band recorded a lean, more streamlined record which would, predictably, be called &quot;Chicago XIV&quot;. Possibly designed as a response to the under-produced, new wave efforts on the radio at the time, the album was the band&#x27;s least orchestrated effort to date.

==Artwork, packaging==
Designed by John Berg, art director of Columbia/CBS Records, the album cover front features an album-cover-size black thumbprint on a white background, with the Chicago logo embedded in the whorls. The album cover back also features an album-cover-size black fingerprint or thumbprint on white background, but without the embedded Chicago logo. The inside dust cover is white with black printing that lists album credits, and also has at the edge four life-size black fingerprints from a right hand on the credits side of the liner, and a corresponding life-size black thumbprint at the edge of the back of the liner. This small thumbprint also has the Chicago logo embedded in the whorls. Berg was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Album Package for this album. The cover was included in a 2012-2013 exhibit of Berg&#x27;s album covers at Guild Hall of East Hampton. The cover artwork is in the permanent collection of The Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

==Release and aftermath==
With four solo writing credits and one cowriting credit among the ten songs on the album, Peter Cetera took on a greater songwriting role in the band than in the past. His compositions included a mix of ballads, pop and rock songs. Robert Lamm turned in the rockers &quot;Manipulation&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Be Rich&quot; (a song from 1975); James Pankow delivered the uptempo – if downbeat – &quot;The American Dream&quot;; and Lamm and Danny Seraphine co-wrote &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot;. &quot;Birthday Boy&quot; marked the final collaboration between Seraphine and his songwriting partner Hawk Wolinski. Like &quot;Chicago 13&quot; before it, &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; failed to improve Chicago&#x27;s fortunes. To the record-buying public, Chicago&#x27;s image was out of touch in 1980, and once the new album was released, it became clear that any attempt to win new fans would be in vain.

Columbia Records was increasingly disappointed with the poor sales performance of the band. &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; went unnoticed upon release and bombed, reaching only number seventy-one on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, and disappeared quickly. Again, there were no singles hits, with &quot;Thunder and Lightning&quot; stalling below the top fifty and &quot;Song For You&quot; failing to chart. Chicago also saw a poor attendance in many venues during the supporting tour. Realizing that the relationship had soured considerably, Columbia Records terminated their contract with Chicago with a buyout of approximately $2 million. In 1982, Robert Lamm recalled, 

As a settlement to ending the arrangement early, Columbia released the band&#x27;s second greatest-hits album and jettisoned them from the label. The money from the settlement was used to record &quot;Chicago 16&quot; independently, while the band shopped for a new label (eventually they signed with Warner). Realizing that the Latin/Jazz percussion style evident in the latter half of the previous decade no longer fit with their &quot;more pop-oriented sound&quot;, while beginning work on &quot;Chicago 16,&quot; the album &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; signaled the end of percussionist Laudir de Oliveira&#x27;s tenure with the band after nine years. Peter Cetera, meanwhile, concentrated on his first self-titled solo album during the hiatus.

In 2003, &quot;Chicago XIV&quot; was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records, with three outtakes from the sessions, &quot;Doin&#x27; Business&quot; (which first appeared on the 1991 4-Disc anthology &quot;Group Portrait&quot;), &quot;Live It Up&quot;, and &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; as bonus tracks.

<doc id="1113295" wikidata="Q378985" url="?curid=1113295" title="West Morava">
<text>West Morava (, ) is a river in Central Serbia, a 184-km long headstream of the Great Morava, which it forms with the South Morava. It was known as Brongus in antiquity.

== Origin ==
The West Morava originates in the Tašti field, east of the town of Požega, from the Golijska Moravica and Đetinja headstreams. Đetinja receives from the left its main tributary, the Skrapež. Less than a kilometer after the confluence, it meets the Golijska Moravica flowing from the south, forming the West Morava. Given the proximity of the confluences of Đetinja, Skrapež and Golijska Moravica, some sources consider all three rivers to be direct headstreams of the West Morava River. Following the direction of the course, the Đetinja is a natural headstream of the West Morava. But since Golijska Moravica is 23 km longer, the latter is considered as the main headstream. Measured from the source of the Golijska Moravica, the West Morava is 282 km long; the length of the West Morava proper is 184 km.

== Course ==
Unlike the South and Great Morava&#x27;s meridian (south-to-north) flow, the West Morava runs in an opposed, latitudinal (west-to-east) direction, dividing the region of Šumadija of the central Serbia from the southern parts of the country.

Due to the West Morava&#x27;s direction, it flows between many mountains, regions and sub-regions:

* between the regions of Zlatibor (Srbija) to the north and Dragačevo to the south; here it receives the &quot;Bjelica&quot; from the south and the small town of Lučani, center of Dragačevo, is located in the vicinity, south of the river.
* between the Ovčar (north) and Kablar (south) mountains; the river here carved the Ovčar-Kablar Gorge; the West Morava is dammed in the gorge (which is called Serbian Mount Athos, due to many monasteries) and again right after it, so the artificial Ovčar-Kablar and Međuvršje lakes are formed.
* between the Takovo region (north) and Jelica mountain and Goračići region (south); here is located the town of Čačak, the river is dammed again (Lake Parmenac) and receives many tributaries (mostly from the left: the &quot;Čemernica&quot;, &quot;Bresnička reka&quot;, &quot;Lađevačka reka&quot;); at this point, the river enters the low valley of Zapadno Pomoravlje, meanders and floods often, so from now on the major settlements will be further from the river (Goričani, Lađevci, Mrčajevci).
* between the Kotlenik mountain and the Gruža region (north) and the Stolovi mountains (south); the town of Kraljevo and its suburbs of Adrani and Ratina are located south of the river, where the Ibar empties into the West Morava from the right; also from the right it receives the &quot;Tovarnica&quot; and from the left, the Gruža.
* between the mountains of Gledićke planine (north) and Goč (south); the most famous Serbian spa, Vrnjačka Banja, its suburbs of Vrnjci and Novo Selo, the industrial town of Trstenik and the monastery of Ljubostinja are located in this section.
* between the regions of Temnić (north) and Rasina (south); several large villages are located north of the river (Medveđa, Velika Drenova, Kukljin, Bošnjane, while the village of Globoder, town of Kruševac and its suburbs of Jasika, Pepeljevac, Parunovac and Čitluk are located south of it. North of the small town of Stalać, the West and Južna Morava meet and form the Great Morava.

== Economy ==

The West Morava river valley, Zapadno Pomoravlje, is economically the most developed of all three Morava river valleys. With the valley of the Ibar, the West Morava has a huge potential in electricity production (the Ovčar (6 MW) and Međuvršje (7 MW) hydroelectric power plants). Water is also used for the irrigation and for the same purpose the artificial lake Parmenac is created on the river, thus helping the already fertile region (grains, orchards). Also, out of all three Morava rivers, the West Morava&#x27;s valley is the most forested one.

The watershed of the West Morava is rich in ores, (the Ibar section most of all), and includes the mining of hard coal, magnesite, chromium, etc. As a result, the industry is very developed with a string of heavily industrialized towns: Užice, Požega, Čačak, Kraljevo, Trstenik and Kruševac. The traffic is also important for the economy as the whole of the river valley is a natural route for both the roads and the railways connecting eastern, central and western Serbia.

== Characteristics ==

Altogether, the West Morava receives 85 tributaries. The river used to be longer (319 km), but due to the regulation of the flow, it is shorter now.

The West Morava has an average discharge of 120 m3/s, but it is characterized by extreme fluctuations, which results in severe floods.

The West Morava drains an area of 15,754 km2 (41.2% of the entire Great Morava watershed), belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable. When melioration program began in 1966, it was projected that it will become navigable from Kruševac to Čačak.

In the central section of the flow, the special nature reserve Osredak was established in February 2020, and placed under the state protection.

<text>Waverley is a suburb in the Eastern suburbs of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Waverley is located seven kilometres east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Waverley Council.

Waverley Council takes its name from the suburb but its administrative centre is located in the adjacent suburb of Bondi Junction, which is also a major commercial centre. Waverley is the highest point of altitude in Sydney&#x27;s Eastern Suburbs.

==History==

Waverley takes its name from a home built near Old South Head Road in 1827 by Barnett Levey (or Levy) (1798–1837). It was named Waverley House, after the title of his favourite book, &quot;Waverley&quot;, by author Sir Walter Scott. Waverley Municipality was proclaimed in June 1859. The house was a distinctive landmark and gave its name to the surrounding suburb.

Waverley Cemetery (South Head General Cemetery) was established in 1877 and is one of Australia&#x27;s most notable cemeteries due to its cliff-side location. The cemetery features the graves of several notable Australians including poet Henry Kendall and aviator Lawrence Hargrave.

Edina, a late Victorian mansion built on a grand scale in Birrell Street by Ebenezer Vickery for himself and his family, was completed around 1884. Vickery was a leading merchant and a prominent patron of the Methodist Church. Other buildings in the group include Banksia, Witchagil and the Nellie Vickery Memorial Chapel. Banksia and Witchagil are two-storey villas that Vickery built for his sons.

This distinguished group of Victorian buildings is now used as the War Memorial Hospital. Edina, Banksia and Witchagil are on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. Other heritage items in Waverley include the two weatherboard cottages in Judges Lane, off Bronte Road. A building in Waverley once collapsed into a large hole that swallowed ten houses and an entire street.

<text>Mysore Medical College and Research Institute (previously called Mysore Medical College, abbreviated MMC), also known as Government Medical College, Mysuru is one of the oldest medical colleges in India. It is located in the heart of the city of Mysuru adjacent to the Mysuru city railway station. Founded in 1924 by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV, it is the first medical college to be established in the Karnataka region and the seventh in India. The college is affiliated to the Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences, Bengaluru.

==History==

Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar IV founded Mysore Medical College. Since there were no medical institutions in the erstwhile Kingdom of Mysore, a scheme for giving medical education was started in 1881 under which carefully the selected students were given scholarship and sent to places like Madras and Bombay to undergo training and to return and work as &quot;Hospital Assistants&quot;.

After the Madras Presidency expressed its inability to admit Mysore State students, the Government of Mysore sanctioned another scheme in April 1917 including a &quot;Mysore Medical School&quot;, which was started at Bangalore to train the then called &quot;Sub Assistant Surgeons&quot;. Trainees had to undergo a course for 4 years to qualify as a Licensed Medical Practitioner (LMP). In 1924 the &quot;Mysore Medical School&quot; was upgraded and was now called the &quot;Mysore Medical College&quot;. The college was affiliated to the University of Mysore and the trainees were now granted medical degrees. Mysore Medical College was the first medical college in the state of Mysore and only the seventh in India at this time. At the request and insistence of Sri Krishnadevaraja Wodiyar the college was shifted from Bangalore to Mysore in 1930.

The foundation stone was laid in 1930 by Sri Krishnadevaraja Wodiyar and the main building was constructed by Boraiah Basavaiah &amp; Sons, a famous contractor of Mysore. It was further expanded in 1940.

The Krishnarajendra Hospital (K R Hospital) was constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,65,000/- and started as a 100 bedded hospital with X-ray apparatus. It is attached to the Mysore Medical College.

The Mysore Medical School continued functioning in Bangalore for a few years and was eventually shut down two years after Bangalore Medical College came into existence in 1954.

Cheluvamba hospital, earlier known as Vanivilas Hospital, was built in 1880 with 24 beds, and was upgraded to a 200-bed hospital in 1939. It was further expanded in 1954 and the new OPD Block of OBG was built in 1997. New facilities have been continuously added onto the existing infrastructure, but the most impressive of all is the new multistoried OPD building with its ultra-modern air-conditioned ICCU which along with the medical wards on upper floors was added onto the K R Hospital complex in 1998. Other relatively new structures include a blood bank and a burns ward. It is attached to the Mysore Medical College.

<doc id="1113326" wikidata="Q1383387" url="?curid=1113326" title="United National Independence Party">
<text>The United National Independence Party (UNIP) is a political party in Zambia. It governed the country from 1964 to 1991 under the socialist presidency of Kenneth Kaunda, and was the sole legal party in the country between 1973 and 1990. On 4 April 2021, Bishop Trevor Mwamba was elected President of UNIP.

==History==
UNIP was founded in October 1959 by Mainza Chona as a successor of the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC), banned earlier that year. UNIP was initially led Chona as the ZANC leader, Kaunda, had been imprisoned. Kaunda later assumed power as leader of UNIP after he was released from prison in 1960.

In the general elections, UNIP won 14 seats, in second position, the first being taken by United Federal Party (UFP). Although Northern Rhodesian African National Congress leader Harry Nkumbula had made a secret electoral pact with the UFP, he later opted to form a government with UNIP. After a convincing victory in the Northern Rhodesian general elections in 1964, when UNIP won 55 of the 75 seats, Kaunda became Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia, leading the country to independence on 24 October 1964, when he became president.

In the 1968 general elections, Kaunda was re-elected president with 82% of the vote, and UNIP won 81 of the 105 elected seats in the National Assembly.

In 1973, the country became a one-party state with UNIP as the sole legal party, with an amended constitution being promulgated on 25 August 1973. The general election that year described as the final steps in achieving what was called a &quot;one-party participatory democracy&quot;. National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of UNIP. According to the constitution, UNIP&#x27;s president was selected at the party&#x27;s general conference, and the second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP&#x27;s secretary general. The constitution also stipulated that UNIP&#x27;s president was the sole candidate for president of the republic; he was confirmed in office every five years via a yes/no referendum. Voters chose between multiple UNIP candidates for the 125 parliamentary seats, with three candidates running in each constituency. Kaunda was confirmed as president with 89% of the vote. Elections were held under the same system in 1978, 1983 and 1988, with Kaunda receiving at least 80% of the vote each time.

At the end of 1990, multi-party democracy was reintroduced, and UNIP was roundly defeated in the 1991 general elections by the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD); Kaunda was defeated in the presidential vote by MMD candidate Frederick Chiluba, receiving just 24% of the vote, whilst in the National Assembly elections UNIP won 25 seats to the MMD&#x27;s 125.

Following changes to the constitution which effectively barred Kaunda from running for president again, UNIP boycotted the 1996 elections, although two members contested National Assembly seats. The party returned to contest the 2001 elections with Kenneth Kaunda&#x27;s son, Tilyenji, as its presidential candidate; he received 10% of the vote, finishing fourth out of the eleven candidates. In the National Assembly elections, the party won 13 seats.

Prior to the 2006 elections, the party joined the United Democratic Alliance alongside the other two largest opposition parties. United Party for National Development leader, Hakainde Hichilema, was the alliance&#x27;s presidential candidate, finishing third. The alliance won just 26 seats in the National Assembly, down from the 74 the three parties had won in 2001.

UNIP did not contest the 2008 presidential by-election, but nominated Tilyenji Kaunda as its presidential candidate for the 2011 elections. Kaunda received less than 1% of the vote, finishing sixth in a field of ten candidates. The party also failed to win a seat in the National Assembly, receiving only 0.7% of the vote. Kaunda ran in the 2015 presidential by-election, but again received less than 1% of the vote. Tilyenji Kaunda remained the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for the 2016 general elections, but he received only 0.24% of the vote, with the party again failing to win a seat in the National Assembly.

<doc id="1113331" wikidata="Q425097" url="?curid=1113331" title="Acepromazine">
<text>Acepromazine, acetopromazine, or acetylpromazine (commonly known as ACP, Ace, or by the trade names Atravet or Acezine 2, number depending on mg/ml dose) is a phenothiazine derivative antipsychotic drug. It was used in humans during the 1950s as an antipsychotic, but is now almost exclusively used on animals as a sedative and antiemetic. A closely related analogue, chlorpromazine, is still used in humans.

The standard pharmaceutical preparation, acepromazine maleate, is used in veterinary medicine in dogs and cats. It is used widely in horses as a pre-anesthetic sedative and has been shown to reduce anesthesia related death. However, it should be used with caution (but is not absolutely contraindicated) in stallions due to the risk of paraphimosis and priapism. Its potential for cardiac effects can be profound, namely hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation, so it should be avoided or used with caution in geriatric or debilitated animals.

==Pharmacology==
The clinical pharmacology of acepromazine is similar to that of other phenothiazine derived anti-psychotic agents. The primary behavioral effects are attributed to its potent antagonism of post-synaptic D2 receptors and, to a lesser degree, the other D2-like receptors. Additional effects are related to its appreciable antagonistic effects on various other receptors, including the α1-adrenergic receptors, H1 receptors, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. It is metabolized by the liver, oxidized to produce its primary metabolite, hydroxyethylpromazine sulfoxide, which is then excreted in the urine. Its action at the chemoreceptor trigger zone (in the area postrema) and the solitary nucleus (in the medulla oblongata) allow it to have an antiemetic effect.

==Veterinary use==

===Canine and feline===
The most common uses of acepromazine in animals are as an oral sedative before stressful events (such as thunderstorms), an injectable tranquilizer for particularly aggressive or fractious animals, and in combination with analgesics and other sedatives. It is also labeled for use in preventing motion sickness. Its effects as a CNS depressant means that fewer opiates are required to reach the same amount of sedation, and it prevents the arrhythmia and vomiting that many opiates induce.

====Adverse effects in cats====
While acepromazine is also used in cats, its absorption is erratic and can vary between individuals. It also generally induces less sedation than in dogs. It also causes spontaneous motor activity (in both cats and dogs, but more often in cats) by blocking dopamine receptors in the striatum and substantia nigra.

====Adverse effects in dogs====
Literature from the 1950s raised concerns about phenothiazine-induced seizures in human patients. For this reason, caution has typically been advised when contemplating acepromazine use in epileptic canine patients, as it was widely believed to lower the seizures threshold. More current studies, however, have failed to show a positive association between use of acepromazine and seizure activity and show a possible role for acepromazine in seizure control: in a retrospective study at University of Tennessee, acepromazine was administered for tranquilization to 36 dogs with a prior history of seizures and to decrease seizure activity in 11 dogs. No seizures were seen within 16 hours of acepromazine administration in the 36 dogs that received the drug, and the seizures abated for 1.5 to 8 hours (n=6) or did not recur (n=2) in eight of 10 dogs that were actively seizing. Excitement-induced seizures were reduced for 2 months in one dog. A second retrospective study also concluded that administration of acepromazine to dogs with prior or acute seizure history did not potentiate seizures, and there was some trend toward seizure reduction. The original seizure cautions reported in the 1950s were in human patients on relatively high doses of the antipsychotic chlorpromazine while the doses of acepromazine used in the two published veterinary studies cited above are much lower.
In some boxers, acepromazine can cause vasovagal syncope (due to a decreased stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system) and hypotension (due to vasodilation), leading to collapse. This may occur only in certain families of boxers, but the unknown risk to an individual dog means that acepromazine should be used at reduced doses, or not at all, in this breed. Individual dogs of any breed can have a profound reaction characterized by hypotension, especially if there is an underlying heart problem.

In giant-breed dogs and sighthounds, the sedative effects of acepromazine may last for 12–24 hours, which is much longer than the usual 3–4 hours.

====Dogs with a mutation in the &quot;ABCB1&quot; (&quot;MDR1&quot;) gene====
P-glycoprotein (P-gp), also known as multidrug resistant protein 1 (MDR1), is a protein found in cell membranes which is important in the metabolism and excretion of some drugs, such as acepromazine and ivermectin. This protein is encoded by the &quot;ABCB1&quot; gene (previously known as the &quot;MDR1&quot; gene). A mutation in &quot;ABCB1&quot; prevents P-gp from being correctly produced, so that dogs with this mutation have an increased sensitivity to drugs (such as acepromazine) which are substrates of P-gp. Dogs which are heterozygous (that is, which have one functioning &quot;ABCB1&quot; gene, and one non-functioning gene) are less sensitive to acepromazine than dogs which are homozygous (that is, which have two copies of the mutant gene). 75% of Collies carry the mutated &quot;ABCB1&quot; gene, as do 50% of Australian Shepherds. Other affected breeds include: Border Collie, English Shepherd, German Shepherd, Old English Sheepdog, and Sighthounds, shelties, long haired greyhound.

Tests for this mutation are available.

===Equine===
In equine surgery, premedication with acepromazine has been shown to reduce the perianaesthetic mortality rate, possibly due to its actions as a sedative and anxiolytic. It is less effective as a sedative if the horse is already excited.

Additionally, acepromazine is used as a vasodilator in the treatment of laminitis, where an oral dose equivalent to &quot;mild sedation&quot; is commonly used, although the dose used is highly dependent on the treating veterinarian. While it is shown to elicit vasodilation in the distal limb, evidence showing its efficacy at increasing perfusion in the laminae is lacking. It is also sometimes used to treat a horse experiencing equine exertional rhabdomyolysis.

Acepromazine should not be used in horses intended for human consumption.

====Adverse effects====
Side effects are not common, but the use of acepromazine in stallions should be used with caution (but is not absolutely contraindicated) due to the risk of paraphimosis and priapism.

Acepromazine also lowers blood pressure, and should therefore be used with caution in horses that are experiencing anemia, dehydration, shock, or colic. It should not be used in horses dewormed with piperazine.

<text>The All People&#x27;s Congress (APC) is one of the two major political parties in Sierra Leone, the other being its main political rival the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP). The APC has been the main opposition party in Sierra Leone since 4 April 2018 when Julius Maada Bio of the SLPP won the 2018 presidential elections, though it maintains a majority in parliament.

The APC party was founded in 1960 by a breakaway group from the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party that vehemently opposed elections before independence and instead supported independence before elections. The APC governed the country from 1968 to 1992 and became the ruling party again in 2007 after the party presidential candidate Ernest Bai Koroma won the 2007 presidential election, he contested and also won the 2012 elections. The APC lost power on 4 April 2018, with its flagbearer Samura Kamara losing the presidential election to Bio.

The APC is very popular and receives large majority support in almost all of the northern districts of Sierra Leone with strong ties to the Temne and some Limba people. The APC is also popular with significant majority in the Western Area (including Freetown).

== Overview ==
Following a heavily manipulated plebiscite in 1978, the APC became the sole legal party in the country, a status it retained until 1991. Presidents Siaka Stevens and Joseph Saidu Momoh were members of the APC. Momoh was overthrown in a military coup in 1992, and during the civil war that followed, the party was severely weakened.

In the parliamentary election held on 14 May 2002, the party won 19.8% of the popular vote and 22 out of 112 seats. Its candidate in the presidential elections, Ernest Bai Koroma, won 22.3% of the vote; he was defeated by Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of the Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP).
For several years Koroma&#x27;s leadership was challenged by some in the party, who took the issue to court; the dispute was said to be resolved in April 2007, with Koroma accepted by party dissidents as the party&#x27;s leader ahead of the 2007 election. He was the party&#x27;s candidate for president in the election, with the first round held in August 2007. In the first round he took first place with 44.3% of the vote, ahead of Solomon Berewa of the ruling Sierra Leone People&#x27;s Party (SLPP) with 38.3%, but Koroma did not receive enough votes to win outright, and a second round was necessary. In the parliamentary election, held concurrently with the presidential first round, the APC won 59 out of 112 seats and became the largest party in Parliament.

Koroma was victorious in the second round of the 2007 presidential election, held on 8 September, winning 54.6% of the vote against 45.4% for Berewa. He was sworn in as President on 17 September.

APC has traditionally been based among the Temne and Limba people in the north.

In 2018 the party named a team whowould review the country&#x27;s constitution. Although the plan was to not have new elections for five years the party wanted to suggest a new constitution. The members chosen included Elvis Kargbo, Dauda S. Kamara, Eddie Turay and Osman Foday Yansaneh, Abu Bakarr Kalokoh, Daniel Koroma, Africanus Sorie Sesay esq, Amadu Koroma, Ibrahim I. Mansaray, Ibrahim Sorie esq, Isata Kabia, Lansana Dumbuya, Lawyer Showers, Roland Nylander, Sulaiman Kabba Koroma, Warah Serry-Kamal and Sorie Tarawallie. The group had several more members and a draft was expected by the end of January 2019.

He now works for the investigative journalism site &quot;Declassified UK&quot;.

==Early life and education==
He was born to Lt. Seymour Norton-Taylor, R.A., and Gweneth Joan Powell (died 9 January 1978).

Norton-Taylor was educated at The King&#x27;s School in Canterbury, Kent, going on to study at Hertford College, a constituent college of the University of Oxford, and the College of Europe in Bruges.

==Career==
He was the European Community and Brussels correspondent for both &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; between 1967 and 1975, while also contributing to &quot;The Economist&quot; and the &quot;Financial Times&quot;.

Norton-Taylor joined &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1975, concentrating on Whitehall, official secrecy, and behind-the-scenes decision-making. He became an expert on British and Soviet intelligence activities during the Second World War. In 1988, he made an extended appearance on the TV discussion programme &quot;After Dark&quot;, alongside (among others) Harold Musgrove, Hilary Wainwright and George Brumwell, discussing his book &quot;Blacklist: The Inside Story of Political Vetting&quot;, co-written with Mark Hollingsworth.

He has written several plays based on transcripts of public inquiries, including &quot;The Colour of Justice&quot; (1999), based on the hearing of the MacPherson Inquiry into the police conduct of the investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Another was &quot;Justifying War: Scenes from the Hutton Inquiry&quot; (2003), both of which premiered at the Tricycle Theatre.

Norton-Taylor left &quot;The Guardian&quot; in July 2016 and currently writes for &quot;Declassified UK&quot;.

==Awards==
In 1986 Norton-Taylor won the Freedom of Information Campaign award. That same year he was prevented initially by a court injunction from reporting the contents of &quot;Spycatcher&quot; (1987), the memoirs of Peter Wright, a former MI5 agent. The government&#x27;s injunction was dismissed in the High Court by Lord Justice Scott.

Norton-Taylor was one of the few journalists to cover the Scott Inquiry from start to finish. His play, &quot;Half the Picture&quot;, based on the inquiry, received a 1994 &quot;Time Out&quot; Drama, Comedy and Dance award for its &quot;brave initiative&quot;.

In 2010, with fellow &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Ian Cobain, he was awarded a Human Rights Campaign of the Year Award from Liberty for their &quot;investigation into Britain&#x27;s complicity in the use of torture&quot; by the United States against detainees at their facility at Guantanamo Bay and at black sites.

==Personal life==
In 1967, he married Anna C Rendle. He has two children and five grandchildren. His son Hugo is a judge of the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber).

Norton-Taylor is a Member of Council of the Royal United Services Institute and a trustee of the Civil Liberties Trust and the London Action Trust.

<text>Mansoor Hekmat (, born Zhoobin Razani ; June 4, 1951 – July 4, 2002) was an Iranian Marxist, revolutionary and leader of the Worker-communist movement. He opposed the Shah and, after the 1979 Revolution, he first founded the movement of Revolutionary Marxism and in 1983 he co-founded the Communist Party of Iran which was opposed to the Islamic Republic of Iran. In 1991 he separated from this party and founded the Worker-communist Party of Iran (WPI), which he led until his death in 2002. He was the husband of fellow politician Azar Majedi.

==Life==
Born in Tehran, Hekmat moved to Shiraz, where he graduated in economics at the University of Shiraz, before moving to the UK where completed his Masters at Bath University. He moved to London in 1973 to start his Phd at Birkbeck University, where he studied under the supervision of Marxist theorist Ben Fine and became a critic of what he saw as distorted versions of communism, including Russian communism, Chinese communism, the guerrilla warfare movement, social democracy, Trotskyism and nationalism among the left.

He founded the Union of Communist Militants in 1979, then took part in the Iranian Revolution of 1979 – marked by the creation of workers&#x27; councils (&quot;shoras&quot;) – and, unlike the major part of the Iranian left-wing, refused to pay allegiance to Islamism and Supreme Leader Ruhollah Khomeini. He denounced the &quot;myth of a progressive national bourgeoisie&quot;.
Because of mounting repression against political opposition groups in Iran, Hekmat sought refuge in Kurdistan in 1982. Hekmat&#x27;s Union then fused with a Kurdish group of Maoist roots, Komalah – together, they formed the Communist Party of Iran (CPI) based on Revolutionary Marxism. Hekmat and a group of other CPI members left the party and, in 1991, founded the WPI. He also helped establish the Worker-Communist Party of Iraq.

He died of cancer in hospital in the UK and his headstone is at Highgate Cemetery, a few meters away from Karl Marx&#x27;s grave.

==Views==
Hekmat supported the &quot;return to Marx&quot;, and theorized that the working class is to rely only on itself – arguing that it had been the only class to impose beneficial changes in the 20th century. He opposed Stalinism and never accepted that either the Soviet Union or the People&#x27;s Republic of China were socialist countries. He famously said &quot;The basis of Socialism is the human being&quot;. Hekmat was also a practicing vegetarian and towards the end of his life became vegan.

Hekmat believed in free, legalised abortions but encouraged criticism of the strong feminist movements of his time whom he criticized as having a lack of compassion on this matter. He believed all should be done to create a world in which women are supported socially, economically, culturally and politically to keep their children, to reduce the need for abortions.
