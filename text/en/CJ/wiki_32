<text>Sinophone, which means &quot;Chinese-speaking&quot;, typically refers to an individual who speaks at least one variety of Chinese (that is, one of the Sinitic languages). Academic writers often use the term Sinophone in two definitions: either specifically &quot;Chinese-speaking populations where it is a minority language, excluding mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan&quot; or generally &quot;Chinese-speaking areas, including where it is an official language&quot;. Many authors use the collocation Sinophone world or Chinese-speaking world to mean the Chinese-speaking world itself (consisting of Greater China and Singapore) or the distribution of the Chinese diaspora outside of Greater China.

Mandarin Chinese is the most commonly spoken variety of the Chinese language today, with over 1 billion total speakers (approximately 12% of the world population), of which about 900 million are native speakers, making it the most spoken first language in the world and second most spoken overall. It is the official variety of Chinese in mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Meanwhile, Cantonese is the official variety of Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau and is also widely spoken among significant overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia as well as the rest of the world.

==Etymology==

The etymology of stems from &quot;&quot; &quot;China; Chinese&quot; (cf. Sinology) and &quot;&quot; &quot;speaker of a certain language&quot; (e.g. Anglophone, Francophone).

Edward McDonald (2011) claimed the word &quot;sinophone&quot; &quot;seems to have been coined separately and simultaneously on both sides of the Pacific&quot; in 2005, by Geremie Barmé of Australia National University and Shu-mei Shih of UCLA. Barmé (2008) explained the &quot;Sinophone world&quot; as &quot;one consisting of the individuals and communities who use one or another—or, indeed, a number—of China-originated languages and dialects to make meaning of and for the world, be it through speaking, reading, writing or via an engagement with various electronic media.&quot; Shih (2004:29) noted, &quot;By &#x27;sinophone&#x27; literature I mean literature written in Chinese by Chinese-speaking writers in various parts of the world outside China, as distinguished from &#x27;Chinese literature&#x27;—literature from China.&quot;

Nevertheless, there are two earlier &quot;sinophone&quot; usages. Ruth Keen (1988:231) defined &quot;Sinophone communities&quot; in Chinese literature as &quot;the Mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Indonesia and the U.S.&quot; Coulombe and Roberts (2001:12) compared students of French between &quot;anglophones&quot; &quot;with English as their mother tongue&quot; and &quot;allophones&quot; (in the Quebec English sense) &quot;without English or French as their mother tongue&quot;, including &quot;sinophones&quot; defined as &quot;Cantonese/Mandarin speakers&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; does not yet include &quot;Sinophone&quot;, but records 1900 as the earliest usage of the French loanwords &quot;Francophone&quot; for &quot;French-speaking&quot; and &quot;Anglophone&quot; for &quot;English-speaking&quot;. The French language – which first used &quot;Sinophone&quot; to mean &quot;Chinese-speaking&quot; in 1983 (CNRTL 2012) – differentiates &#x27; meaning &quot;French-speaking, especially in a region where two or more languages are spoken&quot; and &#x27; &quot;French-speaking, collectively, the French-speaking world&quot; (commonly abbreviating the ). Haun Saussy contrasted the English lexicon lacking an inclusive term like &quot;Sinophonie&quot; or &quot;Sinophonia&quot;, and thus using &quot;Sinophone&quot; to mean both &quot;Chinese-speaking, especially in a region where it is a minority language&quot; and &quot;all Chinese-speaking areas, including China and Taiwan, Chinese-speaking world&quot;.

&quot;Sinophone&quot; operates as a calque on &quot;Francophone&quot;, as the application of the logic of Francophonie to the domain of Chinese extraterritorial speech. But that analogy is sure to hiccup, like all analogies, at certain points. Some, but not all, Francophone regions are populated by descendants of French emigrants, as virtually all of Sinophonia (I think) is populated by descendants of Chinese emigrants. Other regions, the majority in both area and population, are Francophone as a result of conquest or enslavement. That might be true of some areas of China too, but in a far more distant past. And at another level, the persistence of French had to do with the exportation of educational protocols by the Grande Nation herself, something that wasn&#x27;t obviously true of the Middle Kingdom in recent decades but now, with the Confucius Institutes, is perhaps taking form. (2012)

English &quot;Sinophonia&quot; was the theme of an international conference organized by Christopher Lupke, President of the Association of Chinese and Comparative Literature, and hosted by Peng Hsiao-yen, Senior Researcher in the Institute of Chinese Literature and Philosophy, (Academia Sinica 2012) on &quot;Global Sinophonia&quot; – Chinese &quot;Quanqiu Huayu Wenhua&quot; 全球華語文化 (literally &quot;global Chinese-language culture&quot;).

==Usages==
In the two decades since the English word &quot;sinophone&quot; was coined, it has gone through semantic change and increasing usage. Authors currently use it in at least two meanings, the general sense of &quot;Chinese-speaking&quot;, and the academic &quot;Chinese-speaking, especially in areas where it is a minority language.&quot; Shu-mei Shih, one of the leading academic authorities on Sinophone scholarship, summarized treatments.

In the past few years, scholars have used the term &quot;Sinophone&quot; for largely denotative purposes to mean &quot;Chinese-speaking&quot; or &quot;written in Chinese&quot;. Sau-ling Wong used it to designate Chinese American literature written in &quot;Chinese&quot; as opposed to English (&quot;Yellow&quot;); historians of the Manchu empire such as Pamela Kyle Crossley, Evelyn S. Rawski, and Jonathan Lipman described &quot;Chinese-speaking&quot; Hui Muslims in China as Sinophone Muslims as opposed to Uyghur Muslims, who speak Turkic languages; Patricia Schiaini- Vedani and Lara Maconi distinguished between Tibetan writers who write in the Tibetan script and &quot;Chinese-language&quot;, or Sinophone, Tibetan writers. Even though the main purpose of these scholars&#x27; use of the term is denotative, their underlying intent is to clarify contrast by naming: in highlighting a Sinophone Chinese American literature, Wong exposes the anglophone bias of scholars and shows that American literature is multilingual; Crossley, Rawski, and Lipman emphasize that Muslims in China have divergent languages, histories, and experiences; Schiaini- Vedani and Maconi suggest the predicament of Tibetan writers who write in the &quot;language of the colonizer&quot; and whose identity is bound up with linguistic difference. (2013:8)

=== General meanings ===
&quot;Chinese-speaking&quot; is the literal meaning of &quot;sinophone&quot;, without the academic distinction of speakers outside of Greater China.

The &quot;Wiktionary&quot; is one of the few dictionaries that define &quot;&quot;:
* adjective &quot;Speaking one or more Sinitic or Chinese language(s), Chinese-speaking&quot;
* noun &quot;a person who speaks one or more of the Sinitic or Chinese language(s) either natively or by adoption, a Chinese-speaking person.&quot;

=== Academic meanings ===
The word &quot;sinophone&quot; has different meanings among scholars in fields such as Sinology, linguistics, comparative literature, language teaching, and postcolonialism.

Recent definitions of the word include:
* The Sinophone encompasses Sinitic-language communities and their expressions (cultural, political, social, etc.) on the margins of nations and nationalness in the internal colonies and other minority communities in China as well as outside it, with the exception of settler colonies where the Sinophone is the dominant vis-à-vis their indigenous populations. (Shih 2011:716)
*The Sinophone world refers to Sinitic-language cultures and communities born of colonial and postcolonial histories on the margins of geopolitical nation-states all across the world. (Cambria 2012)

==Geographic distribution==
===Chinese-speaking countries===
Chinese is an official language of five countries and territories. While Chinese is a group of related languages rather than a single language itself, the governments of nearly all nations and territories where it is official simply designate the ambitious &quot;Chinese&quot; to refer to the official variant used in administration and education, with the exception of Singapore.

Mandarin is the sole official language of both the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) as well as one of the four official languages of Singapore. It is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. 

Cantonese is an official language of Hong Kong and Macau (alongside English and Portuguese respectively), where it is the dominant variety of Chinese rather than Mandarin.

===Overseas communities===
Overseas Chinese and Chinese-speaking communities are found worldwide, with the most sizable concentrated in much of Southeast Asia and some countries in the Western World, particularly the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, and France. The usage and varieties of Chinese among the Chinese diaspora is usually dependent on various factors, mostly the ancestral region of the dominant Chinese group and official language policy of the country of residence. In Southeast Asia, Cantonese and Hokkien are the dominant variants of Chinese, with the former traditionally serving as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; amongst most ethnic Chinese in the region. In Western countries with large ethnic Chinese populations, more established Chinese communities use Cantonese, although Mandarin is increasingly spoken by newer arrivals.

Malaysia is the only country outside of the Chinese-speaking world that permits the usage of Chinese as a medium of instruction. This is largely influenced by the fact that Malaysian Chinese comprise nearly a quarter of the country&#x27;s population and have traditionally been highly influential in the country&#x27;s economic sector. While Mandarin is the variant of Chinese used in Chinese-language schools, speakers of Hokkien form a plurality in the ethnic Chinese population and Cantonese serves as the common language, especially in commerce and media.

===As a foreign language===
With the economic and political rise of the Sinophone world since the latter half of the 20th century, particularly China itself starting in the 1980s, Mandarin Chinese has increasingly become a popular foreign language throughout the world. While not as widespread as a standard foreign language at the scale of English, French, Spanish, or German, student enrollment rates and courses in Mandarin have rapidly grown in East and Southeast Asia and Western countries. Besides standard Mandarin, Cantonese is the only other Chinese language that is widely taught as a foreign language, in part due to the global economic importance of Hong Kong and its widespread presence in significant Overseas Chinese communities.

===Statistics===
&quot;Ethnologue&quot; estimates the total number of Sinophones at about 1.4 billion worldwide as of 2020, the vast majority (1.3 billion) of whom are native speakers. The most spoken branch of Chinese is Mandarin with 1.12 billion speakers (921 million native speakers), followed by Yue (which includes Cantonese) with 85 million speakers (84 million native). Other branches of the Chinese language subgroup with over 2 million speakers include: Wu with 82 million (81.7 million native), Min Nan with 49 million (48.4 million native), Hakka with 48.2 million, Jin with 47 million, Xiang with 37.3 million, Gan with 22.1 million, Min Bei with 11 million, Min Dong with 10.3 million, Huizhou with 4.6 million, and Pu-Xian Min with 2.5 million.

<text>Hattingen is a town in the northern part of the Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis district, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==History==

Hattingen is located on the south bank of the River Ruhr in the south of the Ruhr region. The town was first mentioned in 1396, when the Duke of Mark granted permission to build a city wall. Today, Hattingen has a picturesque historic district with &quot;Fachwerk&quot; (timber-framed houses) built between the 14th and 16th centuries. The old city is still partly surrounded by the city walls today.

There are three castles remaining within the municipal area of Hattingen. Isenburg Castle was built in the 12th century in the hillsides above the Ruhr. The castle was destroyed in 1225, but prominent ruins remain. Blankenstein Castle was built in the 13th century above the Ruhr river and Haus Kemnade is a moated castle from the 16th century. All three castles are famous tourist landmarks and open to the public.

Hattingen became part of the Hanseatic League in 1554 and became an important trading town. In 1720, there were 52 operating coal mines within the municipal area and Hattingen became one of the first industrial cities of the Ruhr region. Steel production started in 1853, when the Henrichshütte was founded. The Henrichshütte became one of the most important employers of the whole region and dominated the town until it closed in 1987.

Today, Hattingen still faces problems concerning structural change of the economy, but is becoming a centre of tourism, especially its historical downtown.

<doc id="1090562" wikidata="Q633180" url="?curid=1090562" title="Krzysztof Komeda">
<text>Krzysztof Trzciński (27 April 1931 – 23 April 1969), known professionally as Krzysztof Komeda, was a Polish film score composer and jazz pianist widely regarded as one of the most influential Polish jazz musicians. He is best known for writing the scores for Roman Polanski’s films &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; (1962), &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966), &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1967), and &quot;Rosemary’s Baby&quot; (1968).

Komeda&#x27;s album &quot;Astigmatic&quot; (1965) is often considered one of the most important European jazz albums. British critic Stuart Nicholson describes the album as &quot;marking a shift away from the dominant American approach with the emergence of a specific European aesthetic.&quot; Komeda is also known for blending jazz with classical and traditional Polish music.

==Life and career==
===Early life and education===
He was born Krzysztof Trzciński on 27 April 1931 in Poznań to father Mieczysław and mother Zenobia (née Gębicka). He chose Komeda as his stage name only upon graduation from university as a means of distancing himself as a jazz musician from his daytime job in a medical clinic.

He grew up in Częstochowa and Ostrów Wielkopolski where in 1950 he graduated from the &#x27;liceum (high school) for Boys&#x27;. While at school, he participated in the Music and Poetry Club. After high school he entered the Medical Academy in Poznań to study medicine. He finished his six-year-long studies and obtained a medical doctor diploma in 1956. He chose to specialize as an otolaryngology physician.

He took music lessons from early childhood; to become a virtuoso was his dream. He became a member of the Poznań conservatorium at the age of eight, but World War II thwarted his plans. Komeda explored the theory of music, and learned to play piano, during this period and later, until 1950; however, he was aware of the loss of the past six years.

===Career beginnings===
Komeda was interested in light and dance music. He met Witold Kujawski, a graduate of the same school and active as a swing bass player, at the gymnasium (high school) in Ostrów Wielkopolski. It was Kujawski who acquainted Komeda-Trzciński with jazz, and took him to Kraków. The romantic period of Polish jazz, called the catacombs, had its day in the spotlight. Jam sessions, in which such musicians as Matuszkiewicz, Borowiec, Walasek and Kujawski himself participated, took place in Witold&#x27;s small apartment in Kraków.

Several years later, it became clear why Komeda was fascinated with be-bop performed by Andrzej Trzaskowski. The fascination with jazz and the friendship with other musicians strengthened his connections with music, even though he was a doctor by profession. He worked for some time with the first, postwar, pioneer Polish jazz band, a group called Melomani that was from Kraków and Łódź, whose mainstays were Matuszkiewicz, Trzaskowski and Kujawski.

Later, he played with pop groups from Poznań. One of them, Jerzy Grzewiński&#x27;s group, soon transformed into a dixieland band. Komeda appeared with Grzewiński on the I Jazz Festival in Sopot in August 1956, but he achieved success performing with saxophonist Jan &quot;Ptaszyn&quot; Wróblewski and vibraphonist Jerzy Milian, because dixieland did not meet Komeda&#x27;s expectations at the time. He was more fascinated with modern jazz. Thanks to this passion, the Komeda Sextet was created. Krzysztof Trzciński used the stage name &#x27;Komeda&#x27; for the first time when he worked at a laryngological clinic, and wanted to conceal his interest in jazz from co-workers. Jazz was beginning its struggle for respectability with the communist authorities in the era of &quot;The Thaw&quot; and with Polish society and was gradually recognized by both. In the 1960s, jazz musicians started to be invited to prominent concert halls in Warsaw.

The Komeda Sextet became the first Polish jazz group playing modern jazz, and its pioneering performances opened the way for jazz in Poland. He played jazz that related to European traditions and which was the combination of the two of the most popular American groups at that time: the Modern Jazz Quartet and the Gerry Mulligan Quartet.

In the thirteen years after the I Sopot Jazz Festival, the artistic personality of Krzysztof Trzciński became more mature, crystallized and lyrically poetic. Komeda was a constantly searching poet who could find ways of individual expression of himself within jazz, Slavic lyricism, European sensibility and in the traditions of Polish music.

===1960s===

The years 1956–1962 saw Komeda with his group taking part in domestic festivals and preparing ambitious programs. These were also the years of his first foreign successes in Moscow, Grenoble and Paris. A &quot;Jazz and Poetry&quot; programme was prepared for Jazz Jamboree &#x27;60, and later in Warsaw Philharmonic. Komeda&#x27;s adventure with film music also began by this time. Scores for the films of Roman Polanski such as &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; (1962), of Andrzej Wajda such as &quot;Innocent Sorcerers&quot; (1960), and of Janusz Morgenstern &quot;Good Bye, Till Tomorrow&quot; (also 1960) were created. This period, which in Komeda&#x27;s artistic biography can be called the period of growing up and improving his own music language, was crowned with &quot;Ballet Etudes&quot; performed on Jazz Jamboree ’62. Although the reaction of domestic critics for the Etudes was rather cold, it opened the doors to Europe for Komeda.

Komeda visited Scandinavia for the first time in spring 1960, and he went back there every year thereafter. All of his performances at the &#x27;Gyllene Cirkeln&#x27; (Golden Circle) in Stockholm and at the Montmartre Jazz Club in Copenhagen were a success. The Danish director Hennig Carlsen ordered music for his movies &quot;Hvad Med Os&quot; and &quot;Sult&quot; (the movie based on Knut Hamsun&#x27;s novel &quot;Hunger&quot;). Komeda also wrote the music for Henning Carlsen&#x27;s film &quot;The Cats&quot; (&quot;Kattorna&quot;, 1965). Overall Komeda wrote more than 70 soundtracks. After successes in Scandinavia, came further successes: jazz festivals in Prague, Blend, Koenigsberg; tours of Bulgaria and both West and East Germany. Komeda stayed in Los Angeles in 1968 where he composed film music for Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary’s Baby&quot; (with one of his most recognizable compositions, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Lullaby&quot; sung by Mia Farrow) and Buzz Kulik&#x27;s &quot;Riot&quot;.

===Accident and death===
In December 1968, in Los Angeles, Komeda had a tragic accident which led to a haematoma of the brain. He was pushed off an escarpment by writer Marek Hłasko during a drinking party. Roman Polański mentioned in his memoirs that as a result of friendly rough-and-tumble with Marek Hłasko, Komeda fell down and suffered head injuries. Medical treatment in the US hospital did not save his life. After being transported home to Poland in a coma and in a terminal state, he died in April 1969, aged 37. Hłasko, who was tormented by a sense of guilt, himself died just two months later at the age of 35. Komeda was buried at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.

==Remembrance==

As a jazz musician, he exerted a crucial influence on creating an original style, often described as the Polish school of jazz, which subsequently influenced the Polish jazz scene&#x27;s development after his death. Since 1995, the Komeda Jazz Festival has been held on a regular basis, including an International Composers&#x27; Competition. The goal of the competition is to promote young artists.

In 1991, a street named in honour of Komeda was opened in Warsaw in the Mokotów District.

In 2008, a commemorative plaque in honour of Komeda was unveiled on the building of the National Bank of Poland in Warsaw. Another commemorative plaque was unveiled in Częstochowa in 2024.

In 2010, the National Bank of Poland issued a commemorative coin dedicated to Komeda in the &quot;Polish Popular Music&quot; series. The same year, a statue honoring the composer was ceremonially unveiled in Poznań.

In 2012, a crater on the planet Mercury was named in honor of Komeda by the International Astronomical Union.

Between 2019–2020, a series of concerts titled &quot;The Road to Hollywood. Krzysztof Komeda. 50th Anniversary&quot; took place in numerous locations across the whole of Poland.

<text>Raymond Joseph Perrault, (February 6, 1926 – November 24, 2008) was a Canadian politician. He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia and of the Senate of Canada.

Perrault was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, a family with strong Liberal roots. His maternal grandfather came from Ontario and enlisted to quell the Metis rebellion led by Louis Riel. His paternal grandfather came from Quebec, where Riel had been a hero. Perrault was educated at Sir Guy Carleton school and John Oliver high school in Vancouver.

After graduating from the University of British Columbia with degrees in economics and political science, he became a communications consultant, working in radio, public relations and advertising. He entered politics in his thirties, becoming leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party in 1959. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia in the 1960 provincial election in which the Liberals won fours seats in the legislature (an increase from two in the previous election), and won 20.9% of the popular vote.

In the 1963 election, the Liberals gained one more Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), for a total of five, while their share of the popular vote fell to 19.98%. In Perrault&#x27;s final election as leader in 1966, the party won an additional seat, and a modest increase in the vote to 20.24%.

He remained an MLA until he resigned in 1968 to enter federal politics in the 1968 federal election. He won a seat in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), defeating New Democratic Party leader Tommy Douglas by just 138 votes, earning him the nickname &quot;Landslide Ray&quot;. He was defeated in the next election in 1972.

Perrault was appointed to the Senate by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau in October 1973. A year later, he joined the cabinet as Leader of the Government in the Senate.

When the Liberals lost power in the 1979 election, Perrault became Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. He resumed his position as government leader when the Liberals returned to power in the 1980 election. In 1982, he was reassigned to the position of Minister of State for Fitness and Amateur Sport, and served in that position until leaving cabinet in August 1983.

He remained in the Senate until his retirement in 2001.

Perrault served on the board of the Terry Fox Foundation. A lifelong follower of sports, Perrault served as a director of the Vancouver Canucks and honorary chairman of the Vancouver Canadians baseball team. In the 1980s, he was part of a failed effort to bring a Major League Baseball team to Vancouver.

He died on November 24, 2008, at the age of 82, leaving behind his wife Barbara and their three children.

<doc id="1090574" wikidata="Q5185734" url="?curid=1090574" title="Crinan, Argyll">
<text>Crinan () is a small village located on the west coast of Scotland in the region known as Knapdale, which is part of Argyll and Bute.
Before the Crinan Canal was built, Crinan was named Port Righ which meant the king&#x27;s port. The canal was named from the small settlement of Crinan Ferry on the edge of Loch Crinan where a small ferry landed. The name Crinan probably derives from the Creones tribe who lived in the area in 140 AD. 
The canal starts at Ardrishaig sea loch on Loch Gilp, and ends away at Crinan sea loch on the Sound of Jura. The canal was designed to provide a short cut between the west coast and islands at one end and the Clyde estuary at the other, and so avoid the long voyage around the south end of the Kintyre Peninsula.

By the canal basin is a coffee shop and the nearby hotel and looks out across Loch Crinan to Duntrune Castle. Crinan Post Office is in the old Harbour House. Crinan Boatyard provides services and facilities for commercial and leisure boaters. A scallop farming business operates from the loch. The Crinan Wood is home to ferns, lichens and 24 species of bird.

Parts of the TV series &quot;The Tales of Para Handy&quot; were filmed here.

The village of Chorleywood is in the Three Rivers district of Hertfordshire about from London. Chorleywood station is also served by Chiltern Railways, which runs trains from London Marylebone station through to Aylesbury.

==History==
The station was built by expanding the local train station and was opened as &quot;Chorley Wood&quot; in July 1889. The name was changed to &quot;Chorley Wood &amp; Chenies&quot; in November 1915 until 1934 when it reverted to the original name until 1965. The present name has existed since then.
Chorleywood station was formerly served by steam-hauled Metropolitan line trains from Aylesbury to London, with a changeover to an electric locomotive at Rickmansworth. Steam trains were withdrawn in 1961 when electrification north of Rickmansworth to Amersham and Chesham was completed. From the early 1960s to 2012, Metropolitan line trains at Chorleywood were formed of London Underground A60 Stock (and the almost identical A62 Stock), but were replaced by London Underground S8 stock. Chiltern Railways (Aylesbury-Marylebone) trains are formed by Class 165 diesel multiple units.

Between October 2004 and December 2011 almost all southbound Metropolitan line trains from Chorleywood into London were fast trains to Baker Street, calling at , , , , and . Since December 2011 only a few morning peak hour Metropolitan line trains have been operated as fast trains, at other times the trains mostly call at all stations, adding over 10 minutes to journey times. The journey to central London takes around 35–50 minutes depending on the line and time of day. Northbound Metropolitan line trains call at all stations to or .

==Station layout==
The station has two platforms shared between the London Underground Metropolitan line and National Rail. Both platforms are accessible from street level. On Platform 2, there is one of the few surviving K8 telephone kiosks. Now used for the TfL internal system, the kiosk is Grade II listed

<text>The ruins of Cargill&#x27;s Castle stand on a promontory overlooking the Pacific Ocean in New Zealand&#x27;s southern city of Dunedin. It is one of about ten castles in New Zealand, the other one in Otago being nearby Larnach Castle. More a castle in name than in fact, this Italianate mansion was built for Edward Cargill, eighth child of city founder William Cargill, in the late 19th century, who called it &quot;The Cliffs&quot;. Designed by the young architect Francis Petre, and built in concrete by Harry Lyders at a cost of £14,000, it was completed in 1877. Several kilometres south of the castle is Tunnel Beach, so named because this quiet beach is only accessible through a steeply sloping tunnel cut into the high cliffs by the Cargill family. It is also very likely that Petre was the supervisor of the construction of the tunnel. While designing the house, Petre fell in love with Cargill&#x27;s daughter Margaret. After a difficult courtship (due to Petre&#x27;s staunch Catholicism and the Cargill family&#x27;s equally staunch Presbyterianism) the couple were eventually permitted to marry, the wedding taking place in the villa&#x27;s principal salon on 1 March 1881.

The building was gutted by a fire in 1892, Cargill restored the castle but was unable to meet the cost of replacing all the wooden furnishings, though he did add a ballroom. The castle had several owners after Cargill&#x27;s death in 1903, and was opened as a restaurant and cabaret in the 1930s by John Hutton, which became popular with visiting servicemen during World War II. Plans have been made on several occasions to restore the building to its former glory, but none have yet borne fruit. The castle now lies in ruins, a shell of what it once was. There is no public access to the site.

== Construction ==
The house is built from concrete, with concrete roofs on the loggia and the tower, and concrete floors. Several different types of reinforcement were used, which makes this an early example of the technology both in New Zealand and overseas.

<text>Classic Masters is a compilation album by Blind Melon. &quot;Classic Masters&quot; was released on January 29, 2002.

At the time of its release, &quot;Classic Masters&quot; drew some ire from the music press, most of whom quickly picked up on the differences between the &quot;Classic Masters&quot; versions and their complete album counterparts. For example, &quot;Mouthful of Cavities&quot; has the spoken &quot;Listen, man. I got the window open [Do] you hear the cats, man? Listen.&quot; intro by frontman Shannon Hoon excised.

<text>Harzgerode is a town in the district of Harz in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

==Geography==
Harzgerode lies in the lower eastern part of the Harz mountain range on the Selke River, south of Quedlinburg. It is connected to Gernrode and Quedlinburg via Alexisbad by a narrow gauge railway called the Selke Valley Railway (&quot;Selketalbahn&quot;).

The municipal area comprises the following 8 localities (&quot;Ortschaften&quot;), some of which consist of several divisions (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;):
*Dankerode 
*Güntersberge (incl. Bärenrode and Friedrichshöhe)
*Harzgerode (incl. Alexisbad, Mägdesprung and Silberhütte)
*Königerode
*Neudorf
*Schielo 
*Siptenfelde
*Straßberg

On 1 August 2009 the towns of Güntersberge and Harzgerode together with the municipalities of Dankerode, Königerode, Schielo, Siptenfelde and Straßberg became part of the new town of Harzgerode. On 1 September 2010 Neudorf was also incorporated.

==History==

The settlement in the medieval Duchy of Saxony was first mentioned in connection with the Benedictine abbey of &quot;Hagenenrod&quot; in the Selke valley founded in 975, to which King Otto III granted market, minting and customs rights in 993. The following year the place was mentioned as &quot;Hazacanroth&quot;, when the king granted the citizens of Quedlinburg market rights.

About 1000, the local Schwabengau counts of Ballenstedt, progenitors of the noble House of Ascania, served as &quot;Vogt&quot; protectors of the Hagenrode monastery dedicated to Saint John the Baptist. The abbey already lost its minting rights in 1035, when Emperor Conrad II had the mint relocated to Nienburg and though its estates were placed under protection by Pope Alexander III in 1179, the monks later left for the episcopal town of Naumburg. Devastated during the German Peasants&#x27; War in 1525, the monastery&#x27;s local possessions fell to the Ascanian Princes of Anhalt while the abbey&#x27;s buildings decayed.

Upon a 1252 division of the Principality of Anhalt, Harzgerode had become part of the Anhalt-Bernburg principality. The Harzgerode town privileges were renewed in 1338. Due to its protected location, the town did not suffer from many military conflicts, but it was repeatedly devastated by fire. Before 1503 there was a great fire; in 1635 (on Midsummer&#x27;s Day) every building in the town was razed with the exception of seven houses. On 30 June 1722 again 42 houses burned down; on 23 October 1817 52 houses were razed.

Temporarily given in pawn to the Counts of Stolberg, the rule was again assumed by the Anhalt princes in 1535. Harzgerode became the administrative centre of the double &quot;Amt&quot; of Harzgerode and Güntersberge, both vested with town privileges. In 1635 Prince Frederick made Harzgerode Castle, built in the mid 16th century, the residence of his Anhalt-Harzgerode principality.

For centuries, the surrounding Harz mountains were a significant mining area, mainly for fluorite and silver, such as in the preserved Glasebach Pit near the village of Straßberg. Likewise, the Lower Harz Pond and Ditch System is a historic example of mining water resource management, similar to the Upper Harz Water Regale. Harzgerode Castle, as well as Heinrichsberg Castle located near the town quarter of Mägdesprung, mark the historic significance of the region. Nearby are the ruins of Anhalt Castle which gave the entire state its name.
==Climate==

==Politics==
Seats in the municipal council (&quot;Stadtrat&quot;) as of 2014 local elections:
*Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU): 8
*Free Voters: 8
*Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 2
*The Left: 2

==Twin towns==

Harzgerode is twinned with:
* Leval, Nord, France, since 1999
* Bockenem, Germany (Güntersberge)
* Straßberg, Plauen, Germany (Straßberg)

==Notable people==
*Prince John George I of Anhalt-Dessau (1567–1618)
*Veronika Schmidt (born 1952), cross-country skier

<text>Top 40 Hits is the second full-length album by Anal Cunt, released in 1995 on CD and cassette by Earache Records.

The cover of this album is a parody of the compilation albums released in the 1970s by TV advertising company K-Tel.

The album was recorded in 1994 as part of the band&#x27;s attempt to move from playing noisecore to playing fast hardcore songs, although the album contains both styles. There are also numerous cover songs on the album including those of Rupert Holmes&#x27;s &quot;Escape (The Pina Colada Song)&quot;, The Guess Who&#x27;s &quot;American Woman&quot;, Elton John&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Still Standing&quot;, &quot;The A-Team&quot; theme song, and a cover of the Bee Gees song &quot;Stayin&#x27; Alive&quot;. Their &quot;Oi! version&quot; of this song was also released as a promotional single before the album was released. Additionally, the song &quot;Lenny&#x27;s in My Neighborhood&quot; parodies the Body Count song &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood&quot; both lyrically and musically. Seth Putnam said on his old website that he never got the sound he wanted with this album because it was recorded in an ADAT studio instead of an analog studio.

In 2004, Ameri defeated small businessman Tim Phillips and software executive Jason Meshell to become the Oregon Republican Party&#x27;s nominee for , in a challenge to then-three-term incumbent Democrat David Wu.

Ameri&#x27;s campaign gained a great deal of attention from political insiders in Washington, D.C. because of her fast-paced fundraising skills. She was dubbed one of the National Republican Congressional Committee&#x27;s &quot;Super Six&quot; candidates.

The contest received national attention when, late in the campaign, Wu admitted that he had been disciplined for attempted sexual assault of a female classmate while he was a student at Stanford in 1976. Ameri did not focus on the issue initially, but heavily pushed it in the closing days of her campaign. Wu won the election with 58 percent of the vote; Ameri received 38 percent, and Dean Wolf, the Constitution Party candidate, received 4 percent.

In June 2008, she traveled to Azerbaijan. During her trip, she signed an agreement on behalf of the United States with Azerbaijani Minister of Education Misir Mardanov to increase the number of Azerbaijani students studying in the United States. While in the capital city of Baku, Ameri also met with the President of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan, Mahmud Karimov and the leadership of the Academy&#x27;s Manuscripts Institute, promising American help in preserving the country&#x27;s ancient manuscripts. She concluded her trip with a meeting with Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev, where the two stressed the importance of American-Azerbaijani relations.

In July 2008, Ameri traveled to Indonesia to meet with educators, cultural experts, and alumni from U.S.-Indonesian exchange programs.

Ameri&#x27;s term as Assistant Secretary of State ended with the rest of the Bush Administration on January 20, 2009.

=== Red Cross and Red Crescent ===
On July 1, 2010, Ameri was appointed by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Values and Diplomacy. In this position, she was tasked with increasing Red Cross and Red Crescent influence with policymakers and governments to better understand the needs of the people the organization serves worldwide. She retired from this position on July 1, 2012.

=== StartItUp ===
After her tenure at the Red Cross, Ameri co-founded StartItUp, a mobile technology platform that provides a range of resources including assessment, training, mentorship and a social network to aspiring entrepreneurs. The company has partnered with several cities in Southern California to provide mentorship and other guidance to small business owners and entrepreneurs planning to start their own businesses, including the cities of Long Beach and Bakersfield.

<doc id="1090605" wikidata="Q2005372" url="?curid=1090605" title="Gregg Alexander">
<text>Gregg Alexander (born Gregory Aiuto; May 4, 1970) is an American singer, songwriter, and record producer. He served as lead vocalist and guitarist for the short-lived alternative rock band New Radicals, who are best known for the 1998 single &quot;You Get What You Give&quot;. 

After the release of their only album, &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot; (1998), the group disbanded and Alexander shifted focus onto production and songwriting work for other artists. Since then, he has been credited on the singles &quot;Life Is a Rollercoaster&quot; and &quot;Lovin&#x27; Each Day&quot; by Ronan Keating, &quot;Inner Smile&quot; by Texas, &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; and &quot;Mixed Up World&quot; by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, all of which were commercial successes in the early 2000s.

Alexander won a Grammy Award for his contributions to the 2003 single &quot;The Game of Love&quot; by Santana. He also co-wrote songs for the film &quot;Begin Again&quot;, including &quot;Lost Stars&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.

==Early life==
Born in Grosse Pointe, Michigan, Alexander was raised in a conservative Jehovah&#x27;s Witness household. He received his first guitar at age 12 and taught himself to play several instruments. He and his sister, Caroline, played piano and Gregg composed songs. 

==Career==
===Early career===

At age 14, he joined a band, The Circus, with his older brother, Stephen Aiuto, and classmates George Snow and John Mabarak. In 1984, they played their high school&#x27;s battle of the bands, a competition that also included John Lowery (later known as John 5). At age 16, Alexander signed his first recording contract with A&amp;M Records after playing his demo tapes for producer Rick Nowels. He released his debut album, &quot;Michigan Rain&quot;, in 1989 at age 19, to little notice. In 1992, he signed to Epic Records and released &quot;Intoxifornication&quot;, consisting largely of re-released songs from &quot;Michigan Rain&quot;, and was again ignored.

===New Radicals (1997–1999)===

====Breakthrough and break–up====
In 1997, Alexander formed New Radicals, a revolving-door band with no permanent members other than Alexander and his long-term collaborator Danielle Brisebois. In October 1998, they released the album &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;, which sold more than one million copies. The single &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; was released that autumn and was an international hit.

It was not long after New Radicals&#x27; success that Alexander became tired of the constant media attention and an exhausting touring schedule. In July 1999, &quot;Someday We&#x27;ll Know&quot; was announced as the band&#x27;s second single; several days later, Alexander announced he was disbanding New Radicals to focus on production work.

====2021 reunion====

On January 20, 2021, New Radicals reunited for a one-off performance of &quot;You Get What You Give&quot; on inauguration day for President Joe Biden. Used as a rally song at Biden campaign events, the song was a favorite of Joe&#x27;s son Beau Biden, who died in 2015. The song&#x27;s lyrics were recited by his sister Ashley during the eulogy at his funeral. 

The band had rejected offers to perform over the preceding 22 years, but wanted to honor this day and honor Beau, a military veteran. Prior to their performance on inauguration day, Alexander said: &quot;We pledged if Joe [Biden] won, we&#x27;d get together and play our little song both in memory and in honor of our new president&#x27;s patriot son Beau and also with the prayer of Joe being able to bring our country together again with compassion, honesty and justice for a change.&quot;

===Songwriting and production (1999–)===
====Success and Grammy Award (1999–2014)====
Since the summer of 1999, Alexander has written and produced hit songs for several artists, including Brisebois, Enrique Iglesias, Texas, Geri Halliwell, S Club 7, Melanie C, Rod Stewart, Hanson, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Mónica Naranjo, and Ronan Keating (he co-produced and co-wrote the album &quot;Destination&quot;). Alexander&#x27;s composition &quot;The Game of Love&quot;, recorded by Santana and Michelle Branch, earned him a Best Pop Collaboration prize at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Alexander as &quot;the catchiest, smartest professional mainstream pop songwriter of the early 2000s.&quot;

In 2003, he wrote four songs on Iglesias&#x27; album &quot;7&quot;, under the pseudonym Alex Ander. In 2004, a new Alexander track, &quot;A Love Like That,&quot; was released, uncredited, on the Internet. It was suspected to be a New Radicals outtake, as some of the lyrics appeared in the booklet accompanying &quot;Maybe You&#x27;ve Been Brainwashed Too&quot;. Also in 2004, Hanson released &quot;Lost Without Each Other,&quot; co-written by Alexander, on their album &quot;Underneath.&quot; &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Make Things Work&quot;, written by Alexander (and Rick Nowels), was released by &quot;Any Dream Will Do&quot; winner Lee Mead on his self-titled album in November 2007. In 2010, Boyzone released the single &quot;Love Is a Hurricane,&quot; written by Alexander and Brisebois.

====&quot;Lost Stars&quot; and Academy Award nomination (2014–2024)====

Alexander co-wrote and co-produced the music for the musical romance film &quot;Begin Again&quot;, along with his longtime collaborators Brisebois and Nowels, as well as Nick Lashley. Their song &quot;Lost Stars&quot; was nominated for an Best Original Song at the 2015 Academy Awards. On the soundtrack album, Alexander, Brisebois, Nowels and Lashley are credited under the name Cessyl Orchestra.

On November 4, 2014, Alexander appeared and performed publicly for the first time in 15 years at the Hollywood Music in Media Awards, singing &quot;Lost Stars.&quot; Since 2018, Alexander has been involved in writing sessions with Phil Thornalley and his 1970&#x27;s singer-songwriter inspired music project, &quot;Astral Drive&quot;. Two songs co-written by Alexander have been released: &quot;Take Back the World&quot; and &quot;This Is the Place&quot;. Alexander assisted with production of The Struts&#x27; album &quot;Everybody Wants&quot; and co-wrote two songs: &quot;The Ol&#x27; Switcheroo&quot; and &quot;Put Your Money on Me.&quot; He also co-wrote and provided backup vocals for Spencer Ludwig&#x27;s 2016 single, &quot;Right Into U&quot;; and co-wrote (with Lashley and Nowels) the Kaiser Chiefs&#x27; 2019 song &quot;The Only Ones&quot;.

====&quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot; (2024–)====

In January 2024, Sophie Ellis-Bextor&#x27;s &quot;Murder on the Dancefloor&quot;, co-written by Alexander, became a viral hit due to its appearance in the film &quot;Saltburn&quot;. The resurgence of the song also carried over to social network TikTok, which expanded the song&#x27;s popularity. It rocketed back up to #2 on the UK Singles chart, and reached #51 on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. This became the biggest hit for Alexander&#x27;s career since &quot;The Game of Love&quot; in 2003.

<text>Sir Roderick Ian Eddington (born 2 January 1950) is an Australian businessman.

He was first appointed to the board of News Corporation in 1999 and still serves on the News Corp board, as well as the board of another of Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s companies, 21st Century Fox, as well as the Herald and Weekly Times in Victoria.

, Eddington is chair of Lion and serves on the board of its Japanese parent company, Kirin. He is also chair of JP Morgan&#x27;s Asia-Pacific Advisory Council, chair of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia, and a member of the APEC Business Advisory Council.

He has served in other senior positions including as CEO of British Airways.

==Education and career==

Coming from a country area where there were no high schools, Eddington went to Perth in 1963 to attend Christ Church Grammar School. He studied engineering at the University of Western Australia and graduated with first class honours in 1972. He continued his studies at UWA and completed the degree of Master of Engineering. In 1974, Eddington was the Rhodes Scholar from Western Australia. He completed his DPhil in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford and played eight first-class cricket matches for Oxford University Cricket Club in 1975 and 1976. He was President of Vincent&#x27;s Club in 1977.

Eddington joined the Swire Group in 1979, working for its subsidiary Cathay Pacific, before being appointed Managing Director in 1992. Continuing his association with the airline industry; News Limited, subsidiary of News Corporation, appointed Eddington Chairman of Ansett Australia in January 1997, four years before the airline failed. News Corp had taken control of the airline with TNT in 1979. Eddington was appointed Deputy Chairman of News Limited in September 1998. He was further promoted to the News Corporation board in September 1999.

===British Airways CEO===
Eddington replaced former British Airways CEO Bob Ayling on 2 May 2000. He reversed many of the policies of his predecessor in early 2001, such as the unpopular ethnic-art tailfins. He steered the company in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.

In 2003, he retired the British Airways Concorde, a move viewed as controversial. Eddington stepped down as chief executive officer of British Airways on 30 September 2005, after more than five years in the position. He then returned to Australia to take up a position as the head of the Victorian Major Events Association, succeeding Steve Vizard. Eddington was replaced by Willie Walsh in October 2005 after he had followed a six-month shadow position.

===Board memberships===
In February 2006, Eddington served as a non-executive board member of JPMorgan representing Australia and New Zealand.

As of 2018, he still served on the boards of News Corp and 21st Century Fox. In April 2019 he joined the board of News Corp&#x27;s Herald and Weekly Times in Victoria.

Eddington was appointed to the board of Lion in March 2011, and appointed chair in March 2012. He joined the parent company&#x27;s board (Kirin) in March 2020, and holds these positions .

 Eddington was:
*chair of JP Morgan&#x27;s Asia-Pacific Advisory Council;
*chair of Infrastructure Partnerships Australia;
*a member of the APEC Business Advisory Council; and
*President of the Australia Japan Business Cooperation Committee.

==Government reports==

===Transport Study in Britain===

On 1 December 2006, Eddington published a UK government-sponsored report into the future of Britain&#x27;s transport infrastructure. Known as the Eddington Transport Study, it spelled out a plan to improve road and rail networks, as a &quot;crucial enabler of sustained productivity and competitiveness&quot;. In its conclusions, the report highlighted Britain&#x27;s transport networks that provide the right connections, in the right places, to support the journeys that matter to economic performance. But roads in particular were in serious danger of becoming so congested, the economy would suffer.

At the launch of the report Eddington told journalists and transport industry representatives introducing road pricing to encourage drivers to drive less was an &quot;economic no-brainer&quot;. There was, he said &quot;no attractive alternative&quot;. It would cut congestion by half by 2025, and bring benefits to the British economy totalling £28b.

The report also called for a programme of improvements to existing road and rail networks, the expansion of key airports, and adoption of the general principle that travellers should pay for the external costs of the pollution and congestion their journeys cause.

===Transport Study in Victoria, Australia===

Eddington has since delivered a report to the Victorian Government of Australia, the East West Link Needs Assessment report, which was met with mixed reactions. Economic commentators criticised the cost-benefit ratios of Eddington&#x27;s proposals, which on Eddington&#x27;s own analysis were marginal at best.

==Honours==
Eddington is a Council member of the Royal Institution of Australia.

Eddington received a British knighthood in 2005 for services to the aviation industry.

In 2012 he was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) &quot;for distinguished service to business and commerce through roles with a range of national and international economic, trade, infrastructure development and transport organisations&quot;, and was also elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering.

In 2015 he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun by the Japanese Government for his &quot;contribution to strengthening the economic relations between Australia and Japan&quot;.

<doc id="1090609" wikidata="Q913584" url="?curid=1090609" title="Genetic genealogy">
<text>Genetic genealogy is the use of genealogical DNA tests, i.e., DNA profiling and DNA testing, in combination with traditional genealogical methods, to infer genetic relationships between individuals. This application of genetics came to be used by family historians in the 21st century, as DNA tests became affordable. The tests have been promoted by amateur groups, such as surname study groups or regional genealogical groups, as well as research projects such as the Genographic Project.

 about 30 million people had been tested. As the field developed, the aims of practitioners broadened, with many seeking knowledge of their ancestry beyond the recent centuries, for which traditional pedigrees can be constructed.
==History==

The investigation of surnames in genetics can be said to go back to George Darwin, a son of Charles Darwin and Charles&#x27; first cousin Emma Darwin. In 1875, George Darwin used surnames to estimate the frequency of first-cousin marriages and calculated the expected incidence of marriage between people of the same surname (isonymy). He arrived at a figure of 1.5% for cousin-marriage in the population of London, higher (3%-3.5%) among the upper classes and lower (2.25%) among the general rural population.

===Surname studies===
A famous study in 1998 examined the lineage of descendants of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s paternal line and male lineage descendants of the freed slave Sally Hemings.

Bryan Sykes, a molecular biologist at Oxford University, tested the new methodology in general surname research. His study of the Sykes surname, published in 2000, obtained results by looking at four STR markers on the male chromosome. It pointed the way to genetics becoming a valuable assistant in the service of genealogy and history.

===Direct-to-consumer DNA testing===

In 2000, Family Tree DNA was the first company to provide direct-to-consumer genetic testing for genealogy research. It initially offered eleven-marker Y-chromosome STR tests and HVR1 mitochondrial DNA tests but not multi-generational genealogy tests. In 2001, GeneTree was acquired by Sorenson Molecular Genealogy Foundation (SMGF), which provided free Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) tests. GeneTree later returned to genetic testing in conjunction with its Sorenson parent company until it was acquired by Ancestry.com in 2012.

In 2007, 23andMe was the first company to offer saliva-based direct-to-consumer testing, and the first to use autosomal DNA for ancestry testing. An autosome is one of the 22 chromosomes other than the X or Y chromosomes. They are transmitted from all ancestors in recent generations and so can be used to match with other testers who may be related. Companies were later also able to use this data to estimate how much of each ethnicity a customer has. FamilyTreeDNA entered this market in 2010, followed by AncestryDNA in 2012, and the number of tests grew rapidly. By 2018 autosomal testing had become the predominant type of test, and for many companies the only test they offered.

MyHeritage launched its testing service in 2016, allowing users to use cheek swabs to collect samples, and introduced new analysis tools in 2019: autoclusters (grouping matches visually into clusters) and family tree theories (suggesting conceivable relations between DNA matches by combining several MyHeritage trees and the Geni global family tree). Living DNA, founded in 2015, uses SNP chips to provide reports on autosomal ancestry, Y, and mtDNA ancestry.

By 2019, the combined total of customers at the four largest companies was 26 million. By August 2019, it was reported that about 30 million people had had their DNA tested for genealogical purposes.

GEDmatch said in 2018 that about half of their one million profiles were American. Due to the limited geographical distribution of DNA testees, databases and results limit knowledge of variation present in other racial groups. However, this can only be remedied by testing more individuals, making geneticists aware of the genetic variation present in currently underrepresented testees.

===Genetic genealogy revolution===
The publication of &quot;The Seven Daughters of Eve&quot; by Sykes in 2001, which described the seven major haplogroups of European ancestors, helped push personal ancestry testing through DNA tests into wide public notice. With the growing availability and affordability of genealogical DNA testing, genetic genealogy as a field grew rapidly. By 2003, the field of DNA testing of surnames was declared officially to have &quot;arrived&quot; in an article by Jobling and Tyler-Smith in &quot;Nature Reviews Genetics&quot;. The number of firms offering tests, and the number of consumers ordering them, rose dramatically. In 2018, a paper in &quot;Science Magazine&quot; estimated that a DNA genealogy search on anybody of European descent would result in a third cousin or closer match 60% of the time.

===Genographic Project===
The original Genographic Project was a five-year research study launched in 2005 by the National Geographic Society and IBM, in partnership with the University of Arizona and Family Tree DNA. Its goals were primarily anthropological. The project announced that by April 2010 it had sold more than 350,000 of its public participation testing kits, which test the general public for either twelve STR markers on the Y chromosome or mutations on the HVR1 region of the mtDNA.

The phase of the project in 2016 was Geno 2.0 Next Generation. As of 2018, almost one-million participants in over 140 countries had joined the project.

===Typical customers and interest groups===

Genetic genealogy has enabled groups of people to trace their ancestry even though they are not able to use conventional genealogical techniques. This may be because they do not know one or both of their birth parents or because conventional genealogical records have been lost, destroyed or never existed. These groups include adoptees, foundlings, Holocaust survivors, GI babies, child migrants, descendants of children from orphan trains and people with slave ancestry.

The earliest test takers were customers most often those who started with a Y-chromosome test to determine their father&#x27;s paternal ancestry. These men often took part in surname projects. The first phase of the Genographic Project brought new participants into genetic genealogy. Those who tested were as likely to be interested in direct maternal heritage as their paternal. The number of those taking mtDNA tests increased. The introduction of autosomal SNP tests based on microarray chip technology changed the demographics. Women were as likely as men to test themselves.

===Citizen science and ISOGG===

Members of the genetic genealogy community have been credited with making useful contributions to knowledge in the field, an example of citizen science.

One of the earliest interest groups to emerge was the International Society of Genetic Genealogy (ISOGG). Their stated goal is to promote DNA testing for genealogy. Members advocate the use of genetics in genealogical research and the group facilitates networking among genetic genealogists. Since 2006 ISOGG has maintained the regularly updated ISOGG Y-chromosome phylogenetic tree. ISOGG aims to keep the tree as up-to-date as possible, incorporating new SNPs. However, the tree has been described by academics as not completely academically verified, phylogenetic trees of Y chromosome haplogroups.

==Uses==
===Direct maternal lineages===

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing involves sequencing at least part of the mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial DNA is transmitted from mother to child, and so can reveal information about the unbroken maternal line. When two individuals have matching or near matching mitochondrial DNA, it can be inferred that they share a common maternal-line ancestor at some point in the &quot;recent&quot; past. Care should be taken to avoid overstating the recency of a relationship however, as a mutation in the mitochondrial genome will only occur every 1000 to 3000 years on average. For this reason, it is usually impossible to distinguish between two individuals related within the last one or two millennia on the basis of mtDNA alone.

===Direct paternal lineages===

Y-Chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) testing involves short tandem repeat (STR) and, sometimes, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) testing of the Y-Chromosome, which is present only in males and only reveals information on the unbroken paternal line. As with the mitochondria, close matches with individuals indicate a recent common ancestor. However, because a permanent SNP mutation occurs much more frequently on the Y chromosome as compared to mitochondrial DNA, male lineages are much more temporally resolved, with the average lineage producing a new permanent, unique mutation every 83 years. Because surnames in many cultures are transmitted down the paternal line, this testing is often used by surname DNA projects.

While early studies using STRs made bold claims that large numbers of men descend from prominent historical individuals (e.g. Niall of the Nine Hostages and Genghis Khan), more recent SNP studies have shown many of these to be invalid. In particular, STR mutations are now known to be largely unreliable in proving kinship, as these mutations can appear in multiple unrelated lineages by chance. SNP testing is necessary to prove a true relationship, as these mutations are considered so rare that they could only have arisen in one individual in history. In the few cases where the same SNP mutation occurs in different lineages, the accompanying SNPs ensure its recognition as a &quot;de novo&quot; mutation. Even so, studies based ostensibly on SNP mutations can still be misleading, as in the case of Fehér (2024), which presented few if any results from individuals with verified patrilines, and associated kin-groups with various SNP mutations that predate their formation by hundreds or thousands of years.

To prove descent from a common ancestor in the male line, a Y-DNA clade generally requires triangulation back to a most recent common ancestor (MRCA), who is generally referred to by the name of the mutation (e.g. L21, U106, etc.) as a shorthand. A SNP mutation unique to a family or kin group is referred to as a &quot;defining mutation&quot;, the testing of which can exclude men not related through the male line within one or two centuries at the most. This has been exploited in recent times to identify the defining mutations of noble and royal lineages, such as the Stewarts of Scotland and the Uí Briúin dynasty of Ireland.

===Pedigree family trees===
Pedigree family trees have traditionally been prepared from recollections of individuals about their parents and grandparents. These family trees may be extended if recollections of earlier generations were preserved through oral tradition or written documents. Some genealogists regard oral tradition as myths unless confirmed with written documentation like birth certificates, marriage certificates, census reports, headstones, or notes in family bibles. Few written records are kept by illiterate populations, and many documents have been destroyed by warfare or natural disasters. DNA comparison may offer an alternative means of confirming family relationships of biological parents, but may be confused by adoption or when a mother conceals the identity of the father of her child.

While mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA matching offer the most definitive confirmation of ancestral relationships, the information from a tested individual is relevant to a decreasing fraction of their ancestors from earlier generations. Potential ambiguity must be considered when seeking confirmation from comparison of autosomal DNA. The first source of ambiguity arises from the underlying similarity of every individual&#x27;s DNA sequence. Many short gene segments will be identical by coincidental recombination (Identical by State: IBS) rather than inheritance from a single ancestor (Identical by Descent: IBD). Segments of greater length offer increased confidence of a shared ancestor. A second source of ambiguity results from the random distribution of genes to each child of a parent. Only identical twins inherit exactly the same gene segments. Although a child inherits exactly half of their DNA from each parent, the percentage inherited from any given ancestor in an earlier generation (with the exception of X chromosome DNA) varies within a normal distribution around a median value of 100% divided by the number of ancestors in that generation. An individual comparing autosomal DNA with ancestors of successively earlier generations will encounter an increasing number of ancestors from whom they inherited no DNA segments of significant length. Since individuals inherit only a small portion of their DNA from each of their great-grandparents, cousins descended from the same ancestor may not inherit the same DNA segments from that ancestor. All descendants of the same parent or grandparent, and nearly all descendants of the same great-grandparent, will share gene segments of significant length; but approximately 10% of 3rd cousins, 55% of 4th cousins, 85% of 5th cousins, and more than 95% of more distant cousins will share no gene segments of significant length. Failure to share a gene segment of significant length does not disprove the shared ancestry of a distant cousin.

The best autosomal DNA method for confirming ancestry is to compare DNA with known relatives. A more complicated task is using a DNA database to identify previously unknown individuals who share DNA with the individual of interest; and then attempting to find shared ancestors with those individuals. The first problem with the latter procedure involves the relatively poor family history knowledge of most database populations. A significant percentage of individuals in many DNA databases have done DNA testing because they are uncertain of their parentage, and many who confidently identify their parents are unable or unwilling to share information about earlier generations. It may be easier to identify a shared ancestor in the fortunate situation of shared DNA between two individuals with comprehensive family trees, but finding multiple shared ancestors raises the question of from which of those ancestors was the shared segment inherited. Resolving that ambiguity typically requires finding a third individual sharing both the ancestor and the gene segment of interest.

===Ancestral origins===

A common component of many autosomal tests is a prediction of biogeographical origin, often called ethnicity. A company offering the test uses computer algorithms and calculations to make a prediction of what percentage of an individual&#x27;s DNA comes from particular ancestral groups. A typical number of populations is at least 20. Despite this aspect of the tests being heavily promoted and advertised, many genetic genealogists have warned consumers that the results may be inaccurate, and at best are only approximate.

Modern DNA sequencing has identified various ancestral components in contemporary populations. A number of these genetic elements have West Eurasian origins. They include the following ancestral components, with their geographical hubs and main associated populations:
===Human migration===
Genealogical DNA testing methods have been used on a longer time scale to trace human migratory patterns. For example, they determined when the first humans came to North America and what path they followed.

For several years, researchers and laboratories from around the world sampled indigenous populations from around the globe in an effort to map historical human migration patterns. The National Geographic Society&#x27;s Genographic Project aims to map historical human migration patterns by collecting and analyzing DNA samples from over 100,000 people across five continents. The DNA Clans Genetic Ancestry Analysis measures a person&#x27;s precise genetic connections to indigenous ethnic groups from around the world.

===Law enforcement===

Law enforcement may use genetic genealogy to track down perpetrators of violent crimes such as murder or sexual assault and they may also use it to identify deceased individuals. Initially genetic genealogy sites GEDmatch and Family Tree DNA allowed their databases to be used by law enforcement and DNA technology companies to do DNA testing for violent criminal cases and genetic genealogy research at the request of law enforcement. This investigative, or forensic, genetic genealogy technique became popular after the arrest of the alleged Golden State Killer in 2018, but has received significant backlash from privacy experts. However, in May 2019 GEDmatch made their privacy rules more restrictive, thereby reducing the incentive for law enforcement agencies to use their site. Other sites such as Ancestry.com, 23andMe and MyHeritage have data policies that say that they would not allow their customer data to be used for crime solving without a warrant from law enforcement as they believed it violated users&#x27; privacy.

<doc id="1090611" wikidata="Q1672843" url="?curid=1090611" title="Irish grid reference system">
<text>The Irish grid reference system is a system of geographic grid references used for paper mapping in Ireland (both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland). Any location in Ireland can be described in terms of its distance from the origin (0, 0), which lies off the southwest coast. The Irish grid partially overlaps the British grid, and uses a similar co-ordinate system but with a meridian more suited to its westerly location.

==Usage==
In general, neither Ireland nor Great Britain uses latitude or longitude in describing internal geographic locations. Instead grid reference systems are used for mapping.

The national grid referencing system was devised by the Ordnance Survey, and is heavily used in their survey data, and in maps (whether published by the Ordnance Survey of Ireland, the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland or commercial map producers) based on those surveys. Additionally grid references are commonly quoted in other publications and data sources, such as guide books or government planning documents.

==2001 recasting: the ITM grid==

In 2001, the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and the Ordnance Survey of Northern Ireland jointly implemented a new coordinate system for Ireland called Irish Transverse Mercator, or ITM, a location-specific optimisation of UTM, which runs in parallel with the existing Irish grid system. In both systems, the true origin is at 53° 30&#x27; N, 8° W — a point in Lough Ree, close to the western (Co. Roscommon) shore, whose grid reference is . The ITM system was specified so as to provide precise alignment with modern high-precision global positioning receivers.

==Grid letters==

The area of Ireland is divided into 25 squares, measuring , each identified by a single letter. The squares are numbered A to Z with I being omitted. Seven of the squares do not actually cover any land in Ireland: A, E, K, P, U, Y and Z.

==Eastings and northings==
Within each square, eastings and northings from the origin (south west corner) of the square are given numerically. For example, G0305 means &#x27;square G, east, north&#x27;. A location can be indicated to varying resolutions numerically, usually from two digits in each coordinate (for a square) through to five (for a ) square; the most common usage is the &quot;six figure grid reference&quot;, employing three digits in each coordinate to determine a square.

Coordinates may also be given relative to the origin of the entire grid (in the format easting, northing). For example, the location of the Spire of Dublin on O&#x27;Connell Street may be given as 315904, 234671 as well as O1590434671. Coordinates in this format must never be truncated, because, for example, 31590, 23467 is also a valid location.

<text>The Liberty ship SS &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; was the last allied ship sunk by the Luftwaffe in World War II. Twenty two crew members and seven members of the United States Navy Armed Guard lost their lives in this action. The vessel was named after Henry Bacon, the American architect who designed and built many monuments and settings for public sculpture, including the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.
==World War II==
The &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; was one of the thirty-eight merchant ships in convoy RA 64, which departed Kola Inlet, Murmansk, North Russia bound for Loch Ewe, Gourock, Scotland on Friday, 17 February 1945. The crew complement under Captain Alfred Carini was forty-one merchant seamen and twenty-six US Navy Armed Guard. The &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; was in ballast and carrying nineteen Norwegian civilian refugees, including women and children, as passengers.

Before the convoy set sail, news had been received of a German attack on Norwegian patriots living on the island of Sørøya, in the approaches to the former German naval anchorage at Altafjord. The British Royal Navy had sent four destroyers to the scene and had rescued 500 men, women and children. These refugees were distributed among the ships of the convoy for passage to England.

On the afternoon of the Saturday, 18 February, the weather deteriorated to force 8 on the Beaufort scale, and the escort carriers were unable to operate aircraft. That night the storm intensified with winds gusting up to sixty knots (110 km/h) with a heavy sea and swell. The convoy split up and began to disperse. The storm continued through Sunday, 19 February.

On 20 February, the storm abated and the escort vessels started to round up the scattered ships. At 4 am the convoy had been detected by aircraft, and by 9 am twenty-nine of the ships were back on station with four still straggling.

Then, on 22 February, the convoy ran into one of the worst storms ever recorded in the Barents Sea. Once again the convoy began to split up and was blown apart. The weather deteriorated to Beaufort scale force 12 with winds at 70 to 90 knots and temperatures 40 below zero. During this storm, one of the main springs on the &quot;Henry Bacon&quot;″s steering gear was broken, and the retaining pin was sheared. This damage caused the &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; to drop out of the convoy to effect repairs.

==Fate==
Around 1500 GCT on 23 February 1945, the &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; was some 50 to 60 nautical miles astern of the main convoy when she was attacked by twenty-three Junkers Ju 88 and Ju 188&#x27;s torpedo bombers of Luftwaffe Group KG26, out of Bardufoss, Norway, some 250 miles (400 km) away. The Germans were on their way to attack the main convoy, and thought they could finish the lone straggler easily. The &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; was armed with eight 20 mm anti-aircraft guns, with a 5-inch (127 mm) gun aft and a 3 in (76 mm) gun forward. The ship&#x27;s Naval Armed Guard gunners fought the attacking planes for over an hour, shot down five planes, damaged at least four others and managed to defend against several torpedoes by causing their detonation before they reached the ship.

At 1520 GCT, one torpedo struck the starboard side of the No.5 hold, and detonated the aft ammunition magazine. A large hole was torn in the hull. The rudder, propeller and steering engine were destroyed. The ship settled by the stern and sank within an hour. This action helped save the main convoy, as most of the German planes were forced to return to base owing to battle damage, low fuel, and low ammunition.

The &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; was abandoned at 1600 GCT at 67.38N 05.00E. Lifeboats No. 1 and No. 2 were launched safely. The No. 3 boat capsized while being lowered, and because the davits to the No. 4 boat had been damaged in the storm, this boat was also lost. Three of the four life rafts had been released prematurely and had drifted away. The two surviving lifeboats were filled to capacity with all of the Norwegian passengers and some members of the crew.

This left a number of crew members stranded aboard the &quot;Henry Bacon&quot;. When this situation became known to Chief Engineer Donald Haviland, he insisted that he would give his place in the lifeboat to a younger crew member and died with the ship. That crew member&#x27;s name was Robert Tatosky. For his sacrifice, Chief Engineer Haviland was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the highest award for the men of the Merchant Marine.

The Bosun, Holcomb Lammon, collected dunnage from the deck and lashed it into a makeshift life-raft. Six Armed Guard and five merchant crew owe their lives to this raft. Lammon also died with the ship, and he was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.

==Aftermath==
The survivors were rescued by crew members from three British destroyers, , and HMS &quot;Zelast&quot;. By this time the men in the water were so cold they were unable to help themselves, so the British sailors had to jump into the freezing sea with ropes tied around their waists to help them. When it was over, all of the Norwegian civilians had survived, nine Naval Armed Guard gunners, and two Navy signalmen were lost at sea. Captain Carini and fifteen fellow Merchant Marine crewmen were also lost. In 1946, Captain Carini was posthumously awarded the &quot;Krigskorset med Sverd&quot; or Norwegian War Cross with Sword. This is Norway&#x27;s highest military award for gallantry and he is one of only two Americans, and 126 foreigners to have received this award.

Some of the surviving crew members from the &quot;Henry Bacon&quot; were taken first to Iceland and then to Scapa Flow. There, King Haakon VII of Norway presented them with the Norwegian War Medal, but not before they were interrogated as suspected German spies who had been planted in the water later, since no one believed that anybody could have survived two hours in the freezing waters. After being found innocent, the survivors returned to the United States on the , where they arrived at Newport News, Virginia, on 20 March 1945.

The Royal Norwegian Embassy in Washington, DC now sponsors the annual &quot;SS Henry Bacon Memorial Lecture&quot; on 23 February 2003, the anniversary of the ship&#x27;s sinking.

<text>The Ayn Rand Institute: The Center for the Advancement of Objectivism, commonly known as the Ayn Rand Institute (ARI), is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit think tank in Santa Ana, California, that promotes Objectivism, the philosophy developed by Ayn Rand. The organization was established in 1985, three years after Rand&#x27;s death, by businessman Ed Snider and Leonard Peikoff, Rand&#x27;s legal heir.

Ideas promoted by the Ayn Rand Institute include atheism, capitalism, and individual rights. The ARI has supported the American Tea Party movement and initially supported the United States&#x27; wars against Afghanistan and Iraq but then criticized the execution of these wars. A critic of government spending, the organization took a federal loan of between $350,000 and $1 million in 2020 under the Paycheck Protection Program. 

The institute&#x27;s stated goal is to &quot;create a culture whose guiding principles are reason, rational self-interest, individualism and laissez-faire capitalism&quot;. ARI has several educational and outreach programs, which include providing intellectuals for public appearances, supporting Objectivist campus clubs, supplying Rand&#x27;s writings to schools and professors, assisting overseas Objectivist institutions, organizing annual conferences, and running the Objectivist Academic Center.

== History ==
Peikoff, her legal heir, was convinced to found the Ayn Rand Institute after businessman Ed Snider organized a meeting of possible financial supporters in New York in the fall of 1983. Peikoff then agreed to be the first chairman of the organization&#x27;s board of directors.

In 1983, a group of Objectivists, including George Reisman, organized the Jefferson School of Philosophy, Economics and Politics. The Jefferson School held a two-week-long conference at the University of California, San Diego later that year, a conference which continued to occur every two years and is the predecessor of ARI&#x27;s current annual Objectivist Conference.

ARI began operations on February 1, 1985, three years after Rand&#x27;s death, in Marina del Rey, California. The first board of directors included Snider and psychologist Edith Packer. Snider was also one of the founding donors for the organization along with educational entrepreneur Carl Barney. Its first executive director was Michael Berliner, who was previously the chairman of the Department of Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education at California State University, Northridge. ARI also established a board of governors, which initially included Harry Binswanger, Robert Hessen, Edwin Locke, Arthur Mode, George Reisman, Jay Snider, and Mary Ann Sures, with Peter Schwartz as its chairman. M. Northrup Buechner and George Walsh joined the board of advisors shortly thereafter.

ARI&#x27;s first two projects were aimed at students. One was developing a network of college clubs to study Objectivism. The other was a college scholarship contest for high-school students based on writing an essay about Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Later, additional essay contests were added based on &quot;Anthem&quot;, &quot;We the Living&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;. In 1988, ARI began publishing &quot;Impact&quot;, a newsletter for contributors.

In 1989, a philosophical dispute resulted in ARI ending its association with philosopher David Kelley. Some members of the board of advisors agreed with Kelley and also left, including George Walsh. Kelley subsequently founded his own competing institute now known as The Atlas Society, which remains critical of ARI&#x27;s stance on strict loyalty to Rand&#x27;s principles.

In 1994, ARI launched the Objectivist Graduate Center, which offered both distance-learning and in-person courses.

In January 2000, Berliner retired as executive director, replaced by Yaron Brook, then an assistant professor of finance at Santa Clara University. Onkar Ghate began working for ARI later that year and ARI launched the Objectivist Academic Center.

In 2002, ARI moved from Marina del Rey to larger offices in Irvine, California. In 2003, ARI launched the Anthem Fellowship for the Study of Objectivism, a fellowship that financially supports universities who have Objectivist professors.

Charity Navigator, which rates charitable and educational organizations to inform potential donors, gives ARI two out of four stars in 2020. , ARI&#x27;s board of directors consists of Brook; Tsfany; Harry Binswanger, philosopher and long-time associate of Rand; Tara Smith, professor of philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin; and John Allison, board member and former CEO of the Cato Institute and former CEO of BB&amp;T.; Larry Salzman of the Pacific Legal Foundation; Tim Blum, a Chicago real-estate developer; Robert Mayhew, professor of philosophy at Seton Hall University; Jim Brown, CFA; Onkar Ghate, Chief Philosophy Officer of the institute.

Peikoff retains a cooperative and influential relationship with ARI. In 2006, he remarked that he approved of the work ARI has done and in November 2010 that the executive director &quot;has done a splendid job&quot;. Peikoff was a featured speaker at the 2007 and 2010 Objectivist Conferences. In August 2010, he demanded a change to ARI&#x27;s board of directors, resulting in the resignation of John McCaskey.

A central goal for ARI throughout the 2010s has been to spread Objectivism globally. ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Israel in 2012, the Ayn Rand Institute Europe in 2015 and the Ayn Rand Center Japan in 2017. Each of these organizations are separate legal entities from the United States-based ARI, but they are all affiliated with ARI.

In January 2017, ARI announced Jim Brown as its CEO, succeeding Yaron Brook as its operational executive. In June 2018, Tal Tsfany, co-founder of the Ayn Rand Center Israel, took over as the president and CEO of ARI.

In 2020, ARI received a Paycheck Protection Program loan of between $350K and $1 million, which Binswanger and Ghate described as &quot;partial restitution for government-inflicted losses&quot;. The decision was criticized due to the incongruity of some organizations previously opposed to federal spending receiving the funds during the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic impact on small businesses.

== Ideas promoted ==
ARI promotes Objectivism, the philosophy developed by Ayn Rand. ARI sponsors writers and speakers who apply Objectivism to contemporary issues, including philosophy, politics and art.

Since Objectivism advocates atheism, ARI promotes the separation of church and state and its writers argue that the religious right poses a threat to individual rights. They have argued against displaying religious symbols such as the Ten Commandments in government facilities and against faith-based initiatives. ARI intellectuals argue that religion is incompatible with American ideals and opposes the teaching of &quot;intelligent design&quot; in public schools.

ARI is strongly supportive of free speech and opposes all forms of censorship, including laws that ban obscenity and hate speech. In response to the Muhammad cartoons controversy, ARI started a Free Speech Campaign in 2006. Steve Simpson, formerly director of legal studies at ARI, has argued that campaign finance is a free speech issue and that laws that limit it are a violation of the First Amendment. Accordingly, Simpson and ARI strongly supports &quot;Citizens United&quot;.

ARI holds that the motivation for Islamic terrorism comes from their religiosity, not poverty or a reaction to Western policies. They have urged that the United States use overwhelming, retaliatory force to &quot;end states who sponsor terrorism&quot;, using whatever means are necessary to end the threat. In his article &quot;End States Who Sponsor Terrorism&quot;, which was published as a full page ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Peikoff wrote: &quot;The choice today is mass death in the United States or mass death in the terrorist nations. Our Commander-In-Chief must decide whether it is his duty to save Americans or the governments who conspire to kill them.&quot; Although some at ARI initially supported the invasion of Iraq, it has criticized how the Iraq War was handled. Since October 2, 2001, ARI has held that Iran should be the primary target in the war against &quot;Islamic totalitarianism&quot;.

ARI is generally supportive of Israel. Of Zionism, Yaron Brook writes: &quot;Zionism fused a valid concern – self-preservation amid a storm of hostility – with a toxic premise – ethnically based collectivism and religion.&quot; ARI is highly critical of environmentalism and animal rights, arguing that they are destructive to human well-being. ARI is also highly critical of diversity and affirmative action programs as well as multiculturalism, arguing that they are based on racist premises that ignore the commonality of a shared humanity. ARI supports women&#x27;s right to choose abortion, voluntary euthanasia and assisted suicide.

ARI denounces neoconservatism in general. For example, C. Bradley Thompson wrote an article entitled &quot;The Decline and Fall of American Conservatism&quot;, which was later turned with Yaron Brook into a book called &quot;Neoconservatism: An Obituary for an Idea&quot;.

&quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot; described ARI as a right-wing organization.

== Programs and activism ==
ARI runs a variety of programs, many of which are aimed at students. It sends free books to schools, sponsors student essay contests and campus clubs and offers financial assistance to students applying to graduate school. It also has an online bookstore, offers internships for current and recently graduated college students and provides speakers for public lectures and media appearances.

In October 2012, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Israel (ARCI) to promote Objectivism in Israel and the Middle East. Its current director is Boaz Arad. In 2016, ARCI launched the Atlas Award for the Best Israeli Start-up, presented annually at the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Judges for the award include Yaron Brook and Shlomo Kalish. Moovit was the first recipient of the award in 2016 and Zebra Medical Vision won the award in 2017.

In April 2015, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Institute Europe to promote Objectivism in Europe. The current chairman of ARI Europe is Lars Seir Christensen, CEO and co-founder of Saxo Bank. In February 2017, ARI helped establish the Ayn Rand Center Japan. ARI has also helped guide the independent Spain-based Objetivismo Internacional, which seeks to spread Objectivism in the Spanish-speaking world.

===The Atlas Award===

The stated goal of the Ayn Rand Institute Atlas Award is to encourage entrepreneurship. The institute states it is awarded to honour the most innovative entrepreneur who through wealth building and life enhancing enterprise ambition uses their technological developments to make the &quot;world a better place&quot; which reflects the essence of connecting these values &quot;to one of the best parts of the Israeli economy&quot;. CEO of Moovit Nir Erez, the recipient of the award in 2016, sought to distance himself from controversial politics surrounding the Institute and award, stating &quot;We are purely trying to focus on transportation and moving, not on political issues. On the contrary, we would like to be as apolitical as possible.&quot;

Recipients include:
* 2016 Moovit

<text>Schielo is a village and a former municipality in the district of Harz, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Since 1 August 2009, it is part of the town of Harzgerode. Basket weaving was common until in the early 20th century logging took over. Today agriculture, a number of small businesses, a caring home specialising in residential and nursing dementia care, as well as tourism related activities dominate the area.
== Location ==
Schielo lies to the east of Harzgerode, to the north of Königerode and the B242 Cross-Harz-Highway and to the west of Molmerswende.

== Hiking ==
While Schielo is outside the area of the Harzer Wandernadel hiking system, it is only three kilometers from the E11 european long distance path which runs from Ballenstedt to Wippra through the neighboring villages of Molmerswende and Steinbrücken. From Schielo, local trails lead to Anhalt Castle and Falkenstein Castle.

==Notable people==
*Karl Blossfeldt (June 13, 1865 – December 9, 1932), photographer, born in Schielo.

<text>Richard Thorpe (born Rollo Smolt Thorpe; February 24, 1896 – May 1, 1991) was an American film director best known for his long career at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

His obituary called him &quot;a capable and versatile director willing to take on any assignment the studio handed him.&quot; He said &quot;I just take them on as they come.&quot;

Thorpe also said &quot;I&#x27;m happy to do any kind of picture. If there&#x27;s a good script I think any director can make a good picture. Actually if it says in the script what you do, I don&#x27;t see why anybody can&#x27;t make it.&quot;

One associate said &quot;“He was a company man, a very pleasant, good-looking, nice, well-behaved guy who took pride in being efficient like some businessman would take pride in the way he ran his bank.”

His two favorite films were &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1937) and &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot; (1944). &quot;They were new and different experiences,&quot; said Thorpe.

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Thorpe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd. In 2003 a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, California was dedicated to him and his son Jerry.

==Biography==
Born Rollo Smolt Thorpe in Hutchinson, Kansas, Richard Thorpe began his entertainment career performing in vaudeville and onstage. In 1921 he began in motion pictures as an actor and directed his first silent film in 1923. He went on to direct more than one hundred and eighty films.

He worked frequently at the Poverty Row studio Chesterfield Pictures during the 1930s.

===MGM===
Thorpe later estimated he &quot;did 72 Westerns, four comedies, 12 serials and 36 independent productions before coming to Metro.&quot;

The first full-length motion picture he directed for MGM was &quot;Last of the Pagans&quot; (1935) starring Ray Mala. Thorpe was assigned to &quot;Tarzan Escapes&quot; which was a huge success as was &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;.

===&quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;===
Thorpe is known as the original director of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). He was fired after two weeks of shooting because it was felt that his scenes did not have the right air of fantasy about them. Thorpe notoriously gave Judy Garland a blonde wig and cutesy &quot;baby-doll&quot; makeup that made her look like a girl in her late teens rather than an innocent Kansas farm girl of about 13. Both makeup and wig were discarded at the suggestion of George Cukor, who was brought in temporarily. Stills from Thorpe&#x27;s work on the film survive today. Further, it is understood that bits of his filmed footage of Toto escaping from the Wicked Witch&#x27;s castle are featured in the film, albeit uncredited.

Thorpe was going to direct &quot;Kim&quot; with Mickey Rooney but the movie was cancelled.

&quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot; would be the first of eleven films Thorpe would make with producer Joe Pasternak. The film was a big hit and helped make a star of Van Johnson.

Thorpe made a number of films with Esther Williams, starting with &quot;Thrill of a Romance&quot;. She recalled, &quot;He was nothing if not efficient, and I soon began to wonder if he hadn’t missed his calling as an accountant. He was cranky, especially in the morning, until he’d downed a pot of coffee; it was wise to keep your distance. Dick didn’t like people who were too cheerful, which meant that he took an instant dislike to me.&quot; Williams says Thorpe constantly bullied and berated her during filming although she says he stopped it after she left the set crying.

Williams says that while making &quot;Fiesta&quot; Thorpe &quot;he was in a worse mood... than he’d been before. He hated Mexico; he hated bullfighting, and above all he hated Ricardo Montalban, who was at least as cheerful as I was.&quot; She did not want to make &quot;This Time for Keeps&quot; with Thorpe but the studio insisted.

Thorpe later said the only film he turned down at MGM was &quot;The Black Hand&quot;. “I didn’t think I could handle Gene Kelly because he had been a director. And after an hour and a half, Schary said, ‘Well, you go ahead and do it.’ So I went ahead and did it.”

===Epics===
At MGM, he teamed up with producer Pandro S. Berman, with whom he made &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952). This was a huge commercial success (earning a DGA nomination for Thorpe) and led to a series of experensive epics produced by Berman, including &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1952), &quot;Knights of the Round Table&quot; (1953), &quot;All the Brothers Were Valiant&quot; (1953) and &quot;The Adventures of Quentin Durward&quot; (1955). Pandro Berman later called Thorpe &quot;the most efficient director I ever knew in terms of things technical. The beauty of Thorpe was that if you had a script he liked, he just shot it.&quot;

Joan Fontaine, who starred in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; later wrote &quot;I found that director Thorpe cared more about the performance of the horses than the actors.&quot;

According to James Mason, when making &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; star Stewart Granger asked to do a second take. Thorpe refused, saying &quot;You can’t improve things to an extent that represents value at the box office. In my experience I have found that if you print the first take which has a reasonable tempo and in which all the actors say their lines in a way that’s completely intelligible then there is no point in retaking it.&quot; Granger confirmed &quot; If you remembered the lines and got through the scene, Richard would print it. He didn’t believe in ten or fifteen takes in order to catch some subtle difference only appreciated by the director. I loved working like this and that’s the reason the film was made in such an incredibly short time.&quot;

Thorpe was noted for working quickly and efficiently—skills he had learned in the 1930s while working for low-budget Chesterfield Pictures. Freddie Young said &quot;Dick Thorpe was the favorite director at MGM because he always finished on schedule. He made a point of it. The studio kept giving him a shorter and shorter schedule, but he always beat it.&quot; Young described Thorpe&#x27;s &quot;special method for working fast&quot;:
On &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; he&#x27;d start with a long shot and keep filming until one of the actors fluffed. &#x27;Cut!&#x27; Then he&#x27;d move the camera to a closer set-up. &#x27;Come on, let&#x27;s go. Action!&#x27; And shoot on until the next hold-up. &#x27;Move in closer still. Continue!&#x27; And so on until we finished up with just two big heads filling the screen. In other words, the close-ups in the finished film were quite arbitrary, depending on the pure chance of the interruptions in shooting on that particular day. Thorpe never reshot anything. That&#x27;s how he beat the schedule. For a cameraman it was boring as hell.

Between the various camera angles, Thorpe shot enough footage to patch together into a completed sequence.

Thorpe also directed &quot;The Girl Who Had Everything&quot; (1951) with Elizabeth Taylor, and two musicals with Edmund Purdom, &quot;The Student Prince&quot; (1954) and &quot;Athena&quot; (1954). &quot;Student Prince&quot; had originally meant to star Mario Lanza.

In 1957 Thorpe made two unsuccessful films, &quot;Tip on a Dead Jockey&quot; and &quot;Ten Thousand Bedrooms&quot;. The latter, Dean Martin&#x27;s first film after breaking up with Jerry Lewis, was a flop. Thorpe followed these with the movie &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, produced by Berman and starring Elvis Presley, which became a huge hit.

==Later career==
Warwick Films borrowed Thorpe to make &quot;Killers of Kilimanjaro&quot; (1959) filmed in Britain and Kenya. He then made &quot;The House of the Seven Hawks&quot; (1959) with Robert Taylor in Europe.

Thorpe directed the epic &quot;The Tartars&quot; (1961) in Yugoslavia with Orson Welles, then filmed a popular romantic comedy &quot;The Honeymoon Machine&quot; (1961) with the team of Jim Hutton and Paula Prentiss, who were later featured in &quot;The Horizontal Lieutenant&quot; (1962). Prentiss was also in &quot;Follow the Boys&quot; (1963) shot in France. Thorpe was reunited with Elvis Presley for &quot;Fun in Acapulco&quot; (1963) at Paramount.

Thorpe made some films in Europe including &quot;The Truth About Spring&quot; (1965) with John and Hayley Mills. At Universal he directed &quot;That Funny Feeling&quot; (1965) with Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin.

After directing &quot;The Last Challenge&quot; in 1967, he retired from the film industry.

==Personal life and death==
He married Belva. They had a son, Jerry Thorpe (1925–2018). In 1959 a judge granted a divorce to his wife Belva on the grounds of cruelty.

Thorpe died in Palm Springs, California on May 1, 1991, at Palm Springs Health Care Nursing facility of complications of old age.

==Critical appraisal==
According to Scott Eyman Thorpe &quot;was hardly ever anything but a by-the-numbers director, albeit a busy one: sixty-six films for MGM in thirty years. Metro tended to use Thorpe for maintenance work on ongoing series — four Tarzan films, two Lassies, a late Thin Man, a dozen musicals for Joe Pasternak, but never one for Arthur Freed. But he lasted longer than anybody at the studio, directing his last MGM film in 1967.&quot;

Another writer said &quot;Thorpe had a reputation as an actor’s director and as a good technician who rarely wasted film, earning him the nickname “One-take Thorpe.” 

Christopher Challis called him &quot;a product of the old studio system [who] had become a director by faithfully adhering to the script with which he was presented. A sad, dour man, his life was dedicated to producing, without innovation, a verbatim representation on film of the approved script, which he felt duty-bound to complete on time and, if possible, under budget.&quot;

<doc id="1090639" wikidata="Q471882" url="?curid=1090639" title="Pasteur Bizimungu">
<text>Pasteur Bizimungu (born April 1950) is a Rwandan politician who served as the third President of Rwanda, holding office from 19 July 1994 until 23 March 2000.

Bizimungu had previously held several positions under President Juvenal Habyarimana throughout the 1980s. He joined the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) rebel group against Habyarimana in 1990 following the death of his brother seemingly under the orders of Habyarimana&#x27;s government. After the RPF&#x27;s victory in the Rwandan Civil War in 1994 which ended the Rwandan genocide, Bizimungu became the new president of the country with RPF commander Paul Kagame as vice-president and minister of defense, who was seen as the country&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader throughout his presidency. Bizumungu&#x27;s presidency was marked by the reconstruction of the country in the wake of the civil war and genocide, as well as the country&#x27;s support for rebel groups in the First Congo War from 1996 to 1997, and the Second Congo War from 1998 to 2003. Following a series of disputes with Kagame, Bizimungu resigned in 2000, whereupon he was succeeded by Kagame. The following year, Bizimungu founded the Party for Democratic Renewal, which was immediately banned by Kagame&#x27;s new government. In 2004, Bizimungu was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for attempting to form a militia, inciting violence, and embezzlement, but was pardoned three years later by Kagame.

== Early life ==
A Rwandan, Bizimingu was born in the Gisenyi prefecture of Rwanda. According to the academic Filip Reyntjens, Bizimungu had ties to radical anti-Tutsi groups as a student in the 1970s, but later joined the RPF. He served as President of Rwanda after the 1994 genocide.

== Relationship to MRND ==
In the 1980s and 1990s, Bizimungu worked within the MRND government which ruled Rwanda until 1994. Prior to 1990, Bizimungu had close ties to Hutu president Juvénal Habyarimana. During this period, he held several positions, including director-general of Electrogaz, the national electricity company.

In 1990 he joined the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) after his brother, a colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces, was murdered. At the time, the RPF was just beginning its invasion of Rwanda from Uganda, starting the Rwandan Civil War. Bizimungu lived in exile in Belgium, serving as the party&#x27;s information officer. In 1993, he helped negotiate the 1993 Arusha Accords.

After Habyarimana&#x27;s death in a plane crash on 6 April 1994, ethnic extremists unleashed the Rwandan genocide.

== Presidency ==
In July 1994 the RPF gained control of the country and established a national unity government. The &quot;de facto&quot; RPF leader, Paul Kagame, was chosen as vice president, and Bizimungu became president.

During Bizimungu&#x27;s administration, many believed that he was merely a figurehead, and Kagame held the real power. Bizimungu soon found himself in conflict with Kagame over what Bizimungu argued was unjustified repression of dissent. Critics accused Bizimungu of corruption, alleging that he had blocked Parliament&#x27;s attempts to censure corrupt ministers, refused to pay compensation to evicted residents on one of his building sites, and dodged Rwandan taxes by registering two of his trucks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Bizimungu resigned in March 2000 in a dispute over the make-up of a new cabinet, and Kagame became president.

Weeks before Bizimungu resigned, his adviser, Assiel Kabera, was killed outside his home by men in military uniforms. It has been alleged that Kabera, a genocide survivor, was killed on the orders of Paul Kagame.

== Party for Democratic Renewal ==
In May 2001, Bizimungu founded a new political party, the Party for Democratic Renewal (PDR), known as Ubuyanja in Kinyarwanda. It was almost immediately banned by the government, which accused it of being a radical Hutu party. Bizimungu was arrested, and Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience.

He was placed under house arrest for continuing the operations of the party on 19 April 2002 and charged with endangering the state. On 7 June 2004 he was sentenced to 15 years in prison for attempting to form a militia, inciting violence, and embezzlement. He received a five-year sentence for each of these convictions, which were to run consecutively.

On 17 February 2006, Bizimungu&#x27;s appeal, based on the fact that he was convicted of crimes different from those with which he was initially charged, was denied by the Supreme Court.

He was released on 6 April 2007, having been pardoned by Kagame. Kagame gave no explanation of the pardon. As of April 2011, PDR co-founder and later co-defendant Charles Ntakirutinka remained in prison, and was named an Amnesty International &quot;priority case.&quot; However, he was released on 1 March 2012 after serving his full ten-year sentence.

== Family ==
Bizimungu&#x27;s wife is Séraphine Utamuliza. He has one son, and two daughters, Alexander Tabara, Nicole Tamara, and Carine Cyuzuzo.

<doc id="1090641" wikidata="Q3574023" url="?curid=1090641" title="Atlantis (1913 film)">
<text>Atlantis is a 1913 Danish silent film directed by August Blom, the head of production at the Nordisk Film company, and was based upon the 1912 novel by Gerhart Hauptmann. It starred an international cast headlined by Danish matinée actor Olaf Fønss and Austrian opera diva Ida Orloff. The film tells the tale of a doctor who travels to the United States in search of a cure for his ailing wife and of the tragic sinking of an ocean liner after it strikes an object at sea. Released only one year after the sinking of the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;, the film drew considerable attention as well as criticism due to similarities to the actual tragedy.

The high production costs for &quot;Atlantis&quot; were not equaled by box office returns at that time. However, the film went on to become the most watched film for Nordisk Film and has been hailed by film historian Erik Ulrichsen as a Danish masterpiece and &quot;one of the first modern films.&quot;

==Plot==
Dr. Friedrich von Kammacher (Olaf Fønss), a surgeon, is devastated after his wife develops a brain disorder and is institutionalized. On the advice of his parents, von Kammacher leaves Denmark to gain some respite from his wife&#x27;s illness. Von Kammacher travels to Berlin, where he meets a young dancer named Ingigerd Hahlstrom (Ida Orloff) and the doctor becomes fond of her and very interested in her. However she has a large number of admirers and thus Von Kammacher gives up on her. However, while in Paris he sees an advertisement in the paper that she is going to New York with her father and decides to follow her. Von Kammacher buys a first class ticket on the same liner as Ingigerd, the &quot;SS Roland&quot;.

Aboard the ship, von Kammacher learns Ingigerd has a boyfriend with her and thus he backs down. Shortly after, he is called to treat a young Russian-Jewish woman with seasickness and they nearly get romantically involved but class stops this from happening.

Halfway across the sea the &quot;Roland&quot; strikes an unseen object which causes massive flooding and dooms the ship. The passengers panic as the ship sinks into the Atlantic. Von Kammacher finds Ingigerd passed out in her cabin from shock and carries her to a lifeboat. He goes back and searches in vain for her father but when he can&#x27;t find him, von Kammacher returns to the lifeboat and holds Ingigerds hand as the lifeboat pulls away. The liner sinks so rapidly that many of the lifeboats are never launched and several passengers are swept into the sea and drowned. By morning, von Kammacher&#x27;s lifeboat is still floating and ten souls still alive. They are spotted by a cargo liner &quot;Hjortholm&quot; and saved.

Survivors arrive in New York, von Kammacher tries to tell her that he loves her and wants a life with her in New York but she refuses to be tied down by one man. He gives up on her and they go their separate ways. Von Kammacher is impressed by an art gallery and takes an interest in fine art. Through the artistic community, he is introduced to a kind and pleasant sculptor Miss Eva Burns, and they develop a friendship. Dr. Schmidt, who is a friend of von Kammacher, offers him the use of a mountain cabin near Handon, where it is hoped that Friedrich will find some peace and solace. While he is in the mountains, a telegram from Denmark arrives with information that von Kammacher&#x27;s wife has died. Upon hearing the news, Friedrich falls critically ill. Eva takes it upon herself to tend to him in the mountain cabin. As she nurses him back to health, their relationship blossoms. Happiness returns to Friedrich&#x27;s life as he realizes Eva will be a good mother for his children.

==Production==
Due to the large number of cast, extras, and locations, and the amount of equipment, Blom took the unusual step of employing two assistant directors for filming. The first was Robert Dinesen who later had his own successful career as a director with Nordisk Film in Denmark and Germany. The second assistant was the young Hungarian director Mihály Kertész, who under the name Michael Curtiz became one of the most well-known Hollywood directors through films such as &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;White Christmas&quot;. Curtiz also appeared in &quot;Atlantis&quot; in a small supporting role.

To film the shipboard scenes, Nordisk Film chartered the Danish ocean liner &quot;C. F. Tietgen&quot;. However, the &quot;Atlantis&quot; sinking scene used a large-scale model and about 500 extras as swimmers, and was filmed in the bay off Køge, Denmark.

Blom filmed two endings for the movie—one happy and one tragic. The alternate tragic ending, in which the Doctor dies at the end, was made in particular for the Russian market. It was believed that the Russians had a preference for sad endings.

===&quot;Titanic&quot; myth===
Some sources claimed that the sinking ship scenes were inspired by the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking which had occurred the previous year. However, Blom based his film entirely on Gerhardt Hauptmann&#x27;s 1912 novel, &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Hauptmann&#x27;s novel was published in serialized form in the &quot;Berliner Tageblatt&quot; a month before the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. Nevertheless, due to the film&#x27;s release only one year after the &quot;Titanic&quot; sinking, &quot;Atlantis&quot; became associated with the &quot;Titanic&quot;. In Norway, the film was banned because authorities felt it was in poor taste to turn a tragedy into entertainment.

===Casting===
Because his original story was partly autobiographical, Hauptmann&#x27;s contract with Nordisk Film required two roles be acted by the actual people who were their inspiration. A letter from Nordisk Film to Fred A. Talbot of England explained, &quot;...the part of &quot;Ingigerd&quot; and the armless virtuoso &quot;Arthur Stoss&quot; were played by the very same persons, who , so to speak, used as models by Gerhart Hauptmann, when he wrote his famous novel. These two artists, Miss Ida Orloff and Mr. C. Unthan (these are their real names) were his traveling companions on the trip across the Atlantic.&quot; Orloff had had a romantic relationship with Hauptmann beginning several years earlier when she was a 16-year-old cabaret dancer. Reviewers of &quot;Atlantis&quot; criticized the choice of Orloff because, by the time of filming, she was no longer a svelte athletic dancer who could embody the eroticism of the part. Nevertheless, Nordisk Films had been forced to cast her.

The other required actor was Carl Herman Unthan (credited as Charles Unthan), a Prussian violinist who had been born without arms and learned to use his feet as hands. He played the role of Arthur Stoss, an armless virtuoso. Although his abilities were impressive, critics of &quot;Atlantis&quot; felt his appearance in the film was simply extraneous and non-integral to the story.

Another notable actor in &quot;Atlantis&quot; was Torben Meyer who went on to a long Hollywood career as a comedic character actor, usually playing a thick-accented waiter or maitr&#x27;de. Some film historians have also spotted Danish comedian Carl Schenstrøm, later the tall half of the Pat and Patachon comedy team, playing a waiter in the film. Although Schenstrøm was employed at Nordisk Film at the time, his participation has not been fully established.

==American distribution==
Distribution of the film in the United States began in 1914 through the Great Northern Film Company. Like many American films of the time, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required cuts in two scenes with nude statues where the sex was visible.

==Restored version==
&quot;Atlantis&quot; was restored and released on laserdisc in 1993 and in DVD format in 2005. The restoration was created through a high definition scan of a restored negative and the tinting was recreated using an abbreviated version from The National Film Center in Japan.
The restored version also was made with combined intertitles in Danish and English. Extra material on the DVD included the two-minute alternative ending originally filmed for Russian audiences and the 15-minute surviving fragment of August Blom&#x27;s and Holger-Madsen&#x27;s 1914 film &quot;Liebelei&quot;.

<doc id="1090642" wikidata="Q2994663" url="?curid=1090642" title="2-8-0">
<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, usually in a leading truck, eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles, and no trailing wheels. In the United States and elsewhere, this wheel arrangement is commonly known as a Consolidation, after the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad’s &quot;Consolidation&quot;, the name of the first 2-8-0.

The notation 2-8-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement, the &quot;T&quot; suffix indicating a locomotive on which the water is carried in side-tanks mounted on the engine rather than in an attached tender.

The Consolidation represented a notable advance in locomotive power. After 1875, it became &quot;the most popular type of freight locomotive in the United States and was built in greater quantities than any other single wheel arrangement.&quot;
==Overview==
Of all the locomotive types that were created and experimented with in the 19th century, the 2-8-0 was a relative latecomer.

The first locomotive of this wheel arrangement was possibly built by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Like the first 2-6-0s, this first 2-8-0 had a leading axle that was rigidly attached to the locomotive&#x27;s frame, rather than on a separate truck or bogie. To create this 2-8-0, PRR master mechanic John P. Laird modified an existing 0-8-0, the &quot;Bedford&quot;, between 1864 and 1865.

The 2-6-0 Mogul type, first created in the early 1860s, is often considered as the logical forerunner to the 2-8-0. However, a claim is made that the first true 2-8-0 engine evolved from the 0-8-0 and was ordered by the United States&#x27; Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad, which named all its engines. The name given to the new locomotive was &quot;Consolidation&quot;, the name that was later almost globally adopted for the type. According to this viewpoint, the first 2-8-0 order by Lehigh dates to 1866 and antedates the adoption of the type by other railways and coal and mountain freight haulers.

From its introduction in 1866 and well into the early 20th century, the 2-8-0 design was considered to be the ultimate heavy-freight locomotive. The 2-8-0&#x27;s forte was starting and moving &quot;impressive loads at unimpressive speeds&quot; and its versatility gave the type its longevity. The practical limit of the design was reached in 1915, when it was realised that no further development was possible with a locomotive of this wheel arrangement.

==Usage==
As in the United States, the 2-8-0 was also a popular type in Europe, again largely as a freight hauler. The type was also used in Australia, New Zealand, and Southern Africa.

===Australia===
The 2-8-0 locomotive was used extensively throughout Australia. It served on the broad gauge, and narrow gauge and was employed mostly as a freight locomotive, although it was often also employed in passenger service in Victoria.

The first Australian locomotive class with this wheel arrangement were the Queensland Railways C13 and C15, built as goods locomotives in 1879 by Baldwin Locomotive Works. Another lot of Consolidation engines consisted of 20 standard-gauge New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) J Class engines, which arrived from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1891. The Js remained in service until 1915, when they were withdrawn. Wartime shortages between 1916 and 1920 had six engines re-entering service after being shopped and fitted with superheaters. The last engine of this class was finally withdrawn in 1934 and all were scrapped by 1937.

The next batch of NSW 2-8-0 locomotives to appear, between 1896 and 1916, was the T class engines. The class was delivered from one local and several overseas builders, 151 locomotives from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company, 84 from North British Locomotive Company, 10 from Neilson &amp; Company, 30 from Clyde Engineering in Australia, and five from Dübs &amp; Company. During World War II, 14 of these locomotives were equipped with superheaters, which raised their tractive effort from to .

From 1899, the Victorian Railways (VR) also used a range of broad-gauge 2-8-0 locomotives.
* The first of these locomotives were the Baldwin-built V class. These engines were built at Phoenix Foundry in Ballarat. By 1930, they had disappeared from the VR.
* The VR&#x27;s next type was the 26 C class engines, which saw freight and passenger service.
* In 1922, a smaller and lighter 2-8-0, the K class, was introduced for branchline freight and later also passenger services.

* Finally, the VR introduced sixty light 2-8-0 J class engines in 1954. These also worked both freight and passenger services.

The first 2-8-0 engines in private service on the Midland Railway of Western Australia arrived in 1912. These were gauge locomotives. The five in the class operated until 1958. All were gone by 1963.

In 1912, some of the NSWGR T class types were also purchased by the private East Greta Railway, later to become the South Maitland Railway, but these were converted to 2-8-2 tank locomotives. The class proved to be successful throughout its long service life, until being retired from government revenue service in 1973.

During 1916, Commonwealth Railways acquired eight K class for the Trans-Australian Railway.

In 1924, a private coal company, J &amp; A Brown in NSW, obtained three ex-British military Railway Operating Division ROD 2-8-0 locomotives. Brown later ordered another 10 of these locomotives, but only nine of that order arrived in Australia. The last was withdrawn in 1973.

===Belgium===
To compensate for wartime losses, Belgian railways acquired 300 2-8-0 locomotives in 1946. They were built in North America, 160 by Montreal Locomotive Works in Canada, 60 by the Canadian Locomotive Company, and 80 by the American Locomotive Company in the United States. These machines proved to be very reliable and were used for mixed traffic until the end of the steam era, when number 29.013 hauled the last scheduled steam passenger train from Ath to Denderleeuw on 20 December 1966.

This locomotive survived in preservation and is used on special excursions. On 16 December 2006, number 29.013 re-enacted the last 1966 run on the same route.

===Canada===

The Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) N-2-a, b, and c class locomotives were a class of altogether 182 &quot;Consolidation&quot; type locomotives, built by Montreal Locomotive Works between 1912 and 1914. They were numbered in the range from 3600 to 3799 and were used almost everywhere around the system. The order for these engines came about when CP needed bigger locomotives for their mainline since their current engines were wearing out and were too small for the loads that were being hauled. Most of the class were converted to oil-firing in later years.

One of the locomotives, No. 3716, is run and maintained in Summerland, BC as part of the Kettle Valley Steam Railway.

===Finland===
Finland had five tender locomotive classes with a 2-8-0 wheel arrangement, the classes Tk1, Tk2, Tk3, Tv1, and Tv2. The class Tk1s were numbered from 271 to 290 and were nicknamed &quot;Amerikan Satikka&quot;.
The class Tk2s were numbered 407 to 426 and 457 to 470. They were nicknamed &quot;Satikka&quot;. Three were preserved, No. 407 at Närpes, No. 418 at Junction City, Oregon, in the United States, and No. 419 at Haapamäki. The class Tk3s were numbered 800 to 899, 1100 to 1118, and 1129 to 1170. They were built by Tampella, Lokomo, and Frichs. The class Tv1s were numbered 594 to 617, 685 to 741, 900 to 948, and 1200 to 1211. They were built by Tampella and were nicknamed &quot;Jumbo&quot;. Four were preserved, No. 609 at Haapamäki, No. 933 at the Veturi museum at Toijala, No. 940 at Lapinlahti and No. 943 at Ylivieska. The class Tv2s were numbered from 618 to 637. They were nicknamed &quot;Wilson&quot;. Only No. 618 was preserved, also at Haapamäki.

Finland had only one tank locomotive class with a 2-8-0 wheel arrangement, the class M1 consisting of one solitary locomotive numbered 66. It was not preserved.

===Germany===
The 2-8-0 wheel arrangement enjoyed a brief period of popularity in Germany during the era of the &quot;Länderbahnen&quot; or State Railways, from about 1840 to 1920, prior to the establishment after the First World War of the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot;, the German National Railways. Under the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft&quot; (DRG) classification system, all 2-8-0 locomotives were assigned to class 56 (&quot;Baureihe&quot; or BR 56), with different types receiving subclassifications. The earliest type was the Prussian G73 of 1893.
===Indonesia===

In response to the increasing need for freight and passenger transports on the Buitenzorg–Bandung–Banjar line, the Java Staatsspoorwegen at the time ordered 42 &quot;Consolidation&quot; locomotives from 4 different engine manufacturers, including Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM), Hanomag, Hartmann and Werkspoor, came in 1914, 1915 and 1921, classified as SS Class 900 (901–942). These locomotives were made to fulfill the requirements that submitted by SS, being able to haul 550 tons of freight with speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph) or 30 km/h (18.6 mph) on lines with a gradient of 4% or 1 in 25. In order to be able to negotiate 150 meters curve radius, the leading wheels adopted Adam axle system which could enable to turn radially by 70 mm. As for the fourth driving wheels, adopted &quot;Golsdorf&quot; axle system (patented by Karl Golsdorf), this make the outer driving wheels able to move laterally by 100 mm. As by result, it&#x27;s not only able to turn at 150 meters curve radius, but speeds up to 75 km/h (46.6 mph) was made possible from its initial of 50 km/h (31 mph). Based on record in 1938, the SS Class 900/DKA 50s ever been used to haul the &quot;Eendaagsche Express&quot; or One Day Express train on Bandung–Banjar southern-west line replacing the SS Class 1250 (DKA DD52) due to resource and asset saving policies during Great Depression and SS Class 1700/DKA C30s which were considered to be inefficient in serving the increasingly congested volume of freights and passenger transport. In 1939, the &quot;Eendaagsche Express&quot; shortened the time journey for Bandung–Yogyakarta–Surabaya to only 11 hours. These locomotives worked on Bandung–Purwakarta–Batavia line and also assigned to work the eastern express trains in East Java on Banyuwangi–Surabaya line in tandem with SS Class 1100 (DKA C27). To make the SS 900s have the characteristics of express locomotive, each unit received the modification of two pair of smoke deflectors. In the need of increasing freight transport in South Sumatra, the Java Staatsspoorwegen allocated 4 of them to serve coal transport from Bukit Asam to Kertapati. Not quite a long, the South Sumatra division of SS or so called &quot;Zuid-Sumatra Staatsspoorwegen&quot; (ZSS) were also ordered 11 of these from two German engine manufacturers, 5 were imported from Hartmann in 1925 and the rest of 6 from Hanomag in 1926. 

==== Preservation ====

During Japanese occupation in 1942, all Dutch East Indies railway locomotives were renumbered based on Japanese numberings, this including the SS Class 900s were renumbered to D50s and this numbering system still used after the Independence of Indonesia by &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot; (DKA) or Department of Railways of the Republic of Indonesia up to now. During Indonesian National Revolution some of SS Class 900/DKA D50 were used among the others to haul trains belonging to Republican fighters and the Dutch military. In some records, some of them were destroyed in action due to the conflict. While the SS911 or DKA D50 11 was captured by 2nd Company of &quot;1e Bataljon, 15 Regiment Infanterie&quot; of Dutch Marines during Operation Kraai in Yogyakarta. After the acknowledgement of Indonesian sovereignty by Dutch in 1949, the SS Class 900 were transferred to &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot;. In 1976, most of D50s were found regularly in Jember, East Java which many of them had been dumped out and seemed to be derelict. While the rest of them are still used regularly in South Sumatra pulling some coal trains. Out of 61 units, only DKA D50 11 (ex-SS911) survived and now preserved as static display in Transportation Museum of Taman Mini Indonesia Indah.

===Italy===
In Italy, the state-controlled railways company &quot;Ferrovie dello Stato&quot; (FS), after comparing two models of 2-8-0 engine in 1906 (a simple-expansion [simplex] locomotive purchased from Baldwin and a compound type assembled by German and Italian builders) opted for a simplex 2-8-0 as basic power for its freight and mixed trains. Production of such locomotives, classified Gr. 740 in Italy, began in 1911 and stopped four years later when Italy entered the First World War.

Thereafter, Italian industry was devoted to producing military equipment, so FS bought locomotives from North American firms. From 1917 to 1922, American Locomotive Company and Montreal Locomotive Works built 400 2-8-0 locomotives for Italy but only 393 were delivered. The FS classified these engines as Gr. 735 and used them for freight and passenger services. After the war, the supply of Italian-built Gr. 740 resumed. Both Gr. 740 and Gr 735, very similar in performance, remained in service until the end of the 1960s.
===Japan===

The Baldwin supplied the first three 2-8-0 9000 class locomotives for export to Japan in 1893, in use of Hokkaido Colliery and Railway Company, which were taken over Japanese Government Railway under Railway Nationalization Act of 1906.

Among several classes, most successful examples were 770 of JNR Class 9600, built from 1913 to 1926. Some independent shortlines had equivalent locomotives to 9600 both factory-new and secondhand from JNR, the last example was Yubari Colliery and Railway No. 21, built in 1941 by Kawasaki. Despite obsolescence and early replacement by 2-8-2 D51, 9600s were still widely utilized thanks to high performance and appropriate route availability. The last example, No. 79602, kept longevity until March 1976, making the very final steam traction in service on JNR. No. 79602 was nearly preserved, however, sadly, subsequently destroyed by arson attack at Oiwake MPD.

===New Zealand===
Several 2-8-0 locomotives were supplied to New Zealand by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia in the United States. Six O Class locomotives were built for the New Zealand Railways in 1885.

The Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company, which operated the Wellington-Manawatu line, had four similar locomotives built by Baldwin, two in 1888, one in 1894 and one in 1896. The WMR locomotives of 1894 and 1896, No. 12 and No. 13, were Vauclain compound locomotives, the first in New Zealand and the first narrow-gauge compounds in the world. While standard gauge compounds usually had the low-pressure cylinder mounted below the high-pressure cylinder on each side, this was often reversed on narrow-gauge locomotives, which had the larger low-pressure cylinders mounted above the high-pressure cylinders to provide greater clearance at platforms.

In 1908, when the WMR was nationalized, these locomotives were classified into three NZR subclasses because of detail differences, the two 1888 locomotives as OB class, the 1894 locomotive as OA class, and the 1896 locomotive as OC class.

===North Korea===

The Korean State Railway have locally built 500-series (used by rubber recycling plant) and 810 series Japanese built narrow gauge (762mm) 2-8-0 locomotives. The 810 series was likely retired in 2006 and 500-series may still be operating.

===Russia===
In Russia, the 2-8-0 wheel arrangement was represented by the prerevolutionary Sch (Shuka-pike) class. These two-cylinder compound locomotives without superheaters were declared the standard Russian freight locomotive in 1912, but since they were relatively low-powered, they were only useful on easier lines without steep gradients such as the Saint Petersburg-Moscow route.

===South Africa===
Five 2-8-0 locomotive classes saw service in South Africa, all of them initially acquired by the Cape Government Railways (CGR), which classified all but two as 8th Class. All of them were variations on the same design, used saturated steam, and had cylinders with overhead slide valves, actuated by inside Stephenson valve gear.

* In 1901 and 1902, the CGR placed 16 &quot;Consolidation&quot;s in service. Designed by H.M. Beatty, chief locomotive superintendent of the CGR from 1896 to 1910, they were ordered from the Schenectady Locomotive Works in the United States and partly delivered by Schenectady in 1901, with the remainder delivered from the newly established American Locomotive Company in 1902. Conceived as mixed-traffic locomotives, they had bar frames and narrow fireboxes. In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR), they were designated Class 8X.
* In 1902, the CGR also placed a single experimental tandem compound &quot;Consolidation&quot; in service, based on its Schenectady/ALCO-built 8th Class. Delivered by ALCO in 1902, the locomotive was not classified and was simply referred to as the Tandem Compound. In 1912, it was designated Class Experimental 2 on the SAR.

* In 1903, the CGR received a second experimental tandem compound &quot;Consolidation&quot; from ALCO. It was similar to the earlier one, but with a larger fire grate and an increased heating surface which enhanced its steaming ability. It also remained unclassified and was also simply referred to as a Tandem Compound. In 1912, it was designated Class Experimental 3 on the SAR.
* Also in 1903, the CGR received four more &quot;Consolidation&quot;s from Kitson and Company of Hunslet in Leeds. They were very similar to the earlier Schenectady and ALCO-built &quot;Consolidation&quot;s, but with the boiler pitch raised by . Coupled with a shallow firebox, this enabled the grate to be extended out sideways over the fourth set of drivers, resulting in a grate area of compared to the of the previous model. In 1912, they were designated Class 8Y on the SAR.

* In 1904, the CGR placed its last eight &quot;Consolidation&quot;s in service. These were ordered from the North British Locomotive Company of Glasgow in Scotland and were very similar to the previous four Kitson-built locomotives, but slightly larger in boiler and firegrate area dimensions. In 1912, these eight were designated Class 8Z on the SAR.

While subjecting the &quot;Consolidation&quot;s to exhaustive testing on all types of traffic and under varying conditions, some trouble was experienced with the leading pony truck and it was dropped in favour of a four-wheeled bogie in later orders for more eighth class locomotives. All subsequent Cape eighth class locomotives were therefore built with a &quot;Mastodon&quot; wheel arrangement.

===South West Africa===

In 1907 and 1910, the &quot;Staatsbahn Keetmanshoop&quot; (Keetmanshoop State Railway) in German South West Africa placed 21 tank locomotives in service. After the first World War, when all railways in the territory came under the administration of the South African Railways in 1922, five locomotives of the batch of 1910 survived. They were not classified or renumbered, but were referred to as the eight-coupled tanks.

In 1911, nine tender locomotives were placed in service by the &quot;Staatsbahn Lüderitzbucht-Keetmanshoop&quot; (Lüderitzbucht-Keetmanshoop State Railway). After the first World War, all nine locomotives came onto the roster of the SAR, where they were referred to as the eight-coupled tenders.
===Sweden===

The unusual M3t Turbine Steam Locomotive was of this type. 90 of the Swedish E (0-8-0) class were rebuilt between 1935 and 1951 and given a lead truck, designated the class E2.
===Turkey===

Turkey was a neutral country during the Second World War and to retain Turkish goodwill, Great Britain supplied several locomotives to the Turkish Railways, where they were classified 8F.

Two of these 8F class locomotives were brought back from Turkey early in 2011 and one of them is on display at the National Railway Museum in Shildon, England.

===United Kingdom===

The 2-8-0 gradually became the standard heavy-freight steam locomotive type in the United Kingdom during the first half of the 20th century, replacing the 0-8-0 types that had appeared as mineral locomotives in the 1890s. These had themselves been a replacement for these heavier tasks of the 0-6-0 locomotives used for freight since the mid 19th century. The 0-6-0 remained a common type for lighter use and on branch lines, but the 0-8-0 largely disappeared in favour of the better-riding 2-8-0.

The first 2-8-0 to be built in Britain was the Great Western Railway&#x27;s 2800 Class, with 84 locomotives built between 1903 and 1919, followed by a further 83 of the very similar GWR 2884 Class between 1938 and 1942. In 1904, George Whale of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) began to rebuild some of his predecessor&#x27;s Class B 0-8-0 compound locomotives to 2-8-0, classes E and F.

With coal trains increasing in size and scale, the GWR needed to develop a more powerful locomotive to meet these requirements, on what were relatively short haul routes. Thus in 1906, Chief Engineer G.J. Churchward took the basic design of his GWR 2800 Class, and adapted it. After proposing a 2-8-2T design, Churchward developed the UK&#x27;s first 2-8-0 tank engine, the 4200 class.
In 1911, John G. Robinson of the Great Central Railway (GCR) introduced his very successful GCR Class 8K for heavy freight. 129 of these were originally built by the GCR. During the First World War, the design was adopted by the Ministry of Munitions and it became the standard locomotive of the Railway Operating Division of the Royal Engineers as the ROD 2-8-0. Altogether, 521 of these ROD locomotives were built during the war. After the war, large numbers of these were purchased by the LNWR and GWR, while some were also sold to a private Australian coal company, J&amp;A Brown in New South Wales. Altogether, 273 were purchased by the LNWR during the early 1920s.
Other successful 2-8-0 designs were built in the UK. The GNR Class O1 and O2 were introduced by Nigel Gresley of the Great Northern Railway in 1913 and 1918, respectively, and the Class 7F by Henry Fowler of the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway in 1914. Whilst most British 2-8-0 designs were intended for heavy freight, the GWR 4700 Class were designed for heavy mixed-traffic work, but were initially employed mainly on fast overnight freight trains; later they were used on express excursions in the summer.

The most successful British 2-8-0 class was the Class 8F, designed in 1935 by William Stanier for the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. By 1946, 852 had been built. During the Second World War, the War Department originally chose the class 8F as its standard freight locomotive, and large numbers of them saw service overseas, notably in the Middle East.

The Class 8F was superseded after 1943 by the cheaper WD Austerity 2-8-0 for war service. A total of 935 of these were built and again, many saw service overseas.

===United States===

In the United States, only a few railroads purchased &quot;Consolidation&quot; types when Baldwin Locomotive Works first introduced its version. Even the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad, which eventually had nearly 180 locomotives in regular service by 1885, did not purchase any of this type until 1873. The Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, which eventually became part of B&amp;O, purchased 15 of this type from Brooks Locomotive Works in 1883.

The 2-8-0 design was given a major boost in 1875, when the Pennsylvania Railroad made it their standard freight locomotive, and 1875 was also when the Erie Railroad began replacing its 4-4-0s in freight service with 2-8-0s. The railroads had found that the 2-8-0 could move trains twice as heavy at half the cost of its predecessors. From a financial standpoint at the time, the choice of the 2-8-0 as new freight locomotive was therefore clear.

The S160 Class of the United States Army Transportation Corps was built by American manufacturers and was designed for use in Europe for heavy freight work during the Second World War. A total of 2,120 of this class was built and they worked on railroads across the world. Production of the 2-8-0 type in the United States totalled more than 23,000 locomotives, of which 12,000 were export versions.

====Preservation====
Great Northern Railway Consolidation No. 1147 is on display in a park in Wenatchee, Washington.

Great Northern Railway Consolidation No. 1246 is in storage in southern Oregon.

Maine Central class W 2-8-0 locomotives numbered 501 and 519 were officially property of the European and North American Railway (E&amp;NA) as a condition of the lease of that company by the Maine Central Railroad. While all other Maine Central steam locomotives were scrapped when replaced by diesel locomotives, these two survived as a lease obligation until Maine Central purchased E&amp;NA in 1955. The advantages of preservation were recognized by that date, so No. 501 is awaiting restoration to operating condition at the Conway Scenic Railroad in Conway, New Hampshire, and No. 519 was on display at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Southern Pacific No. 895, a 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; locomotive built by ALCO in 1913 is on static display at Roseland Park in Baytown, Texas. SP No. 895 was retired after 44 years of service and donated by Southern Pacific Railroad to the Robert E. Lee High School Key Club, then towed on temporary tracks to its current location at Roseland Park in April, 1957.

Baltimore &amp; Ohio No. 545 &quot;A.J Cromwell&quot;, built in 1888, is preserved at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.
The Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s locomotive No. 2562 was built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1909, serial No. 29064. It is on exhibit in the Arizona Railway Museum in Chandler, Arizona. The locomotive and its tender are listed in the National Register of Historic Places, reference No. 09000511.

The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad&#x27;s class 759 locomotive No. 761 was built around 1890. When active, it was used on the railroad&#x27;s mainline between Chicago and the west. No. 761 is plinthed next to the historic Wickenburg, Arizona, train depot that is now the town&#x27;s visitor center.

Santa Fe class 769 locomotive No. 769 is currently on static display in Madrid, New Mexico, but is awaiting a future restoration to run on the Santa Fe Southern Railway.

Denver and Rio Grande Western No. 346 is operational at the Colorado Railroad Museum. Rio Grande No. 318 is also on static display at the same museum.

Denver and Rio Grande Western No. 315 is operational and owned by the Durango Historical Society. 

The Colorado &amp; Southern (C&amp;S) narrow-gauge No. 60 is on display in Idaho Springs, Colorado, while C&amp;S No. 71 is in Central City, Colorado.

A Ks1 class 2-8-0, No. 630, is run and maintained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, by the Tennessee Valley Railroad Museum. In 2014, this locomotive participated in the Norfolk Southern 21st Century Steam program.

In 1962, the Arcade &amp; Attica Railroad purchased an ALCO-build locomotive from the Boyne City Railroad in Michigan. The locomotive, now numbered 18, is billed as the last operating steam excursion in New York State.

Three out of the four SC-1 hogs from the Lake Superior and Ishpeming survived being scrapped. Engine No. 33 has been restored by the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway, before being purchased by the Age of Steam Roundhouse in Sugarcreek, Ohio, where it operates today. Engine No. 35 has been on static display at the Illinois Railway Museum in Union, Illinois since 1985.

In 1991, the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, based in Cumberland, Maryland, acquired SC-1 class No. 734. The locomotive was restored to operating condition and cosmetically changed to look like an original Western Maryland 2-8-0. The locomotive was renumbered 734 in honor, so to speak, of the H-7 (Nos. 701-764) class of 2-8-0 that the Western Maryland harbored and of which none was preserved, although it has an overall appearance of an H-8. Over the years it was overworked and according to the WMSR 734 is in very poor mechanical condition. It was pulled from service officially in 2016. As of 2023, Mountain Thunder, as No. 734 is nicknamed, is awaiting funds for evaluation to determine if overhaul and restoration is possible.

In the late 1980s, four ex-LS&amp;I 2-8-0s were purchased by the Grand Canyon Railway based in Williams, Arizona. They were Nos. 18, 19, 20, and 29. Only No. 29 remains in Williams, undergoing its 1,472-day inspection, while No. 18 is undergoing a rebuild at the Colebrookdale Railroad in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, No. 19 is on static display in Frisco, Texas, and No. 20 is on static display in Allan, Texas.

Other preserved Ex-LS&amp;I 2-8-0s include No. 21, which is being rebuilt in Baraboo, Wisconsin, No. 22, which is on static display at the Mid-Continent Railway Museum in North Freedom, Wisconsin, No. 23, which is being rebuilt at the Empire State Railway Museum in Phoenicia, New York, and No. 24, which is on static display at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

UPRR No. 561 is on static display along US Highway 81 in Columbus, Nebraska.

UPRR No. 423 is on static display on 10th street in Gering, Nebraska.

UPRR No. 6072 is on static display at Wyman park in Fort Riley, Kansas.

Baldwin Locomotive Works No. 40, built in December 1925 for the Lancaster and Chester Railroad in South Carolina, and later purchased by the Cliffside Railroad in North Carolina, now pulls scenic excursion trains at the New Hope and Ivyland Railroad in New Hope, Pennsylvania, which opened in August, 1966.

Great Western No. 60, built in August 1937 by the American Locomotive Company in Schenectady, New York, is currently operated on the Black River and Western Railroad in Ringoes, New Jersey. No. 60 originally operated on the Great Western Railway of Colorado.

Baldwin Steam Locomotive No. 1702, built in 1942 for the United States Army, was purchased by the Great Smoky Mountains Railroad (GSMR) of Bryson City, North Carolina, in the mid-1990s for use on its scenic railway excursions. After a decade of service, No. 1702 was retired in 2004. In October 2012, a partnership formed between GSMR and Swain County to provide funding to restore the locomotive. In 2013, a complete restoration was launched and the locomotive returned to service during summer 2016.
Pennsylvania Railroad No. 1187, of the class R, later H3, is on display at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This class is described in detail in the book &quot;Set Up Running: The Life of a Pennsylvania Railroad Engineman 1904-1949&quot;.

The Valley Railroad, operating in Connecticut as the Essex Steam Train and Riverboat, has one 2-8-0, No. 97 built in 1923 by the American Locomotive Company’s Cooke Machine Works in Paterson, New Jersey for use in Cuba. It stayed at Cooke until the Works’ closure in 1926 and started service on the Birmingham and Southeastern Railroad in Alabama as No. 200. It ran various excursions on the Vermont Railway and New Haven Railroad in the late 1960s under a private owner. No. 97 arrived in Essex in 1970 initially operating between 1973 and 2010. It returned to service in October 2018.

Virginia &amp; Truckee No. 29 is currently operational on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad headquartered in Virginia City, Nevada.

Two USATC &quot;General Pershing&quot; locomotives survive in the United States. No. 28 is currently undergoing repair to run again at the Texas State Railroad in Palestine, Texas, and No. 101 is on static display at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wisconsin.

<text>″Cameo″ is a cultivar of apple, discovered by chance by the Caudle family in a Dryden, Washington orchard in 1987. Its parentage is uncertain; it may be a cross between &#x27;Red Delicious&#x27; and &#x27;Golden Delicious&#x27;, since it was found near orchards of those fruits; it also appears similar to the original &#x27;Delicious&#x27; cultivar. It is bright red striped over creamy orange, firm and crisp with an aromatic flavor. It is among the top nine most grown apples in Washington state.

<text>The Cope, or the Templecrone Agricultural Co-operative Society (), is a co-operative retail chain indigenous to The Rosses area of County Donegal in Ireland. Founded in 1906, it has a number of normal supermarkets as well as a full department store, a builders merchants and an agricultural division.

The name comes from the inability of one of the founder shareholders to say &quot;Co-Op&quot; - as he could pronounce Cope, the name The Cope was adopted. For the same reason, some people use the term to refer to the group in the U.K. named The Co-operative Group.

Outside of Donegal, the name is perhaps best known for being the semi-official nickname of a local politician Pat &quot;the Cope&quot; Gallagher, who is a former Minister of State. His family were connected to the foundation of the co-operative.
The founder of the chain, Patrick Gallagher (grandfather of the above, and known as Paddy &quot;the Cope&quot;), featured on a 48c Irish stamp released on 16 January 2006, depicted in front of the group&#x27;s first Dungloe store.

The supermarket section of its flagship Dungloe department store was destroyed in a fire in April 2006, although a reduced supermarket service was resumed within two weeks from elsewhere on the site. Construction of a new supermarket began in January 2007 and has since been completed. Initially co-branded as a Vivo store, and latterly a Eurospar, it has since returned to only Cope branding.

The Cope has branches in the town of Dungloe, as well as Annagry, Falcarragh and Kincasslagh villages. They formerly had branches in Burtonport and Narin, but they have been closed; with the former branch in Lettermacaward now operated privately. The Narin branch was re-opened on its original site for Summer 2019 only.

The Dungloe store is a full service department store, with the Falcarragh branch also carrying some homewares and hardware in addition to the food business. The Dungloe and Kincasslagh stores host the An Post post office for their communities, while the separate Dungloe hardware/agricultural store carries Topline Hardware franchise branding.

<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives, 2-2-0 represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, two powered driving wheels on one axle, and no trailing wheels. This configuration, which became very popular during the 1830s, was commonly called the Planet type after the first locomotive, Robert Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Planet&quot; of 1830.

==Equivalent classifications==
Other equivalent classifications are:
*UIC classification: 1A (also known as German classification and Italian classification)
*French classification: 110
*Turkish classification: 12
*Swiss classification: 1/2

==History==

===Great Britain===
After early experience with the 0-2-2 configuration on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, Robert Stephenson decided to build a locomotive with cylinders inside the frames, for which a 2-2-0 was preferable.
The first such locomotive was &quot;Planet&quot;, built in 1830 and the company went on to build a further eighteen examples for the railway. In 1835 five examples were supplied to the London and Greenwich Railway. After 1836 Edward Bury built sixty-nine bar frame 2-2-0 locomotives for the London and Birmingham Railway. The steam roller and traction engine company Aveling and Porter built a number of 2-2-0 locomotives, some of which were convertible traction engines.

===North America===
Tom Thumb, the first American-built steam locomotive used on a common-carrier railroad, built by Peter Cooper in 1830 was a gear-driven 2-2-0, but the type was not perpetuated.

===Ireland===
The Dublin and Kingstown Railway used 2-2-0 in 1834 including &quot;Hibernia&quot; designed by Richard Roberts and built by Sharp, Roberts and Company, and &quot;Vauxhall&quot; built George Forrester and Company.

===Russia===
The first Russian-built steam locomotive was a 2-2-0 built by the Cherepanovs (father and son) in 1833-1834.

==Decline of the 2-2-0==
By 1840 the 2-2-0 tender type had largely been superseded by the 2-2-2 configuration. However, there are a few examples of later tank engines, thus William Bridges Adams of the Fairfield Locomotive Works () in Bow supplied a 2-2-0 well tank to the Roman Railway in 1850. Also Dugald Drummond of the London and South Western Railway introduced his C14 class 2-2-0T in 1906, for Auto trains, but this design was not successful and several of the locomotives were rebuilt to 0-4-0.

<doc id="1090668" wikidata="Q1538336" url="?curid=1090668" title="Norinco">
<text>China North Industries Group Corporation Limited, doing business internationally as Norinco Group (an abbreviation of &quot;North Industries Corporation&quot;), and known within China as China Ordnance Industries Group Corporation Limited (), is a Chinese state-owned defense corporation that manufactures commercial and military products. Norinco Group is one of the world&#x27;s largest defense contractors.

The company&#x27;s subsidiary, China North Industries Corporation (), or simply Norinco, markets Norinco Group&#x27;s products internationally, and is also involved in domestic civil construction and military defense projects.

Some of Norinco&#x27;s international customers include Pakistan, Zimbabwe, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it negotiated arms-for-minerals deals, as well as Venezuela.

==History==
Established in 1980 with the approval of the State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Norinco is an enterprise group engaged in both products and capital operation, integrated with research and development, manufacturing, marketing and services. Norinco mainly deals with defense products, petroleum and mineral resources development, international engineering contracting, optronic products, civilian explosives and chemical products, sporting arms and equipment, vehicles and logistics operation.

===U.S. sanctions===

In 1993, the import of most Norinco firearms and ammunition into the United States was blocked under new trade rules when China&#x27;s permanent normal trade relations status was renewed. The prohibition did not apply to sporting shotguns or shotgun ammunition, however. In 1994, U.S. Customs agents conducted a sting operation named Operation Dragon Fire against Atlanta-based importers of Norinco firearms as well as Poly Technologies. Seven officials were arrested after agreeing to smuggle 2,000 fully automatic Chinese-made variants of AK-47s to undercover agents the officials believed may have been connected to the American Mafia. At least one official, Hammond Ku, attempted to sell Chinese-produced tanks and rocket launchers to the undercover agents.

In August 2003, the Bush administration imposed sanctions on Norinco for allegedly selling missile-related goods to Iran. These sanctions led to a prohibition on imports into the US of the remaining types of firearms and ammunition not covered by the 1993 ban.

In November 2020, Donald Trump issued an executive order prohibiting any American company or individual from owning shares in companies that the United States Department of Defense has listed as having links to the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which included Norinco Group. In June 2021, Joe Biden issued Executive Order 14032 expanding the scope of the national emergency declared in order 13959.

===Russian invasion of Ukraine===

In March 2023, &quot;Politico&quot; reported that Norinco shipped assault rifles, drone parts, and body armor to Russia between June and December 2022.

=== Israel–Hamas war ===

Media reports indicate that Hamas has thousands of Norinco-made assault rifles used in the war.

<doc id="1090673" wikidata="Q1122274" url="?curid=1090673" title="Whiz Kids (TV series)">
<text>Whiz Kids is an American science fiction adventure television series that originally aired on CBS from October 5, 1983, to June 2, 1984. The show was created by Philip DeGuere, who had also created the detective series &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; for CBS in 1981, and Bob Shayne and produced by Universal Television. DeGuere also served as executive producer.

The series starred Matthew Laborteaux, Todd Porter, Jeffrey Jacquet and Andrea Elson as the titular “whiz kids”, a group of teenagers who became amateur detectives using computer technology to solve mysteries. The show also starred Max Gail as an investigative reporter and A Martinez as the commanding officer of the local police precinct&#x27;s detective squad.

Although the series experienced a notable backlash from critics for its portrayal of teenage computer hackers, the program garnered four Youth in Film Award nominations for its young stars, as well as a fifth nomination as &quot;Best New Television Series&quot; of 1983.

CBS cancelled &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; after one season, with 18 episodes produced.

==Production==

===Conception===
Philip DeGuere stated in several 1983 interviews he conceived &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; after recognizing the importance of computers in his work as a television producer and believed the &quot;new&quot; technology could make an interesting premise for a series. Prior to the series&#x27; premiere in October 1983, the premise of teenage computer geniuses hacking into other computers was often compared to, and thought to have been inspired by, that of the film &quot;WarGames&quot;, which had been released in May 1983 and became a hit during that summer. However, DeGuere repeatedly stated that his idea for the show was originally conceived in 1981 and was subsequently validated when &quot;Time&quot; magazine named the computer its 1982 &quot;Man of the Year.&quot;

Although DeGuere maintained he originated the series idea in 1981, Bob Shayne revealed in an early 2020 podcast interview that the original concept of the show was his &quot;Hardy Boys done right&quot; idea and was pitched to Universal Television in late 1982, with DeGuere adding the computer aspects as well as the series title in the pitch meeting. The series was intended to be shopped to ABC and NBC to compete with CBS&#x27;s news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and appeal to a juvenile audience.

The go-ahead was given to write a script and begin developing a pilot before this had even been shopped to a network. CBS unexpectedly picked up the show and in January 1983, commissioned a $2 million pilot which DeGuere and Shayne delivered three months later. CBS was impressed and greenlit the series, announcing it at the May upfronts. When explaining the decision to build the show around high school-age characters, DeGuere stated, &quot;We specifically cast them at an age where it would be fun to watch them grow. [...] If the show clicks, we&#x27;ll follow them right through college.&quot;

===Development===
In an attempt to keep the innovative premise plausible, DeGuere hired technical advisors and a computer analyst to supervise and provide input on the stories. When describing the cutting-edge technology that would be depicted on the show, DeGuere stated, &quot;We will be technically accurate without being boring. [...] &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; is a benign futuristic environment, a year or two ahead of actual computer development. [...] Essentially, the stories are human-centered with every precaution being taken not to allow the computer to take on capabilities beyond the realm of reality, which would spoil the integrity of the stories.&quot;

In June 1983, four months prior to the series premiere on CBS, the pilot sparked controversy after it was screened for critics, affiliates, and advertisers at a Phoenix press conference. In response to criticism from advertisers, station owners, and critics, CBS executives had several meetings with the program&#x27;s producers over the summer to emphasize that storylines should be changed so that access to other computers would be portrayed as being obtained &quot;through legal means.&quot; As a result, small changes were made to the original pilot, and two additional adult characters were written into all subsequent episodes: a police detective and a newspaper reporter. These two served to provide the teens with a moral compass as well as access to what would otherwise be considered &quot;classified&quot; information. Specific plotlines were also developed to show the consequences of illegal activities.

==Premise==

Richie Adler (Matthew Laborteaux) is a tenth-grader who lives with his mother, Irene (Madelyn Cain) and younger sister, Cheryl (Melanie Gaffin). His parents are divorced, and his father works overseas as a telecommunications engineer to several firms. Richie is an advanced computer user and receives most of his equipment from his father, who acquires obsolete equipment that is scheduled to be scrapped. Richie collects this equipment and assembles it to form &quot;Ralf&quot;, his pet name for his computer system. Ralf has multiple components and capabilities, including a camera that produces a facial identification system.

Richie and his teenage friends, Hamilton &quot;Ham&quot; Parker (Todd Porter), Jeremy Saldino (Jeffrey Jacquet) and Alice Tyler (Andrea Elson) routinely encounter mysteries which they attempt to solve using Richie&#x27;s computer skills and Ralf&#x27;s power, often tapping into other computer systems, corporate, governmental and private. The cases often involve money-hungry criminals working inside business corporations or government. Guidance is provided by Llewellen Farley (Max Gail), a reporter for the fictional newspaper the &quot;LA Gazette&quot;, whose stories are often exposés of crime and corruption. Farley has a cantankerous but mutually beneficial relationship with Lieutenant Neal Quinn (A Martinez) who is head of the local detective unit.

In most episodes, the three groups — the police (mostly led by Quinn), the media (usually Farley), and the Whiz Kids — all contribute to cracking a case and in bringing the criminals to justice. Their relationship is often conflicted, as Quinn must keep Farley from getting too much insider information, while Farley and Quinn both attempt to keep the teens out of danger. However, each case is never solved by one group alone, and they are all usually forced by circumstance to work together, each drawing from their own particular strengths and fields of expertise.

==Broadcast==
In June 1983, CBS network executives were reportedly planning for &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; to air in a Saturday night timeslot on their schedule. By August, CBS had reconsidered this and instead had the series targeted as its Wednesday night leadoff program when it was slated to premiere in the fall. However, Philip DeGuere had expressed concerns about a September premiere competing with late-season baseball and was instead advocating for a late October premiere. In mid-September, the decision was made to delay the planned premiere by one week. &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; premiered on CBS on Wednesday, October 5, 1983, at 8:00 PM Eastern, facing off against the hit action drama &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; on ABC and the popular reality show &quot;Real People&quot; on NBC. At midseason, with its ratings faltering, &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; was moved from Wednesdays to Saturdays to replace the medical drama &quot;Cutter to Houston&quot;, which had been cancelled after poor ratings for its seven episodes. The first episode after the move aired on Saturday, January 7, 1984.

Keeping the same 8:00 PM time slot it had on Wednesday, &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; now had competition from two other series aimed at younger viewers, since NBC counterprogrammed the hour with the popular sitcoms &quot;Diff’rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;. Those two series managed to keep the younger audience that CBS was targeting with the move, and the show also performed poorly against ABC&#x27;s crime drama &quot;T. J. Hooker&quot; in the same timeslot.

After the fifth episode in the new timeslot aired on February 4, 1984, CBS removed &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; from the regular programming lineup, a move that effectively cancelled the series. The remaining five episodes were burned off randomly over the next four months, with the eighteenth and last airing on June 2, 1984.

===International syndication===
After its cancellation, Universal offered reruns of &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; to local stations in the United States for a number of years to air as part of their weekend schedules.

The series was broadcast in the United Kingdom by ITV, and began on 10 March 1984 in a Saturday teatime slot, except for TVS who broadcast the series on a later date and UTV which broadcast the series in a Sunday teatime slot. The series was concluded on 14 July 1984. &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; screened in New Zealand on TVNZ in 1984. In Japan, it was broadcast by NHK called &quot;Maikon Daisakusen&quot; (マイコン大作戦, meaning &quot;Microcomputer&#x27;s big operations&quot;) in 1984.

In Finland, the series was broadcast on Mainos-TV (MTV3) under the title &quot;Tietokonejengi&quot; (&quot;Computer Gang&quot;) in 1984.

In France, the series was broadcast on Antenne 2 (now France 2) under the title &quot;Les Petits Génies&quot; (&quot;The Little Geniuses&quot;) from April 1 until June 24, 1984. In Quebec, it was broadcast on TVA network in 1985.

In Germany, the series was broadcast on RTL Plus under the title &quot;Computer Kids&quot; from January until April 1989.

In Italy, the series was broadcast on Italia 1 under the title &quot;I Ragazzi del Computer&quot; (&quot;The Computer Guys&quot;) from 1985 until 1990.

In Argentina, the series was broadcast on ATC (now TV Pública) a year after its premiere in USA, under the title &quot;La Pandilla de la Computadora (The Computer Gang)&quot;.

==Technology==
Ralf itself (or &#x27;himself&#x27; as Richie&#x27;s friends call it) is a conglomeration of different machines and special effects work. In Episode 11, Richie complains that a potential Ralf-substitute does not have a disk drive, 48k, interrupts, or error correction, implying Ralf has at least these. In Episode 17, Richie mentions that Ralf it&#x27;s &quot;a 64k homebrewed computer&quot;. A collection of 5.25 inch floppy disks can be seen in several episodes. Ralf also has a modem. The pilot shows Ralf as having a digital camera and a bitmapped color graphics display. Ralf&#x27;s speech synthesis capabilities are also displayed in several episodes. Prior to the premiere episode, DeGuere described the technology behind Ralf&#x27;s speech capabilities, saying &quot;Ralf has a Votrax voice synthesizer chip. When it &#x27;talks&#x27;, it&#x27;s really a computer, not an actor&#x27;s voice that viewers will hear.&quot;

Activities engaged in by the teenagers on the series include wardialing, editing hexadecimal machine code in a hex editor, brute force password cracking, denial-of-service attacks, facial recognition, speech recognition and speech synthesis, image enhancement, social engineering, and even computer dating.

The series prominently features a variety of computer equipment from the 1970s and 1980s that act as props in the show. Some of these machines include, a Gavilan portable computer, a Heath Hero robot kit, an Apple II, an Apple IIe, a Dynalogic Hyperion, an IMSAI PCS 80/30, an Enigma Machine, Commodore PET (in a classroom of the kids&#x27; school), an IBM 3279 terminal painted in black (pilot episode), and a TRS-80 Model 100.

Several pioneer companies of the personal computer industry were listed in the credits as providing technical support. Some are still around (as of 2010) but many have disappeared. They include, Apple Computer, Autodesk, Bytec Comterm, Computer Components Unlimited, Commodore Business Machines, Heath/Zenith Data Systems, CTT Data Systems, Heath Co., Dale Wilson / Code Right, GRiD Systems Corporation, Hitachi America, Interlisp, Microbot, Magnavox, Mattel Electronics, Photonics Technology, RadioShack, Action Computer Enterprise, Televideo Systems, Atari home computer division (makers of Atari 8-bit computers), Paul Lutus, Proton Corporation, Tycom Corporation, Office Systems by Xerox Corp and Xerox Electro-Optical Company.

==Music==
While electronic musical pieces make up most of the background music for the show, a number of riffs are based on classical music. The main theme is an arrangement of the first movement of Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto #21 in C Major, and excerpts play throughout the series. Rossini&#x27;s overture from the &quot;Barber of Seville&quot; is also used repeatedly. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &#x27;Love Theme&#x27; from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is used in one episode to cue Richie&#x27;s romantic involvements.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
The pilot received mixed to negative reviews, with most critics acknowledging that younger viewers would probably like the show, but expressing concern regarding the example(s) set for them. &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic Marilynn Preson wrote, &quot;Mostly it will be children and teens and young adults who may come to love this series [and] that&#x27;s a big part of the problem. [...] These cute kids illegally access and search their school&#x27;s computer, the private files of the county clerk&#x27;s office and the computer system of a large newspaper in Los Angeles. [...] Instead of appealing, the first episode pilot of &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; is appalling.&quot;

&quot;New York Times&quot; critic John J. O&#x27;Connor felt similarly, writing &quot;&quot;Whiz Kids&quot; is a kiddie show, the kind of product that should be shown on Saturday mornings or late afternoons. Richie and his friends are constantly hopping on and off their bicycles as, with the help of a local newspaper reporter, they set about solving rather far-fetched mysteries. Using such computer devices as &quot;image recognition program,&quot; they &quot;access&quot; programs ranging from school schedules to the Southern California Title and Survey Commission. [CBS] is insisting that &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; will be all fun and games and that it will not give youngsters any questionable ideas. Coming on the heels of the recent movie &quot;WarGames&quot;, that remains to be seen.&quot;

&quot;Associated Press&quot; critic Fred Rothenberg echoed the sentiment, writing &quot;&quot;Whiz Kids&quot; does not make a whimper on the sex-and-violence scale, yet it may be more dangerous to children than anything on television this season. [O]ur adolescent heroes – sort of Hardy Boys high on silicon chips – engage, willy-nilly, in assorted illegal activities: computer tampering, driving without licenses and grave-robbing. Even though some of this law-breaking may be construed as adolescent pranks, and all of it is done in the name of crime-fighting, none of it serves well as TV role model behavior.&quot;

&quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; critic Barbara Holsopple perceived the same problems, writing &quot;The season&#x27;s most disturbing new series debuts tonight. Before the hour is through, &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; glorifies theft by computer, breaking and entering, and car theft by underage drivers. [...] Yes, the young actors are talented and clever and cute, [but] &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; glorifies crime. It makes heroes of its young criminals. premise is rooted in the message that anybody&#x27;s computer system is fair game so long as the end justifies the means. And with an 8 P.M. time slot and a cast of young people, its target audience is children.&quot;

&quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; writer Mike Boone gave the series premiere its one positive review, writing &quot;To enjoy &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; – and I think a lot of people will – viewers will have to suspend disbelief and buy the show&#x27;s rather far-out premise. [...] The &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; are a likeable bunch, even when they are casually invading data banks to access private information. Although it was a murder story, the debut episode was admirably devoid of real violence. And viewers of all ages who are intrigued by computers are going to love watching Ralf do his stuff. When you consider the types of TV programs aimed at young viewers in recent seasons, &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; represents a giant leap forward in intelligence and sophistication. It is one of the better shows of the new season.&quot;

In an interview published in the February 1984 issue of &quot;Starlog&quot;, series co-creator and executive producer Philip DeGuere responded to the controversies and criticism leveled at the show, stating &quot;My show has received a great deal of criticism which has offended me. [...] We are dealing with minors and, therefore, are subject to forms of criticism which are not applied to features or other series not dealing with minors. Some people think that a teenager-who-does-something is a much more potent role model for teenagers than an adult. I don&#x27;t agree, I don&#x27;t think a teenager will be more influenced by Matthew Broderick in &quot;WarGames&quot; than Tom Selleck in &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, or Dustin Hoffman in &quot;Tootsie&quot;.&quot;

===Teen reception===
Despite the reception from adult critics, the series established its young stars, particularly Matthew Laborteaux and Todd Porter, as popular teen idols of the mid-1980s, with pinups and articles appearing in numerous teen magazines, including &quot;16 magazine&quot;, &quot;Bop&quot; and &quot;Teen Beat&quot;, among others. While Laborteaux had already garnered notoriety among teen audiences for his role as Albert Ingalls on the NBC family frontier drama, &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;, &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; launched Porter as a new fixture in the various teen magazines of the era. Prompted by reader response to the 15-year-old, in the spring of 1984 &quot;Teen Beat&quot; reported of Porter&#x27;s newfound popularity, writing &quot;With the success of &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;, [Porter&#x27;s] life as an average American kid is over. Now, he&#x27;s going to have to deal with the problems and bonuses of being a genuine teen heartthrob.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Related media==
On October 27, 1983, &quot;Ralf&quot; and the teenage &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; made a crossover appearance on DeGuere&#x27;s other executive produced detective series, &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;. In the episode, entitled &quot;Fly the Alibi Skies&quot;, the adolescent crime-solvers use Ralf to assist the Simon brothers in capturing a murderer by hacking into a computer network linked to San Diego International Airport. This &quot;special appearance&quot; by the teenage stars followed the preceding night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;, entitled &quot;Deadly Access&quot; in which Jameson Parker made a crossover appearance as his &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot; character, A.J. Simon.

&quot;Whiz Kids&quot; is frequently seen on Mexican television throughout the second season of the HBO series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;.

==DVD release==
The show has been released on DVD in France with EAN 3348467301948. The release contains only 13 of the 18 episodes: 1-9 and 11–14. The conversion to PAL was poorly done and there is a lot of frame blending and chroma flickering. Both French and the original English audio are included except on episodes 8, 9, and 11 from disk 3 which have only French audio. The opening credits have been retitled in French.

To date, the show has not been released in the United States, and there are currently no plans to do so.

<text>Phillip Hugh Norman Rudd (born Phillip Hugh Norman Witschke Rudzevecuis, 19 May 1954) is an Australian drummer, best known as the drummer of AC/DC across three stints (1975–1983, 1994–2015, 2018–present). On the 1977 departure of bass guitarist Mark Evans from AC/DC, Rudd became the only Australian-born member of the band. In 2003, he entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with the other members of AC/DC. In 2014, Rudd released his first solo album, &quot;Head Job&quot;. Due to ongoing legal problems in New Zealand, where he is a resident, Rudd was unable to join the band for the 2015 Rock or Bust World Tour and was replaced by Chris Slade. On 30 September 2020, AC/DC confirmed that Rudd would be rejoining the band for their comeback album &quot;Power Up&quot;.

==Career==
===AC/DC===
In 1974 Rudd was told about AC/DC&#x27;s rhythm section auditions by his former Coloured Balls bandmate Trevor Young (no relation to AC/DC&#x27;s Young brothers). Rudd asked Buster Brown bassist Geordie Leach to accompany him to the auditions, but Leach refused due to other commitments. Rudd auditioned and was hired immediately. Rudd&#x27;s drumming style suited the band&#x27;s style of music and became an integral part of AC/DC&#x27;s sound from 1975 to 1983. The band relocated to the United Kingdom in 1976 and followed a heavy schedule of international touring and recording.

A letter written by AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott to his sister Valerie during the 1978 &quot;Powerage&quot; tour claims Rudd suffered “a bit of a nervous breakdown &amp; had to spend a lot of time with a shrink. It was really bad but luckily he got over it quickly enough not to upset the band. We had to treat him with kid gloves for a bit but he&#x27;s ok now.” The letter was later purchased at an auction by the Western Australian government in 2019, which intended to display the letter at the State Library of Western Australia.

===First dismissal from AC/DC and hiatus from music===
AC/DC vocalist Bon Scott died in 1980, an event that left close friend Rudd deeply saddened. He eventually parted ways with the band in 1983 following the recording of the &quot;Flick of the Switch&quot; album. The split was partly the result of his own personal problems as well as a conflict with the band&#x27;s rhythm guitarist and founder Malcolm Young, which allegedly escalated to become physical. Rudd had completed his contributions to the album, and although session drummer B.J. Wilson was recruited to help complete the recording, Wilson&#x27;s drum parts were ultimately not used. Simon Wright was later hired as Rudd&#x27;s permanent replacement, and featured in the music videos released to promote the album.

After his firing, Rudd retired to Tauranga, New Zealand where he purchased a helicopter company. Rudd&#x27;s departure from AC/DC didn&#x27;t become widely known until the eve of their US and Canada tour in 1983. In the last few pages of &quot;Circus Magazine&quot;&#x27;s October 1983 edition it stated &quot;Phil Rudd exits AC/DC [...] to spend more time with his family and his cars&quot;. Rudd married a New Zealander, Lisa O&#x27;Brien, in 1983. Guitarist Angus Young was quoted in the same article as saying &quot;We&#x27;re a rowdy bunch, but we don&#x27;t fight with each other&quot;. Vocalist Brian Johnson added in a &quot;Hit Parader&quot; interview from the same period that &quot;You couldn&#x27;t find a more solid person or drummer than Phil Rudd. None of us would have to work if we didn&#x27;t want to [...] Phil chose that option&quot;.

On his years away from AC/DC, Rudd has said, &quot;I raced cars, flew helicopters, became a farmer and planted some crops. I lived in New Zealand which was great; nice and quiet with nobody bothering me.&quot; Rudd also continued to play drums, &quot;when I wanted to rather than when I had to&quot;, and built his own recording studio.

===Return to AC/DC (1994–2015)===
When AC/DC toured New Zealand in 1991 in support of their &quot;Razors Edge&quot; album, they called Rudd to see if he would be interested in joining them for a casual jam session. Rudd accepted their offer. Though there was no discussion of him rejoining the group at the time, Rudd was invited to permanently rejoin AC/DC in 1994 following the recording of the &quot;Big Gun&quot; single for the &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; movie soundtrack.

AC/DC welcomed Rudd back after Chris Slade&#x27;s term as the band&#x27;s drummer. The band praised Slade for his performance and technical ability, but maintained that a certain groove had been missing from AC/DC&#x27;s music since Rudd&#x27;s departure in 1983. After rejoining the band, he performed on five AC/DC studio albums, &quot;Ballbreaker&quot;, &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, &quot;Black Ice&quot;, &quot;Rock or Bust&quot; and &quot;Power Up&quot;, with &quot;Black Ice&quot; being the band&#x27;s biggest hit on the charts since &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You&quot; in 1981.

Due to legal problems culminating in his house arrest, Rudd was replaced by former AC/DC drummer Chris Slade for the band&#x27;s 2015–2016 Rock or Bust tour.

In September 2020, AC/DC posted a photo on social media listing the band&#x27;s new lineup, including Rudd on drums, as well as a photo featuring him, Angus, Brian Johnson, Cliff Williams and Stevie Young reunited.

===&quot;Head Job&quot; European tour (2017)===
Rudd&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Head Job&quot;, was released on 29 August 2014. New Zealand musicians Allan Badger (bass guitar and vocals) and Geoffrey Martin (guitar) performed on the album alongside Rudd.

Rudd started a tour of Europe in 2017 with the Phil Rudd Band that included Badger, Martin with British bass guitarist John Proctor and New Zealand guitarist Mike &quot;Mutt&quot; Furness. The tour began in Oslo, Norway on 31 March 2017 and visited Sweden, Finland, the UK, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. The latter part of the tour was rescheduled for 2018 and then cancelled.

===&quot;Power Up&quot; and AC/DC return (2018–present)===
It was officially confirmed on 30 September 2020 that Rudd had rejoined AC/DC, after two years of rumours that he, along with fellow band mates Brian Johnson and Cliff Williams, would be returning. However, Rudd sat out of the band’s 2023 performance at Power Trip as well as their subsequent Power Up Tour in 2024. It was later revealed that Rudd’s absence from these performances was a result of him opting to stay home with his partner, who is currently battling stage four breast cancer. His role was filled in on the tour by American drummer Matt Laug.

==Personal life==
Born on 19 May 1954 in Melbourne, Rudd came from a German and Irish background; his stepfather was Lithuanian. He began playing drums in his teens and became serious about pursuing a career in music. He played in several bands in Melbourne before joining Buster Brown with future Rose Tattoo vocalist Angry Anderson. They went on to release one album, &quot;Something To Say&quot;, in 1974, before Rudd left to join the Coloured Balls with Lobby Loyde.

Rudd married New Zealander Lisa O&#x27;Brien in 1983. They have five children. The pair separated in 2006.

===Drug conviction and appeal===
On 1 December 2010, Rudd was convicted of possessing 25 g of marijuana on his boat in Tauranga, New Zealand, but later had his cannabis conviction quashed on the grounds that it would have stopped him from continuing to tour with AC/DC.

===Restaurant===
On 30 July 2011, it was announced that Rudd had purchased and would open a marina restaurant at Bridge Marina in Tauranga, where he resides. He named it &quot;Phil&#x27;s Place&quot;, and planned to sell seafood and steak. The restaurant closed temporarily in July 2012, and reopened on 10 April 2013. In 2014, Rudd was ordered to pay more than $70,000 to three former employees for unjustified dismissal. On 5 May 2019, Phil&#x27;s Place changed ownership, and was renamed &quot;Salinity Restaurant and Bar&quot;.

===Death threats and drug charges===
On 6 November 2014, Rudd was arrested and charged with attempting to procure a murder, threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, following a police raid on his home. The charge of attempting to procure a murder was withdrawn the following day. On 21 April 2015, he pleaded guilty to the remaining charges, with the exception of one of the two threatening to kill charges, which was dropped.

His ongoing legal problems led to the recruitment of AC/DC&#x27;s former drummer Chris Slade in time for the band&#x27;s Rock or Bust World Tour. In an interview on 13 November 2014, Angus Young had stated that AC/DC had experienced problems with Rudd earlier in the year when recording &quot;Rock or Bust&quot;, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots. Young said, &quot;He&#x27;s got to sort himself out I think... At this point it&#x27;s kind of a question mark. But if we&#x27;re touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way.&quot; In the same interview, Young also said, &quot;Phil created his own situation. It&#x27;s a hard thing to say about the guy. He&#x27;s a great drummer, and he&#x27;s done a lot of stuff for us. But he seems to have let himself go. He&#x27;s not the Phil we&#x27;ve known from the past.&quot; In May 2015, Rudd stated that he hoped to return, but said that he had no contact from the band, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re having a great old time... I&#x27;ve seen the error of my ways... It&#x27;s onward and upward from here.&quot;

On 9 July 2015, Rudd was sentenced to eight months&#x27; home detention and ordered to pay NZ$120,000 in reparation. His appeal to be discharged without conviction was rejected. A subsequent appeal of the sentence to the High Court was dismissed. In a 2016 interview, Rudd said that since completing his home detention that March, he was seeing a psychiatrist weekly and had given up the &quot;crazy shit&quot;. He also revealed he planned to tour Europe to promote his album &quot;Head Job&quot;.

In November 2023, Rudd announced the sale of his personal memorabilia, including drum kits and drumsticks from renowned performances, to support the New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation. Motivated by his partner Toni Wilson&#x27;s fight against terminal stage 4 breast cancer, Rudd&#x27;s initiative aimed to raise funds and awareness for the disease.

<doc id="1090680" wikidata="Q6027914" url="?curid=1090680" title="Industrial manslaughter">
<text>Industrial manslaughter, for example in Australian Capital Territory law, is a crime where the action or inaction of an employer results in the death of an employee. Industrial manslaughter usually has a much broader scope than standard criminal manslaughter.

Industrial manslaughter legislation is a common demand of trade unions, to allow the criminal prosecution of owners and employers for workplace deaths.

==Implementation==
The Australian Capital Territory has provisions for industrial manslaughter introduced in 2004. ACT Crimes Act 1900 (A1900-40) R32 13 July 2004 p44

In 2017, industrial manslaughter became an offence in Queensland in their workplace health and safety legislation, the &quot;Work Health and Safety Act 2011&quot;.

Despite the offence existing in four jurisdictions as of 2020, there have been no successful prosecutions.

In New South Wales on the 16th of September 2024, the crime of Industrial Manslaughter came into effect following the passage of the Work Health and Safety Amendment (Industrial Manslaughter) Act 2024 earlier that year.

==Demands for Industrial manslaughter in NSW==
In New South Wales provisions for industrial manslaughter were demanded by the trade union movement after the adolescent building industry worker Joel Exter fell off a domestic roof and died. Joel&#x27;s union, the CFMEU conducted a significant campaign around his death. The Labor Party (ALP) government of NSW under Bob Carr denied that industrial manslaughter provisions were necessary as Workcover already has provisions for dealing with industrial death. The trade union movement argued that the manslaughter provisions of Workcover were ineffective, as reflected by a lack of prosecution of employers for workplace death.

===Party positions on Industrial Manslaughter===
The NSW Liberal Party does not believe specific industrial manslaughter provisions to be necessary.

The NSW section of the Australian Greens believes that industrial manslaughter should be a federal crime.

== Victoria Passes Workplace Manslaughter Legislation ==
The Victorian Parliament passed the Workplace Safety Legislation Amendment (Workplace Manslaughter and other matters) Bill 2019 on 26 November 2019 and is expected to come into effect on a day to be proclaimed or, at the latest, 1 July 2020.

<doc id="1090690" wikidata="Q461394" url="?curid=1090690" title="List of images on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band">
<text>The Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; has a widely recognized album cover that depicts several dozen celebrities and other images. The image was made by posing the Beatles in front of life-sized, black-and-white photographs pasted onto hardboard and hand-tinted.

== Concept ==
The cover image was created by Jann Haworth and Peter Blake, who in 1967 won the Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, Graphic Arts, for their work on it. Blake has said that the intention was to show a new band surrounded by fans after a performance. In an interview with &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, he said:

I suggested that they had just played a concert in the park. They were posing for a photograph and the crowd behind them was a crowd of fans who had been at the concert. Having decided on this, then, by making cut-outs, the fans could be anybody, dead or alive, real or fictitious. If we wanted Hansel and Gretel, I could paint them and they could be photographed and blown up. I asked the four Beatles for a list and I did one myself. Robert Fraser did a list and I can&#x27;t remember whether Brian Epstein did one or not. The way that worked out was fascinating. John gave me a list and so did Paul. George suggested only Indian gurus, about six of them, and Ringo said, &quot;Whatever the others say is fine by me&quot; and didn&#x27;t suggest anyone. It&#x27;s an insight into their characters. All kinds of people were suggested. Hitler was there; he is actually in the set-up, but he is covered by the Beatles themselves as we felt he was too controversial. The same applied to Jesus. There were only two of their contemporaries on the cover. Bob Dylan was suggested by John and I put on Dion because he is a great favourite of mine.

== Excluded and obscured people ==
*(12) Leo Gorcey – was modelled and originally included to the left of Huntz Hall, but he was subsequently removed when a fee of $400 ($3,755 in 2024) was requested for the use of the actor&#x27;s likeness.
*(45C) Adolf Hitler – was requested by Lennon and modelled behind the band (to the right of Larry Bell), but was moved out of frame (being &quot;too controversial&quot;, according to Blake) and replaced by Johnny Weissmuller. Blake uniquely insists that Hitler was hidden behind the band during the final shoot.
*(54A) Unidentified laughing figure – barely visible
*(56A) Sophia Loren (actress) – behind the Beatles&#x27; waxworks
*(58A) Marcello Mastroianni (actor) – behind the Beatles&#x27; waxworks, only the top of the hat is slightly visible
*(65B) Timothy Carey (actor) – was modelled and originally included but largely obscured by George Harrison in the final picture
*(68) Mahatma Gandhi – was modelled and originally included to the right of Lewis Carroll, but was subsequently removed. According to McCartney, &quot;Gandhi also had to go because the head of EMI, Sir Joe Lockwood, said that in India they wouldn&#x27;t allow the record to be printed&quot;.
*Jesus Christ – was requested by Lennon, but he was not modelled because the LP would be released just over a year after Lennon&#x27;s controversial statement that the band was &quot;more popular than Jesus&quot;.

<doc id="1090691" wikidata="Q1951101" url="?curid=1090691" title="Standing on a Beach">
<text>Standing on a Beach (titled Staring at the Sea in CD format in some countries) is a greatest hits album by English rock band the Cure, released in the United States on 15 May 1986 by Elektra Records and in the United Kingdom on 19 May 1986 by Fiction Records, marking a decade since the band&#x27;s founding in 1976. The album&#x27;s titles are both taken from the opening lyrics of the Cure&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Killing an Arab&quot;.

The &quot;New Voice – New Mix&quot; of &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; (released as a single little over a fortnight before &quot;Standing on a Beach&quot;) was not included on the album; thus the album&#x27;s singles span only from 1978 to 1985.

&quot;A Forest&quot; on this compilation is the album version (which was also on the 12-inch single) but with the first 59 seconds removed. It is not the 7-inch single edit (which removes a few bars between verses and fades out part way through the guitar solo ending).

The album was critically acclaimed. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it &quot;one of the finest albums of the &#x27;80s&quot;.

==Release formats==
The album was released on vinyl record, compact disc, audio cassette.

The vinyl edition is a collection of all 13 of the Cure&#x27;s commercially released singles up to that point in chronological order. &quot;10:15 Saturday Night&quot; was dropped though, possibly because it was only released in France.

The CD edition features the same tracks as the vinyl edition, but also includes an extra track from four of the band&#x27;s albums. The four songs, although not released as singles, all had music videos made for them.

The cassette edition features the same tracks as the vinyl edition, but also contains all of the band&#x27;s B-sides that had not, to that point, received a long-play release. This excludes &quot;10:15 Saturday Night&quot; from the &quot;Killing an Arab&quot; single, which was released on the &quot;Three Imaginary Boys&quot; album, &quot;Plastic Passion&quot; from the &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; single, which was released on the &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot; album, and the five B-sides from the &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Bed&quot;, &quot;The Walk&quot; and &quot;The Love Cats&quot; singles, which were released on the &quot;Japanese Whispers&quot; compilation album. However, the B-side &quot;Mr. Pink Eyes&quot; from the 12-inch version of &quot;The Lovecats&quot; was omitted from &quot;Japanese Whispers&quot;, and so was included on this release.

These releases were accompanied by a video release, a music video collection titled &quot;Staring at the Sea: The Images&quot; with the same setlist as the CD version of the album. This was released on Betamax and VHS videocassettes, laser disc (US and Japan only), Video CD (China only) and VHD (Japan only).

All the B-sides on the cassette edition were also later released on the first disc of the &quot;Join the Dots&quot; compilation in 2004.

The album has been certified 2× platinum in the US.

==Album art==
The man featured on the album cover was not a member of the Cure; he was chosen because his appearance fit the desired aesthetic of the album. His name is John Button, and was at the time a retired fisherman. He also appeared in the music video for &quot;Killing an Arab&quot;. According to the band&#x27;s 2005 biography by Jeff Apter, when asked why he agreed to lend his face to the band&#x27;s media, Button&#x27;s answer was, &quot;If I can help these youngsters break through, after all, why not?&quot; He also reportedly said that he would buy a record player and listen to one of the band&#x27;s songs &quot;out of curiosity, just to see&quot;.

<text>The Norwegian campaign (8 April 10 June 1940) involved the attempt by Allied forces to defend northern Norway coupled with the resistance of the Norwegian military to the country&#x27;s invasion by Nazi Germany in World War II.

Planned as Operation Wilfred and Plan R 4, while the German attack was feared but had not yet happened, the battlecruiser set out from Scapa Flow for Vestfjorden with twelve destroyers on 4 April. The Royal Navy and the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; met at the first and second naval battles of Narvik on 10 and 13 April, and British forces conducted the Åndalsnes landings on 13 April. The main strategic reason for Germany to invade Norway was to seize the port of Narvik and guarantee the delivery of iron ore needed for German steel production.

The campaign was fought until 10 June 1940 and saw the escape of King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav to the United Kingdom. A British, French and Polish expeditionary force of 38,000 troops landed in the north. It had moderate success but made a rapid strategic retreat after the Battle of France began on 14 May. The Norwegian government then went into exile in London. The campaign ended with the occupation of the entirety of Norway by Germany but elements of the Norwegian military escaped and fought on overseas.

==Background==

===Outbreak of the Second World War===
Britain and France had signed military assistance treaties with Poland and two days after the German Invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, both declared war on Nazi Germany. However, neither country mounted significant offensive operations and for several months there were no major engagements, and this period became known as the Phoney War or &quot;Twilight War&quot;. Winston Churchill in particular wished to escalate the war into a more active phase, in contrast to Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.

During this time both sides wished to open secondary fronts. For the Allies, in particular the French, this was based on a desire to avoid repeating the trench warfare of the First World War, which had occurred on the Franco-German border.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, the Norwegian government had mobilized parts of the Norwegian Army and all but two of the Royal Norwegian Navy&#x27;s warships. The Norwegian Army Air Service and the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service were also called up to protect Norwegian neutrality from violations by the warring countries. The first such violations were the sinkings in Norwegian territorial waters of several British ships by German U-boats. In the following months, aircraft from all the belligerents violated Norwegian neutrality.

Almost immediately after the outbreak of war, the British began pressuring the Norwegian government to provide them with the services of the Norwegian merchant navy, being in dire need of shipping to oppose the strength of Nazi forces. Following protracted negotiations between 25 September and 20 November 1939, the Norwegians agreed to charter 150 tankers, as well as other ships with a tonnage of 450,000 gross tons. The Norwegian government&#x27;s concern for the country&#x27;s supply lines played an important role in persuading them to accept the agreement.

===Value of Norway===
Norway, although neutral, was considered strategically important for both sides for several reasons. First was the importance of iron ore from Sweden – upon which Germany depended – exported through the Norwegian port of Narvik. This route was especially important in the winter months when much of the Baltic Sea was frozen over. Narvik became of greater significance to the British when it became apparent that Operation Catherine, a plan to gain control of the Baltic Sea, would not be realized. &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Erich Raeder had pointed out several times in 1939 the danger to Germany of Britain seizing the initiative and launching its own invasion in Scandinavia, for if the powerful Royal Navy had bases at Bergen, Narvik and Trondheim, the North Sea would be virtually closed to Germany, and the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; would be at risk even in the Baltic.

Controlling Norway would also be a strategic asset in the Battle of the Atlantic. The capture of ports would create gaps in the blockade of Germany, giving access to the Atlantic Ocean. These ports would allow Germany to use its sea power effectively against the Allies. Control of Norwegian air bases would allow German reconnaissance aircraft to operate far into the North Atlantic, while German U-boats and surface ships operating out of Norwegian naval bases would be able to break the British blockade line across the North Sea and attack convoys heading to Great Britain.

===Winter War===

When the Soviet Union launched its attack against Finland on 30 November 1939, the Allies found themselves aligned with Norway and Sweden in support of Finland against the much larger aggressor.

After the outbreak of the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Norway mobilized larger land forces than what had initially been considered necessary. By early 1940 their 6th Division in Finnmark and Troms fielded 9,500 troops to defend against a potential Soviet attack, positioned mostly in the eastern regions of Finnmark. Parts of the 6th Division&#x27;s forces remained in Finnmark even after the German invasion, guarding against the danger. During the Winter War, the Norwegian authorities secretly broke the country&#x27;s own neutrality by sending the Finns a shipment of 12 Ehrhardt 7.5 cm Model 1901 artillery pieces and 12,000 shells, as well as allowing the British to use Norwegian territory to transfer aircraft and other weaponry to Finland.

This presented an opportunity to the Allies; offering them the potential to use the invasion to also send troop support to occupy ore fields in Sweden and ports in Norway. The plan, promoted by the British General Edmund Ironside, included two divisions landing at Narvik, five battalions somewhere in mid-Norway, and another two divisions at Trondheim. The French government pushed for action to be taken to confront the Germans away from France.

These developments concerned the Germans. The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact had placed Finland within the Soviet sphere of interest, and the Germans therefore claimed neutrality in the conflict. This policy caused a rise in anti-German sentiment throughout Scandinavia, since it was commonly believed that the Germans were allied with the Soviets. Fears began to crop up in the German high command that Norway and Sweden would then allow Allied troops to transit their territory to go to Finland&#x27;s aid.

The proposed Allied deployments never occurred, after protests from both Norway and Sweden, when the issue of transfers of troops through their territory was suggested. With the Moscow Peace Treaty on 12 March 1940, the Finland-related Allied plans were dropped. The abandonment of the planned landings put immense French pressure on Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s British government, and eventually led to the Allies laying mines off the Norwegian coast on 8 April.

===Vidkun Quisling and initial German investigation===
The German high command originally thought that having Norway remain neutral was in its interest. As long as the Allies did not enter Norwegian waters, there would be safe passage for merchant vessels transporting ore via Norwegian coastal waters to Germany.

&quot;Großadmiral&quot; Erich Raeder, however, argued for an invasion. He believed that the Norwegian ports would be of crucial importance for Germany in a war with the United Kingdom.

On 14 December 1939, Raeder introduced Adolf Hitler to Vidkun Quisling, a Nasjonal Samling former defence minister of Norway. Quisling proposed pan-Germanic cooperation between Nazi Germany and Norway. In a second meeting on 18 December, Quisling and Hitler discussed the threat of an Allied invasion of Norway.

After the first meeting with Quisling, Hitler ordered the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) to begin investigating possible invasion plans of Norway. Meeting Quisling was central in igniting Hitler&#x27;s interest in bringing the country effectively under his control. The first comprehensive German plan for the occupation of Norway, &quot;Studie Nord&quot;, ordered by Hitler on 14 December, was completed by 10 January 1940. On 27 January, Hitler ordered that a new plan, named &quot;Weserübung&quot;, be developed. Work on &quot;Weserübung&quot; began on 5 February.

===&quot;Altmark&quot; incident===

The &quot;Altmark&quot; incident occurred in the late hours of 16 February 1940 when the Royal Navy destroyer entered Norwegian territorial waters, intercepting and boarding the German auxiliary ship in the Jøssingfjord. &quot;Altmark&quot; had spent the prior months as a fleet oiler turned prison ship for the German cruiser while the latter was acting as a commerce raider in the South Atlantic. When she began the return journey to Germany, she carried 299 prisoners taken from Allied ships sunk by the &quot;Graf Spee&quot;. She rounded Scotland, then entered Norwegian territorial waters near the Trondheimsfjord, flying the Imperial Service Flag (&quot;Reichsdienstflagge&quot;). A Norwegian naval escort accompanied &quot;Altmark&quot; as she proceeded southwards, hugging the Norwegian coastline. As &quot;Altmark&quot; was nearing Bergen harbour on 14 February, the Norwegian naval authorities demanded an inspection of her cargo. International law did not ban the transfer of prisoners of war through neutral waters, and the German captain refused the inspection. This led the commander in Bergen, Admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen, to deny &quot;Altmark&quot; access to the restricted-access harbour zone. Tank-Nielsen was overruled by his superior, Admiral Henry Diesen, and she was escorted through. Per Norwegian neutrality regulations, government ships operated by the warring countries were forbidden from such strategically important Norwegian ports. This violation of the regulations was because Diesen feared that the British would intercept &quot;Altmark&quot; if she was forced to sail further out.

On 16 February, &quot;Altmark&quot; was spotted by three British aircraft. This led the Royal Navy to send one light cruiser and five destroyers that were patrolling nearby. Under the attack of two British destroyers (HMS &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;Intrepid&quot;), &quot;Altmark&quot; fled into the Jøssingfjord. She was escorted by the Norwegian torpedo boat . She was joined later in the fjord by a second – – and the patrol boat &quot;Firern&quot;. As &quot;HMS Cossack&quot; entered the fjord at 22:20 local time, the Norwegian vessels did not intervene when the British boarded &quot;Altmark&quot; in the late hours of 16 February. The boarding action led to the freeing of 299 British prisoners of war held on the German ship. The boarding party fought in hand-to-hand combat with the crew of &quot;Altmark&quot;, killing seven German sailors.

Following this, the Germans sent strong protests to Norway, and the Norwegians sent protests to Britain. While Norwegian, Swedish and American experts in international law claimed the boarding of &quot;Altmark&quot; was a violation of Norwegian neutrality, the British government argued that the incident was at the most a technical violation that had been morally justified. The whole led to the Germans speeding up their plans for an invasion of Norway. On 21 February, General Nikolaus von Falkenhorst was placed in charge of its planning and in command of the land-based forces. The official approval for the invasion and occupation of Denmark and Norway was signed by Hitler on 1 March.

==Initial plans==

===Allied plans===
With the end of the Winter War, the Allies determined that any occupation of Norway or Sweden would likely do more harm than good, possibly driving the neutral countries into an alliance with Germany. However, the new French prime minister, Paul Reynaud, took a more aggressive stance than his predecessor and wanted some form of action taken against Germany. Churchill was a strong agitator for action in Scandinavia because he wanted to cut Germany off from Sweden and push the Scandinavian countries to side with the United Kingdom. This initially involved a 1939 plan to penetrate the Baltic with a naval force. This was soon changed to a plan involving the mining of Norwegian waters to stop iron ore shipments from Narvik and provoke Germany into attacking Norway, where it could be defeated by the Royal Navy.

It was agreed to use Churchill&#x27;s naval mining plan, Operation Wilfred, designed to remove the sanctuary of Norway&#x27;s coastal waterways and force transport ships into international waters, where the Royal Navy could engage and destroy them. Accompanying this would be Plan R 4, an operation where, upon almost certain German counteraction to Operation Wilfred, the Allies would then proceed to occupy Narvik, Trondheim, Bergen, and Stavanger. The planners hoped that the operation would not provoke the Norwegians to resist the Allies with armed force.

The Allies disagreed over the additional Operation Royal Marine, where mines would also be placed in the Rhine River. While the British supported this operation, the French vetoed it for three months since they also depended on the Rhine and feared German air raids on their aircraft and munitions factories. Because of this delay, Operation Wilfred, originally scheduled for 5 April, was delayed until 8 April when the British agreed to undertake the Norwegian operations separately from those on the continent.

===German plans===

Already in low-priority planning for months, Operation Weserübung found a new sense of urgency after the &quot;Altmark&quot; incident. The goals of the invasion were to secure the port of Narvik and the costal waterways for ore transport, and to control the country to prevent collaboration with the Allies. It was to be presented as an armed protection of Norway&#x27;s neutrality.

One subject debated by German strategists was the occupation of Denmark. Denmark was considered vital because its location facilitated greater air and naval control of the area. While some wanted to simply pressure Denmark to acquiesce, it was eventually determined that it would be safer for the operation if Denmark were captured by force.

Another matter that caused additional reworking of the plan was &quot;Fall Gelb&quot;, the proposed invasion of northern France and the Low Countries, which would require the bulk of German forces. Because some forces were needed for both invasions, &quot;Weserübung&quot; could not occur at the same time as &quot;Gelb&quot;, and because the nights, which provided vital cover for the naval forces, were shortening as spring approached, it therefore had to be sooner. Eventually, on 2 April, the Germans set 9 April as the day of the invasion (&quot;Wesertag&quot;), and 04:15 (Norwegian time) as the hour of the landings (&quot;Weserzeit&quot;).

In Norway, the German plan called for the capture of six primary targets by amphibious landings: Oslo, Kristiansand, Egersund, Bergen, Trondheim and Narvik. Additionally, supporting &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratroops) were to capture other key locations, such as airfields at Fornebu outside Oslo and Sola outside Stavanger. The plan was designed to quickly overwhelm the Norwegian defenders and occupy these vital areas before any form of organized resistance could be mounted. The following forces were thus organized:
* &quot;Gruppe 1&quot;: Ten destroyers transporting 2,000 &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot; troops commanded by General Eduard Dietl to Narvik
* &quot;Gruppe 2&quot;: The heavy cruiser and four destroyers to Trondheim
* &quot;Gruppe 3&quot;: The light cruisers and , with several smaller support vessels to Bergen
* &quot;Gruppe 4&quot;: The light cruiser and several smaller support vessels to Kristiansand
* &quot;Gruppe 5&quot;: The heavy cruisers and , the light cruiser and several smaller support vessels to Oslo
* &quot;Gruppe 6&quot;: Four minesweepers to Egersund

Additionally, the battleships and would escort &quot;Gruppe 1&quot; and &quot;Gruppe 2&quot; as they travelled together, and there would also be several echelons of transports carrying additional troops, fuel and equipment.

Against Denmark, two motorized brigades would capture bridges and troops; paratroops would capture Aalborg airfield in the north, and heavy fighters of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; would destroy the Danish aircraft on the ground. While there were also several naval task groups organized for this invasion, none of them had any large ships. Unescorted troopships would transport soldiers to capture the Danish High Command in Copenhagen. The following German naval forces used to invade Denmark were as organized:
* &quot;Gruppe 7&quot;: , two transports, two minesweepers and six trawlers to land one regiment at Korsør and a company at Nyborg.
* &quot;Gruppe 8&quot;: One minelayer, an icebreaker and two patrol boats to land one battalion at Copenhagen.
* &quot;Gruppe 9&quot;: One freighter, two tugboats and seven minesweepers to land one company at Middlefart and Fredericia.
* &quot;Gruppe 10&quot;: One escort sloop and 20 minesweepers to land two companies from the 170th Infantry Division at Esbjerg.
* &quot;Gruppe 11&quot;: One minesweeper depot ship and 14 minesweepers to land a company from the 170th Infantry Division at Thyborøn.

The Germans hoped they could avoid armed confrontation with the residents of both countries, and their troops were instructed to fire only if fired upon.

==Opposing forces==
===German===
The German forces used in the campaign were some 120,000 troops in seven divisions and one &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; battalion, as well as panzer and artillery units. Most of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;&#x27;s major units were also earmarked for the campaign. The Luftwaffe&#x27;s 10th Air Corps deployed against Norway consisted of 1,000 aircraft, including 500 transport planes and 186 Heinkel He 111 bombers.

===Norwegian and Allied===
The Norwegian Armed Forces fielded around 55,000 combatants involved in the fighting, including 19,000 soldiers, mainly in six infantry divisions. The Norwegian Army had around 60,000 trained soldiers, with 3,750 troops per regiment. However, by the Germans&#x27; speed and surprise, only 52,000 ever saw combat. The Allied expeditionary force numbered around 38,000 men.

==German invasion==
===Fleet movements===
The German invasion began on 3 April 1940, when covert supply vessels began to head out in advance of the main force. The Allies initiated their plans on the following day, with 16 Allied submarines ordered to the Skagerrak and Kattegat to serve as a screen and give advance warning of a German response to Operation Wilfred, which was launched the following day when Rear-Admiral William Whitworth, Rear-Admiral Commanding, Battlecruiser Squadron, in set out from Scapa Flow for the Vestfjorden with twelve destroyers.

On 7 April, bad weather began to develop in the region, blanketing the area with thick fog and causing rough seas, making travel difficult. &quot;Renown&quot;″s force was soon caught in a heavy snowstorm, and , one of the destroyer escorts, had to drop out of formation to search for a man swept overboard. The weather aided the Germans, providing a screen for their forces, and in the early morning they sent out &quot;Gruppe 1&quot; and &quot;Gruppe 2&quot;, which had the longest distance to travel.

Although the weather did make reconnaissance difficult, the two German groups were discovered south of the Naze (the southernmost part of Norway) slightly after 08:00 by Royal Air Force (RAF) patrols and reported as one cruiser and six destroyers. A trailing squad of bombers sent out to attack the German ships found them farther north than they had been before. No damage was inflicted by the attack, but the German group&#x27;s strength was reassessed as being one battlecruiser, two cruisers and ten destroyers. Because of a strict enforcement of radio silence, the bombers were not able to report this until 17:30.

On learning of the German movement, the Admiralty came to the conclusion that the Germans were attempting to break the blockade that the Allies had placed on Germany and use their fleet to disrupt Atlantic trade routes. Admiral Sir Charles Forbes, Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Fleet, was notified of this and set out to intercept them at 20:15.

With both sides unaware of the magnitude of the situation, they proceeded as planned. &quot;Renown&quot; arrived at the Vestfjord late that night and maintained position near the entrance while the minelaying destroyers proceeded to their task. Meanwhile, the Germans launched the remainder of their invasion force. The first direct contact between the two sides occurred the next morning without either side&#x27;s intention.

&quot;Glowworm&quot;, on her way to rejoin &quot;Renown&quot;, happened to come up behind and then in the heavy fog around 08:00 on 8 April. Immediately a skirmish broke out and the German destroyers fled, signalling for help. The request was soon answered by &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, which quickly crippled &quot;Glowworm&quot;. During the action, &quot;Glowworm&quot; rammed &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;. Significant damage was done to &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;″s starboard side, and &quot;Glowworm&quot; sank. During the fight &quot;Glowworm&quot; had broken radio silence and informed the Admiralty of her situation. She was not able to complete her transmission though, and all the Admiralty knew was that &quot;Glowworm&quot; had been confronted by a large German ship, shots were fired, and contact with the destroyer could not be re-established. In response, the Admiralty ordered &quot;Renown&quot; and her single destroyer escort (the other two had gone to friendly ports for fuel), to abandon her post at the Vestfjord and head to &quot;Glowworm&quot;″s last known location. At 10:45, the remaining eight destroyers of the minelaying force were ordered to join them as well.

On the morning of 8 April, the Polish submarine sank the clandestine German troop transport ship off the southern Norwegian port of Lillesand. Discovered among the wreckage were uniformed German soldiers and military supplies. Though &quot;Orzeł&quot; reported the incident to the Admiralty, they were too concerned by the situation with &quot;Glowworm&quot; and the presumed German breakout to give it much thought and did not pass the information on. Many of the German soldiers from the wreck were rescued by Norwegian fishing boats and the destroyer . On interrogation the survivors disclosed that they were assigned to protect Bergen from the Allies. This information was passed on to Oslo, where the Norwegian Parliament ignored the sinking due to being distracted by the British mining operations off the Norwegian coast.

At 14:00, the Admiralty received word that aerial reconnaissance had located a group of German ships a considerable distance west-northwest of Trondheim, bearing west. This reinforced the notion that the Germans were indeed intending a breakout, and the Home Fleet changed direction from northeast to northwest to again try to intercept. Additionally, Churchill cancelled Plan R 4 and ordered the four cruisers carrying the soldiers and their supplies to disembark their cargo and join the Home Fleet. In fact, the German ships, &quot;Gruppe 2&quot;, were only performing delaying circling manoeuvres to approach their destination of Trondheim at the designated time.

That night, after learning of numerous sightings of German ships south of Norway, Charles Forbes began to doubt the validity of the breakout idea, and he ordered the Home Fleet to head south to the Skagerrak. He also ordered , along with another cruiser and a few destroyers, to head north and join &quot;Renown&quot;.

At 23:00, as Forbes was just learning of the incident with &quot;Orzeł&quot;, &quot;Gruppe 5&quot; was confronted by the Norwegian patrol vessel at the entrance to the Oslofjord. &quot;Pol III&quot; quickly sent an alarm to the coastal batteries on Rauøy (Rauøy island) and opened fire on the torpedo boat with her single gun shortly before colliding with it. &quot;Albatros&quot; and two of her companions responded with anti-aircraft fire, killing the Norwegian captain and setting &quot;Pol III&quot; on fire. &quot;Gruppe 5&quot; continued into the Oslofjord and cleared the outer batteries without incident. Several of the smaller German ships then broke off to capture the bypassed fortifications along with Horten.

This activity did not go unnoticed, and soon reports had reached Oslo, leading to a midnight session of the Norwegian cabinet. At this meeting, the cabinet issued orders for the mobilization of four of the six field brigades of the Norwegian Army. The members of the cabinet failed to understand that the partial mobilization they had ordered would, according to the regulations in place, be carried out in secret and without public declaration. Troops would be issued their mobilization orders by post. The only member of the cabinet with in-depth knowledge of the mobilization system, Defence Minister Birger Ljungberg, failed to explain the procedure to his colleagues. He would later be heavily criticized for this oversight, which led to unnecessary delays in the Norwegian mobilization. Prior to the cabinet meeting, Ljungberg had dismissed repeated demands for a total and immediate mobilization, made by the chief of the general staff, Rasmus Hatledal. Hatledal had approached Ljungberg on 5, 6 and 8 April, asking the defence minister to request the cabinet issue orders for mobilization. The issue had been discussed in the evening of 8 April, after the commanding general, Kristian Laake, had joined the calls for a mobilization. At that time the mobilization had been limited to two field battalions in Østfold, further delaying the larger-scale call-up of troops. When Laake&#x27;s call for mobilization was finally accepted sometime between 03:30 and 04:00 on 9 April, Laake assumed, like Defence Minister Ljungberg, that the cabinet knew that they were issuing a partial and silent mobilization. The poor communication between the Norwegian armed forces and the civilian authorities caused much confusion in the early days of the German invasion.

At about this time, further north, &quot;Renown&quot; was heading back to Vestfjord after reaching &quot;Glowworm&quot;″s last known location and not finding anything. Heavy seas had caused Whitworth to sail further north than normal, and he was separated from his destroyers when he encountered &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;. &quot;Renown&quot; engaged the two battlecruisers off the Lofoten Archipelago, and during the short battle &quot;Renown&quot; scored several hits on the German vessels, forcing them to flee north. &quot;Renown&quot; attempted to pursue, but the German warships used their superior speed to escape.

===&quot;Weserzeit&quot;===
In the Ofotfjord leading to Narvik, the ten German destroyers of &quot;Gruppe 1&quot; made their approach. With &quot;Renown&quot; and her escorts earlier diverted to investigate the &quot;Glowworm&quot; incident, no British ships stood in their way, and they sailed into the area unopposed. By the time they had reached the inner area near Narvik, most of the destroyers had peeled off from the main formation to capture the outer batteries of the Ofotfjord, leaving only three to contend with the two old Norwegian coastal defence ships standing guard in Narvik harbour, and . Although antiquated, the two coastal defence ships were quite capable of taking on the much more lightly armed and armoured destroyers. After a quick parley with the captain of &quot;Eidsvold&quot;, Odd Isaachsen Willoch, the German ships opened fire on the coastal defence ship, sinking her after hitting her with three torpedoes. &quot;Norge&quot; entered into the fray shortly after and began to fire on the destroyers, but her marksmen were inexperienced and she did not hit the Germans ships before being sunk by a salvo of torpedoes from the German destroyers.

Following the sinking of &quot;Eidsvold&quot; and &quot;Norge&quot;, the commander of Narvik, Konrad Sundlo, surrendered the land forces in the town without a fight.

At Trondheim, &quot;Gruppe 2&quot; also faced only minor resistance to their landings. In the Trondheimsfjord, &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; engaged the defensive batteries while her destroyers sped past them at . A well placed shot by &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot; severed the power cables for the searchlights and rendered the guns ineffective. Only one destroyer received a hit during the landing.
At Bergen, the defensive fortifications put up stiffer resistance to &quot;Gruppe 3&quot;&#x27;s approach and the light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot; and the artillery training ship &quot;Bremse&quot; were damaged, the former seriously. The lack of working lights reduced the effectiveness of the guns though, and the landing ships were able to dock without much opposition. The fortifications were surrendered soon after, when Luftwaffe units arrived.

The fortifications at Kristiansand put up an even more resolute fight, twice repulsing the landing and damaging , nearly causing her to run aground. Confusion soon sprung up though, when the Norwegians received the order not to fire on British and French ships and the Germans began to use Norwegian codes that they had captured at Horten. The Germans also used this opportunity to quickly reach the harbour and unload their troops, capturing the town by 11:00.

While most of &quot;Gruppe 4&quot; was engaged at Kristiansand, the torpedo boat captured Arendal without any opposition. The main objective at Arendal was the undersea telegraph cable to the United Kingdom.

&quot;Gruppe 5&quot; encountered the most serious resistance at the inner defensive fortifications of the Oslofjord, in the vicinity of Drøbak. , leading the group, approached the forts assuming that they would be taken by surprise and not respond in time, as had been the case with those in the outer fjord. It was not until the cruiser was at point-blank range that Oscarsborg Fortress opened fire, hitting with every shell. Within a matter of minutes, &quot;Blücher&quot; was crippled and burning heavily. The damaged cruiser was sunk by a salvo of antiquated, 40-year-old torpedoes launched from land-based torpedo tubes. She carried much of the administrative personnel intended both for the occupation of Norway and also for the headquarters of the army division assigned to seize Oslo. The cruiser , also damaged in the attack and believing &quot;Blücher&quot; had entered a minefield, withdrew with &quot;Gruppe 5&quot;, 19 km (12 mi) south to Sonsbukten where she unloaded her troops. This distance delayed the arrival of the main German invasion force for Oslo by over 24 hours, though the Norwegian capital would still be captured less than 12 hours after the loss of &quot;Blücher&quot; by troops flown into Fornebu Airport near the city.
The delay induced by the Norwegian forces gave time for the royal family, Parliament, and with them the national treasury, to flee the capital and continue the fighting against the invasion force.

Fornebu Airport was originally supposed to be secured by paratroops an hour before the first troops were flown in, but the initial force became lost in the fog and did not arrive. Regardless, the airfield was not heavily defended and the German soldiers who did arrive captured it promptly. The Norwegian Army Air Service&#x27;s Jagevingen fighter flight based at Fornebu Airport resisted with their Gloster Gladiator biplane fighters until ammunition ran out and then flew off to whatever secondary airfields were available. The ground personnel of the Fighter Wing soon ran out of ammunition for their anti-aircraft machine guns as well; in the general confusion and focus on readying the fighters for action, no one had the presence of mind or the time to issue small-arms ammunition for the personal weapons of the ground personnel. Resistance at Fornebu Airport came to an end, with the Germans&#x27; only loss being a single Junkers Ju 52. Norwegian attempts to mount a counter-attack were half-hearted and effectively came to nothing. On learning of this, Oslo was declared an open city and soon fully surrendered.

For &quot;Gruppe 6&quot; at Egersund and the paratroops at Stavanger, there was no significant opposition and they quickly captured their objectives.

====Battle of Midtskogen====
This battle, although very small, had saved the Norwegian royal family. As the invasion had begun, the Norwegian Government fled to nearby Hamar. Among them, a group of Norwegian Royal Guardsmen and some soldiers, possibly from the 5th Regiment in nearby Elverum took positions in Midtskogen to try to stop or slow down the Germans so that the Norwegian royal family could evacuate.

In the morning of 10 April, a firefight ended with the retreat of both sides as Captain Spiller, the leader of the German Fallschirmjager, had been hit. Casualties are estimated to five Germans killed and an unknown number wounded, and three Norwegians hit.

====Conquest of Denmark====
The German plans for the invasion and occupation of Norway relied heavily on air power. To secure the Skagerrak strait between Norway and Denmark, the air bases in Denmark had to be seized. The domination of this strait would prevent the Royal Navy from interfering with the main supply lines of the invasion forces. In this respect, the occupation of Denmark was considered to be vital. The capture of Aalborg Airport was considered particularly important in this respect.

The German &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; crossed the Danish border around 05:15 on 9 April. In a coordinated operation, German troops disembarked at the docks of Langelinie in the Danish capital, Copenhagen, and began occupying the city. German paratroops also captured Aalborg Airport. Simultaneously, an ultimatum was presented by the German ambassador to King Christian X. The Danish army was small, ill-prepared and used obsolete equipment, but resisted in several parts of the country; most importantly, the Royal Guards located at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, and forces in the vicinity of Haderslev in South Jutland. By 06:00, the small Danish Air Force had been taken out and 28 German Heinkel He 111 bombers were threatening to drop their bombs over Copenhagen. King Christian, having consulted with Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning, Foreign Minister P. Munch and the commanders of the army and the navy, decided to capitulate, believing that further resistance would only result in a useless loss of Danish lives. By 08:43 Denmark had capitulated. The Danish public was taken completely by surprise by the occupation, and was instructed by the government to cooperate with the German authorities. Germany&#x27;s occupation of Denmark lasted until 5 May 1945.

An important part of the Danish merchant marine escaped the occupation, as Arnold Peter Møller, President of the Mærsk shipping company, on 8 April instructed his ships on the high seas to move to Allied or neutral ports if at all possible.

In a pre-emptive move to prevent a German invasion, British forces occupied the Faroe Islands on 12 April 1940, then a Danish amt (county). The Danish county governor and the Faroese parliament Løgting governed the islands for the duration of the war.

===Allied response===

Soon after this, the German landings at Trondheim, Bergen, and Stavanger, as well as the skirmishes in the Oslofjord became known. Not willing to disperse too thinly due to the unknown location of the two German battleships, the Home Fleet chose to focus on nearby Bergen and dispatched an attack force. RAF reconnaissance soon reported stronger opposition than anticipated, and this, along with the possibility that the Germans might be controlling the shore defences, caused them to recall the force and instead use the aircraft carrier to launch torpedo bombers at the enemy ships. The attack never commenced though, as Luftwaffe bombers launched an assault of their own against the Home Fleet first. This attack sank the destroyer and then forced the Home Fleet to withdraw north when their anti-aircraft measures proved ineffective. This German air superiority in the area led the British to decide that all southern regions had to be left to submarines and the RAF, while surface vessels would concentrate on the north.

In addition to the German landings in south and central Norway, the Admiralty was also informed via press reports that a single German destroyer was in Narvik. In response to this, they ordered the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla, mostly consisting of ships previously serving as escort destroyers for Operation Wilfred, to engage. This flotilla, under the command of Captain Bernard Warburton-Lee, had already detached from &quot;Renown&quot; during her pursuit of &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, being ordered to guard the entrance to the Vestfjord. At 16:00 on 9 April, the flotilla sent an officer ashore in Tranøy Municipality, about west of Narvik and learned from the locals that the German force was 4–6 destroyers and a submarine. Warburton-Lee sent these findings back to the Admiralty, concluding with his intention to attack the next day at &quot;dawn, high water&quot;, which would give him the element of surprise and protection against any mines. This decision was approved by the Admiralty in a telegram that night.

====First Battle of Narvik====
Though ten German destroyers had originally taken Narvik, only five remained in the harbour, with three others moving North and the remaining two going west. Early the following morning, Warburton-Lee led his flagship, , and four other destroyers into the Ofotfjord. At 04:30, he arrived at Narvik harbour and entered along with and , leaving and to guard the entrance and watch the shore batteries. The fog and snow were extremely heavy, allowing Warburton-Lee&#x27;s force to approach undetected. When they arrived at the harbour itself they found five German destroyers and opened fire, starting the First Battle of Narvik. Warburton-Lee&#x27;s ships made three passes on the enemy ships, being joined after the first by &quot;Hotspur&quot; and &quot;Hostile&quot;, and sank two of the destroyers, disabled one more, and sank six tankers and supply ships. The German commander, Commodore Friedrich Bonte, lost his life when his flagship was sunk.

However, Captain Warburton-Lee would make a fatal error when he decided to attack the German destroyers one last time. The German destroyers from the North and West converged on the British Fleet at 06:00, while the British were preparing for the final attack. &quot;Hardy&quot; was severely damaged and beached, and Warburton-Lee was killed. &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Hotspur&quot; were both critically damaged, and &quot;Hotspur&quot; ran into the sinking &quot;Hunter&quot;. &quot;Hostile&quot; and &quot;Havock&quot; meanwhile had raced ahead, but turned about and came back to aid the retreat of &quot;Hotspur&quot;. The German destroyers were low on fuel and ammunition, allowing &quot;Hostile&quot; and &quot;Havock&quot; to come back to aid the retreat of &quot;Hotspur&quot;.

====Second Battle of Narvik====
Shortly after the First Battle of Narvik, two more German ships were sunk by British forces. During the night of 9/10 April, the submarine intercepted and sank the light cruiser &quot;Karlsruhe&quot; shortly after she had left Kristiansand. On 10 April, the Fleet Air Arm made a long-range attack from their base at RNAS Hatston (also called HMS &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;) in the Orkney Islands against German warships in Bergen harbour. The attack sank the disabled German light cruiser &quot;Königsberg&quot;.

On 10 April, &quot;Furious&quot; and the battleship joined the Home Fleet, and another air attack was made against Trondheim hoping to sink &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;. &quot;Admiral Hipper&quot;, however, had already managed to escape through the watch set up outside the port and was on her way back to Germany when the attack was launched; none of the remaining German destroyers or support ships were hit in the assault. Better luck was had in the south when severely damaged the heavy cruiser &quot;Lützow&quot; at midnight on 11 April, putting the German ship out of commission for a year.

With it becoming more evident that the German fleet had slipped out of Norwegian waters, the Home Fleet continued north to Narvik in the hope of catching the remaining destroyers. En route the ships suffered further harassment from German bombers, forcing them to divert to the west away from the shoreline. By 12 April, they were in range of Narvik and an aerial attack on Narvik from &quot;Furious&quot; was attempted, but the results were disappointing. It was instead decided to send in the battleship &quot;Warspite&quot; and a powerful escort force, to be commanded by Whitworth.

On the morning of 13 April, Whitworth&#x27;s force entered the Vestfjord using &quot;Warspite&quot;″s Swordfish floatplane to guide the way. Aside from locating two of the German destroyers, the scouting aircraft also sank the &quot;U-64&quot;, the first submarine kill by an aircraft. &quot;Warspite&quot;″s destroyers travelled in advance of the battleship and were the first to engage their German counterparts which had come to meet them, thus starting the Second Battle of Narvik. Though neither side inflicted notable damage, the German ships were running low on ammunition and were gradually pushed back to the harbour. By that afternoon, most attempted to flee up the Rombaksfjord, the only exception being which beached herself as she made for the Herjangsfjord and was destroyed by . Four British destroyers continued to chase the German ships up through the Rombaksfjord, &quot;Eskimo&quot; was soon damaged by the waiting opposition. However, the German situation was hopeless, having run out of fuel and ammunition, and by the time the remaining British ships arrived, the German crews had abandoned and scuttled their ships. By 18:30 the British ships were making their way out of the now cleared fjord.

==Norwegian situation==
The German invasions for the most part achieved their goal of simultaneous assault and caught the Norwegian forces off guard, a situation not aided by the Norwegian government&#x27;s order for only a partial mobilization. Not all was lost for the Allies though, as the repulsion of the German &quot;Gruppe 5&quot; in the Oslofjord gave a few additional hours of time which the Norwegians used to evacuate the royal family and the Norwegian Government to Hamar. With the government now fugitive, Vidkun Quisling used the opportunity to take control of a radio broadcasting station and announce a coup, with himself as the new Prime Minister of Norway. Quisling&#x27;s coup and his list of new ministers was announced at 19:32. The Quisling coup government remained in place until 15 April, when the Administrative Council was appointed by the Supreme Court of Norway to deal with the civilian administration of the occupied areas of Norway, and Quisling resigned.

In the evening of 9 April, the Norwegian Government moved to Elverum, believing Hamar to be insecure. All German demands were rejected and the Elverum Authorization was passed by the members of the parliament, giving the cabinet wide-ranging powers to make decisions until the next time the Parliament could be assembled under ordinary circumstances. However, the bleakness of the situation prompted them to agree to continued negotiations with the Germans, set for the following day. As a precaution Colonel Otto Ruge, Inspector General of the Norwegian Infantry, set up a roadblock about 110 km (68 mi) north of Oslo, at Midtskogen. The Norwegian position was soon attacked by a small detachment of German troops, led by Eberhard Spiller, the air attaché for the German Embassy, who were racing north in an attempt to capture King Haakon VII. A skirmish broke out and the Germans turned back after Spiller was mortally wounded. On 10 April, the final negotiations between the Norwegians and Germans failed after the Norwegian delegates, led by Haakon VII, refused to accept the German demand for recognition of Quisling&#x27;s new government. The same day, panic broke out in German-occupied Oslo, following rumours of incoming British bombers. In what has since been known as &quot;the panic day&quot; the city&#x27;s population fled to the surrounding countryside, not returning until late the same evening or the next day. Similar rumours led to mass panic in Egersund and other occupied coastal cities. The origins of the rumours have never been uncovered.

On 11 April, the day after the German-Norwegian negotiations had broken down, 19 German bombers attacked Elverum. The two-hour bombing raid left the town centre in ruins and 41 people dead. The same day 11 &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombers also attacked the town of Nybergsund, in an attempt at killing the Norwegian King, Crown Prince Olav and cabinet.

One of the final acts of the Norwegian authorities before dispersement was the promotion on 10 April of Otto Ruge to the rank of major general and appointment to Commanding General of the Norwegian Army, responsible for overseeing the resistance to the German invasion. Ruge replaced the 65-year-old General Kristian Laake as Commanding General, the latter having been heavily criticized for what was considered to be passive behaviour during the initial hours of the invasion. Elements in the Norwegian cabinet considered General Laake to be a defeatist. Following the appointment of Ruge the Norwegian attitude became clear, with orders to stop the German advance being issued. With the Germans in control of the largest cities, ports and airfields, as well as most of the arms depots and communication networks, repulsing them outright would be impossible. Ruge instead decided that his only chance lay in playing for time, stalling the Germans until reinforcements from the United Kingdom and France could arrive.

On 11 April, after receiving reinforcements in Oslo, General Falkenhorst&#x27;s offensive began; its goal was to link up Germany&#x27;s scattered forces before the Norwegians could effectively mobilize or any major Allied intervention could take place. His first task was to secure the Oslofjord area, then to use the 196th and 163rd Infantry Divisions to establish contact with the forces at Trondheim.

==Ground campaign==
When the nature of the German invasion became apparent to the British military, it began to make preparations for a counter-attack. Dissension among the various branches was strong though, as the British Army, after conferring with Otto Ruge, wanted to assault Trondheim in Central Norway while Churchill insisted on reclaiming Narvik. It was decided to send troops to both locations as a compromise. Admiral Lord Cork was in overall command of the Allied operations.

===Campaign in eastern Norway===
After the appointment of Ruge as Commanding General on 10 April, the Norwegian strategy was to fight delaying actions against the Germans advancing northwards from Oslo to link up with the invasion forces at Trondheim. The main aim of the Norwegian effort in eastern Norway was to give the Allies enough time to recapture Trondheim, and start a counter-offensive against the German main force in the Oslo area. The region surrounding the Oslofjord was defended by the 1st Division, commanded by Major General Carl Johan Erichsen. The rest of the region was covered by the 2nd Division, commanded by Major General Jacob Hvinden Haug. Having been prevented from mobilizing in an orderly fashion by the German invasion, improvised Norwegian units were sent into action against the Germans. Several of the units facing the German advance were led by officers especially selected by Ruge to replace commanders who had failed to show sufficient initiative and aggression in the early days of the campaign. The German offensive aimed at linking up their forces in Oslo and Trondheim began on 14 April, with an advance north from Oslo towards the Gudbrandsdalen and Østerdalen valleys. Hønefoss was the first town to fall to the advancing German forces. North of Hønefoss the Germans began meeting Norwegian resistance, first delaying actions and later units fighting organized defensive actions. During intense fighting with heavy casualties on both sides, troops of the Norwegian Infantry Regiment 6 blunted the German advance at the village of Haugsbygd on 15 April. The Germans only broke through the Norwegian lines at Haugsbygd the next day after employing panzers for the first time in Norway. Lacking anti-tank weapons, the Norwegian troops could not hold back the German attack.

The basis for the Norwegian strategy started collapsing already on 13 and 14 April, when the 3,000 troops of the 1st Division in Østfold evacuated across the Swedish border without orders, and were interned by the neutral Swedes. The same day that the 1st Division began crossing into Sweden, the two battalions of Infantry Regiment no. 3 at Heistadmoen Army Camp in Kongsberg capitulated. The 3rd Division, commanded by Major General Einar Liljedahl and tasked with defending southern Norway, surrendered to the Germans in Setesdal on 15 April, having seen no action up to that point. Some 2,000 soldiers marched into captivity in the Setesdal capitulation. With the abandonment on 20 April of the Franco-British plans for recapturing the central Norwegian city of Trondheim, Ruge&#x27;s strategy became practically infeasible.

With the calling off of the Allied plans for recapturing Trondheim, British forces which had been landed at Åndalsnes moved into eastern Norway. By 20 April three British half-battalions had moved as far south as Fåberg, near the town of Lillehammer. The main British units deployed to eastern Norway in April 1940 were the Territorials of the 148th Infantry Brigade and the regular 15th Infantry Brigade. In a series of battles with Norwegian and British forces over the next weeks the Germans pushed northwards from Oslo, their main effort through the Gudbrandsdal valley. Particularly heavy fighting took place in places like Tretten, Fåvang, Vinstra, Kvam, Sjoa and Otta. In the Battle for Kvam on 25 and 26 April, the British managed to delay the German advance for two days of heavy fighting. Other German units broke through the Valdres and Østerdalen valleys, in the former case after heavy fighting and an initially successful Norwegian counterattack.

During their advance northwards from Oslo the Germans regularly broke down Norwegian resistance using air strikes. Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers proved particularly effective in demoralizing Norwegian troops opposing the advance. The Norwegian forces&#x27; almost complete lack of anti-aircraft weapons allowed the German aircraft to operate with near impunity. Likewise, when German panzers were employed the Norwegians had no regular countermeasures. The British No. 263 Squadron RAF fighter squadron set up base on the frozen lake Lesjaskogsvatnet on 24 April to challenge German air supremacy, but many of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were destroyed by German bombing on 25 April. The four Gladiators that survived to be evacuated to Setnesmoen army base near Åndalsnes were out of operation by the end of 26 April. Setnesmoen was bombed and knocked out by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on 29 April.

===Norwegian collapse in southern Norway===
After their capture of Kristiansand on 9 April the battalion-strong German invasion force in southern Norway permitted the evacuation of the civilian population from the city. At the same time the Germans moved to secure the areas surrounding Kristiansand. After several days of confusion and episodes of panic among the Norwegian troops, despite the complete absence of fighting, the 2,000 men of the defending 3rd Division in Setesdal surrendered unconditionally on 15 April.

===Campaign in western Norway===

The important western cities of Bergen and Stavanger were captured by the Germans on 9 April. Some 2,000 German soldiers occupied Bergen and captured the Norwegian arms depots there. The small Norwegian infantry forces in Bergen retreated eastwards, blowing up two railway bridges and sections of road after them. Despite the loss of the cities, the regional commander, General William Steffens, ordered a total mobilization. During mid-April the 6,000-strong Norwegian 4th Division, responsible for the defence of western Norway, was mobilized around the town of Voss in Hordaland. The 4th Division was the only military district outside northern Norway to be mobilized completely and in an orderly fashion. The soldiers of the 4th Division managed to repulse the initial German push along the Bergen Line railway line connecting western and eastern Norway.

After troops of the more northerly 5th Division had covered the British landings at Åndalsnes, Steffens planned an offensive aimed at recapturing Bergen. To achieve this aim the 4th Division had a total mobilized force of 6,361 soldiers and 554 horses. General Steffens&#x27; plans were made redundant when General Ruge on 16 April ordered most of the division&#x27;s forces to be redeployed to Valdres and Hallingdal, to reinforce the main front in eastern Norway. The focus of the remaining forces in western Norway became to prevent the Germans from advancing from the areas around Bergen. Norwegian naval forces, organized into three regional commands by Admiral Tank-Nielsen, prevented German intrusions into Hardangerfjord and Sognefjord. In total the Royal Norwegian Navy fielded some 17–18 warships and five to six aircraft in western Norway following the German capture of Bergen. After the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombed and severely damaged Voss and the surrounding countryside on 23–25 April, inflicting civilian casualties, the Germans captured the town on 26 April.

Following the fall of Voss, General Steffens evacuated the remains of his forces northward, evacuating the south side of the Sognefjord on 28 May (except for a small contingent at Lærdal). He set up his own headquarters at Førde and prepared for the further defence of Sogn og Fjordane. On 30 April a message from General Otto Ruge was communicated, telling of the evacuation of all allied troops and also of the King and Army command, from southern Norway. With no help forthcoming from either allied or Norwegian forces, on 1 May 1940, Steffens ordered his troops to disband. The advancing German forces were informed of the whereabouts of the Norwegian troops, and agreed to let them disband unmolested. On the night between 1 May and 2 May, Steffens left for Tromsø with three naval aircraft, effectively ending the campaign in the region. No allied land troops had been involved in the fighting in Hordaland and Sogn og Fjordane. Another two aircraft flew to the United Kingdom to undergo service. Although the Royal Norwegian Navy&#x27;s ships in western Norway were ordered to evacuate to the United Kingdom or northern Norway, only the auxiliary sailed to the United Kingdom and &quot;Steinar&quot; to northern Norway. The remaining ships were either prevented from leaving due to massive desertions, or had commanders who chose to disband their men rather than risk the voyages to Allied-controlled territory. The last Norwegian forces in western Norway only disbanded in Florø on 18 May 1940.

===Campaign in central Norway===

The original plans for the campaign in Central Norway called for a three pronged attack against Trondheim by Allied forces while the Norwegians contained the German forces to the south. It was called Operation Hammer, and would land Allied troops at Namsos to the north (Mauriceforce), Åndalsnes to the south (Sickleforce), and around Trondheim itself (Hammerforce). This plan was quickly changed though, as it was felt that a direct assault on Trondheim would be far too risky and therefore only the northern and southern forces would be used.

To block the expected allied landings the &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; ordered a &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; company to make a combat drop on the railway junction of Dombås in the north of the Gudbrandsdal valley. The force landed on 14 April and managed to block the rail and road network in Central Norway for five days before being forced to surrender to the Norwegian Army on 19 April.

A British vanguard force arrived at Åndalsnes on 12 April. The main landing of Sickleforce, consisting primarily of the British 148th Infantry Brigade and commanded by Major-General Bernard Paget, occurred on 17 April. The successful Norwegian mobilization in the area opened the opportunity for the British landings.

In the waning hours of 14 April, Mauriceforce, composed primarily of the British 146th Infantry Brigade and commanded by Major-General Adrian Carton de Wiart made their initial landings at the Norwegian port town of Namsos. During the trip the force had been transferred to destroyers instead of bulky transport ships due to the narrow waters of the fjord leading to Namsos; in the confusion of the transfer a great deal of their supplies and even the brigade commander were misplaced. 

Another great problem for Mauriceforce was the lack of air support and effective anti-aircraft defences, something of which the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; took full advantage. On 17 April the force moved forward from Namsos to positions around the village of Follafoss and the town of Steinkjer. French troops arrived at Namsos late on 19 April. On 20 April German aircraft bombed Namsos, destroying most of the houses in the town centre, and large portions of the supply storage for allied troops, leaving de Wiart without a base. Regardless, he moved 130 km (81 mi) inland to Steinkjer and linked up with the Norwegian 5th Division. Constant aerial harassment prevented any kind of offensive from taking place though, and on 21 April Mauriceforce was attacked by the German 181st Division from Trondheim. De Wiart was forced to fall back from these assaults, leaving Steinkjer for the Germans. On 21 and 22 April Steinkjer was bombed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, leaving four-fifths of the town in ruins and more than 2,000 people homeless. By 24 April Steinkjer and the surrounding areas had been occupied by the Germans.

===End of the campaign in Central and South Norway===

By 28 April, with both groups checked by the Germans, the Allied leadership decided to withdraw all British and French forces from the southern and central regions of Norway. The Allied retreat was covered by Norwegian forces, which were then demobilized to avoid having the soldiers taken prisoner by the Germans. On 30 April the Germans advancing from Oslo and Trondheim linked up.

On 28 and 29 April the undefended port town of Kristiansund had been heavily bombed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, as was the nearby port of Molde, which functioned as the headquarters of the Norwegian government and King. The town of Ålesund had also suffered heavily from German bombing during the last days of April.

Sickleforce managed to return to Åndalsnes and escape by 2 May at 02:00, only a few hours before the German 196th Division captured the port. The western Norwegian port had been subjected to heavy German bombing between 23 and 26 April, and had been burning until 27 April. The village of Veblungsnes and the area around Åndalsnes train station suffered particularly heavy damage. By the time the Germans arrived, some 80% of Åndalsnes lay in ruins. Mauriceforce, their convoys delayed by thick fog, were evacuated from Namsos on 2 May, though two of their rescue ships, the French destroyer and the British destroyer were sunk by Junkers Ju 87 dive bombers.

Organized Norwegian military resistance in the central and southern parts of Norway ceased on 5 May, with the capitulation of the forces fighting at Hegra in Sør-Trøndelag and at Vinjesvingen in Telemark.

The failure of the central campaign is considered one of the direct causes of the Norway Debate, which resulted in the resignation of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and the appointment of Winston Churchill to the office.

Having evacuated from Molde during German air attacks on 29 April, King Haakon VII and his government arrived in Tromsø in northern Norway by 1 May. For the remaining weeks of the Norwegian Campaign Tromsø was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Norway, as the headquarters of the King and cabinet.

===Campaign in northern Norway===

In northern Norway the Norwegian 6th division, commanded by General Carl Gustav Fleischer, faced the German invasion forces at Narvik. Following the German invasion General Fleischer assumed the position of commander-in-chief of all Norwegian forces in northern Norway. The Norwegian counter-offensive against the Germans at Narvik was hampered by Fleischer&#x27;s decision to retain significant forces in Eastern Finnmark to guard against a possible Soviet attack in the far north.

Along with the Allied landings at Åndalsnes and Namsos, aimed against Trondheim, further forces were deployed to the north of Norway and assigned the task of recapturing Narvik. Like the campaign in the south, the Narvik expedition faced numerous obstacles.

One of the first problems faced by the Allies was that the command was not unified, or even truly organized. The naval forces in the area were led by Admiral of the Fleet William Boyle, 12th Earl of Cork who had been ordered to rid the area of the Germans as soon as possible. In contrast, the commander of the ground forces, Major-General Pierse Mackesy, was ordered not to land his forces in any area strongly held by the Germans and to avoid damaging populated areas. The two met on 15 April to determine the best course of action. Lord Cork argued for an immediate assault on Narvik and Mackesy countered that such a move would lead to heavy casualties for his attacking troops. Cork eventually conceded to Mackesy&#x27;s viewpoint.

Mackesy&#x27;s force was originally codenamed &quot;Avonforce&quot;, later &quot;Rupertforce&quot;. The force consisted of the 24th Guards Brigade, led by Brigadier William Fraser, and French and Polish units led by Brigadier Antoine Béthouart. The main force began landing at Harstad, a port town on the island of Hinnøya, on 14 April. The first German air attacks on Harstad began on 16 April, but anti-aircraft defences prevented serious damage until a raid on 20 May destroyed oil tanks and civilian houses and another raid on 23 May hit Allied shipping in the harbour.

On 15 April, the Allies scored a significant victory when the Royal Navy destroyers and , which were escorting the troop-carrying Convoy NP1, forced the German U-boat to surface and scuttle in the Vågsfjorden. Found floating around the sinking U-boat were documents detailing the dispositions, codes and operational orders of all U-boats in the Norwegian operational area, providing the Allies with an efficient and valuable tool when planning troop and supply convoys to the campaign in northern Norway.

After the Allied failure in Central Norway, more preparation was given to the northern forces. Air cover was provided by two squadrons of carrier-transported fighters operating from Bardufoss Air Station, the re-equipped No. 263 Squadron RAF with Gloster Gladiators and No. 46 Squadron RAF with Hawker Hurricanes.

As part of the Allied counter-offensive in northern Norway, French forces made an amphibious landing at Bjerkvik on 13 May. The naval gunfire from supporting Allied warships destroyed most of the village and killed 14 civilians before the Germans were dislodged from Bjerkvik.

While the Norwegian and Allied forces were advancing at Narvik, German forces were moving swiftly northwards through Nordland to relieve Dietl&#x27;s besieged troops. The captured Værnes Air Station near Trondheim was rapidly expanded and improved to provide the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; with a base from which to support the Narvik sector. As the German forces moved northwards, they also gained control of the basic facilities at Hattfjelldal Airfield to support their bomber operations.

In late April, ten independent companies had been formed in Britain, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Colin Gubbins. On 2 May, four of these companies were formed into &quot;Scissorsforce&quot;, under Gubbins, and dispatched to forestall the Germans at Bodø, Mo i Rana and Mosjøen. Although they ambushed the leading German units south of Mosjøen they were outmatched by the German main body and were withdrawn to Bodø, which was to be defended by the 24th Guards Brigade.

As the 24th Guards Brigade moved to Bodø, the destroyer , which was carrying Brigadier Fraser, was bombed and was forced to return to Britain. Gubbins, with the acting rank of colonel, assumed command of the brigade. On 15 May the troop ship carrying the 1st Irish Guards was bombed, with heavy casualties to the troops, and two days later the heavy cruiser went aground while carrying much of the equipment of the 2nd South Wales Borderers. Both battalions returned to Harstad to reform and to be re-equipped before setting out again for Bodø.

As the Germans advanced northward from a railhead at Mosjøen, the garrison of Mo i Rana (a mixed force based on the 1st Scots Guards) withdrew on 18 May, too precipitately in Gubbins&#x27;s opinion. The commanding officer of the Scots Guards, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Byrnand Trappes-Lomax, continued to retreat despite orders to hold successive positions which, with the delayed arrival of the rest of the brigade, left Gubbins no time to prepare a defensive position at Storjord. The brigade withdrew under heavy pressure across Skjerstad Fjord on 25 May, covered by a rearguard from the 1st Irish Guards and several of the Independent Companies under Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Stockwell.

In the evening of 27 May Bodø was bombed and strafed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. The bombing raid destroyed the recently constructed improvised airstrip, the radio station and 420 of the town&#x27;s 760 buildings, killing 15 people and leaving a further 5,000 homeless in the process.

Gubbins&#x27;s force was evacuated from Bodø from 30 May to 2 June. During these three days, low cloud prevented the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; interfering. The improvised air strip which had been hit during the 27 May air raid fell into German hands, providing the Germans with an air base much closer to the Narvik fighting, and was of great significance for their continued advance northwards.

On 28 May, two French and one Norwegian battalion attacked and recaptured Narvik from the Germans. To the south of the city Polish troops advanced eastwards along the Beisfjord. Other Norwegian troops were pushing the Germans back towards the Swedish border near Bjørnfjell. However, the German invasion of France and the Low Countries had immensely altered the overall situation of the war and the importance of Norway was considerably lessened. On 25 May, three days before the recapture of Narvik, the Allied commanders had received orders to evacuate from Norway. The attack on the city was in part carried out to mask from the Germans the Allies&#x27; intention of leaving Norway. Shortly after the 28 May Allied recapture of Narvik, the city was bombed and heavily damaged by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

===Allied withdrawal and Norwegian capitulation===

Operation Alphabet, the general Allied retreat from Norway, had been approved on 24 May. Among those who argued against evacuating Norway was Winston Churchill, who later expressed that the decision had been a mistake. The Norwegian authorities were only informed of the decision on 1 June. After a meeting on 7 June at which the decision to carry on the fight abroad was made, King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav and the Norwegian cabinet left Norway on the British cruiser and went into exile in the United Kingdom. Without supplies from the Allies the Norwegian Army would soon have been unable to continue the fight. Both the King and the Crown Prince had considered the possibility of remaining in Norway, but had been persuaded by the British diplomat Cecil Dormer to instead follow the government into exile. The Crown Prince suggested that he should remain and assist the Administrative Council in easing the effects of the occupation, but due to the King&#x27;s old age it was decided that they both had to go into exile, to avoid complications should the King die while abroad. By 8 June, after destroying rail lines and port facilities, all Allied troops had been evacuated. The Germans had launched Operation Juno, sending &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; to relieve pressure on the Narvik garrison. After discovering the evacuation, they shifted the mission to attacking Allied shipping and subsequently sank two British destroyers and the aircraft carrier . Before the British warships were sunk, however, the destroyer torpedoed and damaged &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. Shortly after the encounter, the British submarine intercepted the German ships and torpedoed &quot;Gneisenau&quot;, causing severe damage.

The Norwegian forces on the mainland capitulated to the Germans on 10 June 1940. Units fighting on the front had been ordered to disengage in the early hours of 8 June. Fighting ceased at 24:00 on 9 June. The formal capitulation agreement for forces fighting in mainland Norway was signed at the Britannia Hotel in Trondheim at 17:00 on 10 June 1940. Lieutenant Colonel Ragnvald Roscher Nielsen signed for the Norwegian forces, Colonel Erich Buschenhagen for the German side. A capitulation agreement for the Norwegian forces fighting at Narvik was also signed the same day, at Bjørnfjell. The signatories of this agreement, the last local capitulation of Norwegian troops during the campaign, were General Eduard Dietl for the Germans, and Lieutenant Colonel Harald Wrede Holm for the Norwegians. The 62-day campaign made Norway the country to withstand a German invasion for the longest period of time, aside from the Soviet Union.

==Occupation==
With the capitulation of Norway&#x27;s mainland army a German occupation of the country began. Although the regular Norwegian armed forces in mainland Norway laid down their arms in June 1940, there was a fairly prominent resistance movement, which proved increasingly efficient during the later years of occupation. The resistance to the German occupation began in the autumn of 1940, steadily gaining strength and becoming better organized. Despite the &quot;Gestapo&quot; infiltrating and destroying many of the early organizations, the resistance movement survived and grew. The last year of the war saw an increase in sabotage actions by the exile government-aligned Norwegian resistance organization &quot;Milorg&quot;, although the organization&#x27;s main goal was to retain intact guerilla forces to aid an Allied invasion of Norway. In addition to &quot;Milorg&quot;, many independent, mostly communist, resistance groups operated in occupied Norway, attacking German targets without coordinating with the exiled Norwegian authorities.

The civilian side of the German occupation of Norway was organized through the establishment of the &quot;Reichskommissariat Norwegen&quot;, led from 24 April by Josef Terboven. The Germans attempted to make the exiled Norwegian authorities irrelevant, especially targeting the King. Weeks after the end of the Norwegian Campaign the Germans pressured the presidency of the Norwegian parliament to issue a request that Haakon VII abdicate. On 3 July Haakon VII turned down the request, and on 8 July gave a speech on BBC Radio proclaiming his answer. &quot;The King&#x27;s No&quot;, as it became known, encouraged resistance to the occupation and the Norwegian collaborators. The Administrative Council, appointed by the Norwegian Supreme Court on 15 April to stand in for the Norwegian government in the occupied territories, functioned until 25 September. After that date the Norwegian partner of the occupying Germans was the fascist Quisling regime, in one form or another.

The Royal Norwegian Navy and Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) were re-established in Britain – based on the remnants of forces saved from the Norwegian Campaign. The forces soon saw extensive combat in the convoy-battles of the North Atlantic and in the air-war over Europe. The ranks of the Navy and Air Force were swollen by a steady trickle of refugees making their way out of occupied Norway, and their equipment brought up to standard by British and American aircraft and ships. From a force of 15 ships in June 1940, the Royal Norwegian Navy had expanded to 58 warships by the end of the Second World War in Europe. The ships were manned by around 7,000 crew members. In all 118 warships had been under Norwegian command at one time or another during the war years.

Norwegian squadrons flew with the RAF Fighter and Coastal Commands. The Norwegian-manned 331 Squadron and 332 Squadron operated Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft. The naval 330 Squadron and 333 Squadron flew Northrop N-3PB patrol bombers, Consolidated PBY Catalina and Short Sunderland flying boats and de Havilland Mosquito fighter bombers. Individual Norwegians flew with British air units. In November 1944 the Royal Norwegian Naval Air Service and the Norwegian Army Air Service, having been under a unified command since March 1941, were amalgamated to form the RNoAF. At the end of the war some 2,700 personnel served in the RNoAF.

A c. 4,000 strong Norwegian Army was also re-established in Scotland. However, with the exception of a small number of special forces, it saw little action for the rest of the war. A reinforced company from the Scotland-based Norwegian Army participated in the liberation of Finnmark during the winter of 1944–45. Finnmark and the northern parts of Troms county had been forcibly evacuated by the Germans in a scorched earth operation following the Petsamo–Kirkenes Offensive by the Red Army against occupied Finnmark in October 1944. The offensive had captured the north-eastern town of Kirkenes from the occupying German forces. After the arrival of the 300 troops from Scotland, further troops were moved in from Sweden and mobilized locally. At the end of the war, the Norwegian forces in Finnmark totalled 3,000. In the course of this operation, there were some minor skirmishes with German rear guards and patrols.

In neutral Sweden there was also a Norwegian build-up of forces in the last two years of the war through the so-called &quot;police troops&quot; established with the support of Swedish authorities. The term &quot;police&quot; served as a cover up for what in reality was pure military training of a force mustering around 13,000 well trained and equipped troops by VE-day. In 1945 around 1,300 &quot;police troops&quot; took part in the Liberation of Finnmark.

Aside from the regular Norwegian forces, the main armed resistance movement in Norway, the exile government-controlled &quot;Milorg&quot;, fielded some 40,000 combatants at the end of the war. In November 1941 &quot;Milorg&quot; had been declared by the exiled Norwegian government to be the fourth branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces.

==Casualties and material losses==

===German===

The official German casualties for the Norwegian Campaign totalled 5,296. Of these 1,317 were killed on land, while 2,375 were lost at sea. 1,604 were listed as wounded.

The German losses at sea were heavy, with the sinking of one of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;&#x27;s two heavy cruisers, two of its six light cruisers, 10 of its 20 destroyers and six U-boats. With several more ships severely damaged, the German surface fleet had only three cruisers and four destroyers operational in the aftermath of the Norwegian Campaign. Two torpedo boats and 15 light naval units were also lost during the campaign. Two German battleships and two cruisers were damaged during the campaign.

Official German sources give the number of German aircraft lost during the Norwegian Campaign as 90, with other estimates by historian François Kersaudy ranging as high as 240.

In transport ships and merchant vessels, the Germans lost 21 ships at 111,700 tons, around 10% of what they had available at the time.

===Norwegian and Allied===

The Norwegian and Allied casualties of the Norwegian Campaign totalled around 6,602. The British lost 1,869 killed, wounded and missing on land and approximately 2,500 at sea, while the French and Polish lost 533 killed, wounded and missing. On the Norwegian side there were around 1,700 casualties, of whom 860 were killed. Some 400 Norwegian civilians were also killed, mostly in German bombing raids. Around 60 of the civilians killed were shot by German soldiers during the fighting in eastern Norway, many in summary executions.

On the naval side of the Norwegian casualties, the Royal Norwegian Navy, fielding 121 mostly outdated ships at the outset of the German invasion, was virtually wiped out during the campaign. Only 15 warships, including a captured German fishing trawler, with some 600 men had managed to evacuate to the United Kingdom by the end of the fighting. The remaining Norwegian naval vessels were sunk in action, scuttled by their own crews, or captured by the Germans. Among the warships sunk in action during the campaign were two coastal defence ships and two destroyers. Seven torpedo boats were also sunk or scuttled, while the remaining ten were captured by the Germans. Only one of the nine Norwegian submarines managed to escape to the United Kingdom, the other eight being scuttled or captured. Some 50 captured Norwegian naval ships were over time pressed into service by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

The British lost one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, seven destroyers and a submarine but with their much larger fleet could absorb the losses to a much greater degree than Germany.HMS Vandyck was an Armed Boarding Vessel, she was a reserve ship during the Allied evacuation from Northern Norway in 1940, and was supposed to wait and see if there were any stragglers. Something went wrong with the last radio transmissions and she was left outside Andøya and did not show up when the last convoy left. Shortly afterwards she was found and bombed by FW200 Condor aircraft from KG40 on 10 June.

The French Navy lost the destroyer &quot;Bison&quot; and a submarine during the campaign, and a cruiser severely damaged. The exiled Polish Navy lost the destroyer and the submarine &quot;Orzeł&quot;.

While the British lost 112 aircraft during the campaign, the Norwegians lost all their aircraft except a small number that were successfully evacuated to the United Kingdom or flown to neutral Finland.

The combined total loss of merchants ships and transports for the Allies and Norwegians was around 70 ships.

==Analysis==
The operation as planned was a decisive victory for Germany. Both Denmark and Norway were occupied. Surprise was almost complete, particularly in Denmark.

At sea the invasion proved a temporary setback. For the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; the campaign led to heavy losses, leaving the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; with a surface force of one heavy cruiser, two light cruisers and four destroyers operational. This left the navy weakened during the summer months when Hitler was pursuing plans for an invasion of Britain.

The greatest cost of the campaign on land came in the need to keep most of the invasion troops in Norway for occupation duties away from the fronts. On the whole, the campaign was successful with great benefits for the victor.

Through the Norwegian government&#x27;s Nortraship system, the Allies also gained the services of the Norwegian merchant navy, the fourth largest in the world. The 1,028-ship strong Nortraship was established on 22 April at a government meeting at Stuguflåten in Romsdal. The Nortraship fleet consisted of some 85% of the pre-war Norwegian merchant fleet, the remaining 15% having been in Norway when the Germans invaded and been unable to escape. The Nortraship vessels were crewed by 27,000 sailors. In total 43 free Norwegian ships were sunk during the Norwegian Campaign, while another 29 were interned by the neutral Swedes. Nortraship gave the Norwegian government-in-exile economic independence and a basis for continued resistance from abroad.

The Allies achieved a partial success at Narvik. The Germans had destroyed much of the port facilities there before their loss of the city on 28 May. Shipping from the port was stopped for a period of six months, although the Allies had believed it would be out of operation for a year.

The German occupation of Norway was to prove a thorn in the side of the Allies during the next few years. Bombers based at Sola had a round trip of about 920 km to Rattray Head in north-east Scotland, instead of a round trip of about 1,400 km from the nearest airfield on German soil (the island of Sylt), while the east of Scotland and coastal shipping suffered from bombing raids, most from Norway, until 1943. After the fall of Norway, Scotland (especially the fleet bases at Scapa Flow and Rosyth) were seen as much more vulnerable to a diversionary assault by air- and sea-borne troops. German commerce raiders used Norway as a staging base to reach the North Atlantic. After Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, air bases in Norway were also used to interdict the Allied Arctic convoys there, inflicting painful losses to shipping.

<text>Fred Ott&#x27;s Sneeze (also known as Edison Kinetoscopic Record of a Sneeze) is an 1894 short, black-and-white silent film shot by William K.L. Dickson and featuring Fred Ott. According to the Library of Congress, it is the second oldest surviving U.S. motion picture to be copyrighted, although it is now in the public domain.

In the approximately five-second film, which was shot in January 1894, one of Thomas Edison&#x27;s assistants, Fred Ott, takes a pinch of snuff and sneezes. According to the Library of Congress, the film was &quot;made for publicity purposes, as a series of still photographs to accompany an article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;.&quot; The published &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot; version is slightly longer than what now survives on film, and depicts a second sneeze.

In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Production==
The film was produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company, which had begun making films in 1890 under the direction of Dickson, one of the earliest film pioneers. It was filmed within the Black Maria studio at West Orange, New Jersey, which was the first U.S. movie studio. It was filmed between January 2, 1894, and January 7, 1894 and was displayed, at the time, on Kinetoscope.

== Current status ==

As a film published in the United States before 1978 and more than 95 years ago, its copyright expired and the work is in the public domain in the United States. In countries where copyright expires 70 years after the author&#x27;s death, the copyright of the film expired in 2006. Originally, the film was submitted to the Library of Congress as a &quot;paper print&quot; (a photographic record of each frame of the film) for copyright purposes. A digital copy is now kept by the Library of Congress and can be viewed on their American Memory website. This short film was featured at the 30th Annual Academy Awards, and was included as part of the TV documentary, &quot;The First 100 Years: A Celebration of American Movies&quot;.

<text>Luftwaffen-Legion Lettland was a unit of the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; that served in the Eastern Front in 1944. It was composed almost entirely of Latvian volunteers.

==Unit history==

===Formation and training===
In September 1943 the Germans ordered the creation of a Latvian night bombing unit as part of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. A flight school, &quot;Flugzeugführerschule A/B Libau/Grobin&quot;, was established at Liepāja-Grobina in October, which was renamed &quot;Ergaenzungs Nachtschlachtgruppe Ostland&quot; (&quot;Supplementary Night Combat Group Ostland&quot;) on 1 January 1944. The pilots were drawn from former members of the pre-war Latvian Army&#x27;s Aviation Regiment, the paramilitary &quot;Aizsargi&quot;, and the Latvian Aero Club. Flying training was carried out in the Bücker Bü 131, and ground crews were trained as mechanics, electricians, ordnance handlers, and anti-aircraft gunners.

===&quot;Nachtschlachtgruppe 12 (Lettisch)&quot;===
The first group of pilots graduated in late February, and the 1st &quot;Staffel&quot; (&quot;Squadron&quot;) of &quot;Nachtschlachtgruppe 12 (Lettisch)&quot;, (&quot;12th Night Combat Group (Latvian)&quot;) was established on 1 March 1944. It consisted of all Latvian officer and NCO pilots, ground crews, with a few German liaison and administrative personnel, and was equipped with eighteen Arado Ar 66 biplanes, all under the command of a German, Hauptmann Rademacher.

As a &quot;Störkampfstaffel&quot; (&quot;Harassment squadron&quot;) 1./NSGr.12 flew night bombing missions attacking enemy concentrations, infrastructure, and other targets of opportunity. Although the Ar 66 was a two-seater aircraft, they usually flew with only a single pilot, and carried two or three or anti-personnel or incendiary bombs. Their missions were typically flown at an altitude of around , up to behind enemy lines. Each pilot was issued with a pistol and machine gun, in case of a forced landing in enemy territory.

1./NSGr.12 were first based at Vecumi, flying their first combat missions on 26 March. On 26 May they moved to Salas aerodrome in Kārsava, about south of Vecumi. On 22 June the second &quot;Staffel&quot; (2./NSGr.12) was formed, joining 1./NSGr.12 at Salas on the 26th. In July NSGr.12 moved north-east to Gulbene, and later eastwards to Kalnciems near Riga. A third &quot;Staffel&quot; (3./NSGr.12) was created in July, but due to a lack of aircraft, flew no operations, and its equipment and personnel were eventually incorporated into the 1st and 2nd &quot;Staffeln&quot;.

===Luftwaffen-Legion Lettland===
On 11 August 1944 the &quot;Luftwaffen-Legion Lettland&quot; (&quot;Air Force Legion Latvia&quot;) was formed. It consisted of the two active &quot;Staffel&quot; of NSGr.12, and the third (still in the process of formation), the flight school at Liepāja-Grobina, renamed the &quot;Ergaenzungs Fliegergruppe Lettland&quot; (&quot;Latvian Supplementary Flying Group&quot;), and an anti-aircraft unit. On 17 August overall command of the Legion was assumed by the Latvian Lieutenant-Colonel Jānis Rucels, with Lt.-Col. Nikolajs Bulmanis commanding NSGr.12. In September the Legion was relocated further east to a base in Tukums, and in early October flew their last combat sorties in the vicinity of Dobele. The Legion was finally evacuated back to Hohensalza (now Inowrocław, Poland).

The trust of the Germans in their local Baltic flyers had been eroded by the desertion of five Estonian pilots from &quot;Nachtschlachtgruppe 11 (Estnisch)&quot; to neutral Sweden in late September and early October. As a result, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; ordered that the Estonian and Latvian aviation legions be dissolved. &quot;Luftwaffen-Legion Lettland&quot; was disbanded on 17 October 1944, and its personnel redistributed to German units.

During its operational existence the unit flew about 6,150 sorties, with the loss of six pilots. About 80% of the pilots were awarded the Iron Cross 1st or 2nd class.

In mid-1944 a select group of ten Latvian pilots were transferred to Germany to train in the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Five returned to Latvia in October, but by then the Legion had been disbanded, so they were assigned to &quot;Jagdgeschwader 54&quot;.

<text>Wallace Clement Sabine (June 13, 1868 – January 10, 1919) was an American physicist who founded the field of architectural acoustics. Sabine was the architectural acoustician of Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall, widely considered one of the two or three best concert halls in the world for its acoustics.

== Early life ==
Wallace Clement Sabine was born on June 13, 1868, in Richwood, Ohio, of Dutch, English, French, and Scottish descent. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Ohio State University in 1886 at the age of 18. He then attended Harvard University and graduated with a Master of Arts in 1888.

His sister was Annie W. S. Siebert.

== Career ==
After graduating, Sabine became an assistant professor of physics at Harvard in 1889. He became an instructor in 1890 and a member of the faculty in 1892. In 1895, he became an assistant professor and in 1905, he was promoted to professor of physics. In October 1906, he became dean of the Lawrence Scientific School, succeeding Nathaniel Shaler.
Sabine&#x27;s career is the story of the birth of the field of modern architectural acoustics. In 1895, acoustically improving the Fogg Lecture Hall, part of the recently constructed Fogg Art Museum, was considered an impossible task by the senior staff of the physics department at Harvard. (The original Fogg Museum was designed by Richard Morris Hunt and constructed in 1893. After the completion of the present Fogg Museum the building was repurposed for academic use and renamed Hunt Hall in 1935.) The assignment was passed down until it landed on the shoulders of a young physics professor, Sabine. Although considered a popular lecturer by the students, Sabine had never received his PhD and did not have any particular background dealing with sound.

Sabine tackled the problem by trying to determine what made the Fogg Lecture Hall different from other, acoustically acceptable facilities. In particular, the Sanders Theater was considered acoustically excellent. For the next several years, Sabine and his assistants spent each night moving materials between the two lecture halls and testing the acoustics. On some nights they would borrow hundreds of seat cushions from the Sanders Theater. Using an organ pipe and a stopwatch, Sabine performed thousands of careful measurements (though inaccurate by present standards) of the time required for different frequencies of sounds to decay to inaudibility in the presence of the different materials. He tested reverberation time with several different types of Oriental rugs inside Fogg Lecture Hall, and with various numbers of people occupying its seats, and found that the body of an average person decreased reverberation time by about as much as six seat cushions. Once the measurements were taken and before morning arrived, everything was quickly replaced in both lecture halls, in order to be ready for classes the next day.

Sabine was able to determine, through the experiments, that a definitive relationship exists between the quality of the acoustics, the size of the chamber, and the amount of absorption surface present. He formally defined the reverberation time, which is still the most important characteristic currently in use for gauging the acoustical quality of a room, as number of seconds required for the intensity of the sound to drop from the starting level, by an amount of 60 dB (decibels).

His formula is
:formula_1
where
:T = the reverberation time
:V = the room volume
:A = the effective absorption area

By studying various rooms judged acoustically optimal for their intended uses, Sabine determined that acoustically appropriate concert halls had reverberation times of 2-2.25 seconds (with shorter reverberation times, a music hall seems too &quot;dry&quot; to the listener), while optimal lecture hall acoustics featured reverberation times of slightly under 1 second. Regarding the Fogg Museum lecture room, Sabine noted that a spoken word remained audible for about 5.5 seconds, or about an additional 12-15 words if the speaker continued talking. Listeners thus contended with a very high degree of resonance and echo. Sabine&#x27;s work was continued by his cousin Paul Earls Sabine at the Riverbank Laboratories from 1919.

Using what he discovered, Sabine deployed sound absorbing materials throughout the Fogg Lecture Hall to cut its reverberation time and reduce the &quot;echo effect.&quot; This accomplishment cemented Wallace Sabine&#x27;s career, and led to his hiring as the acoustical consultant for Boston&#x27;s Symphony Hall, the first concert hall to be designed using quantitative acoustics. His acoustic design was successful and Symphony Hall is generally considered one of the best symphony halls in the world.

The unit of sound absorption, the Sabin, was named in his honor.

== Personal life ==
Sabine had a wife and two daughters.

== Death ==
Sabine died on January 11, 1919, at his home in Boston, Massachusetts.

<doc id="1090715" wikidata="Q6371102" url="?curid=1090715" title="Karitane">
<text>The small town of Karitane is located within the limits of the city of Dunedin in New Zealand, 35 kilometres to the north of the city centre.

Set in rolling country near the mouth of the Waikouaiti River, the town is a popular holiday retreat for Dunedinites.

==History==

===Early history===

The site of the present settlement of Karitane includes that of the pre-European Māori kaika, or undefended village. Giant moa were likely to be hunted in the area.

It encompasses Huriawa on the adjacent peninsula, a pā or fortified village, recalled in oral tradition for sieges in the late 17th or early 18th centuries. It was also the site of the whaling station set up by Long, Wright and Richards in 1837. That was known as &quot;Waikouaiti&quot;, but the name later became transferred to the present township of that name established by Johnny Jones as a farming settlement in 1840, on the north side of the estuary.

===Modern history===
In 1838, Jones acquired the Karitane whaling station, primarily targeting southern rights and humpbacks, resulting in severe depletion of local populations for these species. After sending pioneers to start his farming settlement he sent a Wesleyan missionary to join them in May 1840. Rev. James Watkin established the first mission station in the South Island. The first Christian service in the South Island took place in Karitane on 17 May, 1840. Watkin set up his mission station at Karitane. He was living there with his wife and children in a purpose-built house by late 1842. In 1867 George O&#x27;Brien painted a memorable view looking north from the Karitane waterfront, now in the Toitū Otago Settlers Museum, Dunedin.

====2021 lead poisoning scare====

In early February 2021, high levels of lead (40 times the acceptable level of 0.01mg/L) were detected in Karitane and nearby Waikouaiti&#x27;s drinking water. The high levels of lead were first detected on 18 December 2020 but the alert was emailed to a Dunedin City Council staff member who was on holiday. In response, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield offered free blood tests to Karitane and Waikouaiti residents. The Dunedin City Council also dispatched water tanks and staff to assist and reassure local residents. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern described the lead levels in Karitane and Waikouaiti as &quot;unacceptable.&quot; On 9 February, the City Council distributed free fruits and vegetables to residents of Karitane, Waikouaiti, and Hawksbury due to concerns about eating crops irrigated with the contaminated water. On 11 February, the Dunedin City Council also confirmed that it would drain a raw water reservoir and replace 5 kilometres of old pipes in order to reassure local residents. By 10 March, the Southern District Health Board confirmed that 1,512 people had been tested, with blood test results indicating that nobody had a blood lead level requiring hospitalisation and that long term exposure to lead from the water supply was limited.

==Notable people==
===Truby King===

The name &quot;Karitane&quot; is often associated with pioneering paediatrician and psychiatrist Sir Truby King, founder of the Plunket Society. The name is echoed in many New Zealand child-related services and products:
* Plunket set up a string of neonatal care institutions known throughout the country as &quot;Karitane Hospitals&quot;, starting here in Truby King&#x27;s house, &quot;Kingscliff&quot;
* A type of infant formula, &quot;Karicare&quot;, now made by Nutricia, as well as earlier brands &quot;Karilac&quot; and &quot;Kariol&quot; made by the &quot;Karitane Products Society&quot; are named after the town
* &quot;Karitane Nurse&quot; (historically) a type of nurse in New Zealand specialising in infant care
* &quot;Community Karitane&quot;, a type of community worker in New Zealand advising on parenting issues such as breastfeeding, nutrition, sleep and behaviour.
* &quot;Karitane yellow&quot;, an informal name for a (baby-excrement-coloured) unpleasant shade of yellow
* After 40 years absence in the market the Karilac brand has relaunched with a new infant formula called Shegoa which is made from goat and sheep milk.

Truby King also worked at nearby Seacliff Lunatic Asylum.

===Orpheus Beaumont===

Born in Leeds to an English father and a French mother, his family moved to the mountains near Lyon, France, after the Second World War, where he was educated. He studied fine art in Paris, and later worked in an advertising agency in Paris, where he met Serge Danot. Together they made the acclaimed French series &quot;Le Manège enchanté&quot; (known in English as &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;), with Wood as the animator.

Following the success of &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot; in the UK, Wood partnered with the London-based animation company FilmFair. Wood became both animator and director for a number of FilmFair&#x27;s animated children&#x27;s programmes, starting with &quot;The Herbs&quot; in 1968. During the 1970s, he animated and directed &quot;Simon in the Land of Chalk Drawings&quot;, &quot;Hattytown Tales&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Parsley&quot;, &quot;The Wombles&quot;, and &quot;Paddington&quot;.

<doc id="1090739" wikidata="Q3208398" url="?curid=1090739" title="The Dunciad">
<text>The Dunciad () is a landmark, mock-heroic, narrative poem by Alexander Pope published in three different versions at different times from 1728 to 1743. The poem celebrates a goddess, Dulness, and the progress of her chosen agents as they bring decay, imbecility, and tastelessness to the Kingdom of Great Britain.

==Versions==
The first version – the &quot;three-book&quot; &quot;Dunciad&quot; – was published in 1728 anonymously. The second version, the Dunciad Variorum, was published anonymously in 1729. The New Dunciad, in a new fourth book conceived as a sequel to the previous three, appeared in 1742, and The Dunciad in Four Books, a revised version of the original three books and a slightly revised version of the fourth book with revised commentary, was published in 1743 with a new character, Bays, replacing Theobald as the &quot;hero&quot;.

==Origins==
Pope told Joseph Spence (in &quot;Spence&#x27;s Anecdotes&quot;) that he had been working on a general satire of Dulness, with characters of contemporary Grub Street scribblers, for some time and that it was the publication of &quot;Shakespeare Restored&quot; by Lewis Theobald that spurred him to complete the poem and publish it in 1728.

Part of Pope&#x27;s bitter inspiration for the characters in the book comes from his soured relationship with the royal court. The Princess of Wales Caroline of Ansbach, wife of George II, had supported Pope in her patronage of the arts. When she and her husband came to the throne in 1727 she had a much busier schedule and thus had less time for Pope, who saw this oversight as a personal slight against him. When planning the &quot;Dunciad&quot; he based the character Dulness on Queen Caroline, as the fat, lazy and dull wife. The King of the Dunces as the son of Dulness was based on George II. Pope makes his views on the first two Georgian kings very clear in the &quot;Dunciad&quot; when he writes &quot;Still Dunce the second reigns like Dunce the first&quot;.

However, Pope&#x27;s reputation had been impugned, as the full title of Theobald&#x27;s edition was &quot;Shakespeare restored, or, A specimen of the many errors, as well committed, as unamended, by Mr. Pope: in his late edition of this poet. Designed not only to correct the said edition, but to restore the true reading of Shakespeare in all the editions ever yet published.&quot;

Pope had written characters of the various &quot;Dunces&quot; prior to 1728. In his &quot;Essay on Criticism&quot;, Pope describes some critics of a witless nature. In his various &quot;Moral Epistles&quot;, Pope likewise constructs characters of contemporary authors of poor taste. The general structure owes its origins to the communal project of the Scriblerians and other similar works such as the mock-heroic &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot; by John Dryden and Pope&#x27;s own &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;.

The Scriblerian club most consistently comprised Jonathan Swift, John Gay, John Arbuthnot, Robert Harley, and Thomas Parnell. The group met during the spring and summer of 1714. One group project was to write a satire of contemporary abuses in learning of all sorts, in which the authors would combine their efforts to write the biography of the group&#x27;s fictional founder, Martin Scriblerus, through whose writings they would accomplish their satirical aims. The resulting &quot;The Memoirs of Martin Scriblerus&quot; contained a number of parodies of the most lavish mistakes in scholarship.

For the mock-heroic structure of the &quot;Dunciad&quot; itself, however, the idea seems to have come most clearly from &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot;. &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot; is a poem celebrating the apotheosis of Thomas Shadwell, whom Dryden nominates as the dullest poet of the age. Shadwell is the spiritual son of Flecknoe, an obscure Irish poet of low fame, and he takes his place as the favourite of the goddess Dulness.

Pope takes this idea of the personified goddess of Dulness being at war with reason, darkness at war with light, and extends it to a full &quot;Aeneid&quot; parody. His poem celebrates a war, rather than a mere victory, and a process of ignorance, and Pope picks, as his champions of all things insipid, Lewis Theobald (1728 and 1732) and Colley Cibber (1742).

Jean-Pierre de Crousaz, who wrote a biting commentary on Pope&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Man&quot;, found that Pope had &quot;reserved a place for him in the &quot;Dunciad&quot;&quot;.

 Pope first published &quot;The Dunciad&quot; in 1728 in three books, with Lewis Theobald as its &quot;hero&quot;. The poem was not signed, and he used only initials in the text to refer to the various Dunces in the kingdom of Dulness. However, &quot;Keys&quot; immediately came out to identify the figures mentioned in the text, and an Irish pirate edition was printed that filled in the names (sometimes inaccurately). Additionally, the men attacked by Pope also wrote angry denunciations of the poem, attacking Pope&#x27;s poetry and person. Pope endured attacks from, among others, George Duckett, Thomas Burnet, and Richard Blackmore. All of these, however, were less vicious than the attack launched by Edmund Curll, a notoriously unscrupulous publisher, who produced his own pirate copy of the Dunciad with astounding swiftness, and also published &quot;The Popiad&quot; and a number of pamphlets attacking Pope.

In 1729, Pope published an acknowledged edition of the poem, and the &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot; appeared in 1732. The Variorum was substantially the same text as the 1729 edition, but it now had a lengthy prolegomenon. The prefatory material has Pope speaking in his own defence, although under a variety of other names; for example, &quot;A Letter to the Publisher Occasioned by the Present Edition of the Dunciad&quot; is signed by William Cleland (d. 1741), one of Pope&#x27;s friends and father of John Cleland, but it was probably written by Pope himself.

In these prefatory materials, Pope points out that the Keys were often wrong about the allusions, and he explains his reluctance at spelling out the names. He says that he wishes to avoid elevating the targets of the satire by mentioning their names (which, of course, did happen, as a number of persons are only remembered for their appearances in the poem), but he similarly did not want innocents to be mistaken for the targets. Pope also apologises for using parody of the Classics (for his poem imitates both Homer and Virgil) by pointing out that the ancients also used parody to belittle unworthy poets. Pope&#x27;s preface is followed by advertisements from the bookseller, a section called &quot;Testimonies of Authors Concerning Our Poet and his Works&quot; by &quot;Martinus Scriblerus&quot;, and a further section named &quot;Martinus Scriblerus, of the Poem&quot;.

Martinus Scriblerus was a corporate identity employed by Pope and the other members of the Scriblerians. Therefore, these two portions of the preface could have been written by any of its members, but they, like the other prefatory materials, were most likely written by Pope himself. The various Dunces had written responses to Pope after the first publication of &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, and they had not only written against Pope, but had explained why Pope had attacked other writers. In the &quot;Testimonies&quot; section, Martinus Scriblerus culls all the comments the Dunces made &quot;about each other&quot; in their replies and sets them side by side, so that each is condemned by another. He also culls their contradictory characterisations of Pope, so that they seem to all damn and praise the same qualities over and over again.

The &quot;Testimonies&quot; also includes commendations from Pope&#x27;s friends. The words of Edward Young, James Thomson and Jonathan Swift are brought together to praise Pope specifically for being temperate and timely in his charges. The conclusion asks the reader &quot;to chuse whether thou wilt incline to the Testimonies of Authors avowed&quot; (like Pope&#x27;s friends) &quot;or of Authors concealed&quot; (like many of the Dunces) – in short, &quot;of those who knew him, or of those who knew him not&quot;.

===&quot;Tibbald&quot; King of Dunces===
Alexander Pope had a proximal, close and long term cause for choosing Lewis Theobald as the King of Dunces for the first version of the &quot;Dunciad&quot;. The immediate cause was Theobald&#x27;s publication of &quot;Shakespeare Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors as well Committed as Unamended by Mr Pope in his late edition of this poet; designed not only to correct the said Edition, but to restore the true Reading of Shakespeare in all the Editions ever published&quot; in 1726. Pope had published his own version of Shakespeare in 1725, and he had made a number of errors in it. He had &quot;smoothed&quot; some of Shakespeare&#x27;s lines, had chosen readings that eliminated puns (which Pope regarded as low humour), and had, indeed, missed several good readings and preserved some bad ones. In the &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot;, Pope complains that he had put out newspaper advertisements when he was working on Shakespeare, asking for anyone with suggestions to come forward, and that Theobald had hidden all of his material. Indeed, when Pope produced a second edition of his Shakespeare in 1728, he incorporated many of Theobald&#x27;s textual readings.

Pope, however, had already a quarrel with Theobald. The first mention of Theobald in Pope&#x27;s writings is the 1727 &quot;Peri Bathous&quot;, in &quot;Miscellanies, The Last Volume&quot; (which was the third volume), but Pope&#x27;s attack there shows that Theobald was already a figure of fun. Regardless of the quarrels, though, Theobald was, in a sense, the nearly perfect King of Dunces. The &quot;Dunciad&quot;″s action concerns the gradual sublimation of all arts and letters into Dulness by the action of hireling authors. Theobald, as a man who had attempted the stage and failed, plagiarised a play, attempted translation and failed to such a degree that John Dennis referred to him as a &quot;notorious Ideot&quot;, attempted subscription translation and failed to produce, and who had just turned his full attention to political attack writing, was an epitome, for Pope, of all that was wrong with British letters. Additionally, Pope&#x27;s goddess of Dulness begins the poem already controlling state poetry, odes, and political writing, so Theobald as King of Dunces is the man who can lead her to control the stage as well. Theobald&#x27;s writings for John Rich, in particular, are singled out within the &quot;Dunciad&quot; as abominations for their mixing of tragedy and comedy and their &quot;low&quot; pantomime and opera; they are not the first to bring the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings, but they ferried them over in bulk.

===Overview of the three-book &quot;Dunciad&quot;===

The central premise of the poem is the same as that of &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot;: the crowning of a new King of Dulness. However, Pope&#x27;s poem is far more wide-ranging and specific than Dryden&#x27;s had been. His satire is political and cultural in very specific ways. Rather than merely lambasting &quot;vice&quot; and &quot;corruption&quot;, Pope attacks very particular degradations of political discourse and particular degradations of the arts.

The political attack is on the Whigs, and specifically on the Hanoverian Whigs. The poem opens, in fact, with the goddess Dulness noting that &quot;Still Dunce the second rules like Dunce the first&quot;, which is an exceptionally daring reference to George II, who had come to the throne earlier in the year. Furthermore, although the King of Dunces, Theobald, writes for the radical Tory &quot;Mist&#x27;s Journal&quot;, Pope consistently hammers at radical Protestant authors and controversialists. Daniel Defoe is mentioned almost as frequently as anyone in the poem, and the booksellers picked out for abuse both specialised in partisan Whig publications.

The cultural attack is broader than the political one, and it may underlie the whole. Pope attacks, over and over again, those who write for pay. While Samuel Johnson would say, half a century later, that no man but a blockhead ever wrote but for money, Pope&#x27;s attack is not on those who get paid, but those who will write on cue for the highest bid. Pope himself was one of the earliest poets to make his living solely by writing, and so it is not the &quot;professional&quot; author, but the &quot;mercenary&quot; author that Pope derides. He attacks hired pens, the authors who perform poetry or religious writing for the greatest pay alone, who do not believe in what they are doing. As he puts it in book II, &quot;He [a patron] chinks his purse, and takes his seat of state [among the poets] ... And instant, fancy feels th&#x27; imputed sense&quot; (II 189, 192). He objects not to professional writers, but to hackney writers. His dunce booksellers will trick and counterfeit their way to wealth, and his dunce poets will wheedle and flatter anyone for enough money to keep the bills paid.

The plot of the poem is simple. Dulness, the goddess, appears at a Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day in 1724 and notes that her king, Elkannah Settle, has died. She chooses Lewis Theobald as his successor. In honour of his coronation, she holds heroic games. He is then transported to the Temple of Dulness, where he has visions of the future. The poem has a consistent setting and time, as well. Book I covers the night after the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day, Book II the morning to dusk, and Book III the darkest night. Furthermore, the poem begins at the end of the Lord Mayor&#x27;s procession, goes in Book II to the Strand, then to Fleet Street (where booksellers were), down by Bridewell Prison to the River Fleet, then to Ludgate at the end of Book II; in Book III, Dulness goes through Ludgate to the City of London to her temple.

===The arguments of the three books===
====&quot;A&quot; Book I====
The poem begins with an epic invocation, &quot;Books and the Man I sing, the first who brings/ The Smithfield Muses to the Ear of Kings&quot; (I 1–2) (Smithfield being the site of Bartholomew Fair entertainments, and the man in question was Elkanah Settle, who had written for Bartholomew Fair after the Glorious Revolution; Pope makes him the one who brought pantomime, farce, and monster shows to the royal theatres). The goddess Dulness notes that her power is so great that &quot;Time himself stands still at her command, / Realms shift their place, and Ocean turns to land&quot; (I 69-70), and thus claims credit for the routine violation of the Unities of Aristotle in poetry. On Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day of 1724, when Sir George Thorold was Lord Mayor, Dulness announces the death of the current King of Dunces, Elkanah Settle. Settle had been the City Poet, and his job had been to commemorate Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day pageants. Thanks to his hard work in stultifying the senses of the nation, Dulness claims control of all official verse, and all current poets are her subjects (&quot;While pensive Poets painful vigils keep, / Sleepless themselves to give their readers sleep&quot; I 91–92). She mentions Thomas Heywood, Daniel Defoe (for writing political journalism), Ambrose Philips, Nahum Tate, and Sir Richard Blackmore as her darlings. However, her triumph is not complete, and she aspires to control dramatic poetry as well as political, religious, and hack poetry. She therefore decides that Theobald will be the new King.

The action shifts to the library of Lewis Theobald, which is &quot;A Gothic Vatican! of Greece and Rome / Well-purg&#x27;d, and worthy Withers, Quarles, and Blome&quot; (I 125-126) (a Vatican Library for Northern European authors, and especially notable for vainglorious and contentious writing and criticism). Theobald is despairing of succeeding in writing dull poetry and plays, and he is debating whether to return to being a lawyer (for that had been Theobald&#x27;s first trade) or to become a political hack. He decides to give up poetry and become an entirely hired pen for Nathaniel Mist and his &quot;Mist&#x27;s Journal&quot;. He therefore collects all the books of bad poetry in his library along with his own works and makes a virgin sacrifice of them (virgin because no one has ever read them) by setting fire to the pile. The goddess Dulness appears to him in a fog and drops a sheet of &quot;Thule&quot; (a poem by Ambrose Philips that was supposed to be an epic, but which only appeared as a single sheet) on the fire, extinguishing it with the poem&#x27;s perpetually wet ink. Dulness tells Theobald that he is the new King of Dunces and points him to the stage. She shows him,

The book ends with a hail of praise, calling Theobald now the new King Log (from Aesop&#x27;s fable).

====&quot;A&quot; Book II====
Book II centres on the highly scatological &quot;heroic games&quot;. Theobald sits on the throne of Dulness, which is a velveteen tub (&quot;tub&quot; being the common term for the pulpit of Dissenters), and Dulness declares the opening of heroic games to celebrate his coronation. Therefore, all her sons come before her on the Strand in London, leaving half the kingdom depopulated, for she summons both dull writers, their booksellers, &quot;and&quot; all who are stupid enough to patronise dull writers.

The first game is for booksellers. (Booksellers at the time purchased manuscripts from authors, and the proceeds from book sales went entirely to the bookseller, with the author getting no more than the advance price.) Dulness therefore decides upon a race for the booksellers. She creates a phantom Poet,
but, instead, a fat, well dressed poet (and therefore a wealthy, noble one who would command sales by his title). The phantom poet is named More, a reference to James Moore Smythe, who had plagiarised both Arbuthnot (&quot;Historico-physical Account of the South-Sea Bubble&quot;) and Pope (&quot;Memoirs of a Parish Clark&quot;), and whose only original play had been the failed &quot;The Rival Modes&quot;. The booksellers immediately set out running to be the first to grab Moore, with Bernard Lintot setting forth with a roar (Lintot had been James Moore Smythe&#x27;s publisher), only to be challenged by Edmund Curll:
The race seemingly having been decided by progress through bed-pan slops, Curll prays to Jove, who consults the goddess Cloacina. He hears the prayer, passes a pile of feces down, and catapults Curll to the victory. As Curll grabs the phantom Moore, the poems it seemed to have fly back to their real authors, and even the clothes go to the unpaid tailors who had made them (James Moore Smythe had run through an inherited fortune and bankrupted himself by 1727). Dulness urges Curll to repeat the joke, to pretend to the public that his dull poets were really great poets, to print things by false names. (Curll had published numerous works by &quot;Joseph Gay&quot; to trick the public into thinking they were by John Gay.) For his victory, she awards Curll a tapestry showing the fates of famous Dunces. On it, he sees Daniel Defoe with his ears chopped off, John Tutchin being whipped publicly through western England, two political journalists clubbed to death (on the same day), and himself being wrapped in a blanket and whipped by the schoolboys of Westminster (for having printed an unauthorised edition of the sermons of the school&#x27;s master, thereby robbing the school&#x27;s own printer).

The next contest Dulness proposes is for the phantom poetess, Eliza (Eliza Haywood). She is compared to their Hera. Whereas Hera was &quot;cow-eyed&quot; in &quot;Iliad&quot;, and &quot;of the herders&quot;, Haywood inverts these to become a
The booksellers will urinate to see whose urinary stream is the highest. Curll and Chetham compete. Chetham&#x27;s efforts are insufficient to produce an arc, and he splashes his own face. Curll, on the other hand, produces a stream over his own head, burning (with an implied case of venereal disease) all the while. For this, Chetham is awarded a kettle, while Curll gets the phantom lady&#x27;s works and company.

The next contest is for authors, and it is the game of &quot;tickling&quot;: getting money from patrons by flattery. A very wealthy nobleman, attended by jockeys, huntsmen, a large sedan chair with six porters, takes his seat. One poet attempts to flatter his pride. A painter attempts to paint a glowing portrait. An opera author attempts to please his ears. John Oldmixon simply asks for the money (Oldmixon had attacked Pope in &quot;The Catholic Poet&quot;, but Pope claims that his real crime was plagiarism in his &quot;Critical History of England&quot;, which slandered the Stuarts and got him an office from the Whig ministry), only to have the lord clench his money tighter. Finally, a young man with no artistic ability sends his sister to the lord and wins the prize.

Another contest, primarily for critics, comes next. In this, Dulness offers up the prize of a &quot;catcall&quot; and a drum that can drown out the braying of asses to the one who can make the most senseless noise and impress the king of monkeys. They are invited to improve mustard-bowl thunder (as the sound effect of thunder on the stage had been made using a mustard bowl and a shot previously, and John Dennis had invented a new method) and the sound of the bell (used in tragedies to enhance the pitiful action). Pope describes the resulting game thus:
The critics are then invited to all bray at the same time. In this, Richard Blackmore wins easily:
(Blackmore had written six epic poems, a &quot;Prince&quot; and &quot;King&quot; Arthur, in twenty books, an &quot;Eliza&quot; in ten books, an &quot;Alfred&quot; in twelve books, etc. and had earned the nickname &quot;Everlasting Blackmore&quot;. Additionally, Pope disliked his overuse of the verb &quot;bray&quot; for love and battle and so had chosen to have Blackmore&#x27;s &quot;bray&quot; the most insistent.)

The assembled horde go down by Bridewell (the women&#x27;s prison) between 11:00 am and 12:00 pm, when the women prisoners are being whipped, and go &quot;To where Fleet-ditch with disemboguing streams/ Rolls the large tribute of dead dogs to Thames&quot; (II 259-260). At the time, the River Fleet was the city&#x27;s sewer outlet, where all of the gutters of the city washed into the river. It was silted, muddy, and mixed with river and city waters.

In the ditch, the political hacks are ordered to strip off their clothes and engage in a diving contest. Dulness says, &quot;Who flings most filth, and wide pollutes around / The stream, be his the Weekly Journals, bound&quot; (II 267–268), while a load of lead will go to the deepest diver and a load of coal to the others who participate. &quot;The Weekly Journals&quot; was a collective noun, referring to &quot;London Journal&quot;, &quot;Mist&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;British Journal&quot;, &quot;Daily Journal&quot;, etc. In this contest, John Dennis climbs up as high as a post and dives in, disappearing forever. Next, &quot;Smedly&quot; (Jonathan Smedley, a religious opportunist who criticised Jonathan Swift for gain) dives in and vanishes. Others attempt the task, but none succeed like Leonard Welsted (who had satirised Pope, Gay, and Arbuthnot&#x27;s play &quot;Three Hours after Marriage&quot; in 1717), for he goes in swinging his arms like a windmill (to splash all with mud): &quot;No crab more active in the dirty dance, / Downward to climb, and backward to advance&quot; (II 298–299). He wins the &quot;Journals&quot;, but Smedly reappears, saying that he had gone all the way down to Hades, where he had seen that a branch of Styx flows into the Thames, so that all who drink city water grow dull and forgetful from Lethe.

Smedly becomes Dulness&#x27;s high priest, and the company move to Ludgate. There, the young critics are asked to weigh the difference between Richard Blackmore and John &quot;Orator&quot; Henley. The one who can will be the chief judge of Dulness. Three second year students (&quot;college sophs&quot;) from Cambridge University and three lawyers from Temple Bar attempt the task, but they all fall asleep. The entire company slowly falls asleep, with the last being Susanna Centlivre (who had attacked Pope&#x27;s translation of Homer before its publication) and &quot;Norton Defoe&quot; (another false identity created by a political author who claimed to be the &quot;true son&quot; of Daniel Defoe). Finally, Folly herself is killed by the dullness of the works being read aloud. The result is, appropriately, that there is no judge for Dulness, for Dulness requires an absence of judgment.

====&quot;A&quot; Book III====
Book three is set in the Temple of Dulness in the city. Theobald sleeps with his head on the goddess&#x27;s lap, with royal blue fogs surrounding him. In his dream, he goes to Hades and visits the shade of Elkannah Settle. There he sees millions of souls waiting for new bodies as their souls transmigrate. Bavius dips each soul in Lethe to make it dull before sending it to a new body. (In classical mythology, the souls of the dead were put into Lethe to forget their lives before passing on to their final reward, but these are dipped in Lethe before being born.) Elkannah Settle hails Theobald as the great promised one, the messiah of Dulness, for Bavius had dipped him over and over again, from lifetime to lifetime, before he was perfected in stupidity and ready to be born as Theobald. Theobald had formerly been a Boeotian, several Dutchmen, several monks, all before being himself: &quot;All nonsense thus, of old or modern date, / Shall in thee centre, from thee circulate&quot; (III 51–52).

Settle gives Theobald full knowledge of Dulness. This is his baptism: the time when he can claim his divine role and begin his mission (in a parody of Jesus being blessed by the Holy Spirit). Settle shows Theobald the past triumphs of Dulness in its battles with reason and science. He surveys the : the Great Wall of China and the emperor burning all learned books, Egypt and Omar I burning the books in the Ptolemean library. Then he turns to follow the light of the sun/learning to Europe and says,
Goths, Alans, Huns, Ostrogoths, Visigoths, and Islam are all seen as destroyers of learning. Christianity in the medieval period is also an enemy of learning and reason in Settle&#x27;s view:
Pope lambasts the medieval popes for destroying statuary and books that depicted Classical gods and goddesses and for vandalising others, for making statues of Pan into Moses.

Settle then surveys the future. He says that Grub Street will be Dulness&#x27;s Mount Parnassus, where the goddess will &quot;Behold a hundred sons, and each a dunce&quot; (III 130). He names two sons of contemporary dunces who were already showing signs of stupidity: Theophilus Cibber (III 134) and the son of Bishop Burnet.

Settle turns to examine the present state of &quot;duncery&quot;, and this section of the third book is the longest. He first looks to literary critics, who are happiest when their authors complain the most. Scholars are described as:

From critics, he turns to the contrastive of triumphant dunces and lost merit. Orator Henley gets special attention here (lines 195 ff.). Henley had set himself up as a professional lecturer. On Sundays, he would discuss theology, and on Wednesdays any other subject, and those who went to hear him would pay a shilling each (&quot;Oh great Restorer of the good old Stage, / Preacher at once, and Zany of thy Age!&quot; III 201–202), while learned bishops and skilled preachers spoke to empty congregations. Next come the theatres: a &quot;Dr. Faustus&quot; was the toast of the 1726–1727 season, with both Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields and Drury Lane competing for more and more lavish stage effects to get the audiences in:
Even though Pope was on good terms with some of the men involved (e.g. Henry Carey, who provided music for the Drury Lane version), the two companies are fighting to see who can make the least sense. This competition of vulgarity is led by two theatres, and each has its champion of decadence. At Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields is the &quot;Angel of Dulness&quot;, John Rich:
Rich&#x27;s ability to ride in a stage whirlwind (in parody of God in the Book of Job) is matched by Colley Cibber and Barton Booth, patentees of the Drury Lane theatre, who mount the stage in purple dragons and have an aerial battle. Dulness is the winner in these contests, for she benefits. Settle urges Theobald to refine these entertainments, to hammer them home and get them all the way to court, so that Dulness can be the true empress of the land. He prophesies that Theobald will live in an age that will see Laurence Eusden the Poet Laureate and Colley Cibber the &quot;Lord Chancellor of plays&quot;.

Settle then reveals some current triumphs of dullness over good sense. He mentions William Benson as the proper judge of architecture:
William Benson was a fool who had taken the place of Sir Christopher Wren and told the House of Lords that the house was unsound and falling down. It was not. John Gay never obtained a pension and yet was often remarked as one of the most jovial, intelligent, and compassionate wits of the age. Jonathan Swift had been &quot;exiled&quot; to Ireland, where he had become involved in Irish politics. Pope himself had spent three years translating Homer. Settle sees in these things great prospects for the coming age of darkness.

The poem ends with a vision of the apocalypse of nonsense:
Settle invokes the second coming of stupidity, urging,

At the very conclusion, Theobald cannot take any more joy, and he wakes. The vision goes back through the ivory gate of Morpheus.

===Themes of &quot;The Dunciad A&quot;===
The Three Book &quot;Dunciad&quot; has an extensive inversion of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, but it also structures itself heavily around a Christological theme. To some degree, this imagery of unholy consecration had been present in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;MacFlecknoe&quot;, but Pope&#x27;s King of Dunces is much more menacing than Thomas Shadwell could ever have been in Dryden&#x27;s poem. It is not a case of an unworthy man getting praised that spurs the poem, but rather a force of degradation and decadence that motivates it. Pope is not targeting one man, but rather a social decline that he feels is all but irrevocable. Nevertheless, the poem is still a satire and not a lamentation. The top of society (the kings) may be dulled by spectacle and freak shows, but Dulness is only one force. She is at war with the men of wit, and she can be opposed. In the Four Book &quot;Dunciad&quot; (or &quot;Dunciad B&quot;), any hope of redemption or reversal is gone, and the poem is even more nihilistic.

==The four-book &quot;Dunciad B&quot; of 1743==
In 1741, Pope wrote a fourth book of the &quot;Dunciad&quot; and had it published the next year as a stand-alone text. He also began revising the whole poem to create a new, integrated, and darker version of the text. The four-book &quot;Dunciad&quot; appeared in 1743 as a new work. Most of the critical and pseudo-critical apparatus was repeated from the &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot; of 1738, but there was a new &quot;Advertisement to the Reader&quot; by Bishop Warburton and one new substantial piece: a schematic of anti-heroes, written by Pope in his own voice, entitled &quot;Hyper-Critics of Ricardus Aristarchus&quot;. The most obvious change from the three-book to the four-book &quot;Dunciad&quot; was the change of hero from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.

===Colley Cibber: King of Dunces===
Pope&#x27;s choice of new &#x27;hero&#x27; for the revised Dunciad, Colley Cibber, the pioneer of sentimental drama and celebrated comic actor, was the outcome of a long public squabble that originated in 1717, when Cibber introduced jokes onstage at the expense of a poorly received farce, &quot;Three Hours After Marriage&quot;, written by Pope with John Arbuthnot and John Gay. Pope was in the audience and naturally infuriated, as was Gay, who got into a physical fight with Cibber on a subsequent visit to the theatre. Pope published a pamphlet satirising Cibber, and continued his literary assault until his death, the situation escalating following Cibber&#x27;s politically motivated appointment to the post of poet laureate in 1730. Cibber&#x27;s role in the feud is notable for his &#x27;polite&#x27; forbearance until, at the age of 71, he finally became exasperated. An anecdote in &quot;A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope&quot;, published in 1742, recounts their trip to a brothel organised by Pope&#x27;s own patron, who apparently intended to stage a cruel joke at the expense of the poet. Since Pope was only about 4&#x27; tall, with a hunchback, due to a childhood tubercular infection of the spine, and the prostitute specially chosen as Pope&#x27;s &#x27;treat&#x27; was the fattest and largest on the premises, the tone of the event is fairly self-apparent. Cibber describes his &#x27;heroic&#x27; role in snatching Pope off of the prostitute&#x27;s body, where he was precariously perched like a tom-tit, while Pope&#x27;s patron looked on, sniggering, thereby saving English poetry. In the third book of the first version of Dunciad (1728), Pope had referred contemptuously to Cibber&#x27;s &quot;past, vamp&#x27;d, future, old, reviv&#x27;d, new&quot; plays, produced with &quot;less human genius than God gives an ape&quot;. While Cibber&#x27;s elevation to laureateship in 1730 had further inflamed Pope against him, there is little speculation involved in suggesting that Cibber&#x27;s anecdote, with particular reference to Pope&#x27;s &quot;little-tiny manhood&quot;, motivated the revision of hero. Pope&#x27;s own explanation of the change of hero, given in the guise of Ricardus Aristarchus, provides a detailed justification for why Colley Cibber should be the perfect hero for a mock-heroic parody.

Aristarchus&#x27;s &quot;hyper-criticism&quot; establishes a science for the mock heroic and follows up some of the ideas set forth by Pope in &quot;Peri Bathous&quot; in the &quot;Miscellanies, Volume the Third&quot; (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have &quot;Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery&quot;. As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, &quot;Let the world ... impute to me what Folly or weakness they please; but till &quot;Wisdom&quot; can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be &quot;. Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one&#x27;s courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber&#x27;s claim in the &quot;Apology&quot; that his face was almost the best known in England. Chivalric love is the mark of a hero, and Pope says that this is something easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, &quot;a man has his Whore&quot; at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, magnanimity that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the &quot;lesser epic&quot; hero (Pope uses the term &quot;lesser epic&quot; to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is &quot;Buffoonry&quot; that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber&#x27;s offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was &quot;a person never a hero even on the Stage&quot;, he sets himself out as an admirable and &quot;imitable&quot; person who expects applause for his vices.

===The argument of the four-book &quot;Dunciad&quot;===
Most of the argument of the &quot;Dunciad B&quot; is the same as that of &quot;Dunciad A&quot;: it begins with the same Lord Mayor&#x27;s Day, goes to Dulness contemplating her realm, moves to &quot;Cibber&quot; (called &quot;Bays&quot;, in honour of his being Poet Laureate and thereby having the laurel wreath and butt of sherry) in despair, announces Cibber&#x27;s choice as new King of Dunces, etc. Other than a change of hero, however, Pope made numerous adaptations and expansions of key passages. Not only are the topical references altered to fit Cibber&#x27;s career, but Pope consistently changes the nature of the satire subtly by increasing the overarching metaphor of Cibber as &quot;Anti-Christ of Wit&quot;, rather than Classical hero of Dulness. Most of the adaptations increase the parody of the Bible at the expense of the parody of Virgil.

====&quot;B&quot; Book I====
The invocation changes from &quot;the one who brings&quot; the Smithfield muses to the ears of kings to &quot;The Mighty Mother, and her Son who brings&quot;, thus immediately making Cibber the fatherless son of a goddess, and the poem addresses &quot;... how the Goddess bade Britannia sleep, / And pour&#x27;d her Spirit o&#x27;er the land and deep&quot; (I 7–8). From the invocation, the poem moves to an expanded description of the Cave of Poverty and Poetry, near Bedlam. Cibber is the co-master of the cave, &quot;Where o&#x27;er the gates [of Bedlam], by his fam&#x27;d father&#x27;s hand/ Great Cibber&#x27;s brazen, brainless brothers stand&quot; (I 31–32) (referring to statues constructed by Caius Cibber, Colley Cibber&#x27;s father), and the cave is now the source of &quot;Journals, Medleys, Merc&#x27;ries, Magazines&quot; (I 42). These changes introduce the Biblical and apocalyptical themes that Book IV, in particular, will explore, as Dulness&#x27;s spirit parodies the Holy Spirit dwelling upon the face of the waters in the Book of Genesis.

When Dulness chooses her new king, she settles on Bays, who is seen in his study surveying his own works:
The base of Cibber&#x27;s pile of sacrificed books is several commonplace books, which are the basis of all his own productions. Although Cibber confesses:
The accidental common sense was &quot;The Careless Husband&quot;. When Cibber casts about for new professions, he, unlike Theobald in 1732, decides, &quot;Hold—to the Minister I more incline; / To serve his cause, O Queen! is serving thine&quot; (I 213–214). The &quot;minister&quot; is Robert Walpole, an extremely unpopular Whig leader, and the &quot;queen&quot; is both Dulness and Queen Caroline of Hanover, who was a Tory enemy for her reconciliation of George II with Walpole. When the new king is about to burn his books in despair, Pope heightens the religious imagery, for Cibber says to his books, &quot;Unstain&#x27;d, untouch&#x27;d, and yet in maiden sheets;/ While all your smutty sisters walk the streets&quot; (I 229–230), and it is better that they be burned than that they be wrapped in &quot;Oranges, to pelt your sire&quot; (I 236). Again, Dulness extinguishes the pyre with a sheet of the ever-wet &quot;Thule&quot;.

Cibber goes to Dulness&#x27;s palace, and Pope says that he feels at home there, and &quot;So Spirits ending their terrestrial race, / Ascend, and recognize their Native Place&quot; (I 267–268). The Christian Heaven-home of Puritan songs is altered for Cibber to the originating sleep of Dulness. While in the &quot;Dunciad A&quot; the palace had been empty, it is here crowded with ghosts (the same dunces mentioned in 1727, but all having died in the interim). Dulness calls forth her servants to herald the new king, and the book ends with Dulness&#x27;s prayer, which takes an apocalyptic tone in the new version:
====&quot;B&quot; Book II====

Most of Book II of the &quot;Dunciad B&quot; is the same as &quot;Dunciad A.&quot; The Dunce Games are largely the same, with a few changes in personnel. Cibber watches all, with &quot;A brain of feathers, and a heart of lead&quot; (II 44). The contest of booksellers is generally as it was in 1727, with Curll slipping on bedpan slops. However, when Curll prays to Cloacina, Pope provides more motivation for her hearing his prayer:
Further, Cloacina aids Curll win the race herself, and not by intercession with Jove, and Pope here explains &quot;how&quot; she propels him to victory: she makes the ordure nourishment to Curll, and he &quot;Imbibes new life, and scours and stinks along&quot; (&quot;B&quot; II 106). Again, the phantom poet, More, vanishes. The game for Eliza Heywood&#x27;s person and poetry is the same as the previous version, except that the promised gift for the runner-up is a chamber pot. Curll here competes with Thomas Osborne, a bookseller who had claimed to sell Pope&#x27;s subscription edition of &quot;Iliad&quot; at half price, when he had merely pirated it, cut the size of the book to octavo, and printed on low quality paper. Curll wins Eliza, and Osborne is crowned with the pot.

The &quot;tickling&quot; contest is the same, except that Thomas Bentley, nephew of Richard Bentley the classicist, replaces Richard Blackmore. This Bentley had written a fawning ode on the son of Robert Harley (a former friend of Pope&#x27;s with whom he seems estranged). In the noise battle, Dulness tells her poets,
In the braying contest that follows, there is a noise that seems to come &quot;from the deep Divine; / There Webster! peal&#x27;d thy voice, and Whitfield! thine&quot; (&quot;B&quot; II 257–258). Webster was a radical Protestant religious writer who had demanded the scourging of the church, and Whitfield was George Whitfield, the notable collaborator with John Wesley, who agreed with Webster only &quot;to abuse all the sober Clergy&quot;. Richard Blackmore appears again as the single singer with the loudest &quot;bray&quot;.

The progress by Bridewell to Fleet-ditch and the muck-diving games are the same, but, again, with some changes of dunces. Oldmixon, who had appeared in 1727 as one of the ticklers, is here the elderly diver who replaces John Dennis. Smedley and Concanen are the same, but Pope adds a new section on party political papers:
These &quot;sons of a day&quot; are the daily newspapers that only had lifespans of a single issue. They were frequently printed with two different papers on the same sheet of paper (front and back), and Pope quotes the investigation into Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford (conducted by Walpole&#x27;s administration) as showing that the Tory ministry of Pope&#x27;s friends had spent over fifty thousand pounds to support political papers. The dead gazettes are mourned only by &quot;Mother Osborne&quot; (James Pitt, who had run the &quot;London Journal&quot; under the name of &quot;Father Osborne&quot;; he had been called &quot;Mother Osborne&quot; for his dull, pedantic style). The champion of splattering in &quot;Dunciad B&quot; is William Arnal, a party author of the &quot;British Journal&quot; who had gotten ten thousand pounds as a political hack. In keeping with the insertion of Webster and Whitfield, earlier, Pope takes a new turn and has the winner of the depth dive be the Archbishop of Canterbury, John Potter (1674–1747), and he is surrounded by an army of minor authors, &quot;Prompt or to guard or stab, to saint or damn, / Heav&#x27;n&#x27;s Swiss, who fight for any God, or Man&quot; (&quot;B&quot; II 357–358). These trimming religious authors are people like Benjamin Hoadley (who had been an aid to Smedley) and John &quot;Orator&quot; Henley. Potter describes the vision of Hades and the Styx pouring into the Thames, but it is not merely Lethe that pours in. Lethe and the effluvia of dreams go into the Thames, so the effect is that it &quot;Intoxicates the pert, and lulls the grave&quot; (&quot;B&quot; II 344). The Archbishop of Canterbury becomes the Archbishop of Dulness.

The book concludes with the contest of reading Blackmore and Henley.

====&quot;B&quot; Book III====
Book III is, like Book II, largely the same text as the &quot;Dunciad Variorum&quot;. In light of the new fourth book and the subtle changes of Book I, however, some passages take on more menace. The opening, in which Cibber rests with his head in Dulness&#x27;s lap, is here a clear parody of the Madonna with child. The vision granted Cibber is less Christological, as Cibber is not given a mission in the same way with an infusion of the Unholy Spirit, as Book IV provides a new ending, but the general vision of Hades is the same. Cibber visits the shade of Elkannah Settle and is shown the and its inverse, the , as learning moves ever westward across the world, with the sun, and darkness springs up right behind it.

In the survey of the formless poets waiting to be born (in print), Cibber sees the same faces as Theobald had, but with a few excisions and additions. The implied homosexual couple of critics from the &quot;Dunciad A&quot; are cut, but a mass of nameless poets contend, &quot;who foremost shall be dam&#x27;d to Fame&quot; (&quot;B&quot; III 158) (both cursed with fame and damned by the goddess Fama for being an idiot), and altogether,
As in the previous version, these struggling hack writers and political character assassins are contrasted to the glorious dunces who win all the money and fame of the kingdom, while worthy ministers and divines go ignored. Thus, Settle features Orator Henley as a paragon,
As in the three book &quot;Dunciad&quot;, Settle shows the happy triumph of Dulness on the stage, but the lines are compressed and take on a new parodic context:
The theatre is providing a mockery of the Apocalypse and the second coming, an inverted, man-made spectacle of the divine. For these accomplishments, Settle blesses Cibber and mourns his own failure in Dulness&#x27;s service. For Cibber,
Settle then takes a glance at the loss of learning incipient in the age. In architecture, the fool triumphant is Ripley, who was making a new Admiralty building, while &quot;Jones&#x27; and Boyle&#x27;s&quot; fail. Settle wishes for the day to come soon when Eton and Westminster are in permanent holiday. As with the earlier version of the poem, the book ends with Cibber excitedly waking from his dream.

====Book IV====
Book IV was entirely new to the &quot;Dunciad B&quot; and had been published first as a stand-alone concluding poem. Pope himself referred to the four-book version &quot;the &quot;Greater Dunciad&quot;&quot;, in keeping with the &quot;Greater Iliad&quot;. It is also &quot;greater&quot; in that its subject is larger. Book IV can function as a separate piece or as the conclusion of the &quot;Dunciad&quot;: in many ways its structure and tone are substantially different from the first three books, and it is much more allegorical.

It opens with a second, nihilistic invocation:
The fourth book promises to show the obliteration of sense from England. The Dog-star shines, the lunatic prophets speak, and the daughter of Chaos and Nox (Dulness) rises to &quot;dull and venal a new World to mold&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 15) and begin a Saturnian age of lead.

Dulness takes her throne, and Pope describes the allegorical tableau of her throne room. Science is chained beneath her foot-stool. Logic is gagged and bound. Wit has been exiled from her kingdom entirely. Rhetoric is stripped on the ground and tied by sophism. Morality is dressed in a gown that is bound by two cords, of furs (the ermines of judges) and lawn (the fabric of bishops sleeves), and at a nod from Dulness, her &quot;page&quot; (a notorious hanging judge named Page who had had over one hundred people executed) pulls both cords tight and strangles her. The Muses are bound in tenfold chains and guarded by Flattery and Envy. Only mathematics is free, because it is too insane to be bound. Nor, Pope says, could Chesterfield refrain from weeping upon seeing the sight (for Chesterfield had opposed the Licensing Act 1737, which is the chaining of the Muses). Colley Cibber, however, slumbers, his head in Dulness&#x27;s lap. (In a note, Pope says that it is proper for Cibber to sleep through the whole of Book IV, as he had had no part in the actions of book II, slept through book III, and therefore ought to go on sleeping.)

Into the audience chamber, a &quot;Harlot form&quot; &quot;with mincing step, small voice, and languid eye&quot; comes in (&quot;B&quot; IV 45–46). This is opera, who wears patchwork clothing (for operas being made up of the patchwork of extant plays and being itself a mixed form of singing and acting). Opera then speaks to Dulness of the Muses:
However, Opera warns Dulness that Handel is a threat to her. His operas make too much sense, have too strong a plot, and are too masculine in their performance. Accordingly, Dulness banishes Handel to Ireland.
Fame blows her &quot;posterior trumpet&quot;, and all the dunces of the land come to Dulness&#x27;s throne. There are three classes of dunce. First, there are the naturally dull. These are drawn to her as bees are to a queen bee, and they &quot;adhere&quot; to her person. The second are the people who do not wish to be dunces but are, &quot;Whate&#x27;er of mungril no one class admits, / A wit with dunces, and a dunce with wits&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 89–90). These dunces orbit Dulness. They struggle to break free, and they get some distance from her, but they are too weak to flee. The third class are &quot;false to Phoebus, bow to Baal; / Or impious, preach his Word without a call&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 93–94). They are men and women who do dull things by supporting dunces, either by giving money to hacks or by suppressing the cause of worthy writers. These people come to Dulness as a comet does: although they are only occasionally near her, they habitually do her bidding. Of this last group, Pope classes Sir Thomas Hanmer, a &quot;decent knight&quot;, who absurdly thinks himself a great Shakespeare editor and uses his own money to publish an exceptionally lavish and ornate edition (with a text that was based on Pope&#x27;s own edition). He is outshone in darkness by one Benson, who is even more absurd, in that he begins putting up monuments of John Milton, striking coins and medals of Milton, and translating Milton&#x27;s Latin poetry and who had then passed from excessive Milton fanaticism to fanaticism for Arthur Johnston, a Scottish physician and Latin poet. Unable to be the most fantastically vain man, Hamner prepares to withdraw his edition, but &quot;Apollo&#x27;s May&#x27;r and Aldermen&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 116) take the page from him. (This was a reference to Oxford University Press, with which Pope had a quarrel based on their denying Bishop Warburton a doctorate in 1741). Dulness tells her followers to imitate Benson and tack their own names to statues and editions of famous authors, to treat standard authors as trophies (the busts made of them like hunting trophies), and thus &quot;So by each Bard an Alderman shall sit&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 131).

All of the dunces press forward, vying to be the first to speak, but a ghost comes forward who awes them all and makes all to shake in fear. Doctor Busby, headmaster of Westminster School appears, &quot;Dropping with Infant&#x27;s blood, and Mother&#x27;s tears&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 142) from the birch cane that he used to whip boys, and every man in the hall begins to tremble. Busby tells Dulness that he is her true champion, for he turns geniuses to fools, &quot;Whate&#x27;er the talents, or howe&#x27;er design&#x27;d, / We hang one jingling padlock on the mind&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 161–162). Dulness agrees and wishes for a pedant king like James I again, who will &quot;stick the Doctor&#x27;s Chair into the Throne&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 177), for only a pedant king would insist on what her priests (and only hers) proclaim: &quot;The of Kings to govern wrong&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 188), for Cambridge and Oxford still uphold the doctrine.

As soon as she mentions them, the professors of Cambridge and Oxford (except for Christ Church college) rush to her, &quot;Each fierce Logician, still expelling Locke&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 196). (John Locke had been censured by Oxford University in 1703, and his &quot;Essay on Human Understanding&quot; had been banned.) These professors give way to their greatest figure, Richard Bentley, who appears with his Quaker hat on and refuses to bow to Dulness. Bentley tells Dulness that he and critics like him are her true champions, for he had &quot;made Horace dull, and humbled Milton&#x27;s strains&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 212) and, no matter what her enemies do, critics will always serve Dulness, for &quot;Turn what they will to Verse, their toil is vain,/ Critics like me shall make it Prose again&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 213–214). Picking fine arguments on letters and single textual variants and correcting authors, he will make all wits useless, and clerics, he says, are the purely dull, though the works of Isaac Barrow and Francis Atterbury might argue otherwise. He says that it is &quot;For thee explain a thing till all men doubt it,/ And write about it, Goddess, and about it&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 251–252). They cement over all wit, throwing stone back onto the figures that authors had chiselled out of marble. As he makes his boast, he sees a whore, a pupil, and a French governor come forward, and the devout Bentley skulks away.

The French governor attempts to speak to Dulness but cannot be heard over the French horn sound that emerges, so the pupil tells his story. The &quot;governor&quot; is an English nobleman who went to school and college without learning anything, then went abroad on the Grand Tour, on which &quot;Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 294). He went to Paris and Rome and &quot;he saunter&#x27;d Europe round, / And gather&#x27;d ev&#x27;ry Vice on Christian ground&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 311–312). At the end of his travels, he is &quot;perfectly well-bred, / With nothing but a Solo in his head&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 323–324), and he has returned to England with a despoiled nun following him. She is pregnant with his child (or the student&#x27;s) and destined for the life of a prostitute (a kept woman), and the lord is going to run for Parliament so that he can avoid arrest. Dulness welcomes the three—the devious student, the brainless lord, and the spoiled nun—and spreads her own cloak about the girl, which &quot;frees from sense of Shame&quot;.

After the vacuous traveller, an idle lord appears, yawning with the pain of sitting on an easy chair. He does nothing at all. Immediately after him, Annius speaks. He is the natural predator for idling nobles, for he is a forger of antiquities (named for Annio di Viterbo) who teaches the nobles to value their false Roman coins above their houses and their forged Virgil manuscripts above their own clothing. He serves Dulness by teaching her servants to vaunt their stupidity with their wealth.

<text>Explorer II was a crewed U.S. high-altitude balloon that was launched on November 11, 1935, and reached a record altitude of . Launched at 8:00 am from the Stratobowl in South Dakota, the helium balloon carried a two-man crew consisting of U.S. Army Air Corps Captains Albert W. Stevens and Orvil A. Anderson inside a sealed, spherical cabin. The crew landed safely near White Lake, South Dakota, at 4:13 pm and both were acclaimed as national heroes. Scientific instruments carried on the gondola returned useful information about the stratosphere. The mission was funded by the membership of the National Geographic Society.

==Background==
In January 1934, the National Geographic Society (NGS) and the U.S. Army Air Corps decided to collaborate on a program to build and launch a manned balloon to the then record altitude of . This vehicle would be capable of carrying a crew of three in an airtight capsule, along with a laboratory of instruments. The hydrogen balloon, named &quot;Explorer&quot;, was completed by July at a cost of around $60,000; currency.

The balloon was launched from a canyon in the Black Hills of South Dakota—dubbed the Stratobowl—on July 28, 1934 and reached a near-record altitude of before tears in the fabric led the crew to begin reducing their altitude. A rupture in the balloon resulted in a precipitous descent, followed by a spark that caused the hydrogen to ignite and destroy what was left of the balloon, leaving the capsule to plummet toward the ground at terminal velocity. The crew just managed to escape using their parachutes, with the last man bailing out at above the ground. Their capsule was almost completely destroyed upon impact.

The crash resulted in a national embarrassment, leading Captain Albert W. Stevens, the scientific observer on board the &quot;Explorer&quot; balloon, to lobby for another attempt with an improved balloon to be named &quot;Explorer II&quot;. But news of the fatal crash of a Russian stratospheric attempt in 1934 left President Gilbert H. Grosvenor of the NGS sobered by the risk. A review of the crash by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) was held between July and September, revealing that the balloon had not opened symmetrically during the ascent, causing stresses that led to the fabric tears. A month-long delay prior to launch had allowed the rubberized cotton to stick together, which created the uneven expansion. The hydrogen explosion followed when the gas in the bag mixed with the oxygen in the atmosphere.

==Preparation==
Despite the concerns, in 1935 the NGS and Army Air Corps decided to make another attempt. To eliminate the hazard of the hydrogen lifting gas, it was decided instead to use helium—to which the United States had a monopoly. The lower lifting efficiency of helium gas meant that a larger balloon would be needed, so Goodyear-Zeppelin increased the volume to . Dow Chemical Company assembled a larger, lighter gondola made of &quot;Dowmetal&quot;—a magnesium-aluminium alloy— that would carry a two-man crew with a reduced amount of scientific instrumentation. The cabin was in diameter with a mass of and could transport a payload. It was manufactured from a single, large plate that was cut up into form that could be reshaped and welded into a sphere. In order to make crew escape easier, the portholes were made wider than on the &quot;Explorer I&quot;. The atmosphere in the interior of the capsule was supplied from liquid air instead of liquid oxygen in order to reduce the fire hazard. The modified balloon was ready by the spring of 1935 and the first launch occurred July 10, 1935. Unfortunately, this too proved a failure with the balloon rupturing at liftoff.

Following a review by the NBS, the balloon was prepared for another attempt after Goodyear strengthened the material. Examination of climatological data for the Stratobowl collected over the previous fifteen years was examined, and it was determined that the month of October typically had periods of good weather that would last sufficiently long for a flight attempt. A team of meteorologists was assembled at the Stratobowl in early September and they proceeded to put together a weather station. The meteorological requirements for the launch was for clear skies—with no precipitation—lasting for the duration of the flight, as well as surface wind speeds that were not to exceed .

With a cold front approaching, on the night of November 10, 1935, the balloon was prepared for launch. The temperature dropped to overnight, so the of fabric was kept warm and pliable through the use of stoves. The task of inflating the balloon with helium from the 1,685 steel cylinders took eight hours, during which the team needed to repair a long tear that formed in the fabric. Once inflated, the balloon stood tall. The gondola was kept anchored to the earth by a team of more than 100 soldiers holding cables. Preparations were complete by 7:01 am the following morning and the conditions were deemed suitable for a launch.

==Flight==
The crew of the &quot;Explorer II&quot; consisted of Captain Albert W. Stevens, in command of the mission, and Captain Orvil A. Anderson. A crowd of around 20,000 viewers gathered to watch the event. (The local residents had raised and contributed $13,000 for the mission.) Lift-off occurred at precisely 8:00 am with the release of of ballast made of fine lead shot. A few moments after liftoff, wind shear propelled the balloon into a side canyon, but thereafter it ascended normally.

The &quot;Explorer II&quot; reached a peak altitude of at 12:30 pm and remained there for 80 minutes. This set a new world altitude record, and one that would last for nearly two decades. The crew became the first humans to document the curvature of the Earth. Unfortunately, the fan that was to be used to rotate the gondola proved ineffective at that altitude, so they were unable to avoid the Sun&#x27;s glare. This made viewing from one side of the capsule nearly useless. Despite this, Captain Stevens reported seeing details of the Earth&#x27;s surface for hundreds of miles. They were too high up to be able to view any movement on the ground, but their photography showed the potential of high-altitude reconnaissance balloons.

&quot;Explorer II&quot; included communications equipment, and constant radio contact was maintained throughout the flight with the signal being broadcast across the U.S. and in Europe. The onboard instruments collected data on cosmic rays, the ozone distribution and electrical conductivity of the atmosphere at different altitudes, the atmospheric composition of the stratosphere, and the luminosity of the Sun, Moon and Earth. In addition, microorganisms were collected from the stratosphere. Mold samples were carried along to determine the effects of cosmic ray exposure. Stevens took along a camera to take pictures, including the first ever motion pictures shot from the stratosphere. The collected data showed that the ozone in the upper atmosphere was effective at blocking most of the ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It was also found that the percentage of oxygen at the peak altitude was about the same as that at sea level.

Finally, the descent was begun and it proceeded normally. At an altitude of , the crew began releasing scientific instruments that would descend by their own parachutes. This was done to protect the data in case the gondola had a rough landing. The precautions proved unnecessary as the balloon landed gently in an open field near the town of White Lake, South Dakota at 4:13 pm.

==Aftermath==
The success of the mission was much celebrated in the press and the aeronauts were invited to an audience with U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They became national heroes and both men were presented with the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society by General John J. Pershing. The Air Corps awarded them the Mackay Trophy for the most meritorious flight of the year. Both men were also awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for each of the Explorer flights.

Scientific observations made during the mission were highly successful and much data was collected, with the results appearing in scientific journals. The data and the crew experiences were later used when designing flight crew equipment and methods for high-altitude combat operations during World War II. The balloon used for the &quot;Explorer II&quot; expedition was cut up into a million strips and distributed as commemorative bookmarks among the NGS members who supported the mission. The gondola is on display at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum.

<doc id="1090754" wikidata="Q2469326" url="?curid=1090754" title="Watcher (angel)">
<text>A Watcher (Aramaic עִיר &quot;ʿiyr&quot;, plural עִירִין &quot;ʿiyrin&quot;, Greek: ἐιρ or ἐγρήγορος, &quot;egrḗgoros&quot;) is a type of biblical angel. The word is related to the root meaning to be awake. It occurs in both plural and singular forms in the Book of Daniel, where reference is made to the holiness of the beings. The apocryphal Books of Enoch (2nd–1st centuries BC) refer to both good and bad Watchers, with a primary focus on the rebellious ones.

== Good watchers in Daniel ==
In the Book of Daniel 4:13, 17, 23 (ESV), there are three references to the class of &quot;watcher, holy one&quot; (&quot;watcher&quot;, Aramaic ; &quot;holy one&quot;, Aramaic ). The term is introduced by Nebuchadnezzar who says he saw &quot;a watcher, a holy one come down (singular verb) from heaven.&quot; He describes how in his dream the watcher says that Nebuchadnezzar will eat grass and be mad and that this punishment is &quot;by the decree of the watchers, the demand by the word of the holy ones&quot; ... &quot;that the living may know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men.&quot; After hearing the king&#x27;s dream, Daniel considers for an hour and then responds:

Lutheran Protestant reformer Johann Wigand viewed the &quot;watcher&quot; in Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream as either God himself, or the Son of God. He promoted Trinitarian thinking by linking verse 17 (&quot;This matter is by the decree of the watchers&quot;) with verse 24 (&quot;this is the decree of the Most High&quot;).

Scholars view these &quot;watchers, holy ones&quot; as perhaps showing an influence of Babylonian religion, that is an attempt by the author of this section of Daniel to present Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s Babylonian gods recognizing the power of the god of Israel as &quot;Most High&quot;. The Greek Septuagint version differs from the Aramaic Masoretic Text: for example, the Aramaic text is ambiguous about who is telling the story of verse 14, whether it is Nebuchadnezzar, or the watcher in his dream.

== Books of Enoch ==
In the Books of Enoch, the first Book of Enoch devotes much of its attention to the fall of the watchers. The Second Book of Enoch addresses the watchers (Gk. &quot;egrḗgoroi&quot;) who are in fifth heaven where the fall took place. The Third Book of Enoch gives attention to the unfallen watchers.

The use of the term &quot;watchers&quot; is common in the Book of Enoch. The &quot;Book of the Watchers&quot; (1 Enoch 6–36) occurs in the Aramaic fragments with the phrase &quot;irin we-qadishin&quot;, &quot;Watchers and Holy Ones&quot;, a reference to Aramaic Daniel. The Aramaic &quot;irin&quot; &quot;watchers&quot; is rendered as &quot;angel&quot; (Greek &quot;angelos&quot;, Coptic &quot;malah&quot;) in the Greek and Ethiopian translations, although the usual Aramaic term for angel &quot;malakha&quot; does not occur in Aramaic Enoch.

Some have attempted to date this section of 1 Enoch to around the 2nd–1st century BC and they believe this book is based on one interpretation of the Sons of God passage in Genesis 6, according to which angels mated with human females, giving rise to a race of hybrids known as the Nephilim. The term &quot;irin&quot; is primarily applied to disobedient watchers who numbered a total of 200, and of whom their leaders are named; but equally Aramaic &quot;iri&quot; (&quot;watcher&quot; singular) is applied to the obedient archangels who chain them, such as Raphael (1 Enoch 22:6).

=== Rogue watchers in the Book of Enoch ===
In the Book of Enoch, the watchers (Aramaic עִירִין, &quot;iyrin&quot;) are angels dispatched to Earth to watch over the humans. They soon begin to lust for human women and, at the prodding of their leader Samyaza, defect to illicitly instruct mankind and procreate among them, arriving Mount Hermon. The offspring of these unions are the Nephilim, savage giants who pillage the earth and endanger humanity.

Samyaza and his associates further taught their human charges arts and technologies such as weaponry, cosmetics, mirrors, sorcery, and other techniques that would otherwise be discovered gradually over time by humans, not foisted upon them all at once. Eventually, God allows a Great Flood to rid the earth of the Nephilim, but first sends Uriel to warn Noah so as not to eradicate the human race. The watchers are bound &quot;in the valleys of the Earth&quot; until Judgment Day (Jude verse 6 says, &quot;And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.&quot;).

The chiefs of tens, listed in the Book of Enoch, are as follows:

The book of Enoch also lists leaders of the 200 fallen angels who married and commenced unnatural unions with human women, and who taught forbidden knowledge. Some are also listed in Book of Raziel (Sefer Raziel HaMalakh), the Zohar, and Jubilees.

* Araqiel (also Arakiel, Araqael, Araciel, Arqael, Sarquael, Arkiel, Arkas) taught humans the signs of the earth. However, in the &quot;Sibylline Oracles&quot;, Araqiel is referred to not as a fallen angel, or watcher, but as one of the five angels who lead the souls of humans to judgment, the other four being Ramiel, Uriel, Samael, and Azazel.
* Armaros (also Amaros or Armoniel) in Enoch I taught humanity the resolving of enchantments.
* Azazel taught humans to make knives, swords, shields, and how to devise ornaments and cosmetics.
* Gadreel (or Gader&#x27;el) taught the art of cosmetics, the use of weapons and killing blows.
* Baraqel (Baraqiel) taught astrology.
* Bezaliel mentioned in Enoch I, left out of most translations because of damaged manuscripts and problematic transmission of the text.
* Chazaqiel (sometimes Ezeqeel or Cambriel) taught humans the signs of the clouds (meteorology).
* Kokabiel (also Kakabel, Kochbiel, Kokbiel, Kabaiel, and Kochab), In the &quot;Book of Raziel&quot; he is a high-ranking, holy angel. In Enoch I, he is a fallen watcher, resident of the nether realms, and commands 365,000 surrogate spirits to do his bidding. Among other duties, he instructs his fellows in astrology.
* Penemue &quot;taught mankind the art of writing with ink and paper,&quot; and taught &quot;the children of men the bitter and the sweet and the secrets of wisdom.&quot; (I Enoch 69.8)
* Sariel (also Suriel) taught humankind about the courses of the moon (at one time regarded as forbidden knowledge).
* Samyaza (also Shemyazaz, Shamazya, Semiaza, Shemhazi, Semyaza and Amezyarak) is one of the leaders of the fall from heaven in &quot;Vocabulaire de l&#x27; Angelologie&quot;.
* Shamsiel, once a guardian of Eden as stated in the &quot;Zohar&quot;, served as one of the two chief aides to the archangel Uriel (the other aide being Hasdiel) when Uriel bore his standard into battle, and is the head of 365 legions of angels and also crowns prayers, accompanying them to the 5th heaven. In &quot;Jubilees&quot;, he is referred to as one of the Watchers. He is a fallen angel who teaches the signs of the sun.
* Yeqon or Jeqon () was the ringleader who first tempted the other Watchers into having sexual relations with humans. His accomplices were Asbeel, Gadreel, Penemue, and Kasdaye (or Kasadya), who were all identified as individual &quot;satans&quot;.

The account of the Book of Enoch has been associated with the passage in Genesis 6:1–4, which speaks of Sons of God instead of Watchers:

=== Second Book of Enoch ===
The Jewish pseudepigraphon Second Book of Enoch (&quot;Slavonic Enoch&quot;) refers to the &quot;Grigori&quot;, who are the same as the Watchers of 1 Enoch. The Slavic word &quot;Grigori&quot; used in the book is a transcription of the Greek word ἐγρήγοροι &quot;egrḗgoroi&quot;, meaning &quot;wakeful&quot;. The Hebrew equivalent is ערים, meaning &quot;waking&quot;, &quot;awake&quot;.

Chapter 18 presents the Grigori as countless soldiers of human appearance, &quot;their size being greater than that of great giants&quot;. They are located in the fifth heaven and identified as &quot;the Grigori, who with their prince Satanail rejected the Lord of light&quot;. One version of 2 Enoch adds that their number was 200 myriads (2 million). Furthermore, some &quot;went down on to earth from the Lord&#x27;s throne&quot; and there married women and &quot;befouled the earth with their deeds&quot;, resulting in confinement underground. The number of those who descended to earth is generally put at three, but Andrei A. Orlov, while quoting the text as saying three, remarks in a footnote that some manuscripts put them at 200 or even 200 myriads.

Chapter 29, referring to the second day of creation, before the creation of human beings, says that &quot;one from out the order of angels&quot; or, according to other versions of 2 Enoch, &quot;one of the order of archangels&quot; or &quot;one of the ranks of the archangels&quot; &quot;conceived an impossible thought, to place his throne higher than the clouds above the earth, that he might become equal in rank to [the Lord&#x27;s] power. And [the Lord] threw him out from the height with his angels, and he was flying in the air continuously above the bottomless.&quot; Although in this chapter the name &quot;Satanail&quot; is mentioned only in a heading added in one manuscript, this chapter too is often understood to refer to Satanail and his angels, the Grigori.

The &quot;Mercer Dictionary of the Bible&quot; makes a distinction between the Grigori and the fallen angels by stating that in fifth heaven, Enoch sees &quot;the giants whose brothers were the fallen angels.&quot;

The longer recension of 2 Enoch 18:3 identifies the prisoners of second heaven as the angels of Satanail.

== Other sources and traditions ==

=== The Book of Giants ===
The story of the Watchers is shown also in The Book of Giants.

=== The Book of Jubilees ===
The term &quot;Watchers&quot; occurs in The Book of Jubilees (Jub. 4:15, 5:1).

=== Damascus Document ===
A reference to the &quot;fall of the watchers from heaven&quot; is found in Hebrew in the Damascus Document 2:18 echoing 1 Enoch 13:10.

=== First Epistle to the Corinthians ===
First Corinthians 11:10 (&quot;For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels&quot;), according to the early Church Father Tertullian, refers to the Watchers. He taught that the lust of the Watchers was the reason for Saint Paul&#x27;s directive to Christian women to wear a headcovering. Tertullian referenced the case of a woman who was touched on the neck by an angel &quot;who found her to be a temptation&quot;.

=== Philo of Byblos ===
According to &quot;PrEv&quot; 1.10.1-2 of Philo of Byblos, Sanchuniathon mentioned &quot;some living beings who had no perception, out of whom intelligent beings came into existence, and they were called &quot;Zophasemin&quot; (Heb. &quot;șōpē-šāmayim&quot;, that is, &#x27;Watchers of Heaven&#x27;). And they were formed like the shape of an egg.&quot;

=== Kabbalah ===
The Zohar makes reference to the &quot;watchers&quot; of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s dream.

=== Possible Babylonian/Aramaic origin ===
According to Jonathan Ben-Dov of the University of Haifa, the myth of the watchers began in Lebanon when Aramaic writers tried to interpret the imagery on Mesopotamian stone monuments without being able to read their Akkadian text.

Amar Annus from the University of Tartu argues that the Watchers were intended as polemical representations of the Mesopotamian Apkallu, who gave wisdom to man before the Flood (which is portrayed as a corrupting influence in Enochian literature).

== Depictions in popular culture ==
There have been many different depictions of the Grigori in fiction and wider popular culture.

In Kevin Smith&#x27;s 1999 religious satire &quot;Dogma&quot;, the character Bartleby (played by Ben Affleck) is mentioned to have formerly been a Watcher.

In Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s 2014 Biblical epic &quot;Noah&quot;, there are a large number of Watchers and they are depicted as having been cast out of Heaven after deciding to help mankind.

In Traci Harding&#x27;s book &quot;The Cosmic Logos,&quot; the Grigori are a group of fallen spiritual beings who watched over and assisted human spiritual evolution thus gaining the title &quot;the Watchers&quot;.

Looking in on us from way out there, the protagonist of the 1972 Hawkwind song &quot;The Watcher&quot; feels his &quot;sense all disgusted:&quot; although man had the chance to do the right thing, &quot;avarice destroyed your sphere.&quot; Convinced once more that we cannot be trusted as custodians of this world, the Watcher proclaims our fearful end.

In the &quot;Supernatural&quot; season 10 episode &quot;Angel Heart&quot; mentions the Grigori with one, Tamiel (under the name &quot;Peter Holloway&quot;) appearing as the main enemy of the episode. At one point in this episode, a picture is shown that is implied to be a painting of a grigori—it is, in fact, a classic depiction of the archangel Michael besting Satan.

In the popular &quot;The Black Tapes&quot; podcast, Grigori are mentioned in Episode 105 titled &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;.

In his Sigma Force novel &quot;The Bone Labyrinth&quot; (2015), James Rollins describes Atlantis&#x27; creators as Watchers, a superior hybrid species of early humans and neanderthals who disseminated knowledge and possibly interbred with people throughout the world. They also created the protected, hidden city of Atlantis, located in Ecuador.

In Lauren Kate&#x27;s book &quot;Fallen,&quot; a group called &#x27;The Watchers&#x27; studied angels who consorted with mortal women, but more closely, Daniel Grigori the sixth archangel.

In Darynda Jones&#x27; &quot;Charley Davidson&quot; series, Sean Foster is identified as nephilim, &quot;part human, part angel ... descended from the union of a grigori and a human.&quot; (&quot;Eleventh Grave in Moonlight&quot;, 2017)

In Ichiei Ishibumi&#x27;s Japanese light novel series &quot;High School DxD&quot;, the Grigori is an organisation of fallen angels, the leaders of which are some of the Watchers named in the Book of Enoch. Three of them play important roles in the story Azazel is the Governor General of Grigori and becomes a major supporting character, Kokabiel is the main antagonist of Volume 3 and Baraqiel is the estranged father of Akeno Himejima, one of the main characters.

In &quot;El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron&quot;, many members of the Grigori are shown throughout the game as the main antagonists. To name a few: Azazel, Armaros, Arakiel, Baraqiel, and Semyaza.

In the English localization of the first &quot;Drakengard&quot; game, the overarching antagonists are semi-divine beings called &quot;the Watchers.&quot; Though the game sometimes refers to them as &quot;daemons,&quot; in the original Japanese text they are simply called angels. The English localization for the prequel, &quot;Drakengard 3&quot;, calls them angels as well.

In the original &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Dogma&quot;, the dragon is called Grigori.

In &quot;City of Angels&quot;, Nicolas Cage plays a watcher angel who falls in love with a human woman, Meg Ryan.

<text>The Pyramid Rock Festival was an Australian New Year&#x27;s Eve camp-out rock music festival at Ventnor on Phillip Island. The original festival in 2004 was organised by local resident, Angus Cameron, and his two cousins.

==History==
Beginning as a single day, from its second year it was run over two nights with two stages – the Main Stage, and the Pharaoh&#x27;s Annex. The Main Stage hosted the major local and international acts, while the Pharaoh&#x27;s Annex featured lesser-known local acts, and in the later evening, the more dance-oriented acts of the festival. There was also a variety of market stalls. With declining attendees that stemmed from the embarrassing failure at the 2009/2010 festival to perform a New Year countdown and the last-minute cancellation of numerous acts, the festival was shelved for 2013 and as of September that year its promoters were &quot;exploring options for the festival to return in 2014&quot;. As of September 2020 this &#x27;exploration&#x27; had still not resulted in any success.

After almost three days of running as scheduled, three hours before New Year&#x27;s Eve 2009, the festival was hit by a severe electrical storm on Phillip Island, although a much bigger storm hit the Fall&#x27;s Festival that same night, which was incident-free. Organisers and bands in conjunction with security and emergency services personnel decided that moving the acts to the Pharaoh&#x27;s Annex would be unsafe. Attendees who paid $300 for tickets to the event claimed &quot;a lack of communication&quot; left thousands of festival-goers stranded in the pouring rain for hours. Performances by Empire of the Sun, Grinspoon, The Butterfly Effect and Van She were delayed, moved and then abruptly cancelled after the storm damaged lighting and sound equipment on the main stage.

<doc id="1090788" wikidata="Q3685" url="?curid=1090788" title="Calama, Chile">
<text>Calama is a city and commune in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile. It is the capital of El Loa Province, part of the Antofagasta Region. Calama is one of the driest cities in the world with average annual precipitation of just . The River Loa, Chile&#x27;s longest, flows through the city. Calama has a population of 147,886 (2012 census).

The commune also encompasses the Quechua communities of Estación San Pedro, Toconce and Cupo; and the Lickan-antay communities of Taira, Conchi Viejo, Lasana, San Francisco de Chiu Chiu, Aiquina-Turi, and Caspana.

In 2003 the nearby town of Chuquicamata, once the largest open-pit copper mine in the world, was dismantled citing environmental reasons and encroachment from the mine&#x27;s expansion. Residents of Chuquicamata then moved to Calama, away from company-owned residences, to find housing on their own.

==Etymology ==
There are a variety of hypotheses about the origin of the name &quot;Calama,&quot; but the two main accounts suggest that it comes from the Kunza language, spoken in the past by the Lickan-antay, an ethnic group that resides in the El Loa Province.

Hector Pumarino Soto suggests that &quot;Calama&quot; stems from the Kunza word &quot;Ckara-ama,&quot; which means &quot;town in the middle of the water&quot;. Until the middle of the 20th century, the urban site of Calama and the surrounding oasis were flanked by the River Loa on two sides, and the fertile plain and swamps on the other sides, giving the location the appearance of an island in the middle of the desert surrounded completely by water.

Emilio Vaïsse, meanwhile, says that Calama comes from the Kunza word &quot;Ckolama,&quot; which means &quot;place where partridges abound&quot;. This is supposed testimony to the abundance of such a bird, living over everything in the middle of the western swamp sector.

== History ==
=== Prehispanic Era ===
The exact evidence related to the history of Calama does exist, including petroglyphs and the caves of Yalquincha (NE of the city), the chullpas of Topáter (pre-Columbian cemeteries to the east of the city), the Copper Mummy, and other remains in Chuquicamata.

At the intersection of the Camino del Inca (the longitudinal one) and the routes that crossed the coast of the Altiplano, Calama became the main shelter of the Despoblado of Atacama. Their extensive lands for growing corn and alfalfa give testimony of the high capacity to supply food to the troops of Chasquis and to give tribute to the Inca. In fact, when Diego de Almagro, returning from Cusco, passed by the Calama shelter, the natives gave him copper horseshoes, which were made using a mysterious Incan technique used by towns conquered by the Incas. The science of such a technique still has yet to be explained, but the presence of such horseshoes further suggests strong Incan influence in Prehispanic times.

=== Hispanic Era ===

Spanish colonization obviously caused some changes; however, the hostile climate impeded establishment of greater control. These changes influenced the control of trade routes that crossed the desert and communication to the port of Cobija with the deposits of Potosí silver and the cattle farms of Salta and Tucumán. In this sense, Calama continued as a main point of provision for commercial routes. In the 18th century, with the Bourbon Reforms.
Calama was included in maps of the Captaincy General of Chile in the 18th century, depending from the city of Copiapó.

=== Bolivian Republic Era ===
After Bolivia&#x27;s Declaration of Independence (6 August 1825), and with gradual changes in the administration of the territory, Calama remained constituted under the Departamento de Litoral (1829), subdivided in the Provincia de Lamar y la Provincia de Atacama (Cobija being the departmental capital). Calama was an important town in the Atacama Province, through which traveled the weekly mail between Cobija and Salta-Potosí, since 1832. In 1840, the provincial capital transferred from Chiuchiu to Calama, increasing the communication boom.

The border conflicts between Chile and Bolivia did not reach either Calama or the Atacama Province. The greater dispute concentrated in the central prairie and in the coast, where they began to discover rich silver deposits, saltpeter, and guano. The ambiguity that led to the frontier conflicts was the possession of the central plain and the Atacama coast. The environment was made tense when Chilean troops, under the command of colonel Emilio Sotomayor Baeza, invaded the port of Antofagasta on the morning of February 14, 1879. Later, Bolivia declared war on Chile on March 1.

===Chilean Republic Era===

Since that day, the changes in the administration have been very deep. It being part of the administrative center of 2° order in Bolivia, returned as one of 4° order under the Chilean administration (subdelegation). In 1888, under the government of José Manuel Balmaceda, Calama returned as an administrative center of 3° order, inaugurated as the municipality on 13 October. Prior to that, in 1886, Calama was chosen for a railway station of the Antofagasta-Bolivia Railway, which further expedited shipments through Calama.

==Geography and climate==
Calama has two distinct entities: the desert and the Andes Mountain Range. Between , the desert climate (BWk) is characterized by annual precipitation that does not surpass . The average temperature is throughout the year with drastic changes between average daily highs of over and average daily lows below in winter and record highs of over in summer. Light easterly winds are common in the mornings with strong westerly winds in the afternoon.
== Orography ==

The western boundary of the town of Calama is marked by the peaks of the foothills, which occurs north of Calama in the foothills of the Loa River, which has many names, from north to south: Sierra Moreno, Cerros Chuquicamata Cerros de Montecristo. The Cerro Poquis (4,589 m), is the maximum altitude, north of Chuquicamata. South of it begin the foothills of the Cordillera de Domeyko, which in turn serve to chart the southern boundary of the district, with the names of Sierra de Limón Verde and Cordon Barros Arana. The passage of Loa river from east to west leaves a plain, in which the city of Calama and the oasis is located.

==Demographics==

According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Calama has an area of and has 138,402 inhabitants (70,832 men and 67,570 women). Of these, 136,600 (98.7%) lived in urban areas and 1,802 (1.3%) in rural areas. The population grew by 3.6% (16,595 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.

<doc id="1090798" wikidata="Q2185669" url="?curid=1090798" title="Bradwell, Norfolk">
<text>Bradwell is a village and civil parish in the English county of Norfolk. The village is immediately to the west of, and largely indistinguishable from, the built-up urban area of the town of Great Yarmouth.

==History==
Bradwell&#x27;s name is of Anglo-Saxon origin and derives from the Old English for a &#x27;broad spring or stream.&#x27;

Bradwell is not featured in the Domesday Book.

There are numerous listed farm buildings in Bradwell. These include Bradwell Hall (Eighteenth Century) with an accompanying barn, Old Hall Farmhouse (Seventeenth Century) and Church Farmhouse (Eighteenth Century) with an accompanying barn.

During the Second World War, Bradwell was hit by several &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; air raids designed to hit Great Yarmouth, however, the craters from the bomb damage were filled in after 1945. There were also searchlight batteries and pillboxes built in Bradwell during the war.

==Geography==
The civil parish has an area of 9.74 km2 and according to the 2021 census, Bradwell has a population of 11,628 people which shows a large increase from the 10,528 people recorded in the 2011 census. 

The A143, between Gorleston-on-Sea and Haverhill, bisects Bradwell.

== St. Nicholas&#x27; Church ==
Bradwell&#x27;s parish church is dedicated to Saint Nicholas, is located on Church Walk and is also one of the 185 surviving English Round-tower churches, built before the Norman Conquest. The church boasts a Fifteenth Century font which shows clear signs of an iconoclastic attack in the Seventeenth Century.

== Education ==
Bradwell&#x27;s&#x27; schools include: Hillside Primary School, Homefield Church of England Primary and Nursery School, Lynn Grove Academy, Wroughton Academies and Woodlands Primary and Nursery School.

==Parish Council and Local Government==
For the purposes of local government, the parish today falls within the district of Great Yarmouth. However prior to the Local Government Act 1972, the parish was within Lothingland Rural District in Suffolk.

Bradwell Parish Council has responsibility for a number of amenities within the village, and will make representations to the borough council, county council, police and others to secure improvements to services within the village.
Its &#x27;base&#x27; is the Leo Coles Pavilion, located on the Green Lane Playing Field site – its meetings take place there, and the clerk&#x27;s office is situated there.
The council publishes a twice-yearly newspaper, &quot;The Bradwellian&quot;, which is delivered to every household in Bradwell by a team of volunteers.

== Governance ==
Bradenham is part of the electoral ward of Lothingland for local elections and is part of the district of Great Yarmouth.

The village&#x27;s national constituency is Great Yarmouth which has been represented by the Reform UK&#x27;s Rupert Lowe since 2024.

==War memorial==
Bradwell&#x27;s War Memorial is an obelisk made from red granite located on Church Walk. It bears the following names for the First World War and the Russian Civil War:

And, the following for the Second World War:

<doc id="1090805" wikidata="Q7895383" url="?curid=1090805" title="University of Exeter Halls of Residence">
<text>The University of Exeter offers approximately 6,500 purpose-built student bed spaces for its students. The majority of its residences are located on campus, although 30% of self-catered accommodations (particularly for the St Lukes Campus) are located off-campus. 

The first accommodation for students was in the city centre during the first years of the 20th century, and the first purpose-built hall was Mardon Hall, opened in 1933.

==Early history==
The university developed from the 19th century Royal Albert Memorial College, and by 1902 it was apparent that accommodation was needed for the female students with a house in Castle Street being privately run as a hostel for them. In 1906 the city council bought the house, extended it and renamed it as Bradninch Hall. It offered housing for 78 female students and was the college&#x27;s first hall of residence. During the First World War, Bradninch Hall was used as a Red Cross hospital and the students were moved to Hartwell House and two houses in Pennsylvania Road. After being extended in the 1920s, Hartwell House subsequently became Hope Hall, and the Pennsylvania Road properties became Kilmorie Hall.

In 1902, two houses in St. David&#x27;s Hill were leased by the Diocesan Council for Religious Education as a hostel for female students. Known as Sandford Hall, it was taken over by the university college for two years from 1946. In 1904 the college rented a field known as Grâs Lawn in Barrack Road, east of the city centre. The college bought the field in 1912, intending it to be used for a hall of residence for male students, but this never occurred and the land was sold for housing in 1999.

In the early 1920s Reed Hall and two houses in Grendon Road were acquired to accommodate male students. Reed Hall now serves as a wedding and conference venue. 

==Exeter Halls==
The Exeter Halls, on Streatham Campus, are Hope Hall, Lopes Hall, , Pennsylvania Court, Ransom Pickard, as well as formerly Lazenby and Kilmorie Hall. James Owen Court is also a part of Exeter Halls, although it is self catered, and therefore not generally considered. The combined student total is around 700 .

===Hope Hall===
Hope Hall accommodated around 60 students in three converted family homes. Originally opened in 1915 as an all-girls residence and named Hartwell House, it was reopened and renamed as Hope Hall in 1925 by the Duke and Duchess of York after Helena Hope, due to her generous donations. A painting of Helena Hope hangs in the main foyer. The hall was visited by Queen Mary in 1938.

Hope Hall has picturesque grounds that are just across the lawn from Lazenby, which itself accommodated around 18 students. Both buildings have features such as original fireplaces, antique wall hangings and ceiling decorations.

Containing a TV room, laundry facilities and a bar called &#x27;The Badger&#x27; (in use intermittently ), the hall was a catered residence with a small kitchenette on each floor. It had until recently, an operating dining room in which its annexe buildings, Lazenby, Byrne House (formerly Montefiore, now office space for Egenis, the Centre for the Study of Life Sciences) and Spreytonway (now derelict), all dined in. Now the room is used as a social space, in particular for dance societies.

In 2013, Hope Hall and Lazenby were both refurbished to provide additional office and research space for university staff. As of 2014, Hope Hall accommodates research and administrative staff from the College of Engineering, Mathematics and Physical Sciences, postgraduate students of the Business School and the Health, Safety and Environment Office. The Badger Bar in Hope Hall remains as a social and networking space and the dining room is an open plan office for the business school.

Similar plans to convert Spreytonway have been shelved for financial reasons. The building is in a deteriorating state - as of 2015 the glass has been removed from the verandas for safety, slates have slipped from the roof and the plaster on lath ceiling has collapsed in one upstairs room visible through a window. Services have been switched off. Spreytonway&#x27;s yard and outbuildings remain in use by the grounds maintenance team and as parking for the university&#x27;s minibus fleet. Spreytonway is a locally listed building and is classified as having a positive contribution to townscape in the university&#x27;s 2010 Streatham Campus Master Plan Framework.

===Lopes Hall===
Lopes (pronounced &quot;Lopez&quot;) Hall was originally a large Victorian Gothic villa known as &quot;Highlands&quot;, built in 1866. After the university bought it and the surrounding seven acres of land in 1930, the architect E. Vincent Harris added a brick Queen Anne-style extension and it was opened by United States Ambassador Robert Bingham in October 1933, for women students only. It is named after Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Roborough who was president of the college.

Today Lopes Hall consists of a main building with 57 standard rooms, and contains the main Exeter Halls reception, a common room, laundry facilities, study room and library. The main building consists of the Old House (Nunnery) and the Main Wing. It now houses around 100, both male and female first year students with shared bathrooms and spacious rooms.

===Pennsylvania Court===
Pennsylvania Court (Penny C) was finished in 2004. In contrast to the traditional appearance of the rest of Exeter Halls, Pennsylvania Court is more modern, in both its appearance and facilities. It contains 4-star en-suite accommodation including balconies, heated towel rails and double beds. Housing around 180 students, Pennsylvania Court is generally the most oversubscribed hall on campus.

===Ransom Pickard===
Ransom Pickard was built in the 1960s, but completely refurbished in 2008. Ransom Pickard is separated into two blocks, A and B, joined by a central staircase. These two blocks are in turn separated into three floors, each of which has space for 16 people. There are four double rooms to a floor and eight single rooms. Ransom Pickard has single beds, a desk, wardrobe and sink to each room and since the refurbishment now falls under the category of &#x27;single enhanced&#x27; in terms of accommodation.

== Birks Grange ==
In 2005, Birks Grange, formerly Birks Halls (1966–2004), completed a multimillion-pound redevelopment with the residential block being completely rebuilt and the central block being redesigned and renovated. The central block was equipped with a new porter&#x27;s lodge, a modern canteen and a renovated hall bar named &#x27;The Boot&#x27;, and a shop. Birks Grange has accessible rooms for people with disabilities. 

Birks Grange now encompasses Moberly House (standard rooms), and together make up the largest hall in the University of Exeter with 360 undergraduates in Birks Grange and 152 in Moberly. The colours for Birks Grange is blue, whilst that of Moberly House is green. The main motto is &quot;Together we stand&quot;, whilst each hall has a slogan that identifies itself. The informal slogan for Birks Grange is currently &quot;Best legs on Campus&quot; - due to Cardiac Hill, the steep path leading up from Birks Grange to the campus. The motto for Birks is &quot;Excelsior&quot; (Ever Upward), and the informal slogan for Moberly House is &quot;Last one standing&quot;, which refers to the last remaining hall of the recently demolished Duryard Halls.

=== Birks Grange Village ===
Building works were completed in September 2011 providing en-suite, enhanced and studio self-catered accommodation on the hills opposite Birks Grange and the green area between the central block and the catered blocks to accommodate for more than 800 students. The halls have collectively become known as Birks Grange Village. The university hopes that these brand new halls will enable them to increase student intake, and thus maintain the institution&#x27;s 9th-place ranking within the country.
==Holland Hall==
Holland Hall is named after Sir Geoffrey Holland, the Vice-Chancellor of the university who retired in 2002. It opened in September 2004, and features both catered rooms and studios.

The hall has rooms for 406 undergraduates and has a restaurant that seats 360. It is on the north-east side of Streatham Campus and has good views over the River Exe. The accommodation is utilised as a hotel during non term time, particularly by guests to conferences or events on campus.

==Mardon Hall==
, Mardon Hall provides accommodation for a total of 106 students in 48 single rooms and 29 shared rooms, with shared bathroom facilities.

Designed in a &#x27;country house&#x27; style by E. Vincent Harris, Mardon Hall opened in 1933, and was extensively refurbished in 1996, but retains its wood-panelled library and grand staircase. It was the University College of the South West&#x27;s first purpose-built hall of residence. This was 22 years before the university gained its charter, becoming the University of Exeter in 1955.

Mardon Hall was financed by the College Appeal and Flight Lieutenant Evelyn Mardon, who donated £25,000 towards the building cost and after whom it was named. One of the original notable features of Mardon Hall was the wooden hut that was used as a dining hall until shortly after Holland Hall was built, due to the University College&#x27;s lack of funds at the time of Mardon&#x27;s construction.

In early planning against the outbreak of war the Government indicated a wish to use Mardon Hall as a hospital, but it continued as student accommodation until 1943, when it was taken over by the American Red Cross as a rest centre and Psychological Hospital for American troops. A wartime German map, held by the Devon Record Office, has the adjacent Reed Hall and the university&#x27;s Washington Singer Laboratories marked as military targets, but not Mardon. The Hall was returned to student use in 1945.

During the 1970s, the Warden was the charming eccentric Dr FR Oliver MA DPhil, who was awarded &#x27;the most boring lecturer in the UK&#x27; by Radio 4 on several occasions for his lecture &#x27;The correlation coefficient&#x27; for first-year economics students.

The Hall accommodated men only until women were admitted in 1986, when &quot;too many&quot; women applied for University accommodation, but &quot;not enough&quot; Mardon Bar was known as &quot;The Beaver&quot;, although it has been out of action since 2007. 


==Self-catered accommodation==
The original Lafrowda flats that were built in 1971 and 1976 were sold to the University Partnership Programme (UPP) in 2009 and are being demolished. Four new accommodation blocks are intended to be available by September 2011 with a further three blocks due for completion the following year, providing a total of 921 residences.

Llewellyn Mews is self-catered accommodation situated just off-campus on King Edward Street. Like Birks Grange, residents use Cardiac Hill to get to campus.

East Park is the newest self-catered accommodation, with construction completed in 2021. There are 270 standard bedrooms, and 912 en-suites. Students access campus via Forum Hill.

Other self-catered residences both on- and off-campus include Bonhay House, Clydesdale Court, Clydesdale Rise, James Owen Court, King Edward Court, King Edward Studio, Nash Grove, St Germans (University owned), Rowe House (University owned), Point Exe (Signpost Homes), Northernhay, and Northfield (UNITE)

==St Luke&#x27;s Campus and Rowancroft==
Consisting of College House, South Cloisters, New Nancherrow and Old Nancherrow, all accommodation on St Luke&#x27;s Campus shares a single halls committee, and is often considered as simply &quot;St Luke&#x27;s halls&quot; by non-residents.

As of 2011, Rowancroft consists of a total of 386 places in various self-catered accommodation on sites to the east of the city centre, close to St Luke&#x27;s Campus and the suburb of Heavitree. The residences are shared between undergraduates and postgraduates.

==Penryn Campus==
Penryn Campus near Penryn in Cornwall contains Glasney Student Village and nearby is The Sidings, opened in September 2012. Former halls were Beringer House and MacWilliam which were halls of residence for fresher and graduate students respectively at the Camborne School of Mines in Camborne, until the school moved in 2004. Beringer House was a two-storey building constructed from Cornish granite and concrete and was named after one of the school&#x27;s founders, J Beringer.

==Former halls==
===Thomas Hall===
Thomas Hall has not been used as a hall of residence since 2002/2003. The hall was built as Great Duryard House in about 1690 by Sir Thomas Jefford, mayor of Exeter. The Manor of Duryard was originally owned by the city of Exeter, but was sold off in the 17th century. Inside the hall is linenfold panelling said to have come from Exeter Guildhall. In 1936 it was renamed Thomas Hall after Charles Vivian Thomas, a Cornish businessman who helped fund its transfer to the university.

Originally providing accommodation for male students, during the early part of World War II it was used for the students of the Royal Free Hospital Medical School who were evacuated to the city. After the war it was a hall for female students. In July 2013, the new Exeter Steiner Academy announced that it had secured the purchase of the hall for use as its permanent school premises from 2015.

===Duryard Halls===
Duryard Halls provided accommodation from 1964 until 2007, latterly for around 650 students. These halls were the residence of Harry Potter author JK Rowling, as well as pop singer and winner of Pop Idol Will Young and actor Adam Campbell, who shared a room in Hetherington House.

Duryard Halls were spread over four houses, surrounding the old Duryard House and its drive: Moberly named after Walter Hamilton Moberly; Murray, named after John Murray; Hetherington, named after Hector Hetherington; and Jessie Montgomery. In 2007 demolition work started on all the halls, except for Moberly and the grade II listed Duryard House, with the intention of providing seven new accommodation blocks to house 630 students.

Moberly Hall fell out of use in the academic year 2012/13, although was re-occupied in 2014/15.

Part of Jessie Montgomery hall remains as the Grade II listed stable block, which was used as a site office accommodation during the construction of the new UPP and INTO halls of residence and is now used as storage.

The central block has undergone a deep refurbishment as a music facility and is known as Kay House. Together with Cornwall House on the main part of the campus, it formed a test bed for the retrofitting of external wall insulation to improve its thermal efficiency.

The new halls are operated by INTO (Avon, Bovey, Dart and Exe halls, along with the listed Duryard House which is used as a social space and offices) and UPP (Teign and Yeo).

===Crossmead Hall===
Crossmead was located across the river at the top of Dunsford Hill. In the 1980s the lower part of the grounds on the corner of Barley Lane and Dunsford Hill was developed as Cadogan Court, a nursing home. Crossmead was closed as a hall and used by the university as a conference centre. This closed in 2006. There was controversy in autumn 2005 when the university applied to build 36 flats and 54 houses on the site; proposals that were bitterly opposed by the local residents.

<doc id="1090808" wikidata="Q2736108" url="?curid=1090808" title="Musō Shinden-ryū">
<text>is a style of sword-drawing art (&quot;iaido&quot;) founded by Nakayama Hakudō (中山博道) in 1932. Nakayama Hakudō studied under Hosokawa Yoshimasa, a master of the &quot;Shimomura&quot; branch (下村派) of Hasegawa Eishin-ryū, and Morimoto Tokumi, a fellow student of Ōe Masaji of the &quot;Tanimura&quot; branch (谷村派). The name Musō Shinden-ryū most likely comes from the name given to the &quot;Shimomura&quot; branch by Hosokawa, Musō Shinden Eishin-ryū (無雙神傳英信流).

==Particularities==
The &quot;kata&quot; from Musō Shinden-ryū have a number of differences from the &quot;kata&quot; of its sister art, Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū. Among the most visible are the manner in which the &quot;furikaburi&quot; (raising the sword overhead, sometimes called &quot;furikamuri&quot;) and the &quot;nōtō&quot; (sheathing) are done. Both arts also differ from many other &quot;iaijutsu&quot; schools in that the &quot;kiai&quot; is performed silently, without &quot;hassei&quot; (shouting).

===Furikaburi===
After striking with one hand, primarily on &quot;nukitsuke&quot; (cutting as one draws the sword out), the sword is brought to a position about ten centimeters above the left shoulder, blade edge up, and with the point facing backwards. The movement resembles a thrust to the rear. Unlike in Musō Jikiden Eishin-ryū, the sword does not fall off behind the back but always stays over shoulder height. The right hand then raises the sword overhead while the left hand takes its place on the hilt, thus entering in the &quot;jōdan&quot; stance or &quot;kamae&quot;. The sword should now be right in the middle line of the body, with the tip raised forty-five degrees upward (Chuden) or level with the ground (Shoden) and your left hand hovering just above your forehead.

===Nōtō===
In Musō Shinden-ryū, the sheathing is performed horizontally with the blade outwards. Only when the sword is about two-thirds of the way in the &quot;saya&quot; is the edge turned to face upwards. The blade and &quot;saya&quot; should cross your center line at a 45-degree angle while sheathing.

==Techniques==

===Shoden (初伝)===
The word &quot;Shoden&quot;, which can be translated as the &quot;first transmission&quot;, consists of the &quot;kata&quot; of Ōmori-ryū iaijutsu plus one &quot;kata&quot; variation exclusive to Musō Shinden-ryū. The &quot;kata&quot; start from the &quot;seiza&quot; sitting posture. This series of &quot;kata&quot; became the first to be learned when the 17th headmaster of the Tanimura branch, Ōe Masamichi, reorganized and rationalized the curriculum of Hasegawa Eishin-ryū at the start of the 20th century. The kata &quot;Ryūtō&quot;, which involves the &quot;Ukenagashi&quot; technique, is often considered as the most difficult kata of the Omori set. The seventh kata, &quot;Juntō&quot; was created neither for dueling nor for self-defense, but to serve as &quot;kaishakunin&quot;.

According to his own memoirs, Nakayama Hakudō invented the twelfth &quot;kata&quot;, &quot;In&#x27;yō Shintai Kaewaza&quot;, as a variation on the fifth kata &quot;In&#x27;yō Shintai&quot;.

The following is the order given by Yamatsuta. In some schools, the order of the last two &quot;kata&quot; are reversed.

* 01. Shohattō (初発刀)
* 02. Satō (左刀)
* 03. Utō (右刀)
* 04. Ataritō (当刀)
* 05. In&#x27;yō Shintai (陰陽進退)
* 06. Ryūtō (流刀)
* 07. Juntō (順刀)
* 08. Gyakutō (逆刀)
* 09. Seichūtō (勢中刀)
* 10. Korantō (虎乱刀)
* 11. In&#x27;yō Shintai Kaewaza (陰陽進退替業)
* 12. Battō (抜刀)

===Chūden (中伝)===
The word &quot;Chūden&quot; can be translated as the &quot;middle-transmission&quot; and consists of ten techniques from Hasegawa Eishin-ryū. This series of &quot;kata&quot; is executed from the &quot;tachihiza&quot; (more commonly called &quot;tatehiza&quot;) sitting position. In contrast to the first series of &quot;kata&quot;, the enemy is considered to be sitting very close and thus the primary goal of the chūden techniques is to create proper cutting distance (&quot;kirima&quot;) by stepping back instead of forward.

Ōe Masamichi is credited with developing the &quot;hayanuki&quot; (quick draw) exercise. In this style of training, the practitioner executes all ten techniques in a row. Two versions of &quot;hayanuki&quot; exist. In one version, both the left and right hands are used to execute the movements, just as in the normal practice. The second version involves drawing the sword with only the right hand, as if you were on a horse. This kind of practice is not done in formal presentations.

* 01. Yokogumo (横雲)
* 02. Toraissoku (虎一足)
* 03. Inazuma (稲妻)
* 04. Ukigumo (浮雲)
* 05. Yamaoroshi (山颪)
* 06. Iwanami (岩浪)
* 07. Urokogaeshi (鱗返)
* 08. Namigaeshi (浪返)
* 09. Takiotoshi (滝落)
* 10. Nukiuchi (抜打)

===Okuden (奥伝)===
The word &quot;Okuden&quot; can be translated as the &quot;inner transmission&quot;. &quot;Oku-iai&quot;, as it is also called, is divided into two groups: &quot;suwari-waza&quot; (sitting techniques) and &quot;tachi-waza&quot; (standing techniques). As in &quot;Chūden&quot;, the sitting techniques are performed from &quot;tatehiza&quot;.

Suwari-waza (座業) 
* 01. Kasumi (霞) – Mist
* 02. Sunegakoi (脛囲) – Covering the shin
* 03. Shihogiri (四方切) – Cutting four corners
* 04. Tozume (戸詰) – Across the screen doors
* 05. Towaki (戸脇) – Along the screen doors
* 06. Tanashita (棚下) – Under the shelf
* 07. Ryozume (両詰) – Obstacles on both sides
* 08. Torabashiiri (虎走) – Running Tiger
* 09. *Itomagoi (暇乞) – Request Leave of Absence [Three forms]
* Despite the fact to be a sitting-form, in an &quot;Enbu&quot; the &quot;Itomagoi&quot; form is usually performed after the execution of all standing forms so the &quot;kenshi&quot; is ready to begin the finishing &quot;reiho,&quot; like &quot;Battô&quot; in &quot;Omori-ryu&quot; and &quot;Nukiuchi&quot; in &quot;Hasegawa Eishin Ryu.&quot;

Tachi-waza (立業)
* 01. Yukitsure (行連) – Escort
* 02. Rentatsu (連達) – Escort
* 03. Somakuri (惣捲) – Cutting the multiple opponents
* 04. Sodome (総留) – One-handed cuts
* 05. Shinobu (信夫) – Stealth
* 06. Yukichigai (行違) – Passing by
* 07. Sodesurigaeshi (袖摺返) – Flipping the sleeves
* 08. Moniri (門入) – Entering the gate
* 09. Kabezoi (壁添) – Along the walls
* 10. Ukenagashi (受流) – Block and deflect
* 11. *Oikakegiri (追掛斬) – Pursue &amp; Cut Down 
* 12. Ryoushihikitsure (両士引連) – Accompanied Journey 
* This is believed to be a kata that Oe Masamichi &quot;Sensei&quot; discarded when he re-organized the old tradition. It is generally not performed.

===Kumitachi===

The paired Kumitachi techniques (the &quot;kenjutsu&quot; part of the curriculum) are rarely taught today. Tachi Uchi-no-Kurai and Tsumeiai-no-Kurai are the series most often taught.

Tachi Uchi-no-Kurai (太刀打之位)

* 2. Tsukekomi (附込)
* 3. Ukenagashi (請流)
* 4. Ukeire (請入)
* 5. Tsukikage (月影)
* 6. Suigetsutō (水月刀)
* 7. Dokumyōken (独妙剣)
* 8. Zetsumyōken (絶妙剣)
* 9. Shinmyōken (心明剣)
* 10. Uchikomi (打込)

<doc id="1090810" wikidata="Q6686616" url="?curid=1090810" title="Louis Alterie">
<text>Louis &quot;Two Gun&quot; Alterie (August 2, 1886 – July 18, 1935), born Leland A. Varain, and aka &quot;Diamond Jack Alterie&quot;, was a Californian who became a notorious hitman for the Chicago North Side Gang during the early years of Prohibition.

==Early years==
Alterie was born Leland A. Varain in Northern California on August 2, 1886. He moved to Chicago as a young man, and eventually joined the predominantly Irish North Side Gang, which was headed by Dean O&#x27;Banion. Befitting his California background, Alterie was a Western enthusiast who wore a ten-gallon hat and two holstered Colt .45 revolvers and owned a ranch near Sedalia, Colorado. As well as being a top gunman for the North Side Gang, he also formed the Theatrical Janitors&#x27; Union and used his position as union president to extort money from theater owners.

==Gang war with Chicago Outfit==
In the early 1920s, the North Side Gang&#x27;s greatest rival was the Chicago Outfit, run first by John &quot;The Fox&quot; Torrio and then Al Capone. During this period a series of disputes over bootlegging territories and other matters led the North Siders into conflict with the Outfit and its allies, the Genna brothers of Little Italy. Alterie by some reports killed more than 20 Outfit and Genna gang members during this conflict which had erupted into a full-scale gang war in 1924 when O&#x27;Banion was murdered by Outfit gunmen in his floral shop on State Street in Chicago.

==Exile to Colorado==
Alterie was considered the &quot;flake&quot; of the O&#x27;Banion gang. He once feigned insanity prior to a murder trial to give his criminal associates time to kill or intimidate witnesses. His act was so convincing that many considered him actually insane.

Incensed by O&#x27;Banion&#x27;s murder, Alterie publicly challenged his killers to a shootout on State Street. However, cooler heads within the North Side Gang were upset by Alterie&#x27;s bravado; they worried that this would result in unwanted attention from both rival gangs and Chicago officials. Moran convinced Alterie to leave Chicago until it was safe to return.

Alterie chose to go to his Moonridge ranch in Colorado. However, he soon attracted unwanted attention from the Colorado authorities. In November 1932, Alterie was involved in a gangland shooting in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. In February 1933, as part of a sentencing agreement, Alterie agreed to leave Colorado and not come back for a period of five years. At this point, Alterie returned to Chicago. Over the next few years, he briefly returned to Colorado several times, but kept his residence in Chicago.

==Return to Chicago and death==
During Alterie&#x27;s absence from Chicago, the gang war between the North Side Gang and the Chicago Outfit continued. In 1929, the Outfit had killed seven North Side gang members in the infamous St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre. The Chicago Outfit was now in charge.

Other than a vagrancy arrest in Chicago in 1933, Alterie kept a low profile. However, that changed in June 1935 when he was forced to testify against Ralph &quot;Bottles&quot; Capone, Al Capone&#x27;s brother, on a tax evasion charge. Louis Alterie was killed on July 18, 1935, while leaving his North Side Chicago apartment. Ironically, Alterie was shot by snipers lying in wait for him across from his apartment, using a technique Alterie had pioneered during Prohibition.

The lead story in that afternoon&#x27;s Chicago Daily News, written by Robert J. Casey, began: &quot;&#x27;Two-Gun Louie&#x27;&quot; Alterie came out of the shadows of the alky racket long enough to die. He was shot down—in the technique he himself had done so much to perfect.&quot; A sidebar by Clem Lane, a legendary city editor, began: &quot;This is the story of &#x27;Two-Gun Louie&#x27; Alterie, one-time pugilist, one-time policeman, one-time robber, one-time lieutenant of Johnny Torrio and Dion O&#x27;Banion, erstwhile rancher and union business agent, and today the subject of a coroner&#x27;s inquest as to who shot him and why not sooner.&quot;

He was buried in an unmarked grave in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

<doc id="1090811" wikidata="Q2640138" url="?curid=1090811" title="Royal University of Bhutan">
<text>The Royal University of Bhutan (Dzongkha: འབྲུག་རྒྱལ་འཛིན་གཙུག་ལག་སློབ་སྡེ་; Wylie:&quot; &#x27;brug rgyal-&#x27;dzin gtsug-lag-slob-sde&quot;), founded on June 2, 2003, by a royal decree, is the national university of Bhutan. It is the first and the oldest university in Bhutan.

==Colleges==
The university was established to consolidate the management of tertiary education in Bhutan. It is a decentralized university with nine constituent colleges and two affiliated college spread across the kingdom. The principle which influenced the development of a university system was the government&#x27;s priority for equitable development. The colleges of the university are:
* College of Natural Resources (CNR) in Lobesa, Punakha
* College of Science and Technology (CST) in Rinchhending, Phuntsholing
* Gaeddu College of Business Studies (GCBS) in Gedu, Chukha
* College of Language and Culture Studies (CLCS) in Taktse, Trongsa.
* Jigme Namgyel Engineering College (JNEC) in Dewathang, Samdrup Jongkhar
* Paro College of Education (PCE) in Paro
* Royal Thimphu College (RTC) in Ngabiphu, Thimphu (affiliated college) 
* Norbuling Righter College, paro (affiliated college)
* Samtse College of Education (SCE) in Samtse
* Sherubtse College in Kanglung, Trashigang
* Gyalpozhing College of Information Technology in Chamjekha, Thimphu

The university maintains a connection with other universities which include the University of New Brunswick in Canada, Naropa University and the School for International Training in the United States, the University of Salzburg in Austria, and the University of Delhi in India, in the areas of research, student exchange and internship programs for students and faculty.

Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, the fifth king of Bhutan, is the chancellor. His Majesty The King appointed Chewang Rinzin as the Vice Chancellor of the Royal University of Bhutan on 20th December, 2024.

The Centre for Bhutan Studies (CBS) in Thimphu, originally slated to become a member institution of the university, has retained its autonomous status.

==Administration==
Based on the distributed model with campuses of the colleges forming the core element of the university, the office of the vice-chancellor at the center is responsible for central coordination while the constituent member colleges look after academic functions of teaching and research within their respective colleges. Located at Mothithang, Thimphu, the office of the vice-chancellor consists of the departments of registry, academic affairs, planning and resources, and research and external relations.

The twofold objective of the university as stated in the royal charter (RUB 2003, p. 3) is to develop and provide programmes of study at tertiary education level, of relevance and good quality which will fulfill the needs of the country for an educated and skilled population; and to promote and conduct research, to contribute to the creation of knowledge in an international context and to promote the transfer of knowledge of relevance to Bhutan.

==Programmes==
The Royal University of Bhutan offers programmes across its campuses in eight broad curriculum areas. These include:
*teacher education
*business and management
*engineering and physical sciences
*computing and information science
*biological sciences and agriculture
*health sciences
*humanities and social sciences
*Dzongkha language and literature

There are plans to include programmes in arts and design, media and mass communication, Bhutanese history and culture, gross national happiness, counseling and Buddhist studies in the colleges.

Most programmes are full-time, although the two colleges of education, Sherubtse College, and the Institute of Language and Culture Studies, offer part-time and distance education programmes. Some programmes offered at Sherubtse College provide their students with freedom to cross departmental boundaries with double degree programmes.

The university offers diploma, degree, and honours degree courses of study.

===Diploma===
The diploma programme consists of 240 credits out of which at least 100 credits are at second year degree level. The programme usually takes over two years of full-time study, or more, if it consists of more than 120 credits.

The diploma may be an interim award in a degree programme, in which case the programme aims to prepare diploma graduates for employment as well as to prepare them to progress to the award of a degree. The diploma may also be an award for an entirely free standing programme unrelated to a degree programme, in which case the programme aims at every specific employment or skills-based target.

===Degree===
The degree programme consists of 360 credits, out of which at least 90 shall be at third year level. The degree programme usually takes over three years of full-time study, or more, if it consists of more than 360 credits.

===Honours degree===
The honours degree supplements and develops the subject matter learned from the degree to a higher level. It includes a project, emphasizes students&#x27; self study and prepares them for postgraduate study. The honours degree consists of 480 credits, out of which at least 90 credits are at fourth year level. The honours degree usually takes over four years of full-time study, with the inclusion of the degree programme of 360 credits included.

Students across the colleges have opportunities to partake in activities from study of their programmes and community service to a range of extracurricular activities.

<text>Ancud () is a city in southern Chile located in the northernmost part of the island and province of Chiloé, in Los Lagos Region. It is the second largest city of Chiloé Archipelago after Castro. The city was established in 1768 to function as the capital of the archipelago and held that position until 1982. Founded as bulwark against foreign powers in colonial times, the city played an important role in the Chilean colonization of Patagonia in the 19th century.

==Geography==
Numerous glaciations have dredged the Chacao Channel to the north, separating Chiloé Island from mainland Chile to the north, marking the border between two natural regions of Chile, Zona Sur to the north and Zona Austral to the south. The Pacific Ocean lies on the west as the Chilean Coastal Range continues as a chain of islands. To the southeast of the commune is Quemchi and Dalcahue to the south. The commune has a surface area of . To the west are the coastal villages of Pumillahue and Quetalmahue, among others. 25 kilometers west of Ancud lies Islotes de Puñihuil Natural Monument, a group of preserved islands that provide habitat to various penguin species.

==History==
Prior to its establishment as a Spanish settlement the site of Ancud was known as Puerto Inglés (lit. English port). It was on here that Hendrik Brouwer, the leader of the Dutch expedition to Valdivia died on August 7, 1643, before reaching Valdivia.

As consequence of the Seven Years&#x27; War the Spanish authorities had the coastal fortification system of Chile updated and expanded. Inspired in the recommendations of former governor Antonio Narciso de Santa María, the Spanish founded the &quot;city-fort&quot; of Ancud in 1767–1768 and separated Chiloé from the Captaincy General of Chile into a direct dependency of the Viceroyalty of Peru. As with other 18th-century forts in Chile, the establishment of Ancud led through the new Ancud-Castro road to an expansion on local trade and agriculture.

Between 1839 and 1864 the Chilean Navy ran the Ancud Nautical School () in the town. Among its alumni was Francisco Hudson.

==Climate==
Ancud has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) with significant precipitation in each month. Winters are cool and wet with a July average of . Precipitation during this time of the year is very high, averaging around and humidity is high, averaging around 87-88%. Summers are mild with a January average of and during this time, precipitation is lower though still significant, averaging in January. Temperatures rarely exceed . The average annual precipitation is and there are 200 days with measureable precipitation. However, precipitation is highly variable from year to year with 1993 being the driest, recording only and 1977 being the wettest at . The record high was on January 27, 1975, and the record low was on June 30, 1970.

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Ancud spans an area of and has 39,946 inhabitants (19,793 men and 20,153 women). Of these, 27,292 (68.3%) lived in urban areas and 12,654 (31.7%) in rural areas. The population grew by 6.5% (2,430 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The demonym of a person from Ancud is &quot;Ancuditano&quot; for a man and &quot;Ancuditana&quot; for a woman.

==Administration==
As a commune, Ancud is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Federico Krüger Finterbüch.

Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Ancud is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Mr. Gabriel Ascencio (PDC) and Mr. Alejandro Santana (RN) as part of the 58th electoral district, together with Castro, Quemchi, Dalcahue, Curaco de Vélez, Quinchao, Puqueldón, Chonchi, Queilén, Quellón, Chaitén, Hualaihué, Futaleufú and Palena. The commune is represented in the Senate by Camilo Escalona Medina (PS) and Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).

==Education==
Previously the area had a German school, Deutsche Schule Ancud-Chiloe.

==Landmarks==
===Cathedral===

The Cathedral of Ancud is the main religious temple of the city, and it is a building built after the 1960 earthquake, in the same place as the temple destroyed during that event.

===Colonial fort system===
The fort system of Ancud together with nearby the forts of Agüi one of the four fort systems that existed in colonial Chiloé. The fort system of Ancud is made up of two forts and four batteries. Fuerte Real de San Carlos was built as late as 1824 by orders of Antonio de Quintanilla, the last Spanish governor of Chiloé. The arsenal (polvorín) of this can still be seen at the centre of a small plaza. The battery of San Antonio is the best preserved part of the fort system.

<text>German modal particles ( or &quot;Abtönungspartikel&quot;) are uninflected words that are used mainly in the spontaneous spoken language in colloquial registers in German. Their dual function is to reflect the mood or the attitude of the speaker or the narrator and to highlight the sentence&#x27;s focus.

Often, a modal particle has an effect that is vague and depends on the overall context. Speakers sometimes combine several particles, as in &quot;doch mal&quot;, &quot;ja nun&quot; or &quot;ja doch nun mal&quot;. It is a feature typical of the spoken language.

Most German words can be translated into English without any problems but modal particles are a challenge to translate because English has no real equivalent to them.

==List of modal particles==
Halt, eben and einmal (in this context always in full) and nun einmal (shortened: nun mal) imply that the often-unpleasant fact expressed in a sentence cannot be changed and must be accepted. &quot;Halt&quot; and &quot;nun mal&quot; are more colloquial than &quot;eben&quot;. In English, they could be rendered by &quot;as a matter of fact&quot; or &quot;happen to&quot;:

:Gute Kleider sind eben teuer. (&quot;Good clothes are expensive, and it can&#x27;t be helped.&quot; / &quot;Good clothes happen to be expensive.&quot;)
:Er hat mich provoziert, da habe ich ihn halt geschlagen. (&quot;He provoked me so I hit him – what did you expect?&quot;)
:Es ist nun einmal so. (&quot;That&#x27;s just how it is.&quot;)

Einmal, shortened to mal (literally &quot;once&quot;, roughly &quot;for once&quot;) primarily indicates that the speaker dispenses with temporal precision, it can indicate a certain immediacy to the action or even imply a command. On the other hand, it can give a kind of casualness to a sentence and so makes it sound less blunt:

:Hör mal zu! (Listen!&quot; or &quot;Listen to me&quot;!)
:Beeile dich mal! (&quot;Do hurry up!&quot;)
:Sing mal etwas Schönes! (&quot;Why don&#x27;t you sing something pretty?&quot;)
:Schauen wir mal. (lit.: &quot;Let&#x27;s take one look.&quot; meaning: &quot;Let&#x27;s just relax and then we&#x27;ll see what we&#x27;ll be doing.&quot;)

Ja (&quot;you know&quot;/&quot;everyone knows&quot;/&quot;I already told you&quot;) indicates that the speaker thinks that the fact should already be known to the listener and intends the statement to be more of a reminder or conclusion:

:Ich habe ihm ein Buch geschenkt, er liest ja sehr gerne. (&quot;I gave him a book as, you know, he likes to read.&quot;)
:Heidi ist ja ein Kind. (&quot;Heidi is a child as you can see.&quot;)

Doch can have several meanings. (See also .) It can be used affirmatively or to convey emphasis, urgency or impatience. It can also be a reply to a real, imagined, or pre-emptively-answered disagreement, hesitation, or wrong assumption on the part of the listener or other people. In other situations, it can have different effects.

Conversely, &quot;doch&quot; can also express doubt and in writing, the affirmative and the doubtful meanings may be ambiguous and depend on context. In speech, the different meanings of &quot;doch&quot; can be told apart by different types of emphasis:

:Gehst Du nicht nach Hause? Doch, ich gehe gleich. (&quot;Are you not going home?&quot; &quot;Oh, yes, I am going in a moment&quot;.) (Affirmation of a negative question; obligatory.)
:Komm doch her! (&quot;Do come here!&quot;) (Emphatically)
:Komm doch endlich her! (&quot;Do come on! Get a move on!&quot;) (More emphatically and impatiently)
:Ich habe dir doch gesagt, dass es nicht so ist. (&quot;I &quot;did&quot; tell you that it isn&#x27;t like that.&quot; or &quot;I told you it isn&#x27;t like that, &quot;didn&#x27;t I?&quot;&quot;)
:Ich kenne mich in Berlin aus. Ich war doch letztes Jahr dort. (&quot;I know my way around Berlin. I was there last year, after all/as a matter of fact.&quot;)

In that way, &quot;doch&quot; can be similar to stressed &quot;schon&quot; (&quot;indeed&quot;), but stressed &quot;schon&quot; implies an actual qualification of the statement, which is often made explicit by a phrase with &quot;aber&quot; (&quot;but&quot;):

:Ich war schon auf der Party, aber Spaß hatte ich nicht. (&quot;I was indeed at the party, but I did not enjoy myself.&quot;)

That should not be confused with the adverbial meaning of the unstressed &quot;schon&quot;, &quot;already&quot;. However, at least in writing, &quot;schon&quot; &quot;already&quot; must be either made unmistakable by the context, such as by additional adverbs, or replaced by its equivalent, &quot;bereits&quot;:

:Ich war &quot;schon&quot; (/bereits) auf der Party, aber Spaß hatte ich (&quot;noch&quot;) nicht. (&quot;I was already at the party, but I hadn&#x27;t had any fun (yet).&quot;)

In other contexts, &quot;doch&quot; indicates that the action described in the sentence is unlikely to occur:

:Du bist also doch gekommen! (&quot;You came after all.&quot;)
:Ich sehe nicht viel fern, aber wenn etwas Gutes kommt, schalte ich doch ein. (&quot;I don&#x27;t watch much TV, but I do tune in if something good comes on.&quot;)

Gar is used to intensify a statement, the completeness or a total lack of something:

:Ich besitze gar kein Auto. (&quot;I&#x27;m afraid I have no car [at all].&quot;)

At the beginning of a sentence, especially in literary contexts, &quot;gar&quot; sometimes has a different meaning and is often interchangeable with &quot;sogar&quot; or &quot;ganz&quot;:

:Gar die Lehrerin hat über dich gelacht! = &quot;Sogar&quot; die Lehrerin hat über dich gelacht! (&quot;Even the teacher laughed at you!&quot;) Here, &quot;gar&quot; does not act as a modal particle.
:Gar 20 Jahre lebe ich jetzt schon hier. = &quot;Ganze&quot; 20 Jahre lebe ich jetzt schon hier. (&quot;I have already been living here for two entire decades.&quot;)

&quot;Rein&quot; often precedes &quot;gar&quot; to point out the total lack of something:

:Ich habe rein gar nichts gemacht! (&quot;I did absolutely nothing!&quot;)

Total, besides its use as an adjective and adverb, can also act as a modal particle indicating irony. It is best translated as &quot;well&quot;, &quot;really&quot; or &quot;let me think...&quot;:

:A: Hast du Lust meinen Geschirrspüler auszuräumen? B: Total... (&quot;A: Do you want to empty my dishwasher? B: Let me think... no!&quot;)
:Ich musste heute drei Stunden beim Arzt warten... hat total Spaß gemacht... (&quot;Today I had to wait for three hours at the doctor&#x27;s office... it really was a lot of fun!&quot;)

Aber, when not as a conjunction, is very similar to &quot;doch&quot; and conveys a meaning of disagreement to a previously stated or implied assertion. Alternatively &quot;aber&quot; can be used to show surprise:

: Du sprichst aber schon gut Deutsch! (&quot;But you do already speak good German!&quot;)
: Du sprichst aber gut Deutsch! (&quot;Wow, do you speak good German!&quot;)

Sowieso, ohnehin or eh, meaning &quot;anyway(s)&quot;, implies an emphasized assertion. Especially in Southern German, &quot;eh&quot; is colloquially most common. All these can be enforced by a preceding &quot;doch&quot;:

:Ich hab ihm eh gesagt, dass er sich wärmer anziehen soll. (&quot;I told him to put on warmer clothes in the first place.&quot;)
:Das ist eh nicht wahr. (&quot;That&#x27;s not true anyway.&quot;)

Vielleicht, as a modal particle, is used for emphasis and should not be confused with the adverb &quot;vielleicht&quot;, meaning &quot;perhaps&quot;:

:Das ist vielleicht ein großer Hund! (with an emphasis on &quot;Das&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s quite a large dog!&quot;)
But:
:Vielleicht ist das ein großer Hund. Es ist schwer zu erkennen. (&quot;Maybe that&#x27;s a large dog. It&#x27;s difficult to tell.&quot;)

Fei, which is no longer recognised as the adverb &quot;fein&quot; &quot;finely&quot;, is a particle peculiar to Upper German dialects. It denotes that the speaker states that something important might be a surprise for the listener. Giving an adequate translation even into Standard German is difficult, and the best substitute would probably be to use an understatement with strong affirmative meaning. In English, translations to &quot;I should think&quot; or &quot;just to mention&quot; seem possible depending on context:

:&quot;Des kôsch fei net macha!&quot; (Swabian) = Das kannst du (eigentlich wirklich) nicht machen. (You can&#x27;t do that! / If you do look at it, you really can&#x27;t do that. / You can&#x27;t, I should think, do that.)
:&quot;I bin fei ned aus Preissen!&quot; (Bavarian) = Ich bin, das wollte ich nur einmal anmerken, nicht aus Preußen. / Ich bin wohlgemerkt (gar) nicht aus Preußen. (Just to mention, I&#x27;m not from Prussia.)

Wohl is often used instead of epistemic adverbs, such as &quot;vermutlich&quot; or &quot;wahrscheinlich&quot; or to emphasise a strong disagreement. A literal translation with &quot;probably&quot; or at least with &quot;seemingly&quot; is possible:
:Es wird wohl Regen geben. (&quot;It looks like rain. / It&#x27;s probably going to rain.&quot;)
:Du bist wohl verrückt! (&quot;You must be out of your mind!&quot;)

<text>Software prototyping is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications, i.e., incomplete versions of the software program being developed. It is an activity that can occur in software development and is comparable to prototyping as known from other fields, such as mechanical engineering or manufacturing.

A prototype typically simulates only a few aspects of, and may be completely different from, the final product. 

Prototyping has several benefits: the software designer and implementer can get valuable feedback from the users early in the project. The client and the contractor can compare if the software made matches the software specification, according to which the software program is built. It also allows the software engineer some insight into the accuracy of initial project estimates and whether the deadlines and milestones proposed can be successfully met. The degree of completeness and the techniques used in prototyping have been in development and debate since its proposal in the early 1970s.

==Overview==
The purpose of a prototype is to allow users of the software to evaluate developers&#x27; proposals for the design of the eventual product by actually trying them out, rather than having to interpret and evaluate the design based on descriptions. Software prototyping provides an understanding of the software&#x27;s functions and potential threats or issues. Prototyping can also be used by end users to describe and prove requirements that have not been considered, and that can be a key factor in the commercial relationship between developers and their clients. Interaction design in particular makes heavy use of prototyping with that goal.

This process is in contrast with the 1960s and 1970s monolithic development cycle of building the entire program first and then working out any inconsistencies between design and implementation, which led to higher software costs and poor estimates of time and cost. The monolithic approach has been dubbed the &quot;Slaying the (software) Dragon&quot; technique, since it assumes that the software designer and developer is a single hero who has to slay the entire dragon alone. Prototyping can also avoid the great expense and difficulty of having to change a finished software product.

The practice of prototyping is one of the points Frederick P. Brooks makes in his 1975 book &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; and his 10-year anniversary article &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot;.

An early example of large-scale software prototyping was the implementation of NYU&#x27;s Ada/ED translator for the Ada programming language. It was implemented in SETL with the intent of producing an executable semantic model for the Ada language, emphasizing clarity of design and user interface over speed and efficiency. The NYU Ada/ED system was the first validated Ada implementation, certified on April 11, 1983.

==Outline==
The process of prototyping involves the following steps:

# Identify basic requirements
#:Determine basic requirements including the input and output information desired. Details, such as security, can typically be ignored.
# Develop initial prototype
#:The initial prototype is developed that includes only user interfaces. (See Horizontal Prototype, below)
# Review
#:The customers, including end-users, examine the prototype and provide feedback on potential additions or changes.
# Revise and enhance the prototype
#: Using the feedback both the specifications and the prototype can be improved. Negotiation about what is within the scope of the contract/product may be necessary. If changes are introduced then a repeat of steps #3 and #4 may be needed.

== Dimensions ==

Nielsen summarizes the various dimensions of prototypes in his book &quot;Usability Engineering&quot;:

=== Horizontal prototype ===

A common term for a user interface prototype is the horizontal prototype. It provides a broad view of an entire system or subsystem, focusing on user interaction more than low-level system functionality, such as database access. Horizontal prototypes are useful for:
* Confirmation of user interface requirements and system scope,
* Demonstration version of the system to obtain buy-in from the business,
* Develop preliminary estimates of development time, cost and effort.

===Vertical prototype===

A vertical prototype is an enhanced complete elaboration of a single subsystem or function. It is useful for obtaining detailed requirements for a given function, with the following benefits:
* Refinement database design,
* Obtain information on data volumes and system interface needs, for network sizing and performance engineering,
* Clarify complex requirements by drilling down to actual system functionality.

==Types==
Software prototyping has many variants. However, all of the methods are in some way based on two major forms of prototyping: throwaway prototyping and evolutionary prototyping.

===Throwaway prototyping===
Also called close-ended prototyping. Throwaway or rapid prototyping refers to the creation of a model that will eventually be discarded rather than becoming part of the final delivered software. After preliminary requirements gathering is accomplished, a simple working model of the system is constructed to visually show the users what their requirements may look like when they are implemented into a finished system.
It is also a form of rapid prototyping. 
:Rapid prototyping involves creating a working model of various parts of the system at a very early stage, after a relatively short investigation. The method used in building it is usually quite informal, the most important factor being the speed with which the model is provided. The model then becomes the starting point from which users can re-examine their expectations and clarify their requirements. When this goal has been achieved, the prototype model is &#x27;thrown away&#x27;, and the system is formally developed based on the identified requirements.

The most obvious reason for using throwaway prototyping is that it can be done quickly. If the users can get quick feedback on their requirements, they may be able to refine them early in the development of the software. Making changes early in the development lifecycle is extremely cost effective since there is nothing at that point to redo. If a project is changed after a considerable amount of work has been done then small changes could require large efforts to implement since software systems have many dependencies. Speed is crucial in implementing a throwaway prototype, since with a limited budget of time and money little can be expended on a prototype that will be discarded.

Another strength of throwaway prototyping is its ability to construct interfaces that the users can test. The user interface is what the user sees as the system, and by seeing it in front of them, it is much easier to grasp how the system will function.

:…it is asserted that revolutionary rapid prototyping is a more effective manner in which to deal with user requirements-related issues, and therefore a greater enhancement to software productivity overall. Requirements can be identified, simulated, and tested far more quickly and cheaply when issues of evolvability, maintainability, and software structure are ignored. This, in turn, leads to the accurate specification of requirements, and the subsequent construction of a valid and usable system from the user&#x27;s perspective, via conventional software development models.

Prototypes can be classified according to the fidelity with which they resemble the actual product in terms of appearance, interaction and timing. One method of creating a low fidelity throwaway prototype is paper prototyping. The prototype is implemented using paper and pencil, and thus mimics the function of the actual product, but does not look at all like it. Another method to easily build high fidelity throwaway prototypes is to use a GUI Builder and create a &quot;click dummy&quot;, a prototype that looks like the goal system, but does not provide any functionality.

The usage of storyboards, animatics or drawings is not exactly the same as throwaway prototyping, but certainly falls within the same family. These are non-functional implementations but show how the system will look.

Summary: In this approach the prototype is constructed with the idea that it will be discarded and the final system will be built from scratch. The steps in this approach are:
#Write preliminary requirements
#Design the prototype
#User experiences/uses the prototype, specifies new requirements
#Repeat if necessary
#Write the final requirements

===Evolutionary prototyping===

Evolutionary prototyping (also known as breadboard prototyping) is quite different from throwaway prototyping. The main goal when using evolutionary prototyping is to build a very robust prototype in a structured manner and constantly refine it. The reason for this approach is that the evolutionary prototype, when built, forms the heart of the new system, and the improvements and further requirements will then be built.

When developing a system using evolutionary prototyping, the system is continually refined and rebuilt. 
:&quot;…evolutionary prototyping acknowledges that we do not understand all the requirements and builds only those that are well understood.&quot;
This technique allows the development team to add features, or make changes that couldn&#x27;t be conceived during the requirements and design phase.

:For a system to be useful, it must evolve through use in its intended operational environment. A product is never &quot;done;&quot; it is always maturing as the usage environment changes…we often try to define a system using our most familiar frame of reference—where we are now. We make assumptions about the way business will be conducted and the technology base on which the business will be implemented. A plan is enacted to develop the capability, and, sooner or later, something resembling the envisioned system is delivered.

Evolutionary prototypes have an advantage over throwaway prototypes in that they are functional systems. Although they may not have all the features the users have planned, they may be used on an interim basis until the final system is delivered.

:&quot;It is not unusual within a prototyping environment for the user to put an initial prototype to practical use while waiting for a more developed version…The user may decide that a &#x27;flawed&#x27; system is better than no system at all.&quot;

In evolutionary prototyping, developers can focus themselves to develop parts of the system that they understand instead of working on developing a whole system.

:To minimize risk, the developer does not implement poorly understood features. The partial system is sent to customer sites. As users work with the system, they detect opportunities for new features and give requests for these features to developers. Developers then take these enhancement requests along with their own and use sound configuration-management practices to change the software-requirements specification, update the design, recode and retest.

===Incremental prototyping===
The final product is built as separate prototypes. At the end, the separate prototypes are merged in an overall design. By the help of incremental prototyping the time gap between user and software developer is reduced.

===Extreme prototyping===
Extreme prototyping as a development process is used especially for developing web applications. Basically, it breaks down web development into three phases, each one based on the preceding one. The first phase is a static prototype that consists mainly of HTML pages. In the second phase, the screens are programmed and fully functional using a simulated services layer. In the third phase, the services are implemented. 
:&quot;The process is called Extreme Prototyping to draw attention to the second phase of the process, where a fully functional UI is developed with very little regard to the services other than their contract.&quot;

==Advantages==
There are many advantages to using prototyping in software development – some tangible, some abstract.

Reduced time and costs: Prototyping can improve the quality of requirements and specifications provided to developers. Because changes cost exponentially more to implement as they are detected later in development, the early determination of &quot;what the user really wants&quot; can result in faster and less expensive software.

Improved and increased user involvement: Prototyping requires user involvement and allows them to see and interact with a prototype allowing them to provide better and more complete feedback and specifications. The presence of the prototype being examined by the user prevents many misunderstandings and miscommunications that occur when each side believe the other understands what they said. Since users know the problem domain better than anyone on the development team does, increased interaction can result in a final product that has greater tangible and intangible quality. The final product is more likely to satisfy the user&#x27;s desire for look, feel and performance.

==Disadvantages==

Using, or perhaps misusing, prototyping can also have disadvantages.

Insufficient analysis: The focus on a limited prototype can distract developers from properly analyzing the complete project. This can lead to overlooking better solutions, preparation of incomplete specifications or the conversion of limited prototypes into poorly engineered final projects that are hard to maintain. Further, since a prototype is limited in functionality it may not scale well if the prototype is used as the basis of a final deliverable, which may not be noticed if developers are too focused on building a prototype as a model.

User confusion of prototype and finished system: Users can begin to think that a prototype, intended to be thrown away, is actually a final system that merely needs to be finished or polished. (They are, for example, often unaware of the effort needed to add error-checking and security features which a prototype may not have.) This can lead them to expect the prototype to accurately model the performance of the final system when this is not the intent of the developers. Users can also become attached to features that were included in a prototype for consideration and then removed from the specification for a final system. If users are able to require all proposed features be included in the final system this can lead to conflict.

Developer misunderstanding of user objectives: Developers may assume that users share their objectives (e.g. to deliver core functionality on time and within budget), without understanding wider commercial issues. For example, user representatives attending Enterprise software (e.g. PeopleSoft) events may have seen demonstrations of &quot;transaction auditing&quot; (where changes are logged and displayed in a difference grid view) without being told that this feature demands additional coding and often requires more hardware to handle extra database accesses. Users might believe they can demand auditing on every field, whereas developers might think this is feature creep because they have made assumptions about the extent of user requirements. If the developer has committed delivery before the user requirements were reviewed, developers are between a rock and a hard place, particularly if user management derives some advantage from their failure to implement requirements.

Developer attachment to prototype: Developers can also become attached to prototypes they have spent a great deal of effort producing; this can lead to problems, such as attempting to convert a limited prototype into a final system when it does not have an appropriate underlying architecture. (This may suggest that throwaway prototyping, rather than evolutionary prototyping, should be used.)

Excessive development time of the prototype: A key property to prototyping is the fact that it is supposed to be done quickly. If the developers lose sight of this fact, they very well may try to develop a prototype that is too complex. When the prototype is thrown away the precisely developed requirements that it provides may not yield a sufficient increase in productivity to make up for the time spent developing the prototype. Users can become stuck in debates over details of the prototype, holding up the development team and delaying the final product.

Expense of implementing prototyping: the start up costs for building a development team focused on prototyping may be high. Many companies have development methodologies in place, and changing them can mean retraining, retooling, or both. Many companies tend to just begin prototyping without bothering to retrain their workers as much as they should.

:A common problem with adopting prototyping technology is high expectations for productivity with insufficient effort behind the learning curve. In addition to training for the use of a prototyping technique, there is an often overlooked need for developing corporate and project specific underlying structure to support the technology. When this underlying structure is omitted, lower productivity can often result.

==Applicability==
It has been argued that prototyping, in some form or another, should be used all the time. However, prototyping is most beneficial in systems that will have many interactions with the users.

:It has been found that prototyping is very effective in the analysis and design of on-line systems, especially for transaction processing, where the use of screen dialogs is much more in evidence. The greater the interaction between the computer and the user, the greater the benefit is that can be obtained from building a quick system and letting the user play with it.

Systems with little user interaction, such as batch processing or systems that mostly do calculations, benefit little from prototyping. Sometimes, the coding needed to perform the system functions may be too intensive and the potential gains that prototyping could provide are too small.

Prototyping is especially good for designing good human–computer interfaces. &quot;One of the most productive uses of rapid prototyping to date has been as a tool for iterative user requirements engineering and human–computer interface design.&quot;

===Dynamic systems development method===
Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is a framework for delivering business solutions that relies heavily upon prototyping as a core technique, and is itself ISO 9001 approved. It expands upon most understood definitions of a prototype. According to DSDM the prototype may be a diagram, a business process, or even a system placed into production. DSDM prototypes are intended to be incremental, evolving from simple forms into more comprehensive ones.

DSDM prototypes can sometimes be &quot;throwaway&quot; or &quot;evolutionary&quot;. Evolutionary prototypes may be evolved horizontally (breadth then depth) or vertically (each section is built in detail with additional iterations detailing subsequent sections). Evolutionary prototypes can eventually evolve into final systems.

The four categories of prototypes as recommended by DSDM are:
* Business prototypes – used to design and demonstrates the business processes being automated.
* Usability prototypes – used to define, refine, and demonstrate user interface design usability, accessibility, look and feel.
* Performance and capacity prototypes – used to define, demonstrate, and predict how systems will perform under peak loads as well as to demonstrate and evaluate other non-functional aspects of the system (transaction rates, data storage volume, response time, etc.)
* Capability/technique prototypes – used to develop, demonstrate, and evaluate a design approach or concept.

The DSDM lifecycle of a prototype is to:
# Identify prototype
# Agree to a plan
# Create the prototype
# Review the prototype

===Operational prototyping===
Operational prototyping was proposed by Alan Davis as a way to integrate throwaway and evolutionary prototyping with conventional system development. &quot;It offers the best of both the quick-and-dirty and conventional-development worlds in a sensible manner. Designers develop only well-understood features in building the evolutionary baseline, while using throwaway prototyping to experiment with the poorly understood features.&quot;

Davis&#x27; belief is that to try to &quot;retrofit quality onto a rapid prototype&quot; is not the correct method when trying to combine the two approaches. His idea is to engage in an evolutionary prototyping methodology and rapidly prototype the features of the system after each evolution.

The specific methodology follows these steps:

*An evolutionary prototype is constructed and made into a baseline using conventional development strategies, specifying and implementing only the requirements that are well understood.
*Copies of the baseline are sent to multiple customer sites along with a trained prototyper.
*At each site, the prototyper watches the user at the system.
*Whenever the user encounters a problem or thinks of a new feature or requirement, the prototyper logs it. This frees the user from having to record the problem, and allows him to continue working.
*After the user session is over, the prototyper constructs a throwaway prototype on top of the baseline system.
*The user now uses the new system and evaluates. If the new changes aren&#x27;t effective, the prototyper removes them.
*If the user likes the changes, the prototyper writes feature-enhancement requests and forwards them to the development team.
*The development team, with the change requests in hand from all the sites, then produce a new evolutionary prototype using conventional methods.

Obviously, a key to this method is to have well trained prototypers available to go to the user sites. The operational prototyping methodology has many benefits in systems that are complex and have few known requirements in advance.

===Evolutionary systems development===
Evolutionary Systems Development is a class of methodologies that attempt to formally implement evolutionary prototyping. One particular type, called Systemscraft is described by John Crinnion in his book &quot;Evolutionary Systems Development&quot;.

Systemscraft was designed as a &#x27;prototype&#x27; methodology that should be modified and adapted to fit the specific environment in which it was implemented.

:Systemscraft was not designed as a rigid &#x27;cookbook&#x27; approach to the development process. It is now generally recognised[sic] that a good methodology should be flexible enough to be adjustable to suit all kinds of environment and situation...

The basis of Systemscraft, not unlike evolutionary prototyping, is to create a working system from the initial requirements and build upon it in a series of revisions. Systemscraft places heavy emphasis on traditional analysis being used throughout the development of the system.

===Evolutionary rapid development===
Evolutionary Rapid Development (ERD) was developed by the Software Productivity Consortium, a technology development and integration agent for the Information Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

:Fundamental to ERD is the concept of composing software systems based on the reuse of components, the use of software templates and on an architectural template. Continuous evolution of system capabilities in rapid response to changing user needs and technology is highlighted by the evolvable architecture, representing a class of solutions. The process focuses on the use of small artisan-based teams integrating software and systems engineering disciplines working multiple, often parallel short-duration timeboxes with frequent customer interaction.

:Key to the success of the ERD-based projects is parallel exploratory analysis and development of features, infrastructures, and components with and adoption of leading edge technologies enabling the quick reaction to changes in technologies, the marketplace, or customer requirements.

To elicit customer/user input, frequent scheduled and ad hoc/impromptu meetings with the stakeholders are held. Demonstrations of system capabilities are held to solicit feedback before design/implementation decisions are solidified. Frequent releases (e.g., betas) are made available for use to provide insight into how the system could better support user and customer needs. This assures that the system evolves to satisfy existing user needs.

The design framework for the system is based on using existing published or de facto standards. The system is organized to allow for evolving a set of capabilities that includes considerations for performance, capacities, and functionality. The architecture is defined in terms of abstract interfaces that encapsulate the services and their implementation (e.g., COTS applications). The architecture serves as a template to be used for guiding development of more than a single instance of the system. It allows for multiple application components to be used to implement the services. A core set of functionality not likely to change is also identified and established.

The ERD process is structured to use demonstrated functionality rather than paper products as a way for stakeholders to communicate their needs and expectations. Central to this goal of rapid delivery is the use of the &quot;timebox&quot; method. Timeboxes are fixed periods of time in which specific tasks (e.g., developing a set of functionality) must be performed. Rather than allowing time to expand to satisfy some vague set of goals, the time is fixed (both in terms of calendar weeks and person-hours) and a set of goals is defined that realistically can be achieved within these constraints. To keep development from degenerating into a &quot;random walk,&quot; long-range plans are defined to guide the iterations. These plans provide a vision for the overall system and set boundaries (e.g., constraints) for the project. Each iteration within the process is conducted in the context of these long-range plans.

Once an architecture is established, software is integrated and tested on a daily basis. This allows the team to assess progress objectively and identify potential problems quickly. Since small amounts of the system are integrated at one time, diagnosing and removing the defect is rapid. User demonstrations can be held at short notice since the system is generally ready to exercise at all times.

==Tools==
Efficiently using prototyping requires that an organization have the proper tools and a staff trained to use those tools. Tools used in prototyping can vary from individual tools, such as 4th generation programming languages used for rapid prototyping to complex integrated CASE tools. 4th generation visual programming languages like Visual Basic and ColdFusion are frequently used since they are cheap, well known and relatively easy and fast to use. CASE tools, supporting requirements analysis, like the Requirements Engineering Environment (see below) are often developed or selected by the military or large organizations. Object oriented tools are also being developed like LYMB from the GE Research and Development Center. Users may prototype elements of an application themselves in a spreadsheet.

As web-based applications continue to grow in popularity, so too, have the tools for prototyping such applications. Frameworks such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and AngularJS provide the tools necessary to quickly structure a proof of concept. These frameworks typically consist of a set of controls, interactions, and design guidelines that enable developers to quickly prototype web applications.

===Screen generators, design tools, and software factories===
Screen generating programs are also commonly used and they enable prototypers to show user&#x27;s systems that do not function, but show what the screens may look like. Developing Human Computer Interfaces can sometimes be the critical part of the development effort, since to the users the interface essentially is the system.

Software factories can generate code by combining ready-to-use modular components. This makes them ideal for prototyping applications, since this approach can quickly deliver programs with the desired behaviour, with a minimal amount of manual coding.
===Application definition or simulation software===

A new class of software called Application definition or simulation software enables users to rapidly build lightweight, animated simulations of another computer program, without writing code. Application simulation software allows both technical and non-technical users to experience, test, collaborate and validate the simulated program, and provides reports such as annotations, screenshot and schematics. As a solution specification technique, Application Simulation falls between low-risk, but limited, text or drawing-based mock-ups (or wireframes) sometimes called &quot;paper-based prototyping&quot;, and time-consuming, high-risk code-based prototypes, allowing software professionals to validate requirements and design choices early on, before development begins. In doing so, the risks and costs associated with software implementations can be dramatically reduced.

To simulate applications one can also use software that simulates real-world software programs for computer-based training, demonstration, and customer support, such as screencasting software as those areas are closely related.

===Requirements Engineering Environment===
&quot;The Requirements Engineering Environment (REE), under development at Rome Laboratory since 1985, provides an integrated toolset for rapidly representing, building, and executing models of critical aspects of complex systems.&quot;

Requirements Engineering Environment is currently used by the United States Air Force to develop systems. It is:

:an integrated set of tools that allows systems analysts to rapidly build functional, user interface, and performance prototype models of system components. These modeling activities are performed to gain a greater understanding of complex systems and lessen the impact that inaccurate requirement specifications have on cost and scheduling during the system development process. Models can be constructed easily, and at varying levels of abstraction or granularity, depending on the specific behavioral aspects of the model being exercised.

REE is composed of three parts. The first, called proto is a CASE tool specifically designed to support rapid prototyping. The second part is called the Rapid Interface Prototyping System or RIP, which is a collection of tools that facilitate the creation of user interfaces. The third part of REE is a user interface to RIP and proto that is graphical and intended to be easy to use.

Rome Laboratory, the developer of REE, intended that to support their internal requirements gathering methodology. Their method has three main parts: 
* Elicitation from various sources (users, interfaces to other systems), specification, and consistency checking
* Analysis that the needs of diverse users taken together do not conflict and are technically and economically feasible
* Validation that requirements so derived are an accurate reflection of user needs.

In 1996, Rome Labs contracted Software Productivity Solutions (SPS) to further enhance REE to create &quot;a commercial quality REE that supports requirements specification, simulation, user interface prototyping, mapping of requirements to hardware architectures, and code generation...&quot; This system is named the Advanced Requirements Engineering Workstation or AREW.

===Non-relational environments===
Non-relational definition of data (e.g. using Caché or associative models) can help make end-user prototyping more productive by delaying or avoiding the need to normalize data at every iteration of a simulation. This may yield earlier/greater clarity of business requirements, though it does not specifically confirm that requirements are technically and economically feasible in the target production system.

===PSDL===
PSDL is a prototype description language to describe real-time software.
The associated tool set is CAPS (Computer Aided Prototyping System).
Prototyping software systems with hard real-time requirements is challenging because timing constraints introduce implementation and hardware dependencies.
PSDL addresses these issues by introducing control abstractions that include declarative timing constraints. CAPS uses this information to automatically generate code and associated real-time schedules, monitor timing constraints during prototype execution, and simulate execution in proportional real time relative to a set of parameterized hardware models. It also provides default assumptions that enable execution of incomplete prototype descriptions, integrates prototype construction with a software reuse repository for rapidly realizing efficient implementations, and provides support for rapid evolution of requirements and designs.

<text>The Mitchell River is a river in Far North Queensland, Australia. The river rises on the Atherton Tableland about northwest of Cairns and flows about northwest across Cape York Peninsula from Mareeba to the Gulf of Carpentaria.

The river&#x27;s watershed covers an area of . The Mitchell has the state&#x27;s largest discharge, at annually, but is intermittent and may be dry for part of the year. Lake Mitchell is the main water storage facility on the river.

It was named by Ludwig Leichhardt on 16 June 1845 after Sir Thomas Mitchell while he was on his overland expedition from Moreton Bay to Port Essington. It may have been previously named the Vereenighde River in 1623 by Dutch merchant and navigator Jan Carstensz.

==Biophysical aspects==

The Mitchell River and its tributaries have for a long time carved their way westwards through the rugged, weathered highlands of the Great Dividing Range, carrying away sediments to be deposited in the broad floodplains and wetlands of the Gulf Savannah country.

The rivers&#x27; waters &quot;pulse&quot; annually with monsoonal rains, seasonally collecting water from across the local tropical rainforests in the highlands to the east; the wet sclerophyll forests in the central uplands; a variety of woodlands plus savannah in the western plains; annually flooding with freshwater, the tidal plains, wetlands, estuaries, and mangroves of the lower Mitchell and coastal plains.

From source to mouth, the Mitchell River is joined by 34 tributaries including the McLeod River, Hodgkinson River, St George River, Dry River, Little Mitchell River, Walsh River, Lynd River, Palmer River and Alice River.

Protected areas within the Mitchell River catchment include the Hann Tableland, Mitchell-Alice Rivers, Chillagoe-Mungana Caves, part of Bulleringa to the south, and most of the Forty Mile Scrub national parks.

==Fauna and flora==

Being a large river system, the Mitchell River may contain within its catchment one of Australia&#x27;s most ecologically diverse aquatic systems consisting of a rich variety of both wet and dry tropical monsoonal habitats.

The catchment ecology as a whole has been generally described as follows:
The vegetation in the Mitchell River Catchment area ranges from the World Heritage Wet Tropic rainforest on the eastern highlands to the open savannah on the western and lower Mitchell plains. The extensive mangroves and lagoon systems at the delta of the Mitchell River are recognised worldwide. The permanent waters in the upper catchment are associated with springs and water holes...
More specifically, while this ecologically diverse river system is relatively poorly studied, it is known to contain at least 18 rare, endangered or vulnerable animal species including the golden-shouldered parrot, the Gouldian finch and the northern bettong. The mouth of the river lies in the Gulf Plains Important Bird Area.

==Towns==
The major towns in the river&#x27;s catchment are Kowanyama, Chillagoe, Dimbulah, Mount Carbine and Mount Molloy. Other smaller towns in the Mitchell River catchment include Mutchilba and Almaden.

== History ==
Kunjen (also known as Koko Wanggara, Ngundjan and Olkola) is a language of Western Cape York. The Kunjen language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of Kowanyama Community Council and Cook Shire Council.

Yir Yiront (also known as Yiront, Jirjoront, Yir-yiront, and Kokomindjan) is an Australian Aboriginal language. Its traditional language region is in Western Cape York within the local government areas of Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama and Shire of Cook, in the catchments of the Coleman River and Mitchell River. Following the removal of Aboriginal people from their traditional lands, it is also spoken in Pormpuraaw and Kowanyama.

<text>The Stourbridge Lion was an early railroad steam locomotive. In 1829 it was the first locomotive to be operated in the United States, although foreign-built, and one of the first locomotives to operate outside Britain. It takes its name from the lion&#x27;s face painted on the front, and Stourbridge in England, where it was manufactured by the firm Foster, Rastrick and Company in 1829. The locomotive, obtained by the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company (D&amp;H), was shipped to New York in May 1829, where it was tested raised on blocks. It was then taken to Honesdale, Pennsylvania for testing on the company&#x27;s newly built track. The locomotive performed well in its first test in August 1829, but was found to be too heavy for the track and was never used for its intended purpose of hauling coal wagons. During the next few decades, a number of parts were removed from the abandoned locomotive until only the boiler and a few other components remained. These were acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1890 and are currently on display at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore.

==History==

One of the first railroads in the United States, the D&amp;H was originally chartered in 1823 to build and operate canals between New York City and the coal fields around Carbondale, Pennsylvania. While the line was originally planned as a canal for the entire route, company engineers began thinking about rail transportation as early as 1825; the initial plan was to build a railroad between the mines and the western end of the canal as a way to get the coal to the canal boats.

John B. Jervis, who later became the designer of the (the &quot;Jervis&quot; type) locomotive, was named the D&amp;H&#x27;s chief engineer in 1827. Jervis planned out a series of inclines connected by level, but themselves disconnected, railroads. The company directors liked Jervis&#x27;s plan and authorized its construction with some hesitation for the as-yet unproven railroad technology.

In 1828, a former coworker of Jervis, Horatio Allen, went on a railroad research tour of England. Through Allen, Jervis sent specifications for locomotives that could be used on the D&amp;H. Allen wrote back in July that four locomotives had been ordered, three from Foster, Rastrick and Company and one from Robert Stephenson and Company, for the D&amp;H.

&quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; was one of these three locomotives built by Rastrick, but Stephenson&#x27;s shop had completed their locomotive, the &quot;Pride of Newcastle&quot;, before any of Rastrick&#x27;s locomotives. The &quot;Pride of Newcastle&quot; even arrived in America nearly two months before the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot;, but it was the latter that was used for the first railroad trials. The price on delivery of the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; was $2,914.90, .

The locomotive was transported from Liverpool aboard the ship &quot;John Jay&quot;, arriving at New York in mid-May 1829. It was assembled at the West Point Foundry in New York where it was first tested under steam. Here, it was reported that it &quot;became the object of curiosity to thousands who visited the works from day to day to see the &#x27;critter&#x27; go through the motions only&quot;. Its first official run took place on August 8, 1829 in Honesdale, Pennsylvania. According to an eye-witness, &quot;the fire was kindled and steam raised, and, under the management of Horatio Allen, the &#x27;wonderful machine&#x27; was found capable of moving, to the great joy of the crowd of excited spectators&quot;. Despite having no experience of driving a locomotive, Allen took the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; out for its first test on his own, driving it about three miles along the track including a raised section over the Lackawaxen Creek. He then reversed the locomotive back to its starting point. The locomotive performed admirably, but the track that was built on which to run it was insufficient for the task (the company had not used all-iron rails but instead iron strips applied to a wooden rail). Jervis had specified that the locomotives should weigh no more than 4 tons; the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; weighed nearly double that, 7.5 tons.

The two other Foster, Rastrick &amp; Co locomotives that had been ordered by Allen, &quot;Delaware&quot; and &quot;Hudson&quot;, arrived separately at New York in August and September 1829 before being shipped on to Rondout.
Rastrick built another engine at about the same time as the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; intended for use in England. This engine, the &quot;Agenoria&quot;, was of very similar to the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; although of a different gauge and with a markedly longer chimney. The &quot;Agenoria&quot; first ran in June 1829, was operated for more than 30 years and is currently preserved at the National Railway Museum in York, England.

By 1834, documents show that the railroad attempted to sell the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; and its early sisters to the Pennsylvania Canal Commission, but the deal was not finalized. The locomotives were deemed too unsuitable for the now expanding railroads; American locomotive manufacturers had begun producing their own locomotives of improved designs as early as 1830. The four locomotives were used as sources of English wrought-iron bar stock until the middle of the 1840s.

By 1845, all that was left of the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; was its boiler. The boiler was still functional, however, and it was used in a foundry in Carbondale for about another five years until the foundry&#x27;s owner headed west to try his luck as a Forty-niner. The foundry was sold a few years later to new owners who recognized the boiler&#x27;s value as a piece of history, and in 1874 reportedly tried to sell it for $1,000 (). The owners were unable to find a buyer.

In 1883, the D&amp;H borrowed the boiler to display at the Exposition of Railway Appliances in Chicago. Unfortunately, security around the boiler&#x27;s transportation was lax; souvenir hunters pulled every loose item that they could off the now historic boiler, even resorting to hammers and chisels to remove portions of it.
The boiler was stored again and eventually acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1890. A few other parts that are believed to have been from the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; are also preserved, but their authenticity is questioned. These other parts may have come from one or more of the locomotive&#x27;s sister engines. The museum has made a few attempts to rebuild the locomotive with the parts that remain. However, with the parts&#x27; origins still in question, and the lack of a few other key parts, the locomotive&#x27;s reconstruction has never been completed. The boiler and assembled parts are currently on display at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore.
The D&amp;H built their own replica of the &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot; in 1932 from plans that were made based on the parts remaining in existence. The Wayne County Historical Society Museum contains a full-scale replica of the Stourbridge Lion, and is home to many related photographs and artifacts. This museum is in a small brick building on Main Street, Honesdale, Pennsylvania, which was once the D&amp;H Canal&#x27;s company office, and is where the Stourbridge Lion began its inaugural run.

==Mechanical description==
The boiler had a simple single flue, with the chimney exiting through the upper part of the boiler drum. This was not a smokebox as such, as there was no smokebox door for access and cleaning. A prominent external exhaust pipe ahead of the boiler led to a blastpipe within the chimney. The exhaust pipe is visible in many pictures of the locomotive.

The piston rods connected to a pair of grasshopper beams (one for each cylinder) mounted above the boiler. A connecting rod near the piston end of the walking beams drove the rear axle&#x27;s wheels, where it also connected to a coupling rod to drive the front wheels.

<doc id="1090861" wikidata="Q1529373" url="?curid=1090861" title="Glass brick">
<text>Glass brick, also known as glass block, is an architectural element made from glass. The appearance of glass blocks can vary in color, size, texture and form. Glass bricks provide visual obscuration while admitting light. The modern glass block was developed from pre-existing prism lighting principles in the early 1900s to provide natural light in manufacturing plants. Today glass blocks are used in walls, skylights, and sidewalk lights.

== Attributes ==
=== Appearance ===
The texture and color of glass blocks can vary in order to provide a range of transparency. Patterns can be pressed into either the inner void or the outside surface of the glass when it is cooling in order to provide differing effects. Glazes or inserts may also be added in order to create a desired private or decorative effect.

=== Standards and grading ===
Glass blocks in Europe are manufactured in accordance with the European Standard EN1052-2. The International Standard is ISO TC 160/SG1. The Standards allow for variation in sizes and production irregularity. Blocks fall within three classifications; Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3 with Class 1 being the highest and best rating with a maximum permissible deviation from designed size and rectangularity of 1 mm.

===Insulation===
Glass brick has an r value between 1.75 and 1.96, close to that of thermopane windows. There are newer glass blocks injected with argon gas and having a layer of low-emissivity glass between the halves, which increases the insulative (U) value to 1.5 W/m2·K, which is between triple glazed windows (1.8 W/m2·K) and specialty double glazed windows with advanced frame and coatings(1.2 W/m2·K).

== Applications ==
=== Wall blocks ===
Glass blocks can provide light and serve as a decorative addition to an architectural structure, but hollow glass blocks are non load-bearing unless stated otherwise. Hollow glass wall blocks are manufactured as two separate halves and, while the glass is still molten, the two pieces are pressed together and annealed. The resulting glass blocks will have a partial vacuum at the hollow center. Due to the hollow center, wall glass blocks do not have the load-bearing capacity of masonry bricks and therefore are utilized in curtain walls. Glass block walls are constrained based on the framing in which they are set. If a masonry or steel frame exists, the maximum area of the wall can be , whereas the maximum area without a frame is .

The William Lescaze House and Office at 211 East 48th Street in New York City, built in 1934, was the city&#x27;s first house to use glass blocks as walls.

=== Skylights and sidewalk lights ===
Glass blocks used in flooring are normally manufactured as a single solid piece, or as a hollow glass block with thicker side walls than the standard wall blocks. These blocks are normally cast into a reinforced concrete gridwork or set into a metal frame, allowing multiple units to be combined to span over openings in basements and roofs to create skylights. Glass wall blocks should not be used in flooring applications because the way in which they are manufactured does not allow them to support a load.

===Construction methods===
Glass wall blocks are fixed together to form complete walls by several methods – the most common method of construction is to bed the blocks together in a Portland cement-based mortar with reinforcing rods of steel placed within the mortar as recommended by the project architect or block manufacturer.

Other methods of construction include several proprietary systems whereby the mortar is replaced by timber or PVC extrusions.

==Specialty types==
Specialist glass blocks are produced for various applications including:

===Bullet and vandal resistance===
Bullet and vandal resistant blocks are generally solid glass or have very thick side walls similar to pavement blocks.

===Fire resistant===
Fire resistance of varying degrees can be achieved by several methods. Standard production hollow wall block will offer little fire resistance; however, resistance is improved by utilizing specially produced hollow blocks with thicker sidewalls, or the inclusion of a special layer of fire-resisting material between the two halves of the block during manufacture. Some manufacturers of glass blocks have developed a method of bonding two glass blocks together with adhesive, producing blocks of up to 160 mm (6½&quot;) thick with enhanced fire resistance. It is important that the block manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations are followed with regards to the installation of fire resisting glass block walls, as without special construction techniques, the wall will not achieve the desired fire resistance.

===Gas insulated===
A recent innovation in the manufacture of glass blocks is the inclusion of argon gas within the hollow center of glass wall blocks. This advancement in production technique has resulted in a glass block which is able to offer significantly improved thermal insulation properties.

===Colored===
Some hollow glass wall blocks are available in colored variants. These colored variants fall into two categories. The first type is manufactured with UV stable colored glass and can be used in the same locations as standard clear glass blocks. The second type utilizes a colored material (dye or transparent paint) which is injected into the hollow center of the blocks to form a permanent coating, enabling vibrant colors to be achieved which are not possible with colored glass. However, the colored coating may not be UV stable and can fade in bright sunshine over time, and may therefore not be suitable for all locations.

== 19th century precursors ==
=== Falconnier ===
Modern glass bricks were preceded by Falconnier Hollow Glass Bricks in the late nineteenth century. Falconnier Bricks were blown glass bricks available in multiple colors and were formed in molds while the glass was molten. They could be used for walls or roofs and were joined with wire and cement. The suggested use for Falconnier glass bricks was in greenhouse construction due to the non-conductivity of the glass for temperature control and lack of porosity of glass for moisture control. They were touted for not tarnishing, trapping dust, or retaining water.

=== Prisms ===
Vault lights in sidewalks, which utilized prism lighting, were one of the first steps towards the modern hollow glass brick. At the end of the nineteenth century glass prisms became a popular way to diffuse light into spaces that would otherwise be difficult or unsafe to light via flame-based oil lamps (e.g. basements underneath sidewalks).

==Examples of architectural use==
* Real-Time Control Building #3 in Edmonton, Canada.
* Crown Fountain in Chicago, United States.
* Maison de Verre (for House of Glass) in Paris, France
* Michigan State Capitol in Lansing, Michigan
* Hermès luxury retail space in Ginza, Tokyo, Japan by Renzo Piano
* Streamline Moderne
* Ibrox Stadium, Glasgow
* Österreichische Postsparkasse in Vienna, Austria by Otto Wagner

<text>Quilicura ( ; ) is a commune of Chile located in capital Santiago. Founded in 1901, it was originally a satellite city on what were then the outskirts of the city of Santiago, but as urban sprawl has set in it is now quickly urbanizing from what was recently prime agricultural land.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name Quilicura is from the Mapuche language Mapudungun and comes from the words &quot;kila&quot; meaning three and &quot;kura&quot; meaning stone. The &quot;Three Stones&quot; are three hills which separate the area and formed the border with Renca.

==Location==

Quilicura is located in Santiago Province, Santiago Metropolitan Region, at the northwestern edge of Chile&#x27;s capital Santiago. It borders Renca to the south (naturally separated by Renca Hill), Pudahuel to the west, Huechuraba and Conchalí to the east, and Lampa and Colina to the north.

There is little green space in comparison to wealthier neighborhoods in the city because Quilicura is still an industrial area.

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 census, Quilicura spans an area of and has 126,518 inhabitants (62,421 men and 64,097 women). Of these, 125,999 (99.6%) lived in urban areas and 519 (0.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 207.7% (85,397 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. According to the 2012 census preliminary data Quilicura is now home to 203,946 residents.

In 2005 the regional quality of life index was rated at a medium level of 72.53 or 34 out of 52. In 2003 Quilicura&#x27;s Human Development Index was recorded as 0.782 or 19 out of 341.

In 2011 the average annual household per capita income was rated at US$39,302 (PPP).

For the year 2017; according to the results of the 2017 census delivered by the National Institute of Statistics, the population of the commune increased to a total of 210 410 inhabitants, of which 103 456 (49%) correspond to men, while 106 954 (51%) correspond to women; therefore, its masculinity index is 96,7.

In recent years, Quilicura has become the home of a large Haitian community.

==Transport==

Quilicura is located about 12 km from Santiago&#x27;s international airport and is served by the Américo Vespucio Norte Highway as well as the Pan-American Highway. RED public buses connect Quilicura to the centre of Santiago and run frequently in each direction. The first phase of the Santiago Metro Line 3 connecting the commune with the rest of the network was completed on 22 January 2019, with phase 2 being completed in 2023. Currently, the closest metro station to Quilicura is Los Libertadores which is the northern terminus of the line 3.

==Administration==
As a commune, Quilicura is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by a mayor who is directly-elected every four years. The 2021-2024 mayor is Paulina Bobadilla Navarrete (Ind./Comunes). The communal council has the following members:

<doc id="1090870" wikidata="Q1047239" url="?curid=1090870" title="Days Inn">
<text>Days Inn is a hotel chain headquartered in the United States. It was founded in 1970 by Cecil B. Day, who opened the first location in Tybee Island, Georgia. The brand is now a part of the Wyndham Hotels and Resorts, headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, which used to be a part of Cendant. As of December 31, 2023, Days Inn includes 1,501 locations worldwide with 114,216 rooms.

==History==
Founder Cecil B. Day, before creating Days Inn, had worked in real estate in Atlanta, Georgia, where he built and developed apartment complexes. He also owned several locations of the fast food chains Jiffy Drive-In and Carrols in Atlanta. Day sold his holdings to Phipps Land Company for $14 million in 1969, the largest real estate transaction in the state of Georgia at the time.

Day founded Days Inn on Tybee Island, Georgia, in 1970. He proposed the idea as a means of using a piece of land he owned on the island. When the first Days Inn opened, Day could not find maid service, so he had his children make up the rooms&#x27; beds. Also, a truck that delivered furniture was too heavy for the bridge onto the island, so Day&#x27;s mother hauled furniture onto the island in her station wagon. Despite the criticism that Day faced from friends for wanting to start a new lodging option on a &quot;no-name island&quot; with a flagging tourist economy, the first Days Inn was 100 percent occupied by April 1970. The first property featured 60 rooms and a price of $8 per room. Throughout most of the 1970s, the Inns were referred to as 8 Days Inn with pricing starting at $8.88 per room. As costs increased, the 8 was removed from advertising and signage. 

Later in 1970, Day opened the second location, in Forsyth, Georgia. During a heavy rainstorm a week before construction was completed and the planned opening day, about 20 travelers were allowed to stay at the property, at Day&#x27;s insistence despite unfinished rooms. Three nights later all 120 rooms were occupied. Through the 1970s hotel guests could take home a paperback Bible (usually the American Bible Society Good News Bible New Testament) from their guest rooms for free. Days Inn of America, Inc. began franchising hotels in 1972 and within eight years created a system of more than 300 hotels in the United States, Mexico, and Canada.

Stanley S. Tollman and Monty D. Hundley, via the Tollman-Hundley Hotel Group, became the largest franchisees in the 1980s and bought Days Inn of America. In 1991, they took it into bankruptcy and then sold it to Hospitality Franchise Systems. Tollman and Hundley were indicted on federal bank fraud and tax fraud charges because they had not disclosed all assets in the process. Tollman fled to London in 2002, where he fought extradition for many years. In 2008, he agreed to a plea deal that would allow him to return home in exchange for more than $100 million.

In August of 2022, a mass shooting took place in and outside of a Days Inn in Phoenix, Arizona. Two were killed and 5 others were injured before the shooter committed suicide.

==Concepts==
Starting with the second location in Forsyth, many Days Inns featured a restaurant and gift shop combination called Tasty World. Day refused to sell alcohol at Tasty World restaurants. Day did not drink alcohol and decided to target families with the brand. He noted that his refusal was criticized by bankers, who felt that including a bar would increase profits. Forsyth and many properties after it also featured on-site gasoline pumps to sell unbranded fuel to motel guests. Day, who was a devout Christian, also offered a network of chaplains to provide ministry at each motel.

Days Inn was one of the first hotel chains to offer discounts to senior citizens. It was also among the first to locate its properties along suburban and rural exits on the Interstate Highway System, as opposed to more urban locations.

==Brands==
The hotel brands of Days Inn include:

*Days Inn and Days Inn &amp; Suites – Full- or limited-service. Some properties are only rooms; others have rooms mixed with suites.
*Days Hotel – full-service variant found in high-traffic and large cities.
*Days Suites – all-suites variant; may be either full- or limited-service.
*Days Lodge – a short lived chain of lodges.
*Days Park – for recreational vehicles and motor homes.
*Daystop – a budget chain started in 1990 in Lakeville, Minnesota.

==Days Inn in the United Kingdom==

In the UK, the top four motorway service operators have Days Inn hotels. Welcome Break brought the Days Inn brand to the UK under a licence from a US company. It used to have one at each service station with a hotel. However, some have been converted to Ramada. Welcome Break also run a couple of non-motorway hotels, one of which is in Milton Keynes. Additionally, some locations are operated on behalf of Extra Services. Roadchef also maintains Days Inn Hotels at most of their sites. Days Inn and Moto Hospitality have experimented with two hotels in Wetherby and Winchester.

<doc id="1090884" wikidata="Q2153351" url="?curid=1090884" title="Rincon (surfspot)">
<text>Rincon &quot;(Spanish,&quot; &quot;angle&quot; or &quot;corner&quot;&quot;)&quot; is a surf spot located at the Ventura and Santa Barbara County line in Southern California, United States. Also known as the &quot;Queen of the Coast&quot;, Rincon is one of the most famous surf spots in California, known around the world for its well-formed waves and long rides. The book &quot;100 Best Surf Spots in the World&quot; rates Rincon at 24. It is best at low tide during the winter months when swells are coming mostly from the west and northwest. There is a gated residential community that occupies most of the Rincon beachfront. Public access is provided at parking lots on both sides of the gated community, with restrooms and a picnic area in the upper parking lot, Rincon Beach Park.

Rincon Point is home to the Rincon Classic surf championship scheduled for January each year. The championship draws local surf greats and spectators to the beach every year. Though scheduled for January, the event is often delayed until surf conditions merit a contest. Once these surf conditions are met the contest is held from Saturday through Sunday. There are multiple divisions ranging from the Legends (55+) to the gremlins (U12). There are nine divisions for the men, including the pro division, while there are 2 divisions for the women. The pro division mainly consists of local professional surfers including world surf league competitor Conner Coffin who competes in the contest almost every year. The contest is open to the public and local residents receive priority registration based on their county . During the contest local restaurants provide lunch for the competitors and also sell food to the public. These restaurants include Nutbelly and Rincon Brewery.

==Geography and ecology==

Rincon is located along U.S. Route 101 at Bates Road. It is divided into three parts: the Cove, Rivermouth, and Indicator. The cove is the best part of the point and is the closest to the freeway. Rivermouth is the fastest section of the wave reaching from the mouth of Rincon Creek to the large white/stone house. Tube rides occur mainly at Rivermouth at low tide. Indicator is at the top of the point, visually obstructed from the freeway. While Rincon is most famous for its long right-breaking waves, Indicator also produces some extremely fast left-breaking waves during the summer, when southerly swells are most prevalent. During a larger westerly swell, all three sections often connect into one contiguous ridable wave.

Because of the quality of the wave, people travel from all over the world to surf there, sometimes resulting in extremely crowded surfing conditions. There have been occasional deaths at Rincon, mostly resulting from surfers getting caught at the bottom of the cove at higher tides during larger swells and getting thrown into the granite boulders which support the nearby freeway.

Environmentally, Rincon Creek has a tendency to flow higher levels of bacteria into the surf zone during heavy rains, resulting in occasional beach closures.

==History==
In 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition came west along the beach from the previous night&#x27;s encampment at Pitas Point. The explorers found a large native village at a watering place near the mouth what is now called &quot;Rincon Creek&quot;, and camped nearby on August 16. Fray Juan Crespi, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, noted that &quot;As soon as we arrived all the people came to visit us, and brought us a great supply of roasted fish to eat&quot; The 1775 (second) expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza camped at the same place, referring to the native village as &quot;La Rinconada&quot;.

In 1835, the area was included in a land grant called Rancho El Rincon. The grant extended along the coast on both sides of the Santa Barbara/Ventura county line, and encompassed present-day Rincon Point, Rincon State Beach and La Conchita.

<text>Vincent Joseph Fumo (born May 8, 1943) is an American politician, lawyer, and businessman from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A Democrat, he represented a South Philadelphia district in the Pennsylvania Senate from 1978 to 2008. On March 16, 2009, he was convicted of 137 federal corruption charges. On July 14, 2009, he was sentenced to 55 months in federal prison.

==Early life and education==
Fumo holds a B.S. degree from Villanova University (1964), a Juris Doctor degree from Temple University School of Law (1972), and an MBA (1984) from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He served on the board of trustees of the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, a museum dedicated to the U.S. Constitution.

==Career==
In 1974, Fumo, along with three associates, was the target of a 44 count indictment for mail fraud. The four men, who included the Majority Leader of the State Senate, the head of the Democratic City Executive Committee, and the Chief Clerk of the State House were accused of helping convicted Senator Henry Cianfrani, add 33 ghost employees to the state payroll. At the time, Fumo was an assistant to Peter Camiel in charge of patronage.

In 1978, Fumo was convicted by a jury of 15 counts. However, a federal judge overturned the conviction in 1981 after motions by the defense to acquit.

===Politics===
Fumo represented South Philadelphia&#x27;s 1st Senatorial District beginning in 1978 when he succeeded Buddy Cianfrani, who had been convicted of racketeering, bribery and obstruction of justice.

A powerful State Senator, the &quot;Pennsylvania Report&quot; said that &quot;[i]t is difficult to catalog and characterize all of his tie-ins and tentacles at all levels of government, but having him on your side in a pitched battle rattles opponents.&quot; In 2002, the political website PoliticsPA named him to the list of &quot;Smartest Legislators,&quot; calling him &quot;[a]rguably the smartest legislator in Harrisburg.&quot;

Fumo was the ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee until his federal indictment in February 2007. He also served on the Communications &amp; Technology, Consumer Protection, Game &amp; Fisheries, Rules, &amp; Urban Affairs &amp; Housing Committees.

===Business===
In addition to his State Senate work, Fumo is associated with the Philadelphia Law firm of Dilworth Paxson LLP. He was the Chairman of First Penn Bank. The bank was founded as Pennsylvania Savings Bank, by his grandfather. Fumo took over control after his father was convicted of bank fraud in 1976. The bank grew rapidly under Fumo&#x27;s control from $1.5 million in assets to about $550 million, and was eventually sold in 2007 for $94 million, potentially netting $19 million for Fumo.

Fumo was hospitalized on March 2, 2008, after suffering a heart attack at his home. He underwent a successful emergency angioplasty at Hahnemann University Hospital and was released on March 9, 2008.

On March 12, 2008, Fumo announced he was dropping his bid for reelection and retiring from public service, citing his federal indictment.

On March 16, 2009, a Philadelphia Federal jury convicted Fumo on 137 counts of corruption, conspiracy, fraud and more.

===2009 conviction===

Fumo was the subject of a federal investigation, which resulted in his indictment in 2007. The investigation related to a charity, run by a former member of Fumo&#x27;s staff, the Citizens Alliance for Better Neighborhoods. In 2004, PECO, a subsidiary of Exelon, donated $17 million to the organization. Federal prosecutors began an investigation as to whether Fumo had forced the utility to make the donation by initially opposing, then supporting, utility deregulation in the state. There were also allegations that Fumo had used the charity&#x27;s funds for personal benefit. Fumo also suggested that Verizon hire a law firm, Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell &amp; Hippel, for a three-year, $3 million retainer to handle legal work. The chair of Obermayer&#x27;s litigation committee, Thomas Leonard, was a prominent Democrat who served as the city&#x27;s controller in the 1990s and attended Temple University Law School with Fumo in the 1970s; both remained friends since then and worked together on fundraising for Democratic candidates.

In late May 2006, two of Fumo&#x27;s staffers were arrested and indicted on charges of destroying electronic evidence, including e-mail related to the investigation. The charges were based on e-mails sent by the aides, in which they suggested that Fumo ordered destruction of the documentation.

On February 6, 2007, a Federal grand jury named Fumo in a 137 count indictment, alleging mail fraud, wire fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and filing a false tax return. Charges include using state workers to oversee construction of his mansion, spying on his ex-wife, and work on his farm. Additionally, the indictment accused him of misusing $1 million of state funds and $1 million from his charity for personal and campaign use and commandeering yachts from the Philadelphia Seaport Museum for personal travel.

Immediately before the indictment was handed down, Fumo resigned his position as the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and vowed to fight the charges.

On March 12, 2008, at a press conference at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, Fumo announced he was dropping his bid for reelection under stress, saying that the charges against him left &quot;a cloud hanging over [his] head.&quot; He did, however, complete his final term in the Senate, which ended at the end of the year. This was reportedly at the insistence of Governor Ed Rendell who was present at the press conference. Fumo also added that the decision had nothing to do with his health issues.

On March 16, 2009, he was found guilty of all 137 counts of corruption and was facing a minimum of ten years in prison. His former aide, Ruth Arnao, was also found guilty of all 45 counts against her.

On July 14, 2009, Fumo was sentenced to 55 months in prison, substantially below the sentencing guidelines of 11 to 14 years. On November 11, 2011, upon a judicial review of his sentence, his prison term was increased by six months and the amount of his court-ordered restitution payment was increased by $1.1 million.

====Incarceration====
The Federal Bureau of Prisons ordered Fumo to report to Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland, near Ashland, Kentucky, by August 2009. Fumo was released from prison in August 2013.

<text>was a after Jōkyō and before Hōei. The Genroku period spanned the years from September 1688 to March 1704. The reigning emperor was .

The period was known for its peace and prosperity, as the previous hundred years of peace and seclusion in Japan had created relative economic stability. The arts and architecture flourished. There were unanticipated consequences when the shogunate debased the quality of coins as a strategy for financing the appearance of continuing Genroku affluence. This strategic miscalculation caused abrupt inflation. Then, in an effort to solve the ensuing crisis, the introduced what were called the Kyōhō Reforms.

==Change of era==
The was 1688. The new era name was created to mark the beginning of the reign of Higashiyama. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in Jōkyō 5, on the 30th day of the 9th month.

<text>Around the World with Orson Welles is a series of six short travelogues originally written and directed by Orson Welles for Associated-Rediffusion in 1955, for Britain&#x27;s then-new ITV channel. Despite its title emphasizing the world, it was entirely filmed in Europe. Among other incidents in the episodes, Welles visited Jean Cocteau and Juliette Gréco in Paris, attended a bullfight in Madrid (with co-hosts Kenneth Tynan and Elaine Dundy) and visited the Basque Country.

==Production==
In March 1955, Associated-Rediffusion had originally commissioned a series of 26 half-hour programmes, but in the end, only 6 were broadcast, and even then, in rather troubled circumstances. Before a contract had even been signed, Welles had rapidly shot a pilot episode himself (the third episode broadcast, &quot;Revisiting Vienna&quot;) using loaned money and on the basis of an informal agreement. As Welles had made an agreement with producer Louis Dolivet in 1953 to work exclusively for him (beginning with their troubled film production &quot;Mr. Arkadin&quot;), Dolivet was brought on board as the series producer.

The filming schedule was ambitious. Once the contract was signed, Welles was expected to make a further 25 episodes in 25 weeks spread out over nine months, with the first broadcast scheduled for September 1955. However, Welles&#x27;s other commitments interfered with his ability to meet deadlines, and much of the series was left incomplete. Welles spent much of 1955 working on writing, directing and acting in his London stage production &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot;, and after that flopped on the West End, he switched to shooting an (aborted) film adaptation of the play, first in London, and then in Rome – filming &quot;Moby Dick—Rehearsed&quot; in Rome was under the pretext of working on the &quot;Around the World with Orson Welles&quot; TV series.

Although Associated-Rediffusion retained a number of rights, including approval of episode synopses, script approval, music approval, and viewing rights for the rushes and final cut, film scholars Jean-Pierre Berthomé and Francois Thomas argue that Welles remained in control much of the time, due to the fragmentary, piecemeal way in which much of the footage was shot, with the writer/director/presenter being the only person who could piece it all together. For instance, Welles shot most of his interviews with only one camera, focussed on the interviewee, and all of the reverse shots of him asking questions had to be shot later in a studio. Frequently, Welles&#x27;s entire episodes would be heavily studio-dependent; his entire participation in an episode on bullfighting consisted of filming himself entering and sitting down at a bullfight, then filming the bullfight; and the reconstructing part of the audience seats in a studio, so he could record his bullfight commentary months after having watched it.

The first episode missed its initial broadcast deadline, and it was still not finished when it went out the following month – Welles had to provide the voiceover himself, live from Rome, when it was broadcast in the UK. The second episode was missing a voiceover in several sections. The third and fifth episodes, were the most complete.

Welles had effectively abandoned the production to move back to the USA at the end of 1955, so the fourth and sixth episodes were particularly badly hit. Episode four, on the Paris district of St. Germain des Prés, had to be padded out with stock footage from other documentaries. Episode six had only half the necessary footage, so it was padded out by having two friends of Welles&#x27;s, Kenneth Tynan and Elaine Dundy (who had been present at the same bullfight he recorded), become guest hosts for the first half of the episode, until the existing footage of Welles could be used. The seventh episode was not originally completed or broadcast.

==Episodes==
For many years, it was believed that the third episode, &quot;Revisiting Vienna&quot;, also known as &quot;The Third Man Returns to Vienna&quot;, (Welles starred in &quot;The Third Man&quot; in 1949) was lost. In June 2011, the episode was found in the archives at the Wisconsin Historical Society Center for Film and Theater Research in Madison, Wisconsin by Ray Langstone, completing the series.

Orson Welles also worked on a seventh episode entitled &quot;The Tragedy of Lurs&quot;, which was not completed. The documentary was based on the controversial Dominici murder case in France, and contained interviews with many of the principals shortly after the trial. A version of the film, using Welles&#x27;s footage and additional sound, was constructed by French filmmaker Christophe Cognet and integrated into his 52-minute documentary titled &quot;The Dominici Affair by Orson Welles&quot; (2000).

==Home video release==
Sets containing what were then thought to be the five sole surviving broadcast episodes and &quot;The Dominici Affair&quot; were separately released on both VHS and DVD. Then, in 2015, to mark the centenary of Welles&#x27;s birth, the British Film Institute released both DVD and limited-edition Blu-ray sets containing all six broadcast episodes and &quot;The Dominici Affair by Orson Welles&quot;.
