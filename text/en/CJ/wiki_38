<text>1860s fashion in European and European-influenced countries is characterized by extremely full-skirted women&#x27;s fashions relying on crinolines and hoops and the emergence of &quot;alternative fashions&quot; under the influence of the Artistic Dress movement.

In men&#x27;s fashion, the three-piece &quot;ditto suit&quot; of sack coat, waistcoat, and trousers in the same fabric emerged as a novelty.

==Women&#x27;s fashions==
=== Colors ===

Mauveine Aniline dyes (first chemical dyes) were discovered in 1856 and were quickly utilized to make use of fashionable colors to fabrics. The first ones were mauve and bright purple. In 1860, two fashionable brilliant pink aniline dyes were named after battles in Italy&#x27;s fight for independence: magenta, named after the Italian town of Magenta, Lombardy, and the similar solferino, named after Solferino. Magenta was popularized in England by the Duchess of Sutherland after she was appealed to by the Spitalfields silk weavers.

===Gowns===
By the early 1860s, skirts had reached their ultimate width. After about 1862 the silhouette of the crinoline changed and rather than being bell-shaped it was now flatter at the front and projected out more behind. This large area was largely occupied by all manner of decoration. Puffs and strips could cover much of the skirt. There could be so many flounces that the material of the skirt itself was hardly visible. Lace again became popular and was used all over the dress. Any part of the dress could also be embroidered in silver or gold. This massive construct of a dress required gauze lining to stiffen it, as well as multiple starched petticoats. Even the clothes women would ride horses in received these sorts of embellishments.
Day dresses featured wide pagoda sleeves worn over undersleeves or engageantes. High necklines with lace or tatted collars or chemisettes completed the demure daytime look.

Gowns had low necklines and short sleeves, and were worn with short gloves or lace or crocheted fingerless mitts. The voluminous skirts were supported by hoops, petticoats, and or crinolines. The use of hoops was not as common until 1856, prior supporting the skirts with layers of starched petticoats. Large crinolines were probably reserved for special occasions.

Skirts were now assembled of shaped panels, since gathering a straight length of fabric could not provide the width required at the hem without unwanted bulk at the waist; this spelled the end of the brief fashion for border-printed dress fabrics.
Heavy silks in solid colors became fashionable for both day and evening wear, and a skirt might be made with two bodices, one long-sleeved and high necked for afternoon wear and one short-sleeved and low-necked for evening. The bodices themselves were often triangular, and featured a two-piece front with a closure and a three-piece back construction.

As the decade progressed, sleeves narrowed, and the circular hoops of the 1850s decreased in size at the front and sides and increased at the back. Looped up overskirts revealed matching or contrasting underskirts, a look that would reach its ultimate expression the next two decades with the rise of the bustle. Waistlines rose briefly at the end of the decade.

Fashions were adopted more slowly in America than in Europe. It was not uncommon for fashion plates to appear in American women&#x27;s magazines a year or more after they appeared in Paris or London.

Long coats were impractical with the very full skirts, and the common outer garments were square shawls folded on the diagonal to make a triangle and fitted or unfitted hip-length or knee-length jackets.

Three-quarter-length capes (with or without sleeves) were also worn.

For walking, jackets were accompanied by floor-length skirts that could be looped or drawn up by means of tapes over a shorter petticoat.

===Undergarments===

As skirts became narrower and flatter in front, more emphasis was placed on the waist and hips. A corset was therefore used to help mold the body to the desired shape. This was achieved by making the corsets longer than before, and by constructing them from separate shaped pieces of fabric. To increase rigidity, they were reinforced with many strips of whalebone, cording, or pieces of leather. As well as making corsets more constricting, this heavy structure helped prevent them from riding up, or from wrinkling at the waist. Steam-molding also helped create a curvaceous contour. Developed by Edwin Izod in the late 1860s, the procedure involved placing a corset, wet with starch, on a steam heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. While tight lacing continued to be a hotly debated topic among moralists and physicians, most extreme descriptions came from male sexual fantasies.

The crinoline or hooped petticoat had grown to its maximum dimensions by 1860. As huge skirts began to fall from favor, around 1864, the shape of the crinoline began to change. Rather than being dome-shaped, the front and sides began to contract, leaving volume only at the back. The &quot;American&quot; cage, a hooped petticoat partially covered in fabric, came in bright colors made possible by the new aniline dyes. This was followed by a hybrid of the bustle and crinoline sometimes called a &quot;crinolette&quot;. The cage structure was still attached around the waist and extended down to the ground, but only extended down the back of the wearer&#x27;s legs. The crinolette itself was quickly superseded by the true bustle, which was sufficient for supporting the drapery and train at the back of the skirt. Under the corset, a chemise was worn. A chemise is typically short sleeve and knee length made of linen or cotton. The chemise and stockings worn were meant to soak up any perspiration and protecting the outer clothing. Due to the many layers of dress, the women of the southern elite would take short naps to rest from wearing their large dress and escape the harsh southern heat and the constraining whalebone corsets.

===Military and political influences===
The Garibaldi shirt or &quot;Garibaldi jacket&quot; was popularized by Empress Eug√©nie of France in 1860. These bright red woolen garments featured black embroidery or braid and military details. Following a visit by the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Garibaldi to England in 1863, the shirt became all the rage there. In America, the early years of the Civil War also saw increased popularity of military-influenced styles such as Zouave jackets. These new styles were worn over a &quot;waist&quot; (blouse) or chemisette and a skirt with a belt at the natural waistline. Women&#x27;s fashion overall was highly influenced by the reigning Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom.

===Rise of &quot;haute couture&quot;===

The Englishman Charles Frederick Worth had established his first fashion house in Paris in 1858. He was the first couturier, a dressmaker considered an artist, and his ability to dictate design in the 1860s led to the dominance of Parisian haute couture for the next hundred years.

===Artistic dress===
The followers of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and other artistic reformers objected to the elaborately trimmed confections of high fashion with their emphasis on rigid corsets and hoops as both ugly and dishonest. An &quot;anti-fashion&quot; for Artistic dress spread in the 1860s in literary and artistic circles, and remained an undercurrent for the rest of the century. The style was characterised by &quot;medieval&quot; influences such as juliette sleeves, the soft colors of vegetable dyes, narrow skirts, and simple ornamentation with hand embroidery. Material used in the southern American elite were silk, velvet, muslin and fine lawn.

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Hair was worn parted in the middle and smoothed, waved, or poofed over the ears, then braided or &quot;turned up&quot; and pinned into a roll or low bun at the back of the neck. Such styling was usually maintained by the use of hair oils and pomades. Styled hair was often further confined in decorative hairnets, especially by younger women. (NOTE: Although many modern reenactors refer to this garment as a &quot;snood&quot;, it is not a period term for this article of clothing; snoods were something else entirely.) These hairnets were frequently made of very fine material to match the wearer&#x27;s natural hair color, but occasionally more elaborate versions were made of thin strips of velvet or chenille (sometimes decorated with beads). Whether plain or resplendent, many hairnets were edged with ruchings of ribbon that would serve to adorn the crown of the wearer&#x27;s head.
Fashion bonnets for outdoor wear had small brims that revealed the face. Earlier bonnets of the decade had lower brims. However, by mid-century Spoon Bonnets, which featured increasingly high brims and more elaborate trimmings, became the vogue. Bonnets were made specifically to accessorize a dress. Other less common variants, such as the Marie Stuart Bonnet, with its heart-shaped brim, and the fanchon bonnet, with its very short brim and back curtain, made appearances in the realm of fashionable headwear.

Bonnets could be made of a variety of materials. Bonnets formed from buckram and wire and covered with fashion fabric were very popular. During the warmer seasons, bonnets made of straw, woven horsehair, or gathered net were also seen. Heavier materials like velvet were favored for winter bonnets, though quilted winter hoods were much more practical and warm.

Trimmings varied according to the changing styles and whims of the individual wearer, but most bonnets of the period followed some general rules with regards to form. Rows of gathered net lining the brim was a fashion carry-over from the decade before, and a decorative curtain (also referred to as a &quot;bavolet&quot;) appeared on most bonnets in order to shade the wearer&#x27;s neck and accommodate for the low hairstyles. Another standard of 1860s bonnets is bonnet ties. There were often two sets, a thin pair of &quot;utility ties&quot; to take the strain of tying the bonnet, and another set of wide ties of silk or another fancy material. These rich ties were tied below the chin in a bow or left untied to show off the beautiful print or material.

Bonnets fell out of fashion over the decade in favor of small hats.

==Men&#x27;s fashion==

Men&#x27;s fashion saw continuous changes from the previous decade.

Shirts of linen or cotton featured high upstanding or turnover collars, and neckties grew wider and were tied in a bow or looped into a loose knot and fastened with a stickpin. Heavy padded and fitted frock coats (in French redingotes), now usually single-breasted and knee length, were worn for business occasions, over waistcoats or vests with lapels and notched collars. Waistcoats were generally cut straight across the front and had lapels. 

Notably the familiar &#x27;four-in-hand&#x27; tie ubiquitous in the modern three-piece suit emerged as a popular style in this decade. Detachable collars, invented in 1827, were widely the norm for men.

The loosely fitted, mid-thigh length &quot;sack coat&quot; continued to slowly displace the frock coat for less-formal business occasions, and was often sported for holidays and informal day-to-day events. The decade is recognized for the emergence of the popularity of the modern suit formed by a sack coat with matching trousers and waistcoats, though the sack coat previously dated to the 1840s.

The slightly cutaway morning coat was still worn for formal day occasions. The most formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers, with a white cravat; this costume was well on its way to crystallizing into the modern &quot;white tie and tails.&quot; While during the first half of the decade the waist was long, after 1865 the waist became shorter, with pockets in the pleats.

Full-length trousers were worn, generally of a contrasting fabric. Costumes consisting of a coat, waistcoat and trousers of the same fabric (called a &quot;ditto suit&quot;) remained a novelty at this time. In domestic settings, the sack coat or a lounge jacket could be worn with a waistcoat and trousers of the same fabric. This form of ditto suit, referred to as a lounge suit in the United Kingdom was generally made of wool, with baggy tailoring. However, the lounge suit was not considered appropriate for public settings until the 1870s.

Overcoats had wide lapels and deep cuffs, and often featured contrasting velvet collars.

Top hats briefly became the very tall &quot;stovepipe&quot; shape, but a variety of other hat shapes were popular. During this time, the bowler hat gained popularity as an informal hat. This new type of hat was normally made of felt, black for most of the year or brown for the summer months.

In 1865 hatmaker John B. Stetson invented the Boss of the Plains hat. It gained immediate success in the Old West among cowboys and settlers, due to its practicality. It had a vaguely round ribbon-lined crown and a wide brim, originally straight but soon becoming stylized into the iconic rim of the typical cowboy hat. Its dense felt could be rugged enough to carry water.

==Children&#x27;s fashion==
Both boys and girls wore skirts from the time they could walk until they reached age 5 or 6.
Very small girls wore their skirts just below knee-length over pantalettes. Skirts became very gradually longer as girls grew up until they reached ankle length at coming-out (in their later teens, usually 16‚Äì18). Older girls wore hoops to hold out their skirts. Young girls wore washable pinafores over their dresses for work and play to keep them clean, as typified by the eponymous heroine of Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 novel, and her Alice in Wonderland dress.

Boys wore simple jackets and trousers.

<doc id="1092713" wikidata="Q774123" url="?curid=1092713" title="Approximation theory">
<text>In mathematics, approximation theory is concerned with how functions can best be approximated with simpler functions, and with quantitatively characterizing the errors introduced thereby. What is meant by &quot;best&quot; and &quot;simpler&quot; will depend on the application.

A closely related topic is the approximation of functions by generalized Fourier series, that is, approximations based upon summation of a series of terms based upon orthogonal polynomials.

One problem of particular interest is that of approximating a function in a computer mathematical library, using operations that can be performed on the computer or calculator (e.g. addition and multiplication), such that the result is as close to the actual function as possible. This is typically done with polynomial or rational (ratio of polynomials) approximations.

The objective is to make the approximation as close as possible to the actual function, typically with an accuracy close to that of the underlying computer&#x27;s floating point arithmetic. This is accomplished by using a polynomial of high degree, and/or narrowing the domain over which the polynomial has to approximate the function.
Narrowing the domain can often be done through the use of various addition or scaling formulas for the function being approximated. Modern mathematical libraries often reduce the domain into many tiny segments and use a low-degree polynomial for each segment.

==Optimal polynomials==
Once the domain (typically an interval) and degree of the polynomial are chosen, the polynomial itself is chosen in such a way as to minimize the worst-case error. That is, the goal is to minimize the maximum value of formula_1, where &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the approximating polynomial, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the actual function, and &quot;x&quot; varies over the chosen interval. For well-behaved functions, there exists an &quot;N&quot;th-degree polynomial that will lead to an error curve that oscillates back and forth between formula_2 and formula_3 a total of &quot;N&quot;+2 times, giving a worst-case error of formula_4. It is seen that there exists an &quot;N&quot;th-degree polynomial that can interpolate &quot;N&quot;+1 points in a curve. That such a polynomial is always optimal is asserted by the equioscillation theorem. It is possible to make contrived functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for which no such polynomial exists, but these occur rarely in practice.

For example, the graphs shown to the right show the error in approximating log(x) and exp(x) for &quot;N&quot;¬†=¬†4. The red curves, for the optimal polynomial, are level, that is, they oscillate between formula_2 and formula_3 exactly. In each case, the number of extrema is &quot;N&quot;+2, that is, 6. Two of the extrema are at the end points of the interval, at the left and right edges of the graphs.

 To prove this is true in general, suppose &quot;P&quot; is a polynomial of degree &quot;N&quot; having the property described, that is, it gives rise to an error function that has &quot;N&quot;¬†+¬†2 extrema, of alternating signs and equal magnitudes. The red graph to the right shows what this error function might look like for &quot;N&quot;¬†=¬†4. Suppose &quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (whose error function is shown in blue to the right) is another &quot;N&quot;-degree polynomial that is a better approximation to &quot;f&quot; than &quot;P&quot;. In particular, &quot;Q&quot; is closer to &quot;f&quot; than &quot;P&quot; for each value &quot;xi&quot; where an extreme of &quot;P&quot;‚àí&quot;f&quot; occurs, so
:formula_7
When a maximum of &quot;P&quot;‚àí&quot;f&quot; occurs at &quot;xi&quot;, then
:formula_8
And when a minimum of &quot;P&quot;‚àí&quot;f&quot; occurs at &quot;xi&quot;, then
:formula_9
So, as can be seen in the graph, [&quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)¬†‚àí¬†&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)]¬†‚àí¬†[&quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)¬†‚àí¬†&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)] must alternate in sign for the &quot;N&quot;¬†+¬†2 values of &quot;xi&quot;. But [&quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)¬†‚àí¬†&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)]¬†‚àí¬†[&quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)¬†‚àí¬†&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)] reduces to &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)¬†‚àí¬†&quot;Q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) which is a polynomial of degree &quot;N&quot;. This function changes sign at least &quot;N&quot;+1 times so, by the Intermediate value theorem, it has &quot;N&quot;+1 zeroes, which is impossible for a polynomial of degree &quot;N&quot;.

==Chebyshev approximation==
One can obtain polynomials very close to the optimal one by expanding the given function in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and then cutting off the expansion at the desired degree.
This is similar to the Fourier analysis of the function, using the Chebyshev polynomials instead of the usual trigonometric functions.

If one calculates the coefficients in the Chebyshev expansion for a function:

:formula_10

and then cuts off the series after the formula_11 term, one gets an &quot;N&quot;th-degree polynomial approximating &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

The reason this polynomial is nearly optimal is that, for functions with rapidly converging power series, if the series is cut off after some term, the total error arising from the cutoff is close to the first term after the cutoff. That is, the first term after the cutoff dominates all later terms. The same is true if the expansion is in terms of bucking polynomials. If a Chebyshev expansion is cut off after formula_11, the error will take a form close to a multiple of formula_13. The Chebyshev polynomials have the property that they are level ‚Äì they oscillate between +1 and ‚àí1 in the interval [‚àí1, 1]. formula_13 has &quot;N&quot;+2 level extrema. This means that the error between &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and its Chebyshev expansion out to formula_11 is close to a level function with &quot;N&quot;+2 extrema, so it is close to the optimal &quot;N&quot;th-degree polynomial.

In the graphs above, the blue error function is sometimes better than (inside of) the red function, but sometimes worse, meaning that it is not quite the optimal polynomial. The discrepancy is less serious for the exp function, which has an extremely rapidly converging power series, than for the log function.

Chebyshev approximation is the basis for Clenshaw‚ÄìCurtis quadrature, a numerical integration technique.

==Remez&#x27;s algorithm==
The Remez algorithm (sometimes spelled Remes) is used to produce an optimal polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) approximating a given function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) over a given interval. It is an iterative algorithm that converges to a polynomial that has an error function with &quot;N&quot;+2 level extrema. By the theorem above, that polynomial is optimal.

Remez&#x27;s algorithm uses the fact that one can construct an &quot;N&quot;th-degree polynomial that leads to level and alternating error values, given &quot;N&quot;+2 test points.

Given &quot;N&quot;+2 test points formula_16, formula_17, ... formula_18 (where formula_16 and formula_18 are presumably the end points of the interval of approximation), these equations need to be solved:

:formula_21

The right-hand sides alternate in sign.

That is,

:formula_22

Since formula_16, ..., formula_18 were given, all of their powers are known, and formula_25, ..., formula_26 are also known. That means that the above equations are just &quot;N&quot;+2 linear equations in the &quot;N&quot;+2 variables formula_27, formula_28, ..., formula_29, and formula_4. Given the test points formula_16, ..., formula_18, one can solve this system to get the polynomial &quot;P&quot; and the number formula_4.

The graph below shows an example of this, producing a fourth-degree polynomial approximating formula_34 over [‚àí1, 1]. The test points were set at
‚àí1, ‚àí0.7, ‚àí0.1, +0.4, +0.9, and 1. Those values are shown in green. The resultant value of formula_4 is 4.43 √ó 10‚àí4

The error graph does indeed take on the values formula_36 at the six test points, including the end points, but that those points are not extrema. If the four interior test points had been extrema (that is, the function &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) had maxima or minima there), the polynomial would be optimal.

The second step of Remez&#x27;s algorithm consists of moving the test points to the approximate locations where the error function had its actual local maxima or minima. For example, one can tell from looking at the graph that the point at ‚àí0.1 should have been at about ‚àí0.28. The way to do this in the algorithm is to use a single round of Newton&#x27;s method. Since one knows the first and second derivatives of , one can calculate approximately how far a test point has to be moved so that the derivative will be zero.

Calculating the derivatives of a polynomial is straightforward. One must also be able to calculate the first and second derivatives of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). Remez&#x27;s algorithm requires an ability to calculate formula_37, formula_38, and formula_39 to extremely high precision. The entire algorithm must be carried out to higher precision than the desired precision of the result.

After moving the test points, the linear equation part is repeated, getting a new polynomial, and Newton&#x27;s method is used again to move the test points again. This sequence is continued until the result converges to the desired accuracy. The algorithm converges very rapidly. Convergence is quadratic for well-behaved functions‚Äîif the test points are within formula_40 of the correct result, they will be approximately within formula_41 of the correct result after the next round.

Remez&#x27;s algorithm is typically started by choosing the extrema of the Chebyshev polynomial formula_13 as the initial points, since the final error function will be similar to that polynomial.

<doc id="1092718" wikidata="Q4299284" url="?curid=1092718" title="1890s in Western fashion">
<text>Fashion in the 1890s in Western countries is characterized by long elegant lines, tall collars, and the rise of sportswear. It was an era of great dress reforms led by the invention of the drop-frame safety bicycle, which allowed women the opportunity to ride bicycles more comfortably, and therefore, created the need for appropriate clothing.

Another great influence on women&#x27;s fashions of this era, particularly among those considered part of the Aesthetic Movement in America, was the political and cultural climate. Because women were taking a more active role in their communities, in the political world, and in society as a whole, their dress reflected this change. The more freedom to experience life outside the home that women of the Gilded Age acquired, the more freedom of movement was experienced in fashions as well. As the emphasis on athleticism influenced a change in garments which allowed for freedom of movement, the emphasis on less rigid gender roles influenced a change in dress which allowed for more self-expression, and a more natural silhouette of women&#x27;s bodies were revealed.

The 1890s brought the beginnings of a change in how fashion was presented as well. While illustrations still dominated fashion magazines, printed fashion photographs first appeared in French magazine La Mode Pratique in 1892, where they would continue be a weekly feature.

==Women&#x27;s fashions==

Fashionable women&#x27;s clothing styles shed some of the extravagances of previous decades (so that skirts were neither crinolined as in the 1850s, nor protrudingly bustled in back as in the late 1860s and mid-1880s, nor tight as in the late 1870s), but corseting continued unmitigated, or even slightly increased in severity. Early 1890s dresses consisted of a tight bodice with the skirt gathered at the waist and falling more naturally over the hips and undergarments than in previous years. Puffy leg-of-mutton sleeves (also known as &quot;gigot&quot; sleeves) made a comeback, growing bigger each year until reaching their largest size around 1895.

During the mid-1890s, skirts took on an A-line silhouette that was almost bell-like. The late 1890s returned to tighter sleeves often with small puffs or ruffles capping the shoulder but fitted to the wrist. Skirts took on a trumpet shape, fitting more closely over the hip and flaring just above the knee. Corsets in the 1890s helped define the hourglass figure as immortalized by artist Charles Dana Gibson. In the very late 1890s, the corset elongated, giving the women a slight S-bend silhouette that would be popular well into the Edwardian era.

===Sportswear and tailored fashions===

Changing attitudes about acceptable activities for women also made sportswear popular for women, with such notable examples as the bicycling dress and the tennis dress.

Unfussy, tailored clothes, adapted from the earlier theme of men&#x27;s tailoring and simplicity of form, were worn for outdoor activities and traveling. The shirtwaist, a costume with a bodice or &quot;waist&quot; tailored like a man&#x27;s shirt with a high collar, was adopted for informal daywear and became the uniform of working women. Walking suits featured ankle-length skirts with matching jackets. The notion of &quot;rational dress&quot; for women&#x27;s health was a widely discussed topic in 1891, which led to the development of sports dress. This included ample skirts with a belted blouse for hockey. In addition, cycling became very popular and led to the development of &quot;cycling costumes&quot;, which were shorter skirts or &quot;bloomers&quot; which were Turkish trouser style outfits. By the 1890s, women bicyclists increasingly wore bloomers in public and in the company of men as well as other women. Bloomers seem to have been more commonly worn in Paris than in England or the United States and became quite popular and fashionable. In the United States, bloomers were more intended for exercise than fashion. The rise of American women&#x27;s college sports in the 1890s created a need for more unencumbered movement than exercise skirts would allow. By the end of the decade, most colleges that admitted women had women&#x27;s basketball teams, all outfitted in bloomers. Across the nation&#x27;s campuses, baggy bloomers were paired with blouses to create the first women&#x27;s gym uniforms.

The rainy daisy was a style of walking or sports skirt introduced during this decade, allegedly named after Daisy Miller, but also named for its practicality in wet weather, as the shorter hemlines did not soak up puddles of water. They were particularly useful for cycling, walking or sporting pursuits as the shorter hems were less likely to catch in the bicycle mechanisms or underfoot, and enabled freer movement.

Swimwear was also developed, usually made of navy blue wool with a long tunic over full knickers.

Day dresses typical of the time period had high necks, wasp waists, puffed sleeves and bell-shaped skirts. Gowns had a squared decolletage, a wasp-waist cut and skirts with long trains.

===Influence of aesthetic dress===
The 1890s in both Europe and North America saw growing acceptance of artistic or aesthetic dress as mainstream fashion influenced by the philosophies of John Ruskin and William Morris. This was especially seen in the adoption of the uncorseted tea gown for at-home wear. In the United States during this period, &quot;Dress, the Jenness Miller Magazine&quot; (1887‚Äì1898) , reported that tea gowns were being worn outside the home for the first time in fashionable summer resorts.

Before women acquired a more prominent role outside the home, a more traditionally Victorian, restrained, and modest style of dress dominated. However, during the 1870s and 80s, the Aesthetic Movement led to a shift in behavior, with some women using fashion as a method of defying traditional domesticity and claiming agency.

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Hairstyles at the start of the decade were simply a carry-over from the 1880s styles that included curled or frizzled bangs over the forehead as well as hair swept to the top of the head, but after 1892, hairstyles became increasingly influenced by the Gibson Girl. By the mid-1890s, hair had become looser and wavier and bangs gradually faded from high fashion. By the end of the decade, hair was often worn in a large mass with a bun at the top of the head, a style that would be predominant during the first decade of the 20th century.

===Shoes===
High tab front shoes with a large buckle had made a comeback in the 1870s and were again revived in the 1890s. This popular style of shoe had a few names such as &quot;Cromwell,&quot; &quot;Colonial,&quot; and &quot;Moli√®re&quot;. At this time materials such as suede, leather, lace and metal were used to fashion the shoe and decorate it. Suede was new to the market in 1890 and was available in a few pale shades.

===Athletic wear===

The shift toward functional fashion also affected women&#x27;s athletic wear. Women in Paris began wearing bloomers when bicycling as early as 1893, while in England lower bicycle frames accommodated the dresses that women continued to wear for bicycling. Long floor length dresses gradually gave way to shorter hemlines and a more casual style of athletic clothing. Similarly, bathing suits also became shorter and less covered ‚Äî yet another example of the beginnings of a shift in dress toward greater freedom and functionality.

==Men&#x27;s fashion==
The overall silhouette of the 1890s was long, lean, and athletic. Hair was generally worn short, often with a pointed beard and generous moustache.

===Coats, jackets, and trousers===
By the 1890s, the sack coat (UK lounge coat) was fast replacing the frock coat for most informal and semi-formal occasions. Three-piece suits (&quot;ditto suits&quot;) consisting of a sack coat with matching waistcoat (U.S. &quot;vest&quot;) and trousers were worn, as were matching coat and waistcoat with contrasting trousers. Contrasting waistcoats were popular, and could be made with or without collars and lapels. The usual style was single-breasted.

The blazer, a navy blue or brightly colored or striped flannel coat cut like a sack coat with patch pockets and brass buttons, was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities.

The Norfolk jacket remained fashionable for shooting and rugged outdoor pursuits. It was made of sturdy tweed or similar fabric and featured paired box pleats over the chest and back, with a fabric belt. Worn with matching breeches (or U.S. knickerbockers), it became the &quot;Norfolk suit&quot;, suitable for bicycling or golf with knee-length stockings and low shoes, or for hunting with sturdy boots or shoes with leather gaiters.

The cutaway morning coat was still worn for formal day occasions in Europe and major cities elsewhere.

The most formal evening wear remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark or light waistcoat. Evening wear was worn with a white bow tie and a shirt with a winged collar.

The less formal dinner jacket or tuxedo, which featured a shawl collar with silk or satin facings, now generally had a single button. Dinner jackets were appropriate formal wear when &quot;dressing for dinner&quot; at home or at a men&#x27;s club. The dinner jacket was worn with a white shirt and a dark tie.

Knee-length topcoats, often with contrasting velvet or fur collars, and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter.

===Shirts and neckties===
Shirt collars were turned over or pressed into &quot;wings&quot;, and became taller through the decade. Dress shirts had stiff fronts, sometimes decorated with shirt studs and buttoned up the back. Striped shirts were popular for informal occasions.

The usual necktie was a four-in-hand or an Ascot tie, made up as a neckband with wide wings attached and worn with a stickpin, but the 1890s also saw the return of the bow tie (in various proportions) for day dress.

===Accessories===
As earlier in the century, top hats remained a requirement for upper class formal wear; bowlers and soft felt hats in a variety of shapes were worn for more casual occasions, and flat straw boaters were worn for yachting and at the seashore.

He also fought in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, the American Revolutionary War, and the War of 1812. While governor, he led the Kentucky militia in the Battle of the Thames, an action that was rewarded with a Congressional Gold Medal. Counties in nine states, and several cities and military bases, have been named in his honor. His fondness for John Dickinson&#x27;s &quot;The Liberty Song&quot; is believed to be the reason Kentucky adopted the state motto &quot;United we stand, divided we fall&quot;.

Issac Shelby&#x27;s military service began when he served as second-in-command to his father at the Battle of Point Pleasant, the only major battle of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War. He gained the reputation of an expert woodsman and surveyor and spent the early part of the Revolutionary War gathering supplies for the Continental Army. Later in the war, he and John Sevier led expeditions over the Appalachian Mountains against the British forces in North Carolina. He played a pivotal role in the British defeat at the Battle of Kings Mountain. For his service, Shelby was presented with a ceremonial sword and a pair of pistols by the North Carolina legislature, and the nickname &quot;Old Kings Mountain&quot; followed him the rest of his life.

Following the war, Isaac Shelby relocated to Kentucky on lands awarded to him for his military service and became involved in Kentucky&#x27;s transition from a county of Virginia to a separate state. His heroism made him popular with the state&#x27;s citizens, and the Kentucky electoral college unanimously elected him governor in 1792. He secured Kentucky from Indian attacks and organized its first government. He used the Citizen Gen√™t affair to convince the Washington administration to conclude an agreement with the Spanish Empire for free trade on the Mississippi River.

At the end of his gubernatorial term, Isaac Shelby retired from public life, but he was called back into politics by the impending War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily and, at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe&#x27;s offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, Shelby and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw Indian tribe. Isaac Shelby died at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky on July 18, 1826.

==Early life==
Isaac Shelby was born in the Colony of Maryland on December 11, 1750, near Hagerstown in Frederick (now Washington) County. He was the third child and second son of Evan and Letitia (Cox) Shelby, who immigrated from Tregaron, Wales, in 1735. Though the family had been loyal to the Church of England, they became Presbyterians after coming to British America; this was the denomination Isaac Shelby embraced during his life.

Shelby was educated at the local schools in his native colony. He worked on his father&#x27;s plantation and occasionally found work as a surveyor. At age eighteen he was appointed deputy sheriff of Frederick County. Shelby&#x27;s father lost a great deal of money when Pontiac&#x27;s Rebellion disrupted his lucrative fur trade business, and two years later, the business&#x27; records were destroyed in a house fire. Consequently, in December 1770 the family moved to the area near Bristol, Tennessee, where they built a fort and a trading post. Here, Shelby and his father worked for three years herding cattle.

==Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War==

During Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, a border conflict between colonists and American Indians, Isaac Shelby was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Virginia militia by Colonel William Preston. As second-in-command of his father&#x27;s Fincastle County company, he took part in the decisive Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774. The younger Shelby earned commendation for his skill and gallantry in this battle. The victorious militiamen erected Fort Blair on the site of the battle. They remained stationed there, with Shelby as second-in-command, until July 1775 when Lord Dunmore ordered the fort destroyed, fearing it might become useful to colonial rebels in the growing American Revolution.

==Revolutionary War==
After his unit was disbanded, Shelby surveyed for the Transylvania Company, a land company that purchased much of present-day Kentucky from the Cherokees in a deal later invalidated by the government of Virginia. After fulfilling his duties with the Transylvania Company, he rejoined his family in Virginia, but returned to Kentucky the following year to claim and improve land for himself. After falling ill, he returned home in July 1776 to recover. Back in Virginia, fighting in the American Revolutionary War was underway, and Shelby found a commission from the Virginia Committee of Safety appointing him captain of a company of Minutemen. In 1777, Virginia governor Patrick Henry appointed Shelby to a position securing provisions for the army on the frontier. He served a similar role for units in the Continental Army in 1778 and 1779. With his money, Shelby purchased provisions for John Sevier&#x27;s 1779 expedition against the Chickamauga, a band of Cherokees who were resisting colonial expansion.

Shelby was elected to represent Washington County in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1779. Later that year, he was commissioned a major by Governor Thomas Jefferson and charged with escorting a group of commissioners to establish a frontier boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina. Shortly after his arrival in the region, North Carolina Governor Richard Caswell made him magistrate of newly formed Sullivan County and elevated him to the rank of colonel of the Sullivan County Regiment.

Shelby was surveying lands in Kentucky in 1780 when he heard of the colonists&#x27; defeat at Charleston. He hurried to North Carolina, where he found a request for aid from General Charles McDowell to defend the borders of North Carolina from the British. Shelby assembled three hundred militiamen and joined McDowell at Cherokee Ford in South Carolina. On the morning of July 31, 1780, he surrounded the British stronghold at Thickety Fort on the Pacolet River with 600 men. He immediately demanded a surrender, but the British refused. Shelby brought his men within musket range and again demanded surrender. Though the fort likely would have withstood the attack, the British commander lost his nerve and capitulated. Without firing a shot, Shelby&#x27;s men captured 94 prisoners. 

Following the surrender of Thickety Fort, Shelby joined a band of partisans under Lieutenant Elijah Clarke. This unit was pursued by British Major Patrick Ferguson. On the morning of August 8, 1780, some of Shelby&#x27;s men were gathering peaches from an orchard when they were surprised by some of Ferguson&#x27;s men on a reconnaissance mission. Shelby&#x27;s men quickly readied their arms and drove back the British patrol. Soon, however, the British were reinforced and the colonists fell back. The pattern continued, with one side being reinforced and gaining an advantage, followed by the other. Shelby&#x27;s men were winning the battle when Ferguson&#x27;s main force of 1,000 men arrived. Outmanned, they retreated to a nearby hill where British musket fire could not reach them. Now safe, they taunted the British, and Ferguson&#x27;s force withdrew from the area. Thus ended the Battle of Cedar Springs.

General McDowell then ordered Shelby and Clarke to take Musgrove&#x27;s Mill, a British encampment on the Enoree River. They rode all night with two hundred men, reaching their location about dawn on August 18, 1780. The colonists had estimated the enemy force was of comparable size, but an advance scout brought word there were approximately 500 British soldiers in the camp who were preparing for battle. Shelby&#x27;s men and horses were too tired for a retreat and they had lost the element of surprise. He ordered his men to construct a breastwork from nearby logs and brush. In half an hour the makeshift fortifications were complete, and twenty-five colonial riders charged the British camp to provoke the attack. The British pursued them back to the main colonial force. Despite being outnumbered, the colonists killed several British officers and put their army to flight.

===Battle of Kings Mountain===
Shelby and Clarke elected not to pursue the British fleeing the Battle of Musgrove Mill. Instead, they set their sights on a British fort at Ninety Six, South Carolina, where they were sure they would find Ferguson. However, while en route, Shelby and his men were met with news of General Horatio Gates&#x27; defeat at the Battle of Camden. With the backing of General Cornwallis, Ferguson could ride to meet Shelby with his entire force, so Shelby retreated over the Appalachian Mountains into North Carolina.
Following the colonists&#x27; retreat, an emboldened Ferguson dispatched a paroled prisoner across the mountains to warn the colonists to cease their opposition or Ferguson would lay waste to the countryside. Angered by this act, Shelby and John Sevier began to plan another raid on the British. Shelby and Sevier raised 240 men each, and were joined by William Campbell with 400 from Washington County, Virginia and Charles McDowell with 160 men from Burke and Rutherford counties in North Carolina. The forces mustered at Sycamore Shoals on September 25, 1780. The troops crossed the difficult terrain of the Blue Ridge Mountains and arrived at McDowell&#x27;s estate near Morganton, North Carolina, on September 30, 1780. Here, they were joined by Colonel Benjamin Cleveland and Major Joseph Winston with 350 men from Surry and Wilkes counties.

The combined force pursued Ferguson to Kings Mountain, where he had fortified himself, declaring &quot;God Almighty and all the rebels out of hell&quot; could not move him from it. The Battle of Kings Mountain commenced October 7, 1780. Shelby had ordered his men to advance from tree to tree, firing from behind each one; he called this technique &quot;Indian play&quot; because he had seen the Indians use it in battles with them. Ferguson ordered bayonet charges that forced Shelby&#x27;s men to fall back on three separate occasions, but the colonists dislodged Ferguson&#x27;s men from their position. Seeing the battle was lost, Ferguson and his key officers attempted a retreat. The colonists were instructed to kill Ferguson. Simultaneous shots by Sevier&#x27;s men broke both Ferguson&#x27;s arms, fatally pierced his skull, and knocked him from his mount. Seeing their commander dead, the remaining British soldiers waved white flags of surrender.

Kings Mountain was the high point of Shelby&#x27;s military service, and from that point forward his men dubbed him &quot;Old Kings Mountain&quot;. The North Carolina legislature passed a vote of thanks to Shelby and Sevier for their service and ordered each be presented a pair of pistols and a ceremonial sword. (Shelby did not receive these items until he requested them from the legislature in 1813.)

As the colonists and their prisoners began the march from Kings Mountain, they learned that nine colonial prisoners had been hanged by the British at Fort Ninety-Six. This was not the first such incident in the region, and the enraged colonists vowed they would now put a stop to the hangings in the Carolinas. Summoning a jury from their number¬†‚Äì which was legal because two North Carolina magistrates were present¬†‚Äì the colonists selected random prisoners and charged them with crimes ranging from theft to arson to murder. By evening, the jury had convicted thirty-six prisoners and sentenced them to hang. After the first nine hangings, however, Shelby ordered them stopped. He never gave a reason for this action, but his order was obeyed nonetheless, and the remaining &quot;convicts&quot; rejoined their fellow prisoners.

The Kings Mountain victors and their prisoners returned to McDowell&#x27;s estate, early on, the morning of, October 10, 1780. From there, the various commanders and their men went their separate ways. Shelby and his men joined General Daniel Morgan at New Providence, South Carolina. While there, Shelby advised Morgan to take Fort Ninety-Six and Augusta, because he believed the British forces there were supplying the Cherokee with weapons for their raids against colonial settlers. Morgan agreed to the plan, as did General Horatio Gates, the supreme commander of colonial forces in the region. Assured that his plan would be carried out, Shelby returned home and promised to return the following spring with 300 men. On his way to Fort Ninety-Six, Morgan was attacked by Banastre Tarleton and gained a decisive victory over him at the Battle of Cowpens. Shelby later lamented the fact, that General Nathanael Greene, who relieved Gates only days after Shelby departed for home, claimed the lion&#x27;s share of the credit for Cowpens, when it was Shelby&#x27;s plan that had put Morgan in the position to begin with.

===Later wartime service and settlement in Kentucky===
Upon his return home, Shelby and his father were named commissioners to negotiate a treaty between colonial settlers and the Chickamauga. This service delayed his return to Greene, but in October 1781 he and Sevier led 600 riflemen to join Greene in South Carolina. Greene had thought to use Shelby&#x27;s and Sevier&#x27;s men to prevent Cornwallis from returning to Charleston. However, Cornwallis was defeated at the siege of Yorktown, shortly after Shelby and Sevier arrived, and Greene sent them on to join General Francis Marion on the Pee Dee River. On Marion&#x27;s orders, Shelby and Colonel Hezekiah Maham captured a British fort at Fair Lawn near Moncks Corner on November 27, 1781.

While still in the field, Shelby was elected to the House of Commons of the North Carolina General Assembly. He requested and was granted a leave of absence from the Army to attend the legislative session of December 1781. He was re-elected in 1782 and attended the April session of the legislature that year. In early 1783, he was chosen as a commissioner to survey preemption claims of soldiers along the Cumberland River.

Shelby returned to Kentucky in April 1783, settling at Boonesborough. He married Susannah Hart on April 19, 1783; the couple had eleven children. Their eldest daughter, Sarah, married Dr. Ephraim McDowell, and the youngest daughter, Letitia, married future Kentucky secretary of state Charles Stewart Todd. On November 1, 1783, the family moved to Lincoln County, near Knob Lick, and occupied land awarded to Shelby for his military service. Shelby was named one of the first trustees of Transylvania Seminary (later Transylvania University) in 1783, and on December 1, 1787, founded the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge.

Shelby began working to secure Kentucky&#x27;s separation from Virginia as early as 1784. That year, he attended a convention to consider leading an expedition against the Indians and separating Kentucky from Virginia. He was a delegate to subsequent conventions in 1787, 1788, and 1789 that worked toward a constitution for Kentucky. During these conventions he helped thwart James Wilkinson&#x27;s scheme to align Kentucky with the Spanish. In 1791 Shelby, Charles Scott and Benjamin Logan were among those chosen by the Virginia legislature to serve on the Board of War for the district of Kentucky. Shelby was also made High Sheriff on Lincoln County. In 1792, he was a delegate to the final convention that framed the first Kentucky Constitution.

==First term as governor==
Under the new constitution, the voters chose electors who then elected the governor and members of the Kentucky Senate. Though there is no indication that Shelby actively sought the office of governor, he was elected unanimously to that post by the electors on May 17, 1791. He took office on June 4, 1792, the day the state was admitted to the Union. Though not actively partisan, he identified with the Democratic-Republicans. Much of his term was devoted to establishing basic laws, military divisions and a tax structure.

One of Shelby&#x27;s chief concerns was securing federal aid to defend the frontier. Although Kentuckians were engaged in an undeclared war with American Indians north of the Ohio River, Shelby had been ordered by Secretary of War Henry Knox not to conduct offensive military actions against the Indians. Furthermore, he was limited by federal regulations that restricted the service of state militiamen to thirty days, which was too short to be effective. With the meager resources of his fledgling state he was only able to defend the most vulnerable areas from Indian attack. Meanwhile, Kentuckians suspected that the Indians were being stirred up and supplied by the British.

Shelby appealed to President Washington for help; Washington responded by appointing General &quot;Mad&quot; Anthony Wayne to the area with orders to push the Indians out of the Northwest Territory. Wayne arrived at Fort Washington (present-day Cincinnati, Ohio) in May 1793, but was prevented from taking any immediate action because federal commissioners were still attempting to negotiate a treaty with the Indians. He called for 1,000 volunteer troops from Kentucky, but few heeded the call and Shelby resorted to conscription. By the time the soldiers arrived, winter had set in. He ordered the men to go home and return in the spring.

After a winter filled with Indian attacks, including one which claimed the life of Shelby&#x27;s younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne&#x27;s call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby did not agree with some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.

Another major concern of the Shelby administration was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state&#x27;s economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This would have been the natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.

===Citizen Gen√™t affair===
While Kentuckians despised the British and Spanish, they had a strong affinity for the French. They admired the republican government that had arisen from the French Revolution, and they had not forgotten France&#x27;s aid during the Revolutionary War. When French Ambassador Edmond-Charles Gen√™t, popularly known as Citizen Gen√™t, arrived in the United States in April 1793, George Rogers Clark was already considering an expedition to capture Spanish lands in the west. Gen√™t&#x27;s agent, Andr√© Michaux, was dispatched to Kentucky to assess the support of Kentuckians toward Clark&#x27;s expedition. When he gained an audience with Governor Shelby, he did so with letters of introduction from Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Kentucky Senator John Brown.
Jefferson had written a separate letter to Shelby warning him against aiding the French schemes and informing him that negotiations were under way with the Spanish regarding trade on the Mississippi. When the letter was sent on August 29, 1793, it was Jefferson&#x27;s intent that it reach Shelby before Michaux did, but Shelby did not receive it until October 1793. On September 13, 1793, Michaux met with Shelby, but there is no evidence that Shelby agreed to help him. In his response to Jefferson&#x27;s delayed letter, Shelby assured Jefferson that Kentuckians &quot;possess too just a sense of the obligation they owe the General Government, to embark in any enterprise that would be so injurious to the United States&quot;.

In November 1793, Shelby received a letter from another of Gen√™t&#x27;s agents, Charles Delpeau. He confided to Shelby that he had been sent to secure supplies for an expedition against Spanish holdings, and inquired whether Shelby had been instructed to arrest individuals associated with such a scheme. Three days later Shelby responded by letter, relating Jefferson&#x27;s warning against aiding the French. Despite having no evidence that Shelby was party to Gen√™t&#x27;s scheme, both Jefferson and Knox felt compelled to warn him a second time. Jefferson provided names and descriptions of the French agents believed to be in Kentucky and encouraged their arrest. Knox went a step further by suggesting Kentucky would be reimbursed for any costs incurred resisting the French by force, should such action become necessary. General Anthony Wayne informed him that his cavalry was at the state&#x27;s disposal. Arthur St. Clair, governor of the American Northwest Territory, also admonished Shelby against cooperation with Gen√™t.

In his response to Jefferson, Shelby questioned whether he had the legal authority to intervene with force against his constituency and expressed his personal aversion to doing so.

Shelby tempered this lukewarm commitment by assuring Jefferson that &quot;I shall, at all times, hold it my duty to perform whatever may be constitutionally required of me, as Governor of Kentucky, by the President of the United States.&quot;

In March 1794, perhaps in response to Shelby&#x27;s concerns, Congress passed a measure granting the government additional powers in the event of an invasion or insurrection. Jefferson&#x27;s successor Edmund Randolph, who actually received Shelby&#x27;s letter, wrote Shelby to inform him of the new powers at his disposal, and informing him that the new regime in France had recalled Gen√™t. Two months later Gen√™t&#x27;s agents ceased their operations in Kentucky and the potential crisis was averted. In 1795, President Washington negotiated an agreement with the Spanish that secured the right of Americans to trade on the river.
Having successfully dealt with the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Shelby retired to Traveler&#x27;s Rest, his Lincoln County estate, at the conclusion of his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.

==Second term as governor==
Gabriel Slaughter was the favorite choice for governor of Kentucky in 1812. Only one impediment to his potential candidacy existed. Growing tensions between the United States, France, and Great Britain threatened to break into open war. With this prospect looming, Isaac Shelby&#x27;s name began circulating as a possible candidate for governor. Slaughter, who lived near Shelby, visited him and asked whether he would run. Shelby assured him that he had no desire to do so unless a national emergency that required his leadership emerged. Satisfied with this answer, Slaughter began his campaign.

The situation with the European powers grew worse, and on June 18, 1812 the United States declared war on Great Britain, beginning the War of 1812. Cries grew louder for Shelby to return as Kentucky&#x27;s chief executive. On July 18, 1812, less than a month before the election, Shelby acquiesced and announced his candidacy.

During the campaign Shelby&#x27;s political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized his response to Jefferson&#x27;s second letter regarding the Gen√™t affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government&#x27;s attention to the situation in the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have known at the time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.

Slaughter&#x27;s supporters mocked Shelby&#x27;s advanced age (he was almost 62), calling him &quot;Old Daddy Shelby&quot;. One Kentucky paper even printed an anonymous charge that Shelby had run from the Battle of Kings Mountain. Though few even among Shelby&#x27;s enemies believed the story, his supporters and Shelby himself responded through missives in the state&#x27;s newspapers. One supporter typified these responses, writing &quot;It is reported that Colonel Shelby &#x27;run [sic] at Kings Mountain.&#x27; True he did. He first run [sic] up to the enemy ... then after an action of about forty-seven minutes, he run [sic] again with 900 prisoners.&quot;

As the canvass stretched into August, Shelby grew more confident of victory and began preparations to return to the state house. He predicted a victory of 10,000 votes; the final margin was more than 17,000. When he took the oath of office, Shelby became the first Kentucky governor to serve non-consecutive terms. (James Garrard had been permitted to serve consecutive terms in 1796 and 1800 by special legislative exemption.)

Preparations for the war dominated Shelby&#x27;s second term. Two days before his inauguration, he and outgoing governor Charles Scott met at the state house to appoint William Henry Harrison commander of the Kentucky militia. This was done in violation of a constitutional mandate that the post be held by a native Kentuckian. Already commander of the militias of Indiana and Illinois, Harrison picked up Kentucky volunteers at Newport before hurrying to the defense of Fort Wayne.

Shelby pressured President James Madison to give Harrison command of all military forces in the Northwest. Madison acceded, rescinding his earlier appointment of James Winchester. On the state level, Shelby revised militia laws to make every male between the ages of 18 and 45 eligible for military service; ministers were excluded from the provision. Seven thousand volunteers enlisted, and many more had to be turned away. Shelby encouraged the state&#x27;s women to sew and knit items for Kentucky&#x27;s troops.

Shelby&#x27;s confidence in the federal government&#x27;s war planning was shaken by the disastrous Battle of Frenchtown in which a number of Kentucky soldiers died. He vowed to personally act to aid the war effort should the opportunity arise, and was authorized by the legislature to do so. In March 1813, Harrison requested another 1,200 Kentuckians to join him at Fort Meigs. Shelby dispatched the requested number, among whom was his oldest son James, under General Green Clay. The reinforcements arrived to find Fort Meigs under siege by a combined force of British and Indians. Clay&#x27;s force was able to stop the siege, but a large number of them were captured and massacred by Indians. Initial reports put James Shelby among the dead, but he was later discovered to have been captured and released in a prisoner exchange.

On July 30, 1813, General Harrison again wrote Shelby requesting volunteers, and this time he asked that Shelby lead them personally. Shelby raised a force of 3,500 volunteers, double the number Harrison requested. Future governor John J. Crittenden served as Shelby&#x27;s aide-de-camp. Now a Major General, Shelby led the volunteers to join Harrison in a campaign that culminated in the American victory at the Battle of the Thames.

In Harrison&#x27;s report of the battle to Secretary of War John Armstrong Jr., he said of Shelby, &quot;I am at a loss to how to mention [the service] of Governor Shelby, being convinced that no eulogism of mine can reach his merit.&quot; In 1817, Shelby received the thanks of Congress and was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for his service in the war. Friends of Shelby suggested he run for Vice President, but Shelby quickly and emphatically declined.

==Later life==
Upon Shelby&#x27;s leaving office in 1816, President Monroe offered him the post of Secretary of War, but he declined because of his age. Already a founding member of the Kentucky Bible Society, Shelby consented to serve as vice-president of the New American Bible Society in 1816. He was a faithful member of Danville Presbyterian church, but in 1816, built a small nondenominational church on his property. In 1818, he accompanied Andrew Jackson in negotiating the Jackson Purchase with the Chickasaw. He also served as the first president of the Kentucky Agricultural Society in 1818 and was chairman of the first board of trustees of Centre College in 1819.

==Death==

In 1820, Isaac Shelby was stricken with paralysis in his right arm and leg. He died of a stroke on July 18, 1826, at his home in Lincoln County. Shelby was a slaveowner, and left slaves to his children in his will. He was buried on the grounds of his estate, Traveller&#x27;s Rest. The state erected a monument over his grave in 1827. In 1952, the Shelby family cemetery was given to the state government and became the Isaac Shelby Cemetery State Historic Site.

==Legacy==
Shelby&#x27;s patriotism is believed to have inspired the Kentucky state motto: &quot;United we stand, divided we fall&quot;. He was fond of &quot;The Liberty Song&quot;, a 1768 composition by John Dickinson, which contains the line &quot;They join in hand, brave Americans all, By uniting we stand, by dividing we fall.&quot; Though he is sometimes credited with designing the state seal, his public papers show that the design was suggested by James Wilkinson.

Centre College began awarding the Isaac Shelby Medallion in 1972, and since then, it has become the college&#x27;s most prestigious honor. Those awarded the Medallion exemplify the ideals of service to Centre and dedication to the public good that were embraced by Shelby during his time at Centre and in Kentucky.

After Kyrgyzstan gained independence on August 31, 1991, the national team was created. Kyrgyzstan played its first match on August 23, 1992, in the against Uzbekistan in Tashkent. The match ended in a 3-0 victory for Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan eventually finished in fourth place. The team was scheduled to play against Turkmenistan on July 16, 1992, but the match was cancelled due to the absence of the Turkmenistan team. In 1993, Kyrgyzstan participated in the 1993 ECO Cup in Iran, but failed to advance past the group stage.

In 1994, the Football Federation of Kyrgyzstan was admitted as a full member of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) and FIFA. The team participated in the Uzbekistan Independence Cup, finishing in last place. The team did not play any matches in 1995, and in 1996, they participated in the 1996 AFC Asian Cup qualification, finishing in second place in their group and failing to advance.

<text>Wightlink is a ferry company operating routes across The Solent between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight in the south of England. It operates car ferries between Lymington and Yarmouth, and Portsmouth and Fishbourne and a fast passenger-only catamaran between Portsmouth Harbour and Ryde Pier. It is jointly owned by Basalt Infrastructure Partners and Fiera Infrastructure.
==History==

Wightlink and its forerunners have provided ferry services to and from the Isle of Wight for more than 160 years. In the early 19th century, ferries ran to the island from Lymington and Portsmouth. Later, steam ferries operated a circular route around Lymington, Yarmouth, Cowes, Ryde and Portsmouth. When the railway companies became involved, they concentrated on two direct routes, Lymington to Yarmouth and Portsmouth to Ryde. Operation of the ferries was eventually moved under a separate subsidiary of the British Railways Board called Sealink.

In 1984 Sealink was sold to Sea Containers. When Stena Line bought Sealink in 1990, the Isle of Wight ferries remained with Sea Containers, as Wightlink. In June 1995 Wightlink was the subject of a management buyout. In 2005 it was bought by the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund.

In 2005, a Wightlink car ferry featured briefly in the film &quot;Fragile&quot; starring Calista Flockhart. The ferry is shown very briefly in a wide-angle shot. Closer shots used Red Funnel&#x27;s .

In October 2006 Wightlink announced its intention to build two new ferries for the Yarmouth to Lymington route. These ships are slightly bigger than their predecessors, with extra vehicle space, but only accommodate 360 passengers compared to 500 on the older vessels. Wightlink later announced that a third new ferry would enter service in spring 2009. A dispute with some Lymington residents led to delay and threatened the viability of the route. In November 2008, the service was reduced so only two ships were required, allowing for the delay in the introduction of the new vessels. Sea trials were not complete by November 2008 and introduction became pressing with the expiry of safety certificates on the previous fleet. Wightlink proposed interim arrangements enabling them restricted use of the new ferries until the trials could be completed in full.
In March 2008 Wightlink revealed that an order had been placed with FBMA Marine to construct two new passenger catamarans for the Portsmouth to Ryde service, to replace the three craft currently employed. They entered service in 2009.

From May 2008 Wightlink introduced a fuel surcharge on all crossings, linked to the price of Brent Crude oil. However, in November 2008 the surcharge dropped to zero following the sharp reduction in crude prices during the credit crunch and as of November 2009 was still at zero.

Wightlink planned to spend ¬£17.5 million on improving its Portsmouth to Fishbourne route. This involved remodelling the terminal facilities at both Fishbourne and Portsmouth. The flagship was to have its upper car deck adjusted so vehicles access it directly from on-shore ramps. Two of the older ferries were to be stretched in length by 12 metres, with upper car decks similar to &quot;St Clare&quot;&#x27;s being added, replacing movable mezzanine decks. Of the remaining two ferries, has been sold and was used mainly for freight until she too was sold. As part of this investment project the reservations and ticketing system was replaced by CarRes from Carus.

On 16 February 2015, Wightlink was sold by the Macquarie European Infrastructure Fund to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure Partners (BBIP). On 15 May 2015, Wightlink announced a revised investment of ¬£45 million to include the purchase a new ferry, upgrading &quot;St Clare&quot; and modifications to the terminals at both ends to facilitate double-deck loading.

In July 2016, Balfour Beatty exited BBIP, which became Basalt Infrastructure Partners.

In August 2017, Wightlink announced that a new vehicle ferry, , would be built for the Portsmouth to Fishbourne service. It entered service on 26 August 2018. In May 2019, BBIP sold a 50% stake in the business to Fiera Infrastructure of Canada.

===Vehicle ferries===



The introduction of the Wight class ferries was a much-discussed affair, with some Lymington residents claiming that the increased size of the ferries posed a risk, both in environmental terms and to users of pleasure craft on the Lymington river.

<doc id="1092735" wikidata="Q1673455" url="?curid=1092735" title="Isaac Van Wart">
<text>Isaac Van Wart (October 25, 1762May 23, 1828) was a militiaman from the state of New York during the American Revolution. In 1780, he was one of three men who captured British Major John Andr√©, who was convicted and executed as a spy for conspiring with treasonous Continental general and commandant of West Point Benedict Arnold.

== American Revolution ==
A yeoman farmer, Van Wart joined the volunteer militia when New York was a battle zone of the American Revolution. Overnight on 22‚Äì23 September 1780, he joined John Paulding and David Williams in an armed patrol of the area. The three men seized a traveling British officer, Major John Andr√©, in Tarrytown, New York, at a site now called Patriot&#x27;s Park. Holding him in custody, they discovered documents of Andr√©&#x27;s secret communication with Benedict Arnold. The militiamen, all yeomen farmers, refused Andr√©&#x27;s considerable bribe and delivered him to Continental Army headquarters. Arnold&#x27;s plans to surrender West Point to the British were revealed and foiled, and Andr√© was hanged as a spy.

With George Washington&#x27;s personal recommendation, the United States Congress awarded Van Wart, Paulding and Williams the first military decoration of the United States, the silver medal known as the Fidelity Medallion. Each of the three also received federal pensions of $200 a year, and prestigious farms awarded by New York State.

== Personal life==
Van Wart was born in the farm country of Greenburgh, New York, near the village of Elmsford. He lived on the frontier and his birthdate is not recorded.

Van Wart married Rachel Storm (1760‚Äì1834), a daughter of Elmsford&#x27;s most prominent family (from whom the settlement&#x27;s original name, &quot;Storm&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, was derived). He divided his time between his family, his farm, and his church (he became an elder deacon of the Dutch Reformed Church). Van Wart was buried in the cemetery of the Elmsford Reformed Church in Elmsford, New York. His tombstone said that he died at the age of sixty-nine.

== Legacy ==
Van Wart died in Elmsford on 23 May 1828 and is buried in the cemetery of the Old Dutch Reformed Church on Route 9. A marble and granite monument was erected at his grave on 11 June 1829, bears the single emphatic word &quot;FIDELITY&quot;, followed by this epitaph, 
The three militiamen were highly celebrated in their lifetimes: commemorations large and small abound in Westchester, and can be found in many disparate parts of the early United States. Among other honors, each of the men had his name given to a county in the new state of Ohio (1803), each along its western border: Van Wert County bears a common alternate spelling of the name. Adjacent Paulding County is located north of Van Wert County. Williams County is in the northwest corner of the state, separated from Paulding County by Defiance County.

Still, Van Wart and the others did see their reputations impugned by some. Andr√© at his trial had insisted the men were mere brigands; sympathy for him remained in some more aristocratic American quarters (and grew to legend in England, where he was buried in Westminster Abbey). Giving voice to this sympathy, Representative Benjamin Tallmadge of Connecticut persuaded Congress to deny the men a requested pension increase in 1817, publicly assailing their credibility and motivations. Despite the slight, the men&#x27;s popular acclaim continued to grow throughout the 19th century to almost mythic status. Some modern scholars have interpreted the episode as a major event in early American cultural development, representing the apotheosis of the common man in the new democratic society.

Van Wart and his companions are honored on the monument erected at the site of the capture in Tarrytown, dedicated on June 11, 1829, by the Revolutionary general and congressman Aaron Ward of nearby Ossining. A Van Wart Avenue is located on the south side of Tarrytown, near the Tappan Zee Bridge. Three streets in the neighboring village of Elmsford, New York, are named for the militiamen, with Van Wart Street being one of the village&#x27;s main roads. White Plains, New York, has a Van Wart Avenue in the southwest section of the city, off NY Route 22.

<text>The Chennakesava Temple, also referred to as Chennakeshava Temple and Keshava Temple, is a Vaishnava Hindu temple on the banks of River Kaveri at Somanathapura, Mysuru, Karnataka, India.The temple was consecrated in 1258 CE by Somanatha Dandanayaka, a general of the Hoysala King Narasimha III. It is located east of Mysuru city.

The ornate temple is a model illustration of the Hoysala architecture. The temple is enclosed in a courtyard with a pillared corridor of small shrines (damaged). The main temple in the center is on a high star-shaped platform with three symmetrical sanctums (&quot;garbha-griha&quot;), set in a square matrix (89&#x27; x 89&#x27;) oriented along the east‚Äìwest and north‚Äìsouth axes. The western sanctum was for a statue of Kesava (missing), the northern sanctum of Janardhana and the southern sanctum of Venugopala, all forms of Vishnu. The sanctums share a common community hall (&quot;sabha-mandapa&quot;) with many pillars. The outer walls, the inner walls, the pillars and the ceiling of the temple are intricately carved with theological iconography of Hinduism and display extensive friezes of Hindu texts such as the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (southern section), the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (northern section) and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (western section of the main temple).

The Chennakesava temple, states author George Michell, represents the climax of the development in Hoysala temple style and yet is also unique in many ways.

In 2023, the Somanathapura temple, along with the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu and the Chennakeshava Temple at Belur, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as part of the Sacred Ensembles of the Hoysalas.

==History==
The Somanathapura town was founded in the 13th century by a general named Somanatha (Someya Dandanayaka in some inscriptions). He was working for the Hoysala King Narasimha III. Somanatha created an Agrahara, that is granted land to Brahmins and dedicated resources to build and maintain temples therein. The town (&quot;pura&quot;) became known after the name of the patron, Somanatha-pura. The location is also referred by alternate spellings, such as Somnathpur.

In the middle of the new settlement, Somanatha built the Kesava temple and consecrated it in 1258 CE. This was a Vaishnavism tradition temple. In addition to this temple, Somanatha consecrated a Shaivism tradition related Panchalinga temple (literally, &quot;five linga temple&quot;) in the east-northeast corner of the land grant. He also built a fort wall around the land, but these are now in ruins. According to the inscriptions and textual evidence, Somanatha additionally built the Purahara, Narasimhesvara, Murahara, Lakshminarasimha and Yoganarayana temples in Hoysala style in the region, but all these temples except the Lakshminarasimha have disappeared, after wars between the Hindu kingdoms and Muslim Sultanates ravaged the region. The Lakshminarasimha temple is also in ruins. From the other disappeared temples, the sanctum image of Yoganarayana temple is only known surviving artwork, but it too is in a damaged form.

The Kesava temple too was badly damaged, according to 15th-century inscriptions. It was repaired in the 16th century with financial support and grants by the emperors of the Vijayanagara Empire. The repairs are evidenced by the different color of stones and quality of work in the veranda and parts of the northern tower and platform of the main temple. The repaired temple was damaged in the 19th century, then repaired again in the early 20th century by the colonial era Mysore government.
The Kesava temple is one of some 1,500 Hindu and Jain temples built by the Hoysala Empire kings in different parts of their kingdom. The other well studied Hoysala temples include those at Belur and Halebidu.

The temple was destroyed during Muslim attacks in the Hoysala kingdoms. The first attack was by Malik Kafur, Alauddin Khilji&#x27;s general in 1311 and in 1326 Muhammad Bin Tughlaq destroyed the remaining structures. Some parts of the temples were restored by Vijayanagara Kings and later by Wodeyars of Mysuru.

===Inscriptions===
A few of the significant historical dates and circumstances around the Kesava temple is inscribed in eight stones in different parts of South India. Four of the inscriptions are found on soapstone slabs at the entrance of the temple. Two inscriptions are found in the ceilings of the veranda that surrounds the temple, one near the southeast corner and the other about the northwest corner. Another inscription is found near Harihareshwara Temple on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. The eighth inscription is found in the Shiva temple at the periphery of the original land grant, the Panchalinga temple. Most of these inscriptions confirm that the temple was operational about mid 13th century. Two inscriptions, one dated 1497 CE and another to 1550 CE describe the damage and the repairs done to this temple.

The temple has numerous small inscriptions which are either logo of the mason guilds or the name of the artist who carved the block, pillar or artwork.

==Description==
Keshava, Janardhana and Venugopala are names found in the &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, all in the context of Krishna. The term &quot;Chennake≈õava&quot; means &quot;handsome Keshava&quot;. The Keshava temple at the Somanathapura is a temple of the Vaishnavism tradition within Hinduism, and one of many Keshava temples built in or before the 13th century in different parts of India, as well as in Belur in 1117 CE about away.
The Keshava temple at Somanathapura faces east and is enclosed in a walled courtyard with a major gate (&quot;mahadvara&quot;). Outside the walls before the gate stands a tall pillar, which once had a Garuda statue on top, now missing. Inside the gate, to the left are vertical standing inscription stones. These stones have the form of the hero stones, with the top decorated with Hindu iconography as well as miniature reliefs of Keshava, Janardhana and Venugopala. The inscription is in old Kannada. The small entrance mandapa is supported by lathe-carved soapstone pillars. The temple is carved from soapstone, a green-grey chloritic schist material that is soft in quarry but hardens when exposed to air. This is not locally available and must have been imported from another part of South India. It enabled the artists to shape and carve out intricate details for the artwork.

The temple has a large open public courtyard surrounded by the walled enclosure, with the main three-towered temple in the center. The courtyard wall frames a rectangular veranda and an array of small shrines.

===Architecture===

The northern and southern row of small shrines inside the pillared courtyard corridor consists of eighteen single shrine and one linked-double shrine each. The linked-double shrine is at the northwestern and southwestern corners of the courtyard. The western row consists of fourteen small shrines, while the eastern row consists of eight single small shrines and two linked-double shrines. In total, the Kesava temple consists of 58 small 1x1 small shrines, 4 small 2x1 linked-double shrines, 2 near entrance, and the main central temple. The 64 corridor shrines once featured Vedic and Puranic deities and rooms for pilgrims. The statues in the smaller shrines were defaced, their limbs broken or destroyed. Some of the recovered broken pieces are in a heap inside the temple. The collection includes Jaina statues in the Kayotsarga posture as well as numerous Hindu statues. The ceiling of the southern array of shrines has carvings on its ceiling, the western does not and it have a repair-related inscription instead from Vijayanagara Empire era. The northern array also mostly lacks any ceiling art work except near the stairs in the middle, while the eastern array shows the greatest signs of damage and restoration with most small shrines missing but for signs of their foundation.

The main temple is built on a &quot;jagati&quot;, which symbolizes worldly platform. It is about 3 feet high, star-shaped and has stone steps at its east end for the visitor to climb up to it. Near the stairs, on each side are two &quot;dvarapala&quot; (guardian) shrines but these are damaged.
The raised &quot;jagati&quot; platform circles around the main temple with a broad walking space. It is the &quot;pradakshina patha&quot; (circumambulation path), and is supposed to be walked in a clockwise manner in order to pictorially read the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; legends in the correct sequence. The eastern side of the platform is rectangular, while the space below the &quot;vimana&quot; (temple tower) mirrors the pointed star tower shape, with nine points on each side and two linking edges (a total of 29). A stone elephant originally stood at each star point end of the platform, but only 11 of the 15 original have survived in a damaged condition. On the sides of the star side and where two stars of the &quot;jagati&quot; platform meet were 14 mid size images likely of &quot;Nagas&quot; and 58 images of &quot;Yakshas&quot; but all of this are now missing. The temple premises stores 7 of the broken pieces found in the early 20th century.

The platform appears from distance to be five stacks from the careful moulding. From the &quot;jagati&quot; level, there are four stone steps that leads the devotee into the temple&#x27;s &quot;sabha mandapa&quot; inside. The hall appears to be rectangular, yet consists of two fused squares and a rectangle. A small square is at the entrance, the largest square in the middle, and a rectangle facing the three sanctum (&quot;garbha griya&quot;), all supported by intricately carved pillars. The main hall opens to each sanctum through a small square shaped puja mandapa. The three sanctums house Keshava (image lost), Janardhana and Venugopala. Above each of these sanctums rise the 16 pointed star shaped North Indian style tower (shikara).

===Outer walls: lower levels===

The outer wall of the main temple consists of parallel horizontal bands of artwork carved above the circumambulatory platform. It has three major section, the basement band, the wall band and the top band. The lowest band in the basement section is about 6 inches tall and shows a row of elephants mostly marching to the left in the clockwise direction the devotee is expected to walk. The elephants are not exact copy of each other, rather show different natural expressions and playfulness of elephants. Some show elephants in war, throwing enemies; while others show them teasing the riders in front. The band above the elephants is of horses with armed riders, depicting a military march. In some spots, camels substitute for horses suggesting that the Hoysala had adopted camels into their army. Some spots also show battle scene with horses. In various places, the artists added humor by placing dwarfs and monkeys supporting the front raised leg of the horses.

The band above the horsemen friezes is a scroll of nature. It shows flowers, fruits, occasionally some peacocks and wildlife. The band above it is the mythology frieze. It is about 7 inches tall, around 2.5 feet above the platform, and it depicts the legends and spiritual stories found in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; (up to face 5), the Puranas particularly the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; (from face 6 to 11) and lastly the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. There are numerous panels around the temple that tell the various Hindu fables and stories.

====Ramayana====

Only the early &quot;parvas&quot; of the Ramayana are depicted. A few shown at the Kesava temple include:
*Dasharatha makes ritual offerings and prayers for children. Rama and his brothers are born.
*Babies rocked in cradles, another frieze shows Rama and his brothers crawling on all fours.
*School life, martial lessons.
*Young Rama slays Tataka to protect the Rishis.
*Vishvamitra, Rama and Lakshmana at Janaka&#x27;s court. Another shows Sita marrying him.
*Married Rama and his brothers in Ayodhya.
*Rama, Lakshmana and Sita leave for their exile. They wander in forests and meet various sages.
*Viradha attacks Sita, Rama slays him.
*Surpanakhi episode.
*Golden deer legend.
*Ravana abducts Sita. Another frieze shows him slaying Jatayu.
*Hanuman and Sugriva meet and join Rama.

The rest of the Ramayana is not depicted, and the Bhagavata Purana starts thereafter.

====Bhagavata Purana====
The band around the western shrine depicts the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;. Some scenes of the Bhagavata are repeated. A few of the legends from it shown at the Kesava temple include:
*Reclining Vishnu in the cosmic ocean story.
*Vasudeva&#x27;s marriage legend.
*Baby Krishna being carried across the river by Vasudeva.
*Various friezes of baby Krishna feeding in Gokula, rocked in cradle, crawling on all fours.
*Krishna kills Putana and Sakatasura.
*Toddler Krishna steals butter.
*Krishan lifts Govardhana.
*Various friezes of Krishna playing with enchanted gopis.
*Krishna kills various demons and ultimately slays Kamsa.

====Mahabharata====

A few of the scenes shown on the outer wall of the temple include:
*Dhritarashtra&#x27;s court.
*The rivalry between Pandava and Kauravas as they are growing up.
*Pandavas leaving for forest.
*Bhima marries Hidimbi, birth of Ghatotkacha.
*Pandavas meet Drupada and stay at a potter&#x27;s house.
*Draupadi&#x27;s marriage partner selection ceremony.
*Arjuna hits the fish target, Draupadi picks him as her husband.
*Pandavas return with Draupadi.
*Yudhisthira plays dice, loses.
*War scenes. Krishna advises the Pandavas.
*A scene where a hero does Yoga seated in an &quot;asana&quot;, while admirers garland him.
*Pandavas win. Their return to kingdom.

===Outer walls: upper levels===
====Mantapa walls====
Above the lower level band with friezes depicting the Hindu fables and legends is a band of mythical &quot;makaras&quot; (a creature based on the fusion of various animals) and then a band of decorative peacocks. Above the peacock band of nearly 200 relief carvings are rows of secular life of the people and small size deity reliefs that wraps around only the &quot;sabha mantapa&quot; (community hall) part of the main temple. Most of these are defaced and damaged. Some are difficult to identify.

The deity-related reliefs are predominantly Vishnu shown in his various aspects and avatars in the Vaishnavism tradition, but they include Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, Devis of the Shaktism tradition and Surya of the Saura tradition of Hinduism. For example, of the panels when counted clockwise from entrance, #12 is of Saura, #23 is of Durga in her Mahishasuramardini form, #25 to #28 are of Shaiva tradition.
The reliefs showing common life of the people include festive scenes, dancers in various mudras, musicians with 13th century musical instruments, couples in courtship and sexual scenes, mothers nurturing babies, hunters and other professionals with pets such as dogs, soldiers, yogi, rishi, individuals in namaste posture, couples praying and others. These reliefs also include numerous friezes showing the story of Prahlada, Hiranyakashipu and Vishnu avatar Narasimha.

====Garbha griha tower walls====
In the case of the three towers, above the peacock band of carvings is a row of larger size deity reliefs that wraps around the temple. There are about 90 reliefs showing mostly Vishnu with Lakshmi, as well as Shakti, Shiva, Brahma, Saraswati, Indra, Indrani, Kama, Rati, and others. Most of these are also partially defaced such as broken noses, chopped limbs, chopped out stone jewelry and show other forms of damage. Some are therefore difficult to identify.

Some illustrative carvings of large images include:
*Tandava Ganesha
*Dancing Saraswati
*Keshava, Venugopala, Janardana, Krishna legends
*Vishnu to be same as Indra, Varuna, Yama, Vasudeva, Yoganarayana, Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna and Buddha
*Dancing Lakshmi in various forms
*Brahma with and without beard
*Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu) in various forms
*Surya
*Durga as Mahishasuramardini
*Dancing Vishnu

The first sixty and the last sixty reliefs have a superior finish and details, while the middle sixty five (#61 to #134) panels are less detailed. Some of the panels are signed below by the artist.

====Toranas and higher levels====
The large wall images on the three identical tower superstructures each has an arch (&quot;torana&quot;) to frame the image. The western side has simple flat or geometric arches, while the northern and southern sides have intricately carved nature themes, such as hanging fruits, flowers and flower laden creepers. Some include buds and stages of natural development in flowering plants, while a few include wildlife such as a lion in the center. The tower itself combines intricate artwork, in a plan that alternates rotating squares with star-shaped 16 petalled lotuses. As the tower rises, interim shikaras are capped with kalashas (pots common in Hindu ceremonies).

All three towers are of same height. Their plan uses lotus with an oblong projection, four sets of ornamental turrets, rhythmically reducing in height and are capped by a stone &quot;kalasa&quot;. The carvings on the tower include dancers, gandharvas, yakshas, kirtimukhas, lion faces and mythical animals such as makaras. The top of each tower is shaped as an inverted blooming lotus flower. The original tower tops each had a large stone kalasa, but these were damaged along with the &quot;sukanasa&quot;, and the temple was without them. A recent restoration replaced the missing large kalasa with a small cement kalasa.

===Mantapa, Navaranga===

The main temple is entered from its east doorway. It lacked a door, but the ASI which manages the temple has added a wooden door to the temple. Inside the door is the Navaranga with the usual nine squares suggested by ancient Hindu texts on temple design. The square format is stretched by providing three &quot;ankanas&quot; and &quot;jagali&quot; platforms for the visiting devotees to sit. The architects brought in light by integrating a perforated screens on the wall. According to Krishna, the layout of three doorways inside and two niches whose images are now missing suggests that the interior of this temple was designed per Panchayatana puja architecture found in Smarta Hindu tradition.

===Pillars and ceilings===

The &quot;mandapa&quot; (hall) is supported by lathe turned pillars. The pillars, except two of them, are of the same size. All of them, except four in center, have five mouldings from common life themes stacked in sequence: disc, bell, pot, wheel and umbrella. The four set of central square pillars of the Navaranga have yakshas and brackets, which have been damaged or have disappeared. The two pillars to the east of the central square are shaped as a 32 pointed-star.

The Navaranga roof consists of 16 squares, nine in the &quot;sabha mandapa&quot; and the remaining seven in the extension near the eastern entrance. These are all carved, each different, each with nature motifs and Hindu theology symbolism embedded. Among them is a palm leaves theme, different stages of lotus opening, endless knot symbolizing karma and samsara, one with &#x27;dancers, musicians, soldiers with standing Vishnu and Shiva in various forms&#x27;, rafters in Sri Chakra tantric layout and others.

Between pillars, the ceiling is domical and intricately decorated. These decorations could include multi-petalled lotuses, banana bud motifs based on stepped ponds and snake like (&quot;ananta&quot;) knots (symbolising eternity). Inside the temple, each &quot;vimana&quot; has a vestibule that connects it to the main rectangular &quot;mantapa&quot; (hall).

===Interior wall carvings===

The Navaranga has friezes showing scenes from the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

===Sanctums===

Of the three shrines, one shrine is dedicated to Keshava, but the image is missing from the sanctum. The other two shrines house images of Janardhana and Krishna as Venugopala (all three images are forms of the Hindu god Vishnu).

====South shrine====
The south shrine entrance has two dvarapalas: Bhadra and Subhadra. The lintel above the entrance shows Venugopala. A 13th century Lakshminarayana carving is shown seated in the Sukhasana yoga pose, with him are chakra, conch, lotus and a gada (mace). Past the Sukhanasi, are Jaya and Vijaya, while the lintel shows a seated Vishnu and the canopy shows a dancing Vishnu. The south &quot;garbha griya&quot; is 8&#x27;x8&#x27; feet square, but includes niches into the wall for more space. The image of Krishna in the sanctum is 4.5 feet high. He wears ear rings, necklaces, armlets, bracelets, finger rings, toe rings, anklets, girdle and jewelled diadem. His legs are crossed, head slightly bent as he plays the bansuri (flute) he holds with both his hands. His fingers are in a tapping position, and all beings - from humans to cows, gods to goddesses inside the sanctum are depicted as absorbed in the divine music. Some figures are shown running to listen to the music, their clothes slipping off. Above the householders, gopis and cows are shown rishis (sages) who too are lost in the experience.

On the fringe of the image&#x27;s &quot;torana&quot; (arch above) are carved the ten avatars of Vishnu in sequence: Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parasurama, Rama, Balarama, Buddha and Kalki.

====North shrine====
The north shrine entrance too has two dvarapalas: Bhadra and Subhadra. The lintel above the entrance shows Janardana while the canopy again shows Lakshminarayana. Past the Sukhanasi, the lintel shows a seated Lakshmi and the canopy shows a Yoganarayana doing yoga. The &quot;garbha griya&quot; has a 6 feet high statue, wherein the Garuda pedestal is 1.5 feet, and the image of Janardhana is 4.5 feet high. He wears jewelry, and on the fringe of his image&#x27;s &quot;torana&quot; are again carved the ten avatars of Vishnu.

====West shrine====
The west shrine entrance is similar to the southern sanctum in size and included features. The lintel above the entrance shows a standing Kesava while the canopy shows Gajalakshmi. Past the Sukhanasi, the lintel shows a Vaikuntha Narayana seated on Ananta Shesha and the canopy shows a Vishnu in Sukhasana yoga posture. The &quot;garbha griya&quot; has a Garuda pedestal that is 1.5 feet tall but the image is missing.

<text>The Gran Chaco or Dry Chaco is a sparsely populated, hot and semiarid lowland tropical dry broadleaf forest natural region of the R√≠o de la Plata basin, divided among eastern Bolivia, western Paraguay, northern Argentina, and a portion of the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, where it is connected with the Pantanal region. This land is sometimes called the Chaco Plain.

== Toponymy ==
The name Chaco comes from the Quechua word meaning &quot;hunting land&quot;, an indigenous language from the Andes and highlands of South America, and comes probably from the rich variety of animal life present throughout the entire region.

== Geography ==
The Gran Chaco is about 647,500km2 (250,000 sq mi) in size, though estimates differ. It is located west of the Paraguay River and east of the Andes, and is mostly an alluvial sedimentary plain shared among Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina. It stretches from about 17 to 33¬∞S latitude and between 65 and 60¬∞W longitude, though estimates differ.

Historically, the Chaco has been divided in three main parts: the &quot;Chaco Austral&quot; or Southern Chaco, south of the Bermejo River and inside Argentinian territory, blending into the Pampa region in its southernmost end; the &quot;Chaco Central&quot; or Central Chaco between the Bermejo and the Pilcomayo River to the north, also now in Argentinian territory; and the &quot;Chaco Boreal&quot; or Northern Chaco, north of the Pilcomayo up to the Brazilian Pantanal, inside Paraguayan territory and sharing some area with Bolivia.

Locals sometimes divide it today by the political borders, giving rise to the terms Argentinian Chaco, Paraguayan Chaco, and Bolivian Chaco. (Inside Paraguay, people sometimes use the expression Central Chaco for the area roughly in the middle of the Chaco Boreal, where Mennonite colonies are established.)

The Chaco Boreal may be divided in two: closer to the mountains in the west, the &quot;Alto Chaco&quot; (Upper Chaco), sometimes known as &quot;Chaco Seco&quot; (or Dry Chaco), is very dry and sparsely vegetated. To the east, less arid conditions combined with favorable soil characteristics permit a seasonally dry higher-growth thorn tree forest, and further east still higher rainfall combined with improperly drained lowland soils result in a somewhat swampy plain called the &quot;Bajo Chaco&quot; (Lower Chaco), sometimes known as &quot;Chaco H√∫medo&quot; (Humid Chaco). It has a more open savanna vegetation consisting of palm trees, quebracho trees, and tropical high-grass areas, with a wealth of insects. The landscape is mostly flat and slopes at a 0.004-degree gradient to the east. This area is also one of the distinct physiographic provinces of the Parana-Paraguay Plain division.

The areas more hospitable to development are along the Paraguay, Bermejo, and Pilcomayo Rivers. It is a great source of timber and tannin, which is derived from the native &quot;quebracho&quot; tree. Special tannin factories have been constructed there. The wood of the palo santo from the Central Chaco is the source of oil of guaiac (a fragrance for soap). Paraguay also cultivates mate in the lower part of the Chaco.

Large tracts of the central and northern Chaco have high soil fertility, sandy alluvial soils with elevated levels of phosphorus, and a topography that is favorable for agricultural development. Other aspects are challenging for farming: a semiarid to semihumid climate (600‚Äì1300mm annual rainfall) with a six-month dry season and sufficient fresh groundwater restricted to roughly one-third of the region, two-thirds being without groundwater or with groundwater of high salinity. Soils are generally erosion-prone once the forest has been cleared. In the central and northern Paraguay Chaco, occasional dust storms have caused major topsoil loss.

== History ==
The Chaco was occupied by nomadic peoples, notably the various groups making up the Guaycuru, who resisted Spanish control of the Chaco, often with success, from the 16th until the early 20th centuries.

Prior to national independence of the nations that compose the Chaco, the entire area was a separate colonial region named by the Spaniards as &quot;Chiquitos&quot;.

The Gran Chaco had been a disputed territory since 1810. Officially, it was supposed to be part of Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, although a bigger land portion west of the Paraguay River had belonged to Paraguay since its independence. Argentina claimed territories north of the Bermejo River until Paraguay&#x27;s defeat in the War of the Triple Alliance in 1870 established its current border with Argentina.

Over the next few decades, Bolivia began to push the natives out and settle in the Gran Chaco, while Paraguay ignored it. Bolivia sought the Paraguay River for shipping oil out into the sea (it had become a land-locked country after the loss of its Pacific coast in the War of the Pacific), and Paraguay claimed ownership of the land. This became the backdrop to the Gran Chaco War (1932‚Äì1935) between Paraguay and Bolivia over supposed oil in the Chaco Boreal (the aforementioned region north of the Pilcomayo River and to the west of the Paraguay River). Eventually, Argentine Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas mediated a ceasefire and subsequent treaty signed in 1938, which gave Paraguay three-quarters of the Chaco Boreal and gave Bolivia a corridor to the Paraguay River with the ability to use the Puerto Casado and the right to construct their own port. No oil was found in the region until 2012 when Paraguayan President Federico Franco announced the discovery of oil in the area of the Pirity river.
Mennonites immigrated into the Paraguayan part of the region from Canada in the 1920s; more came from the USSR in the 1930s and immediately following World War II. These immigrants created some of the largest and most prosperous municipalities in the deep Gran Chaco.

The region is home to over 9 million people, divided about evenly among Argentina, Bolivia, and Brazil, and including around 100,000 in Paraguay. The area remains relatively underdeveloped, In the 1960s, the Paraguayan authorities constructed the Trans-Chaco Highway and the Argentine National Highway Directorate, National Routes 16 and 81, in an effort to encourage access and development. All three highways extend about from east to west and are now completely paved, as is a network of nine Brazilian highways in Mato Grosso do Sul state.

== Flora ==

The Gran Chaco has some of the highest temperatures on the continent.

It has high biodiversity, containing around 3,400 plant species, 500 birds, 150 mammals, and 220 reptiles and amphibians.

The floral characteristics of the Gran Chaco are varied given the large geographical span of the region. The dominant vegetative structure is xerophytic deciduous forests with multiple layers, including a canopy (trees), subcanopy, shrub layer, and herbaceous layer. Ecosystems include riverine forests, wetlands, savannas, and cactus stands, as well.

At higher elevations of the eastern zone of the Humid Chaco, mature forests transition from the wet forests of southern Brazil. These woodlands are dominated by canopy trees such as &quot;Handroanthus impetiginosus&quot; and characterized by frequent lianas and epiphytes. This declines to seasonally flooded forests, at lower elevations, that are dominated by &quot;Schinopsis&quot; spp., a common plains tree genus often harvested for its tannin content and dense wood. The understory comprises bromeliad and cactus species, as well as hardy shrubs such as &quot;Schinus fasciculata&quot;. These lower areas lack lianas, but have abundant epiphytic species such as &quot;Tillandsia&quot;. The river systems that flow through the area, such as the Rio Paraguay and Rio Parana, allow for seasonally flooded semievergreen gallery forests that hold riparian species such as &quot;Tessaria integrifolia&quot; and &quot;Salix humboldtiana&quot;. Other seasonally flooded ecosystems of this area include palm-dominated (&quot;Copernicia alba&quot;) savannas with a bunch grass-dominated herbaceous layer.

To the west, in the Semiarid/Arid Chaco, medium-sized forests consists of white quebracho (&quot;Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco&quot;) and red quebracho (&quot;Schinopsis lorentzii&quot;) with a slightly shorter subcanopy made up of several species from the family Fabaceae, as well as several arboreal cacti species that distinguish this area of the Chaco. There is a scrub-like shrub and herbaceous understory. On sandy soils, the thick woodlands turn into savannas where the aforementioned species prevail, as well as species such as &quot;Jacaranda mimosifolia&quot;. The giant &quot;Stetsonia coryne&quot;, found throughout the western Semiarid/Arid region becomes very conspicuous in these sandy savannas. Various upland systems of plant associations occur throughout the Gran Chaco. The Highlands of the Argentinian Chaco are made up of, on the dry, sunny side (up to 1800m), &quot;Schinopsis haenkeana&quot; woodlands. The cooler side of the uplands hosts &quot;Zanthoxylum coco&quot; (locally referred to as Fagara coco) and &quot;Schinus molleoides&quot; (locally referred to as &quot;Lithrea molleoides&quot;) as the predominant species. Other notable species include &quot;Bougainvillea stipitata&quot;, and several species from the Fabaceae. The Paraguayan uplands have other woodland slope ecosystems, notably, those dominated by &quot;Anadenanthera colubrina&quot; on moist slopes. Both of these upland systems, as well as numerous other Gran Chaco areas, are rich with endemism.

== Fauna ==
Faunal diversity in the Gran Chaco is also high. The Gran Chaco has around 3,400 plant, 500 bird, 150 mammal, and 220 reptile and amphibian species. Animals typically associated with tropical and subtropical forests are often found throughout the eastern Humid Chaco, including jaguars, howler monkeys, peccaries, deer, and tapirs. &quot;Edentate&quot; species, including anteaters and armadillos, are readily seen here, as well. Being home to at least 10 species, the Argentinian Chaco is the location of the peak diversity for the armadillo, including species such as the nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;), whose range extends north to the southern US, and the southern three-banded armadillo (&quot;Tolypeutes matacus&quot;). The pink fairy armadillo (&quot;Chlamyphrous truncatus&quot;), is found nowhere else in the world. The giant armadillo (&quot;Priodontes maximus&quot;), while not found in the eastern Humid Chaco, can be seen in the drier Arid Chaco of the west. Some other notable endemics of the region include the San Luis tuco-tuco (&quot;Ctenomys pontifex&quot;). This small rodent is only found in the Argentinian Chaco. All of 60 species of &quot;Ctenomys&quot; are endemic to South America. The Chacoan peccary (&quot;Catagonus wagneri&quot;), locally known as &quot;tauga&quot;, is the largest of the three peccary species found in the area. This species was thought to be extinct by scientists until 1975, when it was recorded by Ralph Wetzel.

Due to the climate of the Gran Chaco, herpetofauna are restricted to moist refugia in various places throughout the chaco. Rotting logs, debris piles, old housing settlement, wells, and seasonal farm ponds are examples of such refugia. The black-legged seriema (&quot;Chunga burmeisteri&quot;), blue-crowned parakeet (&quot;Aratinga acuticadauta&quot;), Picui ground dove (&quot;Columbina picui&quot;), guira cuckoo (&quot;Guira guira&quot;), little thornbird (&quot;Phacellodomus sibilatrix&quot;), and many-colored Chaco finch (&quot;Saltaitricula multicolor&quot;) are notable of the 409 bird species that are resident or breed in the Gran Chaco; 252 of these Chaco species are endemic to South America.

== Conservation issues ==

The Chaco is one of South America&#x27;s last agricultural frontiers. Very sparsely populated and lacking sufficient all-weather roads and basic infrastructure (the Argentinian part is more developed than the Paraguayan or Bolivian part), it has long been too remote for crop planting. The central Chaco&#x27;s Mennonite colonies are a notable exception. Between 2000 and 2019, it was estimated that the Dry Chaco forest cover decreased by 20.2%, including territory in Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, with the latter showing the most dramatic land cover change.

Two factors may substantially change the Chaco in the near future: low land valuations and the region&#x27;s suitability to grow fuel crops. Suitability for the cultivation of &quot;Jatropha&quot; has been proven. Sweet sorghum as an ethanol plant may prove viable, too, since sorghum is a traditional local crop for domestic and feedstock use. The feasibility of switchgrass is currently being studied by Argentina&#x27;s Instituto Nacional de Tecnolog√≠a Agropecuaria, as is the Karanda&#x27;y palm tree in the Paraguayan Chaco.

While advancements in agriculture can bring some improvements in infrastructure and employment for the region, loss of habitat and virgin forest is substantial and will likely increase poverty. Paraguay, after having lost more than 90% of its Atlantic rainforest between 1975 and 2005, is now losing its xerophytic forest (dry forests) in the Chaco at an annual rate of (2008). In mid-2009, a projected law, initiated by the Liberal Party, that would have outlawed deforestation in the Paraguayan Chaco altogether, &quot;Deforestacion Zero en el Chaco&quot; did not get a majority in the parliament.

Deforestation in the Argentinian part of the Chaco amounted to an average of per year between 2001 and 2007. According to Fundaci√≥n Avina, a local NGO, on average, are cleared per day. The soy plantations not only eliminate the forest, but also other types of agriculture. Indigenous communities are losing their land to agribusinesses. Since 2007, a law is supposed to regulate and control the cutting of timber in the Gran Chaco, but illegal logging continues.

Among the aggressive investors in the Paraguayan Gran Chaco are U.S.-based agribusinesses Cargill Inc., Bunge Ltd., and Archer Daniels Midland Co.

== Protected areas ==
A 2017 assessment found that 176,715km2, or 22%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

In September 1995, the Kaa-Iya del Gran Chaco National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area was established in an area of the Chaco in Bolivia. It is administered and was established solely by the indigenous peoples, including the Izoce√±o Guaran√≠, the Ayoreode, and the Chiquitano.

Other protected areas include Defensores del Chaco National Park and Tinfunqu√© National Park in Paraguay, and Copo National Park and El Impenetrable National Park in Argentina.

<text>Edward Archibald Markham FRSL (1 October 1939 ‚Äì 23 March 2008), popularly known as Archie Markham, was a Montserratian poet, playwright, novelist and academic. He moved to the United Kingdom in 1956, where he remained for most of his life, writing as well as teaching at various academic institutions. He was known for writing subtle, witty and intelligent poetry, which refused to conform to the conventions, and stereotypes, of British and Caribbean poetry alike.

== Life ==

E. A. Markham was born into a large, middle-class family in Harris, Montserrat, in 1939. He attended the only grammar school on the island, before emigrating to the UK at the age of 17. In the UK, Markham read English and Philosophy at the University of Wales, Lampeter, from 1962 to 1965. He subsequently went on to research 17th-century comedy at the University of East Anglia, before taking up his first academic position as a lecturer at Kilburn Polytechnic (now the College of North West London).

On leaving Kilburn Polytechnic, Markham founded the Caribbean Theatre Workshop, which aimed to explore &quot;non-naturalistic ways of writing and playing&quot;, and which he led on a successful tour of Montserrat, Saint Vincent and other parts of the Eastern Caribbean in 1970‚Äì71. Shortly after his return from the tour, Markham left for France, where he worked, building houses with a French co-operative movement (the Cooperative Ouvri√®re du Batiment) in the Alpes-Maritimes, from 1972 to 1974. 

On returning to the UK, he joined a touring group called the Bluefoot Travellers, and was awarded a series of writing fellowships at Hull College (1978‚Äì79), in Brent, London (on a C. Day-Lewis Fellowship from 1979 to 1980), Ipswich (1986), and at the University of Ulster (1988‚Äì91). He also worked as an active member of numerous literary groups and committees, including the Poetry Book Society, the Poetry Society (General Council, 1976‚Äì77) and the Minority Arts Advisory Service (MAAS), whose magazine, &quot;Artrage&quot;, he edited from 1985 to 1987.

In a long itinerant period, he took a Voluntary Service Overseas position for two years (1983‚Äì85) in Papua New Guinea, working as media co-ordinator for the provincial authorities in Enga province. He would later recall this experience in his memoir, &quot;A Papua New Guinea Sojourn&quot; (1993). In 1997, he took up the position of Professor of Creative Writing at Sheffield Hallam University, where he co-founded the MA in creative writing and directed the biennial Hallam Literature Festival.

On the occasion of his 60th birthday, Sheffield Hallam published &quot;A Festschrift for E. A. Markham&quot; (1999), and in 2005, when Markham retired, the university made him an emeritus professor. He was awarded the Certificate of Honour by the government of Montserrat, in 1997; and was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2003.

In 2005, Markham moved to Paris, France. He died there, of a heart attack on Easter day, 23 March 2008, aged 68.

== Poetry and other works ==

Although Markham is mainly known for his poetry, he worked in many artistic genres across the years, producing plays, short stories, a novel and an autobiography as well as multiple collections of poetry. He found his first &quot;artistic outlet&quot; in drama, writing and producing a play called &quot;The Masterpiece&quot; while still at university in the early 1960s.

A defining characteristic of Markham&#x27;s work is his tireless exploration of multiple voices and perspectives. In a short introduction to his work entitled &quot;Many Voices, Many Lives&quot; (1989), he wrote: &quot;The dramatic revelation that poets [...] in the Caribbean had two voices ‚Äì nation language and Standard English ‚Äì released many energies; but we had to be sure that this wasn&#x27;t to be interpreted that we had &quot;only&quot; two voices, &quot;only&quot; two modes of expression [...] I was interested in testing the whole range of voices [...] that were possibly real for me&quot;

As part of his exploration of multiple personae, Markham often published his works under pseudonyms. In the 1970s, Markham wrote a series of poems (including &quot;Lambchops&quot;, &quot;Lampchops in Disguise&quot; and &quot;Philpot in the City&quot;) in the fictional personae of Paul St. Vincent ‚Äì a young, black man from Antigua, living in South London ‚Äì and these poems were published in St. Vincent&#x27;s name. Unlike much of Markham&#x27;s poetry, the Paul St. Vincent poems are mainly written in nation language. Later, in the 1980s, Markham wrote through the fictional persona of Sally Goodman: a white, Welsh feminist. Some of the &quot;Sally Goodman&quot; poems were later anthologised in Markham&#x27;s collection &quot;Living in Disguise&quot;. He argued that in inventing these multiple personae, &quot;the test was to force their creator to accommodate types of consciousness which, at the very least, served to enlarge one area of Westindianness&quot;.

Markham&#x27;s writing in genres other than poetry ‚Äì the short story, the novel, autobiography and travel-writing ‚Äì was well received by critics. In addition to his creative writing, Markham also edited two important anthologies of Caribbean writing: &quot;Hinterland: Caribbean Poetry from the West Indies and Britain&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Penguin Book of Caribbean Short Stories&quot; (1996).

(later Captain) Declan Murphy on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2014‚Äì2015).

Logue&#x27;s film work includes roles in &quot;Sneakers&quot; (1992), &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993), &quot;Little Women&quot; (1994), &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), &quot;Blade&quot; (1998), &quot;The Patriot&quot; (2000), &quot;American Splendor&quot; (2003), &quot;Zodiac&quot; (2007), &quot;The Cloverfield Paradox&quot; (2018), and &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot; (2021). He won the Sundance Film Festival&#x27;s Special Jury Prize for his performance in &quot;The Tao of Steve&quot; (2000).

==Early life and education==
Donal Francis Logue was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to Irish parents from County Kerry. His parents were Carmelite missionaries, and the family moved from Ireland to Canada to Boston and elsewhere before settling in Calexico, California, in the state&#x27;s Imperial Valley. There and in nearby El Centro, California, Logue grew up with three sisters‚ÄîKarina, Deirdre and Eileen‚Äîand their mother taught at Calexico High School and Vincent Memorial Catholic High School. Logue attended Central Union High School in El Centro, where he became interested in theater. With friend John Everly during what Logue called the &quot;summer during our sophomore year&quot;, he created the theater group Imperial Valley Players to perform in the school&#x27;s auditorium, mounting the theater of the absurd play &quot;Picnic on the Battlefield&quot; by Fernando Arrabal.

For part of his junior year of high school, Logue attended the Jesuit school St. Ignatius&#x27; College in Enfield Town, London, England. In 1983, while a high-school senior, Donal was elected president of the 37th session of the American Legion Boys Nation, representing California and becoming the first non-citizen elected Boys Nation president. He went on to study history at Harvard University, graduating in 1988. In the late 1980s, he worked as a road manager for such bands as Bullet LaVolta.

==Career==
After a few appearances in made for TV films, Logue appeared in the 1992 film &quot;Sneakers&quot;, playing Dr. Gunter Janek. Of his career start, Logue recalled,
In 1993, he portrayed Capt. Ellis Spear in &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, and a movie agent, Judd Bromell, on the &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; episode &quot;Baby Blues&quot;, then later appeared as an FBI agent in &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Squeeze.&quot; Logue&#x27;s character Jimmy The Cab Driver was a staple of MTV promos in the early 1990s. He also appeared in &quot;Blade&quot; and &quot;The Patriot&quot;, in 2000. He appeared in two of Edward Burns films: &quot;Purple Violets&quot; and &quot;The Groomsmen&quot;.

Logue&#x27;s portrayal as the lead in &quot;The Tao of Steve&quot; won him a Special Grand Jury Prize for best actor at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival, and was noticed by &quot;ER&quot; producer John Wells, who cast Logue in several episodes as Chuck Martin, a nurse Dr. Susan Lewis marries one weekend in Las Vegas on a whim, and later has a child with. Concurrent with the run on &quot;ER,&quot; Logue starred in the critically acclaimed comedy &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;. In December 2005, Logue had a pilot development deal for a new situation comedy on ABC television, originally titled &quot;I Want to Rob Mick Jagger&quot;. The pilot was picked up and debuted in the winter of 2006 under the name &quot;The Knights of Prosperity&quot;. The show disappeared from the ABC lineup in early March 2007.

Logue also appeared in a supporting role in &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot; (2005). Logue had appeared as Phil Stubbs in the original pilot for the NBC show &quot;Ed&quot;, but dropped out to star in the sitcom &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;. The first two and a half seasons of &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; were telecast on the Fox network; thereafter, the show moved to The WB for the remainder of its run. In 2002 and 2003, Logue appeared on the VH1 &quot;I Love...&quot; instalments &quot;&#x27;80s&quot;, &quot;&#x27;70s&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;80s Strikes Back&quot;. In 2010, Logue appeared on &quot;House, M.D.&quot; as millionaire patient Curtis Harry.

Logue also appeared in NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Dennis&quot;, in 2005, about a former child prodigy whose parents kick him out of the house and into the real world. It was not picked up, however. Logue co-starred with Nicolas Cage in the film &quot;Ghost Rider&quot;, the David Fincher film &quot;Zodiac&quot;, and alongside Mark Wahlberg in the 20th Century Fox film &quot;Max Payne&quot;. In 2007 he had an uncredited role in &quot;Monk&quot; Season 6 episode &quot;Mr. Monk Is Up All Night&quot; as a grifter Monk meets in a bar. In 2008, Logue appeared in the Jack Kerouac documentary &quot;One Fast Move or I&#x27;m Gone: Kerouac&#x27;s Big Sur&quot;. Logue starred as Captain Kevin Tidwell in the NBC crime drama &quot;Life&quot; from 2008 to 2009. On May 4, 2009, NBC announced &quot;Life&quot; would not be returning for a third season.

Logue starred in FX series &quot;Terriers&quot;, which ran 13 episodes from September to December 2010. After the show&#x27;s cancellation, a frustrated Logue briefly left acting for truck-driving, according to his friend and fellow actor W. Earl Brown. Logue starred as the main character in Theory of a Deadman&#x27;s music video for the song &quot;Lowlife&quot;, off their 2011 release &quot;The Truth Is...&quot;.

In late 2012, Logue joined the casts of &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; as renegade ex-U.S. Marshal Lee Toric who is out for revenge for the murder of his sister and &quot;Vikings&quot; as King Horik. In 2013, he joined the cast of BBC America&#x27;s show &quot;Copper&quot; as a returning Union General turned Tammany Hall insider, General Brendan Donovan, and he returned to &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; and &quot;Vikings&quot; to reprise his roles from the previous seasons. Logue had roles in two 2013: &quot;CBGB&quot; with Alan Rickman and &quot;9 Full Moons&quot; with Amy Seimetz and Bret Roberts.

Between March and May 2014, he appeared in six episodes of the NBC police procedural, crime, legal drama, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as Lieutenant Declan Murphy, a former undercover officer appointed as acting commander of the Special Victims Unit. From 2014 to the show&#x27;s conclusion in 2019, he portrayed Harvey Bullock in the police procedural series &quot;Gotham&quot;, based on the DC Comics Batman franchise.

In 2015, Logue appeared in Adam Massey&#x27;s thriller film &quot;The Intruders&quot;.

In 2021, Logue appeared in the FX series &quot;What We Do in the Shadows&quot;, portraying a fictionalized version of himself. He is at first mistaken for his &quot;Blade&quot; character of Quinn but explains that he had chosen to become a vampire after completing the movie &quot;Blade&quot;, as the vampire lifestyle appealed to him. This universe&#x27;s rendition of Logue has become a respected member of the Supreme Worldwide Vampiric Council, is actively in touch with the cast members of &quot;Grounded for Life&quot;, and is an avid painter.

==Personal life==
Logue travels back and forth to Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland, where his mother lives. He holds Canadian, Irish, and American citizenship.

Logue has homes in Los Angeles and in Shady Cove, Oregon, where he cofounded Frison Logue Hardwood. Logue regularly plays for the Los Angeles‚Äìbased amateur soccer team Hollywood United.

Logue has a Class-A Commercial Drivers License and is licensed to drive tractor-trailers with double or triple trailers, tankers and hazardous materials. He has a hardwood company with one partner called Frison-Logue Hardwood, and a trucking company called Aisling Trucking with two partners based out of Central Point, Oregon, which the three founded in 2012.

Logue was formerly married or in a long-term committed relationship with Kasey Walker, also known as Kasey Smith. They have a son named Finn, and a transgender daughter, Jade. On June 27, 2017, Logue posted a tweet saying Jade had gone missing; he later deleted it and launched a wider public appeal for help after contacting police and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. By July 8, over a week later, Jade had been found in North Carolina and was returned home safely.

<doc id="1092749" wikidata="Q898224" url="?curid=1092749" title="Tourism in Croatia">
<text>Tourism in Croatia () is a major industry of country&#x27;s economy, accounting for almost 20% of Croatia&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP) as of 2021.

The history of tourism in Croatia dates back to its time as part of Austria-Hungary when wealthy aristocrats would converge to the sea, but had expanded greatly in the 1960s and &#x27;70s under the economic policies of the former Yugoslavia. Today, Croatia is one of the most visited tourist destinations in the Mediterranean, with a total of 14 million tourists visiting in 2021.

Tourism in Croatia is concentrated in the areas along the Adriatic coast and is strongly seasonal, peaking in July and August. Eight areas in the country have been designated national parks and eleven as nature parks. Currently, there are ten sites in Croatia on the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites.

==History==

Since the late 1990s, Croatia has had one of the highest tourism growth rates in the world and this trend is expected to continue.
Between 2012 (the year before Croatia joined the EU) and 2019, the number of annual tourist arrivals increased by 8 million.
16 million foreign tourists - 4 times the country‚Äôs population - visited Croatia in 2018.
Economists argue that Croatia&#x27;s joining the EU made them a more desirable tourist location due to reinvestment in their economy, more open trade barriers, and lessened customs control.

Its main attractions are a 1,104-mile-long Mediterranean coastline plus 1,185 islands, and a rich cultural and historical heritage.
Only 15% of the coast, the main tourist attraction in Croatia, is urbanized, and plans are in progress to further develop Croatia&#x27;s tourism sector. The Croatian Tourism Development Strategy aims at making Croatia a globally recognized tourist destination for all seasons, and is working towards that goal by building more luxury accommodations, including hotels and tourist services, or renovating older ones. Croatia also has one of the UNWTO&#x27;s Sustainable Tourism Observatories, part of the organization&#x27;s International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). The observatory is considered a commitment to monitoring and building sustainable tourism.

== Tourist regions ==

Tourism is largely concentrated on the coastal areas, which are shared among seven counties. Another characteristic is its high level of seasonality.

The Croatian National Tourist Board has divided Croatia into six distinct tourist regions.

===Istria===
The west coast of the peninsula of Istria has several historical towns dating from Roman times, such as the city of Umag, which hosts the yearly Croatia Open ATP tennis tournament on clay courts.

The city of Poreƒç is known for the UNESCO-protected Euphrasian Basilica, which includes 6th-century mosaics depicting Byzantine art. The city plan still shows the ancient Roman Castrum structure with main streets &quot;Decumanus&quot; and &quot;Cardo Maximus&quot; still preserved in their original forms. &quot;Marafor&quot; is a Roman square with two temples attached. One of them, erected in the 1st century, is dedicated to the Roman god Neptune. Originally a Gothic Franciscan church built in the 13th century, the &#x27;Dieta Istriana&#x27; hall was remodeled in the Baroque style in the 18th century.

The region&#x27;s largest city Pula has one of the best preserved amphitheatres in the world, which is still used for festivals and events. It is surrounded by hotel complexes, resorts, camps, and sports facilities. Nearby is Brijuni national park, formerly the summer residence of late Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. Roman villas and temples still lie buried among farm fields and along the shoreline of surrounding fishing and farming villages. The coastal waters offer beaches, fishing, wreck dives to ancient Roman galleys and World War I warships, cliff diving, and sailing. Pula is the end point of the EuroVelo 9 cycle route that runs from Gda≈Ñsk on the Baltic Sea through Poland, Czechia, Austria, Slovenia and Croatia.
The town of Rovinj contains well-indented coastal areas with a number of small bays hidden within dense vegetation, open to naturists. Although the beaches are not specified as naturist, naturists frequent them.

The interior is green and wooded, with small stone towns on hills, such as Motovun. The river Mirna flows below the hill. On the other side of the river lies Motovun forest, an area of about 10 square kilometres in the valley of the river Mirna, of which 280 hectares (2.8¬†km2) are specially protected. This area differs not only from the nearby forests, but also from those of the entire surrounding karst region because of its wildlife, moist soil, and truffles (&quot;Tuber magnatum&quot;) that grow there. Since 1999, Motovun has hosted the international Motovun Film Festival for independent films from the U.S. and Europe. Gro≈ænjan, another hill town, hosts a three-week jazz festival every July.
&quot;Olive tourism&quot; 
is also on the increase in this region. Olive oil is among the most important agricultural activities in Istria and this region has therefore received a large part of the nation&#x27;s effort in rejuvenating the olive oil manufacturing that began around the turn of the new millennium: renovating and renewing of olive groves (18,683 ha of olive groves in Croatia in 2018, most of it near the coast yielding 5,000 tonnes olive oil / year), introduction of modern technologies in the production and processing of olives, storage of olive oil. Its olive oil has an exceedingly good reputation; in 2024 the olive oil guide Flos Olei has classed 69 Istrian producers among the 500 best producers worldwide. It is also a major part of the cultural history in the region, as witnessed by a 1,600 years old olive tree on the island of Veli Brijun (Brijuni National Park). &lt;br&gt;
As one of the forms of special interest tourism 
and a form of gastronomy-related tourism, oleotourism is very common in rural areas where it generates additional income for olive growers who market their produce directly to consumers; it also has a multifaceted education value; and it extends the seasonality of tourism - and of associated seasonal labour - into the Autumn season. The olive oil museum in the center of Pula includes a shop and allows for various activities (discovering, tasting, purchasing).

===Kvarner and Highlands===
One of the most varying regions, the entire Kvarner Gulf provides striking scenery, with tall mountains overlooking large islands in the sea. Opatija is the oldest tourist resort in Croatia, its tradition of tourism ranging from the 19th century.

The former Venetian island towns of Rab and Lo≈°inj are popular tourist destinations. The island of Rab is rich in cultural heritage and cultural-historical monuments. Rab is also known as a pioneer of naturism after the visit of Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson. The island offers nature, beaches, heritage, and events such as the Rab arbalest tournament and the Rab Medieval festival ‚Äì Rapska fjera. With around 2600 hours of sunshine a year, the island of Lo≈°inj is a tourist destination for Slovenians, Italians, and Germans in the summer months. Average air humidity is 70%, and the average summer temperature is and during the winter.

The interior regions Gorski Kotar, Velebit and Lika have mountain peaks, forests and fields, many animal species including bears, and the national parks of Risnjak and Plitvice Lakes. The Plitvice Lakes National Park lies in the Plitvice plateau which is surrounded by three mountains part of the Dinaric Alps: Plje≈°ivica (Gornja Plje≈°evica peak 1,640¬†m), Mala Kapela (Seli≈°ki Vrh peak at 1,280¬†m), and Medveƒëak (884¬†m). The national Park is underlain by karstic rock, mainly dolomite and limestone with associated lakes and caves, this has given rise to the most distinctive feature of its lakes. The lakes are separated by natural dams of travertine, which is deposited by the action of moss, algae, and bacteria. The encrusted plants and bacteria accumulate on top of each other, forming travertine barriers which grow at the rate of about 1¬†cm per year. The sixteen lakes are separated into an upper and lower cluster formed by runoff from the mountains, descending from an altitude of over a distance of some eight km, aligned in a south‚Äìnorth direction.
The lakes collectively cover an area of about two square kilometers, with the water exiting from the lowest lake to form the Korana River. The lakes are divided into the 12 Upper Lakes (&quot;Gornja jezera&quot;) and the four Lower Lakes (&quot;Donja jezera&quot;): Under the travertine waterfalls &quot;Cratoneuron&quot; moss sometimes grows, the moss gets encrusted with travertine and fresh moss grows further out, first a crag is formed but later a cave roof forms under the crag. If the water continues flowing the cave becomes progressively bigger. Limestone caves are present as well. The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species. Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and capercaillie can be found there, along with many more common species. At least 126 species of birds have been recorded there, of which 70 have been recorded as breeding.

===Dalmatia===
====Zadar====
This region caters to yachting and leisure travel. The Kornati National Park has hundreds of mostly uninhabited islands. Kornat, the biggest of the islands with a total area of , comprises two-thirds of the park&#x27;s land area. Although the island is 25.2¬†km long, it is no wider than 2.5¬†km. The park is managed from the town of Murter, on the island of Murter, and is connected to the mainland by a drawbridge.

Zadar, the largest city in the region, gained its urban structure in Roman times; during the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus, the town was fortified and the city walls with towers and gates were built. On the western side of the town were the forum, the basilica and the temple, while outside the town were the amphitheatre and cemeteries. The aqueduct which supplied the town with water is partially preserved. Inside the ancient town, a medieval town had developed with a series of churches and monasteries being built.

The interior has mixed plains and mountains, with the Paklenica canyon as the main attraction. Paklenica National Park is the most visited climbing site in Croatia, and the largest in Southeast Europe. The close proximity of seawater allows tourists to combine climbing, hiking and water sports. There are over 360 equipped and improved routes of various difficulty levels and lengths within Paklenica&#x27;s climbing sites. The main climbing season begins in spring and ends in late autumn. The park area contains 150‚Äì200¬†km of trails and paths intended either for tourists or mountaineers. The trails in the park are marked with boards and mountaineering signs.

The island of Pag has one of the biggest party zones in Europe in the town of Novalja and Zrƒáe. These beaches have all-hours discoth√®ques and beach bars operating during summer months.

====≈†ibenik====
This is another yachting region, dotted with islands, and centered on ≈†ibenik and the Cathedral of St James, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Several fortresses, remnants of the Renaissance era (which includes St. Nicholas Fortress) surround the city.

The interior has the Krka National Park with waterfalls and religious monasteries. Skradinski Buk has attractions and facilities available among various footpaths, sightseeing tours and presentations, boat trips, restaurants and a museum. Ro≈°ki Slap, located near Miljevci, is the second most popular attraction of the Krka National Park in terms of numbers of visitors, and its cascades can be visited throughout the year. Ro≈°ki Slap may be reached by excursion boat operated by the Krka National Park, although the falls can also be reached with a public road. Inside the park is the island of Visovac which was founded during the reign of Louis I of Hungary, home to the Roman Catholic Visovac Monastery founded by the Franciscans in 1445 near Miljevci village. The island can be visited by a boat tour from Skradinski Buk. The park also includes the Serbian Orthodox Krka monastery founded in 1345. 
The area around the city of Knin has medieval fortresses and archeological remains. The recently discovered Roman town Burnum is 18¬†km far from Knin in direction of Kistanje, which has the ruins of the biggest amphitheatre in Dalmatia built in 77 AD, which held 8,000 people, during the rule of Vespasian. The nearby villages Biskupija and Kapitul are archaeological sites from the 10th century where remains of medieval Croatian culture are found including churches, graves, decorations, and epigraphs.

====Split====
The coastal city of Split is also the second largest city in Croatia, and is known for its unique Roman heritage which includes UNESCO-protected Diocletian&#x27;s Palace. The city was built around the well-preserved palace, which is one of the most complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian Adriatic coast. The Split Cathedral stems from the palace.

The Makarska Riviera is a stretch of coastline that offers beaches, clubs, cafes, kayaking, sailing, and hiking along the Biokovo range. Makarska, Brela, Omi≈°, and Ba≈°ka Voda are the most popular.
The large islands of this region, include the town of Hvar, known for its fishing and tourism industries. Hvar has a mild Mediterranean climate and Mediterranean vegetation. The island promotes itself as &quot;the sunniest spot in Europe&quot;, with over 2715 hours of sunlight in an average year. Cultural and artistic events within the Hvar Summer Festival take place throughout the summer, from late June to late September. These events include classical music concerts performed by national and international artists, and performances by amateur groups from Hvar. The Gallery of Modern Art in Hvar is located in the Arsenal building, in the lobby of the historic Theatre of Hvar. The permanent display contains paintings, sculptures, and prints from the collection, and temporary exhibitions are organised within the museum project Summer of Fine Arts in Hvar.

The Cathedral of St. Stephen and the Bishop&#x27;s Palace have a Renaissance-baroque style, and a fa√ßade with three-cornered gable and a Renaissance Bell Tower in Romanesque style from the 16th century, created by Venetian artists.

Other notable islands in the region include Braƒç, ƒåiovo, ≈†olta, and Vis.


The old city of Trogir is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and contains a mixture of influence from the Hellenistic period, Romans, and Venetians with its Greek architecture, Romanesque churches, Renaissance and Baroque buildings. Trogir is the best-preserved Romanesque-Gothic complex in Central Europe. Trogir&#x27;s medieval core, surrounded by walls, comprises a preserved castle and tower and a series of dwellings and palaces from the Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque periods. Trogir&#x27;s grandest building is the Cathedral of St. Lawrence, whose main west portal is a masterpiece by Radovan, and the most significant work of the Romanesque-Gothic style in Croatia. Another notable attraction is the Kamerlengo Castle.

====Dubrovnik====

One of the best-known Croatian tourist sites is the fortified city of Dubrovnik with its Renaissance culture. The highlight is the Sponza Palace which dates from the 16th century and is currently used to house the National Archives. The Rector&#x27;s Palace is a Gothic-Renaissance structure that now houses a museum. Its fa√ßade is depicted on the reverse of the Croatian 50 kuna banknote, issued in 1993 and 2002.

The St. Saviour Church is another remnant of the Renaissance period, next to the Franciscan Monastery. The Franciscan monastery&#x27;s library possesses 30,000 volumes, 22 incunabula, 1,500 valuable handwritten documents. Exhibits include a 15th-century silver-gilt cross and silver thurible, an 18th-century crucifix from Jerusalem, a martyrology (1541) by Bernardin Guƒçetiƒá and illuminated Psalters. Dubrovnik&#x27;s most famous church is St Blaise&#x27;s Church, built in the 18th century in honor of Dubrovnik&#x27;s patron saint. Dubrovnik&#x27;s baroque Cathedral houses relics of Saint Blaise. The city&#x27;s Dominican Monastery resembles a fortress on the outside but the interior contains an art museum and a Gothic-Romanesque church. A treasure of the Dominican monastery is its library with over 220 incunabula, numerous illustrated manuscripts, a rich archive with manuscripts and documents and an extensive art collection. The main feature of Dubrovnik is its walls that run 2¬†km around the city. The walls run from four to six metres thick on the landward side but are thinner on the seaward side. The system of turrets and towers were intended to protect the city.

An excursion along the coast south of Dubrovnik to the area of Ljuta offers daytime cruise excursions with scenic views including water streams, historic water mills and the mountain range east of the coastal plateau.

Just off the coast of Dubrovnik is the forested island of Lokrum. The small island has a castle, a thousand-year-old Benedictine monastery, and a botanical garden initially started by Maximilian I of Mexico in the 19th century. Peacocks and peahens still roam the isle, descended from the original peafowls brought over by Maximilian.
The nearby islands include the historical island of Korƒçula. The Catholic inhabitants of Korƒçula keep alive old folk church ceremonies and a weapon dance, the More≈°ka, which dates back to the Middle Ages. Originally danced only on special occasions, in modern times there are performances twice a week for tourists. The main town&#x27;s historic sites include the central Romanesque-Gothic Cathedral of St Mark (built from 1301 to 1806), the 15th-century Franciscan monastery with Venetian Gothic cloister, the civic council chambers, the palace of the former Venetian governors, grand 15th and 16th-century palaces of the local merchant nobles, and the city fortifications.

Further along the Adriatic are the forests of Mljet island. Over 72% of the island of is forest. Its geological structure consists of limestone and dolomite forming ridges, crests and slopes. A few depressions on the island of Mljet are below sea level and are known as &quot;blatine&quot; (&quot;mud-lakes&quot;) or &quot;slatine&quot; (&quot;salt-lakes&quot;). During the rain seasons, all &quot;blatine&quot; are filled with water and turn to brackish during dry seasons.

==== Central and Northern Croatia ====
The northern part, with the hilly area of Zagorje and Meƒëimurje, is dotted with castles and spas, and the old city of Vara≈ædin. In Meƒëimurje, there are spas and facilities for recreation in Vuƒçkovec and around Sveti Martin na Muri, both in the northern part of the county and near the Mura. There are also more than 200 clubs for various sporting and recreational activities such as mountaineering, fishing, bowling, CB radio, parachuting and flying small aircraft, including unpowered gliders and powered hang gliders.

Vara≈ædin is also the host of the &quot;Radar festival&quot;, which hosts concerts at the end of summer. It has already hosted musical stars such as Bob Dylan, Carlos Santana, the Animals, Manic Street Preachers, Solomon Burke among others.
The Marian shrine of Marija Bistrica is the country&#x27;s largest pilgrimage spot. Hundreds of thousands of pilgrims visit the site every year where the 14th-century church has stood. The church is known for the statue known as &quot;Black Madonna with Child&quot;, dating to the Ottoman invasion in the 16th century when the statue was hidden in the church and then lost for decades until its discovery. Behind the church is the process of &quot;the Way of the Cross&quot;, in which pilgrims begin the trek that leads to Calvary Hill. Pope John Paul II visited the site in 1998 in his second tour of Croatia.

Central Croatia has some natural highlights, such as the Lonjsko Polje Nature Park. The southwest area is known for its forests and wilderness. Baroque churches are found throughout the area, along with other cultural architecture.

Ilok and the war-torn city of Vukovar are also points of interest in the area.

====Zagreb====
Like Prague or Budapest, Zagreb has a Central European feel to it, with a large and well-preserved old town on the hill and a 19th-century city center. The Croatian capital is also the country&#x27;s largest cultural center, with many museums and galleries.

The historical part of the city to the north of Ban Jelaƒçiƒá Square is composed of the Gornji Grad and Kaptol, a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours, the most recognizable building and symbol of Zagreb being the Zagreb Cathedral.

== Overtourism in Dubrovnik ==
Overtourism is a substantial issue in Dubrovnik Old Town.

The city is reported to be the most touristed in Europe ‚Äì more so than Venice and Barcelona - receiving 36 overnight tourists per resident per year. In 2019, the city welcomed almost 1.5 million overnight tourists against a population of just 41,000 people. Excessive visitors damage infrastructure and heritage sites, cause traffic jams and pollution, price out residents, and change neighborhood dynamics.

There are several reasons for its popularity. The success of HBO series Game of Thrones, for which Dubrovnik was a major filming location, has attracted around 60,000 people to the city per year according to the Zagreb Institute of Economics. The city is also a popular stop on European cruise itineraries ‚Äì in 2017, the city received 742,000 cruise tourists from 538 ships ‚Äì and the rise during the 2010s of European low-cost flights and affordable Airbnb listings.

In response to overcrowding concerns, in 2016, UNESCO threatened to remove Dubrovnik Old Town‚Äôs World Heritage status unless it started to curb tourism numbers.

In 2018 in an attempt to solve the overtourism problem, the city introduced staggered arrivals for cruise ships -- allowing only two to be in dock at one time - and limiting cruise arrivals into the historic core of the city to 4,000 per day, half the number recommended by UNESCO. Other measures to limit overcrowding introduced in 2018 included cutting 80% of souvenir stands and reducing outdoor seating at restaurants by 20%.

<doc id="1092757" wikidata="Q1032042" url="?curid=1092757" title="HMS Indefatigable (1909)">
<text>HMS &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was the lead ship of her class of three battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during the first decade of the 20th Century. When the First World War began, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was serving with the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) in the Mediterranean, where she unsuccessfully pursued the battlecruiser and the light cruiser of the German Imperial Navy as they fled toward the Ottoman Empire. The ship bombarded Ottoman fortifications defending the Dardanelles on 3 November 1914, then, following a refit in Malta, returned to the United Kingdom in February where she rejoined the 2nd BCS.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was sunk on 31 May 1916 during the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the war. Part of Vice-Admiral Sir David Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet, she was hit several times in the first minutes of the &quot;Run to the South&quot;, the opening phase of the battlecruiser action. Shells from the German battlecruiser caused an explosion ripping a hole in her hull, and a second explosion hurled large pieces of the ship 200¬†feet (60¬†m) in the air. Only three of the crew of 1,019 survived.

==Design and description==

No battlecruisers were ordered after the three ships in 1905 until &quot;Indefatigable&quot; became the lone battlecruiser of the 1908‚Äì1909 Naval Programme. A new Liberal Government had taken power in January 1906 and demanded reductions in naval spending, and the Admiralty submitted a reduced programme, requesting dreadnoughts but no battlecruisers. The Cabinet rejected this proposal in favour of two outmoded armoured cruisers but finally acceded to a request for one battlecruiser instead, after the Admiralty pointed out the need to match the recently published German naval construction plan and to maintain the heavy gun and armour industries. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;‚Ä≥s outline design was prepared in March 1908, and the final design, slightly larger than &quot;Invincible&quot; with a revised protection arrangement and additional length amidships to allow her two middle turrets to fire on either broadside, was approved in November 1908. A larger design with more armour and better underwater protection was rejected as too expensive.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship normally displaced and at deep load. She had a crew of 737 officers and ratings.

The ship was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . During her sea trials on 10 April 1911, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; reached a top speed of from after her propellers were replaced. She carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

The &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class had a main armament of eight breech-loading BL Mark X guns mounted in four hydraulically powered twin-gun turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: &#x27;P&#x27; was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while &#x27;Q&#x27; was situated starboard and aft. &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Their secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. They mounted two submerged torpedo tubes, one on each side aft of &#x27;X&#x27; barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.

The &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between and covered the end barbettes. Their armoured deck ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.

&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was unique among British battlecruisers in having an armoured spotting and signal tower behind the conning tower, protected by of armour. However, the spotting tower was of limited use, as its view was obscured by the conning tower in front of it and the legs of the foremast and superstructure behind it. During a pre-war refit, a rangefinder was added to the rear of the &#x27;A&#x27; turret roof, and this turret was equipped to control the entire main armament as an emergency backup for the normal fire-control positions.

===Wartime modifications===
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; received a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun on a high-angle Mark II mount in March 1915. It was provided with 500 rounds. All of her 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given gun shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two aft guns were removed at the same time.

She received a fire-control director between mid-1915 and May 1916 that centralised fire control under the director officer who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy since the ship&#x27;s roll no longer dispersed the shells as each turret fired on its own; also, the fire-control director could more easily spot the fall of the shells.

==Service==
===Early career===
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was laid down at the Devonport Dockyard, Plymouth on 23 February 1909. She was launched on 28 October 1909 and was completed on 24 February 1911. Upon commissioning, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; served in the 1st Cruiser Squadron, which in January 1913 was renamed the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS). C. F. Sowerby was appointed captain on 24 February 1913. In December of the same year, she transferred to the Mediterranean, where she joined the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron.

===Pursuit of &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;===

&quot;Indefatigable&quot;, accompanied by the battlecruiser and under the command of Admiral Sir Berkeley Milne, encountered the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and the light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot; on the morning of 4 August 1914, which were headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville. Britain and Germany were not yet at war, so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to re-coal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time, Germany had invaded Belgium and war had been declared, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay more than from the Italian coast precluded entering the Strait of Messina, from which they could have observed the port directly. Therefore, Milne stationed and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; at the northern exit of the strait, expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports. He stationed the light cruiser at the southern exit, and sent &quot;Indomitable&quot; to coal at Bizerte, where she was ready for action in the Western Mediterranean.

The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, toward Constantinople, trailed by &quot;Gloucester&quot;. Milne, still expecting Rear-Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August when he set sail at a leisurely for Cape Matapan, where &quot;Goeben&quot; had been spotted eight hours earlier. At 14:30, he received an incorrect message from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria-Hungary. War would not actually be declared until 12 August, and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne gave up the hunt for &quot;Goeben&quot;, following his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian break-out attempt. On 9 August, Milne was given clear orders to &quot;chase &quot;Goeben&quot; which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east.&quot; Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean, unaware that the &quot;Goeben&quot; did not intend to come out.

On 3 November 1914, Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty, ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the commencement of hostilities between Ottoman Turkey and Russia. The attack was carried out by &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships and . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before Britain&#x27;s formal declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire on 6 November. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by &quot;Inflexible&quot; on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta for a refit; she then sailed to England on 14 February and joined the 2nd BCS upon her arrival. The ship conducted uneventful patrols of the North Sea for the next year and a half. She was the temporary flagship of the 2nd BCS during April‚ÄìMay 1916, while her half-sister was under repair after colliding with &quot;Indefatigable&quot;‚Ä≥s other half-sister .

===Battle of Jutland===
On 31 May 1916, the 2nd BCS consisted of &quot;New Zealand&quot; (flagship of Rear-Admiral William Pakenham) and &quot;Indefatigable&quot;. The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Admiral Franz von Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German&#x27;s line of retreat and called his ships&#x27; crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and to reduce speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.

This began what was to be called the &quot;Run to the South&quot; as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with &quot;Indefatigable&quot; in the rear and furthest to the west, and &quot;New Zealand&quot; ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; aimed at and &quot;New Zealand&quot; targeted while remaining unengaged herself. By 15:54, the range was down to and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57.

Around 16:00, &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from &quot;Von der Tann&quot;. She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking towards the stern and listing to port. Her magazines exploded at 16:03 after more hits, one on the forecastle and another on the forward turret. Smoke and flames gushed from the forward part of the ship and large pieces were thrown into the air. It has been thought that the most likely cause of her loss was a deflagration or low-order explosion in &#x27;X&#x27; magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the steering control shafts, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. More recent archaeological evidence shows that the ship was actually blown in half within the opening minutes of the engagement with &quot;Von der Tann&quot; which fired only fifty-two shells at &quot;Indefatigable&quot; before the fore part of the ship also exploded. Of her crew of 1,019, only three survived. While still in the water, two survivors, Able Seaman Frederick Arthur Gordon Elliott and Leading Signalman Charles Farmer, found &quot;Indefatigable&#x27;s&quot; captain, C.F. Sowerby, who was badly wounded. Elliott and Farmer were later rescued by the German torpedo boat , but by then Sowerby had died of his injuries. A third survivor, Signalman John Bowyer, was picked up by another unknown German ship. He was incorrectly reported as a crew member from in &quot;The Times&quot; on 24 June 1916.

==&quot;Indefatigable&quot; today==
&quot;Indefatigable&quot;, along with the other Jutland wrecks, was belatedly declared a protected place under the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986, to discourage further damage to the resting place of 1,016 men. Mount Indefatigable in the Canadian Rockies was named after the battlecruiser in 1917. The wreck was identified in 2001, when it was found to have been heavily salvaged sometime in the past. The most recent survey of the wreck by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney revealed that the initial hits on the ship by &quot;Von der Tann&quot; caused &#x27;X&#x27; turret magazine to detonate, blowing off a portion of the ship from forward of the turret to the stern. The supersonic shock-wave such an explosion generated was probably the reason for the very heavy loss of life on board. The fore part of the ship simply drifted on under its own momentum, still under fire, until it foundered. The two halves of the wreck are separated on the seabed by a linear distance of over . The stern portion had not previously been discovered.

<text>Kamtapur People&#x27;s Party (KPP) is a political party working in the northern parts of the Indian state of West Bengal. KPP was founded in January 1996 by Atul Roy. KPP works amongst the Rajbanshi population. KPP demands the set up of a separate Kamtapur state and recognition of the dialect of the Rajbanshi/Rajbongshi/Kamatapuri as a separate language.

The student wing of KPP is the All Kamtapur Students Union. The women&#x27;s wing is called Kamtapur Women&#x27;s Rights Forum.

==History==
Ahead of the 2001 West Bengal assembly elections, KPP joined the All India Trinamool Congress-led Bangla Bachao Front.

In spring 2003, KPP suffered an internal division. Atul Roy, considered as a moderate, was dethroned and replaced by a more hardline leadership. Nikhil Roy became the new president of KPP and the general secretary was Subhas Burman. Atul Roy remained a member of the central committee.

Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, KPP formed a front together with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha.

In 2006, Atul Roy broke away from Kamtapur People&#x27;s Party to form a new party called the Kamtapur Progressive Party. However, Atul Roy and Nikhil Roy decided to end their dispute in October 2010 and Atul merged his party with Kamtapur People&#x27;s Party. There is only one Kamtapur People&#x27;s Party today. Atul Roy is the president of the party and Nikhil Roy is the general secretary.

<text>David Williams (October 21, 1754 ‚Äì August 2, 1831) was a militiaman from the state of New York during the American Revolution. In 1780, he was one of three men to capture British Major John Andr√©, who was convicted and executed as a spy for conspiring with treasonous Continental general and commandant of West Point Benedict Arnold.

Williams should not be confused with, and is not related to, David Williams (1759‚Äì1836) of Massachusetts, a participant in the Boston Tea Party.

==Biography==
Born in Tarrytown, New York, Williams had been a farmer before joining the Continental Army in 1775. Serving under Gen. Richard Montgomery, he took part in several campaigns. He was forced to leave active service in 1779 after his feet were badly frozen, leaving him partially disabled for life. Despite this condition, Williams continued to lend his support to the volunteer forces in his native area: overnight on September 22‚Äì23, 1780, he joined militiamen John Paulding and Isaac Van Wart as part of an armed patrol.

The three men seized British officer Major John Andr√© at a site in Tarrytown, now called Patriot&#x27;s Park. Williams searched Andr√© and discovered, hidden inside his boots, the documents of his secret communication with Continental officer Benedict Arnold. The militiamen, all yeomen farmers, refused Andre&#x27;s bribe and took the officer to Continental Army headquarters. Arnold&#x27;s plans to surrender West Point to the British were revealed and foiled, and Williams was among the witnesses when Andr√© was hanged as a spy.

With George Washington&#x27;s personal recommendation, the United States Congress awarded Williams, Paulding and Van Wart the first military decoration of the United States, the silver medal known as the Fidelity Medallion. Each of the three also received federal pensions of $200 a year. New York State awarded them valuable farms.

The three militiamen were highly celebrated in their lifetimes: commemorations large and small abound in Westchester (see below), and can be found in many disparate parts of the early United States. Among other honors, each of the men had his name given to a county in the new state of Ohio (1803): Williams County is in the extreme northwest corner of the state.

Still, Williams and the others did see their reputations impugned by some. Andr√© at his trial had insisted the men were mere brigands; sympathy for him remained in some more aristocratic American quarters (and grew to legend in England, where he was buried in Westminster Abbey). Giving voice to this sympathy, Representative Benjamin Tallmadge of Connecticut persuaded Congress not to grant the men a requested pension increase in 1817, publicly assailing their credibility and motivations. Tallmadge, in 1780 a major, was the officer to whom Andr√© was taken after his capture, and he said he believed Andr√©&#x27;s account over that of the three captors. He said Williams and the other two were &quot;of that class of people who passed between both armies, as often in one camp as in the other.&quot; He said that &quot;when Major Andr√©&#x27;s boots were taken off by them, it was to search for plunder, and not to detect treason.&quot; He asserted that &quot;if Andre could have given to these men the amount they demanded for his release, he never would have been hung for a spy, nor in captivity..&quot; Despite the slight, the men&#x27;s popular acclaim continued to grow throughout the 19th century to almost-mythic status. Some modern scholars interpreted the episode as a major event in early American cultural development, representing the apotheosis of the common man in the new society, even if that means both ignoring contemporary accounts of their character and actions and subsequent inflation of both during the nineteenth century.

Williams is buried in the Old Stone Fort Cemetery in Schoharie, New York, southwest of Albany. The inscription on his obelisk reads: &quot;He with his compatriots John Paulding and Isaac VanWart on the 22nd of September 1780, arrested Major John Andre and found on his person treasonable papers in the handwriting of Gen. Benedict Arnold, who sought by treachery to surrender the military post of West Point into the hands of the enemy. In resisting the great bribes of their prisoner for his liberty, they showed their incorruptible patriotism; the American army was saved, and our beloved Country became free.&quot;

==Legacy==
Williams is honored on the monument erected at the site of Major Andre&#x27;s capture in Tarrytown, New York, on the east bank of the Hudson. The community has streets named for all three men. Three streets in nearby Elmsford, NY, are also named for them - although Williams Street was virtually eliminated in the 1960s by construction of I-287; it remains only as a short service road between the highway and Route 9A. Ohio&#x27;s Williams County is also named after David Williams (see also Van Wert and Paulding Counties, also in Ohio.)

<text>1870s fashion in European and European-influenced clothing is characterized by a gradual return to a narrow silhouette after the full-skirted fashions of the 1850s and 1860s.

==Women&#x27;s fashions==

===Overview===
By 1870, fullness in the skirt had moved to the rear, where elaborately draped overskirts were held in place by tapes and supported by a bustle. This fashion required an underskirt, which was heavily trimmed with pleats, flounces, rouching, and frills. This fashion was short-lived (though the bustle would return again in the mid-1880s), and was succeeded by a tight-fitting silhouette with fullness as low as the knees: the &quot;cuirass&quot; bodice, a form-fitting, long-waisted, boned bodice that reached below the hips, and the princess sheath dress. Sleeves were very tight fitting. Square necklines were common.

Day dresses had high necklines that were either closed, squared, or V-shaped. Sleeves of morning dresses were narrow throughout the period, with a tendency to flare slightly at the wrist early on. Women often draped overskirts to produce an apronlike effect from the front.

Gowns had low necklines and very short, off-the-shoulder sleeves, and were worn with short (later mid-length) gloves. Other characteristic fashions included a velvet ribbon tied high around the neck and trailing behind for evening in a similar style to Georgian era fashion (the origin of the modern choker necklace).

===Tea gowns and artistic dress===

Under the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and other artistic reformers, the &quot;anti-fashion&quot; for Artistic dress with its &quot;medieval&quot; details and uncorseted lines continued through the 1870s. Newly fashionable tea gowns, an informal fashion for entertaining at home, combined Pre-Raphaelite influences with the loose sack-back styles of the 18th century.

===Leisure Dress===

Leisure dress was becoming an important part of a woman&#x27;s wardrobe. Seaside dress in England had its own distinct characteristics but still followed the regular fashions of the day. Seaside dress was seen as more daring, frivolous, eccentric, and brighter. Even though the bustle was extremely cumbersome, it was still a part of seaside fashion.

===Undergarments===
With the narrower silhouette, emphasis was placed on the bust, waist and hips. A corset was used to help mold the body to the desired shape. This was achieved by making the corsets longer than before, and by constructing them from separate shaped pieces of fabric. To improve support, corsets were reinforced with many strips of whalebone, cording, or pieces of leather. Steam-molding, patented in 1868, helped hold the curvaceous contour.

Skirts were supported by a hybrid of the bustle and crinoline or hooped petticoat sometimes called a &quot;crinolette&quot;. The cage structure was attached around the waist and extended down to the ground, but only extended down the back of the wearer&#x27;s legs. The crinolette itself was quickly superseded by the true bustle, which was sufficient for supporting the drapery and train at the back of the skirt.

===Hairstyles and headgear===

In keeping with the vertical emphasis, hair was pulled back at the sides and worn in a high knot or cluster of ringlets, often with a fringe (bangs) over the forehead. False hair was commonly used. Bonnets were smaller to allow for the elaborately piled hairstyles and resembled hats except for their ribbons tied under the chin. Smallish hats, some with veils, were perched on top of the head, and brimmed straw hats were worn for outdoor wear in summer.

===Wraps and Overcoats===

The main kind of wrap that dominated in the 1870s were capes and jackets that had a back vent in order to make room for the bustle. Some examples are the pelisse and the paletot coat.

==Men&#x27;s fashion==
Innovations in men&#x27;s fashion of the 1870s included the acceptance of patterned or &quot;figured&quot; fabrics for shirts and the general replacement of neckties tied in bow knots with the four-in-hand and later the ascot tie.

===Coats and trousers===
Frock coats remained fashionable, but new shorter versions arose, distinguished from the sack coat by a waist seam. Waistcoats (U.S. &quot;vests&quot;) were generally cut straight across the front and had collars and lapels, but collarless waistcoats were also worn.

Three-piece suits consisting of a high-buttoned sack coat with matching waistcoat and trousers, called &quot;ditto suits&quot; or (UK) &quot;lounge suits&quot;, grew in popularity; the sack coat might be cutaway so that only the top button could be fastened.

The cutaway morning coat was still worn for informal day occasions in Europe and major cities elsewhere. Frock coats were required for more formal daytime dress. Formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers. The coat now fastened lower on the chest and had wider lapels. A new fashion was a dark rather than white waistcoat. Evening wear was worn with a white bow tie and a shirt with the new winged collar.

Topcoats had wide lapels and deep cuffs, and often featured contrasting velvet collars. Furlined full-length overcoats were luxury items in the coldest climates.

Full-length trousers were worn for most occasions; tweed or woollen breeches were worn for hunting and hiking.

In 1873, Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis began to sell the original copper-riveted blue jeans in San Francisco. These became popular with the local multitude of gold seekers, who wanted strong clothing with durable pockets.

===Shirts and neckties===
The points of high upstanding shirt collars were increasingly pressed into &quot;wings&quot;.

Necktie fashions included the four-in-hand and, toward the end of the decade, the ascot tie, a tie with wide wings and a narrow neckband, fastened with a jewel or stickpin. Ties knotted in a bow remained a conservative fashion, and a white bowtie was required with formal evening wear.

A narrow ribbon tie was an alternative for tropical climates, and was increasingly worn elsewhere, especially in the Americas.

===Accessories===
Top hats remained a requirement for upper class formal wear; bowlers and soft felt hats in a variety of shapes were worn for more casual occasions, and flat straw boaters were worn for yachting and other nautical pastimes.

==Children&#x27;s fashion==
Infants continued to be dressed in flowing gowns, a style that continued into the early 20th century. Gender dress changes often did not occur until a child was five or six; however, in the later decades gender dress came much sooner. Girls&#x27; ages could be depicted often based on the length of their skirt. As the girls got older, they wore longer skirts. A four-year-old would wear her skirt slightly above knee length; ten to twelve at mid-knee; twelve to fifteen varied from below the knee to mid-calf; and by sixteen or seventeen, a girl&#x27;s dress would be just above ankle length. The age of a boy could often be decided based on the length and type of trouser or how similar the attire was to that of a man&#x27;s. Boys often dressed similar to adult males, as they too wore blazers and Norfolk jackets.

Much influence on the styles of children&#x27;s dress came from artist Kate Greenaway, an illustrator of children&#x27;s books. She strongly influenced styles of young girls&#x27; dress, as she often showed girls dressed in empire styles in her books. The idea of children&#x27;s dress being taken from books is also found is styles such as the Little Lord Fauntleroy suit which was worn by the hero of a children&#x27;s book published in 1885-86.

<text>A walking day is a type of church parade. Walking days are most common in North West England, where they are an annual event for many towns and villages. In some rural communities in the North West they are known as Field Days, Gala Days or Club Days.

There may be several churches involved in a local walking day, however, most &#x27;church&#x27; walking days are held individually for each church (the Walking Days in Warrington are a notable exception to this as they all benefit from the participation of multiple churches from many denominations). The churches hire bands to provide music: for instance brass bands, pipe bands and marching bands. The police provide an escort and control the road traffic, but some police forces are now refusing to provide escorts out of public funds, and this may threaten many of these traditional events.

Children play a big part through their churches, schools, the Boys&#x27; Brigade, the Scouts and the Girl Guides.

Non-church processions are often led by a young lady, who has been crowned the &quot;Rose Queen&quot; for the year. The Queen may be particular to a church but can represent the whole village too. Indeed, some Rose Queens and May Queens have festivals of their own. For example, there is the &quot;Lymm May Queen&quot;, &quot;Knutsford May Queen&quot; and the &quot;Thelwall Rose Queen&quot;

Walking days are particularly common in the Warrington, St Helens, Prescot and Wigan areas. They are held annually in most districts, including:

* Grappenhall
* Orford
* Padgate
* Penketh
* Stockton Heath
* Stretton
* Warrington
* Winwick
* Rainford
* Ashton-in-Makerfield
* Haydock
* Newton le Willows

Some walking days, including those held in Warrington, Orford, Padgate, Stockton Heath and Stretton, are followed by a fair. A particular feature of the walks is that the spectators lining the streets, when they see children they know walking in the parade, will run out into the road and give the children money. The children often use the money collected in this way to spend on the fair later in the day.

Warrington Walking Day itself dates back to 1834, and is perhaps the largest in terms of attendance and participation. Churches now walk in ecumenical groups from each area. Most businesses in the town used to close for the day, but as Warrington has expanded, many firms have national and international business that demands attention. A detailed history of Warrington Walking Day can be found in the University of Sheffield National Fairground Archive.

<doc id="1092791" wikidata="Q3987626" url="?curid=1092791" title="The Howard Stern Show">
<text>The Howard Stern Show is an American radio show hosted by Howard Stern that gained wide recognition when it was nationally syndicated on terrestrial radio from WXRK in New York City, between 1986 and 2005. The show has aired on Howard 100 and Howard 101, Stern&#x27;s two uncensored channels on the subscription-based satellite radio service SiriusXM, since 2006. Other prominent staff members include co-host and news anchor Robin Quivers, writer Fred Norris and executive producer Gary Dell&#x27;Abate, along with former members Jackie Martling, Billy West, John Melendez, and Artie Lange.

Stern began his radio career in the mid-1970s and developed his show through morning positions at WRNW in Briarcliff Manor, New York, WCCC-FM in Hartford, Connecticut, and WWWW in Detroit. In 1981, he began at WWDC-FM in Washington, D.C., where he was first paired with Quivers and became a ratings success. That was followed by three years at WNBC in New York City. After his abrupt firing, Stern moved to WXRK where he remained for 20 years until December 2005. During this time, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; was syndicated to 60 radio markets and gained an audience of 20 million listeners at its peak. In the New York area, it was the highest-rated morning radio program from 1994 to 2001. The show is also the most fined, after a total of $2.5 million in fines were issued by the Federal Communications Commission for indecent material. In 2004, Stern signed the first of several five-year contracts with Sirius; the first was reportedly worth $500 million.

In addition to radio broadcast, &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; has been filmed since 1994 and broadcast on various networks, including the E! and CBS television channels. It moved to &quot;HowardTV&quot;, Stern&#x27;s own on-demand digital cable channel from 2005 to 2013. In 2018, Sirius XM launched a mobile app for subscribers to access video clips of the show.

==History==
===1975‚Äì1981: Early development===

Stern landed his first professional radio job while at Boston University, performing on-air skits, news casting and production duties at 1550 WNTN in Newton, Massachusetts, from August to December 1975. He also hosted a show with three fellow students on WTBU, campus radio station, named &quot;The King Schmaltz Bagel Hour&quot; which was cancelled during its first broadcast for a sketch called &quot;Godzilla Goes to Harlem&quot;. After his graduation, Stern landed some cover shifts in December 1976 at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York, where he was subsequently hired full-time working middays. He produced more creative commercials by calling the owners of businesses on the air, which he wrote &quot;was mind-blowing to everyone there.&quot;

In 1979, Stern responded to an advertisement for a &quot;wild, fun morning guy&quot; at WCCC-FM, an album oriented rock (AOR) station in Hartford, Connecticut. He produced a more outrageous audition tape, playing Robert Klein and Cheech and Chong records mixed with flatulence routines and one-liners. He was hired for the job, his first in a large radio market. As the station&#x27;s public affairs director, Stern also hosted a half-hour interview show on Sunday mornings, which he enjoyed as it contained no music. He would ask unusual questions to his guests, such as their dating habits. Stern held a two-day boycott of Shell Oil Company during the summer of the 1979 energy crisis, which put Stern and the station into the national news. Stern also began his &quot;Dial-a-Date&quot; routines at WCCC, and met Fred Norris, the station&#x27;s overnight disc jockey who provided Stern&#x27;s show with various comedic impressions of celebrities. Norris would join the show as Stern&#x27;s writer and producer in 1981.

Stern left WCCC for being denied a raise in salary. He began a new morning shift at WWWW, a struggling rock outlet in Detroit, Michigan, on April 21, 1980. He learned to become more open on the air and &quot;decided to cut down the barriers¬†... strip down all the ego¬†... and be totally honest¬†... I still sounded like an FM announcer&quot;. Stern held a bra-burning event and wrestled women outside the studios, and invited listeners to confess the most outrageous places where they had sex, and record their calls for the air. A stunt in which listeners paid $1.06 (the station&#x27;s FM frequency) to hit a Japanese car with a sledgehammer earned Stern national mention. For his performance, Stern won a &quot;Billboard&quot; award for &quot;Best Album-Oriented Rock Disc Jockey&quot; and was featured in the Drake-Chenault &quot;Top Five Talent Search&quot; contest in the AOR category. Published in January 1981, the fall Arbitron ratings showed that Stern trailed his three rock competitors with a 1.6% market share of the listening audience during an average quarter-hour. It was the final straw for management, which turned WWWW into a more successful country music format on January 18. Stern made a brief, half-hearted attempt to be a country radio DJ but realized it wasn&#x27;t to his liking. Stern left the station soon after and declined offers to work at CHUM in Toronto, WXRT in Chicago and WPLJ in New York City.

===1981‚Äì1985: Washington and WNBC===
On March 2, 1981, Stern began his third morning job, this time at WWDC-FM, a rock station in Washington, D.C. He was determined to become a success, and noticed the importance of news segments for satire. He requested for a news person to riff with him in the studio and not just deliver news briefs, returning to the newsroom when they were finished. Management planned to pair Stern with Star Archambeault of Portland, Oregon, but during a dispute about who had the bigger breasts and a no holds barred mud fight, Robin Quivers, a news anchor and consumer reporter from WFBR in Baltimore was eventually chosen. She agreed to meet Stern after hearing him interview a sex worker on the air. Quivers at first &quot;thought I would come in and do the news¬†... but it wasn&#x27;t that way¬†... he wanted someone to play off of¬†... he wanted a real live person there with him&quot;. The show began to break format, and Stern held a lesbian edition of &quot;Dial-a-Date&quot; in May 1981. He formed the Think Tank, a cohesive trio of male listeners who conversed with Stern and played along with quizzes and routines, which helped the show sound more natural. By January 1982, Stern had the second highest-rated morning program in the city. On January 14, one day after the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, Stern made listeners believe he asked Air Florida the price of a one-way ticket to the 14th Street Bridge, the location of the disaster. &quot;Is that going to be a permanent stop?&quot; asked Stern. On June 29, 1982, Stern&#x27;s contract at WWDC was terminated. Later, he wrote that the Air Florida segment was not the reason for his departure, nor did anyone complain about it. He had signed a contract with WNBC in March, and began to berate management and other DJs on the air. Quivers, who left the show early on June 17, worked at WCBM in Baltimore until rejoining with Stern on October 18, 1982. Stern presented a farewell show two weeks later on competing station WAVA-FM. He had more than tripled the station&#x27;s ratings during his stay.
Stern began his WNBC program in September 1982, working from 4‚Äì8 pm. Concerned about its corporate image and his risque personality, management told Stern to avoid discussions of a sexual and religious nature. Within his first month at the station, Stern was suspended for several days for a controversial segment known as &quot;Virgin Mary Kong&quot;. The skit featured a new video game by God in which a group of men chase the Virgin Mary around a singles bar in Jerusalem. In February 1983, comedian Jackie Martling was hired to make weekly appearances as a comedy writer. With his on-the-fly style, he provided jokes for such show bits like &quot;Stump the Jokeman&quot; and &quot;The Match Game&quot;. Martling assumed his role full-time in August 1986 when he replaced Al Rosenberg, a comedian and writer at WNBC who could no longer commute from Washington, D.C. Also hired was Gary Dell&#x27;Abate of the station&#x27;s traffic department, who started as the show&#x27;s assistant in September 1984 and went on to become executive producer. Stern continued to break out of the station&#x27;s strict format. He had a naked woman on the show for the first time and attempted to make another reach orgasm through her radio speaker, both of which were reenacted in his film &quot;Private Parts&quot; (1997).

The Arbitron ratings released in 1984 showed an increase in listeners to Stern&#x27;s show. Having moved shifts to 3‚Äì7 pm, he attracted audience shares of 3.8%, 4.2%, and 4.6% that year. The show was popular among males aged between 18 and 34, a highly-marketable demographic for advertisers. Stern acquired a 5.7% share in 1985, the highest rating at the station in four years, pushing the station&#x27;s ranking in afternoons from eleventh to first place in three years. Among the success, tension between management and Stern grew further. On September 30, 1985, the show was cancelled due to what management termed as &quot;conceptual differences&quot; between themselves and Stern regarding his show. &quot;Over the course of time, we made a very conscious effort to make Stern aware that certain elements of the program should be changed&quot;, said program director John Hayes, whom Stern had nicknamed &quot;The Incubus&quot;. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s appropriate to say what those specifics were.&quot; In 1992, Stern believed that Thornton Bradshaw, at the time chairman of RCA which then owned WNBC, was driving in his limousine having heard his &quot;Bestiality Dial-a-Date&quot; segment and ordered his firing. Later, NBC chairman Grant Tinker admitted that it was his decision, after corporate communications director Bob Rukeyser alerted him about the risqu√© material on Stern&#x27;s show.

===1985‚Äì1994: WXRK and start of syndication===
Stern returned to the New York airwaves on rock station WXRK, where he began his 20-year residency at the station in afternoons from 2‚Äì6 pm on November 18, 1985. Following his move to mornings from 6 am on February 18, 1986, Stern entered national syndication on August 18, 1986, when WYSP in Philadelphia first simulcast the program. In the 18-plus male demographic, WYSP rose from eleventh to second place in three months. Stern began a rivalry with the number one host John DeBella of WMMR, and was determined to beat him in the ratings. He achieved his goal in April 1990, and held a celebratory &quot;funeral&quot; for DeBella on May 10 in Rittenhouse Square which aired live.

By early 1987, Stern had almost completely stopped playing music during the show and was reaching almost 800,000 listeners each week in the New York area. Between September 1986 and February 1987, Stern hosted a three-hour Saturday morning program with a live audience which was syndicated to 45 markets across the country by DIR Broadcasting. The show added two new staff in 1988‚Äîimpressionist Billy West and intern &quot;Stuttering John&quot; Melendez, who would achieve notoriety by asking celebrities awkward questions on the red carpet and press conferences. That year, Stern returned to the Washington, D.C., market after a six-year absence when he was syndicated on WJFK, his third affiliate.

In July 1991, the show began to air on KLSX in Los Angeles. Listeners jammed the station&#x27;s switchboard during the first simulcast with mostly negative calls about the change. Stern rivaled with the KLOS morning team of Mark and Brian, who for three years had the area&#x27;s top-rated program. In January 1992, Stern reached the number one spot in New York by overtaking the news station WINS, who had enjoyed a ten-year reign. He was reaching over one million listeners a week there, and hosted a live victory parade in Times Square to celebrate. In October 1992, Stern became the first person to have the number one show in New York and Los Angeles simultaneously, as he acquired a 9.5% market share in New York and 6.4% in Los Angeles. His victory funeral for Mark and Brian was held in the parking lot of the Los Angeles Palace Theatre in November 1992. By this time, advertisers in New York were charged as much as $3,000 per minute, and $1,500 in Los Angeles, for a one-minute commercial on the show. In January 1993, Stern overtook Philadelphia news station KYW-AM in the morning ratings, which ended the station&#x27;s 14-year run at number one. Following his 1992 debut on WNCX in Cleveland, Stern took the station from thirteenth in mornings to first place in under two years. On June 10, 1994, during the city&#x27;s funeral broadcast William Alford, an engineer of competing station WMMS, cut a wire used for the show&#x27;s satellite feed which stopped the broadcast temporarily. Alford was later sentenced to ten days in jail and a $1,000 fine.

In June 1994, robotic cameras were installed in the WXRK studio to film the radio show for a condensed half-hour program on E!. &quot;Howard Stern&quot; ran for 11 years until the last original episode aired on July 8, 2005. In conjunction with his move to satellite radio, Stern launched Howard Stern on Demand, a subscription-based video-on-demand service, on November 18, 2005. The service was relaunched as Howard TV on March 16, 2006.

On December 7, 1994, Stern made national news when he prevented a man from committing suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge. The man, Emilio Bonilla, had called into the radio show from the bridge. He was kept on the line for five minutes until Port Authority Police, whose tour commander was listening to the show, took Bonilla into custody. Bonilla, who was charged with cocaine possession and reckless endangerment, was taken to the hospital. Senator Al D&#x27;Amato and Ed Koch, former-Mayor of New York City, called in to congratulate Stern.
===1995‚Äì1999: Selena, Canada, and Columbine controversies===
On April 3, 1995, three days after the shooting of singer Selena which happened to be the same day she would be laid to rest in Corpus Christi, Texas a rift in the Hispanic community occurred after Stern commented on her music and Spanish people. After a song of hers was played with gunshot sound effects, Stern said &quot;Spanish people have the worst taste in music. They have no depth. Alvin and the Chipmunks have more soul.&quot; He called one of her records &quot;awful music that could only be popular with that segment of society.&quot; Callers to KEGL in Dallas, Texas, jammed the station&#x27;s switchboards. The League of United Latin American Citizens attempted to get Stern off the air, while listeners called for boycotts against his advertisers. Stern responded to the reaction with a statement in Spanish, arguing that his comments were not intended to cause pain to her family, friends and loved ones. Justice of the Peace Eloy Cano of Harlingen, Texas, issued an arrest warrant on Stern for disorderly conduct, which remained in place for a year after the incident.

&quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; was syndicated to 26 stations nationwide by the end of 1995, and was the subject of two &quot;Billboard&quot; awards for Network/Syndicated Program of the Year in the modern rock and mainstream rock categories in 1996. In February 1996, Stern announced the Howard Stern Radio Network, an agreement that let him form a network consisting of radio personalities that he approved. Stations would be able to choose shows from a 24-hour menu or carry the network&#x27;s programming around the clock. In November, the show relocated to a new studio in New York City, four times the size of its former location that housed space for bands to perform. Live performances increased then on, including those by Bush, Stone Temple Pilots, Cheap Trick and White Zombie, in the first four months. By the end of 1996, the show aired on 34 stations.

In December 1997, Martling began a six-week absence from the show as he was unable to reach an agreement with Infinity during contract negotiations. In mid-1998, &quot;Talkers&quot; magazine named the show as the most-listened to radio show in the US, with an estimated 17.5 million listeners each week. In the New York City area alone, one in four men aged 18‚Äì34 of the listening audience were tuning in.

The show aired on Canadian airwaves for the first time on September 2, 1997, to CHOM in Montreal and CILQ in Toronto. Stern&#x27;s comments about French people and their language caused a rift with some listeners. &quot;There is something about the language that turns you into a pussy-assed jack off... Anybody who speaks French is a scumbag. It turns you into a coward. Just like in World War II, they would not stick up for us. The French were the first ones to cave in to the Nazis, and certainly, certainly were over-productive for the Nazis, when they became their puppets.&quot; The show also received complaints from Canadian listeners for alleged sexist, racist, homophobic and improper sexual comments. Ratings for the two stations increased nonetheless by 62% and 47% respectively. Following listener complaints and censorship enforced by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, the show was cancelled in Montreal in 1998 and in Toronto in 2001.

A day after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton, Colorado, on April 20, 1999, Stern&#x27;s comments regarding the incident drew criticism from some listeners. &quot;There were some really good looking girls running out with their hands over their heads¬†... Did [the suspects] try to have sex with any of the good looking girls?¬†... At least if you are going to kill yourself and kill all the kids, why wouldn&#x27;t you have some sex?¬†... If I was going to kill some people, I&#x27;d take them out with sex.&quot; Hundreds complained to KXPK, the show&#x27;s affiliate in Denver. Stern argued his comments were taken out of context, and accused critics of being overly sensitive. &quot;I dared to ask if kids had sex. So what? That&#x27;s how I think. I had zero intent to make fun of the situation. The point in making that comment was an attempt to try to understand a motive. We didn&#x27;t know anything about motives [the morning after] and were trying to consider all possibilities.&quot;

In May 1999, Stern made headlines after former child star Dana Plato committed suicide one day after visiting the show. Plato had been living in Tulsa, Oklahoma, surrounded by rumors of her sexuality and drug abuse, which became the biggest topic of the interview. After telling Stern she had been sober for over a decade and denying rumors about her lesbian relationship, some callers accused her of lying. At some point Stern suggested that Plato do a urinalysis to prove them wrong, while Plato agreed to give a hair sample for analysis. Plato was crying several times, mostly while offering her gratitude to callers who believed everything she had said. Stern also asked her if she had ever considered suicide to which she replied, &quot;Hell no. I&#x27;ve got a beautiful boy. I&#x27;m OK in my skin. I&#x27;m OK with who I am.&quot; Plato died of a drug overdose the next day.

===2000‚Äì2005: Staff changes and terrestrial radio departure===

In December 2000, Stern renewed his contract with Infinity Broadcasting to continue the radio show for five years. Industry analysts questioned Stern&#x27;s relevance as the show&#x27;s ratings had declined since 1998, including a 20 per cent drop in listeners in Los Angeles. &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; reasoned the decline to Stern&#x27;s separation from his wife in late 1999 which made him &quot;considerably less intriguing&quot;.

In March 2001, Stern announced the departure of Martling, who was unable to reach an agreement over a new contract with WXRK. A &quot;Win Jackie&#x27;s Money&quot; contest began where comedians auditioned for Martling&#x27;s spot by sitting in on shows. Craig Gass, Doug Stanhope, Richard Jeni, Jim Florentine, A.J. Benza, and Ron Zimmerman were among the participants. In October, comedian and actor Artie Lange joined the show full-time.

Stern aired live during the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and continued to broadcast with most of his staff until around 12:15 pm. The live reporting was one of the first for those listening across the country, with callers sharing their own experiences. In September 2006, a 90-minute special featuring the staff and their recollections of the day aired on Howard TV, titled &quot;9.11.01: A Retrospective&quot;.

In September 2003, the FCC declared the show a &quot;bona fide news interview program&quot;, making it exempt from equal-time requirements placed for political candidates.

On February 27, 2004, John Melendez left the show to become the announcer on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Stern accused Leno of stealing his segments such as goofy red carpet interviews and booking Kenneth Keith Kallenbach, a member of the show&#x27;s Wack Pack. On March 17, a &quot;Win John&#x27;s Job&quot; contest was announced that allowed regular contributors and callers the opportunity to replace Melendez. Richard Christy, a former electrician and drummer of various death and heavy metal bands including Iced Earth and Death, won with 30% of the listener vote. Former stockbroker Sal Governale, the runner-up with 24%, was also hired in September.

On February 26, 2004, Stern was cancelled on six stations owned by Clear Channel Communications after a caller used the word &quot;nigger&quot; when asking Rick Salomon if he ever had sex with a black person the day before. Following the issue of a $495,000 fine to Clear Channel by the FCC, which cited sexual discussions on a show from 2003, Stern was removed permanently on the six stations. Stern returned to four of the six markets that he was suspended from, including five new ones, on Infinity-owned stations on July 19. The April 1, 2004 broadcast featured an April Fool&#x27;s Day prank where the show was supposedly cancelled and replaced with &quot;Cross and Lopez&quot;, a new show that promised &quot;fun without the filth&quot;.

On October 6, 2004, Stern announced his five-year contract with Sirius Satellite Radio, a subscription-based satellite radio service, free from the FCC&#x27;s regulations. A contributing factor in the decision was the aftermath of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy which began the tightening of censorship and regulation in broadcasting. The deal, worth approximately $100 million a year for all costs, included a bonus stock payment of $83 million for Stern in January 2007 for surpassing subscriber goals set in 2004. Promotion of Sirius met with controversy as Stern mentioned the service on air, instructing listeners in purchasing receivers and subscriptions. In one incident, Farid Suleman of Citadel Broadcasting billed Stern $200,000 for the continual advertising mentions. On November 8, 2005, Stern was suspended for one day for excessive promotion of the service; after moving to Sirius, Stern called the suspension a ploy by CBS to bolster its $500 million lawsuit against Stern in early 2006. CBS ultimately received 0.004% of the money it had sought. Sirius paid $2 million to CBS, and CBS relinquished full ownership of Stern&#x27;s 20-year archive of broadcast content to Sirius.

Stern hosted his final show on terrestrial radio on December 16, 2005. A stage was built outside the studio for Stern, his colleagues and Wack Pack members to make their farewell speeches. In his closing speech, Stern thanked the New York City Police Department, dedicating the show to Sergeant Keith Manning, a friend who at the time was serving in Iraq. When off the air, Stern traveled to the Hard Rock Cafe in Times Square on an open-top bus and met Martha Stewart, who was broadcasting on her own Sirius channel, Martha Stewart Living Radio. Stern&#x27;s contract with Infinity Broadcasting expired at midnight on December 31. The show was syndicated to as many as 60 markets across the United States and Canada, and gained a peak audience of 20 million listeners. In the New York market the show was the highest-rated morning program consecutively for seven years between 1994 and 2001. Stern&#x27;s successor in various East Coast affiliates, &quot;The David Lee Roth Show&quot;, attracted a market share of 1.8% in January 2006, which was down from 7.9% that Stern acquired a month previous. Stern was replaced with &quot;The Adam Carolla Show&quot; on numerous West Coast affiliates, and the still airing &quot;Rover&#x27;s Morning Glory&quot; in mostly Midwestern markets.

===2006‚Äìpresent: SiriusXM Radio===

&quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; made its debut broadcast on Sirius on January 9, 2006. The show began with &quot;Also sprach Zarathustra&quot; with added flatulence sound effects. George Takei then introduced himself as the show&#x27;s new announcer. 180,000 Sirius radios were activated a day before. Stern read out the list of revelations for the show&#x27;s &quot;Revelations Game&quot;, where staff told an unknown secret about themselves.

In May 2006, Stern claimed he had received offers from three major companies to return to terrestrial radio. Although he would never return, Stern did mention that it would be &quot;cool to go back and kick their asses.&quot; Although the names of the companies were never revealed, media organizations announced that Stern was considering a return. To clear up the rumors, the Associated Press were called on-air on May 10. &quot;The story is I wouldn&#x27;t do terrestrial radio for any reason&quot;, said Stern. Rumors once again arose in September 2006 that Stern would be returning, and were once again denied by Stern and Sirius. Sirius representative Patrick Reilly told United Press International that there were never &quot;any discussions of Howard Stern in any way, shape, or form being anything but exclusive to Sirius. Published reports suggesting otherwise are wrong.&quot;

Stern announced on June 7, 2006, that the lawsuit settlement with CBS Radio finally gave Sirius the exclusive rights to his entire back catalog of broadcasts from WXRK, totalling almost 23,000 hours. It was reported that Sirius agreed to pay CBS $2 million for the rights, equating to around $87 per-hour of tape. On December 2, 2009, it was announced that every tape had been digitized on a server taking up multiple terabytes of data.

After a suicide attempt in January 2010, Lange left the show.

On December 9, 2010, Stern announced the signing of a new five-year contract with Sirius XM which ended in December 2015. In September 2013, Howard TV&#x27;s contract was not renewed and the service ended.

On December 15, 2015, Stern announced he signed a new deal with SiriusXM to continue his radio show until December 2020. The agreement includes a 12-year deal giving SiriusXM the rights to his radio and video archives for an upcoming streaming video app tentatively called Howard 360.

In 2015 and 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; addressed changes in the show&#x27;s direction, with an emphasis on celebrity interviews and change in tone. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Scattered among the gleefully vulgar mainstays are now long, starkly intimate live exchanges‚Äîcharacter excavations that have made Mr. Stern one of the most deft and engrossing celebrity interviewers in the business and a sought-after stop for stars selling a movie or setting the record straight.&quot; Amongst the changes to the show, some Wack Pack members have been given less offensive names; Wendy the Retard was renamed Wendy the Slow Adult. During an interview with Madonna, Stern said of his earlier years in radio, &quot;I used to say bad things about everybody ... I was an angry young man.&quot; Former staff member Jackie Martling commented, &quot;Howard has become a lot of the things that he always told people not to become&quot;, while John Melendez said, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with change, but the old Howard would probably goof on the new Howard now.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; attributed Stern&#x27;s softening image to his chief operating officer, Marci Turk.

In October 2019, the show aired live from Los Angeles to commemorate the opening of a new SiriusXM studio. This marked the show&#x27;s first broadcasts outside New York City since 2004.

In June 2020, Stern faced criticism for a 1993 sketch from his &quot;New Year&#x27;s Rotten Eve Pageant&quot; special in which Stern parodied Ted Danson&#x27;s Friars Club appearance by wearing blackface and repeatedly using the N-word and other racial slurs. Addressing the renewed controversy, Stern stated: &quot;The shit I did was fucking crazy ... I&#x27;ll be the first to admit. I won&#x27;t go back and watch those old shows; it&#x27;s like, who is that guy. But that was my shtick, that&#x27;s what I did and I own it.&quot; Quivers and Stern both stated that both he and the show have &quot;evolved&quot; over the years.

In the summer of 2021, Stern spoke out strongly against Americans who refused to receive the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and called for mandatory vaccinations, saying &quot;When are we gonna stop putting up with the idiots in this country and just say it&#x27;s mandatory to get vaccinated? Fuck &#x27;em. Fuck their freedom&quot;. Stern also called for the firing of professional athletes who are misleading about their vaccination status, and mocked on his radio show other talk show hosts who spoke out against the vaccine and subsequently died from COVID-19.

In May 2023, the show aired from Miami to commemorate the opening of another new SiriusXM studio. This was the first time in 3 years the show broadcast from a studio since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

<text>The Triangle Program is an alternative education program in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who are at risk of dropping because of homophobic and transphobic harassment in regular schools or need supports and flexibility around struggles with mental health, housing, or other social struggles. 

Operated by the Toronto District School Board at the campus of Oasis Alternative Secondary School, Triangle is the only program of its type in Canada. It was created as an organization in 1995, and launched its first classes in 1996.

In conjunction with the LGBT youth organization Supporting Our Youth, Triangle also holds its own annual prom during Toronto&#x27;s Gay Pride Week.

The school day is divided into two halves. For the first half of the day students work on self-directed studies or smaller teacher-led classes. The afternoon is spent in a classroom setting, working on curriculum with a gay, lesbian and transgender focus. Units on LGBTQ history, healthy sexuality and equity and oppression allow gay, lesbian and transgender youth the opportunity to experience education geared to them.

<doc id="1092804" wikidata="Q2460379" url="?curid=1092804" title="Indefatigable-class battlecruiser">
<text>The &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class were the second class built of British battlecruisers which served in the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy during World War I. The design represented a modest reworking of the preceding , featuring increased endurance and an improved cross-deck arc of fire for their midships wing turrets achieved by a lengthening of the hull. Like its predecessor, the design resembled the contemporary dreadnought of the Royal Navy, but sacrificed armour protection and one turret from the main battery for a speed advantage.

Originally was the only ship of the class, but and were later built as part of a scheme to improve the defence of the Dominions by having each Dominion purchase a &#x27;fleet unit&#x27; of one battlecruiser, three light cruisers and six destroyers. Only Australia fully acceded to the idea, forming the Royal Australian Navy, but New Zealand agreed to fund one battlecruiser. A modified &quot;Indefatigable&quot; design was chosen rather than the then building for the Royal Navy.

They spent most of the war patrolling the North Sea, and participated in most of the battles there, although only &quot;New Zealand&quot; was in the United Kingdom when the war began. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was in the Mediterranean where she pursued the German warships and as they fled towards Turkey and &quot;Australia&quot; was flagship of the Royal Australian Navy in Australian waters where she helped to secure the German Pacific colonies and searched, unsuccessfully, for the German East Asia Squadron before sailing for the United Kingdom in December 1914. &quot;New Zealand&quot; participated in a number of the early actions in the North Sea including the Battle of Heligoland Bight and the inconclusive Scarborough Raid. &quot;Australia&quot; was still under repair after a collision with &quot;New Zealand&quot; before the Battle of Jutland so only &quot;Indefatigable&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; were present when the former was destroyed by a magazine explosion. Both &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; spent much uneventful time at sea after Jutland waiting for the next appearance of the High Seas Fleet, but that had been forbidden by the Kaiser. &quot;New Zealand&quot; conducted Admiral Jellicoe on his tour of India and the Dominions after the war while &quot;Australia&quot; returned home where she again became the flagship of the Royal Australian Navy. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was sold for scrap in 1922 while &quot;Australia&quot; only lasted two years more before being scuttled to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Background==
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was the successor to the &quot;Invincible&quot;-class battlecruisers. A number of options for large cruisers were considered for the 1906 Naval Programme, including the X4 design of with armour and speed, but in the end this programme consisted only of three ships of the type. A number of options were considered for the 1907‚Äì08 programme, ranging from to , but in the end battleships were again favoured and no battlecruisers were ordered until the subsequent programme year.

At the time the final design of &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was approved, the Admiralty was already moving on, Fisher writing in September 1908 &quot;I&#x27;ve got Sir Philip Watts into a new &quot;Indomitable&quot; that will make your mouth water when you see it&quot;, a design that was to eventually emerge as . In August 1909 the self-governing dominions met at the 1909 Imperial Conference, and in discussion of Imperial defence, the Admiralty proposed the creation of indigenous fleet units, each to consist of one &quot;Invincible&quot;-class battlecruiser, three light cruisers of the &quot;Bristol&quot; class, and six destroyers. These were to be based in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa in attempt to secure the naval defence of the Dominions while the Royal Navy concentrated in home waters to meet the German threat. While the scheme was rejected by Canada and South Africa, Australia and New Zealand subscribed, each ordering a modified version of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, rather than the originally proposed &quot;Invincible&quot; class. &quot;Australia&quot; became a ship of the newly formed Royal Australian Navy, while &quot;New Zealand&quot; was retained in European waters as a wholly RN unit. Eventually, only one fleet unit was formed, the Australian squadron in 1913.

The was ordered as the lone battlecruiser of the 1908‚Äì9 programme. Her outline design was prepared in March 1908, and the final design was approved in November 1908. This design was essentially an enlarged with revised arrangements of protection and main armament.

===General characteristics===
The &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s were slightly larger than their predecessors of the . They had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. They displaced at load and at deep load, over more than the earlier ships. They had a metacentric height of at deep load.

===Propulsion===
Each paired set of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines was housed in a separate engine-room and drove two shafts. The wing shaft was coupled to the high-pressure ahead and astern turbines and the low-pressure turbines to the inner shafts. Each wing shaft drove a propeller in diameter and the propellers on the inner shafts were in diameter. The turbines were powered by thirty-one Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers in five boiler rooms. &quot;Indefatigable&quot;‚Ä≥s turbines were designed to produce a total of , but reached over on forced draught during trials in 1911. The turbines of &quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; were slightly more powerful at . They were designed for , but all three bettered during trials.

The ships carried approximately of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, the ships could steam for at a speed of .

===Armament===
Each ship carried eight BL Mk X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; respectively. Two wing turrets were mounted amidships &quot;en echelon&quot; between the funnels, identified as &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27;. &#x27;P&#x27; turret was mounted on the port side and normally faced forward, &#x27;Q&#x27; turret was mounted on the starboard side and normally faced aft (rearwards). &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;Q&#x27; turrets were staggered‚Äî&#x27;P&#x27; was forward of &#x27;Q&#x27;, enabling &#x27;P&#x27; to fire in a 70¬∞ arc to the starboard side and &#x27;Q&#x27; to likewise fire towards the port side. These were the same guns as those mounted in , the and .

The guns could initially be depressed to ‚àí3¬∞ and elevated to 13.5¬∞, although the turrets were modified to allow 16¬∞ of elevation during World War I. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 13.5¬∞, this provided a maximum range of with armour-piercing (AP) 2 crh shells. At 16¬∞ elevation, the range was extended to using the more aerodynamic, but slightly heavier 4 crh AP shells. The rate of fire of these guns was 1‚Äì2 rounds per minute. The ships carried a total of 880 rounds during wartime for 110 shells per gun.

The secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure. All of the guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during refits in 1914 and 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two guns were removed at the same time. The guns on their PII* mounts had a maximum depression of 7¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 15¬∞. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; this gave a maximum range of . Their rate of fire was 6‚Äì8 rounds per minute. They were provided with 100 rounds per gun.

An additional 4-inch gun was fitted in the surviving ships during 1917 as an anti-aircraft (AA) gun. It was mounted on a Mark II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60¬∞. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only . Earlier anti-aircraft guns included a single QF 20 cwt AA gun on a high-angle Mark II mount that was added during refits in 1914‚Äì15. This had a maximum depression of 10¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 90¬∞. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12‚Äì14 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of . It was provided with 500 rounds. &quot;New Zealand&quot; carried a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss AA gun on a HA MkIc mounting from October 1914 to the end of 1915. This had a maximum depression of 8¬∞ and a maximum elevation of 60¬∞. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 20 rounds per minute. It had a maximum ceiling of , but an effective range of only .

They mounted two 17.7-inch (450-mm) submerged torpedo tubes, one on each side aft of &#x27;X&#x27; barbette, for which twelve torpedoes were carried.

===Fire control===

The spotting tops, a modern equivalent of the sailing ship&#x27;s fighting top, at the head of the tripod fore and main masts controlled the fire of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;‚Ä≥s main guns. Data from a Barr and Stroud rangefinder was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to Vickers range clocks located in the Transmitting Station (TS) located beneath each spotting top where it was converted into range and deflection data for use by the guns. The target&#x27;s data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. Each gun turret had its own transmission equipment and the turrets, Transmitting Stations, and spotting tops could be connected in almost any combination. Firing trials against in 1907 revealed this system&#x27;s vulnerability to gunfire as the spotting top was hit twice and a large splinter severed the voice pipe and all wiring running along the mast. To guard against this possibility &#x27;A&#x27; turret of &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was fitted with a 9-foot rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof and it was equipped to control the entire main armament during a refit between 1911 and 1914.

&quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; were built with a different arrangement. The spotting top on the main mast was deleted and an armoured spotting tower was built instead into the conning tower where it was better protected, had an improved field of vision and direct access to the primary conning position. The rear Transmitting Station was also deleted and the forward TS was consequently enlarged. Their &#x27;A&#x27; turrets were built with the improvements listed above.

Fire control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding World War I and the development of the Dreyer Fire Control Table was one such advance. It combined the functions of the Dumaresq and the range clock and a simplified version, the Mk I, was fitted to the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s during refits in 1915‚Äì16. The more important development was the director firing system. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically transmitted training and elevation angles to the gun turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen had only to follow. The director layer&#x27;s trigger fired the guns simultaneously which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimized the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells. A gun within the &#x27;Y&#x27; turret was also equipped with transmitters so that, as a backup, it could function as a &quot;directing gun&quot;, but there was no provision for the gun battery to be split between the main director and this directing gun. The &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s received their director equipment between mid-1915 and May 1916.

===Armour===
In some ways the armour protection given to the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s was weaker than that of their predecessors as the armour was reduced in thickness in a number of places, but it was spread out to a greater extent. &quot;Indefatigable&#x27;s&quot; main belt ran from stem to stern; it was thick for the middle of the ship, but was reduced to abreast the end 12-inch gun barbettes and magazines and thinned still further to at the ends of the ship. A bulkhead met the barbette of X turret while the forward bulkhead was in thickness. The gun turrets and barbettes were protected by of armour, except for the turret roofs which used of Krupp non-cemented armour (KNC). The supporting beams for the turret roofs were reinforced over those of the &quot;Invincibles&quot; based on lessons learned in firing trials conducted during 1907. The thickness of the main deck was generally of nickel steel, but increased to around the base of the barbettes. The lower deck armour of nickel steel was on the flat and 2¬†inches thick on the slope, but increased to two inches at the ship&#x27;s ends. The sides of the forward conning tower were thick while the spotting tower had four inches. The roof and floor of both towers were KNC armour 3¬†inches thick while the conning tower&#x27;s communication tube was four inches of KNC. The torpedo director tower is 1¬†inch of nickel steel all around. Nickel steel torpedo bulkheads of 2.5-inch thickness were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. The funnel uptakes were protected with 1.5¬†inches of nickel steel on the sides and 1¬†inch on the ends. Krupp cemented armour was used throughout, unless otherwise mentioned.

&quot;Australia&quot; and &quot;New Zealand&quot; were built with a different arrangement. The waterline belt did not extend to the ends, but terminated short of the bow and short of the stern. The sections abreast the barbettes were thickened to and the sections at each end were increased to four inches. The main deck armour was increased to 2.5¬†inches around the barbettes and was extended 55 feet past the rear barbette. The lower deck armour was decreased from 1.5‚Äì2¬†inches to one inch, both on the flat and slope, except at the ends where it was thickened to 2.5¬†inches. After Jutland one inch of armour was added to the magazine crowns and the turret roofs with a total weight of .

==Construction==
The following table gives the build details and purchase cost of the members of the &quot;Indefatigable&quot; class. Whilst standard British practice at that time was for these costs to exclude armament and stores, for some reason the cost quoted in The Naval Annual for &quot;Indefatigable&quot; includes the armament.
* = estimated cost, including guns

==Service history==
&quot;Indefatigable&quot; was initially assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet upon her commissioning in 1911. She was transferred to the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean Fleet in December 1913. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was only briefly assigned to the Home Fleet before she sailed for New Zealand in February 1912. She returned to Portsmouth the following December and was assigned again to the Home Fleet. She made a number of port visits to France and Russia before the war began. &quot;Australia&quot; set sail for Australia almost immediately after she was commissioned in June 1913 to assume her duties as the first flagship of the Royal Australian Navy.

===Pursuit of &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;===

&quot;Indefatigable&quot;, accompanied by , under the command of Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne, encountered the German battlecruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and the light cruiser &quot;Breslau&quot; on the morning of 4 August 1914 headed east after a cursory bombardment of the French Algerian port of Philippeville, but Britain and Germany were not yet at war so Milne turned to shadow the Germans as they headed back to Messina to recoal. All three battlecruisers had problems with their boilers, but &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot; were able to break contact and reached Messina by the morning of the 5th. By this time war had been declared, after the German invasion of Belgium, but an Admiralty order to respect Italian neutrality and stay outside a six-mile (10¬†km) limit from the Italian coast precluded entrance into the passage of the Strait of Messina where they could observe the port directly. Milne therefore stationed and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; at the northern exit of the Straits of Messina, still expecting the Germans to break out to the west where they could attack French troop transports; he stationed the light cruiser at the southern exit and sent &quot;Indomitable&quot; to recoal at Bizerte, where she was better positioned to react to a German sortie into the Western Mediterranean.

The Germans sortied from Messina on 6 August and headed east, towards Constantinople, trailed by &quot;Gloucester&quot;. Milne, still expecting Rear Admiral Wilhelm Souchon to turn west, kept the battlecruisers at Malta until shortly after midnight on 8 August, when he set sail for Cape Matapan, where &quot;Goeben&quot; had been spotted eight hours earlier, at a leisurely . At 14:30 he received an incorrect signal from the Admiralty stating that Britain was at war with Austria ‚Äî war would not be declared until 12 August and the order was countermanded four hours later, but Milne followed his standing orders to guard the Adriatic against an Austrian breakout attempt, rather than seek &quot;Goeben&quot;. Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to &quot;chase &quot;Goeben&quot; which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north-east.&quot; Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles, and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean, unaware that the &quot;Goeben&quot; did not intend to come out.

On 3 November Churchill ordered the first British attack on the Dardanelles following the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack was carried out by &quot;Indomitable&quot; and &quot;Indefatigable&quot;, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships and . The intention of the attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr at the tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which did not happen until 6 November. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; remained in the Mediterranean until she was relieved by &quot;Inflexible&quot; on 24 January 1915 and proceeded to Malta to refit. Having completed her refit she sailed to England on 14 February where she joined the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (BCS) upon her arrival.

===&quot;Australia&quot; in the Pacific===

Following the declaration of war, &quot;Australia&quot; was assigned to find the German East Asia Squadron, the only Central Powers naval force of note in the Pacific. During this hunt, she was attached to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force and provided support during the Force&#x27;s invasion of Rabaul, in case the German squadron was present. The squadron&#x27;s commander, Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee, was wary of &quot;Australia&quot;, which he described as being superior to his squadron.

Following von Spee&#x27;s withdrawal from the Pacific, &quot;Australia&quot; was belatedly ordered on 8 November 1914 to join with several Japanese cruisers off Mexico to resume the hunt for the German cruisers. By this time, the German squadron had made its way to the South Atlantic, and in early December was destroyed by a British squadron in the Battle of the Falkland Islands. &quot;Australia&quot; was sent to join the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron at Rosyth, Scotland, and was made flagship of the squadron after a short refit.

===Battle of Heligoland Bight===

&quot;New Zealand&quot;‚Ä≥s first action was as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral Beatty during the Battle of Heligoland Bight operation on 28 August 1914. Beatty&#x27;s ships had originally been intended as distant support of the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks. They turned south at full speed at 11:35 AM when the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule and the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the bar at the mouth of the Jade estuary. The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the light cruisers and when Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. &quot;Strassburg&quot; was able to duck into the mists and evade fire, but &quot;C√∂ln&quot; remained visible and was quickly crippled by fire from the squadron. But Beatty was distracted from the task of finishing her off by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser directly to his front. He turned in pursuit, but reduced her to a flaming hulk in only three salvos at a range under . At 13:10 Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Shortly after turning north, Beatty&#x27;s main body encountered the crippled &quot;C√∂ln&quot; and she was sunk by two salvos from .

===Raid on Scarborough===

The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would actually conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. But what the Germans did not know was that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, now reduced to four ships, including &quot;New Zealand&quot;, as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.

Admiral Hipper set sail on 15 December 1914 for another such raid and successfully bombarded several English towns, but British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 5:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender, commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 05:40 that was engaging enemy destroyers although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the German armoured cruiser and her escorts at about 07:00, but could not transmit the message until 7:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did &quot;New Zealand&quot;, but Beatty did not, despite the fact that &quot;New Zealand&quot; had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and Beatty. Warrender attempted to pass on Shark&#x27;s message to Beatty at 07:36, but did not manage to make contact until 07:55. Beatty reversed course when he got the message and dispatched &quot;New Zealand&quot; to search for &quot;Roon&quot;. She was being overhauled by &quot;New Zealand&quot; when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered &quot;New Zealand&quot; to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.
The British forces split going around the shallow Southwest Patch of the Dogger Bank; Beatty&#x27;s ships passed to the north while Warrender passed to the south as they headed west to block the main route through the minefields defending the English coast. This left a gap between them through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II¬†Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30 Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper&#x27;s ships, however, those were some 50¬†km¬†(31¬†mi) behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty&#x27;s ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.

===Battle of Dogger Bank===

On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. But the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty, which included &quot;New Zealand&quot;. Contact was initiated at 07:20 on the 24th when the British light cruiser &quot;Arethusa&quot; spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35 the Germans had spotted Beatty&#x27;s force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing that this would suffice if the ships that he saw to his northwest were British battleships and that he could always increased speed to &#x27;s maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.

Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. &quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; were the slowest of Beatty&#x27;s ships and gradually fell behind the newer and faster battlecruisers, but &quot;New Zealand&quot; was able to open fire on &quot;Bl√ºcher&quot; by 09:35. She continued to engage &quot;Bl√ºcher&quot; after the other, faster, battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour &quot;New Zealand&quot; had knocked out &quot;Bl√ºcher&quot;‚Ä≥s forward turret and &quot;Indomitable&quot; began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced her armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room at 10:35. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port turrets and the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed had dropped to and her steering gear jammed. At 10:48 Beatty ordered &quot;Indomitable&quot; to attack her. But due to a combination of a mistake by Beatty&#x27;s flag lieutenant in signalling and heavy damage to Beatty&#x27;s flagship , which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards so that Beatty could not communicate with his ships that caused the rest of the battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in &quot;New Zealand&quot;, to believe that that signal applied to them. So they turned away from Hipper&#x27;s main body and engaged &quot;Bl√ºcher&quot;. &quot;New Zealand&quot; fired 147 shells at &quot;Bl√ºcher&quot; before she capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed.

===Battle of Jutland===

On 31 May 1916 the 2nd BCS consisted of &quot;New Zealand&quot; (Flagship of Rear Admiral William Christopher Pakenham) and &quot;Indefatigable&quot; as &quot;Australia&quot; was still under repair following her collision with &quot;New Zealand&quot; on 22 April. It was assigned to Admiral Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty&#x27;s ships did not spot the Germans to their east until 14:30. Almost immediately afterwards, at 15:32, he ordered a course change to east south-east to position himself astride the German&#x27;s line of retreat and called his ships&#x27; crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still far too north to cut off Hipper.

This began what was to be called the &#x27;Run to the South&#x27; as Beatty changed course to steer east south-east at 3:45, paralleling Hipper&#x27;s course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed almost immediately afterwards by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, and had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with &quot;Indefatigable&quot; in the rear and the furthest to the west, and &quot;New Zealand&quot; ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. &quot;Indefatigable&quot; aimed at while &quot;New Zealand&quot; aimed at while remaining unengaged herself. By 15:54 the range was down to and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. Around 16:00 &quot;Indefatigable&quot; was hit by two or three shells from &quot;Von der Tann&quot; around the rear turret and almost immediately fell off to starboard and was down by the stern and listing to port. She was hit twice more on the next volley, once on forecastle and on the forward turret, and blew up at about 16:03 when her magazines exploded. The most likely cause of her loss was a low-order explosion in &#x27;X&#x27; magazine that blew out her bottom and severed the control shafts between the steering engines and the steering gear, followed by the explosion of her forward magazines from the second volley. &quot;Von der Tann&quot; fired only 52 shells at &quot;Indefatigable&quot; before she exploded, taking 1017 men with her. The only two survivors were rescued by the German torpedo boat .
After &quot;Indefatigable&quot;‚Ä≥s loss &quot;New Zealand&quot; shifted her fire to &quot;Von der Tann&quot; in accordance with Beatty&#x27;s standing instructions. The range had grown too far for accurate shooting so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. By this time the 5th Battle Squadron of four s had close up and was engaging &quot;Von der Tann&quot; and &quot;Moltke&quot;. At 16:23 a shell from hit near &quot;Von der Tann&quot;‚Ä≥s rear turret and started a fire among the practice targets stowed there that completely enveloped the ship and caused &quot;New Zealand&quot; to shift fire to &quot;Moltke&quot;. At 16:30 the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty&#x27;s ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer&#x27;s battleships, but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen-point turn to starboard in succession. &quot;New Zealand&quot;, last ship in the fleet, turned prematurely to stay outside the range of the oncoming battleships. During the entire &#x27;Run to the South&#x27; she was hit only once, in &#x27;Y&#x27; turret by a 28¬†cm shell with little effect.

&quot;New Zealand&quot; was engaged by the battleship beginning at 17:08 during what came to be called the &#x27;Run to the North&#x27;, but she was not hit, although she was straddled several times. Beatty&#x27;s ships maintained full speed to try to put some separation between them and the High Seas Fleet and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then northeast to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet. At 17:40 they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the northeast at 17:47. Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet into its battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 18:35 Beatty was following &quot;Indomitable&quot; and of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-southeast, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to their southwest. A few minutes earlier Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180¬∞ starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze. Twenty minutes later Scheer ordered another 180¬∞ turn which put them on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet, which had altered course itself to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer&#x27;s T and they badly damaged his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180¬∞ turn at 19:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap in which he had sent them.

This was successful and the British lost sight of the Germans until 20:05 when spotted smoke bearing west-northwest. Ten minutes later she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing the sounds of gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. &quot;Inflexible&quot; opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers. &quot;New Zealand&quot; and &quot;Indomitable&quot; concentrated their fire on and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage. Shortly after 20:30 the pre-dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve&#x27;s II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans only were able to fire a few rounds at them due to the poor visibility and turned away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 20:40. After this Beatty changed course to south-southeast and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning when the order was given to reverse course.

===Post-Jutland careers===

&quot;Australia&quot; rejoined the 2nd BCS on 9 June 1916 as the squadron flagship, but there was little significant naval activity for the &quot;Indefatigable&quot;s, other than routine patrolling, thanks to the Kaiser&#x27;s order that his ships should not be allowed to go to sea unless assured of victory. &quot;Australia&quot; collided with on 12 December 1917 and was under repair through the following month. She was present at the internment of the High Seas fleet at Scapa Flow on 21 November 1918. &quot;New Zealand&quot; was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for Admiral Jellicoe&#x27;s year-long tour of India and the Dominions and she was paid off upon her return on 15 March 1920 into reserve. She was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922. &quot;Australia&quot; sailed for Australia on 23 April 1921 and became flagship of the Royal Australian Navy upon her arrival. Pursuant to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty she was scuttled east of Sydney on 12 April 1924.

<text>The Quarantine Speech was a speech given by U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in Chicago on October 5, 1937. The speech called for an international &quot;quarantine&quot; against the &quot;epidemic of world lawlessness&quot; by aggressive nations as an alternative to the political climate of American neutrality and non-intervention that was prevalent at the time. No countries were directly mentioned in the speech, although it was interpreted as referring to the Empire of Japan, the Kingdom of Italy, and Nazi Germany. Roosevelt suggested the use of economic pressure, a forceful response, but less direct than outright aggression. The speech was given at the dedication of the Outer Drive Bridge between north and south outer Lake Shore Drive. The speech received backlash for its interventionist ideals, causing protest from non-interventionists and heightening America&#x27;s isolationist sentiments.

Public response to the speech was mixed. Famed cartoonist Percy Crosby, creator of Skippy (comic strip) and very outspoken Roosevelt critic, bought a two-page advertisement in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; to attack it. In addition, it was heavily criticized by Hearst-owned newspapers and Robert R. McCormick of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, but several subsequent compendia of editorials showed overall approval in US media.

Roosevelt realized the impact that those writing in favor of isolationism had on the nation. He hoped that the storm isolationists had created would fade away and allow the general public to become educated and even active in international policy. However, this was not the response that grew over time, with the controversy eventually intensifying isolationism views in more Americans. Roosevelt even mentioned in two personal letters written on October 16, 1937, that &quot;he was &#x27;fighting against a public psychology which comes very close to saying &#x27;peace at any price.&#x27;&quot; Disappointed in how the public reacted to the speech, Roosevelt decided to take a step back with regards to his foreign policy, even to the point of accepting an apology from Japan after the sinking of the USS Panay.

In 1875, the company began the world&#x27;s first newspaper delivery service.

In 1911, the paper merged with &quot;Osaka Mainichi Shimbun&quot; (Â§ßÈò™ÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû, lit. &quot;Osaka Daily News&quot;) to form the &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; (ÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû, lit. &quot;Daily News&quot;) company. The two newspapers continued to print independently until 1943, when both editions were placed under a &quot;Mainichi Shimbun&quot; masthead.

<text>Slaight Communications is a Canadian radio broadcasting company. The company was formed as Slaight Broadcasting in 1971, when owner J. Allan Slaight acquired CFGM in Richmond Hill. Slaight later also acquired CFOX in Montreal and CHOK in Sarnia, and launched CILQ in Toronto.

The company later sold off all of its original assets, and continued to operate its radio holdings through the Standard Broadcasting division after Slaight bought out that company in 1985. As Standard, it remained the largest privately owned multimedia company in Canada until it sold its radio and TV broadcasting assets to Astral Media in 2007. Today, all of Standard Radio stations are either owned by Bell Media or Stingray Radio.

The company continues to operate holdings in non-traditional broadcast platforms such as satellite radio and Internet radio. Slaight also continues to hold minority investments in three other small radio station groups.

==Standard Broadcasting==

Standard Broadcasting was founded as Standard Radio Manufacturing in 1925 by Edward S. Rogers, Sr., but soon became known as Rogers Vacuum Tube Company and later became the Rogers Majestic Corporation Limited.
Rogers launched what would become radio station CFRB in 1927 in order to demonstrate a batteryless alternating current radio receiver he had invented.

In 1929 Standard Radio Manufacturing Corporation was renamed as Rogers Majestic Corporation Limited

The broadcasting division of the company was renamed Standard Radio Limited in 1941 when the Rogers family sold off the assets of Rogers Majestic two years after the death of Edward Rogers. The Rogers family would later re-enter the broadcasting business in 1960 in a form of Aldred-Rogers Broadcasting, the company founded by Edward&#x27;s son, Ted Rogers, which later became Rogers Communications.

In 1945, Standard Radio was purchased by Argus Corporation and in 1966 Standard Radio Limited was renamed Standard Broadcasting. Argus was acquired by Conrad Black and his brother in 1978. Argus subsequently sold Standard to Slaight in 1985 and merged into Slaight Broadcasting.

==Merged operations==

As Standard, the company under Slaight operated 82 radio stations in English Canada and two television stations in northern British Columbia. It also owned a significant minority interest in the radio station operators Milestone Radio, Haliburton Broadcasting Group and 3937844 Canada Inc. in Canada, and Martz Communications Group in the US. The company also operated divisions in e-commerce, videotape and DVD distribution, retail marketing and audio and video post-production, and was the primary shareholder in the satellite radio provider Sirius Canada.

In 2006, the company announced an initial public offering via an income trust; these plans were later cancelled due to &quot;market conditions&quot;. On February 23, 2007, Astral Media announced that it had signed a letter of intent and had entered into exclusive negotiations regarding the acquisition of &quot;substantially all of the assets&quot; of Standard. A formal agreement was later announced, with the proposed transaction being approved by the CRTC on September 28, 2007. Astral would eventually be taken over by Bell Media on July 5, 2013.

Astral did not acquire Standard&#x27;s Internet and satellite radio assets, nor its minority interests in various other radio stations. The transaction was finalized on October 29, 2007, and Standard changed its name to Slaight Communications the following day.

==Current assets==

After selling its Standard Radio assets to Astral Media in October 2007, Slaight Communications remained the owner and operator of Internet radio portal Iceberg Radio, which was subsequently also sold to Astral in a separate transaction. The company is still a partner, along with Canadian Satellite Radio Holdings, Sirius XM Radio and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in Sirius XM Canada.

The company also retained its minority shares in the Haliburton, Milestone and Martz radio groups, although all three groups have since sold off many or all of their assets as well.

Standard&#x27;s minority share in 3937844 Canada was also not transferred to Astral, but was wholly acquired by its majority owner, Newcap Broadcasting, in a separate transaction which also took place in 2007.

In 2010, the company invested in Mediazoic, a webcasting software project.

Slaight Communications owns a 7.19% stake in Fight Holdings, a minority partner in Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment.

<text>Carl Wilhelm Hahn (Lat. &quot;Carolus Guilielmus Hahn&quot;, 16 December 1786 ‚Äì 7 November 1835) was a German zoologist and author of the first German monograph on spiders. C. W. Hahn was an all-round natural scientist ‚Äì not at all unusual for his time. Surprisingly, he seems to have been almost forgotten. Even the few biographical dates that have been published in secondary literature are not always correct as clarified by P. Sacher in his &quot;attempt at a Biography&quot;.

== Life and lifework ==

Carl Wilhelm Christian Hahn was born in Weingartsgreuth, Upper Franconia, as the first son of Johann Michael Hahn (1734‚Äì1824), who was court and palace gardener on the estate of Baron von Seckendorff, later palace gardener for Count Friedrich von P√ºckler. He obeyed the general call to arms as early as 1813, and served as a quartermaster, and in 1816, received his honourable discharge. Afterwards, he lived with his parents in F√ºrth, and according to Hahn, made up his mind to devote his life to his predilection for natural history, an interest he had possessed since early childhood and which intensified during his studies in Erlangen. He commenced work on his first ornithological work, &quot;Birds from Asia, Africa, America and New Holland&quot;. When his &quot;often promised and well earned position&quot; failed to materialize, Hahn undertook what was for that time, in his field, a very unusual step and went freelance. From then on, he called himself a natural historian and occasionally also a scholar. On 24 February 1820, having in the meantime qualified as a Dr. Phil. at the University of Erlangen, he married Victoria Francisca Kaltdorff, n√©e Schaefer. His wife, the widow of a doctor of medicine, was about five years older than he, and had three children by her previous marriage. She was at this time without means, but was expecting quite large inheritance from her maternal uncle before long. Their own child, Anna Friedericke, was born at the end of 1820 or 1821.

Hahn is assumed to have been in close contact with the universally known natural scientist Jakob Sturm, and probably with his two sons. He named a spider species after Jakob: &quot;Araneus Sturmii&quot;, now &quot;Atea sturmi&quot; (). His relationship with Johann Georg Wagler must have been similarly close. He also named a spider species after him: &quot;L√øcosa Waglerii&quot;, now &quot;Pardosa wagleri&quot; (). Nothing reliable is known about other contacts within the remarkably productive Nuremberg zoologist scene, nor does any proof exist that Hahn knew Franz von Paula (von) Schrank personally, a highly regarded natural scientist, to whom he dedicated the &quot;Monograph on Spiders&quot;. The scientific value of Hahn&#x27;s lifework in natural history varies. His ornithological work, for example, never had any discernible influence on this field. Hahn&#x27;s work on the true bugs (Heteroptera), though, is just as important as his works on spiders (Araneae). One species of bug even carries his name: &quot;Lopus hahni&quot; . He was also given this honour in the field of arachnology: Carl Ludwig Koch, who continued &quot;Die Arachniden&quot; after Hahn&#x27;s death, called a genus after him in 1841 (&quot;Hahnia&quot;), on which later the name of the whole family was based ‚Äì Hahniidae .

Hahn died in Nuremberg on 7 November 1835, &quot;of a lung complaint in the prime of life&quot;.

=== &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot; ‚Äì Monograph on Spiders ===

About the rarity of the work - today, only about 14 ‚Äì partially incomplete ‚Äì copies are known. They were recorded and examined by Sacher from Germany (Wittenberg, Berlin, Jena, Darmstadt, Erlangen, Kiel, Munich, Frankfurt/M.), England (London), U.S.A. (Cambridge/Mass.), Austria (Vienna), and France (Paris). &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot; has become a rarity already at the beginning of the 20th century. This rarity is because only small editions were produced: &quot;More than a hundred copies of each installment will not be produced.&quot;, remarked Hahn on this subject in 1820. The great rarity of complete copies probably results primarily from the long gap between installments. Ascertaining whether Hahn broke with his publisher or Lechner with him has not been possible, but a separation took place some time before the publication of the sixth installment. Indeed, in 1831, the first installment of &quot;&quot;Die Arachniden&quot; had already appeared in Zeh&#x27;s Bookshop in Nuremberg as an obvious substitute for the &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot;. It was more accessible, thus also better known than the &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot;. In the sixth installment of the &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot;&quot;, publisher Lechner 1831 inserted a small-format &quot;message&quot;, which announced that Hahn had been relieved as editor. Probably the contents of the sixth installment still can be wholly attributed to Hahn, though he had only admitted to the first five installments. For obvious reasons, Lechner was not in a position to print anything new, though he still had original drawings in his possession, which he published without Hahn&#x27;s consent. For this reason alone, competing with Hahn&#x27;s new project was already impossible. So not surprisingly, the promised ninth installment failed to appear.

In the past, some confusion arose regarding the year of publication, particularly of the installments 2, 5, and 7, probably caused both by the partial absence of dated forewords and of dust jackets for the individual installments, as by the fact, that the bookshop and later (1822) publisher, Lechner did not only provide installments that were sold later with a nonoriginal cover, but in a good many cases also overwrote the year of publication with the year of sale. On basis of recent investigation, the correlation between installments and the years of publication has been clarified as:

A definitive representative copy of &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot; probably does not exist (any more). The available copies differ in several features as detailed pointed out by Sacher. For this reason, it was used a combined version for the reprint of 1988.

&quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot;, though, is far more than just a bibliophilic work.

Firstly, it includes nine still-valid first descriptions of spider species. In the 19th century not unusually, a majority of &quot;new species&quot; had been previously described by other authors, because in contrast to the modern differentiation of species, the genital structures were not taken into consideration at that time. For that reason, smaller differences in the colourings and markings have possibly given rise to different species designations. At any rate, a sixth of the forms described by Hahn are still valid today. That Hahn was a good observer and gave exact descriptions is shown clearly by the example of &quot;Eresus annulatus&quot; (= &quot;E. sandaliatus&quot; () and &quot;E. cinnaberinus&quot; (= &quot;E. kollari&quot; ). After more than 150 years, arachnologists follow his separation of these taxa today again.

Secondly, its monographic character is remarkable. It is the first monographic work for spiders in the German language. Further, 180 years ago, using a group such as spiders as a sole subject of a book was very unusual. Apart from a natural history of spiders by Frenchman &lt;Walckenaer in 1806, no work of that time has exclusively had spiders as its subject.

Thirdly, spider illustrations in the &quot;&quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot; show Hahn to be an above-average artist and lithographer.

Finally, &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot; and &quot;Die Arachniden&quot; are different ways of carrying out the same project and they can both be considered as autonomous works, whereas Brignoli ‚Äì an important cataloguer in arachnology ‚Äì regarded &quot;Monographie der Spinnen&quot; only as a sort of blueprint for &quot;Die Arachniden&quot;&quot;.

===&quot; Die Arachniden&quot; ===

Until the end of the 18th century, all studies of spiders, scorpions, and related forms were treated as part of the wider study of entomology, for these were described as wingless insects and included in one genus, the &quot;Aranea&quot; of Linnaeus, of perhaps 500 different species. Based on Walckenaer&#x27;s &quot;Fauna Parisienne&quot; (1802) Latreille established the first set of genera for spiders in his work, which is marking the real beginning of arachnological systematics, and which was extended by Walckenaer into the important &quot;Histoire naturelle des Insectes Apt√®res&quot; (1837‚Äì1847). During the mid-19th century, the centre of activity shifted away from France to Germany. An important part of this shift was due to the 14-volume work of Hahn and C. L. Koch, &quot;&quot;Die Arachniden&quot; (1831‚Äì1848). In contrast to the French manuscripts with their terse descriptions and infrequent illustrations, the 2000-plus pages of beautifully coloured plates of this work captured the attention of zoologists everywhere. French arachnologist Simon was incited by the high number of species, described from Germany in &quot;Die Arachniden&quot;, while from his native France almost nothing had been done. In particular, &quot;Die Arachniden&quot;&quot; was very influential in founding a German tradition of active interest in arachnology, which flourished for nearly a century. Its major shortcoming, as was realized later, was the lack of a natural scheme of classification, particularly above the family level.

<text>Andrew Kennedy Irvine (born 14 June 1942), known professionally as Andy Irvine, is an Irish folk musician, singer-songwriter, and a founding member of Sweeney&#x27;s Men, Planxty, Patrick Street, Mozaik, LAPD and Usher&#x27;s Island. He also featured in duos, with D√≥nal Lunny, Paul Brady, Mick Hanly, Dick Gaughan, Rens van der Zalm, and Luke Plumb. Irvine plays the mandolin, mandola, bouzouki, harmonica, and hurdy-gurdy.

He has been influential in folk music for over six decades, during which he recorded a large repertoire of songs and tunes he assembled from books, old recordings and rooted in the Irish, English, Scottish, Eastern European, Australian and American old-time and folk traditions.

As a child actor, Irvine honed his performing talent from an early age and learned the classical guitar. He switched to folk music after discovering Woody Guthrie, also adopting the latter&#x27;s other instruments: harmonica and mandolin. While extending Guthrie&#x27;s guitar picking technique to the mandolin, he further developed his playing of this instrument‚Äîand, later, of the mandola and the bouzouki‚Äîinto a decorative, harmonic style, and embraced the modes and rhythms of Bulgarian folk music.

Along with Johnny Moynihan and D√≥nal Lunny, Irvine is one of the pioneers who adapted the Greek bouzouki‚Äîwith a new tuning‚Äîinto the Irish bouzouki. He contributed to advancing the design of his instruments in co-operation with English luthier Stefan Sobell, and he sometimes plays a hurdy-gurdy made for him in 1972 by Peter Abnett, another English luthier.

Although touring mainly as a soloist, Irvine has also enjoyed great success in pursuing collaborations through many projects that have influenced contemporary folk music. He continues to tour and has performed extensively in Ireland, Great Britain, Europe, North and South America, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. In October 2018, he received the first Lifetime Achievement Award bestowed at RT√â Radio 1&#x27;s inaugural Folk Music Awards.
==Early life and acting career==
Andy Irvine was born in St John&#x27;s Wood, northwest London on 14 June 1942. His mother, Felicia Madge Lessels, was from Wallasey, Merseyside, and his father, Archibald Kennedy Irvine, from Glasgow. His mother had been a musical comedy actress who performed under the stage name of Felice Lascelles, and Irvine would later say that &quot;she may have given up the stage, but she never stopped acting!&quot;. At the age of three-and-a-half, Irvine started attending boarding school, where he would later play football during the winter season, rugby during the spring season, and cricket during the summer season, all of which fostered his lifelong passion for team sports.

As a child, Irvine was given opportunities to appear on stage, TV and in films. In the summer holidays of 1950, when he was eight years old, his first role was to play Jimmy in the film &quot;A Tale of Five Cities&quot; (released as &quot;A Tale of Five Women&quot; in the US). At thirteen, he starred as Nokie (short for Pinocchio) in the ITV children&#x27;s series &quot;Round at the Redways&quot; and joined a school for child actors. He made his stage debut in the Grand Theatre in Wolverhampton and, at fourteen, received rave reviews for his performance as Morgan in the &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot; drama &quot;The Magpies&quot;, adapted from a Henry James short story. The same year, he was Eric Brandt in &quot;Escape to Happiness&quot;, for the &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; programme and also played John Logie Baird as a boy in the film &quot;A Voice in Vision&quot;. In early 1958, Irvine featured as Archie Almond in five episodes of &quot;Run to Earth&quot;. In June that year, he played Lord Heybrook in &quot;French Without Tears&quot; for the &quot;Saturday Playhouse&quot; TV series and, soon after, was one of the &#x27;Pygmies&#x27; in &quot;Brouhaha&quot;, with Peter Sellers as the Sultan. Irvine then played Raymond opposite Laurence Harvey in &quot;Room at the Top&quot; and, although his scene was cut from the final release, he still appears briefly in the film, handing a bottle of champagne to Harvey during a wedding scene. In late 1959, he featured as Lanky Graham in &quot;Ask for King Billy&quot; and, in early 1960, he played a schoolboy in &quot;A Holiday Abroad&quot; for &quot;ITV Television Playhouse&quot;. Later that year, at eighteen, Irvine performed as Dan in three episodes of &quot;Sheep&#x27;s Clothing&quot;, after which he was offered a two-year contract with the BBC&#x27;s Repertory company (&#x27;The Rep&#x27;), where he befriended the poet Louis MacNeice who worked there as a writer for over twenty years. As Irvine recalled much later: 
However, Irvine would give up acting in his early twenties, after moving to Dublin at the end of his time with the &#x27;Rep&#x27;.

==Influences==

===Music===
Irvine loved music from the earliest time he could remember. His mother had a stack of old, cracked 78s that he used to play on a wind-up gramophone. &quot;They were mainly songs from long forgotten musical comedies but I wish I had them now.&quot; At thirteen, he studied classical guitar for two years, initially with Julian Bream and later under one of Bream&#x27;s pupils but switched to folk music after discovering Woody Guthrie during the Skiffle boom of the 1950s.

Guthrie was to become an enduring influence on his music, on his choice of additional instruments (mandolin and harmonica) and general outlook on life. In a 1985 interview, Irvine expanded on how, in the mid-1950s, he discovered Woody Guthrie through Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s recordings on the EPs &quot;Backstairs Session&quot; and &quot;Skiffle Session&quot;:

In May 1959, Irvine began frequenting the Ballads and Blues Club‚Äîstarted at the Princess Louise pub in High Holborn by Ewan MacColl in 1957‚Äîwhich, by September 1959, had moved to 2, Soho Square under the sole leadership of Malcolm Nixon. American folk musicians who had been closely associated with Guthrie would perform there: Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott, Derroll Adams and Cisco Houston; Irvine befriended all three of them, particularly Elliott, who taught him how to play the harmonica in Guthrie&#x27;s style:
After locating Guthrie at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey, Irvine began corresponding with Sid Gleason who, with her husband Bob, would take Guthrie out of hospital and entertain him at weekends. She was the first person to call him &quot;Andy&quot;, and thereafter remained a conduit between him and Guthrie.


During 1959, Irvine and Elliott also recorded audio tapes to send Guthrie and, after recording one of Guthrie&#x27;s songs, Elliott exclaimed: &quot;Andy, you sound more like Woody than I do!&quot;, just as Guthrie had once said to Elliott: &quot;Jack, you sound more like me than I do!&quot;. However, Irvine&#x27;s dream to join Guthrie in the States eventually faded when his mother died in 1961.

In 1991, Irvine wrote his tribute song to Woody Guthrie: &quot;Never Tire of the Road&quot;, first released on the solo album &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;. He recorded it again for the album &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;, released in 1996, after including another verse plus the chorus from a song Guthrie recorded in March 1944: &quot;You Fascists Are Bound to Lose&quot;.

In a 2000 interview, Irvine stated: &quot;I never met Woody, but I corresponded with him in hospital. [...] The kind of values that Woody represented are one of my great passions.&quot;

===Social justice===
Irvine is a card-carrying member of the Industrial Workers of the World (the &#x27;Wobblies&#x27;), with an avowed commitment to social justice. One example is his song &quot;The Spirit of Mother Jones&quot;, which champions the life, social activism and energetic organising leadership of Mary Harris Jones (&#x27;Mother Jones&#x27;), which he recorded and released on his 2010 album &quot;Abocurragh&quot;. On 1 August 2012, Irvine performed in Shandon, County Cork, for the inaugural Mother Jones Festival which celebrated the 175th Anniversary of the birth of Mary Harris; he performed at the Festival again on 1 August 2013.

Like other artists contracted to perform at F√©ile Iorrais (a community festival in Erris) in August 2007, Irvine was disgusted to learn that Royal Dutch Shell were partly sponsoring the events. Shell&#x27;s plans for the Corrib gas project have been the subject of controversy in County Mayo. Irvine pledged to donate part of his fee to the Shell to Sea campaign.

==Music career==
===1960s: Dublin, Sweeney&#x27;s Men, Eastern Europe===
====Move to Dublin and transition from acting to folk music====
In 1962, when his two-year contract with the BBC&#x27;s &#x27;Rep&#x27; ended, Irvine moved to Dublin and continued earning a living as an actor for a while, playing at The Olympia, The Gaiety, The Gate and The Eblana. He also performed at the Pike Theatre, where he played the role of Jerry as one of only two actors in Edward Albee&#x27;s &quot;The Zoo Story&quot;, and where he also appeared as Tethra (the Irish god of war) in &quot;Moytura&quot; by P√°draic Colum, during the Dublin Theatre Festival in 1963. In late 1963, he had a part in a few episodes of &quot;Down at Flannery&#x27;s&quot;, a forerunner of the popular RT√â soap&quot;Tolka Row&quot; in which he appeared for five episodes in the role of Jim &quot;Beardie&quot; Toomey, the boyfriend of Laurie Morton&#x27;s character, Peggy Kinnear. One of his last acting performances was at the Olympia Theatre on 28 September 1964 as Sir Peregrine in &quot;Sir Buccaneer&quot;, a musical by G.P. Gallivan.

However, he very quickly noticed that a burgeoning folk scene was emerging, centred around the Baggot Street‚ÄìMerrion quarter of Dublin&#x27;s city centre. &quot;As soon as I found my feet there, I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s it, goodbye acting!. After discovering Irish music through S√©amus Ennis on Peter Kennedy&#x27;s BBC programme &quot;As I Roved Out&quot; and through Ciar√°n Mac Math√∫na on Raidi√≥ √âireann, Irvine studiously spent many hours at the National Library, scouring old songbooks like the Child Ballads and Sam Henry&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the People&quot;, as well as A.L. Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;Penguin Book of English Folk Songs&quot;. He also drew inspiration from Ewan MacColl, notably the songs he wrote for his radio-ballads.

Gravitating around Paddy and Maureen O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s Pub, Irvine met like-minded people such as Ronnie Drew, Luke Kelly and Barney McKenna, who would later form The Dubliners. Decades later, he recorded &quot;O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s&quot;‚Äîreleased on the album &quot;Changing Trains&quot; (2004)‚Äîa song of eleven verses in which he vividly recalls these happy times, naming many of the people who were part of his transition from actor to folk musician.

====Sweeney&#x27;s Men ‚Äì &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s Men&quot;====
One of these people was Johnny Moynihan, with whom he created a musical partnership which turned into Sweeney&#x27;s Men in the summer of 1966, after the addition of &#x27;Galway Joe&#x27; Dolan. To quote Colin Irwin: &quot;They merged the familiar American folk style so popular in the early sixties with a distinctively home-grown Irish flavour; it was not Irish music but it was real and exciting, it had verve, imagination and style.&quot; A distinctive aspect of the Sweeney&#x27;s Men sound was Moynihan&#x27;s introduction of the bouzouki‚Äîoriginally a Greek instrument‚Äîinto Irish music, albeit with a different tuning: GDAD&#x27; (one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin), instead of the modern Greek tuning of CFAD&#x27;.

In 1996, Irvine wrote:
While in the process of adopting the itinerant lifestyle of a musician, Irvine developed a taste for travel, initially within Ireland. The first time he witnessed Willie Clancy playing his uilleann pipes was at a fleadh in Miltown Malbay in the summer of 1963, and he followed the festival trail in Ireland during the summers of 1964, 1965 and 1966. Irvine also returned regularly to London for short stays of a few weeks or months, and ventured further afield across Europe, hitch-hiking to Munich, Vienna and Rome in the autumn of 1965. In early 1966, he was playing the clubs in Denmark with √âamonn O&#x27;Doherty. In June 1966, Irvine and Dolan played five nights a week as a duo at the Enda Hotel in Galway and Moynihan would join them at weekends, since he was still working as a draughtsman in Roscommon. It was at this time that Dolan suggested the band&#x27;s name, after reading Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s comic novel &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;, which depicts the mad, anti-religious, tree-leaping pagan King Sweeney of Antrim.

In a 2005 interview, Irvine added:
The trio recorded their first single &quot;Old Maid in the Garrett&quot;/&quot;The Derby Ram&quot; for Pye Records at Eamonn Andrews Studios in the spring of 1967. The week the single was in the Irish charts, Dolan departed for Israel and the Six-Day War &quot;but it took him a year to get down there&quot;, and was replaced by Terry Woods ‚Äì later of Steeleye Span and The Pogues.

In early 1968, the new line-up recorded the eponymous album, &quot;Sweeney&#x27;s Men&quot;, produced by Bill Leader at Livingston Studios, Barnet. In addition to playing either guitar, mandolin or harmonica on most tracks, Irvine contributed four songs: &quot;Sally Brown&quot;, &quot;Willy O&#x27; Winsbury&quot;, &quot;Dance to Your Daddy&quot;, and &quot;Reynard The Fox&quot;.

He also played Moynihan&#x27;s bouzouki‚Äîfor the first time on a recording‚Äîon the track &quot;Johnston&quot;.

Irvine wrote his first song, &quot;West Coast of Clare&quot;, in the late summer of 1968, around the time Sweeney&#x27;s Men were playing one of their last shows in Quilty, County Clare. &quot;It was actually written with a Danish girl called Birte in mind, but [...] it very quickly became a memory of great times in Clare. I started the song in County Clare and finished it in Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, in August or September 1968.&quot;

Irvine left Sweeney&#x27;s Men after a final performance at Liberty Hall in Dublin, where he played the first half of the set with Moynihan and Woods before making way for his replacement, Henry McCullough, who played the second half.

====Discovering Eastern Europe and Bulgarian folk music====
In the late summer of 1968, Irvine and his first wife Muriel headed off to Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
He later wrote several songs about his experiences there: 
*&quot;Time Will Cure Me&quot;, which he recorded in 1973 with Planxty on the album &quot;The Well Below the Valley&quot;;
*&quot;BƒÉneasƒÉ&#x27;s Green Glade&quot;, which he recorded in 1974 with Planxty on the album &quot;Cold Blow and the Rainy Night&quot;; 
*&quot;Autumn Gold&quot;, which he recorded in 1976 with Paul Brady on their duo album, &quot;Andy Irvine/Paul Brady&quot; and 
*&quot;Rainy Sundays&quot;, which he recorded in 1980 on his debut solo album, &quot;Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams&quot;.

During a series of hitch-hiking journeys across Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania, Irvine discovered the region&#x27;s folk music styles and was particularly attracted to the Bulgarian tradition. In a 1992 interview, he related the moment he first heard Bulgarian folk music:

This lasting fascination with Bulgarian folk music would inform several of his later projects‚Äîfirst with Planxty, then in the recording of his first solo album (1980) and of the album &quot;East Wind&quot; (1992), and also with the creation of two multicultural, similarly named bands: Mosaic (1984‚Äì85) and Mozaik (2002‚Äìpresent day). In turn, Irvine&#x27;s integration of characteristic elements of Bulgarian folk music into his playing, such as asymmetric rhythms, would also have a profound influence on the sound of contemporary Irish music, including‚Äîvia Bill Whelan‚Äîthe original &quot;Riverdance&quot; score.

He also went to Thessaloniki, a Greek-Macedonian town near the Bulgarian border, to buy a bouzouki: 
While in Ljubljana, he met Rens van der Zalm, a young, classically trained violinist from the Netherlands who also played guitar, mandolin, piano, accordion and tin whistle, and who was one of the founders of the Dutch folk group Fungus. They would later join forces in several of Irvine&#x27;s projects.

When he returned to Dublin in the autumn of 1969, Sweeney&#x27;s Men‚Äînow reduced to Moynihan and Woods‚Äîwas breaking up and Irvine played a final gig with them at Nottingham University in October or November 1969.

===1970s: Duo with D√≥nal Lunny, &quot;Prosperous&quot;, Planxty, duos with Paul Brady and Mick Hanly===

====Duo with D√≥nal Lunny ‚Äì &quot;The Blacksmith&quot;====
After the demise of Sweeney&#x27;s Men, a new Irish-English folk super-group was almost formed in 1970, with Irvine, Moynihan, Woods and his wife Gay, plus ex-Fairport Convention Ashley Hutchings joining on bass guitar, but this never happened.

For a while, Irvine performed regularly at Slattery&#x27;s Pub on Capel Street. Then, he met D√≥nal Lunny, with whom he formed a duo after an initial gig at a party for the Irish-Soviet Union Friendship conference organised by Se√°n Mac R√©amoinn:
Says Leagues O&#x27;Toole: &quot;This partnership also furthered the presence of the bouzouki in Irish music. Just as Johnny Moynihan had introduced the instrument to Andy Irvine, he in turn passed it on to D√≥nal Lunny&quot;. As Lunny himself recalled:
In a 2015 interview, Irvine added his recollection of that event: 
They also created their own club night, downstairs at Slattery&#x27;s Pub, which they called &#x27;The Mug&#x27;s Gig&#x27;. This featured Irvine and Lunny, and guest performers such as Ronnie Drew, Mellow Candle, and the group Supply, Demand &amp; Curve. Clodagh Simonds, who co-founded Mellow Candle with Alison O&#x27;Donnell in 1963, recalls:
By that time, Irvine had put together his own version of &quot;The Blacksmith&quot;, followed by a self-penned coda‚Äîin a Bulgarian rhythm‚Äîwhich would later be given the title of &quot;Blacksmithereens&quot; by Christy Moore, at a Planxty concert in 1973.

====Christy Moore ‚Äì &quot;Prosperous&quot;====
Before too long, Irvine and Lunny participated in a project that would lead to their big break. Moore, who had moved to England during the National Bank Strike of 1966, had become an established musician in the English folk music scene and even recorded his first album (&quot;Paddy on the Road&quot;) there, in 1969, at the Sound Techniques studio in Chelsea.

After that, he decided to record his second album in Ireland and his guest musicians included Irvine, Lunny, and uilleann piper Liam O&#x27;Flynn. The album, &quot;Prosperous&quot;, was recorded by Bill Leader who had brought his mobile recording unit (a Revox tape machine and two microphones) to Ireland in the summer of 1971. Rehearsals took place at Irvine&#x27;s flat in Dublin and the recordings were made in Prosperous, County Kildare, down in the cellar of Downings House, owned by Moore&#x27;s sister and brother-in-law, Anne and Davoc Rynne.

In his annotated book of songs, first published in 2000, Moore recalls:
In the words of Colin Irwin:

This was released as an album by Moore, but the four musicians soon thereafter formed Planxty in January 1972, to be managed by Des Kelly.

====Planxty====
After honing their live set at Slattery&#x27;s, they played two concerts, afternoon and evening, at Newbridge College on Thursday, 16 March 1972. Donovan was in the audience and invited Planxty to open for him on his six-date Irish tour the following week, during which their first major performance‚Äîat the Hangar in Galway‚Äîwas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through the glare of the stage lights, was worried that the crowd might be on the verge of rioting. It took him several minutes to realise that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band&#x27;s music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.

The group would go on to sign a six-record contract and to tour extensively throughout Europe. They played mostly traditional songs and tunes, but several were Irvine compositions, making him the lone composer of the band. Instrumentally the group was notable for the intricate bouzouki and mandolin counterpoint of Lunny and Irvine, along with O&#x27;Flynn&#x27;s exceptional pipering; Irvine and Moore (who played guitar) were the principal vocalists. Very quickly, Lunny would also develop into their own in-house producer, arranger and musical director: &quot;It very rapidly established itself that the music demanded to be treated on its own terms. It influenced our arrangements. [...] I think it was unfamiliar to people to hear traditional music with a chassis under it and it still sounds like traditional music.&quot;

Irvine contributed four songs to their first album, &quot;Planxty&quot;, recorded at the Command Studios in London during early September 1972 and released in early 1973: &quot;Arthur McBride&quot;, &quot;West Coast of Clare&quot;, &quot;The Jolly Beggar&quot;, and &quot;The Blacksmith&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;The Well Below The Valley&quot; was recorded at Escape Studios in Kent, England, from 18 June 1973 until the end of the month, and released the same year. It features three songs by Irvine: &quot;Pat Reilly&quot;, &quot;As I Roved Out&quot;, and &quot;Time Will Cure Me&quot;.

After the completion of this album, Planxty embarked on their first tour of Germany, where the group had become very popular. They also toured extensively in Ireland and were making more frequent trips abroad to festivals in Brittany and in England, at the Durham Folk Festival and the Cambridge Folk Festival. At the start of September 1973, Lunny resigned after playing his last gig with the band at the Edinburgh Festival. He was replaced by Johnny Moynihan.

Rehearsals for Planxty&#x27;s third album, &quot;Cold Blow and the Rainy Night&quot;, began in the summer of 1974 at Moynihan&#x27;s family summer home in Rush, on the north coast of County Dublin. At Irvine&#x27;s behest, Lunny was co-opted back into the band to arrange the selected material and to play on the album, which was recorded in Sarm Studios, Whitechapel, London during August 1974 and released the same year. It includes four pieces by Irvine: &quot;Johnny Cope&quot;, &quot;BƒÉneasƒÉ&#x27;s Green Glade&quot;, &quot;Mominsko Horo&quot;, and &quot;The Green Fields of Canada&quot;.

After the completion of this third album, Moore resigned and was replaced by Strabane native Paul Brady. The band&#x27;s new line-up (Irvine, O&#x27;Flynn, Moynihan, and Brady) toured extensively but released no recordings, breaking up after playing their final show in Brussels on 5 December 1975.

====Duo with Paul Brady ‚Äì &quot;Andy Irvine/Paul Brady&quot;====
Irvine continued to tour with Brady, including a series of concerts in the USA in 1977 (Irvine&#x27;s first ever visit there) highlighted by a very successful gig at the Town Hall in New York. Irvine was also invited by Alec Finn to join De Dannan after Dolores Keane had left, but he soon had to relinquish this new venture because of scheduling conflicts. Nonetheless, Irvine performed with De Dannan at &#x27;The 3rd Irish Folk Festival&#x27; in Germany on 30 April 1976, playing &quot;Martinmas Time/Danny O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;Ma√≠re Rua/Hardiman The Fiddler&quot;, &quot;The Emigrant&#x27;s Farewell&quot;, &quot;The Boys of Ballysodare&quot; and &quot;The Plains of Kildare&quot;.

In August 1976, Irvine and Brady recorded an album together at the Rockfield Studios, &quot;Andy Irvine/Paul Brady&quot;, produced by Lunny who also plays on most tracks, and with Kevin Burke on fiddle; it was released in December 1976 by Mulligan Music Ltd. This album included &quot;Autumn Gold&quot;, on which Irvine commented: &quot;Written in Ljubljana in 1968, while sitting in a sunny park, stood up on a date. Waiting, as ever, for Vida.&quot; It is the final song of a quartet written during his sojourn in Eastern Europe during 1968‚Äì69, after spending several months in the Slovenian capital.

The 40th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release was celebrated by a tour of Ireland scheduled for May 2017, featuring the original personnel: Irvine, Brady, Lunny and Burke. The tour visited: Cork, Dublin, Derry, Limerick, Galway and Belfast. During October 2018, the anniversary tour was repeated with one-night concerts in Dublin, Cork, London and Prague.

====Duo with Mick Hanly ‚Äì &quot;As I Went Over Blackwater&quot;====
Irvine also toured extensively in Europe with Mick Hanly, including at &#x27;The 4th Irish Folk Festival&#x27; in Germany on 30 April 1977. They started their set with Irvine performing a full version of &quot;Johnny Cope&quot;: first the song, followed by the 6-part hornpipe of the same name, which Irvine played complete on bouzouki. Hanly then sang &quot;A Kiss in the Morning Early&quot;. Irvine followed with &quot;Bonny Woodhall&quot;, accompanying himself on Fylde &#x27;Octavius&#x27; bouzouki (with the bottom two courses strung in octave). This recording of &quot;Bonny Woodhall&quot; is Irvine&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Bonny Woodha (H476 in Sam Henry&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the People&quot;) and would later appear as a bonus track on the CD version of &quot;Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams&quot;. Their set ends with Hanly singing &quot;John Barleycorn&quot; and &quot;The Verdant Braes of Skreen&quot;.

The following year, Irvine and Hanly were joined on stage by Liam O&#x27;Flynn at &#x27;The 5th Irish Folk Festival&#x27; in Germany on 28 April 1978, playing &quot;I Buried My Wife And Danced on Top of Her&quot;, a jig learnt from uilleann piper Willie Clancy; &quot;Molly Bawn&quot;, sung by Hanly (with Irvine on hurdy-gurdy first, then on bouzouki); &quot;Brian O&#x27;Lynn/Sean Bun&quot;; &quot;I Courted A Wee Girl&quot;; &quot;The Longford Weaver&quot; sung by Irvine accompanying himself on hurdy-gurdy and harmonica; and &quot;Masters Return/Kittie&#x27;s Wedding&quot;.

Two years later, in 1980, Hanly released his second solo album &quot;As I Went Over Blackwater&quot;, featuring Irvine on four tracks: &quot;Jack Haggerty&quot; (harmonicas), &quot;The Guerriere and The Constitution&quot; (harmony vocals and hurdy-gurdy), &quot;Every Circumstance&quot; (mandolin) and &quot;Miss Bailey/Jessica&#x27;s Polka&quot; (harmonica).

====&quot;The Gathering&quot;====
Sometime during 1977, Irvine also recorded &quot;The Gathering&quot;, along with Paul Brady, D√≥nal Lunny, Matt Molloy, Tommy Potts, Tr√≠ona N√≠ Dhomhnaill and uilleann piper Peter Browne. This album was funded by Diane Meek, a Guggenheim heiress who had used the pseudonym &quot;Hamilton&quot; as her maiden name to disguise her wealth. She was the owner of Tradition Records and a patron of traditional music in Dublin at the time. She had lent Mulligan Records money in the early days and had also formed a small record label for traditional music called &quot;Sruth√°in&quot; [a stream], on which she had intended to release &quot;The Gathering&quot;. However, the album was finally released in 1981 on Greenhays, a label connected with Rounder Records.

Irvine contributed two songs to the album: &quot;There&#x27;s Sure To Be A Row&quot;, and &quot;The Mall of Lismore&quot;. He also plays mandolin and harmonica on Paul Brady&#x27;s cover of &quot;Heather on the Moor&quot;, a song learned from Eddie Butcher.

====Paul Brady ‚Äì &quot;Welcome Here Kind Stranger&quot;====
On Friday 21 July 1978, Brady launched his album &quot;Welcome Here Kind Stranger&quot; with a concert in the auditorium of Liberty Hall in Dublin. He decided to record the concert on his own domestic Akai reel-to-reel tape machine with Brian Masterson in attendance, who had engineered the album and was doing the sound that night.

Performing with him were: Lunny, O&#x27;Flynn, Paddy Glackin, Matt Molloy, Noel Hill and Irvine, who played on nine of the ten numbers performed that night: &quot;Paddy&#x27;s Green Shamrock Shore&quot; (harmonica, mandolin); &quot;I Am A Youth That&#x27;s Inclined To Ramble&quot; (hurdy-gurdy); &quot;The Creel/Out The Door And Over The Wall&quot; (mandolin, bouzouki); &quot;The Jolly Soldier/The Blarney Pilgrim&quot; (harmonica, bouzouki); &quot;Mary And The Soldier&quot; (mandolin, harmonica); &quot;Jackson And Jane&quot; (hurdy-gurdy); &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Again&quot; (mandolin); &quot;The Lakes Of Pontchartrain&quot; (bouzouki); &quot;The Crooked Road To Dublin&quot; (Portuguese guitarra with 8 tuners [4 removed], re-strung with 4 courses and tuned like a mandola).

After the concert, Brady took the tapes home and only found them again in November 2000, still in good enough condition to be transferred onto CD and released, in 2002, under the title &quot;The Missing Liberty Tapes&quot;.

====Planxty ‚Äì &quot;After The Break&quot;====
By the autumn of 1978, Moore was ready to re-form the original Planxty line-up, complete with Lunny, who brought along flutist Matt Molloy from The Bothy Band, and rehearsals began on Tuesday, 19 September 1978. Their new manager, Kevin Flynn, then organised a mammoth European tour for the following year, from 15 April to 11 June 1979, during which the band played forty-seven concerts in fifty-eight days, in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France and Ireland.

After the tour, the band went to Windmill Lane Studios from 18 to 30 June 1979 to record their fourth album: &quot;After The Break&quot;, released the same year. Irvine contributed three pieces to the album: &quot;You Rambling Boys of Pleasure&quot;, &quot;The Rambling Si√∫ler&quot;, and &quot;Smeceno Horo&quot;.

After recording the album, Planxty resumed touring more sporadically, playing The National in Kilburn, a handful of dates in Belgium and France, and also headlining the third Ballisodare Festival. Molloy left Planxty to join The Chieftains in the autumn of 1979.

===1980s: Solo album, Planxty, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;, Mosaic, Patrick Street===
====&quot;Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams&quot;====
At the end of 1979, Irvine recorded his first solo album at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin: &quot;Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams&quot;, produced by D√≥nal Lunny and released on Tara Records in 1980. Personnel included Irvine, Lunny, O&#x27;Flynn, Brady (guitar and piano), Frankie Gavin (fiddle), Rick Epping (accordion, harmonica, jaw harp), John Wadham (bongo and congas), Paul Barrett (Fender Rhodes and Polymoog), Keith Donald (soprano sax) and Lucienne Purcell (vocals).

This first solo album showcased songs and tunes from two of his main influences: side one (on the vinyl LP) featured pieces inspired by Irish traditional music, and side two choices concentrated on Balkan music. The original, vinyl album closed with the self-penned &quot;Rainy Sundays&quot;, a nostalgic song reminiscing about Vida, with whom Irvine pursued &quot;a one-sided romance in Ljubljana years ago.&quot;
====&quot;High Kings of Tara&quot;====
In 1980, Tara Records released &quot;High Kings of Tara&quot;, a compilation album showcasing tracks previously released by some of its artists: Shaun Davey, Ois√≠n, Jolyon Jackson, Paddy Glackin, Paddy Keenan, Stockton&#x27;s Wing and Christy Moore.

This album also included five previously unreleased tracks by Planxty, Irvine and Moore. Two of these, Irvine&#x27;s &quot;The Bonny Light Horseman&quot; and a set of reels by Planxty, &quot;Lord McDonald/The Chattering Magpie&quot;, were subsequently added to the CD version of &quot;After The Break&quot;. The remaining three tracks were: &quot;General Monroe&quot; ‚Äì a traditional song re-arranged by Irvine (bouzouki, harmonica) in duet with Lunny (guitar); &quot;First Slip/Hardyman The Fiddler A&amp;B/The Yellow Wattle&quot; ‚Äì a set of jigs by Planxty, including Matt Molloy; and &quot;John of Dreams&quot; ‚Äì a ballad by Moore, which was later re-released on the CD version of &quot;The Iron Behind the Velvet&quot;.

====Planxty ‚Äì &quot;The Woman I loved So Well&quot;====
On 28 February 1980, Planxty headlined the &quot;Sense of Ireland&quot; concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. When they returned to Ireland, they recorded two programmes for RT√â at the Pavilion Theatre in D√∫n Laoghaire, then started rehearsals at Kilkea Castle in Castledermot, County Kildare with two musicians from County Clare: concertina player Noel Hill and fiddler Tony Linnane. This six-member formation of Moore, Irvine, Lunny, O&#x27;Flynn, Hill and Linnane were joined by Matt Molloy and keyboardist Bill Whelan, to record the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Woman I Loved So Well&quot;, at Windmill Lane Studios over two periods: 23‚Äì29 April and 16‚Äì19 May. The album was wrapped up with a reception at Windmill Lane Studios on 9 June and released on Tara Records in July 1980. Irvine contributed three songs to the album: &quot;Roger O&#x27;Hehir&quot;, &quot;Kellswater&quot;, and &quot;Johnny of Brady&#x27;s Lea&quot;.

Planxty then resumed touring as a four-piece again during the summer of 1980, playing a tour of Italian castles in July and returning to The Boys of Ballisodare festival on 9 August, where they were joined by Whelan and a young Cork fiddler, Nollaig Casey. Shows around this time would feature the quartet for the first set, with Whelan and Casey joining in for the second set. This sextet played a week of shows at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin on 18‚Äì23 August 1980, which was recorded for a potential live album that eventually emerged in 1987 as the unlicensed release &quot;The Best of Planxty Live&quot;. The same sextet also played a series of one-off events, including at the Hammersmith Odeon in March 1981, and recorded a suite called &quot;Timedance&quot;‚Äîwith full orchestra and rhythm section‚Äîwhich was also performed during the interval of the Eurovision Song Contest, held in Dublin on 4 April 1981. &quot;Timedance&quot; was the genesis of what Whelan would later compose for &quot;Riverdance&quot;.

====&quot;Parallel Lines&quot; with Dick Gaughan====
In his online autobiography, Irvine recalls:
In August 1981, Irvine and Gaughan recorded &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; at G√ºnter Pauler&#x27;s Tonstudio in St Blasien/Herrenhaus, Northeim, Germany, released in 1982 on the German &quot;FolkFreak-Platten&quot; label. It was produced by Gaughan, Irvine and Carsten Linde, with a line-up including Gaughan (acoustic and electric guitars, bass guitar and vocal), Irvine (bouzouki, mandola, mandolin, harmonica, hurdy-gurdy and vocal), Nollaig Casey (fiddle), Martin Buschmann (saxophone), Judith Jaenicke (flute) and Bob Lenox (Fender Rhodes piano). D√≥nal Lunny also overdubbed the fiddle parts and remixed the album at Lombard Sound Studios in Dublin.

In 1997, &quot;Parallel Lines&quot; was re-issued on CD, including &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot; as a bonus track that Irvine and Gaughan had recorded during the above-mentioned &quot;Folk Friends 2&quot; recording sessions, held in 1980.

About the recording of &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;, Irvine would later comment:
Irvine and Gaughan did, however, perform live at Whelan&#x27;s venue in Dublin on Wednesday 2 February 2011, nearly thirty years after recording &quot;Parallel Lines&quot;.

====Planxty ‚Äì &quot;Words and Music&quot;====
The Planxty sextet continued to tour, but began to drift apart. In 1980, O&#x27;Flynn recorded &quot;The Brendan Voyage&quot; with Shaun Davey. Moore and Lunny, eager to experiment with a rhythm section and a different, more political song set, formed Moving Hearts in 1981. Lunny also kept busy producing albums by other artists. As a result of all these parallel projects, the original quartet would end up playing their last show together on 24 August 1982, at the National Stadium in Dublin.

Nevertheless, Planxty‚Äîwith Whelan and Casey still on board‚Äîreconvened at Windmill Lane Studios in late October and early November 1982, to record &quot;Words &amp; Music&quot;, which also featured fiddler James Kelly and Moving Hearts bass guitarist Eoghan O&#x27;Neill. It was released on the WEA label in 1983. Irvine contributed three pieces to the album: &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot;, &quot;Accidentals&quot;, and &quot;Aragon Mill&quot;.

A final line-up that Irvine dubbed &quot;Planxty-Too-Far&quot;‚ÄîIrvine, O&#x27;Flynn, Whelan, Arty McGlynn on guitar, James Kelly on fiddle and singer Dolores Keane, but without Casey‚Äîundertook a UK tour on Friday, 1 April 1983, followed by a series of live engagements in Ireland, an appearance on the &quot;Late Late Show&quot; and some eight shows, including the National Stadium in Dublin on 27 April 1983. Two days later, Irvine went on tour in the Balkans and, on his return in mid-June, found that: &quot;to my surprise, the band hadn&#x27;t actually split up, it has just fallen asunder. An unfortunate ending to the second coming...&quot;.

====After Planxty====
Irvine resumed his solo career, playing occasionally with McGlynn and Casey, and also travelled to Hungary, where he played and fraternised with local musicians:

The singer from Muzsik√°s, M√°rta Sebesty√©n, would soon thereafter be joining Irvine&#x27;s next multicultural folk group: Mosaic. He also met multi-instrumentalist Nikola Parov (Sebesty√©n&#x27;s then husband),&lt;ref name=&quot;FR158/159&quot;&gt;&quot;M√°rta&#x27;s Cause&quot;, by Ken Hunt in &quot;Folk Roots&quot; No.158/159, Aug/Sep 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; who would go on to participate in several of Irvine&#x27;s projects, the first being the album &quot;East Wind&quot; (1992), which featured Sebesty√©n. Irvine would later write a song about this period of his life in Budapest: &quot;The Wind Blows Over The Danube&quot;, released on the album &quot;Changing Trains&quot;.

====Mosaic====
In the winter of 1984, Irvine gathered a collection of musicians from throughout Europe and formed Mosaic, with a line-up including Irvine, D√≥nal Lunny along with his former Moving Hearts associate, uilleann piper Declan Masterson, Danish bassist and singer Lissa Ladefoged, Dutch guitarist and singer Hans Theessink, and singer M√°rta Sebesty√©n.

Their first public gig was in Budapest on 12 July 1985, followed by a further two gigs in Hungary and an appearance at the Dranouter festival in Belgium in early August, prior to their English tour. Their seventh gig was billed at the Southport Arts Center, which Chris Hardwick of Folk Roots reviewed with the following introduction: &quot;Every once in a while the folk scene throws up a new permutation in which exceptionally gifted individuals come together to produce something so innovative and exhilarating that it goes way beyond the sum of the parts&quot;.

Their set included: Stan Rogers&#x27;s &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, an unspecified Macedonian dance tune (&quot;one of Andy&#x27;s 90 mph specials&quot;), a solo Hungarian love song from Sebesty√©n, a brooding cover of Eric Von Schmidt&#x27;s Caribbean lament &quot;Joshua Gone Barbados&quot; from Theessink, the Irish three (Irvine, Lunny and Masterson) on a set of reels including &quot;The Spike Island Lasses&quot;, and Irvine singing Andy Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Indiana&quot;. However, the band lasted only that one summer.

A couple of years later, Irvine stated that he would have liked to try the experiment again by concentrating on the Irish and East European sound without bringing in the blues influence.

====Patrick Street====
Also in 1985, Irvine joined up with fiddler Kevin Burke and guitarist M√≠che√°l √ì Domhnaill (who had been gigging together around America for some time) and toured as a trio in the USA; when √ì Domhnaill wasn&#x27;t available for some of the dates, guitarist/vocalist Gerry O&#x27;Beirne stepped in. &quot;This tour was such fun and so successful that we decided to expand the outfit into a four-piece by adding Jackie Daly&quot;, Irvine wrote.

Initially billed on a 1986 American tour as &quot;The Legends of Irish Music&quot;, they soon chose to call themselves Patrick Street. The line-up for the band underwent several changes, but always included Irvine, Burke, and Daly. The guitar role, however, passed:
*from O&#x27;Beirne to Arty McGlynn ‚Äì before the recording of their first album, &quot;Patrick Street&quot;, which began in August 1986;
*from McGlynn to Ged Foley ‚Äì after the band recorded their fourth album, &quot;All in Good Time&quot;, released in 1993;
*back to McGlynn ‚Äì when they resumed touring after the completion of their ninth album, &quot;On the Fly&quot;, released in 2007.

After Jackie Daly retired from Patrick Street, John Carty joined on fiddle, flute and tenor banjo in time to record &quot;On The Fly&quot;.

Originally agreed to as a part-time band, they have nevertheless recorded eight studio albums together, plus one live album (&quot;Live from Patrick Street&quot;) and two compilations (&quot;The Best of Patrick Street&quot; and &quot;&quot;).

On their first album, &quot;Patrick Street&quot;, released in 1986, Irvine sings four songs: &quot;Patrick Street&quot;, &quot;The Holy Ground&quot;, &quot;The Dream/Indiana&quot;, and &quot;The Man with the Cap&quot;.

&quot;No. 2 Patrick Street&quot;, released in 1988, again features four songs sung by Irvine: &quot;Tom Joad&quot;; &quot;Facing the Chair&quot;; &quot;Braes of Moneymore&quot;, to which Irvine changed the tune and added a verse; and &quot;William Taylor&quot;

Their third album, &quot;Irish Times&quot;, released in 1990, includes three songs by Irvine: &quot;Brackagh Hill&quot;; &quot;Forgotten Hero&quot;, his composition about Michael Davitt; and &quot;The Humours of the King of Ballyhooley&quot;.

====Playing style ‚Äì &quot;The Irish Bouzouki&quot;====
In 1989, Irvine&#x27;s style of playing the bouzouki was summarised thus in &quot;The Irish Bouzouki&quot;, an instructional guide:

The tutor also provided simple standard notation scores and lyrics for two of Irvine&#x27;s songs: &quot;Brackagh Hill&quot; (which he recorded with Patrick Street on the album &quot;Irish Times&quot; released the same year) and &quot;Bridget&quot;, a song written by Jane Cassidy which he never released elsewhere. The cassette accompanying this tutor provided both songs, with Irvine accompanying himself on bouzouki. In the same tutor, Irvine&#x27;s Irish bouzouki tuning (GDAD&#x27;, one octave lower than similarly open-tuned mandolin) was also contrasted with the traditional Greek bouzouki tuning (CFAD&#x27;).

In a 1985 interview with the American &quot;Frets&quot; magazine, Irvine had explained the origins of his bouzouki tuning:
===1990s: Solo albums, &quot;East Wind&quot;, Patrick Street===

====&quot;Rude Awakening&quot;====
In December 1990 and January 1991, Irvine recorded his second solo album, &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;, produced by Bill Whelan. The line-up included Whelan (keyboards), Rens van der Zalm (fiddle, mandolin, guitar), Carl Geraghty (soprano saxophone), Arty McGlynn (guitar), Davy Spillane (whistle) and Fionnuala Sherry (fiddle). The album was released on &quot;Green Linnet Records&quot;, later in 1991.

It features &quot;Never Tire of the Road&quot;, Irvine&#x27;s tribute song to Woody Guthrie, alongside mainly self-penned material celebrating some of his other heroes: Raoul Wallenberg, James Connolly, Emiliano Zapata, Michael Dwyer, Douglas Mawson, Aeneas Mackintosh and Sinclair Lewis. The only other traditional song is &quot;Allan McLean&quot;. The sleeve notes of &quot;Love To Be With You&quot; show a faded, black &amp; white photo of Vida, the heroine of his song from ten years earlier: &quot;Rainy Sundays&quot;.

====&quot;East Wind&quot;====
Irvine had also played some Balkan tunes to Whelan and mentioned his aspiration to record them. So, shortly thereafter, he was rehearsing again with Davy Spillane (uilleann pipes and low whistle) to record &quot;East Wind&quot;, a collection of Bulgarian and Macedonian tunes played Irish-style and produced by Whelan, who also contributed keyboards and piano.

The project influenced &quot;Riverdance&quot;:

The extensive line-up included Nikola Parov on Bulgarian instruments (gadulka, kaval, gaida) &amp; bouzouki, M√°irt√≠n O&#x27;Connor (accordion), Noel Eccles &amp; Paul Moran (percussion), Tony Molloy (bass), Carl Geraghty &amp; Kenneth Edge (saxophones), John Sheahan (fiddle), Anthony Drennan (guitar), M√≠che√°l √ì S√∫illeabh√°in (piano), M√°rta Sebesty√©n (vocals) and Rita Connolly (backing vocals).

In an interview with Folk Roots in August 1992, Irvine stated: &quot;We finished it eighteen months ago but [...] John Cook at Tara wanted to try the avenue of big companies.&quot; The album was eventually released on the &quot;Tara&quot; label itself in mid-1992.

For a while, Irvine and Parov were joined by Rens van der Zalm and toured together in Europe as the &#x27;East Wind Trio&#x27;, and then again in the US during 1996.

====Patrick Street ‚Äì &quot;All in Good Time&quot;====
Irvine contributed six pieces to Patrick Street&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;All in Good Time&quot;, released in 1993: &quot;A Prince Among Men (Only a Miner)&quot;; &quot;Lintheads&quot;, a trilogy comprising: &quot;The Pride of the Springfield Road&quot;, &quot;Lawrence Common&quot;, and &quot;Goodbye, Monday Blues&quot;; &quot;Carrowclare&quot;; and &quot;The Girls Along the Road&quot;.

====Patrick Street ‚Äì &quot;Cornerboys&quot;====
Patrick Street&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Cornerboys&quot;, was released in 1996 and includes seven pieces provided by Irvine: &quot;Sweet Lisbweemore&quot;; &quot;Morlough Shore&quot;; &quot;Pity the Poor Hare&quot; (a suite comprising: &quot;On Yonder Hill&quot;, &quot;Merrily Tripping O&#x27;er The Plain&quot;, &quot;The Kilgrain Hare&quot;, and &quot;Pity the Poor Hare&quot;); and &quot;Down By Greer&#x27;s Grove&quot;.

====&quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;====
Recorded in June, July and August 1996, Irvine&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;Rain on the Roof&quot;, is the closest the listener could get to the experience of attending one of his gigs. It was the first release (product number &quot;AK-1&quot;) on his own label, &quot;Andy Irvine&quot;. The album mixes some of Irvine&#x27;s compositions with traditional songs and Bulgarian tunes. As he explains in the sleeve notes:

Other instruments were added (on four of the eleven tracks) by Rens van der Zalm (fiddle and mandolin), Stephen Cooney (didgeridoo, Kpanlogo drum), Declan Masterson (low whistle) and Irvine himself, who played a second mandolin on two of the tracks.

====Patrick Street ‚Äì &quot;Made in Cork&quot;====
Patrick Street&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Made in Cork&quot;, was released in 1997, to which Irvine contributed four songs: &quot;Her Mantle So Green&quot;, &quot;Rainbow &#x27;Mid The Willows&quot;, &quot;Spanking Maggie from the Ross&quot;, and &quot;When Adam Was in Paradise&quot;, another song he learned from the singing of Eddie Butcher.

====Patrick Street ‚Äì &quot;Live from Patrick Street&quot;====
&quot;Live from Patrick Street&quot;, released in 1999, was Patrick Street&#x27;s seventh album, recorded during a tour of Ireland and Britain in November 1998. It features five of Irvine&#x27;s songs: &quot;Braes of Moneymore&quot;, Eddie Butcher&#x27;s &quot;My Son in Amerikay&quot;, &quot;Wild Rover No More&quot;, &quot;Stewball and the Monaghan Grey Mare&quot;, and &quot;The Holy Ground&quot;.

===2000s: Solo album, Mozaik, Patrick Street, Planxty, Marianne Green===

====&quot;Way Out Yonder&quot;====
In 2000, Irvine released his fourth solo album, &quot;Way Out Yonder&quot;, recorded between July and December 1999 and co-produced with Steve Cooney.

Irvine was joined by Rens van der Zalm (guitar, fiddle, mandolin, Bulgarian tambura and bass guitar), Lindsey Horner (double bass), M√°ire Breatnach (viola), Cormac Breatnach (low whistle), Steve Cooney (Spanish guitar, percussion and kalimba), Declan Masterson (uilleann pipes and low whistle), Liam O&#x27;Flynn (uilleann pipes and tin whistle), Nikola Parov (gadulka), Brendan Power (harmonica), plus Lynn Kavanagh, Mandy Murphy and Phil Callery (backing vocals).

====Mozaik ‚Äì &quot;Live from the Powerhouse&quot;====
On 1 March 2002, the seaside town of Rye, Victoria in Australia witnessed the formation and six-day marathon rehearsals of multicultural group Mozaik‚Äînot to be confused with his earlier, similarly named group Mosaic‚Äîfeaturing Irvine, D√≥nal Lunny, Bruce Molsky, Nikola Parov and Rens van der Zalm.

The Australian tour that followed culminated in two gigs recorded at the Brisbane Powerhouse on 30/31 March and released on the album &quot;Live from the Powerhouse&quot; in 2004, under license to Compass Records.
====Patrick Street ‚Äì &quot;Street Life&quot;====
Patrick Street&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Street Life&quot;, was released in 2002. Irvine contributed four pieces: &quot;Barna Hill&quot;, &quot;Down in Matewan&quot;, &quot;Lost Indian&quot;, and &quot;Green Grows the Laurel&quot;.

====Planxty (&quot;The Third Coming&quot;) ‚Äì &quot;Live 2004&quot;====
In late 2002, broadcaster and journalist Leagues O&#x27;Toole was working as presenter and researcher for the RT√â television show &quot;No Disco&quot; and persuaded the programme editor, Rory Cobbe, to develop a one-off documentary about Planxty.

O&#x27;Toole proceeded with interviewing Moore, Irvine and O&#x27;Flynn but Lunny, who was living in Japan, was unavailable. After also shooting links at key landmarks from the Planxty history, the programme aired on 3 March 2003, receiving a phenomenal response from the public and some very positive feedback from the Planxty members themselves. In a final comment about the constant speculation of the original line-up regrouping, Moore had stated, on camera: &quot;There&#x27;s nobody longs for it more than myself and the other three guys. Definitely the time is right. Let&#x27;s go for it&quot;.

A few months later, Paddy Doherty, owner of the Royal Spa Hotel in Lisdoonvarna (and co-founder of the Lisdoonvarna Music Festival), arranged for the band&#x27;s use of the hotel&#x27;s old dining room for rehearsals, which led to a one-off concert there in front of 200 people on 11 October 2003. Moore, on stage, credited the &quot;No Disco&quot; documentary with inspiring the reunion.

Pleased with the results and the experience of playing together again, the original Planxty quartet agreed to the longed-for reunion (dubbed &quot;The Third Coming&quot;) and would perform together again, on and off, for a period of just over a year.

Planxty first played a series of concerts at the Gl√≥r Theatre in Ennis, County Clare (on 23 &amp; 24 January 2004) and at Vicar Street in Dublin (on 30 &amp; 31 January and on 4 &amp; 5, 11 &amp; 12 February 2004), which were recorded and from which selected material was released on the CD &quot;Live 2004&quot; and its associated DVD.

In late 2004 and early 2005, another round of concerts took place at the following venues:

* Radisson SAS Hotel in Galway (6, 7 and 8 October 2004); 
* Point Theatre in Dublin (28, 29 and 30 December 2004, plus extra dates on 3, 4 and 5 January 2005);
* Waterfront Hall in Belfast (19, 20 and 21 January 2005);
* Barbican Centre in London (29, 30 and 31 January 2005).

The original Planxty quartet never performed live again, nor recorded new material together. Liam O&#x27;Flynn died in 2018.

====Solo version of &quot;As I Roved Out&quot;====
In May 2005, Irvine wrote in his website journal: &quot;Also premiered &quot;As I Roved Out&quot; with my own accompaniment. It&#x27;s always been a Planxty number till now with D√≥nal playing Baritone Guitar and me just singing it.&quot; A recording of this version of &quot;As I Roved Out&quot; was eventually released on Peter Ratzenbeck&#x27;s album &quot;Resonances&quot; in 2007, where Irvine appeared as a guest and played it solo on his &quot;Stefan Sobell mandola, tuned CGDG (Capo 0)&quot;.

====Mozaik ‚Äì &quot;Changing Trains&quot;====
In January and April 2005, Mozaik rehearsed new material for &quot;Changing Trains&quot;, their first studio album recorded in Budapest during November of the same year.

This album was initially released by the band in Australia in 2006 and, after additional re-mixing by Lunny at Longbeard Studios in Dublin, was re-released in the autumn of 2007 under license to Compass Records.
====Patrick Street ‚Äì &quot;On the Fly&quot;====
Patrick Street&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;On the Fly&quot;, was released in 2007. Irvine provided three songs: &quot;Sergeant Small&quot;, &quot;The Rich Irish Lady&quot;, and &quot;Erin Go Bragh&quot;.

====Marianne Green ‚Äì &quot;Dear Irish Boy&quot;====
Irvine arranged and produced Marianne Green&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Dear Irish Boy&quot;, released in 2009. Personnel included: Marianne Green (vocals), Irvine (bouzouki, mandolin, mandola, bass-bouzouki, harmonica), Colum Sands (double bass, concertina) and Gerry O&#x27;Conner (violin).

The tracks are: &quot;The Banks of the Bann&quot; (trad.), &quot;You Make Me Fly&quot; (M. Green), &quot;T√° M√© &#x27;Mo Shu√≠&quot; (trad.), &quot;The Doffin Mistress&quot; (trad.), &quot;Bonny Portmore&quot; (trad.), &quot;Ar A Ghabh√°il Go Baile √Åtha Cliath Damh&quot; (trad.), &quot;Cian&#x27;s Song&quot; (M. O&#x27;Hare), &quot;The Dear Irish Boy&quot; (trad.), &quot;The Wife&#x27;s Lamentation&quot; (M. Green), &quot;The Road To Dundee&quot; (trad.), &quot;The Wreck of the Newcastle Fishermen&quot; (trad.) and &quot;Carrickmannon Lake&quot; (trad.).

===2010s: Solo albums, LAPD, duo with Rens van der Zalm, Usher&#x27;s Island===
====&quot;Abocurragh&quot;====
In August 2010, Irvine released his fifth solo album: &quot;Abocurragh&quot;, recorded in Dublin, Norway, Australia, Hungary and Brittany between February 2009 and April 2010 and produced by D√≥nal Lunny, who also plays on all but one of the tracks.

They were joined by Liam O&#x27;Flynn (uilleann pipes, tin whistle), Nikola Parov (kaval, nyckelharpa), M√°irt√≠n O&#x27;Connor (accordion), Bruce Molsky (fiddle), Rens van der Zalm (fiddle), Rick Epping (harmonica), Paul Moore (double bass), Graham Henderson (keyboards), Liam Bradley (percussion), Jacky Molard (violas, violins and string arrangement), Annbj√∏rg Lien (hardanger fiddles), Lillebj√∏rn Nilsen (guitar), plus Kate Burke and Ruth Hazleton (backing vocals).

====LAPD (Liam/Andy/Paddy/D√≥nal)====

Friday, 20 January 2012 ushered in the inaugural gig, at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street, of a quartet named &#x27;LAPD&#x27; after the initials of its members&#x27; first names: Liam O&#x27;Flynn, Andy Irvine, Paddy Glackin, and D√≥nal Lunny.

They played a set combining tunes and songs from the repertoires of:
* Planxty: &quot;Jenny&#x27;s Wedding/The Virginia/Garrett Barry&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Paddy Canny&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;The Starting Gate&quot;), &quot;The Jolly Beggar/The Wise Maid&quot;, &quot;Arthur MacBride&quot;, &quot;As I Roved Out (Andy)&quot;, &quot;The Blacksmith&quot; and &quot;West Coast of Clare&quot;;
* Irvine &amp; Lunny: &quot;My Heart&#x27;s tonight in Ireland/West Clare Reel&quot;, &quot;Braes of Moneymore&quot;, &quot;Suleiman&#x27;s Kopanitsa&quot;, &quot;The Dream/Indiana&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Donoghue&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Si√∫n Ni Dhuibhir&quot;;
* O&#x27;Flynn &amp; Glackin: &quot;Kitty&#x27;s Rambles/Humours of Ennistymon&quot;, &quot;The Green Island/Bantry Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;Young Tom Ennis/Nora Crean&quot;, &quot;A Rainy Day/The Shaskeen&quot;, &quot;Two Flings&quot;, &quot;Speed the Plough/Colonel Fraser&quot; and &quot;The Gold Ring&quot;.

LAPD performed only occasionally, to rave reviews, but never recorded before disbanding; their last performance took place at Sligo Live, on Saturday, 26 October 2013.

====&quot;70th Birthday Concert at Vicar St 2012&quot;====
On 16 and 17 June 2012, Irvine&#x27;s 70th birthday was celebrated at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street venue in a pair of concerts. He was joined onstage by Paul Brady and various combinations of members of Sweeney&#x27;s Men, Planxty, Mozaik and LAPD, plus brothers George and Manoli Galiatsos who came unexpectedly all the way from Athens for the concerts, which were recorded and released on the CD &quot;Andy Irvine/70th Birthday Concert at Vicar St 2012&quot; and its associated DVD.

====Playing Woody Guthrie again====
A week later, Irvine was invited to participate with Billy Bragg in the &quot;Woody 100 Legacy Show&quot; scheduled at Dublin&#x27;s Vicar Street on Monday, 17 September 2012, to celebrate Woody Guthrie&#x27;s Centenary.

In his web journal, Irvine wrote at the time: &quot;I recently located my old Gibson L0 guitar. It was in the shed where it has been languishing for some years. I used to be able to do a pretty good impression of Woody&#x27;s &#x27;Church lick&#x27; guitar playing. Hope I can get it all back! [...] I&#x27;d better get practising!...&quot;

====&quot;Parachilna&quot; with Rens van der Zalm====
On 13 November 2013, Irvine released his first duo album with Rens van der Zalm: &quot;Parachilna&quot;, an album of Irish and Australian songs recorded live in July 2012 while camping in Parachilna, South Australia and New South Wales.

It was co-produced by Irvine (vocals, bouzouki, mandola and harmonica) and van der Zalm (backing vocals, guitar, mandolin, fiddle and viola), and recorded by Cian Burke in disused buildings using top-quality microphones, a laptop and Pro Tools. Most of the time, there are only two instruments playing‚Äìthree when Irvine also plays harmonica‚Äìand the resulting sound is bright and pristine.

====Usher&#x27;s Island====
On 27 January 2015, Irvine launched his latest musical association at Celtic Connections in Glasgow: a band called Usher&#x27;s Island (a reference to the Dublin quay), with D√≥nal Lunny (guitar, bouzouki, bodhr√°n, keyboards), Paddy Glackin (fiddle), Michael McGoldrick (uilleann pipes, flute and whistle), and John Doyle (guitar).

<text>Campbeltown Loch (Scottish Gaelic: Loch Chille Chiarain) is a small sea loch near the south of the Kintyre Peninsula facing eastwards towards the Firth of Clyde. The town of Campbeltown, from which it takes its name, is located at its head. The island of Davaar is located in the loch, and can be reach by foot along a natural shingle causeway at low tide. Oddly, while in English the Loch takes its name from Campbeltown, in Gaelic, Campbeltown takes its name from the loch - &quot;Ceann Loch Chille Chiarain&quot;.

==English raid of 1558==
In October 1558, the English raided &quot;Loch Kilkerran&quot; because of the activities of the Clan MacDonald in Ireland. The Earl of Sussex sailed from Dublin in the &quot;Mary Willoughby&quot; with a small fleet. They burnt farms and houses including Saddell, a castle of James MacDonald of Dunyvaig and Glynnes (died 1565), and then marched south to burn Dunaverty and Machrimore. He then burnt farms on Arran, Bute, and Cumbrae.

== Campbeltown Shipbuilding Co ==
In 1877 Archibald MacEachern founded a shipyard at Trench Point, at the entrance to the Loch, on what had been 17th century earthworks. Campbeltown Shipbuilding Company Limited, with capital of ¬£60,000, was formed in 1917. The yard closed in 1922, after building 115 ships. Campbeltown Shipyard Ltd, a subsidiary of Lithgows (1969) Ltd, opened on the same site in 1969 and built 101 fishing and other small boats until 1997. In 2009 a slipway, jetty and some buildings remained.

==The song==

The loch is immortalised in the folk song of the same name, repopularized by Andy Stewart in the 1960s. In the song (see below) the writer Alan Cameron expresses his desire that the loch be full of whisky. The basis of that ballad is that Campbeltown was originally a centre of whisky distilling but that the price of whisky in Campbeltown itself was too high.

:Chorus:
:&quot;Oh! Campbeltown Loch, Ah wish ye were whisky!&quot;
:&quot;Campbeltown Loch, Och Aye!&quot;
:&quot;Campbeltown Loch, I wish ye were whisky!&quot;
:&quot;Ah wid drink ye dry.&quot;

:Now Campbeltown Loch is a beautiful place,
:But the price of the whisky is grim.
:How nice it would be if the whisky was free
:And the Loch was filled up to the brim.

:I&#x27;d buy a yacht with the money I&#x27;ve got
:And I&#x27;d anchor it out in the bay.
:If I wanted a nip I&#x27;d go in for a dip
:I&#x27;d be swimmin&#x27; by night and by day.

:We&#x27;d have a gathering of the clans
:They&#x27;d come from near and far
:I can see them grin as they&#x27;re wading in
:And shouting &quot;Sl√†inte mhath!&quot;.

:But what if the boat should overturn
:And drowned in the whisky was I?
:You&#x27;d hear me shout, you&#x27;d hear me call out
:&quot;What a wonderful way to die !&quot;

:But what&#x27;s this I see, ochone for me
:It&#x27;s a vision to make your blood freeze.
:It&#x27;s the police afloat in a dirty great boat
:And they&#x27;re shouting: &quot;Time, gentlemen, please!&quot;

Campbeltown Loch is sung to a march written for the bagpipes, &quot;The Glendaruel Highlanders&quot;.

<text>Warren Hasty Carroll (March 24, 1932 ‚Äì July 17, 2011) was the founder and first president of Christendom College in Front Royal, Virginia. He authored multiple works of Roman Catholic church history.

==Early life and education==
Carroll was born on March 24, 1932, in Maine, the son of Herbert Allen Carroll and Gladys Hasty Carroll, a writer. He received his B.A. in history from Bates College in 1953. He received his M.A. and Ph.D. in history from Columbia University. His younger sister, Sarah Watson, who died one month after Warren in 2011, and both of their parents were also Bates College graduates.

==Career==
Carroll served at one time in the Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s anti-communism division as a Communist propaganda analyst. From 1967 to 1972, he served on the staff of California State Senator and later U.S. Congressman, John G. Schmitz.

A year after his marriage to Anne Westhoff, Carroll converted from Deism to Catholicism in 1968 and began working for the Catholic magazine &quot;Triumph&quot;. In 1977, he founded Christendom College with the help of other Catholic laymen, in particular, William H. Marshner, Jeffrey A. Mirus, Raymund P. O&#x27;Herron, and Kristin M. Burns. He served as the first president of the college, until 1985, and chairman of its History Department until his retirement in 2002.

He helped his wife author &quot;Christ the King, Lord of History&quot;, &quot;Christ in the Americas&quot;, a job that would later prove most beneficial when writing his comprehensive study of international communism, and &quot;Seventy Years of the Communist Revolution&quot;, updated and re-released as &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Communist Revolution&quot;.

Carroll lived in Manassas, Virginia, with his wife Anne, founder of Seton School and Seton Home Study School.

Before his death, he returned to Christendom College each month during the school year to deliver public lectures on select historical topics, ranging from the history of Malta, to Genghis Khan, to the French Revolution, and topics from the 20th century, with lectures on Emperor Karl of Austria and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Carroll remained a member of the board of directors and played an active role in helping to guide the college through the years.

==Death==
Carroll died on July 17, 2011, in Manassas, Virginia, at the age of 79, after a number of years of dealing with the effects of numerous strokes. He was interred at Christendom College in a grave overlooking the Shenandoah River behind the college&#x27;s Regina Coeli Hall. On September 16, 2012, Carroll&#x27;s Celtic cross headstone, which is inscribed with &quot;Truth exists. The Incarnation happened&quot;, was blessed by college chaplain Fr. Donald Planty.

==Awards==
Christendom College, the school he founded, awarded Carroll with an honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1999, its Pro Deo et Patria Award for Distinguished Service to God and Country in 2007, and its inaugural Queen Isabel Catholic Vision of History Award in 2007. The Society of Catholic Social Scientists, an organization of which he was a board member, named him its inaugural recipient of the Pius XI Award in history in 1995.

He published articles through the society&#x27;s periodical, the &quot;Catholic Social Science Review&quot;. Carroll is also known for his major work, the multi-volume &quot;History of Christendom&quot;. At the time of his death, only five volumes had been published; Anne Carroll helped complete the sixth volume, published in the summer of 2013. The series presents a narrative account of Western Civilization and Catholic history from antiquity around 2000 BC through 2010.

<text>Tetsuro Shigematsu (born 1971) is a playwright/performer, filmmaker, comedian, and Canadian radio broadcaster. He was the final host of CBC Radio One&#x27;s former afternoon series &quot;The Roundup&quot;, where he replaced Bill Richardson in 2004, making him the first visible minority to host a daily network radio program in Canada. The show completed its final episode on November 4, 2005. Prior to working for CBC Radio, he was a writer for the Canadian TV show &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot;. He is currently a writer for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, and artist-in-residence at Vancouver Asian Canadian Theatre.

==Early life==
Shigematsu was born in London, England in 1971. His father was from Kagoshima, Japan, and his mother was from Osaka, Japan. His family emigrated to Canada in 1974. He grew up in Surrey, British Columbia, with four siblings, and studied in Montreal. He has a BFA from Concordia University.

In 1991, at the age of 19, Shigematsu became the youngest playwright to compete in the history of the Quebec Drama Festival.

==Career==
From 1993 to 1996, Shigematsu wrote and performed his one-man show &quot;Rising Son&quot; in Montreal, Boston, Los Angeles, and Tokyo. In 1994, Tetsuro studied poetry with Allen Ginsberg. He then spent the following two years in Japan, where he studied Butoh dance with the founding master, Kazu Ohno, in Yokohama, Japan.

In 1996, he starred with George Takei (Star Trek&#x27;s Sulu) in the television movie &quot;Rinko The Best Bad Thing&quot;, based on the novel by Yoshiko Uchida. That same year, Tetsuro began hosting the Montreal Asian Heritage Festival.

In 1997, he created and produced three episodes of &quot;La La Pan-Asia&quot;, a half-hour TV show showcasing Asian youth culture. In 1998, he was awarded a Canada Council grant to write a new play, &quot;The Moons of Tokyo&quot;. In 1999, Shigematsu was invited to be artist-in-residence at Technoboro, an artist-run media lab.

His video work has been seen in the Montreal World Film Festival and the Biosphere and won the Prix du Public at the Ev√©nement Interuniversitaire d&#x27;Art.

In 2007, Shigematsu completed his feature film debut, &quot;Yellow Fellas&quot;, which he wrote and directed.

In 2009, Shigematsu appeared in Episode 2 of the TV series &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot; as one of the experts for the Samurai team. In 2010, he returned for the &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot; &quot;Back for Blood&quot; special, a transition from season one to season two pitting the winning warriors from season one against one another.

In 2011, Shigematsu gave a TEDx talk called &quot;The Awesomeness of Your Contradictions&quot;.

In 2011, Shigematsu began his PhD within the Faculty of Education at the University of British Columbia. He conducts research on social media, with a focus on the rising visibility of diasporic Asians on YouTube, for which he was named a Vanier scholar.

In 2012, Shigematsu began writing for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;.

In 2015, Shigematsu&#x27;s theatrical solo work &quot;Empire of the Son&quot; had its world premiere at The Cultch in Vancouver. The entire run sold out prior to opening, an unprecedented feat for the world premiere of a Canadian play. The Vancouver Sun named it as the best theatre show of 2015. The 2016 remount also sold out its run prior to opening.

In October 2017, Shigematsu&#x27;s next solo work, &quot;1 Hour Photo&quot;, had its world premiere at The Cultch in Vancouver. &quot;1 Hour Photo&quot; was shortlisted for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for English-language drama at the 2019 Governor General&#x27;s Awards.

==Personal life==
Shigematsu speaks English, French, Japanese, and Persian. He has two children.

<text>G. W. Bailey (born August 27, 1944) is an American actor. Although he has appeared in many dramatic roles, he may be best remembered for his &quot;crusty&quot; comedic characters such as Staff Sergeant Luther Rizzo in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (TV series 1979‚Äì1983); Lieutenant/Captain Thaddeus Harris in the &quot;Police Academy&quot; films (1984‚Äì1994), and Captain Felix Maxwell in &quot;Mannequin&quot; (1987). He played the role of Detective Lieutenant Louie Provenza on TNT&#x27;s television crime drama &quot;The Closer&quot;, and its spinoff series &quot;Major Crimes&quot;, from 2005 to 2018.

==Life and career==
Bailey was born in Port Arthur, Texas, where he went to Thomas Jefferson High School with Janis Joplin and Jimmy Johnson. He started college at Lamar University in nearby Beaumont and transferred to Texas Tech University in Lubbock.

Bailey left college and spent the mid-1960s working at local theater companies before moving to California in the mid-1970s. He broke into television with a small recurring role as a crime scene police officer on the short-lived detective show &quot;Harry O&quot;. He then landed one-shot episodic roles on television programs of the day such as &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. His film debut was in &quot;A Force of One&quot; (1979), an early Chuck Norris film. By the late 1970s, he got his breakout role as the conniving, cigar-chomping goldbricker Sgt. Luther Rizzo in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. He also appeared as Tom Berenger&#x27;s sidekick in &quot;Rustler&#x27;s Rhapsody&quot; (1985).

He returned to college in 1993, and graduated from Southwest Texas State University, now Texas State, in San Marcos, Texas in May 1993, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts, Theatre. For the 1999‚Äì2000 school year, he was the Artist-in-Residence.

In the late 1990s, he starred in three of the seventeen television films and miniseries in the &quot;Bible Collection&quot; series produced for the TNT television network: &quot;Solomon&quot; (1997), &quot;Jesus&quot; (1999), and &quot;Paul&quot; (2000).

From 2001 to 2019, Bailey served as the executive director of the Sunshine Kids Foundation, which provides trips and activities for hundreds of young cancer patients annually. He first volunteered with the organization after his goddaughter was diagnosed with leukemia.

<doc id="1092851" wikidata="Q5126424" url="?curid=1092851" title="Clarence Bruce, 3rd Baron Aberdare">
<text>Clarence Napier Bruce, 3rd Baron Aberdare, GBE (2 August 1885 ‚Äì 4 October 1957), styled The Honourable Clarence Bruce from 1895 to 1929, was a British military officer, cricketer, tennis player, and golfer who worked as a sports administrator. He was killed in an automobile accident in 1957 after attending an International Olympic Committee meeting in the Balkans.

==Early life and education==
Bruce was born at 29, Eaton Place, Westminster, the second son of Henry Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare and Constance Mary Beckett.

Bruce received his education at Twyford School, Winchester College and at New College, Oxford, and was admitted as a barrister of the Inner Temple; however, when World War I broke out, he decided to enter the British Army. His elder brother was killed in action in 1914, making him heir apparent to his father&#x27;s barony.

==Career==

Lord Aberdare, who would rise to the substantive rank of captain (and would become an honorary colonel) in World War I, served variously in the Glamorgan Yeomanry, the 2nd Life Guards, the headquarters of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and in the Guards Machine Gun Regiment; in 1919, immediately after the armistice, he was promoted to captain. He inherited the barony in 1929. He served as the honorary colonel of the 77 (later 282) (Welsh) Heavy AA Brigade, RA from 1930 to 1952; during this period, he additionally served as major of the 11th Battalion, Surrey Home Guards during World War II. 
Between the two world wars, he was an active real tennis player. Bruce was U.S.A. Amateur Champion in 1930 and of the British Isles in 1932 and 1938. He played eighteen times for Great Britain in the Bathurst Cup and six times won the Coupe de Paris. He carried off the M.C.C. Gold Prize on five occasions and nine times won the Silver Prize.
In 1937, Aberdare was appointed chairman of the National Fitness Council, the first attempt at a Sports Council in England. It quickly established 22 area committees to help with its aim of promoting a fit population. It was funded by the Department of Education and provided capital grants for new facilities and other grants to help with the appointment of trainers and leaders. It had a difficult two years before being dissolved in October 1939. These included liaison with existing statutory and voluntary organisations. In absorbing the Juvenile Organisations Committee and its local committees it alienated many who had worked towards bridging the gap between recreation provided at school and to the wider community (14‚Äì20 age group). In addition there was much support for compulsory physical training as opposed to the council&#x27;s approach of a voluntary ethos.

Simultaneously, Aberdare played an active role in the organisation of the Olympics; he served on the International Olympic Committee, and on the organising committee of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. He was a key player in the decision to send British athletes to Hitler&#x27;s 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, asserting that &quot;neither nor his colleagues &#x27;had yet heard of a genuine case of an Olympic athlete being boycotted or impeded because of his non-Aryan origin&#x27;&quot;, this despite Nazi Germany&#x27;s overtly stated anti-semitism. He served in many physical education and sportsmen&#x27;s clubs, and was also a member of the New College Society.

In 1948, he was created a Knight of the Order of St John of Jerusalem, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire a year later. In 1954, he was additionally created a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire.

==Marriage and issue==

In 1912, he married Margaret Bethune Black, with whom he had two sons and two daughters:

*Hon. Morys Bruce (1919‚Äì2005), married in 1946 Maud Helen Sarah Dashwood, daughter of Sir John Dashwood, 10th Baronet; succeeded his father as 4th Baron Aberdare
*Hon. Nigel Henry Clarence Bruce (17 June 1921 ‚Äì ), married Catherine Marion Wolfe, daughter of Thomas Wolfe
*Hon. Rosalind Louise Balfour Bruce (11 November 1923 ‚Äì 25 May 2019), married in 1956 Benjamin Coote Heywood
*Hon. Gwyneth Margaret Bruce (3 July 1928 ‚Äì 7 January 2000), married in 1952 Robert McCheyne Andrew

Lady Aberdare died on 8 February 1950.

On 12 September 1957, Aberdare married his second wife, the actress Griselda Hervey, only daughter of Dudley Francis Amelius Hervey. 

==Death==
Shortly after his second marriage, Lord Aberdare and his new wife drove to attend the 53rd Session of the IOC in Sofia, Bulgaria, held from 23 to 28 September. After the IOC meeting finished, they began driving home through Yugoslavia as part of their honeymoon. On 4 October 1957, their car left the road near Risan (now Montenegro) and fell into the Bay of Kotor. Aberdare, aged 72, drowned and his wife, aged 56, was injured.

The repatriation of Lord Aberdare&#x27;s body was arranged by Sir John Lambert at the UK embassy in Belgrade: as coffins were not permitted on passenger flights, Lambert concealed Aberdare&#x27;s body among the cellos of the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra.

<text>The Archaeological Museum of Asturias (Spanish: Museo Arqueol√≥gico de Asturias; Asturian: Mus√©u Arqueol√≥xicu d&#x27;Asturies) is housed in the 16th century Benedictine monastery of Saint Vicente in Oviedo, Asturias, Spain. Its findings include collections of the Asturian Neolithic, Megalithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, Astur hill fort culture, Roman period, and of the Gothic, Pre-Romanesque and Romanesque periods of the Kingdom of Asturias. The museum also includes sections of Asturian Ethnography, Heraldry, Medieval and Modern Epigraphy, Spanish Numismatics, a European Medal Section, and Armor.

While owned by the Spanish State, its management was transferred to the regional administration in 1991.

The museum underwent a series of refurbishment works beginning in 2004, being reinaugurated and reopened to the public on March 21, 2011.

== Notable pieces ==
* Vega del Cielo mosaic
* San Miguel de Lillo altar stone
* Santa Mar√≠a del Naranco altar stone
* 12th-century sarcophagus of Gontrodo P√©rez, lover of King Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and mother of Urraca &quot;la Asturiana.&quot;, Queen of Navarre

== Permanent exhibits ==

The permanent exhibition narrates the history of the Asturian region from prehistory to the High and Late Middle Ages, through the material culture preserved in the museum, giving us a view of the different peoples that have inhabited this territory over its many centuries of history.

===Prehistoric Times===
Archaeological investigations have revealed the subsistence strategies (hunting, fishing and foraging) and technical advances in the manufacture of tools of the prehistoric people who occupied caves and shelters near rivers. Of particular note is the presentation of the world of the Neanderthals, provided by the latest discoveries in the Asturian cave of El Sidr√≥n. The enigmatic universe of the different mindsets finds its most eloquent expression in Paleolithic parietal art and furniture. In Asturias, images of great beauty are to be found in nearly fifty caves, where our remotest ancestors carved or painted animals, symbols and summary representations of the human body.

===Neolithic to Metal Ages===
From the Neolithic up through the Bronze Age, a drastic cultural change occurred as compared to the traditional way of life of Paleolithic societies. The people that populated our region about 4,500 years ago felled forests, cleared the first fields for crops and opened up areas of pasture land for raising animals. Megaliths, with their ritualistic and territorial significance, became a part of the Asturian landscape as a reflection of the complex new agricultural society. The intensive exploitation of copper mines and the expansion of the metallurgical phenomenon led to the development of increasingly complex societies. During this period, Asturias began its long history as a mining region.

===Era of the Castros===
The castros (fortified settlements) nowadays constitute one of the most visible elements of the Asturian landscape, the typical habitat in Asturias between the end of the Bronze Age and Roman settlement, i.e., during the Iron Age. The castros had an autonomous nature, with the defenses being the most outstanding boundary element, emblematic of these communities that appeared to be quite dissociated and divided into clans.

===Rome in Asturias===

With the arrival of Rome to the distant lands bordering the Bay of Biscay in the times of the emperor Augustus, Asturias became part of the Roman Empire. Under Roman rule, the territory became truly unified due to the creation of both urban and rural centers connected by an extensive network of roads. Profit from the gold mines focused Rome&#x27;s attention on the western area of the region, exploiting deposits on a large scale. New economic and trade activities arose throughout the country, bringing about a change in the habits and customs of a traditionally mining and agricultural population. The presence of Rome in Asturias also marked our region&#x27;s entrance into the cultural spheres of the classical world.

===Medieval Asturias===

The Kingdom of Asturias inaugurated the Middle Ages in this region. Royal sites, churches, monasteries and castles comprised the main centers of power of the monarchy and the early medieval aristocracy. However, most of the rural population lived in modest houses with simple household furnishings in small villages. The art of the Astur monarchy is noted for its architectural and ornamental originality. From the 13th century on, new urban centers and towns (Asturian polas) concentrated the population and centralized administrative, trade and craft activities. New Romanesque and Gothic churches were built in these cities, towns and villages. Towards the end of medieval times, there emerged a new aristocracy which played a major role in the political, economic and social life of the region.

Completing the exhibition a specific section entitled ‚ÄúFrom Collection to Museum‚Äù, which looks at how the museum came to be, its history running almost parallel to the beginnings of scientific archeology in the region.

In an annex to this thematic area is a tribute to the figure of Friar Benito Feijoo y Montenegro, extraordinary figure of the Spanish Enlightenment and abbot of the Monastery of San Vicente. A Benedictine cell has been reconstructed in the grandest part of the old cloister, just like the one found in the museum&#x27;s former exhibition. In this way, we continue to recognize the most prolific essayist of the 18th century, whose intellectual work marked a milestone in the evolution of thought and science of that time.

Another section is devoted to the dissemination and appreciation of World Heritage sites in Asturias: Paleolithic cave art and monuments of the Asturian monarchy. Through a series of interactive screens and audiovisuals, visitors are given relevant information on these heritage sites as well as the various archaeological routes that can be taken to enjoy this cultural legacy.

== The collection ==

The confiscation of church property in 1837 put a great number of religious works of art into circulation and throughout the 19th century the Asturian Commission on Monuments took on the task of collecting the remains of those abandoned and sold-off monasteries and churches. These pieces constituted the source of the Museum of Antiquities‚Äô collection, which gradually grew through the donations made by several of its members, as well as by collectors and scholars concerned with the past.

In its active work, the museum was mainly involved in the restoration of pre-Romanesque churches, collecting pieces from the ruins of some of these buildings. Once in the 20th century, the development of scientific archeology meant expanding the horizon towards prehistoric times, after Palaeolithic cave art was discovered in Asturias.

Throughout the 20th century, the museum&#x27;s collection grew significantly as the result of archaeological excavations in Asturias. Private collections were also donated, adding to the holdings of the former Commission on Monuments. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the Provincial Government of Oviedo purchased a variety of wooden statues, furniture and other objects. Major purchases included three collections: that of the heirs of Soto Cort√©s, comprising all kinds of archaeological artifacts; the numismatic collection belonging to Pedro Hurl√© Mans√≥; and the collection of arms and coins from the heirs of Tom√°s Fern√°ndez Bataller.

Research carried out since the 1970s has steadily expanded the museum&#x27;s collection from the Paleolithic Age, the Metal Ages and the Roman period. The birth of archeology management, which has developed significantly since the 1990s, has led to a great deal of material from all ages being incorporated. This especially includes objects from the Middle Ages, collected from the historic centers of Asturian cities and towns, as well as from the numerous churches and monasteries which have been examined prior to their restoration.

==Library==
The library of the Archaeological Museum of Asturias is the centre of documentation of the museum in Oviedo, Spain. It deals with the attention services for the study and investigation of the prehistoric times and archaeology in the Asturias. The library preserves a specialized fund in prehistorical times and archaeology in relation with the collections of the museum. It also has an automated catalogue of the funds and a reading room.

The Library has been from the beginning an important piece for the museum, which since the middle of the 19th century to the current days, has experienced a deep transformation, and an internal renewal that has its reflection in the management of its collections as in the management of the information.

===Objectives===

The basic objectives are:
* Upgrade the museum.
* Collect, sort, classify, catalog and register in a management system and spread all the information of interest for the study, analysis and investigation of the possessions deposited in the museum.
* Conserve and preserve its documentary collections.
* Integrate in the documentation area its archives and library which are the main axis of the information sources of the museum.
* Spread the funds for its enhancement, through publications and especially through websites.
* Establish relations of cooperation and collaboration with other institutions.
* Update, by using technologies, the services that it offers to the users through its website.

===Physical space===

The library is located between the first and second floor of the museum. The access is made through the ancient stairs of the monastery. The space is distributed in two great areas: one of them dedicated to query, and the other one to the deposit. The query area has seven seats for reading, in which users can consult the funds of the bibliographic collection and the archive. The Internet access is available, and it also has a computer in case of need of reprographic printing. This space also completes with a working zone for the library staff.

The library is free to access and it offers the service of query from Monday to Friday, so the problem of the restricted access to the public, kept since a lot of years, is resolved. The library is also a polyvalent place, where it can be celebrated meetings and didactic workshops.

===Collection===

The library is specialized in archaeology, prehistory, ancient history and medieval history, with a special reference to Asturias. Its catalogue is integrated in the Collective Catalogue of the Network of Libraries of Asturias and its query can be done through the Collective Catalogue of the Libraries of Asturias. The bibliographic collection possesses a great chronological amplitude, that goes from 1650 to actuality. The documentary typology is varied and although the weight is made by monographs and magazines, it also has cartographic material, images, audiovisual supports, drawings, plates, pictures, posters and manuscripts. The main linguistic coverage is the Spanish but it also has English, French and Italian publications. It is formed by 15.000 volumes. The bibliographic collection is grouped in several sections individualized by its thematic, typology or origin. 
* HISTORICAL FUND or LIBRARY of the CPMHA. It constitutes an own section, and it is known as the Library of the Commission. It is formed by near 3.500 registers, gathered from 1844 to 1952 which answer to the interests of the institution, in a determinate period and by those who were at the top of the shopping and acquisitions (Ciriaco Miguel Vigil, Ferm√≠n Canella, Fortunato de Selgas, Rafael Altamira, etc.). It predominates the following matters: epigraphy, numismatist, antiquities, classical archaeology, history of art, medals, ivories, fine arts, Asturian subjects, etc. The majority were printed between 1870 and 1930 and the origin is diverse. it entered by purchase, by donation of its author or possessor and by exchange between history institutions, local studies or of provincial museums. There are French editions of art encyclopedias, of classical art, antiquities, editions on the first archaeologic excavations in the 19th century, and the main works of the 19th century in matter of prehistory and archaeology. It conserves an extraordinary work: Architectural Monuments of Spain, considered the most ambitious project from the bibliographic point of view of ones tackled in Spain. This work was printed to study and spread the artistical heritage of the country, specially the Asturian. It was published under the direction of a special commission created by the Ministerio de Fomento, between 1856 and 1881. In its graphic part it was employed with big precision the technics of the intaglio, the lithography and the cromolitograf√≠a. Also it stands out factitious editions that gather documents and varied brochures, grouped by subjects of interest: Subjects of Asturias, political Writings, History, etc. There are documents of interest written in Asturian language, that allowed the study of this language: loose leaves, poems and manuscripts. And also handwritten texts, speeches, sermons, letters, and historical documentation. Other curious materials that integrate the collection of the library are ephemeral and difficult to achieve materials like brochures, small format publications, posters, loose leaves, etc.
* GENERAL FUND. The general fund of the library is formed by monographs and reference works. There are about 9.000 volumes that covers all the areas of knowledge, although history and art are the most represented, specially referred to Asturias. The typologies are varied: manuals, memories of archaeological excavations, catalogues of exhibitions, museums, records of congresses, thesis, tesinas, homages, etc. The Archaeologic Museum of Asturias has the function, conferred by the Law 1/2001 of Cultural Heritage, of protect all the rests and archaeological objects that are exhumed in the excavations that makes the Princedom of Asturias. It also has the obligation to carry out the promotion of the investigation and Asturian archaeology. In relation with this function, in the collection abound the Excavations Memories and the monographic studies of archeological sites that attract many requests of query from users. Since the 1980s, the increase of the management archaeology and the projects and archaeologic plans, as well as the interventions of conservation and monument restoration in all the country, propitiated a big development of publications that collects the plans and memories. Cultural Heritage services of each region develop and issue publications and newsletters with this detailed information for its diffusion, as the result of a lot of archeological sites needs years of excavation campaigns.
* PERIODIC PUBLICATIONS. It has an important collection formed by of 152 titles in permanent growth. A great part of the fund enters through the agreements of exchange, with more than 70 Spanish and foreign institutions. Some are previous to 1900, like the &quot;Bulletin of the Academy of the History&quot;, the &quot;Bulletin of the Spanish Society of Excursions&quot; : Art, Archaeology, History or the &quot;Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Saint Fernando&quot;, &quot;The Galician and Asturian illustration&quot;, the Magazine of Archives, Libraries and Museums, etc. During the first 30 years of the 20th century, the most frequent titles are, between others, &quot;Revue of synth√®se historique&quot;, Upper Board of &quot;Excavations and Antiquities&quot;, &quot;Museum&quot; : monthly magazine of ancient and modern Spanish art and of the contemporary artistic life. Since 1944 there is a strong worry to keep alive the collections and acquire new titles, which enters by purchase. Magazines of institutions that have established exchange agreements, enters by donation, ensuring its continuity: &quot;Artistic Historical bulletin of Lugo&quot;, &quot;Hispanic Archaeologic Record&quot;, &quot;Annals of the Museum of the Spanish Village&quot;, &quot;Spanish Archive of Archaeology&quot;, &quot;Hispanic Archaeologic Newscast&quot; etc. However, in the last years, the economic crisis affected a lot the budget items for the editions in paper, so since the last three or four years, it is frequent the query of digital magazines through the website of the institutions.
* OTHER MATERIALS. In the library is also deposited the Archive of CPMHA with documentation from 1840, that occupies 30 files. It also has ancient photographs, drawings, diplomas, pictures, plates, local newspapers, etc. The modern images&#x27; archive of the museum, houses an approximate collection of 5.000 photographies of pieces and archaeological materials.

== Services ==
The library of the Archaeologic Museum is today different from what it was some years ago, and no precisely for its bibliographic fund, but for the service provided. it has become a space for the researchers community. In the same way that museums are no longer institutions that accumulate and classify objects, libraries are not book warehouses for the exclusive use of the conservatives.

== History ==
===History of the museum===
The precedent for the current museum lies in the Provincial Commission on Monuments, created in 1845, which carried out the first actions to protect the monuments and cultural heritage of Asturias, opening the first museum in 1870 in the Convent of San Francisco, which has since ceased to exist, with pieces collected throughout the Asturian region as well as from private donations.

The current museum dates from 1944, although it was not opened to the public until 1952 in the cloister of the former Monastery of San Vicente. The collection has since grown due to excavations, donations and purchases of pieces. Given the condition of the building, in 1998 the Ministry of Culture started the process of refurbishing and expanding the museum. Works to carry out the project designed by architects Fernando Pardo Calvo and Bernardo Garc√≠a Tapia were begun in 2004. After an investment of 16 million euros, the remodeling has increased the museum&#x27;s gross floor area to 5,810 m¬≤, of which 2,013 m¬≤ are dedicated to its permanent exhibition.

At the same time, these works led to the discovery of a 1.6 m-high bastion from the original 8th-century wall that surrounded Oviedo. The arcades of the cloister rest on the remains of this city wall. The initial project for the works had to be modified to leave these parts of the wall exposed as yet another of the museum&#x27;s treasures. The find supports historian Juan Ur√≠a R√≠u&#x27;s hypothesis regarding the course of this wall, erected in the times of Alfonso II.

===History of the library===
The library of the Archaeological Museum of Asturias was born with the Provincial Commission of Monuments, an organism created by the real Order of July 24, 1844. After the desamortizaci√≥n of the ecclesiastical possessions in 1836, it was necessary to organize a public system in order to protect the buildings and artistic objects that had become property of the State. It had the objective of the conserving cultural heritage, gathering data of the buildings, monuments and antiquities worthy of conservation, and also caring for books, documents, pictures, statues, medals, etc.

To know the life of the library, we have to follow the life of the museum marked by successive headquarters and events.

====The Library in times of the COMMISSION MUSEUM (1844‚Äì1878)====
The first collection was gathered 150 years ago and it started as an auxiliary library. It has been taken care by the University of Oviedo librarian Manuel de Prado y Tov√≠a, encharged in 1854, and later by Aquilino Su√°rez B√°rcena. In 1868, it was allocated, as the first building to house the collection of the museum and the library, the Chapel of the Third Order of the Convent of San Francisco of Oviedo whose reform and installation was prolonged for seven years.

====The Library in times of the ANTIQUITIES MUSEUM (1878‚Äì1918)====
On September 21, 1878, Day of Saint Mateo, the museum was opened with a simple installation, a total space of 124 m2. The Library was an attention focus in the museum, as it said Fermin Canella Secades in 1882: &quot;it has enriched enough in these last years, with books of history, archaeology, fine arts, etc., and between these, we found the remarkable publication of architectural Monuments of Spain and a special section of works, brochures and historical asturian papers&quot;.

Of this headquarters it moved in 1889 to the Normal Schools, with a space of , formed by a playground and two rooms, one of them destined to archive and library and the other, to a living room of sessions. In 1902 the library opened to the public and to the loan, it turns into a circulating library. But the Normal Schools needed more space, so the library moved again.

====The Library in times of the PROVINCIAL MUSEUM (1918‚Äì1951)====
The building assigned in 1918 was provisional, and it was the low floor of the Dean&#x27;s house, Benigno Rodr√≠guez Pajares, in the plazuela de la Corrada del Obispo. From this moment the library, the archive and the collection of pieces of the museum remained there with restricted access; this situation propitiated the fact that the building did not suffer extreme damage by the violent attacks of the Revolution of October, in 1934 and the Civil War. In 1939, the Deputation took care of the reconstruction and restoration of the building of the Benedictine Monastery of Saint Vicente, the final site for the museum, with a work commissioned by the architect Luis Men√©ndez-Pidal.
====The Library in times of the PROVINCIAL ARCHAEOLOGIC MUSEUM (1952‚Äì2003)====
On San Mateo&#x27;s day, in 1952 it was inaugurated the museum. In this new place, the library occupied an important place as the institution required. The control of the library is the director&#x27;s function, as well as the management of the museum&#x27;s collection. As well as the acquired funds, the library initiated a new stage with the deposit of bibliographic funds. With this new stage, it established relationships with national and foreign entities for the exchange of bulletins and qualified publications. In 1972 disappeared the commission and its functions were integrated by the Deputation. The competences of the Provincial Museum, were transferred in 1991 to the Government of the Asturias Princedom.
====The Library in time of the ARCHAEOLOGIC MUSEUM OF ASTURIAS. (2011‚Äì)====
After 8 years of closing and of internal work, on March 21, 2011, the Archaeologic Museum of Asturias reopened to the public in its historical headquarters, rehabilitated and expanded with a building of new plant. The museum, besides, endows of a modern permanent exhibition and of a group of public equipment and interns that will allow the suitable operation of the institution. With the renewal of the museum could say that the library incorporates to the modernity. The library opened to the public, its catalogues were accessible in the network and its historical bottoms have begun to digitalize.

== The building ==
Since 1952, the museum has occupied the cloister of the former Monastery of San Vicente, a building with a complex history related to the origin of the city. The cloister was declared a national monument in 1934

The Monastery of San Vicente is believed to have been founded in 761, during the reign of Fruela I. Only remnants of that first building have survived. However, the cloister, begun in the 1530s under the direction of master builder Juan de Badajoz, the Younger and completed by Juan de Cerecedo, the Elder and Juan de Cerecedo, the Younger in the 1570s, remains standing.

<text>Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (; n√©e Blank; ‚Äì ) was the mother of Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, who in 1922 founded the Soviet Union.

She was born in Saint Petersburg as Maria Alexandrovna Blank, one of six children. Her father, Alexandr Dmitrievich Blank, was a well-to-do physician. Some researchers argue that he was a Jewish convert to Orthodox Christianity, while others say he was actually the descendant of German colonists invited to Russia by Catherine the Great. There is evidence that he was a Jewish convert to Christianity and that he was born as Srul Moshevich Blank also spelled Israil Moiseevich Blank. However, some historians argue this was another man by a similar name. Her mother, Anna Ivanovna Groschopf, was the daughter of a German-Swedish father, Johan Groschopf, and a Swedish Lutheran mother, Anna √ñstedt. 

In 1838, Ulyanova&#x27;s mother died and her father turned to his sister-in-law, Ekaterina von Essen, to help raise the children. Together they bought a country estate near Kazan and moved the family there.

Ulyanova was educated at home, studying German, French and English as well as Russian and Western literature. In 1863, she took an external degree and became an elementary school teacher. However, she would go on to dedicate most of her life to raising her children. 

After marrying Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov, an upwardly mobile teacher of mathematics and physics, the couple lived in moderate prosperity in Penza. Later, they moved to Nizhny Novgorod and then Simbirsk, where Ulyanov took up a prestigious position as an inspector of primary schools.

Ulyanova displayed a courage and firmness in the face of tragedies and misfortunes that would haunt her family during her lifetime, namely: the deaths of her infant children, Olga and Nikolai, in 1869 and 1873, respectively; the death of her husband in 1886; the execution of her son, Aleksandr, in 1887; the death of her daughter, Olga, in 1891; and the multiple arrests and exiles of the rest of her children ‚Äì Vladimir, Anna, Dmitry and Maria.

She went abroad twice to meet with Vladimir Lenin (to France in the summer of 1902 and Stockholm in the fall of 1910).

==Family==
She was married to Ilya Ulyanov from 1863 until his death in 1886. They had eight children, two of whom died as infants.
* Anna (1864 ‚Äì 1935)
* Aleksandr (1866 ‚Äì 1887)
* Olga (1868 ‚Äì 1869)
* Vladimir (1870 ‚Äì 1924)
* Olga (1871 ‚Äì 1891)
* Nikolai (1873 ‚Äì 1873)
* Dmitri (1874 ‚Äì 1943)
* Maria (1878 ‚Äì 1937)

<text>In physics, lattice field theory is the study of lattice models of quantum field theory. This involves studying field theory on a space or spacetime that has been discretised onto a lattice.

==Details==
Although most lattice field theories are not exactly solvable, they are immensely appealing due to their feasibility for computer simulation, often using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. One hopes that, by performing simulations on larger and larger lattices, while making the lattice spacing smaller and smaller, one will be able to recover the behavior of the continuum theory as the continuum limit is approached. 

Just as in all lattice models, numerical simulation provides access to field configurations that are not accessible to perturbation theory, such as solitons. Similarly, non-trivial vacuum states can be identified and examined. 

The method is particularly appealing for the quantization of a gauge theory using the Wilson action. Most quantization approaches maintain Poincar√© invariance manifest but sacrifice manifest gauge symmetry by requiring gauge fixing. It&#x27;s only after renormalization that gauge invariance can be recovered. Lattice field theory differs from these in that it keeps manifest gauge invariance, but sacrifices manifest Poincar√© invariance‚Äîrecovering it only after renormalization. The articles on lattice gauge theory and lattice QCD explore these issues in greater detail.

<text>Wickford is a town and civil parish in the south of the English county of Essex, with a population of 33,486. Located approximately 30 miles (50¬†km) east of London, it is within the Borough of Basildon along with the original town of Basildon, Billericay, Laindon and Pitsea. 

Wickford has a main high street which includes a wide range of shops. It also has a swimming pool, library, open-air market and a community centre within the vicinity of the town centre.

== History ==
Wickford has a history going back over two thousand years. There is evidence that the area itself was inhabited in prehistoric times probably by a tribe of Britons called Trinovantes. There was a Roman military marching camp on the Beauchamps Farm site, which was succeeded by a Roman villa. This is now the site of Beauchamps High School. This area on higher ground was the historic core of Wickford, the site of the manor house and the parish church of St Catherine&#x27;s. Over time, the commercial centre of Wickford has migrated westwards towards the modern High Street on the other side of the River Crouch.

The place name &#x27;Wickford&#x27; is first attested in a Saxon charter of 995, where it appears as &quot;Wicford&quot;; it appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Wincfort&quot;. The name means &#x27;ford by a wych elm or ford by a dairy-farm&#x27;.

Before the 20th century, Wickford was an agricultural village. At the time of the Domesday Survey, six land-holders were recorded. Historically, there have been only two considerable estates in Wickford: the manor of Wickford Hall and the manor of Stilemans. Robert Wikeford or de Wickford (c.1320‚Äì90), Archbishop of Dublin, was born in Wickford and his family are thought to have been Lords of the Manor of Wickford Hall.

===Governance===
Wickford was an ancient parish in the county of Essex and, from 1894, had a parish council. In 1934, the parish council was abolished when the town became part of Billericay Urban District. The civil parish was re-created on 1 April 2022. The first town councillors took office following an uncontested election in May 2022, and the council held its first meeting on 16 May 2022 at the Wick Community Centre.

=== American relations ===
The village of Wickford in Rhode Island, United States, is believed to have been named after this town.

Wickford was also the English birthplace of Elizabeth Reade (1615‚Äì72), the second wife of John Winthrop the Younger (1606‚Äì76), Governor of Connecticut; she was also a step-daughter of Hugh Peter (1598‚Äì1660), a prominent supporter of the Parliamentary cause during the English Civil War.

=== Naturism ===
Wickford became the birthplace of Naturism in the United Kingdom; in 1924, the English Gymnosophist Society was formed and had its home in the town.

=== Second World War ===
During the Second World War, the edge of the town was hit by a German doodlebug and, on 6 December 1944, a V-2 rocket fell in Branksome Avenue, about a mile west of the town centre. Around the town, in amongst the hedgerows and fields, there are numerous pillboxes constructed as a part of British anti-invasion preparations.

=== 1958 flood ===
In 1958, Wickford town centre was hit by a flood which made national news headlines. The most striking image of the flood was a double-decker bus, left stranded at Halls Corner overnight, partly submerged by the floodwater. A second flood, in 1960, meant that changes were made to the course of the River Crouch; this included turning the river into a concrete channel through the centre of the town, although this may be removed in the coming years, depending on the scale of the Wickford Masterplan (see below).

== Geography ==
For the most part, Wickford is flat and above sea level. The highest point, on the outskirts of the town, is above sea level. The River Crouch flows through the town, from the west to the east. The River Wick flows into the River Crouch from the south.

The built-up area of Wickford extends into the neighbouring parishes of Runwell to the north and Shotgate to the east. 

===Wick Country Park===
The Wick Country Park comprises of former agricultural land, with over 2¬†km (1 1/4 miles) of easy access trails around the site. The trails leads visitors past old hedgerows, the lake, ponds, World War II pillboxes and recent woodland plantings; bridges and boardwalks allow the trails to continue over the North Benfleet brook.

In addition, the Crouch Valley line has services between Wickford and Southminster.

Greater Anglia manages the station and operates all of its passenger services.

===Roads===
The town can be reached easily via the A127, which connects east London and Southend-on-Sea, and by the A130 from Chelmsford.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC London and ITV London which is received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter. BBC East and ITV Anglia can also be received from the Sudbury TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are on BBC Essex on 95.3 FM, Heart East on 96.3 FM, and Gateway 97.8, a community based radio station which broadcast from Basildon on 97.8 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, Southend Echo.

==The Master Plan==
The Wickford Masterplan was first unveiled at the Wickford Community Centre in December 2004 and published in November 2005 by DTZ Pieda Consulting, at a budget of ¬£125¬†million, and many of the developments are currently in progress. At the heart of the proposals is the redevelopment of the High Street, which will be redesigned to be the town&#x27;s premier meeting place. The Masterplan would create new public spaces, enhance the retail environment through the renewal of retail floor space and bring the market into the street scene, promoting urban living above shops and on the existing market site.

Adjacent to the River Crouch, a number of high quality residential developments promoted as the &quot;Town Centre Riverside Living&quot; complex would revitalise the riverside as a public asset and promotion of new eating and drinking opportunities. In addition, a new residential development to the west of Market Avenue will be constructed.

Promoting the station entrances on both sides of the railway line as key gateways to Wickford are also key areas of the plan, which would enhance transport interchange facilities and bring forward the car park site on Station Road for development as a new multi-storey car park and mixed-use development. As of present only the northern side of the station facing The Broadway is easily accessible, with the southern London-bound track only accessible from the outside though a small out-of-way footpath from Market Avenue as a courteous entrance for wheelchair-using passengers.

Public and health services would be improved under the scheme, with the re-organisation of existing health, library and community services into a new &#x27;iconic&#x27; building to the east of Market Avenue as an integrated community service facility.

The Eastern Extension would create a better presence and new linkages to the east of the town centre by redeveloping the car park into a multi-storey development with residential and live-work uses and a new housing scheme to the east of Wickford Bypass. The Southern Gateway area, which surrounds London Road and the southern end of the High Street, are also planned to undergo a transition with a strong leisure and recreational theme, building on existing eating and drinking facilities and incorporating compatible residential uses.

Overall 650 apartments are planned to be built as part of the Masterplan as officially stated by councillor Tony Ball, although other sources opposed to the project claim this figure is closer to 735.

===Opposition===
The Masterplan has met with resistance with many residents of Wickford, mainly due to overall cost, and also the fear from some older residents that raising the level of the river could see repeats of the floods in 1958 and 1960.

There have also been criticism over the number of developments being constructed, which some say threaten to overdevelop and cause environmental and aesthetic damage to the town centre whilst providing minimal improvements to public services; one such group is the Wickford Action Group who has campaigned against many of the revisions made prior to the public approval of the plan.

===Progress===
Construction began in earnest in February 2007, which saw the demolition of many of the buildings in Lower Southend Road to make way for a new residential area. As of December 2009 this development has been partially completed (Riverside Place phase 1 + Riverside Court), however the compulsory purchase order of the post sorting office has been withdrawn leaving the fate of Riverside Place Phase 2 in doubt.

As of April 2010, the whole of the Masterplan project is facing serious delays and construction has halted due to the global financial crisis. In May 2009 the construction company Bradgate Developments released a statement assuring residents the project was still on track.

==Proposed super-max prison==
Plans to build a prison capable of accommodating up to 1,500 inmates on land formerly of the Runwell Hospital mental institute were scrapped. The land is now a housing estate.

<text>Vicki Gabereau (born May 31, 1946) is a Canadian radio and television personality, best known for her longtime association with CBC Radio and her television talk show which aired on CTV from 1997 to 2005.

==Biography==
Vicki Frances Filion was born in Vancouver. Her father&#x27;s best friend, author Pierre Berton, was influential in her life, exposing Gabereau to the greatest intellectuals and stars of the 1950s and 1960s.

Gabereau moved to Toronto at age 18 for university. While there she married Michel Gabereau and worked a variety of jobs, including working as a professional clown at Puck Rent-a-Fool. In that capacity, she ran for Mayor of Toronto in the 1974 municipal election under the pseudonym &quot;Rosy Sunrise&quot;. She then worked in radio, hosting her first talk show for a station in Brampton, Ontario in 1975. She later joined the CBC as an archivist, and became host of CBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Variety Tonight&quot; in 1981.

She won an ACTRA Award for Best Radio Host or Interviewer at the 13th ACTRA Awards in 1984, for her work on &quot;Variety Tonight&quot;. She was also nominated, but did not win, at the 12th ACTRA Awards in 1983, and at the 14th ACTRA Awards in 1985.

In 1985, after the cancellation of &quot;Variety Tonight&quot; she became host of &quot;Gabereau&quot;, a daily interview show. The show aired in the same time slot as &quot;Variety Tonight&quot; for its first season. In January 1986 she announced that she would be leaving the show at the end of the season to pursue other interests; she was ultimately convinced to change her mind and remain with the network, although her show moved to a weekly airing on Saturdays and its nightly time slot was taken over by Stan Carew&#x27;s new &quot;Prime Time&quot;. It returned to daily airing again in 1988 as an afternoon show.

She was one of the CBC&#x27;s most popular and beloved hosts until her departure in 1997, when she moved to CTV, for which she hosted a television talk show, &quot;The Vicki Gabereau Show&quot;, for eight seasons.

Her radio program was replaced in the fall of 1997 by &quot;Richardson&#x27;s Roundup&quot;, hosted by Bill Richardson. She published an autobiography, &quot;This Won&#x27;t Hurt a Bit&quot;, and a cookbook collecting some of her favourite recipes sent in by her CBC radio listeners.

In 2005, she was named by ACTRA as the recipient of its John Drainie Award for lifetime achievement in Canadian broadcasting.

In 2013, it was announced that a retired Gabereau had partnered with a childhood friend to launch a shoe company called VG Shoes.

She makes regular fundraising appearances on the Knowledge Network and is a three-time ACTRA Award winner for best radio host-interviewer.

She has two children, Morgan Gabereau and Eve Gabereau, a step-daughter and five grandchildren.

He made his film debut in &quot;Reckless&quot; (1984), and has starred in over 80 feature films, including &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; (1985), &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), &quot;Stakeout&quot; (1987), &quot;All My Sons&quot; (1987), &quot;Avalon&quot; (1990), &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot; (1993), &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), &quot;Mary Shelley&#x27;s Frankenstein&quot; (1994), &quot;Michael Collins&quot; (1996), &quot;Practical Magic&quot; (1998), &quot;Song for a Raggy Boy&quot; (2003), &quot;Wild Child&quot; (2008) and &quot;Unknown&quot; (2011). He also played Captain Thomas &quot;Tommy&quot; Gregson on the CBS television series &quot;Elementary&quot; (2012‚Äì19).

Quinn has received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performances in the television films &quot;An Early Frost&quot; (1985) and &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; (2007). Highly active in Irish cinema as well as in the United States, Quinn is a four-time Irish Film and Television (IFTA) Award nominee, winning Best Supporting Actor in a Film for the Conor McPherson film &quot;The Eclipse&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Quinn was born in Chicago, Illinois, to Irish Catholic parents. He was raised in Chicago and Rockford, Illinois, as well as in Dublin and Birr, County Offaly, Ireland. His mother, Teresa, was a homemaker, but also worked as a bookkeeper and in the travel business, and his father, Michael Quinn, was a professor of English literature at Rock Valley College. When he was nineteen and working as a roofer, Quinn realized he wanted to become an actor. He trained at the Piven Theatre Workshop.

He has three brothers and a sister. His older brother, Declan Quinn, is a cinematographer, and his younger sister, Marian, is an actress, director and writer. His brother Paul, an actor and director, died in 2015 at the age of 55.

==Career==
His first significant film role was in &quot;Reckless&quot;, followed by a breakthrough role in &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; as the character &quot;Dez&quot; (the love interest of the character played by Rosanna Arquette). Quinn next starred in the controversial television film &quot;An Early Frost&quot;, about a young gay lawyer dying of AIDS (it was broadcast on NBC on November 11, 1985, and co-starred Gena Rowlands, Ben Gazzara and Sylvia Sidney). He received his first Emmy Award nomination for the role. He made a short, well received contribution as Robert De Niro&#x27;s brother in &quot;The Mission&quot;. He played escaped convict Richard &quot;Stick&quot; Montgomery in the action comedy &quot;Stakeout&quot; opposite Richard Dreyfuss and Emilio Estevez.

In 1988, Quinn lost the role of Jesus Christ when Paramount Pictures dropped the distribution rights to the Martin Scorsese movie &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. When Universal Pictures picked up the film, the role went to Willem Dafoe. In the meantime, Quinn starred as the protagonist in the film &quot;Crusoe&quot;, finished in 1989.

During the 1990s, he appeared in &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot;, &quot;Benny &amp; Joon&quot;, &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;, &quot;Haunted&quot; and &quot;Practical Magic&quot;. He also starred in &quot;Michael Collins&quot;, &quot;Song for a Raggy Boy&quot;, &quot;This Is My Father&quot;, and &quot;Evelyn&quot;. He had a cameo appearance as the captain of a doomed Arctic vessel in the Francis Ford Coppola-produced adaptation of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

In 2000, Quinn portrayed Paul McCartney in the VH1 television drama &quot;Two of Us&quot;.

Quinn played Kerry Max Cook in the 2005 movie &quot;The Exonerated&quot;, a true story about people on death row who had been freed.

Quinn played the main character on the NBC drama &quot;The Book of Daniel&quot; in 2006. After the first three weeks of its run, the show was canceled, and its last five episodes never aired. In 2007, Quinn received his second Emmy nomination for the television movie &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;.

In 2010, he played a cameo role as William Rainsferd in the French-made film &quot;Sarah&#x27;s Key&quot;, set during World War II.

He starred as Dermot opposite Taylor Schilling (Abby) in the Canadian-Irish drama film &quot;Stay&quot; (2013).

Quinn co-starred in the CBS Television series &quot;Elementary&quot;.

==Personal life==

In 1987, Quinn married his &quot;Stakeout&quot; co-star Elizabeth Bracco (sister of actress Lorraine Bracco). They have two daughters: Mia (b. 1998) and Ava Eileen (b. 1989), who has autism. Ava appeared as the baby &quot;David&quot; in &quot;Avalon&quot;, and Mia played a ghost in &quot;The Eclipse&quot;. He has controversially suggested that the MMR vaccine led to his daughter&#x27;s autism diagnosis. Former residents of Englewood, New Jersey, Quinn and his family now live in Palisades, Rockland County, New York, and Marbletown in the Catskills / Woodstock region of Ulster County, New York.

As an avid sports fan, Quinn supports the Chicago Cubs, the Green Bay Packers, Michael Jordan, Rory McIlroy, and Roger Federer.

Quinn is also an outspoken critic of Donald Trump.

==Philanthropy==
Quinn has participated in charity golf events for the East Lake Foundation, a community redevelopment program, and Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s &quot;One for the Boys&quot; campaign about testicular cancer awareness. In 2010, Quinn attended a premiere benefit screening of &quot;A Shine of Rainbows&quot; for the International Children&#x27;s Media Center (ICMC) and The American Ireland Fund (AIF). In 1991, he read a segment from Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; as part of MTV&#x27;s &quot;&quot; literacy promotion PSAs.

Quinn spoke at the 2003 &quot;Night of Too Many Stars&quot; gala benefiting The Autism Coalition. He was an honorary board member of the National Alliance for Autism Research (NAAR), which merged with Autism Speaks.

<text>Henry Campbell Bruce, 2nd Baron Aberdare, (19 June 1851 ‚Äì 20 February 1929), styled The Honourable from 1873 to 1895, was a British soldier and peer.

==Background==
Born in Merthyr Tydfil, Bruce was the eldest son of Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare, who had served as Home Secretary. His mother Annabella was his father&#x27;s first wife and the daughter of Richard Beadon. He was educated at Rugby School and at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. In 1895, he succeeded his father as baron.

==Career==
His military career, by virtue of his status in the nobility, was started early: he served in the Welch Regiment and became a major of the 3rd Battalion in 1899. A year later he was appointed its honorary lieutenant-colonel and in 1910 honorary colonel of the 5th Battalion. Later Bruce was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 3rd Battalion. He was decorated with the Volunteer Decoration.

Bruce was president of University College as well as of the National Museum Wales. He was a Justice of the Peace, assigned to Glamorgan and represented the county first as Deputy Lieutenant from December 1901, later as Vice Lord Lieutenant.

He was a member of the London Survey Committee, a voluntary organisation publishing architectural surveys of the capital.

==Family==
Bruce married Constance Mary, daughter of Hamilton Beckett on 10 February 1880. The couple had nine children together, five sons and four daughters.
* Capt. Hon. Henry Lyndhurst Bruce (25 May 1881 ‚Äì 14 December 1914), married in 1906 Camille Clifford, a Belgian-born stage actress and the most famous model for the &quot;Gibson Girl&quot; illustrations; killed in action in Ypres with the Royal Scots in First World War

<text>Google LLC (, ) is an American multinational corporation and technology company focusing on online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, consumer electronics, and artificial intelligence (AI). It has been referred to as &quot;the most powerful company in the world&quot; by the BBC and is one of the world&#x27;s most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the field of AI. Alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, Google&#x27;s parent company, Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big Tech companies.

Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together, they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet&#x27;s largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet&#x27;s internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.

The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation and mapping (Waze, Maps and Earth), cloud computing (Cloud), web navigation (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), videotelephony (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch and Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), AI (Google Assistant and Gemini), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail. Google&#x27;s other ventures outside of internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google DeepMind).

Google Search and YouTube are the two most-visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter (now known as X). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, online video platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, machine learning framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by &quot;Forbes&quot; as of January 2022 and fourth by Interbrand as of February 2022.

The company has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position. On August 5, 2024, D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit P. Mehta ruled that Google held an illegal monopoly over Internet search.
== History ==


=== Early years ===

Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California. The project initially involved an unofficial &quot;third founder&quot;, Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships among websites. They called this algorithm PageRank; it determined a website&#x27;s relevance by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the original site. Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing the code to implement Page&#x27;s ideas. Page and Brin would also use their friend Susan Wojcicki&#x27;s garage as their office when the search engine was set up in 1998.

Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine &quot;BackRub&quot; because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site. Hassan, as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998. H√©ctor Garc√≠a-Molina and Jeffrey Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project. PageRank was influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page&#x27;s PageRank patent including a citation to Li&#x27;s earlier RankDex patent; Li later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.

Eventually, they changed the name to &quot;Google&quot;; the name of the search engine was a misspelling of the word &quot;googol&quot;, a very large number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of information.

Google was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able to use the funds. Page and Brin initially approached David Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim. The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David&#x27;s home in Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a $250,000 investment.

Google received money from two other angel investors in 1998: Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and entrepreneur Ram Shriram. Page and Brin had first approached Shriram, who was a venture capitalist, for funding and counsel, and Shriram invested $250,000 in Google in February 1998. Shriram knew Bezos because Amazon had acquired Junglee, at which Shriram was the president. It was Shriram who told Bezos about Google. Bezos asked Shriram to meet Google&#x27;s founders and they met six months after Shriram had made his investment when Bezos and his wife were on a vacation trip to the Bay Area. Google&#x27;s initial funding round had already formally closed but Bezos&#x27; status as CEO of Amazon was enough to persuade Page and Brin to extend the round and accept his investment.

Between these initial investors, friends, and family Google raised around $1,000,000, which is what allowed them to open up their original shop in Menlo Park, California.
Craig Silverstein, a fellow PhD student at Stanford, was hired as the first employee.

After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999, with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital. Both firms were initially hesitant about investing jointly in Google, as each wanted to retain a larger percentage of control over the company to themselves. Larry and Sergey however insisted on taking investments from both. Both venture companies finally agreed to investing jointly $12.5 million each due to their belief in Google&#x27;s great potential and through the mediation of earlier angel investors Ron Conway and Ram Shriram who had contacts in the venture companies.

=== Growth ===
In March 1999, the company moved its offices to Palo Alto, California, which is home to several prominent Silicon Valley technology start-ups. The next year, Google began selling advertisements associated with search keywords against Page and Brin&#x27;s initial opposition toward an advertising-funded search engine. To maintain an uncluttered page design, advertisements were solely text-based. In June 2000, it was announced that Google would become the default search engine provider for Yahoo!, one of the most popular websites at the time, replacing Inktomi.

In 2003, after outgrowing two other locations, the company leased an office complex from Silicon Graphics, at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway in Mountain View, California. The complex became known as the Googleplex, a play on the word googolplex, the number one followed by a googol of zeroes. Three years later, Google bought the property from SGI for $319¬†million. By that time, the name &quot;Google&quot; had found its way into everyday language, causing the verb &quot;google&quot; to be added to the &quot;Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, denoted as: &quot;to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet&quot;. The first use of the verb on television appeared in an October 2002 episode of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;.

Additionally, in 2001 Google&#x27;s investors felt the need to have a strong internal management, and they agreed to hire Eric Schmidt as the chairman and CEO of Google. Eric was proposed by John Doerr from Kleiner Perkins. He had been trying to find a CEO that Sergey and Larry would accept for several months, but they rejected several candidates because they wanted to retain control over the company. Michael Moritz from Sequoia Capital at one point even menaced requesting Google to immediately pay back Sequoia&#x27;s $12.5m investment if they did not fulfill their promise to hire a chief executive officer, which had been made verbally during investment negotiations. Eric was not initially enthusiastic about joining Google either, as the company&#x27;s full potential had not yet been widely recognized at the time, and as he was occupied with his responsibilities at Novell where he was CEO. As part of him joining, Eric agreed to buy $1 million of Google preferred stocks as a way to show his commitment and to provide funds Google needed.

=== Initial public offering ===
On August 19, 2004, Google became a public company via an initial public offering, listing the company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GOOG. At that time Page, Brin and Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for 20 years, until the year 2024. The company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. Shares were sold in an online auction format using a system built by Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, underwriters for the deal. The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.
On October 9, 2006, Google acquired YouTube for $1.65 billion in Google stock, On July 20, 2007, Google bids $4.6 billion for the wireless-spectrum auction by the FCC. On March 11, 2008, Google acquired DoubleClick for $3.1¬†billion, transferring to Google valuable relationships that DoubleClick had with Web publishers and advertising agencies. By 2011, Google was handling approximately 3 billion searches per day. To handle this workload, Google built 11 data centers around the world with several thousand servers in each. These data centers allowed Google to handle the ever-changing workload more efficiently.

In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed one billion for the first time. In May 2012, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5¬†billion, in its largest acquisition to date. This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola&#x27;s considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies, to help protect Google in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies, mainly Apple and Microsoft, and to allow it to continue to freely offer Android.

=== 2012 onwards ===
In June 2013, Google acquired Waze for $966 million. While Waze would remain an independent entity, its social features, such as its crowdsourced location platform, were reportedly valuable integrations between Waze and Google Maps, Google&#x27;s own mapping service. Google announced the launch of a new company, called Calico, on September 19, 2013, to be led by Apple Inc. chairman Arthur Levinson. In the official public statement, Page explained that the &quot;health and well-being&quot; company would focus on &quot;the challenge of ageing and associated diseases&quot;.
On January 26, 2014, Google announced it had agreed to acquire DeepMind Technologies, a privately held artificial intelligence company from London. Technology news website &quot;Recode&quot; reported that the company was purchased for $400 million, yet the source of the information was not disclosed. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on the price. The purchase of DeepMind aids in Google&#x27;s recent growth in the artificial intelligence and robotics community. In 2015, DeepMind&#x27;s AlphaGo became the first computer program to defeat a top human pro at the game of Go.

According to Interbrand&#x27;s annual Best Global Brands report, Google has been the second most valuable brand in the world (behind Apple Inc.) in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, with a valuation of $133 billion.

On August 10, 2015, Google announced plans to reorganize its various interests as a conglomerate named Alphabet Inc. Google became Alphabet&#x27;s largest subsidiary and the umbrella company for Alphabet&#x27;s Internet interests. Upon completion of the restructuring, Sundar Pichai became CEO of Google, replacing Larry Page, who became CEO of Alphabet.

On August 8, 2017, Google fired employee James Damore after he distributed a memo throughout the company that argued bias and &quot;Google&#x27;s Ideological Echo Chamber&quot; clouded their thinking about diversity and inclusion, and that it is also biological factors, not discrimination alone, that cause the average woman to be less interested than men in technical positions. Google CEO Sundar Pichai accused Damore of violating company policy by &quot;advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace&quot;, and he was fired on the same day.

Between 2018 and 2019, tensions between the company&#x27;s leadership and its workers escalated as staff protested company decisions on internal sexual harassment, Dragonfly, a censored Chinese search engine, and Project Maven, a military drone artificial intelligence, which had been seen as areas of revenue growth for the company. On October 25, 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published the &quot;expos√©&quot;, &quot;How Google Protected Andy Rubin, the &#x27;Father of Android&#x27;&quot;. The company subsequently announced that &quot;48 employees have been fired over the last two years&quot; for sexual misconduct. On November 1, 2018, more than 20,000 Google employees and contractors staged a global walk-out to protest the company&#x27;s handling of sexual harassment complaints. CEO Sundar Pichai was reported to be in support of the protests. Later in 2019, some workers accused the company of retaliating against internal activists.

On March 19, 2019, Google announced that it would enter the video game market, launching a cloud gaming platform called Google Stadia.

On June 3, 2019, the United States Department of Justice reported that it would investigate Google for antitrust violations. This led to the filing of an antitrust lawsuit in October 2020, on the grounds the company had abused a monopoly position in the search and search advertising markets.

In December 2019, former PayPal chief operating officer Bill Ready became Google&#x27;s new commerce chief. Ready&#x27;s role will not be directly involved with Google Pay.

In April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Google announced several cost-cutting measures. Such measures included slowing down hiring for the remainder of 2020, except for a small number of strategic areas, recalibrating the focus and pace of investments in areas like data centers and machines, and non-business essential marketing and travel. Most employees were also working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the success of it even led to Google announcing that they would be permanently converting some of their jobs to work from home 

The 2020 Google services outages disrupted Google services: one in August that affected Google Drive among others, another in November affecting YouTube, and a third in December affecting the entire suite of Google applications. All three outages were resolved within hours.

In 2021, the Alphabet Workers Union was founded, composed mostly of Google employees.

In January 2021, the Australian Government proposed legislation that would require Google and Facebook to pay media companies for the right to use their content. In response, Google threatened to close off access to its search engine in Australia.

In March 2021, Google reportedly paid $20 million for Ubisoft ports on Google Stadia. Google spent &quot;tens of millions of dollars&quot; on getting major publishers such as Ubisoft and Take-Two to bring some of their biggest games to Stadia.

In April 2021, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Google ran a years-long program called &quot;Project Bernanke&quot; that used data from past advertising bids to gain an advantage over competing for ad services. This was revealed in documents concerning the antitrust lawsuit filed by ten US states against Google in December.

In September 2021, the Australian government announced plans to curb Google&#x27;s capability to sell targeted ads, claiming that the company has a monopoly on the market harming publishers, advertisers, and consumers.

In 2022, Google began accepting requests for the removal of phone numbers, physical addresses and email addresses from its search results. It had previously accepted requests for removing confidential data only, such as Social Security numbers, bank account and credit card numbers, personal signatures, and medical records. Even with the new policy, Google may remove information from only certain but not all search queries. It would not remove content that is &quot;broadly useful&quot;, such as news articles, or already part of the public record.

In May 2022, Google announced that the company had acquired California based, MicroLED display technology development and manufacturing Start-up Raxium. Raxium is set to join Google&#x27;s Devices and Services team to aid in the development of micro-optics, monolithic integration, and system integration.

In December 2022, Google debuted OSV-Scanner, a Go tool for finding security holes in open source software, which pulls from the largest open source vulnerability database of its kind to defend against supply chain attacks.

Following the success of ChatGPT and concerns that Google was falling behind in the AI race, Google&#x27;s senior management issued a &quot;code red&quot; and a &quot;directive that all of its most important products‚Äîthose with more than a billion users‚Äîmust incorporate generative AI within months&quot;. In March 2023, in direct response to the rapid rise of ChatGPT, Google released Bard (now Gemini), a generative artificial intelligence chatbot.

In early May 2023, Google announced its plans to build two additional data centers in Ohio. These centers, which will be built in Columbus and Lancaster, will power up the company&#x27;s tools, including AI technology. The said data hub will add to the already operational center near Columbus, bringing Google&#x27;s total investment in Ohio to over $2 billion.

In August 2024, Google would lose a lawsuit which started in 2020 in lower court, as it was found that the company had an illegal monopoly over Internet search. D.C. Circuit Court Judge Amit Mehta held that this monopoly was in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. In September 2024, the EU Court of Justice, based in Europe, would also find that Google held an illegal monopoly, in this case with regards to its shopping search, and could not avoid paying a ‚Ç¨2.4 billion fine. The EU Court of Justice found that Google&#x27;s treatment of rival shopping searches, which the court referred to as &quot;discriminatory&quot;, was in violation of the Digital Markets Act.

In October 2024, Google was fined by Russia with 2.5 decillion dollars for allegedly blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda.

In November 2024, Google announced the establishment of a new artificial intelligence (AI) hub in Saudi Arabia, aiming to support the Kingdom&#x27;s economic growth and technological development as part of its Vision 2030 initiative. This AI hub is projected to contribute up to $71 billion to Saudi Arabia&#x27;s economy by advancing AI-driven solutions tailored to the region&#x27;s specific needs and training local talent.

The partnership between Google and Saudi Arabia includes collaboration with key stakeholders, such as the Public Investment Fund (PIF), to develop AI applications that will benefit sectors like healthcare, finance, oil and gas, and logistics. The initiative focuses on creating localized AI technologies, with an emphasis on integrating Arabic language capabilities and enabling widespread cloud adoption.

== Products and services ==
=== Search engine ===

Google indexes billions of web pages to allow users to search for the information they desire through the use of keywords and operators. According to comScore market research from November 2009, Google Search is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a market share of 65.6%. In May 2017, Google enabled a new &quot;Personal&quot; tab in Google Search, letting users search for content in their Google accounts&#x27; various services, including email messages from Gmail and photos from Google Photos.

Google launched its Google News service in 2002, an automated service which summarizes news articles from various websites. Google also hosts Google Books, a service which searches the text found in books in its database and shows limited previews or and the full book where allowed.

Google expanded its search services to include shopping (launched originally as Froogle in 2002), finance (launched 2006), and flights (launched 2011).

=== Advertising ===
Google generates most of its revenues from advertising. This includes sales of apps, purchases made in-app, digital content products on Google and YouTube, Android and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud offerings. Forty-six percent of this profit was from clicks (cost per clicks), amounting to US$109,652 million in 2017. This includes three principal methods, namely AdMob, AdSense (such as AdSense for Content, AdSense for Search, etc.) and DoubleClick AdExchange. In addition to its own algorithms for understanding search requests, Google uses technology from its acquisition of DoubleClick, to project user interest and target advertising to the search context and the user history. In 2007, Google launched &quot;AdSense for Mobile&quot;, taking advantage of the emerging mobile advertising market.

Google Analytics allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page. Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google Ads allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through a cost-per-click scheme. The sister service, Google AdSense, allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website and earn money every time ads are clicked. One of the criticisms of this program is the possibility of click fraud, which occurs when a person or automated script clicks on advertisements without being interested in the product, causing the advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claimed that approximately 14 to 20¬†percent of clicks were fraudulent or invalid. Google Search Console (rebranded from Google Webmaster Tools in May 2015) allows webmasters to check the sitemap, crawl rate, and for security issues of their websites, as well as optimize their website&#x27;s visibility.

=== Artificial intelligence ===
Google had previously used virtual assistants and chatbots, such as Google Bard, prior to the announcement of Gemini in March 2024. None of them, however, had been seen as legitimate competitors to ChatGPT, unlike Gemini. An artificial intelligence training program for Google employees was also introduced in April 2024.

Google has also created the text-to-image model Imagen, and the text-to-video model Veo.

In 2023, Google released NotebookLM, an online tool for synthesizing documents using Gemini. In September 2024, it gained attention for its &quot;Audio Overview&quot; feature, which generates podcast-like summaries of documents. Google also developed LearnLM, a family of language models serving as personal AI tutors.

==== Hardware ====

In January 2010, Google released Nexus One, the first Android phone under its own brand. It spawned a number of phones and tablets under the &quot;Nexus&quot; branding until its eventual discontinuation in 2016, replaced by a new brand called Pixel.

In 2011, the Chromebook was introduced, which runs on ChromeOS.

In July 2013, Google introduced the Chromecast dongle, which allows users to stream content from their smartphones to televisions.

In June 2014, Google announced Google Cardboard, a simple cardboard viewer that lets the user place their smartphone in a special front compartment to view virtual reality (VR) media.

In October 2016, Google announced Daydream View, a lightweight VR viewer which lets the user place their smartphone in the front hinge to view VR media.

Other hardware products include:
* Nest, a series of voice assistant smart speakers that can answer voice queries, play music, find information from apps (calendar, weather etc.), and control third-party smart home appliances (users can tell it to turn on the lights, for example). The Google Nest line includes the original Google Home (later succeeded by the Nest Audio), the Google Home Mini (later succeeded by the Nest Mini), the Google Home Max, the Google Home Hub (later rebranded as the Nest Hub), and the Nest Hub Max.
* Nest Wifi (originally Google Wifi), a connected set of Wi-Fi routers to simplify and extend coverage of home Wi-Fi.

=== Enterprise services ===

On September 24, 2012, Google launched Google for Entrepreneurs, a largely not-for-profit business incubator providing startups with co-working spaces known as Campuses, with assistance to startup founders that may include workshops, conferences, and mentorships. Presently, there are seven Campus locations: Berlin, London, Madrid, Seoul, S√£o Paulo, Tel Aviv, and Warsaw.

On March 15, 2016, Google announced the introduction of Google Analytics 360 Suite, &quot;a set of integrated data and marketing analytics products, designed specifically for the needs of enterprise-class marketers&quot; which can be integrated with BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform. Among other things, the suite is designed to help &quot;enterprise class marketers&quot; &quot;see the complete customer journey&quot;, generate &quot;useful insights&quot;, and &quot;deliver engaging experiences to the right people&quot;. Jack Marshall of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the suite competes with existing marketing cloud offerings by companies including Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM.

=== Internet services ===
In February 2010, Google announced the Google Fiber project, with experimental plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities. Following Google&#x27;s corporate restructure to make Alphabet Inc. its parent company, Google Fiber was moved to Alphabet&#x27;s Access division.

In April 2015, Google announced Project Fi, a mobile virtual network operator, that combines Wi-Fi and cellular networks from different telecommunication providers in an effort to enable seamless connectivity and fast Internet signal.

=== Financial services ===
In August 2023, Google became the first major tech company to join the OpenWallet Foundation, launched earlier in the year, whose goal was creating open-source software for interoperable digital wallets.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Stock price performance and quarterly earnings ===
Google&#x27;s initial public offering (IPO) took place on August 19, 2004. At IPO, the company offered 19,605,052 shares at a price of $85 per share. The sale of $1.67 billion gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion. The stock performed well after the IPO, with shares hitting $350 for the first time on October 31, 2007, primarily because of strong sales and earnings in the online advertising market. The surge in stock price was fueled mainly by individual investors, as opposed to large institutional investors and mutual funds. GOOG shares split into GOOG class C shares and GOOGL class A shares. The company is listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the ticker symbols GOOGL and GOOG, and on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GGQ1. These ticker symbols now refer to Alphabet Inc., Google&#x27;s holding company, 

In the third quarter of 2005, Google reported a 700% increase in profit, largely due to large companies shifting their advertising strategies from newspapers, magazines, and television to the Internet.

For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492 billion in total advertising revenues and only $112 million in licensing and other revenues. In 2011, 96% of Google&#x27;s revenue was derived from its advertising programs.

Google generated $50 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2012, generating $38 billion the previous year. In January 2013, then-CEO Larry Page commented, &quot;We ended 2012 with a strong quarter ... Revenues were up 36% year-on-year, and 8% quarter-on-quarter. And we hit $50 billion in revenues for the first time last year ‚Äì not a bad achievement in just a decade and a half.&quot;

Google&#x27;s consolidated revenue for the third quarter of 2013 was reported in mid-October 2013 as $14.89 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to the previous quarter. Google&#x27;s Internet business was responsible for $10.8 billion of this total, with an increase in the number of users&#x27; clicks on advertisements. By January 2014, Google&#x27;s market capitalization had grown to $397 billion.

=== Tax avoidance strategies ===

Google uses various tax avoidance strategies. On the list of largest technology companies by revenue, it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues. Google between 2007 and 2010 saved $3.1 billion in taxes by shuttling non-U.S. profits through Ireland and the Netherlands and then to Bermuda. Such techniques lower its non-U.S. tax rate to 2.3 per cent, while normally the corporate tax rate in, for instance, the UK is 28 per cent. This reportedly sparked a French investigation into Google&#x27;s transfer pricing practices in 2012.

In 2020, Google said it had overhauled its controversial global tax structure and consolidated all of its intellectual property holdings back to the U.S.

Google Vice-president Matt Brittin testified to the Public Accounts Committee of the UK House of Commons that his UK sales team made no sales and hence owed no sales taxes to the UK. In January 2016, Google reached a settlement with the UK to pay ¬£130m in back taxes plus higher taxes in future. In 2017, Google channeled $22.7 billion from the Netherlands to Bermuda to reduce its tax bill.

In 2013, Google ranked 5th in lobbying spending, up from 213th in 2003. In 2012, the company ranked 2nd in campaign donations of technology and Internet sections.

=== Corporate identity ===
The name &quot;Google&quot; originated from a misspelling of &quot;googol&quot;, which refers to the number represented by a 1 followed by one-hundred zeros. Page and Brin write in their original paper on PageRank: &quot;We chose our system name, Google, because it is a common spelling of googol, or 10100[,] and fits well with our goal of building very large-scale search engines.&quot; Having found its way increasingly into everyday language, the verb &quot;google&quot; was added to the &quot;Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2006, meaning &quot;to use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet.&quot; Google&#x27;s mission statement, from the outset, was &quot;to organize the world&#x27;s information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;, and its unofficial slogan is &quot;Don&#x27;t be evil&quot;. In October 2015, a related motto was adopted in the Alphabet corporate code of conduct by the phrase: &quot;Do the right thing&quot;. The original motto was retained in the code of conduct of Google, now a subsidiary of Alphabet.

The original Google logo was designed by Sergey Brin. Google has been designing special, temporary alternate logos to place on their homepage intended to celebrate holidays, events, achievements and people. The first Google Doodle was in honor of the Burning Man Festival of 1998. The doodle was designed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin to notify users of their absence in case the servers crashed. Subsequent Google Doodles were designed by an outside contractor, until Larry and Sergey asked then-intern Dennis Hwang to design a logo for Bastille Day in 2000. From that point onward, Doodles have been organized and created by a team of employees termed &quot;Doodlers&quot;.

Google has a tradition of creating April Fools&#x27; Day jokes. Its first on April 1, 2000, was Google MentalPlex which allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web. In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called TiSP, or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a fiber-optic cable down their toilet.

Google&#x27;s services contain easter eggs, such as the Swedish Chef&#x27;s &quot;Bork bork bork&quot;, Pig Latin, &quot;Hacker&quot; or leetspeak, Elmer Fudd, Pirate, and Klingon as language selections for its search engine. When searching for the word &quot;anagram&quot;, meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google&#x27;s suggestion feature displays &quot;Did you mean: nag a ram?&quot; Since 2019, Google runs free online courses to help engineers learn how to plan and author technical documentation better.

=== Workplace culture ===

On &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the best companies to work for, Google ranked first in 2007, 2008 and 2012, and fourth in 2009 and 2010. Google was also nominated in 2010 to be the world&#x27;s most attractive employer to graduating students in the Universum Communications talent attraction index. Google&#x27;s corporate philosophy includes principles such as &quot;you can make money without doing evil&quot;, &quot;you can be serious without a suit&quot;, and &quot;work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun&quot;.

 Alphabet Inc. had 132,121 employees, of which more than 100,000 worked for Google. Google&#x27;s diversity report states that 32 percent of its workforce are women and 68 percent are men, with the ethnicity of its workforce being predominantly white (51.7%) and Asian (41.9%). Within tech roles, 23.6 percent were women; and 26.7 percent of leadership roles were held by women. In addition to its 100,000+ full-time employees, Google used about 121,000 temporary workers and contractors, 

Google&#x27;s employees are hired based on a hierarchical system. Employees are split into six hierarchies based on experience and can range &quot;from entry-level data center workers at level one to managers and experienced engineers at level six&quot;. As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy known as Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them. Some of Google&#x27;s services, such as Gmail, Google News, Orkut, and AdSense, originated from these independent endeavors. In a talk at Stanford University, Marissa Mayer, Google&#x27;s vice-president of Search Products and User Experience until July 2012, showed that half of all new product launches in the second half of 2005 had originated from the Innovation Time Off.

In 2005, articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and other sources began suggesting that Google had lost its anti-corporate, no evil philosophy. In an effort to maintain the company&#x27;s unique culture, Google designated a Chief Culture Officer whose purpose was to develop and maintain the culture and work on ways to keep true to the core values that the company was founded on. Google has also faced allegations of sexism and ageism from former employees. In 2013, a class action against several Silicon Valley companies, including Google, was filed for alleged &quot;no cold call&quot; agreements which restrained the recruitment of high-tech employees. In a lawsuit filed January 8, 2018, multiple employees and job applicants alleged Google discriminated against a class defined by their &quot;conservative political views[,] male gender[,] and/or [...] Caucasian or Asian race&quot;.

On January 25, 2020, the formation of an international workers union of Google employees, Alpha Global, was announced. The coalition is made up of &quot;13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, [the] United Kingdom, and Switzerland&quot;. The group is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, which represents nearly 20 million international workers from various unions and federations. The formation of the union is in response to persistent allegations of mistreatment of Google employees and a toxic workplace culture. Google had previously been accused of surveilling and firing employees who were suspected of organizing a workers union. In 2021, court documents revealed that between 2018 and 2020, Google ran an anti-union campaign called Project Vivian to &quot;convince them (employees) that unions suck&quot;.

In February 2025, Google dropped their commitment to make &quot;diversity, equity, and inclusion part of everything we do&quot; from their annual investor report. This action followed Meta, Amazon, Pepsi, McDonald&#x27;s, Walmart and others who all have rolled back their DEI programmes.

=== Office locations ===


Google&#x27;s headquarters in Mountain View, California is referred to as &quot;the Googleplex&quot;, a play on words on the number googolplex and the headquarters itself being a &quot;complex&quot; of buildings. Internationally, Google has over 78 offices in more than 50 countries.

In 2006, Google moved into about of office space at 111 Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. The office houses its largest advertising sales team. In 2010, Google bought the building housing the headquarter, in a deal that valued the property at around $1.9 billion. In March 2018, Google&#x27;s parent company Alphabet bought the nearby Chelsea Market building for $2.4 billion. The sale is touted as one of the most expensive real estate transactions for a single building in the history of New York. In November 2018, Google announced its plan to expand its New York City office to a capacity of 12,000 employees. The same December, it was announced that a $1 billion, headquarters for Google would be built in Manhattan&#x27;s Hudson Square neighborhood. Called Google Hudson Square, the new campus is projected to more than double the number of Google employees working in New York City.

By late 2006, Google established a new headquarters for its AdWords division in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In November 2006, Google opened offices on Carnegie Mellon&#x27;s campus in Pittsburgh, focusing on shopping-related advertisement coding and smartphone applications and programs. Other office locations in the U.S. include Atlanta; Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Cambridge, Massachusetts; San Francisco; Seattle and Kirkland, Washington; Birmingham, Michigan; Reston, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wisconsin.

It also has product research and development operations in cities around the world, namely Sydney (birthplace location of Google Maps) and London (part of Android development). In November 2013, Google announced plans for a new London headquarter, a 1 million square foot office able to accommodate 4,500 employees. Recognized as one of the biggest ever commercial property acquisitions at the time of the deal&#x27;s announcement in January, Google submitted plans for the new headquarter to the Camden Council in June 2017. In May 2015, Google announced its intention to create its own campus in Hyderabad, India. The new campus, reported to be the company&#x27;s largest outside the United States, will accommodate 13,000 employees.

Google&#x27;s Global Offices sum a total of 86 locations worldwide, with 32 offices in North America, three of them in Canada and 29 in United States Territory, California being the state with the most Google&#x27;s offices with 9 in total including the Googleplex. In the Latin America Region Google counts with 6 offices, in Europe 24 (3 of them in UK). The Asia Pacific region counts with 26 offices principally five in India and three in Australia, three in China, and the Africa Middle East region counts five offices.

=== Infrastructure ===
Google has data centers in North and South America, Asia, and Europe. There is no official data on the number of servers in Google data centers; however, research and advisory firm Gartner estimated in a July 2016 report that Google at the time had 2.5 million servers. Traditionally, Google relied on parallel computing on commodity hardware like mainstream x86 computers (similar to home PCs) to keep costs per query low. In 2005, it started developing its own designs, which were only revealed in 2009.

Google has built its own private submarine communications cables. The first cable, named Curie, connects California with Chile and was completed on November 15, 2019. The second fully Google-owned undersea cable, named Dunant, connects the United States with France and is planned to begin operation in 2020. Google&#x27;s third subsea cable, Equiano, will connect Lisbon, Portugal with Lagos, Nigeria and Cape Town, South Africa. The company&#x27;s fourth cable, named Grace Hopper, connects landing points in New York, US, Bude, UK and Bilbao, Spain, and is expected to become operational in 2022.

=== Environment ===
In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of solar panels to provide up to 1.6 Megawatt of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus&#x27; energy needs. The system is the largest rooftop photovoltaic power station constructed on a U.S. corporate campus and one of the largest on any corporate site in the world. Google has aimed for carbon neutrality in regard to its operations.

In Spring 2009, Google hired a herd of 200 goats for a week from California Grazing to mow their lawn. It was apparently more eco-friendly.

Google disclosed in September 2011 that it &quot;continuously uses enough electricity to power 200,000 homes&quot;, almost 260 million watts or about a quarter of the output of a nuclear power plant. Total carbon emissions for 2010 were just under 1.5 million metric tons, mostly due to fossil fuels that provide electricity for the data centers. Google said that 25 percent of its energy was supplied by renewable fuels in 2010. An average search uses only 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, so all global searches are only 12.5 million watts or 5% of the total electricity consumption by Google.

In 2010, Google Energy made its first investment in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8¬†million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5¬†megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates. The corporation exercised this authorization in September 2013 when it announced it would purchase all the electricity produced by the not-yet-built 240-megawatt Happy Hereford wind farm.

In July 2010, Google signed an agreement with an Iowa wind farm to buy 114 megawatts of power for 20 years.

In December 2016, Google announced that‚Äîstarting in 2017‚Äîit would purchase enough renewable energy to match 100% of the energy usage of its data centers and offices. The commitment will make Google &quot;the world&#x27;s largest corporate buyer of renewable power, with commitments reaching 2.6 gigawatts (2,600 megawatts) of wind and solar energy&quot;.

In November 2017, Google bought 536 megawatts of wind power. The purchase made the firm reach 100% renewable energy. The wind energy comes from two power plants in South Dakota, one in Iowa and one in Oklahoma. In September 2019, Google&#x27;s chief executive announced plans for a $2 billion wind and solar investment, the biggest renewable energy deal in corporate history. This will grow their green energy profile by 40%, giving them an extra 1.6 gigawatt of clean energy, the company said.

In September 2020, Google announced it had retroactively offset all of its carbon emissions since the company&#x27;s foundation in 1998. It also stated that it is committed to operating its data centers and offices using only carbon-free energy by 2030. In October 2020, the company pledged to make the packaging for its hardware products 100% plastic-free and 100% recyclable by 2025. It also said that all its final assembly manufacturing sites will achieve a UL 2799 Zero Waste to Landfill certification by 2022 by ensuring that the vast majority of waste from the manufacturing process is recycled instead of ending up in a landfill.

In 2023 Google consumed 24 TWh of electricity, more than countries such as Iceland, Ghana, the Dominican Republic, or Tunisia.

==== Climate change denial and misinformation ====
Google donates to climate change denial political groups including the State Policy Network and the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The company also actively funds and profits from climate disinformation by monetizing ad spaces on most of the largest climate disinformation sites. Google continued to monetize and profit from sites propagating climate disinformation even after the company updated their policy to prohibit placing their ads on similar sites.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic Google.org, with a start-up fund of $1¬†billion. The mission of the organization is to create awareness about climate change, global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired Larry Brilliant as the program&#x27;s executive director in 2004 and Megan Smith has replaced him as director.

In March 2007, in partnership with the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI), Google hosted the first Julia Robinson Mathematics Festival at its headquarters in Mountain View. In 2011, Google donated 1¬†million euros to International Mathematical Olympiad to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011‚Äì2015). In July 2012, Google launched a &quot;Legalize Love&quot; campaign in support of gay rights.

In 2008, Google announced its &quot;project 10100&quot;, which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites. After two years of no update, during which many wondered what had happened to the program, Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.

Responding to the humanitarian crisis after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Google announced a $15 million donation to support Ukrainian citizens. The company also decided to transform its office in Warsaw into a help center for refugees.

Also in February 2022, Google announced a $100 million fund to expand skills training and job placement for low-income Americans, in conjunction with non-profits Year Up, Social Finance, and Merit America.

== Criticism and controversies ==


Google has had criticism over issues such as aggressive tax avoidance, search neutrality, copyright, censorship of search results and content, and privacy.

Other criticisms are alleged misuse and manipulation of search results, its use of other people&#x27;s intellectual property, concerns that its compilation of data may violate people&#x27;s privacy, and the energy consumption of its servers, as well as concerns over traditional business issues such as monopoly, restraint of trade, anti-competitive practices, and patent infringement.

=== 2018 ===
In July 2018, Mozilla program manager Chris Peterson accused Google of intentionally slowing down YouTube performance on Firefox.

According to Ryan Gallagher of The Intercept in August 2018, Google was developing for the People&#x27;s Republic of China a censored version of its search engine (known as Dragonfly) &quot;that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest&quot;. Google was grilled at a Senate committee hearing on the project one month later. The project was canceled in December following the backlash it garnered both externally and internally within the company.

=== 2019 ===
In 2019, a hub for critics of Google dedicated to abstaining from using Google products coalesced in the Reddit online community /r/degoogle. The DeGoogle grassroots campaign continues to grow as privacy activists highlight information about Google products, and the associated incursion on personal privacy rights by the company.

In April 2019, former Mozilla executive Jonathan Nightingale accused Google of intentionally and systematically sabotaging the Firefox browser over the past decade in order to boost adoption of Google Chrome.

In November 2019, the Office for Civil Rights of the United States Department of Health and Human Services began investigation into Project Nightingale, to assess whether the &quot;mass collection of individuals&#x27; medical records&quot; complied with HIPAA. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Google secretively began the project in 2018, with St. Louis-based healthcare company Ascension.

=== 2022 ===
In a 2022 National Labor Relations Board ruling, court documents suggested that Google sponsored a secretive project‚Äî&quot;Project Vivian&quot;‚Äîto counsel its employees and to discourage them from forming unions.

Google reportedly paid Apple $22 billion in 2022 to maintain its position as the default search engine on Safari. This deal underscores the intense competition in the tech industry for dominance in the search market. It marks one of the largest payments between two tech giants in recent years.

=== 2023 ===
On May 1, 2023, Google placed an ad against anti-disinformation Brazilian Congressional Bill No. 2630, which was about to be approved, on its search homepage in Brazil, calling on its users to ask congressional representatives to oppose the legislation. The country&#x27;s government and judiciary accused the company of undue interference in the congressional debate, saying it could amount to abuse of economic power and ordering the company to change the ad within two hours of notification or face fines of per non-compliance hour. The company then promptly removed the ad.

=== 2024 ===
In March 2024, a former Google software engineer and Chinese national, Linwei Ding, was accused of stealing confidential artificial intelligence information from the company and handing it to Chinese corporations. Ding had allegedly stolen over 500 files from the company over the course of 5 years, having been hired in 2019. Upon discovering Ding had been in contact with Chinese state-owned companies, Google notified the FBI, who carried on the investigation.

In May 2024, a misconfiguration in Google Cloud led to the accidental deletion of UniSuper&#x27;s $135 billion Australian pension fund account, affecting over half a million members who were unable to access their accounts for a week. The outage, attributed to a cloud service error and not a cyberattack, prompted a joint apology from UniSuper and Google Cloud executives, who assured members that no personal data was compromised and restoration efforts were underway.

In August 2024, Google sent an email to users informing them of its legal obligation to disclose certain confidential information to U.S. government authorities. The company stated that when it receives valid requests from government agencies to produce documents without redacting confidential customer information, it may produce such documents even if they are confidential to users. However, it will request confidential treatment of such information from the government.

In September 2024, Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found that Google engaged in anti-competitive practices in the online advertising technology market, potentially harming thousands of UK publishers and advertisers. The investigation claimed Google used its market power to prevent rivals from competing fairly, affecting billions spent on digital ads. Google rejected the findings as flawed, stating its ad tech benefits businesses. If found guilty, Google could face penalties of up to 10% of its global turnover. Similar investigations are ongoing in the U.S. and EU, where regulators have suggested that Google may need to sell part of its ad-tech business.

=== Palestine ===

Google is also part of Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion deal in which the technology companies Google and Amazon will provide Israel and its military with artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other cloud computing services, including building local cloud sites that will &quot;keep information within Israel&#x27;s borders under strict security guidelines.&quot; The contract has been criticized by shareholders and employees over concerns that the project could lead to human rights abuses against Palestinians, in the context of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and the disputed status of Palestinian territories. Ariel Koren, a former marketing manager for Google&#x27;s educational products and an outspoken critic of the project, wrote that Google &quot;systematically silences Palestinian, Jewish, Arab and Muslim voices concerned about Google&#x27;s complicity in violations of Palestinian human rights‚Äîto the point of formally retaliating against workers and creating an environment of fear&quot;, and said she was retaliated against for organizing against the project.

In March 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Google Photos was being used in a facial recognition program by Unit 8200, a surveillance unit of the Israeli Defense Forces, to surveil Palestinians in the Gaza Strip amid the Israel-Hamas War. A Google spokesman commented that the service is free and &quot;does not provide identities for unknown people in photographs.&quot;

On April 18, 2024, Google dismissed 28 employees who participated in protests against the company&#x27;s involvement in Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion contract with the Israeli government to provide cloud computing and AI infrastructure, which the employees argued should not be used for military or intelligence services. The protesting employees, part of the group No Tech For Apartheid, staged sit-ins at Google&#x27;s offices in New York and Sunnyvale, California, leading to disruptions and blockages within the company facilities. This had followed reports of Israeli forces killing large numbers of Palestinian civilians while using own Lavender AI system to identify targets.

=== Antitrust, privacy, and other litigation ===

====Fines and lawsuits====

===== European Union =====
On June 27, 2017, the company received a record fine of from the European Union for &quot;promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results.&quot;

On July 18, 2018, the European Commission fined Google ‚Ç¨4.34 billion for breaching EU antitrust rules. The abuse of dominants position has been referred to as Google&#x27;s constraint applied to Android device manufacturers and network operators to ensure that traffic on Android devices goes to the Google search engine. On October 9, 2018, Google confirmed that it had appealed the fine to the General Court of the European Union.

On October 8, 2018, a class action lawsuit was filed against Google and Alphabet due to &quot;non-public&quot; Google+ account data being exposed as a result of a bug that allowed app developers to gain access to the private information of users. The litigation was settled in July 2020 for $7.5 million with a payout to claimants of at least $5 each, with a maximum of $12 each.

On March 20, 2019, the European Commission imposed a ‚Ç¨1.49 billion ($1.69 billion) fine on Google for preventing rivals from being able to &quot;compete and innovate fairly&quot; in the online advertising market. European Union competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Google had violated EU antitrust rules by &quot;imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites&quot; that required them to exclude search results from Google&#x27;s rivals.

On September 14, 2022, Google lost the appeal of a ‚Ç¨4.125 billion (¬£3.5 billion) fine, which was ruled to be paid after it was proved by the European Commission that Google forced Android phone-makers to carry Google&#x27;s search and web browser apps. Since the initial accusations, Google has changed its policy.

On 10 September 2024, Europe&#x27;s top court imposed a ‚Ç¨2.4 billion fine on Google for abusing its dominance in the shopping comparison market, marking the conclusion of a case that began in 2009 with a complaint from British firm Foundem.

On 18 September 2024, Alphabet&#x27;s Google won a ‚Ç¨1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) antitrust fine from the European Union, while Qualcomm&#x27;s efforts to repeal a penalty were unsuccessful. The General Court agreed with many of the European Commission&#x27;s findings but annulled the Google fine, stating that the Commission failed to consider all relevant factors and did not demonstrate harm to innovation or consumers. Google noted that it had already changed its contract practices in 2016. Meanwhile, Qualcomm saw its fine reduced slightly but failed to overturn the ruling regarding its predatory pricing against Icera. Both companies have options to appeal further.

===== France =====
On January 21, 2019, French data regulator CNIL imposed a record ‚Ç¨50 million fine on Google for breaching the European Union&#x27;s General Data Protection Regulation. The judgment claimed Google had failed to sufficiently inform users of its methods for collecting data to personalize advertising. Google issued a statement saying it was &quot;deeply committed&quot; to transparency and was &quot;studying the decision&quot; before determining its response.

On January 6, 2022, France&#x27;s data privacy regulatory body CNIL fined Alphabet&#x27;s Google 150 million euros (US$169 million) for not allowing its Internet users an easy refusal of Cookies along with Facebook.

On March 20, 2024, Google was fined approximately $270 million by French regulators for using content from news outlets in France without proper disclosure to train its AI, Bard, now renamed Gemini, violating a previous commitment to negotiate content use transparently and fairly.

===== United States =====
After U.S. Congressional hearings in July 2020, and a report from the U.S. House of Representatives&#x27; Antitrust Subcommittee released in early October, the United States Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google on October 20, 2020, asserting that it has illegally maintained its monopoly position in web search and search advertising. The lawsuit alleged that Google engaged in anticompetitive behavior by paying Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion to be the default search engine on iPhones. Later that month, both Facebook and Alphabet agreed to &quot;cooperate and assist one another&quot; in the face of investigation into their online advertising practices. Another suit was brought against Google in 2023 for illegally monopolizing the advertising technology market. In August 2024, District of Columbia U.S. District Court Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google held a monopoly in online search and text advertising in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

On October 8, 2024, The U.S. government suggested it could request Google to divest parts of its business, such as the Chrome browser and Android, due to its alleged monopoly in online search. The Justice Department aimed to limit Google&#x27;s growing dominance in areas like AI. Google, which intended to appeal, argued that the proposals were too extreme, while also dealing with other antitrust cases involving its app store and advertising operations.

In November 2024, the Justice Department proposed major changes to curb Google&#x27;s online search monopoly, including forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser, share search data with competitors, and end exclusive agreements that make Google the default search engine on devices like iPhones. The DoJ also sought a ban on Google re-entering the browser market for five years and restrictions on its investments in rival search or AI technologies. Google called these proposals excessive and harmful to consumers, pledging to appeal. A trial on the case was scheduled for April 2025, though the incoming administration and new DoJ leadership could potentially alter the course of the proceedings.

===== Russia =====

On October 31, 2024, the Russian government imposed a &quot;symbolic&quot; fine of $20 decillion on Google for blocking pro-Russian YouTube channels. In 2022, during the invasion of Ukraine, a Russian court had ordered Google to restore the channels, with penalties doubling every week according to TASS. This comes alongside other large fines against social media companies accused of hosting content critical of the Kremlin or supportive of Ukraine.

==== Geolocation ====
Google has been criticized for continuing to collect location data from users who had turned off location-sharing settings. In 2020, the FBI used a geofence warrant to request data from Google about Android devices near the Seattle Police Officers Guild building following an arson attempt during Black Lives Matter protests. Google provided anonymized location data from devices in the area, which raised privacy concerns due to the potential inclusion of unrelated protesters.

=== Private browsing lawsuit ===

In early June 2020, a $5 billion class-action lawsuit was filed against Google by a group of consumers, alleging that Chrome&#x27;s Incognito browsing mode still collects their user history. The lawsuit became known in March 2021 when a federal judge denied Google&#x27;s request to dismiss the case, ruling that they must face the group&#x27;s charges. Reuters reported that the lawsuit alleged that Google&#x27;s CEO Sundar Pichai sought to keep the users unaware of this issue.

In April 2024, it was announced that Google agreed to settle this lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement Google agreed to destroy billions of data records to settle a lawsuit claiming it secretly tracked the internet use of people who thought they were browsing privately.

==== Gender discrimination lawsuit ====
In 2017, three women sued Google, accusing the company of violating California&#x27;s Equal Pay Act by underpaying its female employees. The lawsuit cited the wage gap was around $17,000 and that Google locked women into lower career tracks, leading to smaller salaries and bonuses. In June 2022, Google agreed to pay a $118 million settlement to 15,550 female employees working in California since 2013. As a part of the settlement, Google also agreed to hire a third party to analyze its hiring and compensation practices.

====U.S. government contracts====

Following media reports about PRISM, the NSA&#x27;s massive electronic surveillance program, in June 2013, several technology companies were identified as participants, including Google. According to unnamed sources, Google joined the PRISM program in 2009, as YouTube in 2010.

Google has worked with the United States Department of Defense on drone software through the 2017 Project Maven that could be used to improve the accuracy of drone strikes. In April 2018, thousands of Google employees, including senior engineers, signed a letter urging Google CEO Sundar Pichai to end this controversial contract with the Pentagon. Google ultimately decided not to renew this DoD contract, which was set to expire in 2019.

In 2022 Google shared a $9 billion contract from the Pentagon for cloud computing with Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle.

<doc id="1092939" wikidata="Q143925" url="?curid=1092939" title="Toothache">
<text>Toothaches, also known as dental pain or tooth pain, is pain in the teeth or their supporting structures, caused by dental diseases or pain referred to the teeth by non-dental diseases. When severe it may impact sleep, eating, and other daily activities.
Common causes include inflammation of the pulp, (usually in response to tooth decay, dental trauma, or other factors), dentin hypersensitivity, apical periodontitis (inflammation of the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone around the root apex), dental abscesses (localized collections of pus), alveolar osteitis (&quot;dry socket&quot;, a possible complication of tooth extraction), acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (a gum infection), and temporomandibular disorder.

Pulpitis is reversible when the pain is mild to moderate and lasts for a short time after a stimulus (for instance cold); or irreversible when the pain is severe, spontaneous, and lasts a long time after a stimulus. Left untreated, pulpitis may become irreversible, then progress to pulp necrosis (death of the pulp) and apical periodontitis. Abscesses usually cause throbbing pain. The apical abscess usually occurs after pulp necrosis, the pericoronal abscess is usually associated with acute pericoronitis of a lower wisdom tooth, and periodontal abscesses usually represent a complication of chronic periodontitis (gum disease). Less commonly, non-dental conditions can cause toothache, such as maxillary sinusitis, which can cause pain in the upper back teeth, or angina pectoris, which can cause pain in the lower teeth. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging.
Proper oral hygiene helps to prevent toothache by preventing dental disease. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. Toothache is the most common type of pain in the mouth or face. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. In 2013, 223 million cases of toothache occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53¬†million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine. 
==Causes==
Toothache may be caused by &quot;dental&quot; (&quot;odontogenic&quot;) conditions (such as those involving the dentin-pulp complex or periodontium), or by &quot;non-dental&quot; (&quot;non-odontogenic&quot;) conditions (such as maxillary sinusitis or angina pectoris). There are many possible non-dental causes, but the vast majority of toothache is dental in origin.

Both the pulp and periodontal ligament have nociceptors (pain receptors), but the pulp lacks proprioceptors (motion or position receptors) and mechanoreceptors (mechanical pressure receptors). Consequently, pain originating from the dentin-pulp complex tends to be poorly localized, whereas pain from the periodontal ligament will typically be well localized, although not always.

For instance, the periodontal ligament can detect the pressure exerted when biting on something smaller than a grain of sand (10‚Äì30¬†Œºm). When a tooth is intentionally stimulated, about 33% of people can correctly identify the tooth, and about 20% cannot narrow the stimulus location down to a group of three teeth. Another typical difference between pulpal and periodontal pain is that the latter is not usually made worse by thermal stimuli.

===Dental===
====Pulpal====
The majority of pulpal toothache falls into one of the following types; however, other rare causes (which do not always fit neatly into these categories) include galvanic pain and barodontalgia.

====Pulpitis====
Pulpitis (inflammation of the pulp) can be triggered by various stimuli (insults), including mechanical, thermal, chemical, and bacterial irritants, or rarely barometric changes and ionizing radiation. Common causes include tooth decay, dental trauma (such as a crack or fracture), or a filling with an imperfect seal.

Because the pulp is encased in a rigid outer shell, there is no space to accommodate swelling caused by inflammation. Inflammation therefore increases pressure in the pulp system, potentially compressing the blood vessels which supply the pulp. This may lead to ischemia (lack of oxygen) and necrosis (tissue death). Pulpitis is termed &quot;reversible&quot; when the inflamed pulp is capable of returning to a state of health, and &quot;irreversible&quot; when pulp necrosis is inevitable.

Reversible pulpitis is characterized by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of dentin (tertiary dentin) have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.

====Dentin hypersensitivity====
Dentin hypersensitivity is a sharp, short-lasting dental pain occurring in about 15% of the population, which is triggered by cold (such as liquids
or air), sweet or spicy foods, and beverages. Teeth will normally have some sensation to these triggers, but what separates hypersensitivity from regular tooth sensation is the intensity of the pain. Hypersensitivity is most commonly caused by a lack of insulation from the triggers in the mouth due to gingival recession (receding gums) exposing the roots of the teeth, although it can occur after scaling and root planing or dental bleaching, or as a result of erosion. The pulp of the tooth remains normal and healthy in dentin hypersensitivity.

Many topical treatments for dentin hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed dentin surface. Treatment of the root cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of dentin inside the pulp chamber called tertiary dentin, increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed dentin surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.

====Periodontal====
In general, chronic periodontal conditions do not cause any pain. Rather, it is acute inflammation which is responsible for the pain.

=====Apical periodontitis=====

Apical periodontitis is acute or chronic inflammation around the apex of a tooth caused by an immune response to bacteria within an infected pulp. It does not occur because of pulp necrosis, meaning that a tooth that tests as if it&#x27;s alive (vital) may cause apical periodontitis, and a pulp which has become non-vital due to a sterile, non-infectious processes (such as trauma) may not cause any apical periodontitis. Bacterial cytotoxins reach the region around the roots of the tooth via the apical foramina and lateral canals, causing vasodilation, sensitization of nerves, osteolysis (bone resorption) and potentially abscess or cyst formation.

The periodontal ligament becomes inflamed and there may be pain when biting or tapping on the tooth. On an X-ray, bone resorption appears as a radiolucent area around the end of the root, although this does not manifest immediately. Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.

=====Food impaction=====

Food impaction occurs when food debris, especially fibrous food such as meat, becomes trapped between two teeth and is pushed into the gums during chewing. The usual cause of food impaction is disruption of the normal interproximal contour or drifting of teeth so that a gap is created (an open contact). Decay can lead to collapse of part of the tooth, or a dental restoration may not accurately reproduce the contact point. Irritation, localized discomfort or mild pain and a feeling of pressure from between the two teeth results. The gingival papilla is swollen, tender and bleeds when touched. The pain occurs during and after eating, and may slowly disappear before being evoked again at the next meal, or relieved immediately by using a tooth pick or dental floss in the involved area. A gingival or periodontal abscess may develop from this situation.

=====Periodontal abscess=====

A periodontal abscess (lateral abscess) is a collection of pus that forms in the gingival crevices, usually as a result of chronic periodontitis where the pockets are pathologically deepened greater than 3mm. A healthy gingival pocket will contain bacteria and some calculus kept in check by the immune system. As the pocket deepens, the balance is disrupted, and an acute inflammatory response results, forming pus. The debris and swelling then disrupt the normal flow of fluids into and out of the pocket, rapidly accelerating the inflammatory cycle. Larger pockets also have a greater likelihood of collecting food debris, creating additional sources of infection.

Periodontal abscesses are less common than apical abscesses, but are still frequent. The key difference between the two is that the pulp of the tooth tends to be alive, and will respond normally to pulp tests. However, an untreated periodontal abscess may still cause the pulp to die if it reaches the tooth apex in a periodontic-endodontic lesion. A periodontal abscess can occur as the result of tooth fracture, food packing into a periodontal pocket (with poorly shaped fillings), calculus build-up, and lowered immune responses (such as in diabetes). Periodontal abscess can also occur after periodontal scaling, which causes the gums to tighten around the teeth and trap debris in the pocket. Toothache caused by a periodontal abscess is generally deep and throbbing. The oral mucosa covering an early periodontal abscess appears erythematous (red), swollen, shiny, and painful to touch.

A variant of the periodontal abscess is the gingival abscess, which is limited to the gingival margin, has a quicker onset, and is typically caused by trauma from items such as a fishbone, toothpick, or toothbrush, rather than chronic periodontitis. The treatment of a periodontal abscess is similar to the management of dental abscesses in general (see: Treatment). However, since the tooth is typically alive, there is no difficulty in accessing the source of infection and, therefore, antibiotics are more routinely used in conjunction with scaling and root planing. The occurrence of a periodontal abscess usually indicates advanced periodontal disease, which requires correct management to prevent recurrent abscesses, including daily cleaning below the gumline to prevent the buildup of subgingival plaque and calculus.

=====Acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis=====

Common marginal gingivitis in response to subgingival plaque is usually a painless condition. However, an acute form of gingivitis/periodontitis, termed acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG), can develop, often suddenly. It is associated with severe periodontal pain, bleeding gums, &quot;punched out&quot; ulceration, loss of the interdental papillae, and possibly also halitosis (bad breath) and a bad taste. Predisposing factors include poor oral hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological stress, and immunosuppression. This condition is not contagious, but multiple cases may simultaneously occur in populations who share the same risk factors (such as students in a dormitory during a period of examination). ANUG is treated over several visits, first with debridement of the necrotic gingiva, homecare with hydrogen peroxide mouthwash, analgesics and, when the pain has subsided sufficiently, cleaning below the gumline, both professionally and at home. Antibiotics are not indicated in ANUG management unless there is underlying systemic disease.

=====Pericoronitis=====

Pericoronitis is inflammation of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which is an area that is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good oral hygiene is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.

=====Occlusal trauma=====
Occlusal trauma results from excessive biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, there may be attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.

Occlusal trauma often occurs when a newly placed dental restoration is built too &quot;high&quot;, concentrating the biting forces on one tooth. Height differences measuring less than a millimeter can cause pain. Dentists, therefore, routinely check that any new restoration is in harmony with the bite and forces are distributed correctly over many teeth using articulating paper. If the high spot is quickly eliminated, the pain disappears and there is no permanent harm. Over-tightening of braces can cause periodontal pain and, occasionally, a periodontal abscess.

=====Alveolar osteitis=====
Alveolar osteitis is a complication of tooth extraction (especially lower wisdom teeth) in which the blood clot is not formed or is lost, leaving the socket where the tooth used to be empty, and bare bone is exposed to the mouth. The pain is moderate to severe, and dull, aching, and throbbing in character. The pain is localized to the socket, and may radiate. It normally starts two to four days after the extraction, and may last 10‚Äì40 days. Healing is delayed, and it is treated with local anesthetic dressings, which are typically required for five to seven days. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine mouthwash used prior to extractions prevents alveolar osteitis.

====Combined pulpal-periodontal====
=====Dental trauma and cracked tooth syndrome=====

Cracked tooth syndrome refers to a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and has given way to the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, dentin, and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including dentin hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it&#x27;s highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).

When toothache results from dental trauma (regardless of the exact pulpal or periodontal diagnosis), the treatment and prognosis is dependent on the extent of damage to the tooth, the stage of development of the tooth, the degree of displacement or, when the tooth is avulsed, the time out of the socket and the starting health of the tooth and bone. Because of the high variation in treatment and prognosis, dentists often use trauma guides to help determine prognosis and direct treatment decisions.

The prognosis for a cracked tooth varies with the extent of the fracture. Those cracks that are irritating the pulp but do not extend through the pulp chamber can be amenable to stabilizing dental restorations such as a crown or composite resin. Should the fracture extend though the pulp chamber and into the root, the prognosis of the tooth is hopeless.

=====Periodontic-endodontic lesion=====
Apical abscesses can spread to involve periodontal pockets around a tooth, and periodontal pockets cause eventual pulp necrosis via accessory canals or the apical foramen at the bottom of the tooth. Such lesions are termed periodontic-endodontic lesions, and they may be acutely painful, sharing similar signs and symptoms with a periodontal abscess, or they may cause mild pain or no pain at all if they are chronic and free-draining. Successful root canal therapy is required before periodontal treatment is attempted. Generally, the long-term prognosis of perio-endo lesions is poor.

===Non-dental===
Non-dental causes of toothache are much less common as compared with dental causes. In a toothache of neurovascular origin, pain is reported in the teeth in conjunction with a migraine. Local and distant structures (such as ear, brain, carotid artery, or heart) can also refer pain to the teeth. Other non-dental causes of toothache include myofascial pain (muscle pain) and angina pectoris (which classically refers pain to the lower jaw). Very rarely, toothache can be psychogenic in origin.

Disorders of the maxillary sinus can be referred to the upper back teeth. The posterior, middle and anterior superior alveolar nerves are all closely associated with the lining of the sinus. The bone between the floor of the maxillary sinus and the roots of the upper back teeth is very thin, and frequently the apices of these teeth disrupt the contour of the sinus floor. Consequently, acute or chronic maxillary sinusitis can be perceived as maxillary toothache, and neoplasms of the sinus (such as adenoid cystic carcinoma) can cause similarly perceived toothache if malignant invasion of the superior alveolar nerves occurs. Classically, sinusitis pain increases upon Valsalva maneuvers or tilting the head forward.

Painful conditions which do not originate from the teeth or their supporting structures may affect the oral mucosa of the gums and be interpreted by the individual as toothache. Examples include neoplasms of the gingival or alveolar mucosa (usually squamous cell carcinoma), conditions which cause gingivostomatitis and desquamative gingivitis. Various conditions may involve the alveolar bone, and cause non-odontogenic toothache, such as Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma, infarcts in the jaws caused by sickle cell disease, and osteomyelitis. Various conditions of the trigeminal nerve can masquerade as toothache, including trigeminal zoster (maxillary or mandibular division), trigeminal neuralgia, cluster headache, and trigeminal neuropathies. Very rarely, a brain tumor might cause toothache. Another chronic facial pain syndrome which can mimic toothache is temporomandibular disorder (temporomandibular joint pain-dysfunction syndrome), which is very common. Toothache which has no identifiable dental or medical cause is often termed atypical odontalgia, which, in turn, is usually considered a type of atypical facial pain (or persistent idiopathic facial pain). Atypical odontalgia may give very unusual symptoms, such as pain which migrates from one tooth to another and which crosses anatomical boundaries (such as from the left teeth to the right teeth). 

==Pathophysiology==
A tooth is composed of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, dentin, and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth ‚Äì the crowns (covered by enamel) ‚Äì are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, dentin forms the bulk of the tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.
Enamel is not a vital tissue, as it lacks blood vessels, nerves, and living cells. Consequently, pathologic processes involving only enamel, such as shallow cavities or cracks, tend to be painless. Dentin contains many microscopic tubes containing fluid and the processes of odontoblast cells, which communicate with the pulp. Mechanical, osmotic, or other stimuli cause movement of this fluid, triggering nerves in the pulp (the &quot;hydrodynamic theory&quot; of pulp sensitivity). Due to the close relationship between dentin and pulp, they are frequently considered together as the &quot;dentin-pulp complex&quot;.
The teeth and gums exhibit normal sensations in health. Such sensations are generally sharp, lasting as long as the stimulus. There is a continuous spectrum from physiologic sensation to pain in disease. Pain is an unpleasant sensation caused by intense or damaging events. In a toothache, nerves are stimulated by either exogenous sources (for instance, bacterial toxins, metabolic byproducts, chemicals, or trauma) or endogenous factors (such as inflammatory mediators).
The pain pathway is mostly transmitted via myelinated AŒ¥ (sharp or stabbing pain) and unmyelinated C nerve fibers (slow, dull, aching, or burning pain) of the trigeminal nerve, which supplies sensation to the teeth and gums via many divisions and branches. Initially, pain is felt while noxious stimuli are applied (such as cold). Continued exposure decreases firing thresholds of the nerves, allowing normally non-painful stimuli to trigger pain (allodynia). Should the insult continue, noxious stimuli produce larger discharges in the nerve, perceived as more intense pain. Spontaneous pain may occur if the firing threshold is decreased so it can fire without stimulus (hyperalgesia). The physical component of pain is processed in the medullary spinal cord and perceived in the frontal cortex. Because pain perception involves overlapping sensory systems and an emotional component, individual responses to identical stimuli are variable.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of toothache can be challenging, not only because the list of potential causes is extensive, but also because dental pain may be extremely variable, and pain can be referred to and from the teeth. Dental pain can simulate virtually any facial pain syndrome. However, the vast majority of toothache is caused by dental, rather than non-dental, sources. Consequently, the saying &quot;horses, not zebras&quot; has been applied to the differential diagnosis of orofacial pain. That is, everyday dental causes (such as pulpitis) should always be considered before unusual, non-dental causes (such as myocardial infarction). In the wider context of orofacial pain, all cases of orofacial pain may be considered as having a dental origin until proven otherwise. The diagnostic approach for toothache is generally carried out in the following sequence: history, followed by examination, and investigations. All this information is then collated and used to build a clinical picture, and a differential diagnosis can be carried out.

===Symptoms===
The chief complaint, and the onset of the complaint, are usually important in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).

From the history, indicators of pulpal, periodontal, a combination of both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with bleeding and pain when brushing. More than one factor may be involved in the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.

Non-dental sources of pain often cause multiple teeth to hurt and have an epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, it is possible that dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual&#x27;s pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark is that there is no obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.

Irreversible pulpitis progresses to pulp necrosis, wherein the nerves are non-functional, and a pain-free period following the severe pain of irreversible pulpitis may be experienced. However, it is common for irreversible pulpitis to progress to apical periodontitis, including an acute apical abscess, without treatment. As irreversible pulpitis generates an apical abscess, the character of the toothache may simply change without any pain-free period. For instance, the pain becomes well localized, and biting on the tooth becomes painful. Hot drinks can make the tooth feel worse because they expand the gases and likewise, cold can make it feel better, thus some will sip cold water.

===Examination===
The clinical examination narrows the source down to a specific tooth, teeth, or a non-dental cause. Clinical examination moves from the outside to the inside, and from the general to the specific. Outside of the mouth, the sinuses, muscles of the face and neck, the temporomandibular joints, and cervical lymph nodes are palpated for pain or swelling. In the mouth, the soft tissues of the gingiva, mucosa, tongue, and pharynx are examined for redness, swelling or deformity. Finally, the teeth are examined. Each tooth that may be painful is percussed (tapped), palpated at the base of the root, and probed with a dental explorer for dental caries and a periodontal probe for periodontitis, then wiggled for mobility.

Sometimes the symptoms reported in the history are misleading and point the examiner to the wrong area of the mouth. For instance, sometimes people may mistake pain from pulpitis in a lower tooth as pain in the upper teeth, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. In other instances, the apparent examination findings may be misleading and lead to the wrong diagnosis and wrong treatment. Pus from a pericoronal abscess associated with a lower third molar may drain along the submucosal plane and discharge as a parulis over the roots of the teeth towards the front of the mouth (a &quot;migratory abscess&quot;). Another example is decay of the tooth root which is hidden from view below the gumline, giving the casual appearance of a sound tooth if careful periodontal examination is not carried out. 

Factors indicating infection include movement of fluid in the tissues during palpation (&quot;fluctuance&quot;), swollen lymph nodes in the neck, and fever with an oral temperature more than 37.7¬†¬∞C.

===Investigations===
Any tooth that is identified, in either the history of pain or base clinical exam, as a source for toothache may undergo further testing for vitality of the dental pulp, infection, fractures, or periodontitis. These tests may include:

* Pulp sensitivity tests, usually carried out with a cotton wool sprayed with ethyl chloride to serve as a cold stimulus, or with an electric pulp tester. The air spray from a three-in-one syringe may also be used to demonstrate areas of dentin hypersensitivity. Heat tests can also be applied with hot Gutta-percha. A healthy tooth will feel the cold but the pain will be mild and disappear once the stimulus is removed. The accuracy of these tests has been reported as 86% for cold testing, 81% for electric pulp testing, and 71% for heat testing. Because of the lack of test sensitivity, a second symptom should be present or a positive test before making a diagnosis.
* Radiographs utilized to find dental caries and bone loss laterally or at the apex.
* Assessment of biting on individual teeth (which sometimes helps to localize the problem) or the separate cusps (may help to detect cracked cusp syndrome).

Less commonly used tests might include trans-illumination (to detect congestion of the maxillary sinus or to highlight a crack in a tooth), dyes (to help visualize a crack), a test cavity, selective anaesthesia and laser doppler flowmetry.
Establishing a diagnosis of nondental toothache is initially done by careful questioning about the site, nature, aggravating and relieving factors, and referral of the pain, then ruling out any dental causes. There are no specific treatments for nondental pain (each treatment is directed at the cause of the pain, rather than the toothache itself), but a dentist can assist in offering potential sources of the pain and direct the patient to appropriate care. The most critical nondental source is the radiation of angina pectoris into the lower teeth and the potential need for urgent cardiac care.

===Differential diagnoses===
When it becomes extremely painful and decayed the tooth may be known as a hot tooth.

==Prevention==
Since most toothache is the result of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good oral hygiene. That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and interdental cleaning. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.

==Management==


There are many causes of toothache and its diagnosis is a specialist topic, meaning that attendance at a dentist is usually required. Since many cases of toothache are inflammatory in nature, over the counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may help (unless contraindicated, such as with a peptic ulcer). Generally, NSAIDs are as effective as aspirin alone or in combination with codeine. However, simple analgesics may have little effect on some causes of toothache, and the severe pain can drive individuals to exceed the maximum dose. For example, when acetaminophen (paracetamol) is taken for toothache, an accidental overdose is more likely to occur when compared to people who are taking acetaminophen for other reasons. Another risk in persons with toothache is a painful chemical burn of the oral mucosa caused by holding a caustic substance such as aspirin tablets and toothache remedies containing eugenol (such as clove oil) against the gum. Although the logic of placing a tablet against the painful tooth is understandable, an aspirin tablet needs to be swallowed to have any pain-killing effect. Caustic toothache remedies require careful application to the tooth only, without coming into excessive contact with the soft tissues of the mouth.

For the dentist, the goal of treatment generally is to relieve the pain, and wherever possible to preserve or restore function. The treatment depends on the cause of the toothache, and frequently a clinical decision regarding the current state and long-term prognosis of the affected tooth, as well as the individual&#x27;s wishes and ability to cope with dental treatment, will influence the treatment choice. Often, administration of an intra-oral local anesthetic such as lidocaine and epinephrine is indicated in order to carry out pain-free treatment. Treatment may range from simple advice, removal of dental decay with a dental drill and subsequent placement of a filling, to root canal treatment, tooth extraction, or debridement.

===Pulpitis and its sequalae===
In pulpitis, an important distinction in regard to treatment is whether the inflammation is reversible or irreversible. Treatment of reversible pulpitis is by removing or correcting the causative factor. Usually, the decay is removed, and a sedative dressing is used to encourage the pulp to return to a state of health, either as a base underneath a permanent filling or as a temporary filling intended to last for a period while the tooth is observed to see if pulpitis resolves. Irreversible pulpitis and its sequalae pulp necrosis and apical periodontitis require treatment with root canal therapy or tooth extraction, as the pulp acts as a nidus of infection, which will lead to a chronic infection if not removed. Generally, there is no difference in outcomes between whether the root canal treatment is completed in one or multiple appointments. The field of regenerative endodontics is now developing ways to clean the pulp chamber and regenerate the soft and hard tissues to either regrow or simulate pulp structure. This has proved especially helpful in children where the tooth root has not yet finished developing and root canal treatments have lower success rates.

Reversible/irreversible pulpitis is a distinct concept from whether the tooth is restorable or unrestorable, e.g. a tooth may only have reversible pulpitis, but has been structurally weakened by decay or trauma to the point that it is impossible to restore the tooth in the long term.

===Dental abscesses===
A general principle concerning dental abscesses is &quot;ubi pus, ibi evacua&quot; (&quot;where there is pus, drain it&quot;), which applies to any case where there is a collection of pus in the tissues (such as a periodontal abscess, pericoronal abscess, or apical abscess). The pus within the abscess is under pressure, and the surrounding tissues are deformed and stretched to accommodate the swelling. This leads to a sensation of throbbing (often in time with the pulse) and constant pain. Pus may be evacuated via the tooth by drilling into the pulp chamber (an endodontic access cavity). Such a treatment is sometimes termed open drainage. Drainage can also be performed via the tooth socket, once the causative tooth is extracted. If neither of those measures succeeds, or they are impossible, incision and drainage may be required, in which a small incision is made in the soft tissues directly over the abscess at the most dependent point. A surgical instrument such as a pair of tweezers is gently inserted into the incision and opened, while the abscess is massaged to encourage the pus to drain out. Usually, the reduction in pain when the pus drains is immediate and marked as the built up pressure is relieved. If the pus drains into the mouth, there is usually a bad or offensive taste.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics tend to be extensively used for emergency dental problems. As samples for microbiologic culture and sensitivity are hardly ever carried out in general dental practice, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as amoxicillin are typically used for a short course of about three to seven days. Antibiotics are seen as a &quot;quick fix&quot; by both dentists, who generally only have a very short time to manage dental emergencies, and by patients, who tend to want to avoid treatments (such as tooth extraction) which are perceived negatively. However, antibiotics typically only temporarily suppress an infection, and the need for definitive treatment is only postponed for an unpredictable length of time. An estimated 10% of all antibiotic prescriptions are made by dentists, a major factor in antibiotic resistance. They are often used inappropriately, in conditions for which they are ineffective, or their risks outweigh the benefits, such as irreversible pulpitis, apical abscess, dry socket, or mild pericoronitis. However, the reality is that antibiotics are rarely needed, and they should be used restrictively in dentistry. Local measures such as incision and drainage, and removal of the cause of the infection (such as a necrotic tooth pulp) have a greater therapeutic benefit and are much more important. If abscess drainage has been achieved, antibiotics are not usually necessary.

Antibiotics tend to be used when local measures cannot be carried out immediately. In this role, antibiotics suppress the infection until local measures can be carried out. Severe trismus may occur in when the muscles of mastication are involved in an odontogenic infection, making any surgical treatment impossible. Immunocompromised individuals are less able to fight off infections, and antibiotics are usually given. Evidence of systemic involvement (such as a fever higher than 38.5¬†¬∞C, cervical lymphadenopathy, or malaise) also indicates antibiotic therapy, as do rapidly spreading infections, cellulitis, or severe pericoronitis. Drooling and difficulty swallowing are signs that the airway may be threatened, and may precede difficulty in breathing. Ludwig&#x27;s angina and cavernous sinus thrombosis are rare but serious complications of odontogenic infections. Severe infections tend to be managed in hospital.

==Prognosis==
Most dental pain can be treated with routine dentistry. In rare cases, toothache can be a symptom representing a life-threatening condition, such as a deep neck infection (compression of the airway by a spreading odontogenic infection) or something more remote like a heart attack.

Dental caries, if left untreated, follows a predictable natural history as it nears the pulp of the tooth. First it causes reversible pulpitis, which transitions to irreversible pulpitis, then to necrosis, then to necrosis with periapical periodontitis and, finally, to necrosis with periapical abscess. Reversible pulpitis can be stopped by removal of the cavity and the placement of a sedative dressing of any part of the cavity that is near the pulp chamber. Irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis are treated with either root canal therapy or extraction. Infection of the periapical tissue will generally resolve with the treatment of the pulp, unless it has expanded to cellulitis or a radicular cyst. The success rate of restorative treatment and sedative dressings in reversible pulpitis, depends on the extent of the disease, as well as several technical factors, such as the sedative agent used and whether a rubber dam was used. The success rate of root canal treatment also depends on the degree of disease (root canal therapy for irreversible pulpitis has a generally higher success rate than necrosis with periapical abscess) and many other technical factors.

==Epidemiology==
In the United States, an estimated 12% of people reported that they had a toothache at some point in the six months before questioning. Individuals aged 18‚Äì34 reported much higher rates toothache than those aged 75 or over. In a survey of Australian schoolchildren, 12% had experienced toothache before the age of five, and 32% by the age of 12. Dental trauma is extremely common and tends to occur more often in children than adults.

Toothache may occur at any age, in any gender and in any geographic region. Diagnosing and relieving toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. Irreversible pulpitis is thought to be the most common reason that people seek emergency dental treatment. Since dental caries associated with pulpitis is the most common cause, toothache is more common in populations that are at higher risk of dental caries. The prevalence of caries in a population is dependent upon factors such as diet (refined sugars), socioeconomic status, and exposure to fluoride (such as areas without water fluoridation).

==History, society and culture==

The first known mention of tooth decay and toothache occurs on a Sumerian clay tablet now referred to as the &quot;Legend of the worm&quot;. It was written in cuneiform, recovered from the Euphrates valley, and dates from around 5000 BC. The belief that tooth decay and dental pain is caused by tooth worms is found in ancient India, Egypt, Japan, and China, and persists until the Age of Enlightenment. Although toothache is an ancient problem, it is thought that ancient people suffered less dental decay due to a lack of refined sugars in their diet. On the other hand, diets were frequently coarser, leading to more tooth wear. For example, hypotheses hold that ancient Egyptians had a lot of tooth wear due to desert sand blown on the wind mixing with the dough of their bread. The ancient Egyptians also wore amulets to prevent toothache. The Ebers papyrus (1500 BC) details a recipe to treat &quot;gnawing of the blood in the tooth&quot;, which included fruit of the gebu plant, onion, cake, and dough, to be chewed for four days.

Archigenes of Apamea describes use of a mouthwash made by boiling gallnuts and hallicacabum in vinegar, and a mixture of roasted earthworms, spikenard ointment, and crushed spider eggs. Pliny advises toothache sufferers to ask a frog to take away the pain by moonlight. Claudius&#x27; physician Scribonius Largus recommends &quot;fumigations made with the seeds of the hyoscyamus scattered on burning charcoal¬† ... followed by rinsings of the mouth with hot water, in this way¬† ... small worms are expelled.&quot;

In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is the patron saint of toothache and other dental problems. She was an early Christian martyr who was persecuted for her beliefs in Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob struck her repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, toothache sufferers who invoke her name will find relief.

In the 15th century, priest-physician Andrew Boorde describes a &quot;deworming technique&quot; for the teeth: &quot;And if it [toothache] do come by worms, make a candle of wax with Henbane seeds and light it and let the perfume of the candle enter into the tooth and gape over a dish of cold water and then you may take the worms out of the water and kill them on your nail.&quot;

Albucasis (Abu al-Qasim Khalaf ibn al-Abbas Al-Zahrawi) used cautery for toothache, inserting a red-hot needle into the pulp of the tooth. The medieval surgeon Guy de Chauliac used a camphor, sulfur, myrrh, and asafetida mixture to fill teeth and cure toothworm and toothache. French anatomist Ambroise Par√© recommended: &quot;Toothache is, of all others, the most atrocious pain that can torment a man, being followed by death. Erosion (i.e. dental decay) is the effect of an acute and acrid humour. To combat this, one must recourse to cauterization¬† ... by means of cauterization¬† ... one burns the nerve, thus rendering it incapable of again feeling or causing pain.&quot;

In the Elizabethan era, toothache was an ailment associated with lovers, as in Massinger and Fletcher&#x27;s play &quot;The False One&quot;. Toothache also appears in a number of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, such as &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. In &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Act III scene 2, when asked by his companions why he is feeling sad, a character replies that he has toothache so as not to admit the truth that he is in love. There is reference to &quot;toothworm&quot; as the cause of toothache and to tooth extraction as a cure (&quot;draw it&quot;). In Act V, scene 1, another character remarks: &quot;For there was never yet philosopher That could endure the toothache patiently.&quot; In modern parlance, this translates to the observation that philosophers are still human and feel pain, even though they claim they have transcended human suffering and misfortune. In effect, the character is rebuking his friend for trying to make him feel better with philosophical platitudes.

The Scottish poet, Robert Burns wrote &quot;Address to the Toothache&quot; in 1786, inspired after he suffered from it. The poem elaborates on the severity of toothache, describing it as the &quot;hell o&#x27; a&#x27; diseases&quot; (hell of all diseases).

A number of plants and trees include &quot;toothache&quot; in their common name. Prickly ash (Zanthoxylum americanum) is sometimes termed &quot;toothache tree&quot;, and its bark, &quot;toothache bark&quot;; whilst Ctenium Americanum is sometimes termed &quot;toothache grass&quot;, and Acmella oleracea is called &quot;toothache plant&quot;. Pellitory (Anacyclus pyrethrum) was traditionally used to relieve toothache.

In Kathmandu, Nepal, there is a shrine to Vaishya Dev, the Newar god of toothache. The shrine consists of part of an old tree to which sufferers of toothache nail a rupee coin in order to ask the god to relieve their pain. The lump of wood is called the &quot;toothache tree&quot; and is said to have been cut from the legendary tree, Bangemudha. On this street, many traditional tooth pullers still work and many of the city&#x27;s dentists have advertisements placed next to the tree.

The phrase &quot;toothache in the bones&quot; is sometimes used to describe the pain in certain types of diabetic neuropathy.

<text>Moira Kelly (born March 6, 1968) is an American actress. She is known for portraying Kate Moseley in the 1992 film &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; as well as single mother Karen Roe on the teen drama &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. She is also known for playing the role of Donna Hayward in &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;, replacing Lara Flynn Boyle in the prequel to the 1990 TV series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Other roles include Dorothy Day in &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot;, White House media consultant Mandy Hampton in the first season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and the adult voice of Simba&#x27;s love interest Nala in &quot;The Lion King&quot; and its direct-to-video sequels &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; and &quot;The Lion King 1¬Ω&quot;. She also played Hetty Kelly and Oona O&#x27;Neill in &quot;Chaplin&quot;.

==Early life==
Moira Kelly was born in Queens, New York on March 6, 1968. She is the daughter of a trained concert violinist, Peter, and a nurse, Anne, who are Irish immigrants. Kelly is the third of six children and was raised in Ronkonkoma, New York. She was brought up as a Catholic. Kelly attended Connetquot Senior High School in Bohemia, Long Island, graduating in the class of 1986. Later, she attended Marymount Manhattan College.

In her youth, Kelly was cast in a small role in her high school&#x27;s 1984 production of &quot;Annie&quot;. Due to illness, the girl playing Miss Hannigan was replaced, causing a series of cast changes leading to her choice of career. A devout Catholic, Kelly had to decide between acting and her childhood ambition of becoming a nun.

==Career==
Kelly made her professional acting debut in the fact-based made-for-TV movie &quot;Love, Lies and Murder&quot;, playing teenager Cinnamon Brown, who was coerced by her father into killing his wife and her stepmother, Linda Brown. She was originally going to have a starring role as Polly Pry in Trey Parker and Matt Stone&#x27;s &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;, but Kelly was convinced not to do so by her agent out of concerns it could potentially ruin her career, and was ultimately replaced with Toddy Walters, though she was still credited in the end credits under her initials &quot;M.K.&quot; as &quot;the Dropout&quot;. She went on to have small roles in the films &quot;The Boy Who Cried Bitch&quot;, &quot;Hi-Life&quot;, and &quot;Billy Bathgate&quot; before being cast as Donna Hayward in &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot;. For that film, she went home and got permission from her priest because of an explicit sex scene. In the same year, she starred opposite D. B. Sweeney in the romantic comedy &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;(during whose filming Kelly suffered a broken ankle, which cost her a part in Penny Marshall&#x27;s film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;) and played two roles opposite Robert Downey Jr. in &quot;Chaplin&quot;. According to a &quot;TV Guide&quot; interview, before taking on her role in &quot;Daybreak&quot;, Kelly once again asked her priest for advice: &quot;Being a Catholic, I wondered if it would be against my religion to play a girl who has premarital sex.&quot; The priest told her &quot;it was okay, as long as my artistic intentions were true and I wasn&#x27;t doing it for the notoriety or the money.&quot;

She has since appeared in the films &quot;With Honors&quot;, &quot;Little Odessa&quot;, &quot;The Tie That Binds&quot;, and &quot;Dangerous Beauty&quot;, amongst others, and provided the adult voice of Nala in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot;, and &quot;The Lion King 1¬Ω&quot;. In her independent film career, Kelly had the starring role of activist Dorothy Day in &quot;Entertaining Angels: The Dorothy Day Story&quot; and starred alongside Glenn Close in &quot;The Safety of Objects&quot;. She played Helen Keller in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Monday After the Miracle&quot;, which broadcast on November 15, 1998, on CBS.

Kelly starred in the CBS drama &quot;To Have &amp; to Hold&quot; opposite Jason Beghe before playing Mandy Hampton in the first season of &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In 2003, Kelly began playing single mother Karen Roe on the teen drama &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;. She also directed two episodes of the series: &quot;Resolve&quot; (2007) and &quot;I Slept with Someone in Fall Out Boy and All I Got Was This Stupid Song Written About Me&quot; (2006). In the fifth season, she ceased to be a regular cast member, but made guest appearances in the 100th episode and the sixth-season finale. She has made guest appearances in television shows such as &quot;Heroes&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and &quot;Numb3rs&quot;. Kelly has also appeared in the films &quot;Remember the Daze&quot;, &quot;A Smile as Big as the Moon&quot;, &quot;Taken Back: Finding Haley&quot;, and &quot;Girl in the Bunker&quot;.

Kelly reprised her role of Nala from the Disney animated movie series &quot;The Lion King&quot; in adventure video game Disney Dreamlight Valley released in 2023.

==Personal life==
On August 5, 2000, Kelly married Steve Hewitt, a Texas businessman. They have two children, a daughter Ella and a son Eamon. Kelly had previously maintained a residence in Wilmington, North Carolina, for eleven years.
