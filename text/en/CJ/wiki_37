<text>The Chevrolet Chevy II/Nova is a small automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, and produced in five generations for the 1962 through 1979, and 1985 through 1988 model years. Built on the X-body platform, the Nova was the top selling model in the Chevy II lineup through 1968. The Chevy II nameplate was dropped after 1968, with Nova becoming the nameplate for all of the 1969 through 1979 models. It was replaced by the 1980 Chevrolet Citation introduced in the spring of 1979. The Nova nameplate returned in 1985, produced through 1988 as a S-car based, NUMMI manufactured, subcompact based on the front wheel drive, Japan home-based Toyota Sprinter.

== History ==

=== Origin ===
Chevrolet designer Clare MacKichan recalled about creating the Chevy II: &quot;There was no time for experimentation or doodling around with new ideas from either the engineers or from us in design; And it had to be a basic-type car.&quot; The 1962 Chevy II rode a wheelbase, compared to for the Ford Falcon, at which Chevy&#x27;s new compact was aimed. &quot;I think that was the quickest program we ever did at any time,&quot; he continued. &quot;We worked night and day on that car, and it didn&#x27;t take very long to run it through our shop because we had a deadline.&quot; And that is what made the Chevy II one of the fastest new-car development programs in GM history – just 18 months after the designers got the green light, the first production Chevy II rolled off the Willow Run, Michigan, assembly line in August 1961, in time for its September 29 introduction. Unlike the Corvair, the 1962 Chevy II design team deliberately avoided any revolutionary features in concept or execution; their mission was to give Chevrolet buyers a simple, back-to-the-basics compact car. When he announced the Chevy II to the press, Chevrolet General Manager Ed Cole described the car as offering &quot;maximum functionalism with thrift.&quot; When the Chevy II was introduced, it was the second post-WWII American made car from the &quot;Big 3&quot;, after the Pontiac Tempest (and the first Chevrolet since the 1928 Chevrolet National), to use a four-cylinder engine.

There was a lot of debate within the Chevrolet organization over just what to call this new car, and the decision to go with &quot;Chevy II&quot; was a very late one. Among the finalists was Nova. It lost out because it didn&#x27;t start with a &quot;C,&quot; but was selected as the name for the top-of-the-line series. Ultimately the Nova badge would replace Chevy II, but that wouldn&#x27;t happen until 1969. In almost every way, the creators of the Chevy II used Falcon as a benchmark. The 1962 model range included sedans and wagons, as well as a two-door hardtop and a convertible. The only body styles it didn&#x27;t offer which the Falcon did were a 2-door wagon/sedan delivery and coupe utility (the Ford Falcon Ranchero).

== First generation (1962–1965) ==

After the rear-engine Chevrolet Corvair was outsold by the conventional Ford Falcon in 1960, Chevrolet completed work on a more conventional compact car that would eventually become the Chevy II. The car was of semi-unibody construction having a bolt on front section joined to its unitized cabin and trunk rear section, available in two- and four-door sedan configurations as well as convertible and 4-door station wagon versions. The 1962 Chevy II came in three series and five body styles—the 100 Series, 300 Series and Nova 400 Series. A 200 series was also introduced, but was discontinued almost immediately. The sportiest-looking of the lot was the US$2,475 ($ in dollars ) Nova 400 convertible—23,741 were produced that year.

Available engines for the Chevy II in 1962 and 1963 included Chevrolet&#x27;s inline-four engine of and a new &quot;Hi-Thrift&quot; straight-six engine. All Chevy II engines featured overhead valves. 

In 1962 and 1963 the Nova option for the Chevy II was available in a convertible body style, and a two-door hardtop was available from 1962 to 1965, although the hardtop was dropped when the 1964 models were first introduced, but subsequently brought back to the line later in the model year. Like all Chevy two-door hardtops, the body style was marketed as the Sport Coupe.

For 1963, the Chevy II Nova Super Sport was released, under RPO Z03.&lt;ref name=&quot;Super Chevy, 5/94, p.14&quot;&gt;&quot;Super Chevy&quot;, 5/94, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; It featured special emblems, instrument package, wheel covers, side moldings, bucket seats, and floor shifter, and was available only on the 400 series sport coupe and convertible. Cost of the package was US$161.40, equal to $ today. As mentioned above, the Nova option could not officially have V8 engines at this time—the standard SS engine was the six-cylinder (this was also applicable to the Impala (and later the early Chevelle c. 1964–65) when the SS was a sport and appearance package)—but small-block V8 engine swaps were commonplace among enthusiasts.

For 1964, sales were hit hard by the introduction of the new Chevelle, and the Chevy II received its first factory V8 option, a , as well as a straight six. The six-cylinder was all-new, replacing the older Stovebolt engine. Rival manufacturer Chrysler had earlier developed the Slant Six in their Plymouth Valiant, a Chevy II competitor, when the cars were introduced to the public in late 1959 as 1960 models. At introduction in the fall, the hardtop coupe was missing in the lineup, contributing to a loss of sales (as well as showroom appeal). Chevrolet subsequently reintroduced the Sport Coupe in the lineup later in the model year, and it remained available through 1967.

The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were updated with cleaner front-end styling courtesy of a fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. Parking lights moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauges.
An expanded engine lineup gave customers six power choices of the six-cylinder or V-8 engines; the four-cylinder was available only in the 100. But, for Chevy II enthusiasts, 1965 is best remembered as the year the Chevy II became a muscle car. A V8 was available with up to , suddenly putting Nova SS performance practically on a par with the GTO, 4-4-2, and 271 bhp Mustang 289s-at least in straight-line acceleration. Midyear also brought a more potent 283 with dual exhausts and 220 horsepower.

The Chevelle Malibu SS continued to eat away at the Nova SS market: Out of 122,800 Chevy IIs built for 1965 (compared to 213,601 Falcons), only 9,100 were Super Sports. For 1965, Chevy II had the dubious distinction of being the only car in GM&#x27;s lineup to suffer a sales decline. It is possible that some Chevy II sales were lost to the brand-new &#x27;65 Corvair, which addressed virtually all its 1960–64 problems, got rave reviews from automotive journals and featured sleek new (Z-body) styling along with a brand-new chassis.


== Second generation (1966–1967) ==

1966 Chevy IIs introduced an extensive sharp-edged restyle based in part on the Super Nova concept car. In general, proportions were squared up but dimensions and features changed little. Highlights included a bold grille and semi-fastback roofline. &quot;Humped&quot; fenders in an angular rear end were reminiscent of larger 1966 Chevrolets, though the 1966 Chevy II and Nova had vertical taillights and single headlights. The lineup again started with Chevy II 100 and Chevy II Nova 400 models.


For just $159 (equal to $ today) more than a Nova 400, buyers could choose a Super Sport. Available only in a Sport Coupe, the SS was top of the line. The inline-six was standard on the Super Sport, but any Chevy II (excluding four-cylinder) engine could be coupled with the SS. The SS was visually distinguished by wide rocker panels and a bright aluminum deck lid cove. It had a bright SS emblem on the grille and in the ribbed rear panel, and Super Sport script on the quarter panels. Wheel covers were inherited from the 1965 Malibu SS. Strato-bucket front seats were included, but a tachometer cost extra. The ’66 Chevy II sales brochure clearly promoted the Super Sport as the “Chevrolet Chevy II Nova Super Sport,” but the name &quot;Nova&quot; was not used anywhere on the body. Front and rear emblems displayed &quot;Chevy II SS.&quot; In 1967, Chevy II was still the name of the vehicle, but the Nova SS option package replaced all Chevy II badging with Nova SS badging.

The inline-four engine was only offered in the base Chevy II 100 series models. Buyers could also order a inline-six engine (std. in the SS), a inline-six, a or V-8, a V-8 and the top engine, a new Turbo-Fire V-8 delivering . This engine was first seen in the Chevelle. This engine with the close-ratio four-speed manual transmission turned the normally mild Nova into a proper muscle car. The Powerglide automatic was not available with the 350 hp engine.

The 1967 models received nothing more than a touch-up after a restyling for 1966. All Novas got a crosshatch pattern that filled the deck lid trim panel. The Nova officially was still called the Chevy II Nova and had overtaken the bottom-rung Chevy II 100 in sales. The Chevy II 100 lacked much in the way of trim or brightwork. 1967 models carried significant improvements in the area of safety equipment. A government-mandated energy-absorbing steering column and safety steering wheel, soft interior parts such as armrests and sun visors, recessed instrument panel knobs, front seat belt anchors and dual brake master cylinders, were included in all 1967 models.

The 1967 Chevy II and its deluxe Nova rendition continued to attract compact-car shoppers, but the Chevrolet Camaro, introduced for 1967, took away some Nova sales. Available only in hardtop coupe form, the 1967 Chevrolet Nova SS got a new black-accented anodized aluminum grille. SS wheel covers were again inherited, this time from the 1965–66 Impala SS. The 1966 &quot;Chevy II SS&quot; badges were replaced with &quot;Nova SS&quot; emblems for the &#x27;67s. Nova versions started with the in-line six engine but new was an optional inline-six. Further powertrain options included a V-8 and, for $93 more, a V-8. Nova SS coupes had a console-mounted shift lever with their Powerglide automatic transmission or a four-speed manual. Other models had a column-mounted gearshift. Compared to the 1966 model year output, sales of the 1967 models dropped by more than a third to 106,500 (including 12,900 station wagons). About 10,100 Nova SS Chevrolets went to customers this year, 8,200 of them with V-8 engines. In the Chevy II 100 and regular Nova series, six-cylinder engines sold far better than V-8s.


== Third generation (1968–1974) ==

The 1968 models were fully-redesigned with an extensive restyle on a longer 111-inch wheelbase that gave Chevrolet&#x27;s compacts a chassis that was just one inch shorter than that of the midsize Chevelle coupe. The station wagon and hardtop sport coupe were discontinued, the former in line with an industry trend which left AMC the only American maker of compact station wagons until Chrysler rejoined the market in 1976 (the 1966–70 Ford Falcon wagon was actually midsize, using a bodyshell identical to the Fairlane wagon&#x27;s).
One notable change was the front subframe assembly — as compared with Ford, Chrysler and AMC, in whose cars the entire front suspension was integrated with the bodyshell, a separate subframe housing the powertrain and front suspension (similar to the front part of the frame of GM&#x27;s full-size, full-framed vehicles) replaced the earlier style. Although the front subframe design was unique for the Nova, the Camaro introduced a year earlier was the first to incorporate such a design; the redesigned Nova was pushed a year ahead to 1968 instead of 1969. The sales brochure claimed 15 powertrain choices for coupes and a dozen for sedans. Options included power brakes and steering, Four-Season or Comfort-Car air conditioning, rear shoulder belts, and head restraints. There were a few Chevrolet Novas built with the 194 ci (3.1 L), the same motor that had been used in the previous generations of the Chevy II. Sales of the 1968 Chevy II Nova fell by half.

In 1969 Chevrolet dropped the Chevy II portion of its compact car&#x27;s name; it was now known simply as the Chevrolet Nova.
The four-cylinder engine was offered between 1968 and 1970, then was dropped due to lack of interest (besides its other usage in the Jeep DJ-5A a.k.a. the Postal Jeep or a marine/industrial engine) and to clear the field for the Vega. Far more popular were the six-cylinder and the base V8, which replaced the V8 offered in previous years. Several units were produced with the , , engine, four-barrel quadrajet carb and four-speed Saginaw transmission with a heavy-duty 12-bolt positraction rear as a &quot;towing option&#x27; package. At mid-year, a semi-automatic transmission based on the Powerglide called the &quot;Torque-Drive&quot; (RPO MB1) was introduced as a low-cost option (~$100 less than the Powerglide) for clutchless motoring. The &quot;Torque-Drive&quot; transmission was only offered with the four and six-cylinder engines. The two-speed Powerglide was still the only fully-automatic transmission available with most engines, as the more desirable three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic was only available with the largest V8 engines.

=== Nova SS ===

The Nova Super Sport was transformed from a trim option to a performance package for 1968. One of the smallest muscle cars ever fielded by Detroit, the Nova SS now included a V8 engine along with a heavy-duty suspension and other performance hardware, priced at US$312. Optional V8 engines included two versions of the big-block rated at ; and at 5600 rpm and at 3600 rpm of torque, which went for US$348. Both engines were offered with a choice of transmissions including the M-21 close-ratio four-speed manual, the heavy-duty M-22 &quot;Rock Crusher&quot; four-speed manual, or the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 400 automatic transmission. A total of 5,571 SS coupés were produced for 1968. Novas sported the SS badge until 1976. Front disc brakes were optional on the 1968 Nova SS. Strangely enough, also in 1968, and in 1969, Pontiac would have their Canadian division overtake both of the Acadian and Beaumont divisions of General Motors in Canada, and they too would have their own variant of the Nova Super Sport that they referred to as the Pontiac Acadian SS (Super Sport).

=== 1969–1972 ===
For 1969 the Chevy II nameplate was retired, leaving the Nova nameplate. The &quot;Chevy II by Chevrolet&quot; trunklid badge was replaced with &quot;Nova by Chevrolet,&quot; the &quot;Chevy II&quot; badge above the grille was replaced with the bowtie emblem, and the 1969 model was promoted under the Nova model name in Chevrolet sales literature.

As with other 1969 GM vehicles, locking steering columns were incorporated into the Nova. Simulated air extractor/vents were added below the Nova script, which was relocated to the front fender behind the wheel-well instead of the rear quarter panel. The V8 with four-barrel carburetor that came standard with the SS option was revised with a increase to , while a two-barrel carbureted version of the V8 rated at was a new option on non-SS models. The SS option price remained US$312 A new Turbo-Hydramatic 350 three-speed automatic was made available for non-SS Novas with six-cylinder and V8 engines, although the older two-speed Powerglide continued to be available on the smaller-engined Novas. 1969 SS models were the first Nova SS models to have standard front disc brakes.

The 1970 Nova was basically a carryover from 1969. The side marker and taillight lenses for the 1970 Nova were wider and positioned slightly differently. This was the final year for the SS396 (actually, a 402 cubic in. engine now). All other engines were carried over including the seldom-ordered four-cylinder which was in its final year. The car finally became simply the Chevrolet Nova this year after two years of transitional nameplates (Chevy II Nova in 1968 and Chevrolet Chevy Nova in 1969). Out of 254,242 Novas sold for 1970, 19,558 were the SS 350 or SS 396 version. Approximately 177 Central Office Production Order (COPO) Novas were ordered, with 175 converted by Yenko Chevrolet. The other two were sold in Canada. The Nova was used in Trans-Am racing this year.

Year 1971 Novas were similar to the previous year. The engine was replaced with the in the SS model. 1971 also saw the introduction of the Rally Nova, a trim level that only lasted two years (until it resurfaced as the Nova Rally in 1977). The Rally kit included black or white stripes that ran the length of the car and between the taillights in the back, a Rally Nova sticker on the driver&#x27;s side of the hood, 6-slot 14X6&quot; Rally wheels, heavy duty suspension with mono-leaf or multi-leaf in the rear depending on optional equipment ordered., and a &quot;sport&quot; body colored driver&#x27;s side mirror that was adjustable from the interior. The well-hyped Vega stole sales from the Nova this year, but the compact soon would enjoy a resurgence of popularity that would last deep into the 1970s. A mid-year production change was the front door hinges spot welded to the A-pillar and the door shell, a design shared with the Vega and later implemented by GM&#x27;s subsequent light-duty trucks and vans which later was used with the S10, Astro van, and full-size trucks commencing with the GMT400 a decade later.

The six-cylinder engine was now the standard Nova engine with the demise of the four-cylinder and six-cylinder engines. The and V8s were carried over from 1970 and all engines featured lowered compression ratios to enable the use of unleaded gasoline as a result of a GM corporate mandate that took effect with the 1971 model year.

After 1971, other GM divisions began rebadging the Nova as their new entry-level vehicle, such as the Pontiac Ventura II (once a trim option for full-size Pontiacs to 1970), Oldsmobile Omega and the Buick Apollo. This was considered to build brand loyalty with respective GM divisions although the company later fused their badge engineering with platform sharing to cut expenditures. The initials of the four model names spelled out the acronym &quot;NOVA&quot; (&quot;N&quot;ova, &quot;O&quot;mega, &quot;V&quot;entura, &quot;A&quot;pollo). The 1973 introduction of the Omega and Apollo coincided with the subsequent oil crisis where sales of the X and H platform increased.

The 1972 Nova received only minor trim changes. The Rally package option with heavy duty suspension returned and was a rather popular choice, with 33,319 sold. SuperSport equipment went on 12,309 coupes. Nova production moved to Norwood, Ohio, where it would be assembled alongside the Camaro. At mid-year, a sunroof option called the Sky Roof became available on two-door models. Also, the optional Strato bucket seats available on coupes switched from the previous low-back design with adjustable headrests to the high back units with built-in headrests introduced the previous year on Camaros and Vegas. Despite the lack of change, Nova had its best sales season in years, with the production of the 1972 models reaching 349,733. Of these, 139,769 had the six-cylinder engine.

=== Rally Nova 1971-1972 ===
Mid 1971 saw the introduction of the Rally Nova(RPO-YF1) available with the Nova coupe (X27) model only. The Rally Nova option was basically an appearance option but did include heavy duty front and rear suspension (RPO-F40) which could be mono-leaf or multi-leaf in the rear depending on optional equipment ordered. The Rally Nova was a would-be Muscle Car. It had the look of a Muscle Car with stripes, black grill, left hand sport mirror and 14X6&quot; 6-slot Rally wheels but it could not be ordered with the SS-only Turbo-Fire 350 V8 4V (RPO-L48) engine. This was done for two reasons, people who wanted the Muscle Car look could have it without paying for the more expensive Super Sport option. The other reason was because of insurance surcharges that applied to owners of &quot;real&quot; Muscle Cars. The SS was more expensive to insure because of the 200 hp Turbo-Fire 350 V8 engine.


The Rally Nova option included black or white tapered stripe decals that ran the length of the car with &quot;Rally Nova&quot; wording in the stripes toward the rear of both quarter panels. A stripe decal between the taillights on the back, a &quot;Rally Nova&quot; decal on the driver&#x27;s side of the hood, 6-slot 14x6&quot; Rally wheels with special center caps, driver&#x27;s side body colored remote adjustable Sport mirror, black painted grill with bright upper and lower horizontal bars, black accent headlight bezels, bright roof drip moldings and color-keyed floor carpeting.

Available engines for the Rally Nova were the Turbo-Thrift 250 L6 1V (RPO-L22), Turbo-Fire 307 V8 2V (RPO-L14) and Turbo-Fire 350 V8 2V (RPO-L65). Available transmissions were 3-Speed manual (RPO-ZW4) (all engines), Powerglide automatic (RPO-M35) (standard engines only) and the Turbo-Hydra-matic automatic (RPO-M40) (V8 only). The Rally Nova only came with 2&quot; single exhaust since the 2-1/4&quot; dual exhaust was reserved for the SS-only 200 hp Turbo-Fire 350 V8 4V (RPO-L48).

Optional interior trim levels Custom (RPO-ZJ1) and Special (RPO-ZJ3) could be ordered. Custom Exterior (RPO-ZJ2/YF8) and Exterior Decor Package (RPO-ZJ5) were not available when the Rally Nova was ordered. This means bright rear panel trim plate, bright side window moldings, sill moldings, fender moldings, side molding and accent striping would have never come on a Rally Nova. The only allowed exterior options were a vinyl roof (RPO-C08), engine badges for 307 or 350 engines and for mid 1972 the newly available Sky Roof.

Other available optional accessories and equipment that could be had with the Rally Nova included - Sport steering wheel (RPO-NK4), vinyl rim steering wheel (RPO-NK2), color-keyed floor mats - front and rear (RPO-B37), color-keyed seat belts front, shoulder and rear (RPO-AK1), AM (RPO-U63) or AM/FM (RPO-U69) radios, windshield antenna (RPO-U76), rear speaker (RPO-U80), clock (RPO-U35), special instrumentation (RPO-U17)(Required V8 coupe with bucket seats and console), rear window defogger (RPO-C50), auxiliary lighting (RPO-ZJ9), A/C (RPO-C60)(with V8 engine only), bucket seats (RPO-A51), console (RPO-D55) (with bucket seats only), softray tinted glass (RPO-A01), trailering rear axle 3:42 ratio (RPO-YD1), positraction (RPO-G80), wheel trim rings (RPO-P06), power drum brakes (RPO-J50), power disk brakes (RPO-JL2), E78X14 bias ply belted single white stripe tires (RPO-PL3), power steering (RPO-N40), front and rear bumper guards (RPO-V30) , heavy duty radiator (RPO-V01) and heavy duty battery (RPO-T60).

Production numbers for the Rally Nova were 7,700 built in 1971 and 33,319 in 1972 of 403,450 total Nova 2-door coupes produced from 1971-1972.

=== Yenko Novas ===
Retired race car driver and muscle car specialist Don Yenko of Yenko Chevrolet in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, refitted a series of third-generation Novas, as well as Chevelles and Camaros for optimum performance to compete with the frontrunning Ford Mustangs, Plymouth Barracudas and Dodge Challengers. The specially redesigned Nova (sometimes known as the &quot;Yenko Supernova&quot;) had a stronger body frame and suspension system to house the powerful and heavy 427cid (7.0 L) V8 engine that powered the Yenko Super Cars. Only 37 were known to be produced with an original selling price of $4,000.00. Today, only seven units are registered and known to exist. In 1970, emissions standards and fuel economy were taking a toll on muscle cars. To counter this, Yenko requested a high-output Chevy 350cid V8 in his special line of Novas, the same engine that the new Z-28 Camaro and LT1 Corvette shared. Additionally, the new &quot;Yenko Deuce&quot;, as it was known, had extensive suspension, transmission, and rear axle upgrades along with some very lively stripes, badges, and interior decals.

=== Facelift (1973–1974) ===
The 1973 model year introduced a hatchback body style based on the 2-door coupe. The front and rear of the Nova were restyled, following a government mandate for vehicles to be fitted with front bumpers capable of withstanding impacts and rear bumpers capable of absorbing impacts. To go along with the bigger bumpers, stylists gave the Nova a new grille with a loosely patterned crosshatch insert and parking lights located inboard of the headlights. In 1974, the rear bumper could absorb 5 mph impacts. Fuel tank capacity increased to 21 gallons, which required a redesigned trunk pan where a circular section was stamped to house the space-saver spare tire used on hatchback models.

An SS option remained available, but it was merely a $123 dress-up package that included a blackout grille and Rally wheels. It could be ordered with any of the Nova engines. 35,542 SS packages were installed, making 1973 the best-selling year for the option. A modified rear side window shape was also introduced, eliminating the vent windows on both two- and four-door models. A revised rear suspension was adapted from the second generation Camaro with multi-leaf springs replacing the mono-leaf springs used on Novas since the original 1962 model. By this time, six-cylinder and V8 engines were &quot;de rigueur&quot; for American compact cars, with the and V8s becoming fairly common. The 1973 Nova with a six-cylinder engine or 307 cu. in. (5.0 L) V8 were among the last Chevrolets to be offered with the two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, which was in its final year. A dressy Custom series (which became a mid-level trim package in 1975) joined the Nova line and a Custom hatchback listed for $2,701 with a six-cylinder engine. That was $173 more than the six-cylinder base-model two-door hatchback. Air conditioning added $381. Every 1973 Chevrolet Nova got side guard door beams and additional sound insulation, as well as flow-through ventilation systems. A sunroof could be installed, and fold-down rear seats were available.

For 1974, the Chevrolet Nova got a centered bow-tie grille emblem, as well as modified bumpers that added two inches to the length and helped cushion minor impacts. The Powerglide was replaced by a lightweight version of the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 ( THM 250 ) already offered with the V8, which was the only V8 offered for 1974. Nova sales continued the surge they had enjoyed since 1972 and approached 400,000 cars for 1974. Six-cylinder Novas were the fastest gainers, as sales of V-8 Novas declined. These were the years of the first energy crisis as Middle Eastern countries cut back on oil exports. After waiting for hours in gas lines and fretting about the prospect of fuel rationing, thrifty compacts looked pretty good to plenty of Americans and it fit the bill.

The &#x27;Spirit of America&#x27; Nova was introduced in 1974. In anticipation of the US bicentennial in 1976, the limited edition Nova Coupes were painted white and featured blue and red accent stripes as well as red and blue interior carpets and fabrics. Oldsmobile and Buick entered the compact car market; both the Apollo and Omega debuted, using the same body styles from the Nova lineup. Additional options were included on these Nova-like models, such as lighting under the dashboard and in the glove compartment. Pontiac&#x27;s final GTO of this era was based on a facelifted 1974 Ventura coupe, itself based on the Nova, but fitted with a shaker hood scoop from the Trans Am.

Novas and all 1974 cars were fitted with a weight-sensitive relay within the front seat that prevented the vehicle from being started until the driver&#x27;s seatbelt had been fastened, following a safety mandate from the NHTSA. Later, Congress repealed the mandate requiring this type of device, declaring that it infringed on a driver&#x27;s freedom of choice, and allowed owners of 1974-model cars to have the seat belt interlock bypassed. The devices were not included in future Nova models. Along with this controversial seat belt interlock, a new, more convenient &quot;inertial reel&quot; one-piece lap/shoulder safety belt assembly was standard for both front outboard passengers, along with a plastic clip attached to the headrest to guide the belt across the wearer&#x27;s shoulder.

=== Prices ===
Original manufacturers sales prices for the third generation Nova were:



== Fourth generation (1975–1979) ==
The 1975 Chevrolet Nova was the most-changed Chevy car for that model year. &quot;Now it&#x27;s beautiful,&quot; said the brochure of Nova&#x27;s all-new sheet metal, &quot;refined along the lines of elegant European sedans.&quot; Chevrolet wisely maintained a visual kinship with the 1968–1974 design, and also retained Nova&#x27;s efficiently sized 111-inch wheelbase. Front tread grew by an inch and a half, and the front stabilizer bar had a larger diameter. Novas now had standard front disc brakes and steel-belted radial tires. The front suspension and subframe assembly was similar to the one used in the second generation GM F-body cars (the Camaro and Pontiac Firebird), whereas the rear axle and suspension were carried over from the previous generation. Coupes, including the hatchback, had fixed side windows (or optional flip-out windows) - the first for a GM vehicle later optioned throughout the 1980s with its light duty trucks (S10, Astro/Safari, and GMT400 trucks to the K2XX series) and vertical vents on the B-pillar. All Novas now had cut-pile carpeting, formerly installed only in the Custom series. Speedometers had larger, easier-to-read graphics. Windshields offered greater glass area. Front-door armrests were redesigned with integral pull bars. The base model carried the inline six-cylinder , , three V8 engines (, a 1975-only option, a and a ) for 1976 only, were offered. Mated to a three-speed automatic, 3-speed manual or 4-speed – V8s only – Which remained the norm through the end of the decade (and the end of the rear-wheel drive X platform). By then, Cadillac had developed its own version of the X-body, called the K-body which was named the Seville, whose styling was distinct from those of its corporate cousins, and Buick replaced the Apollo with the Skylark name that had been inactive since the previous incarnation ended production at the end of the 1972 model year.

The LN (Luxury Nova) package (which was the top luxury trim similar to the Caprice and Malibu Classic) sent Nova into the luxury portion of the compact market; some actually thought of it as competing against a few high-end European imports. The Nova LN was called &quot;the most luxurious compact in Chevrolet&#x27;s history,&quot; with wide-back reclining front seats that &quot;look and feel like big, soft lounge chairs.&quot; LN equipment included ad­ditional sound insulation, map pockets, an electric clock, a smoked instrument lens, floor shifter and center console, and a day/night mirror. Taillight lenses have additional white accents unavailable with the base model and a chrome plated grille. Above the front marker lenses, the LN had 4.3 LITER (or 5.7 LITER) decals - making it the first Chevrolet product with metric displacement badges sold in the Americas. Swing-out quarter windows could be ordered for the coupe. &quot;Thanks to LN,&quot; the sales brochure announced, &quot;Nova&#x27;s image will never be the same again.&quot; The LN was more Eurocentric as opposed to the Custom which became the mid-level trim option.

For 1976 the Nova LN was rebranded Concours to rival the Ford Granada and the Mercury Monarch, as well as upscale versions of the Dodge Dart and Plymouth Valiant. Like regular versions of the 1976 Nova, the Concours came in three body styles: coupe, hatchback coupe, and four-door sedan. Concours was the most luxurious Chevrolet compact to date. Rosewood vinyl decorated the upper door panels, instrument panel, and steering wheel. Concours models had an upright hood ornament, bumper guards, bright trim moldings, black bumper impact strips, and full wheel covers; more-basic Novas came with hubcaps. The Concours coupe also was the first Chevrolet coupe with a fold-down front center armrest. A V8 Concours coupe sold for $547 more than the comparable base Nova. Engines for the 1976 Chevrolet Nova were a 105-horsepower inline-six, a 165-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V-8, or a 140-horse 305-cubic-inch V-8. 1976 GM vehicles first saw use of the THM200 — from the GM T platform to GM X-Bodies (Chevrolet Nova et al.). A lighter duty, 10-bolt rear differential with a 7.5&quot; ring gear (also used with the Vega/Monza and produced until 2005) was phased into production - being standard equipment with the base inline-six. A &quot;Cabriolet&quot; padded vinyl top was available for Nova coupes. Modest revisions were made to the brakes, and also to fuel and exhaust system mountings. Dashboards contained new knobs. After testing the 1976 Chevrolet Nova, the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department placed the largest order for compact police cars ever seen in the U.S.

The $187 Nova SS option group included a black grille with unique diamond-mesh pattern, Rally wheels, four-spoke steering wheel, and heavy-duty suspension.

Minor changes for the 1977 model year included a more modern round gauge cluster to replace the long sweeping speedometer, and a revised dash panel which changed to a flatter design. Some new colors were offered (as with the rest of the divisions) and some small trim added. A separate brochure was printed for the Concours while the &quot;1977 Nova&quot; brochure detailed only base and Custom versions. The Nova SS previously offered for 1975 and 1976 was discontinued, the option code for the SS — RPO Z26 — continued as the Nova Rally from 1977 through 1979. A badged-engineered Nova Malibu Rallye (1977 and 1978 model years – not related to the USA market Chevelle-based model and based on the Nova hatchback coupe) was sold in Mexico using the RPO Z26 package but fitted with &#x27;Malibu Rallye&#x27; graphics and a front grille emblem.

Three engines and four transmissions were available for every 1977 Chevrolet Nova, including Concours. Buyers could choose from a 110-horsepower 250-cubic-inch inline six, a 145-horsepower 305 cubic-inch two-barrel V-8, or 170-horsepower 350 cubic-inch four-barrel V-8. Shifting was accomplished by three-speed (column or floor shift) and four-speed manuals or Turbo Hydra-Matic. Novas might also be equipped with a heavy-duty suspension or the F41 sport suspension. A surprising number of police departments ordered Novas with either a 305- or 350-cubic-inch V-8 engine, following the lead of the Los Angeles Sheriff&#x27;s Department, which had given the compacts an exhaustive evaluation.


Promoted as &quot;Concours by Chevrolet&quot;, the 1977 Concours featured a new vertical bar grille and a revised stand-up hood ornament. The rear of the Concours also got new triple unit taillamps reminiscent of the Caprice. It also boasted newly designed wheel covers and wider bright wheel-opening moldings. &quot;International in style, it is American in function,&quot; the sales brochure insisted of the Concours. The brochure went on to note that Concours offered a &quot;very special blending of classic style and good sense.&quot; That last comment referenced Nova&#x27;s sensible size. Novas themselves, the marketing materials said, were &quot;not too small, not too big, not too expensive.&quot;

For 1978 the Concours was discontinued to clear the way for the newly downsized Malibu, and the Nova Custom inherited much of the Concours&#x27; exterior finery but lacked the stand-up hood ornament displayed by the Concours. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl or Edinburgh woven sport cloth/vinyl. More basic versions of the 1978 Chevrolet Nova had the same grille as used in 1976-1977 and added a gold-tinted Chevy bowtie emblem at the leading edge of the hood. For &#x27;78 Nova was also available with Rally equipment, which included yet another front-end layout: a diamond-pattern grille with horizontal parking lights and black headlight bezels (basically the 1976-1977 SS grille), plus triple band striping and color-keyed Rally wheels. All Nova drivers faced a new dual-spoke, soft vinyl-covered steering wheel; the same one found in the Caprice and Malibu.

Any 1978 Chevrolet Nova could be ordered with a 250-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine, a 145-horsepower 305-cubic-inch V-8, or a 170-horsepower 350-cubic-inch V-8. Law enforcement agencies in 48 states were driving Novas by now, as the sales brochure boasted. Production dropped almost 100,000 for the model, to 288,000, making Nova the only Chevrolet series to show a sales decline for 1978. Sales of the Nova hatchback body style lagged well behind regular coupes and sedans, and base models handily outsold Customs.

Upon introduction of the downsized GM A-body (later G-body) mid-size cars in 1978, the X-body and downsized A-platform had similar exterior dimensions. The roomier and more modern downsized A-bodies outsold their X-body counterparts.

The 1979 Chevrolet Nova marked the end of the line for the rear-wheel-drive Nova. The front end was revised with rectangular headlights and a new grille for the short run (matching that of its Pontiac Phoenix cousin, which replaced the Ventura for 1977); a modified horizontal-bar grille contained vertical parking lights. New chromed hood and fender moldings were installed, and new front-bumper filler panels gave the front end a more finished look. The Custom went back to the base dual section taillights since the triple section taillights were discontinued. The lineup was the same as in 1978; the base-level hatchback, coupe, and sedan, plus the Custom coupe and sedan. As usual, base coupe and sedan proved to be the best sellers. Nova Customs had a special acoustical package including improved headlining and full hood insulation, along with other luxury extras, while the Rally Package returned, this time using the same grille as other 1979 Novas. These final Novas were promoted for their &quot;solid value&quot; and &quot;reputation for dependability,&quot; capitalizing upon a 17-year heritage that had begun with the Chevy II. Fewer than 98,000 examples were produced. Regular production ended on December 22, 1978, but some cars badged &quot;Nova Custom&quot; were built on special order with luxury amenities in early 1979. The final Chevrolet Nova (Custom) built on special order would roll off the line on March 15, 1979, and this would be the end of the rear-drive Nova for good. Chevrolet&#x27;s compact models were headed into the front-wheel-drive age and for 1980, Nova&#x27;s place in the lineup would be taken over by the new and very different Chevrolet Citation (the Phoenix, Omega and Skylark carried over to this platform as well, and the Seville was reassigned to another front-drive platform).


== Fifth generation (1985–1988) ==
The Chevrolet Nova nameplate returned in spring 1984 as a front-wheel drive subcompact vehicle for the 1985 to 1988 model years. It was assembled in Fremont, California, by NUMMI, a joint venture between General Motors and Toyota of Japan, resulting in various Corolla-based cars sold under General Motors brands, also referred to as the S-car within GM. It resurrected a name last used on the compact-sized rear-wheel drive 1979 Chevrolet Nova. The new Nova was a rebadged and mildly restyled Japanese market Toyota Sprinter, a model sold in Japan as a badge engineered version of the Toyota Corolla. Nova shared the Corolla&#x27;s AE82 platform, 4-cylinder engines and was available with 5-speed manual, 3-speed or 4-speed automatic transmissions. For the first time ever, quad headlights were used on the Nova (mimicking most other models at the time, such as the slightly-larger Chevrolet Cavalier). It was designed for manufacturability and reached an unusually high level of quality and production speed at NUMMI, compared to other US factories.

=== 1985 model year ===
The 1985 Chevrolet Nova was initially offered only in a four-door three-box, notchback sedan body style and in the Midwestern states. A five-door hatchback was added shortly after its introduction, and the line was distributed throughout the US and Canada beginning around traditional new-model introduction time in the fall (as were the other Chevy imports, the Suzuki-based Sprint which had been first launched on the West Coast and the Isuzu-based Spectrum which had initially been available on the Eastern Seaboard and throughout New England and New York State). The only engine was a carbureted 1.6-liter four-cylinder with . It teamed with either a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. This was the same powertrain as offered in the Corolla. The four-door sedan listed for $7,435, a rather stiff tariff by Chevrolet standards. The five-door, which added a split-folding rear seat, started at $7,669. All Nova options were grouped into seven packages, which did away with the long list of optional equipment that accompanied such cars as the Chevrolet Chevette. (Simple though it was, the subcompact Chevette offered nearly 30 options). However, adding one of the costlier packages could easily push the Nova&#x27;s sticker to over $10,000.

=== 1987 model year ===
The 1987 Chevrolet Nova saw only minor changes after its introduction two years earlier as a near-twin to the front-wheel-drive Toyota Corolla. A rear-window defogger was added to the list of standard equipment, while visual changes were limited to lighter silver highlights on the vertical grille bars and a change of turn signal lens colors from amber to clear/white front and red rear. CL models also got red reflective panels carrying the taillights onto the trunk/hatch, body-colored bumpers, and new aluminum wheels. The 1987 Chevrolet Nova continued in two body styles, a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback. The four-door proved by far the more popular – by about three to one. Nova&#x27;s only engine was again a 74-horsepower 1.6-liter four designed by Toyota, mated to either a five-speed manual transmission or four-speed automatic. Though Corollas were priced slightly below competing Novas, Chevy&#x27;s version of the car could often be bought for less because slow sales encouraged dealers to discount prices. &quot;Slow sales,&quot; however, meant slow by Chevy standards, for the Nova sold about as well as the Corolla, and buyers would find that their discounted Nova in turn had a lower resale value than the equivalent Toyota, a pattern that would persist for GM-branded NUMMI cars. Aside from some minor interior and exterior trim differences, the cars were much the same, though Novas had a slightly softer suspension that favored ride over handling.
=== 1988 model year ===
The 1988 Chevrolet Nova added a sporty model to its lineup of subcompact front-wheel-drive cars. This new 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam got its name from a double-overhead-cam version of the Toyota-built 1.6-liter four-cylinder. Novas continued to share their basic design with the Corolla, and this engine had previously been used in the Toyota FX-16, a performance version of the Corolla. The twin-cam produced , 36 more than its single-cam sibling. A five-speed manual transmission was standard, as in the regular Novas, but the Twin-Cam offered a four-speed automatic as an option versus the three-speed offered on other models. The more potent engine elevated the 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cam into junior sport-sedan terri­tory, but the advancement didn&#x27;t come cheaply. The base Nova listed at about $8,800, the Twin-Cam went for $11,395. That price included fuel injection, sport suspension, power steering, leather-covered steering wheel, tachometer, four-wheel disc brakes, and wider tires on aluminum wheels, but it was a stiff tariff, and few were ordered (approximately 3,300 Twin-Cam models were built). There were no color choices; all 1988 Chevrolet Nova Twin-Cams wore black metallic paint with a grey interior; and there was no hatchback version offered. Every 1988 Chevrolet Nova got rear shoulder belts, rear window defogger, and AM/FM stereo radio as standard equipment. This was the last model year for the Nova name at Chevrolet. Starting with 1989, Chevrolet pushed this car into its new Geo division and renamed it the Prizm. Geo was Chevy&#x27;s effort to come up with an import-sounding label to attract buyers who were not inclined to shop American.

== Reviews ==
The reaction to the 1962 Chevrolet Chevy II was mainly positive. Veteran &quot;Mechanics Illustrated&quot; tester Tom McCahill was favorably impressed with a Chevy II 400 Series Nova convertible he drove at a press preview for Chevy&#x27;s 1962 models, held at GM&#x27;s Milford, Michigan, test track. &quot;Flat out, which with Powerglide was 91 mph, this little car never wavered and even over some rough strips it was one of the safest feeling 91&#x27;s I have ever driven.&quot; The styling reminded &quot;Uncle&quot; Tom of a &quot;small Mercedes-Benz&quot;, and he concluded that &quot;with a little hopping up, a stick shift and its low price, it should sell like cold beer on a hot Fourth of July.&quot;

&quot;Car Life&quot; was even more enthusiastic, honoring the Chevy II with its &quot;Award for Engineering Excellence&quot;. &quot;We think the Chevy II, in either 4- or 6-cylinder form, represents an important development in the American automotive field,&quot; reported the magazine. &quot;We think it represents a return to sensibility in terms of basic transportation; it is a car of reasonable size, adequate performance and simple elegance.&quot; The award was mentioned in a 1962 Chevrolet Nova advertisement. (see right)

&quot;Consumer Reports&quot; described the six-cylinder Chevy II as an &quot;ultra-sensible, conventional car with outstanding interior space,&quot; but also reported &quot;higher than average&quot; interior noise levels. There were also complaints about the four-cylinder version&#x27;s lack of refinement. &quot;CR hesitates to recommend the Four for normal use. The Four is an excellent hackabout for specialized local use – if you can stand the vibration.&quot; McCahill put it this w­ay: &quot;The four wasn&#x27;t the smoothest four I have ever driven, but it had nice response and will probably still be running long after Castro shaves his beard off.&quot; &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; in 1963: &quot;New last year, the Chevy II has not yet developed into a smooth-riding, quiet, or in any sense luxurious car. It is an easy driving, agile one. By far its most important asset is a body with substantially the room of intermediate cars, but with a very compact silhouette and especially good entrance height.&quot;

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; called the new Chevy II &quot;a most straightforward car – simple, honest and conventional.&quot; Editor Jerry Titus was fascinated with the new rear single-leaf suspension: &quot;How it actually works seems almost contradictory. There is a great deal of body roll, but the car does not feel unstable. The ride is soft and pleasing, but not seasick-soft with the constant pitching and rolling that some cars have.&quot; Interior room, steering, and brakes were commended. Performance was rated as &quot;moderate&quot; for a six-cylinder Nova convertible with Powerglide: 0-60 came up &quot;a shade under 16 seconds,&quot; and the top speed was reported to be 98 mph, but Titus felt that &quot;the car seems at its best below 75, where it did not feel as though it was working hard.&quot; The four, meanwhile, took 20 seconds to make it from 0 to 60 mph. In comparison, a 1960 90 bhp Falcon with stick shift took 21 seconds 0 to 60, also according to Motor Trend, while the 101 bhp six introduced for 1961 required 14.3 seconds with stick and 15.2 with the two-speed Fordomatic.

&quot;Motor Trend&quot; tested a 1964 195-bhp, two-barrel SS with Powerglide, recording 0 to 60 in 11.3 seconds, 18.0 seconds and 75 mph in the quarter-mile, and 100 mph all out. Fuel economy ranged from 12.3 mpg in heavy traffic to 19.6 on the highway. &quot;Motor Trend&quot; concluded that &quot;By adding a V-8 and bigger brakes, plus detail changes, Chevrolet has made a nice compact even more desirable and a much better performer.&quot;

The mid-1980s Nova made no attempt to recapture the former &quot;Muscle&quot; glory that it once had, with the Twin Cam performance variant appearing only in the final year of the nameplate after Toyota had already moved on to the next generation of the platform.

== International Novas ==

=== Canada ===

While the Chevy II and Nova were also sold in Canada, from the beginning a mildly re-trimmed version was also sold by Pontiac-Buick dealers as the Acadian.

The Acadian was produced between the years 1962 and 1971. It was a stand-alone make based upon the Chevy II, which was produced in both the U.S. and Canada and sold exclusively through Canadian Pontiac – Buick – GMC dealerships. Due to the Canadian tariffs on imports put into place many years before, there was no compact car available to the Canadian Pontiac dealer. The U.S. built Pontiac Tempest, which started production in 1961 was not available initially to the Canadian buyer – import duties would have made it too expensive to compete in the thrifty Canadian compact market. The Acadian was introduced to give the unhappy Canadian Pontiac – Buick dealer a car he could sell in the growing compact market. During its entire run, the Acadian offered the same body styles as were offered in the Chevy II/Nova, and the cars were virtually the same, save minor trim and badging details.

Originally offered in top-line Beaumont and base Invader trim, the top trim line was renamed Canso in anticipation of the Chevelle-based Acadian Beaumont which would arrive for 1964. A sporty model, the Sport Deluxe (or &quot;SD&quot;), was equivalent to the U.S.-market Nova SS, and it also featured bucket seats, deluxe exterior trim, and special badging.

Base price for the 1966 Acadian was $2,507. The 327-350 hp (L79) was available; 85 were produced. The Acadian line was now down to six models; 7,366 Acadians were sold in 1966. It survived until mid-1971, after which it was replaced by the Pontiac Ventura II.

=== Argentina ===
In 1962 Argentina offered the 1962–1964 Chevy II as the Chevrolet 400 through 1974, and the 1968–1972 Nova as the Chevrolet Chevy from late 1969 through 1978, both models overlapping for several years. An upscale model (Chevy Super) was produced from about 1973 with different trim, front turn indicators and taillights, a much better appointed interior with plastic &quot;wood&quot; trim, named Malibu with no relation to the American Chevelle. All engines were inline-sixes. The first and second generations were available, depending on year and model, with the , and engines.

The third generation (&quot;Chevys&quot;) were produced with the and engines with specially tuned carburetors for sporting models. The &quot;Chevy&quot; metal emblem for the third generation had the same font as the &quot;Nova&quot; emblem of 1968–1974 American Novas, and was, for the first few years, in the rearmost section of both rear fenders. Later, it was moved to the rearmost section of both front fenders, as it was in the American cars from 1969. Sidemarker lights were not mandatory and changed much during the production run, from being deleted, to leaving a small chrome plate, to the same light as in the American cars. Rear deck emblems just said &quot;&quot; in chrome letters, obviating the typical &quot;Model by Chevrolet&quot; used in the American cars at the time. The hood emblem was similar to the 1969 American Novas: the bow tie, either in blue or just chrome.

Initially, the Argentinian Chevy used very similar trim to the American counterpart, while more luxurious – a &quot;big&quot; car by local standards. They there standard models without accessories and were often used for taxi service. The interior layout remained the American 1968 version for the entire run. The ignition switch remained dash mounted as the U.S.-mandated steering lock was not required in Argentina. Power steering became available at the end of the production run. V8s versions weren&#x27;t produced: Power windows were not available, tinted windows were darker than American versions, and the darker band on the upper edge of the windshield was not present.

Popular accessories were vinyl roofs, rally wheels, sport steering wheels, bucket seats with high backs, and tufted leatherette upholstery (many sedans were produced this way). Interiors were usually black. Steering wheels and instrument panels were only black for many years, as were seatbelts. American style interior color coordination was absent. The last year of the Nova in Argentina is called locally &quot;Opus 78&quot; (because the slogan of the publicity) and it was the most well-equipped, adding simil-leather bucket seats, air conditioning, power steering, electric antenna, and a new dashboard with integrated central console. During its run on certain models, the &quot;Chevy&quot; was also available with the 3-speed Turbo Hydra-Matic automatic transmission as an option. It was marketed with the name &quot;Chevromatic.&quot;

Their Super Sport (&quot;SS&quot;) counterparts were both coupés and 4-door sedans. A majority were fitted with inline-sixes with a single two-barrel Holey 2300 RX 7214-A carburetor giving out , coupled to a four-speed ZF manual transmission. Corsa, a local auto publication magazine, tested a Chevy Coupé SS Serie 2 and obtained a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 11.1 seconds.

== Urban legend ==
A popular but false urban legend claims that the vehicle sold poorly in Spanish-speaking countries because &quot;no va&quot; translates to &quot;doesn&#x27;t go&quot;. However, in Spanish &#x27;&#x27; is a distinct word primarily used to refer to the astronomical event, and doesn&#x27;t have the same meaning as &#x27;no va&#x27;. In fact, the car actually sold quite well in Mexico, as well as many Central and South American countries. Nova was also the name of a successful brand of gasoline sold in Mexico at the time, further proving that the name confusion was not a problem.

A similar story has been told of the British Vauxhall Nova (a small car that was completely unrelated to the Chevrolet Nova aside from both being built by GM). According to the story, it had to be sold as an Opel Corsa in Spain due to the same alleged language confusion. This version of the story is also a myth, as the Spanish-market version of the car was known as a Corsa from the outset. In fact, the car was called the Corsa in all markets except the United Kingdom.

There was also a Nova kit car designed and built by A.D.D. from 1971. It lost a court case with GM Vauxhall over the use of the name, after it was shown that GM&#x27;s Chevrolet had a prior claim.

<text>Grenville County is a former county in the Canadian province of Ontario. It fronted on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, between the towns of Kingston and Cornwall. The county was created in 1792, and named in honour of William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville, who was the British Secretary of State responsible for the colonies in 1790. It consisted of five townships, which were settled primarily by United Empire Loyalists in the late 1700s after the Revolutionary War. Prior to being settled by Europeans, the area was home to many generations of native cultures. Grenville County merged with Leeds County in 1850 to create Leeds and Grenville County. The county covered an area of .

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, numerous Native American villages were present in Grenville County; when the settlers first arrived, these natives still occupied the area and were essentially forced out by the settlements. The French briefly occupied this area at present-day Johnstown, in what was to become Edwardsburgh township, and at Pointe au Baril (present day Maitland) in what would be Augusta township. These French settlements date back to 1670 and 1759 respectively.

In the late 1700s while the region was part of the British Lununberg District in the Province of Quebec, land was surveyed in and around what would later become Grenville County to be distributed as land grants to the United Empire Loyalists and their families for their loyalty to the Crown. The emphasis of the Crown government was on military defense, economic growth and political stability. The strategy was to increase the population, maintain efficient military districts, and develop political counties and townships to be dotted with agricultural hamlets and towns and commercially-oriented cities. There was not emphasis on industrial development because of lack of basic infrastructure in the region. The first townships laid out were called the Royal Townships. Situated along the St. Lawrence River where land was most productive and travel was convenient, two of these townships were to become part of Grenville County – Edwardsburgh, Royal Township Six, and Augusta, Royal Township Seven. In 1791 the Province of Upper Canada was created from part of the Province of Quebec. The Upper Canada partition of Lunenberg District was renamed Eastern District in 1792; Grenville County was one of the counties created in 1792. Shortly after the Loyalist refugee arrivals, Irish and Scottish immigrants began to settle in the area as well.

The European settlers dotted the new townships with small agricultural communities which were mostly self-sustaining. These communities were established out of necessity, as roads in the area were not well-established during nineteenth century and people were travelling on foot or via horse and buggy. Every few kilometres, a village or hamlet was usually present; these villages usually each had their own churches, schools, cemeteries and temperance halls, as well as pioneer businesses such as cheese factories, saw and grist mills, blacksmiths, limekilns, post offices, general stores or asheries. Most residents made their living through small-scale mixed farming operations. But there was an ennui; the Durham Report led to merging the Colony of Upper Canada on 10 February 1841 as Canada West into the (United) Province of Canada, thus assuring lower cost funding for long term improvements in Canada West and more dynamic prospects in British North America. 

One reason counties existed was so inhabitants could conduct legal transactions efficiently, as each county was the seat of a county court. As transportation improved within some counties, their political consolidation with neighboring counties could occur leading to better integration and centralization efficiencies. On 1 January 1850, Grenville county was amalgamated with the neighbouring county of Leeds, to become the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville, while Johnstown District was abolished. Prior to confederation, the area of Upper Canada was divided by districts, which held the counties, which held the townships; districts changed often in name and in area making records from this era appear confusing. During the mid-1800s within Canada West, counties began amalgamating as transportation improved and the districts were dropped as counties increased in population. At the founding of the Dominion of Canada on 1 July 1867, Grenville County, amalgamated with Leeds, became part of Ontario, with Ontario now being divided neatly by counties.

==Territorial evolution==
The original county was constituted in 1792, and was an electoral district for the new Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada:

In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada withdrew parts of Grenville and Leeds to form Carleton County and the three counties together were constituted as Johnstown District, effective at the beginning of 1800. Grenville consisted of the following townships:

In 1838, the townships of Marlborough and North Gower were transferred to Carleton County, and the township of Montague was transferred to Lanark County.

When the Johnstown District was abolished in 1850, Grenville County was united with Leeds County to form the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville.

==Original townships==
The five remaining townships at 1838 were Augusta, Edwardsburgh, Oxford-on-Rideau, South Gower, and Wolford.

*Augusta township (still exists), covers an area of . It was first surveyed in 1783, and was named in honour of Princess Augusta Sophia, second daughter and sixth child of George III. This township is located along the southern border of Leeds and Grenville along the St. Lawrence River.
*Edwardsburgh township (now Edwardsburgh/Cardinal), covers an area of . The township was first surveyed in 1783, and was named in honour of Prince Edward, fourth son and fifth child of George III. This township is located along the southern border of Leeds and Grenville along the St. Lawrence River, east of Augusta township.
*Oxford-on-Rideau township (Now part of North Grenville), covered an area of and was first surveyed in 1791. The township was later amalgamated in the 1990s with South Gower township and the town of Kemptville to become North Grenville. This township was located north of both Edwardsburgh and Augusta townships, between Wolford and South Gower.
*South Gower township (Now part of North Grenville), covered an area of and was first surveyed in 1799. This township was located north of Edwardsburgh.
*Wolford township (now the village-status municipality of Merrickville-Wolford) covered an area of and was first surveyed in 1795. It was named for the Devonshire seat of John Graves Simcoe. This township was located west of Oxford-on-Rideau, and north of Augusta. In the 1990s, Wolford township became known as its own municipality, and was renamed Merrickville–Wolford.

<text>Leeds County is a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario. The county was first surveyed in 1792 as one of the nineteen counties created by Sir John Graves Simcoe in preparation for the United Empire Loyalists to settle here. The county took its name from Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds; the &quot;Leeds&quot; of the Dukedom referred to Leeds in West Yorkshire, England and not for Leeds, Kent, England. In 1850, Leeds County merged with Grenville County to create the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville. This county was home to several townships as well as the city of Brockville.

==History==
The original county was constituted in 1792, and was united with Frontenac County as an electoral district for the new Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada:

In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada withdrew parts of Leeds and Grenville to form Carleton County and the three counties together were constituted as Johnstown District, effective at the beginning of 1800. Leeds consisted of the following townships:

In 1838, the parts of the townships of Burgess and Elmsley north of the Rideau Canal were withdrawn from Leeds and transferred to Lanark County.

When the Johnstown District was abolished in 1850, Leeds County was united with Grenville County to form the United Counties of Leeds and Grenville.

===Municipal restructuring===
* 1998:
** The townships of Bastard, North Crosby, South Burgess, South Crosby and South Elmsley amalgamated to become Rideau Lakes Township.
** The townships of Lansdowne, Leeds, and most of Escott (the southern portion) amalgamated to become Leeds and the Thousand Islands Township.
* 2001:
** The townships of Elizabethtown and Kitley amalgamated to become Elizabethtown-Kitley Township.
** The northern portions of Escott and Yonge Townships amalgamated to become Athens Township.
** The southern portion of Yonge Township became Front of Yonge Township.

<doc id="1092350" wikidata="Q145810" url="?curid=1092350" title="Kizlyar">
<text>Kizlyar (; ; , &quot;Qızlar&quot;) is a town in the Republic of Dagestan, Russia, located on the border with the Chechen Republic in the delta of the Terek River northwest of Makhachkala, the capital of the republic. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 48,984.

== Etymology ==
According to some researchers, the name of the city comes from an old name for the Terek River. Another translation of the name Kizlyar is from an unspecified Turkic language, meaning &quot;girls&quot;. According to Vyacheslav Nikonov, correct translation of this Turkic toponym is &quot;red cliff&quot;.

==History==
The first documented reference to Kizlyar dates back to 1609, although some historians associate the place with Samandar, the 8th-century capital of Khazaria. In 1735 the Russian government built a fortress in Kizlyar and laid foundations for the Caucasus fortified borderline. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Kizlyar operated as one of the trading posts between Russia and the Middle East and Central Asia. During this period, the population was largely Armenian and Russian. In 1796 2,800 Armenians and 1,000 Russians lived in Kizlyar. During the Russian Empire, the settlement was the administrative capital of the Kizlyarsky Otdel of the Terek Oblast. In 1942 the Germans briefly took Kizylar (Kizjlar).

In January 1996 Chechen separatists raided the local airbase in the course of the Kizlyar raid, which claimed the lives of seventy-eight Russian soldiers.

On 18 February 2018 five people were killed and five wounded after a shooting attack took place outside a Christian church in Kizlyar. Police killed the attacker in a shootout.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kizlyar serves as the administrative center of Kizlyarsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with one urban-type settlement (Komsomolsky) and one rural locality (the railway crossing loop of No. 17), incorporated separately as the Town of Kizlyar—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the Town of Kizlyar is incorporated as Kizlyar Urban Okrug.

==Demographics==

As of the 2021 Census, the town&#x27;s ethnic composition was as follows:
*Russians (35.5%)
*Avars (24.5%)
*Dargins (15.5%)
*Kumyks (5.3%)
*Lezgins (4.6%)
*Laks (4.2%)
*Tabasarans (2.0%)
*Azerbaijanis (1.9%)
*Rutuls (1.5%)
*Nogais (1.2%)

==Economy==

In the early 19th century, Kizlyar became a center of viticulture and wine making. The local cognac factory (Kizlyar Brandy Factory) produces a variety of alcoholic beverages but specializes primarily in a regional variant of brandy, marketed throughout Russia as &quot;cognac&quot;. &quot;Kizlyarka&quot; is a type of grape vodka produced in Kizlyar. Kizlyar is also known for traditional knife, dagger, and saber making.

==Climate==
Kizlyar has a cold semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSk&quot;).
==Twin towns and sister cities==
Kizlyar has sister city relationships with:
*Baku, Azerbaijan
*Budyonnovsk, Stavropol Krai, Russia
*Azov, Rostov Oblast, Russia

==Notable people==
*Roman Bagration (1778–1834), general in the Imperial Russian Army
*Pyotr Bagration (1765-1812), general in the Imperial Russian Army
*Romanos Melikian (1883–1935), composer
*Rasul Mirzaev (born 1986), mixed martial artist
*Tagir Gadzhiev (born 1994), Russian international Rugby player.

<text>Stephen Tyng Mather (July 4, 1867 – January 22, 1930) was an American industrialist and conservationist who was the first director of the National Park Service. As president and owner of Thorkildsen-Mather Borax Company he became a millionaire. With his friend the journalist Robert Sterling Yard, Mather led a publicity campaign to promote the creation of a unified federal agency to oversee National Parks administration, which was established in 1916. In 1917, Mather was appointed to lead the NPS, the new agency created within the Department of the Interior. He served until 1929, during which time Mather created a professional civil service organization, increased the numbers of parks and national monuments, and established systematic criteria for adding new properties to the federal system.

==Early life==
Stephen Tyng Mather was born July 4, 1867, in San Francisco, and named for the prominent Episcopal minister Stephen Tyng of New York, who was admired by his parents, Joseph W. Mather and Bertha Jemima Walker. Mather was educated at Boys&#x27; High School (now Lowell High School) in San Francisco, and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1887.

His family moved to New York, where Mather worked as a reporter for the &quot;New York Sun&quot; until 1893. During that time he met and befriended Robert Sterling Yard, another reporter, who would become a close friend. In 1893 Mather married Jane Thacker Floy of Elizabeth, New Jersey, with Yard serving as his best man. They had one daughter, Bertha Floy Mather. In 1906, Mather became the sole owner of the Mather family homestead in Darien, Connecticut, which had been built by his great-grandfather about 1778. He and his family used it during the summers and he regarded it as his true home. It is now a historic site open to the public. 

==Business career==
Mather started working for the Pacific Coast Borax Company at its headquarters in New York, where his father was administrator. Borax is a component of a variety of detergents and compounds, which was mined almost exclusively in California. Borax is a commodity, and as such, one brand is essentially as good as another. For a company to be successful, it had to mine the product more cheaply, process it more efficiently, or market it more aggressively. In 1894 the younger Mather moved with his wife to Chicago, where he established a distribution center for the company. In this role, he proved vital in advertising and sales promotion for the company. In particular he is credited with the idea of adding the label &quot;20 Mule Team Borax&quot; to the company&#x27;s product, which subsequently became a household name throughout the country.

In 1898, Mather helped a friend, Thomas Thorkildsen, in starting another borax company. After suffering a severe episode of bipolar disorder in 1903 and having his salary withheld during extended sick leave, Mather resigned from Pacific Coast and joined Thorkildsen full-time in 1904. They named their firm the Thorkildsen-Mather Borax Company. Their company became prosperous, and they were millionaires by 1914. This gave Mather the financial independence to pursue personal projects, and while in his mid-forties, he retired from the company to pursue those. Mather was active in many civic groups, including the Chicago City Club and Municipal Voter&#x27;s League.

==Conservation==
Travel with his wife to Europe in 1904 renewed Mather&#x27;s longtime interest in nature. Seeing the parks of Europe and their public accessibility, Mather was inspired to work to preserve more parkland in the US, to encourage new transportation methods to reach them, and to protect scenic resources and natural areas for the public good. He became a dedicated conservationist, and a friend and admirer of the influential John Muir.

In 1904, Mather joined the Sierra Club, and climbed Mount Rainier with some of its members the following year. He was active in the group and made numerous allies who helped support the creation of the National Park Service. In 1916 the Sierra Club made him an honorary vice-president.

In 1915, Mather became a member of the Boone and Crockett Club, a conservation organization founded by Theodore Roosevelt and George Bird Grinnell in 1887.

There is the traditional story of how Mather came to Washington to run the National parks, which Horace Albright later said was wrong, though he had a part in keeping the story alive. Here&#x27;s the traditional, if incorrect, story:
In 1914, Mather observed the deteriorating conditions in several National Parks, and wrote a letter of protest to Washington. Soon he received a reply from Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane, a former classmate of Mather&#x27;s from the University of California. Lane responded, &quot;Dear Steve, If you don&#x27;t like the way the parks are being run, come on down to Washington and run them yourself.&quot;

But in later years, Mather&#x27;s assistant Horace Albright was to state:
In reality, they didn&#x27;t know each other. Mather had graduated from the University of California with a Bachelor of Letters degree in 1887. Although registered in the class of 1889, Lane never did graduate. Adolph Miller, who knew both men quite well, graduated in Mather&#x27;s class and affirmed that the two were not personally acquainted until 1914. 

Mather did go to Washington as assistant secretary of the Interior, and lobbied for the establishment of a bureau to operate the national parks. On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the bill authorizing the National Park Service. At the time, the government owned 14 parks and 19 national monuments, many administered by Army officers or political appointees, as battlefields were among the first parks designated. He used his personal funds to hire Robert Sterling Yard to work with him on publicizing the great resources of the parks. Mather was effective in building support for the parks with a variety of politicians and wealthy corporate leaders. He also led efforts to publicize the National Parks and develop wider appreciation for their scenic beauty among the population. He appointed Yard as head of the National Park Education Committee to coordinate their various communication efforts. In April 1917, Mather was appointed as its first director, a position he filled until he resigned due to illness in January, 1929. During the course of his career, he and his staff molded the NPS into one of the most respected and prestigious arms of the federal government. Special credit is owing Horace M. Albright, another Sierra Club member, who served as assistant to Mather, and acting director during Mr. Mather&#x27;s illnesses.

==National Park Service==
In 1916, the National Park Service was authorized by Congress and approved by President Wilson. Mather agreed to stay on, and with Albright, helped establish the new federal agency to protect and manage the national parks, together with a new appreciation for their wonders. In addition, he professionalized management of the parks, creating a cadre of career civil service people who were specialists in a variety of disciplines, to operate and manage the parks while preserving their natural character.

In 1917, Mather was appointed Assistant Secretary of Interior and head of the National Park Service. Due to his success in working with leaders of various groups and the Congress, he served until 1929. He believed that magnificent scenery should be the first criterion in establishing a national park, and made efforts to have new parks established before the lands were developed for other purposes.

He introduced concessions to the national parks. Among the services they sold were basic amenities and necessities to park visitors, plus aids for studying nature. Mather promoted the creation of the National Park to Park Highway. He also encouraged cooperation with the railroads to increase visitation to normally remote units of the National Park System. He believed that once more of the public had visited the parks and enjoyed a comfortable stay in concessionaire facilities then they would become supporters for the fledgling agency and its holdings. By the time he left his position, the park system included 20 national parks and 32 national monuments. Mather also had created the criteria for identifying and adopting new parks and monuments.

Periodically disabled by bipolar disorder (manic-depression), Mather had to take some leaves from work and Albright continued in their mutual understanding of the task. Over time they convinced Congress of the wisdom of extending the national park concept into the East, and in 1926 Shenandoah and Great Smoky Mountains national parks were authorized. In January 1929 Mather suffered a stroke and had to leave office. He died a year later.

<text>Cretoxyrhina (; meaning &#x27;Cretaceous sharp-nose&#x27;) is an extinct genus of large mackerel shark that lived about 107 to 73 million years ago during the late Albian to late Campanian of the Late Cretaceous. The type species, &quot;C. mantelli&quot;, is more commonly referred to as the Ginsu shark, first popularized in reference to the Ginsu knife, as its theoretical feeding mechanism is often compared with the &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; when one uses the knife. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; is traditionally classified as the likely sole member of the family Cretoxyrhinidae but other taxonomic placements have been proposed, such as within the Alopiidae and Lamnidae.
Measuring up to in length and weighing over , &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was one of the largest sharks of its time. Having a similar appearance and build to the modern great white shark, it was an apex predator in its ecosystem and preyed on a large variety of marine animals including mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, sharks and other large fish, pterosaurs, and occasionally dinosaurs. Its teeth, up to long, were razor-like and had thick enamel built for stabbing and slicing prey. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was also among the fastest-swimming sharks, with hydrodynamic calculations suggesting burst speeds of up to . It has been speculated that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; hunted by lunging at its prey at high speeds to inflict powerful blows, similar to the great white shark today, and relied on strong eyesight to do so.

Since the late 19th century, several fossils of exceptionally well-preserved skeletons of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; have been discovered in Kansas. Studies have successfully calculated its life history using vertebrae from some of the skeletons. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; grew rapidly during early ages and reached sexual maturity at around four to five years of age. Its lifespan has been calculated to extend to nearly forty years. Anatomical analysis of the &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; skeletons revealed that the shark possessed facial and optical features most similar to that in thresher sharks and crocodile sharks and had a hydrodynamic build that suggested the use of regional endothermy.

As an apex predator, &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; played a critical role in the marine ecosystems it inhabited. It was a cosmopolitan genus and its fossils have been found worldwide, although most frequently in the Western Interior Seaway area of North America. It preferred mainly subtropical to temperate pelagic environments but was known in waters as cold as . &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; saw its peak in size by the Coniacian, but subsequently experienced a continuous decline until its extinction during the Campanian. One factor in this demise may have been increasing pressure from competition with predators that arose around the same time, most notably the giant mosasaur &quot;Tylosaurus&quot;. Other possible factors include the gradual disappearance of the Western Interior Seaway.

==Taxonomy==
===Research history===

&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was first described by the English paleontologist Gideon Mantell from eight &quot;C. mantelli&quot; teeth he collected from the Southerham Grey Pit near Lewes, East Sussex. In his 1822 book&quot;The fossils of the South Downs&quot;, co-written with his partner Mary Ann Mantell, he identified them as teeth pertaining to two species of locally-known modern sharks. Mantell identified the smaller teeth as from the common smooth-hound and the larger teeth as from the smooth hammerhead, expressing some hesitation to the latter. In the third volume of his book &quot;Recherches sur les poissons fossiles&quot;, published in 1843, Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz reexamined Mantell&#x27;s eight teeth. Using them and another tooth from the collection of the Strasbourg Museum (whose exact location was unspecified but also came from England), he concluded that the fossils actually pertained to a single species of extinct shark that held strong dental similarities with the three species then classified in the now-invalid genus &quot;Oxyrhina&quot;, &quot;O. hastalis&quot;, &quot;O. xiphodon&quot;, and &quot;O. desorii&quot;. Agassiz placed the species in the genus &quot;Oxyrhina&quot; but noted that the much thicker root of its teeth made enough of a difference to be a distinct species and scientifically classified the shark under the taxon &quot;Oxyrhina mantellii&quot;  and named in honor of Mantell.

During the late 19th century, paleontologists described numerous species that are now synonymized as &quot;Cretoxyrhina mantelli&quot;. According to some, there may have been as much as almost 30 different synonyms of &quot;O. mantelli&quot; at the time. Most of these species were derived from teeth that represented variations of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; but deviated from the exact characteristics of the syntypes. For example, in 1870, French paleontologist Henri Sauvage identified teeth from Sarthe, France, that greatly resembled the &quot;O. mantelli&quot; syntypes from England. The teeth also included lateral cusplets (small enameled cusps that appear at the base of the tooth&#x27;s main crown), which are not present in the syntypes, which led him to describe the teeth under the species name &quot;Otodus oxyrinoides&quot; based on the lateral cusplets. In 1873, American paleontologist Joseph Leidy identified teeth from Kansas and Mississippi and described them under the species name &quot;Oxyrhina extenta&quot;. These teeth were broader and more robust than the &quot;O. mantelli&quot; syntypes from England.

This all changed with the discoveries of some exceptionally well-preserved skeletons of the shark in the Niobrara Formation in West Kansas. Charles H. Sternberg discovered the first skeleton in 1890, which he described in a 1907 paper:

Charles R. Eastman published his analysis of the skeleton in 1894. In the paper, he reconstructed the dentition based on the skeleton&#x27;s disarticulated tooth set. Using the reconstruction, Eastman identified the many extinct shark species and found that their fossils are actually different tooth types of &quot;O. mantelli&quot;, which he all moved into the species. This skeleton, which Sternberg had sold to the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, was destroyed in 1944 by allied bombing during World War II. In 1891, Sternberg&#x27;s son George F. Sternberg discovered a second &quot;O. mantelli&quot; skeleton now housed in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History as KUVP 247. This skeleton was reported to measure in length and consists of a partial vertebral column with skeletal remains of a &quot;Xiphactinus&quot; as stomach contents and partial jaws with about 150 teeth visible. This skeleton was considered to be one of the greatest scientific discoveries of that year due to the unexpected preservation of cartilage. George F. Sternberg would later discover more &quot;O. mantelli&quot; skeletons throughout his career. His most notable finds were FHSM VP-323 and FHSM VP-2187, found in 1950 and 1965 respectively. The former is a partial skeleton consisting of a well-preserved set of jaws, a pair of five gills, and some vertebra while the latter is a near-complete skeleton with an almost complete vertebral column and an exceptionally preserved skull holding much of the cranial elements, jaws, teeth, a set of scales, and fragments of pectoral girdles and fins in their natural positions. Both skeletons are currently housed in the Sternberg Museum of Natural History. In 1968, a collector named Tim Basgall discovered another notable skeleton that, similar to FHSM VP-2187, also consisted of a near-complete vertebral column and a partially preserved skull. This fossil is housed in the University of Kansas Museum of Natural History as KUVP 69102.

In 1958, Soviet paleontologist Leonid Glickman found that the dental design of &quot;O. mantelli&quot; reconstructed by Eastman made it distinct enough to warrant a new genus—&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;. He also identified a second species of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; based on some of the earlier &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; teeth, which he named &quot;Cretoxyrhina denticulata&quot;. Originally, Glickman designated &quot;C. mantelli&quot; as the type species, but he abruptly replaced the position with another taxon identified as &quot; &#x27;Isurus denticulatus&#x27; &quot; without explanation in a 1964 paper, a move now rejected as an invalid taxonomic amendment. This nevertheless led Russian paleontologist Viktor Zhelezko to erroneously invalidate the genus &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; in a 2000 paper by synonymizing &quot; &#x27;Isurus denticulatus&#x27; &quot; (and thus the genus &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; as a whole) with another taxon identified as &quot; &#x27;Pseudoisurus tomosus&quot;&#x27;. Zhelezko also described a new species congeneric with &quot;C. mantelli&quot; based on tooth material from Kazakhstan, which he identified as &quot;Pseudoisurus vraconensis&quot; accordingly to his taxonomic reassessment. A 2013 study led by Western Australian Museum curator and paleontologist Mikael Siverson corrected the taxonomic error, reinstating the genus &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; and moving &quot; &#x27;P&#x27;. vraconensis&quot; into it. In 2010, British and Canadian paleontologists Charlie Underwood and Stephen Cumbaa described &quot;Telodontaspis agassizensis&quot; from teeth found in Lake Agassiz in Manitoba that were previously identified as juvenile &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; teeth. This species was reaffirmed into the genus &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; by a 2013 study led by American paleontologist Michael Newbrey using additional fossil material of the same species found in Western Australia.

Between 1997 and 2008, paleontologist Kenshu Shimada published a series of papers where he analyzed the skeletons of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; including those found by the Sternbergs using modernized techniques to extensively research the possible biology of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;. Some of his works include the development of more accurate dental, morphological, physiological, and paleoecological reconstructions, ontogenetic studies, and morphological-variable based phylogenetic studies on &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;. Shimada&#x27;s research on &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; helped shed new light on the understandings of the shark and, through his new methods, other extinct animals.

===Etymology===
&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; is a portmanteau of the word &quot;creto&quot; (short for &quot;Cretaceous&quot;) prefixed to the genus &quot;Oxyrhina&quot;, which is derived from the Ancient Greek ὀξύς (oxús, &quot;sharp&quot;) and ῥίς (rhís, &quot;nose&quot;). When put together they mean &quot;Cretaceous sharp-nose&quot;, although &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; is believed to have had a rather blunt snout. The type species name &quot;mantelli&quot; translates to &quot;from Mantell&quot;, which Louis Agassiz named in honor of English paleontologist Gideon Mantell for supplying him the syntypes of the species. The species name &quot;denticulata&quot; is derived from the Latin word &quot;denticulus&quot; (small tooth) and suffix &quot;āta&quot; (possession of), together meaning &quot;having small teeth&quot;. This is a reference to the appearance of lateral cusplets in most of the teeth in &quot;C. denticulata&quot;. The species &quot;vraconensis&quot; derived from the word &quot;vracon&quot; and the Latin &quot;ensis&quot; (from), meaning &quot;from Vracon&quot;, which is a reference to the Vraconian substage of the Albian stage in which the species was discovered. The species name &quot;agassizensis&quot; is derived from the name &quot;Agassiz&quot; and the Latin &quot;ensis&quot; (from), meaning &quot;from Agassiz&quot;, named after Lake Agassiz where the species was discovered. Coincidentally, the lake itself is named in honor of Louis Agassiz. The common name Ginsu shark, originally coined in 1999 by paleontologists Mike Everhart and Kenshu Shimada, is a reference to the Ginsu knife, as the theoretical feeding mechanisms of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; was often compared with the &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; when one uses the knife.

===Phylogeny and evolution===

&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; bore a resemblance to the modern great white shark in size, shape and ecology, but the two sharks are not closely related, and their similarities are a result of convergent evolution. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; has been traditionally grouped within the Cretoxyrhinidae, a family of lamnoid sharks that traditionally included other genera resulting in a paraphyletic or polyphyletic family. Siverson (1999) remarked that Cretoxyrhinidae was used as a &#x27;wastebasket taxon&#x27; for Cretaceous and Paleogene sharks and declared that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was the only valid member of the family.

&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; contains four valid species: &quot;C. vraconensis&quot;, &quot;C. denticulata&quot;, &quot;C. agassizensis&quot;, and &quot;C. mantelli&quot;. These species represent a chronospecies. The earliest fossils of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; are dated about 107 million years old and belong to &quot;C. vraconensis&quot;. The genus would progress by &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; evolving into &quot;C. denticulata&quot; during the Early Cenomanian which evolved into &quot;C. agassizensis&quot; during the Mid-Cenomanian which in turn evolved into &quot;C. mantelli&quot; during the Late-Cenomanian. It is notable that &quot;C. agassizensis&quot; continued until the Mid-Turonian and was briefly contemporaneous with &quot;C. mantelli&quot;. This progression was characterized by the reduction of lateral cusplets and the increasing size and robustness of teeth. The Late-Albian–Mid-Turonian interval sees mainly the reduction of lateral cusplets; &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; possessed lateral cusplets in all teeth except for a few in the anterior position, which would gradually become restricted only to the back lateroposteriors in adults by the end of the interval in &quot;C. mantelli&quot;. The Late Cenomanian–Coniacian interval was characterized by a rapid increase in tooth (and body) size, significant decrease of crown/height-crown/width ratio, and a transition from a tearing-type to a cutting-type tooth form. Tooth size of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; individuals inside the Western Interior Seaway peaked around 86 Ma during the latest Coniacian and then begins to slowly decline. In Europe, this peak takes place earlier during the Late Turonian. The youngest fossil of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; was found in the Bearpaw Formation of Alberta, dating as 73.2 million years old. A single tooth identified as &quot;Cretoxyrhina sp.&quot; was recovered from the nearby Horseshoe Canyon Formation and dated as 70.44 million years old, suggesting that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may have survived into the Maastrichtian. However, the Horseshoe Canyon Formation has only brackish water deposits despite &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; being a marine shark, making a likely possibility that the fossil was reworked from an older layer.

Phylogenetic studies through morphological data conducted by Shimada in 2005 suggested that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may alternatively be congeneric with the genus of the modern thresher sharks; the study also stated that the results are premature and may be inaccurate and recommended that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; is kept within the family Cretoxyrhinidae, mainly citing the lack of substantial data for it during the analysis.

Another possible model for &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; evolution, proposed in 2014 by paleontologist Cajus Diedrich, suggests that &quot;C. mantelli&quot; was congeneric with the mako sharks of the genus &quot;Isurus&quot; and was part of an extended &quot;Isurus&quot; lineage beginning as far the Aptian stage in the Early Cretaceous. According to this model, the &quot;Isurus&quot; lineage was initiated by &quot; &#x27;Isurus appendiculatus&#x27; &quot; (&quot;Cretolamna appendiculata&quot;), which evolved into &quot;Isurus denticulatus&quot; (&quot;Cretoxyrhina mantelli&quot; ) in the Mid-Cenomanian, then &quot; &#x27;Isurus mantelli&#x27; &quot; (&quot;Cretoxyrhina mantelli&quot; ) at the beginning of the Coniacian, then &quot;Isurus schoutedenti&quot; during the Paleocene, then &quot;Isurus praecursor&quot;, where the rest of the &quot;Isurus&quot; lineage continues. The study claimed that the absence of corresponding fossils during the Maastrichtian (72–66 Ma) was not a result of a premature extinction of &quot;C. mantelli&quot;, but merely a gap in the fossil record. Shimada and fellow paleontologist Phillip Sternes published a poster in 2018 which voiced doubt over the credibility of this proposal, noting that the study&#x27;s interpretation is largely based on data that had been arbitrarily selected and failed to cite either Shimada (1997) or Shimada (2005), which are key papers regarding the systematic position of &quot;C. mantelli&quot;.

===Morphology===
====Dentition====

Distinguishing characteristics of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; teeth include a nearly symmetrical or slanted triangular shape, razor-like and non-serrated cutting edges, visible tooth necks (bourlette), and a thick enamel coating. The dentition of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; possesses the basic dental characteristics of a mackerel shark, with tooth rows closely spaced without any overlap. Anterior teeth are straight and near-symmetrical, while lateroposterior teeth are slanted. The side of the tooth facing the mouth is convex and possesses massive protuberance and nutrient grooves on the root, whereas the labial side, which faces outwards, is flat or slightly swollen. Juveniles possessed lateral cusplets in all teeth, and &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; consistently retained them in adulthood. Lateral cusplets were retained only up to all lateroposterior teeth in adulthood in &quot;C. denticulata&quot; and &quot;C. agassizensis&quot; and only up to the back lateroposterior teeth in &quot;C. mantelli&quot;. The lateral cusplets of &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; and &quot;C. denticulata&quot; are round, while in &quot;C. agassizensis&quot; are sharpened to a point. The anterior teeth of &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; measure in height, while the largest known tooth of &quot;C. denticulata&quot; measures . &quot;C. mantelli&quot; teeth are larger, measuring in average slant height. The largest tooth discovered from this species may have measured up to .

The dentition of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; is among the best-known of all extinct sharks, thanks to fossil skeletons like FHSM VP-2187, which consists of a near-complete articulated dentition. Other &quot;C. mantelli&quot; skeletons, such as KUVP-247 and KUVP-69102, also include partial jaws with some teeth in their natural positions, some of which were not present in more complete skeletons like FHSM VP-2187. Using these specimens, the dental formula was reconstructed by Shimada (1997) and revised by Shimada (2002), it was . This means that from front to back, &quot;C. mantelli&quot; had: four symphysials (small teeth located in the symphysis of a jaw), two anteriors, four intermediates, and eleven or more lateroposteriors for the upper jaw and possibly one symphysial, two anteriors, one intermediate, and fifteen or more lateroposteriors for the lower jaw. The structure of the tooth row shows a dental structure suited for a feeding behavior similar to modern mako sharks, having large spear-like anteriors to stab and anchor prey and curved lateroposteriors to cut it to bite-size pieces, a mechanism often informally described as &quot;slicing and dicing&quot; by paleontologists. In 2011, paleontologists Jim Bourdon and Mike Everhart reconstructed the dentition of multiple &quot;C. mantelli&quot; individuals based on their associated tooth sets. They discovered that two of these reconstructions show some notable differences in the size of the first intermediate (I1) tooth and lateral profiles, concluding that these differences could possibly represent sexual dimorphism or individual variations.
====Skull====

Analysis of skull and scale patterns suggests that &quot;C. mantelli&quot; had a conical head with a dorsally flat and wide skull. The rostrum does not extend much forward from the frontal margin of the braincase, suggesting that the snout was blunt. Similar to modern crocodile sharks and thresher sharks, &quot;C. mantelli&quot; had proportionally large eyes, with the orbit roughly taking up one-third of the entire skull length, giving it acute vision. As a predator, good eyesight was important when hunting the large prey &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; fed on. In contrast, the more smell-reliant contemporaneous anacoracid &quot;Squalicorax&quot;″s less advanced orbital but stronger olfactory processes was more suitable for an opportunistic scavenger.

The jaws of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; were kinetically powerful. They have a slightly looser anterior curvature and a more robust build than that of the modern mako sharks, but otherwise were similar in general shape. The hyomandibula is elongated and was believed to swing laterally, which would allow jaw protrusion and deep biting.
====Skeletal anatomy====

Most species of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; are represented only by fossil teeth and vertebra. Like all sharks, the skeleton of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was made of cartilage, which is less capable of fossilization than bone. However, fossils of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; from the Niobrara Formation have been found exceptionally preserved; this was due to the formation&#x27;s chalk having high contents of calcium, allowing calcification to become more prevalent. When calcified, soft tissue hardens, making it more prone to fossilization.

Numerous skeletons consisting of near-complete vertebral columns have been found. The largest vertebra were measured up to in diameter. Two specimens with the best-preserved vertebral columns (FHSM VP-2187 and KUVP 69102) have 218 and 201 centra, respectively, and nearly all vertebra in the column preserved; only portions of the tail tip are missing for both. Estimations of tail length calculates a total vertebral count of approximately 230 centra, which is unique as all known extant mackerel sharks possess a vertebral count of either less than 197 or greater than 282 with none in between. The vertebral centra in the trunk region were large and circular, creating an overall spindle-shaped body with a stocky trunk.

An analysis of a partially complete tail fin fossil shows that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; had a lunate (crescent-shaped) tail most similar with modern lamnid sharks, whale sharks, and basking sharks. The transition to tail vertebrae is estimated to be between the 140th and 160th vertebrae out of the total 230, resulting in a total tail vertebral count of 70–90 and making up approximately 30–39% of the vertebral column. The transition from precaudal (the set of vertebrae before the tail vertebrae) to tail vertebrae is also marked by a vertebral bend of about 45°, which is the highest possible angle known in extant sharks and is mostly found in fast-swimming sharks, such as lamnids. These properties of the tail, along with other features such as smooth scales parallel to the body axis, a plesodic pectoral fin (a pectoral fin in which cartilage extends throughout, giving it a more secure structure that helps decrease drag), and a spindle-shaped stocky build, show that &quot;C. mantelli&quot; was capable of fast swimming.

===Physiology===
====Thermoregulation====

&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; represents one of the earliest forms and possible origins of endothermy in mackerel sharks. Possessing regional endothermy (also known as mesothermy), it may have possessed a build similar to modern regionally endothermic sharks like members of the thresher shark and lamnid families, where red muscles are closer to the body axis compared to ectothermic sharks (whose red muscles are closer to the body circumference), and a system of specialized blood vessels called &quot;rete mirabile&quot; (Latin for &quot;wonderful nets&quot;) is present, allowing metabolic heat to be conserved and exchanged to vital organs. This morphological build allows the shark to be partially warm-blooded, and thus efficiently function in the colder environments where &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; has been found. Fossils have been found in areas where paleoclimatic estimates show a surface temperature as low as . Regional endothermy in &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may have been developed in response to increasing pressure from progressive global cooling and competition from mosasaurs and other marine reptiles that had also developed endothermy.

====Hydrodynamics and locomotion====

&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; possessed highly dense overlapping placoid scales parallel to the body axis and patterned in parallel kneels separated by U-shaped grooves, each groove having a mean width of about 45 micrometers. This formation of scales allows efficient drag reduction and enhanced high-speed velocity capabilities, a morphotype seen only in the fastest known sharks. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; also had the most extreme case of a &quot;Type 4&quot; tail fin, having the highest known Cobb&#x27;s angle (curvature of tail vertebrae) and tail cartilage angle (49° and 133° respectively) ever recorded in mackerel sharks. A &quot;Type 4&quot; tail fin structure represents a build with maximum symmetry of the tail fin lobes, which is most efficient in fast swimming; among sharks, it is only found in lamnids.

A 2017 study by PhD student Humberto Ferron analyzed the relationships between the morphological variables including the skeleton and tail fin of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; and modeled an average cruising speed of and a burst swimming speed of around , making &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; possibly one of the fastest sharks known. For comparison, the modern great white shark has been modeled to reaches speeds of up to and the shortfin mako, the fastest extant shark, has been modeled at a speed of .

===Life history===
====Reproduction====
Although no fossil evidence for it has been found, it is inferred that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was ovoviviparous as all modern mackerel sharks are. In ovoviviparous sharks, young are hatched and grow inside the mother while competing against litter-mates through cannibalism such as oophagy (egg eating). As &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; inhabited oligotrophic and pelagic waters where predators such as large mosasaurs like &quot;Tylosaurus&quot; and macropredatory fish like &quot;Xiphactinus&quot; were common, it is likely that it also was an r-selected shark, where many infants are produced to offset high infant mortality rates. Similarly, pelagic sharks such as the great white shark, thresher sharks, mako sharks, porbeagle shark, and crocodile shark produce two to nine infants per litter.

====Growth and longevity====

Like all mackerel sharks, &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; grew a growth ring in its vertebrae every year and is aged through measuring each band; due to the rarity of well-preserved vertebrae, only a few &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; individuals have been aged. In Shimada (1997), a linear equation for calculating the total body length of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; using the centrum (the body of a vertebra) diameter of a vertebra was developed and is shown below, with representing total body length and representing centrum diameter (the diameter of each band).

Using this linear equation, measurements were first conducted on the best-preserved &quot;C. mantelli&quot; specimen, FHSM VP-2187, by Shimada (2008). The measurements showed a length of and weight of about at birth, and rapid growth in the first two years of life, doubling the length within 3.3 years. From then on, size growth became steady and gradual, growing a mean estimate of per year until its death at around 15 years of age, at which it had grown to . Using the von Bertalanffy growth model on FHSM VP-2187, the maximum lifespan of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; was estimated to be 38.2 years. By that age, it would have grown over long. Based on allometric scaling of a great white shark, Shimada found that such individual would have weighed as much as .

A remeasurement conducted by Newbrey &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) found that &quot;C. mantelli&quot; and &quot;C. agassizensis&quot; reached sexual maturity at around four to five years of age and proposed a possible revision to the measurements of the growth rings in FHSM VP-2187. The lifespan of FHSM VP-2187 and maximum lifespan of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; was also proposed to be revised to 18 and 21 years respectively using the new measurements. A 2019 study led by Italian scientist Jacopo Amalfitano briefly measured the vertebrae from two &quot;C. mantelli&quot; fossils and found that the older individual died at around 26 years of age. Measurements were also conducted on other &quot;C. mantelli&quot; skeletons and a vertebra of &quot;C. agassizensis&quot;, yielding results of similar rates of rapid growth in early stages of life. Such rapid growth within mere years could have helped &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; better survive by quickly phasing out of infancy and its vulnerabilities, as a fully grown adult would have few natural predators. The 2013 study also identified a syntype tooth of &quot;C. mantelli&quot; from England and calculated the individual&#x27;s maximum length of , making the tooth the largest known specimen yet. When applying the allometric scaling used in Shimada (2008), a &quot;C. mantelli&quot; of such length would yield an estimated body mass of around .

The graph below represents the length growth per year of FHSM VP-2187 according to Shimada (2008):
Other species were estimated to have been significantly smaller. &quot;C. denticulata&quot; and &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; reached a total body length of up to as an adult. Based on allometric scaling, individuals of such length would have weighed about . &quot;C. agassizensis&quot; was even smaller, with an estimated total body length of up to based on a tooth specimen (P2989.152) measuring tall.

==Paleobiology==
===Prey relationships===

The powerful kinetic jaws, high-speed capabilities, and large size of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; suggest a very aggressive predator. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;″s association with a diverse number of fossils showing signs of devourment confirms that it was an active apex predator that fed on much of the variety of marine megafauna in the Late Cretaceous. The highest trophic level it occupied was a position shared only with large mosasaurs such as &quot;Tylosaurus&quot; during the latter stages of the Late Cretaceous. It played a critical role in many marine ecosystems.
&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; mainly preyed on other active predators including ichthyodectids (a type of large fish that includes &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;), plesiosaurs, turtles, mosasaurs, and other sharks. Most fossils of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; feeding upon other animals consist of large and deep bite marks and punctures on bones, occasionally with teeth embedded in them. Isolated bones of mosasaurs and other marine reptiles that have been partially dissolved by digestion, or found in coprolites, are also examples of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; feeding. There are a few skeletons of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; containing stomach contents known, including a large &quot;C. mantelli&quot; skeleton (KUVP 247) which possesses skeletal remains of the large ichthyodectid &quot;Xiphactinus&quot; and a mosasaur in its stomach region. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may have occasionally fed on pterosaurs, evidenced by a set of cervical vertebrae of a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; from the Niobrara Formation with a &quot;C. mantelli&quot; tooth lodged deep between them. Although it cannot be certain if the fossil itself was a result of predation or scavenging, it was likely that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and similar pterosaurs were natural targets for predators like &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;, as they would routinely enter water to feed and thus be well within reach.

Although &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was mainly an active hunter, it was also an opportunistic feeder and may have scavenged from time to time. Many fossils with &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; feeding marks show no sign of healing, an indicator of a deliberate predatory attack on a live animal, leading to the possibility that at least some of the feeding marks were made from scavenging. Remains of partial skeletons of dinosaurs like &quot;Claosaurus&quot; and &quot;Niobrarasaurus&quot; show signs of feeding and digestion by &quot;C. mantelli&quot;. They were likely scavenged carcasses swept into the ocean due to the paleogeographical location of the fossils being that of an open ocean.

===Hunting strategies===

The hunting strategies of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; are not well documented because many fossils with &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; feeding marks cannot be distinguished between predation or scavenging. If they were indeed a result of the former, that would mean that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; most likely employed hunting strategies involving a main powerful and fatal blow similar to ram feeding seen in modern requiem sharks and lamnids. A 2004 study by shark experts Vittorio Gabriotti and Alessandro De Maddalena observed that the modern great white shark reaching lengths of greater than commonly ram its prey with massive velocity and strength to inflict single fatal blows, sometimes so powerful that prey would be propelled out of the water by the impact&#x27;s force. As &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; possessed a robust stocky build capable of fast swimming, powerful kinetic jaws like the great white shark, and reaches lengths similar to or greater than it, a hunting style like this would be likely.

==Paleoecology==
===Range and distribution===

&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; had a cosmopolitan distribution with fossils having been found worldwide. Notable locations include North America, Europe, Israel, and Kazakhstan. &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; mostly occurred in temperate and subtropical zones. It has been found in latitudes as far north as 55° N, where paleoclimatic estimates calculate an average sea surface temperature of . Fossils of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; are most well known in the Western Interior Seaway area, which is now the central United States and Canada. In 2013, Mikael Siverson and colleagues noted that during the Turonian or early Coniacian, &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; individuals living offshore were usually larger than those inhabiting the Western Interior Seaway, with some of the offshore &quot;C. mantelli&quot; fossils like one of the syntypes yielding total lengths of up to , possibly . Additionally, &quot;C. mantelli&quot; may have been migratory, as evidenced by its δ18Op values.

====Habitat====
&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; inhabited mainly temperate to subtropical pelagic oceans. A tooth of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta (a formation where the only water deposits found consist of brackish water and no oceans) suggests that it may have, on occasion, swum into partially fresh-water estuaries and similar bodies of water. However, a rework from an underlying layer may be a more likely explanation of such occurrence. The climate of marine ecosystems during the temporal range of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was generally much warmer than modern day due to higher atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases influenced by the shape of the continents at the time.

The interval during the Cenomanian and Turonian of 97–91 Ma saw a peak in sea surface temperatures averaging over and bottom water temperatures around , about warmer than modern day. Around this time, &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; coexisted with a radiating increase in diversity of fauna like mosasaurs. This interval also included a rise in global δ13C levels, which marks significant depletion of oxygen in the ocean, and caused the Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event. Although this event led to the extinction of as much as 27% of marine invertebrates, vertebrates like &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; were generally unaffected. The rest of the Cretaceous saw a progressive global cooling of Earth&#x27;s oceans, leading to the appearance of temperate ecosystems and possible glaciation by the Early Maastrichtian. Subtropical areas retained high biodiversity of all taxa, while temperate ecosystems generally had much lower diversity. In North America, subtropical provinces were dominated by sharks, turtles, and mosasaurs such as &quot;Tylosaurus&quot; and &quot;Clidastes&quot;, while temperate provinces were mainly dominated by plesiosaurs, hesperornithid seabirds, and the mosasaur &quot;Platecarpus&quot;.

===Competition===
&quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; lived alongside many predators that shared a similar trophic level in a diverse pelagic ecosystem during the Cretaceous. Most of these predators included large marine reptiles, some of which already occupied the highest trophic level when &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; first appeared. During the Albian to Turonian, about 107 to 91 Ma, &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; was contemporaneous and coexisted with Mid-Cretaceous pliosaurs. Some of these pliosaurs included &quot;Megacephalosaurus&quot;, which attained lengths of . By the Mid-Turonian, about 91 Ma, pliosaurs became extinct. It is thought that the radiation of sharks like &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may have been a major contributing factor to the acceleration of their extinction. The ecological void they left was quickly filled by emerging mosasaurs, which also came to occupy the highest trophic levels. Large mosasaurs like &quot;Tylosaurus&quot;, which reached in excess of in length, may have competed with &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;, and evidence of interspecific interactions such as bite marks from either have been found. There were also many sharks that
occupied a similar ecological role with &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; such as the cardabiodontids &quot;Cardabiodon&quot; and &quot;Dwardius&quot;, the latter showing evidence of direct competition with &quot;C. vraconensis&quot; based on intricate distribution patterns between the two.

A 2010 study by paleontologists Corinne Myers and Bruce Lieberman on competition in the Western Interior Seaway used quantitative analytical techniques based on Geographical information systems and tectonic reconstructions to reconstruct the hypothetical competitive relationships between ten of the most prevalent and abundant marine vertebrates of the region, including &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;. Their calculations found negative correlations between the distribution of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; and the three potential competitors &quot;Squalicorax kaupi&quot;, &quot;Tylosaurus proriger&quot;, and &quot;Platecarpus spp.&quot;; a statistically significant negative correlation implies that the distribution of one species was affected due to being outcompeted by another. However, none of the relationships were statistically significant, which instead indicates that the trends were unlikely the result of competition.

===Extinction===

The causes of the extinction of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; are uncertain. What is known is that it declined slowly over millions of years. Since its peak in size during the Coniacian, the size and distribution of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; fossils gradually declined until its eventual demise during the Campanian. Siverson and Lindgren (2005) noted that the age of the youngest fossils of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; differed between continents. In Australia, the youngest &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; fossils were dated approximately 83 Ma during the Santonian, while the youngest North American fossils known at the time (which were dated in the Early Campanian) were at least two million years older than the youngest fossils in Europe. The differences between ages suggests that &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may have become locally extinct in such areas over time until the genus as a whole went extinct.

It has been noted that the decline of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; coincides with the rise of newer predators such as &quot;Tylosaurus&quot;, suggesting that increasing pressure from competition with the mosasaur and other predators of similar trophic levels may have played a major contribution to &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot;″s decline and eventual extinction. Another possible factor was the gradual shallowing and shrinking of the Western Interior Seaway, which would have led to the disappearance of the pelagic environments preferred by the shark; this factor does not explain the decline and extinction of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; elsewhere. It has been suggested that the extinction of &quot;Cretoxyrhina&quot; may have helped the further increase the diversity of mosasaurs.

<text>A hydrocopter is an amphibious propeller-driven catamaran with a boat-like hull, small wheels and pontoon skis (as in a seaplane). An aircraft engine with a propeller and air rudder powers the vehicle over water, ice, snow and land.

Hydrocopters are used in Arctic coastal regions, primarily Sweden and Finland, during &quot;menföre&quot; (Swedish, &quot;bad going&quot;), or &quot;kelirikko&quot; (Finnish &quot;broken going&quot;) (see also Russian “rasputitsa&quot;), when melting ice cannot support ground vehicles and boats are hindered as well. Hydrocopters are often used as a low-cost alternative to hovercraft and helicopters. Hydrocopters are primarily produced in small machine shops or made by hobbyists as hydrocopters have never been mass produced.

== Design and manufacturing ==
Hydrocopters are generally smaller vehicles less than 20 ft long and weigh less than 2000 kg. Hydrocopters are powered by a fixed bladed aircraft propeller, the same as an airboat. Although they have the same propulsion as airboats, they are typically much slower. They typically travel under 12 knots whereas airboats are typically traveling over 40 knots. Hydrocopters use either skis or wheels on their pontoons to be able to travel on ice, snow or land in addition to traveling on water. This allows them to travel over terrain similar to a hovercraft.  

Hydrocopters use one system for lift and forward momentum while a hovercraft uses two systems, one for lift and another for forward momentum. Hovercraft have a constant down thrust which can be undesirable in certain conditions. Hydrocopters are also much cheaper than hovercraft.    

Hydrocopters have never been mass produced; they are made in small machine shops for individual customers. Consequently, they are easy to customize and there is a small but strong market for them. One of the first hydrocopters that was patented was called the Spider Craft. It is a small two-seater pontooned airboat and was patented in 1965. Since that time, hydrocopters have gone through multiple iterations. The current iteration is a modular design with steering and propulsion in the stern and the main cabin is in the first segment. This two-section design allows for faster turning and gives the occupants more space. Hydrocopters tend to use heavier fuel oil than airboats and airplanes. Additives are added to the fuel oil to avoid problems of freezing temperatures. Modern hydrocopters are primarily made from vacuum injected composites with a coating to prevent damage from moisture and cold temperatures. Hydrocopters used to be made much like airplanes or boats with an aluminum shell and a wooden interior. Lighter materials use less fuel and composites are more resistant to corrosion in the harsh environment. The pontoons in modern hydrocopters typically have more buoyancy to allow for heavier cargo loads.  

== Safety ==
Hydrocopters, like air boats, are top heavy. This can cause issues with capsizing (rolling over) or flipping. Hydrocopters usually have less points of contact on the water and a high center of gravity so risk of capsizing is increased, especially in rough seas. However, they are usually safer than air boats because they travel at much slower speeds. Consequently, hydrocopters don’t often get out of displacement mode, which means that most of the weight of the hydrocopter is supported by the water. Modern hydrocopters typically have two compartments. The rear compartment houses the engine and the front cabin houses the passengers. These two compartments provide the hydrocopter with much more stability when doing sharp turns.  

Most hydrocopters are now equipped with radar, GPS and/or AIS to be able to locate other vessels and to be visible to other vessels. This equipment helps drivers in adverse weather when visibility is very low, which is typical of the Arctic coastal regions. Hydrocopters are one of the few vehicles that can operate in heavy snow or rain. Hydrocopters are also commonly equipped with other safety equipment such as Life jackets, VHF radios and EPIRBs (Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacons). The safety regulations implemented on hydrocopters is the same as the regulations on a boat of that size. Many hydrocopters are built for search and rescue operations and these hydrocopters carry much more safety equipment. The interior of these hydrocopters are outfitted similar to ambulances.        
== Military use ==
The Finnish Border Guard used hydrocopters from the 1970s to the 2000s. The Finnish Border Guard then replaced their fleet of hydrocopters with hovercraft because of stricter work safety standards. Many towns and cities in Finland and Sweden used the surplus military hydrocopters and continue to use hydrocopters today in some capacity as search and rescue craft because they are cheaper than hovercraft and can be used safely in ice and water where other vehicles could not work.

<text>Manuela Georgieva Maleeva (; born 14 February 1967) is a Bulgarian former professional tennis player. She played on the WTA Tour between 1982 and 1994. Through her marriage, Maleeva began representing Switzerland officially from January 1990 until her retirement in February 1994.

One of the most consistent players on tour in the 1980s and early 1990s, Maleeva reached her career-high singles ranking of No. 3 in the world in February 1985 and finished with a year-end top 10 ranking for nine consecutive years (1984 till 1992). A winner of 19 WTA singles titles and four doubles titles, she also reached a total of 14 Grand Slam quarterfinals in her career, including two US Open semifinals in 1992 and 1993, which are her career-best Grand Slam results. She was a semifinalist at the 1987 Virginia Slims Championships.

Maleeva was the bronze medalist in singles at the 1988 Seoul Olympics, winning Bulgaria&#x27;s first (and thus far, only) Olympic tennis medal. In 1992, she paired up with Jakob Hlasek at the Hopman Cup where they took home Switzerland&#x27;s first ever title at the event.

==Career==
Maleeva was born in Sofia, the oldest of the three children of Georgi Maleev and Yuliya Berberyan. Her mother, who came from an Armenian family, was the best Bulgarian tennis player in the 1960s. After she retired from professional tennis in the 1970s, Berberyan started a coaching career. She coached all three of her daughters, Manuela, Katerina, and Magdalena, each of whom became a top six player.

In 1982, Maleeva won the junior French Open, and also made her debut on the senior tour, ending the year ranked in the top 100. After ending the 1983 season in the top 40, she won five tournaments in 1984, and made her debut in the top 10 after defeating Chris Evert in the final of the Italian Open. She also won her only Grand Slam title that year – in mixed doubles at the US Open with American Tom Gullikson.

In 1988, Maleeva-Fragnière won a bronze medal in singles at the Seoul Olympics in Seoul. In 1992 and 1993, Maleeva-Fragnière registered her all-time best achievement in Grand Slam singles competition when she reached the semifinals of the US Open both years (in 1992, after beating youngest sister Magdalena in the quarterfinals).

In 1994, Maleeva-Fragnière retired from professional tennis, after winning the title in Osaka where she beat Iva Majoli in the final. During her 12-year career, she won 19 WTA singles titles, four doubles titles, and one mixed doubles title. She also teamed with Jakob Hlasek to help Switzerland win the Hopman Cup in 1992.

In Fed Cup competition, Maleeva twice helped Bulgaria reach the semifinals (1985 and 1987), and then led Switzerland to the quarterfinals in 1991.

==Personal life==

Maleeva married Swiss tennis coach François Fragnière in December 1987 and from then on, began competing as Manuela Maleeva-Fragnière. She represented Switzerland from 1990 until her retirement. They have three children, Lora, born in 1995, Iva in 1997, Timo in 1999, but divorced in 2003. She currently resides in La Tour-de-Peilz, about 90 km northeast of Geneva across Lake Geneva.

==Retirement life==

Maleeva has been active in politics back in her home country, being one of the founding members of Yes, Bulgaria! which was founded in 2017. The party focuses on institutional reforms and an anti-corruption agenda. Prior to that, she also advocated the 2015 Bulgarian electoral code referendum.

Outside politics, Maleeva is also active in her foundation, Fondation Swissclinical, which she co-founded in 2008. The foundation focuses on helping handicapped children and children in need by providing them with good medical care and long-term support.

<doc id="1092369" wikidata="Q681505" url="?curid=1092369" title="Holloman Air Force Base">
<text>Holloman Air Force Base is a United States Air Force base established in 1942 located six miles (10 km) southwest of the central business district of Alamogordo, which is the county seat of Otero County, New Mexico, United States. The base was named in honor of Col. George V. Holloman, a pioneer in guided missile research. It is the home of the 49th Wing (49 WG) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC).

In addition to hosting several combat wings, Holloman supports the nearby White Sands Missile Range and currently hosts the Royal Air Force RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) Formal Training Unit (FTU) and the Italian Air Force RPA training courses. The base previously hosted the German Air Force Flying Training Center.

==History==

Planned for the British Overseas Training program which was not pursued, construction for the USAAF base west of Alamogordo, New Mexico, began on 6 February 1942. After the nearby Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range was established by Executive Order No. 9029 (range designation on 14 May), the neighboring military installation was designated Alamogordo Field Training Station (27 May) and Alamogordo Army Air Base (operated by the 359th Base Headquarters beginning on 10 June 1942).

===Alamogordo Army Air Field===
Alamogordo Army Air Field (Alamogordo AAFld, Alamogordo AAF) was named on 21 November as a Second Air Force installation equipped with aprons, runways, taxiways and hangars. From 1942 to 1945 the AAF had more than 20 different groups for overseas training, initially flying Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses then Consolidated B-24 Liberators. Training began in 1943 and in addition to the range, a detached installation operated by the base was the Alamogordo Gasoline Storage and Pumping Station Annex.

In 1944 the &quot;base operating unit&quot; changed to the 231st Army Air Force Base Unit (25 March) and 4145 AAFBU (24 August), and on 16 April 1945 Alamogordo AAF was relieved of its training mission and assigned to Continental Air Forces to become a permanent B-29 base. Instead, by 30 January 1946, the base was planned to &quot;be manned by a skeleton crew merely as a plane refuelling station, [for] emergency landings, etc.&quot;, and it was temporarily inactivated on 28 February 1946. Post-war the AAF was used to support the Alamogordo Guided Missile Test Base which had its first Boeing Ground-to-Air Pilotless Aircraft launch on 14 November 1947.

With the September 1947 formation of the USAF, in late 1947 the Holloman range and the White Sands Proving Ground merged to become the New Mexico Joint Guided Missile Test Range (later renamed White Sands Missile Range), and the renamed Holloman Air Force Base (13 January 1948) supported WSMR launch complexes (Launch Complex 33, etc.) firing of Tiny Tim (the first Army rocket), Rascal, V-2 rocket, Ryan XQ-2 Drone, Falcon, MGM-13 Mace, MGM-1 Matador, and AGM-45 Shrike. The 2754th Experimental Wing was activated on 20 September 1949 to oversee all research and development projects.

===Holloman Air Development Center===
The Holloman Air Development Center became the base operating unit on 10 October 1952, and the rocket-powered sled was first run on 19 March 1954. On 10 December 1954, Lt Colonel (Dr.) John P. Stapp rode a Holloman rocket propelled test sled, Sonic Wind No. 1, to a speed of . The center was renamed the Air Force Missile Development Center on 1 September 1957 and inactivated on 1 August 1970.

Additionally, Captain Joseph W. Kittinger, Jr., stepped out of an open balloon gondola at on 16 August 1960, in an attempt to evaluate techniques of high altitude bailout. Capt Kittinger&#x27;s jump lasted 13 minutes, reaching a velocity of . That jump broke four world records: highest open gondola manned balloon flight, highest balloon flight of any kind, highest bailout, and longest free fall.

The Aero-Medical Field Laboratory at Holloman &quot;conducted space flight training with chimpanzees [in] 1961–1962&quot;, including Ham on a suborbital flight launched 31 January 1961, the first great ape in space, and Enos on a 1961 orbital flight as the third great ape to orbit Earth.

===Tactical Fighter Wing===
The 366th Tactical Fighter Wing arrived on 15 July 1963, making Holloman a Tactical Air Command (TAC) operating base. On 8 April 1966, the 4758th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron (DSES) arrived from Biggs AFB Texas. The squadron evaluated aircraft weapons systems and to provide training for air defense units. Aircraft flown by the 4758th DSES were the B-57 Canberra and F-100 Super Sabre. On 31 October 1970 the squadron was merged with the 4677th DSES at Tyndall AFB Florida.

On 1 August 1970, per Air Force Systems Command Special Order G-94, the Air Force Missile Development Center was inactivated. TAC assumed host responsibilities for Holloman Air Force Base. Associate units and programs transferred to other locations within Air Force Systems Command. The Test &amp; Evaluation activities that remained were the Central Inertial Guidance Test Facility (CIGTF), the High Speed Test Track, the Radar Target Scatter Facility (RATSCAT), and the Target Drone Facility.

These organizations were combined to form the nucleus of a Holloman AFB tenant organization, the 6585th Test Group, with the Air Force Special Weapons Center (AFSWC) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, designated as the headquarters for the Test Group.

In 1975, AFSWC was disestablished, and the 6585th Test Group at Holloman became part of the Armament Development and Test Center (ADTC) at Eglin AFB Florida.

===Tactical Training Center===
Holloman was designated a Tactical Training Center on 1 August 1977 and on 1 October 1993, the Air Force Development Test Center at Eglin AFB was redesignated as the Air Armament Center (AAC).

In 1986, a contract was awarded to Flight Systems Inc. (later Honeywell) to modify 194 surplus Convair F-106 Delta Dart aircraft stored at Davis-Monthan AFB Arizona to the QF-106A target drone configuration. This program came to be known as Pacer Six, and the first flight of a converted drone took place in July 1987. Following the completion of an initial batch of ten QF-106s in 1990, most of the work was transferred to the USAF itself. Much of the conversion work was done before the aircraft were removed from storage at AMARC, with further work being carried out at East St Louis, Illinois.

The QF-106s began operating as a Full-Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) in late 1991 at White Sands Missile Range New Mexico, and later at the Eglin Gulf Test Range in Florida (based at Holloman and Tyndall). A typical mission would employ the QF-106 as a target for an infrared homing missile. The aircraft had burners placed on pylons underneath the wings to act as IR sources for heat-seeking missiles. The intention of the program was for the QF-106 to survive repeated engagements with air-to-air missiles, to make it possible for each QF-106 to last as long as possible before it was destroyed. The last shootdown of a QF-106 (57–2524) took place at Holloman AFB on 20 February 1997. The QF-106 was replaced by the QF-4 Phantom drone.

Today, the 96th Test Group from Eglin Air Force Base Florida is responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, and improved maintenance equipment and logistics support.

=== 366th Tactical Fighter Wing ===
On 15 July 1963, after serving at Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, France as a conventional strike force in Europe, the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing moved to Holloman. The move was a result of French president Charles DeGaulle&#x27;s deep suspicion of &quot;supranational organizations&quot; and his country&#x27;s shift away from the NATO orbit in the early 1960s that ultimately led to the closure of American air bases in France.

366th TFW was organized as follows:
* 389th Tactical Fighter Squadron (blue striping)

* 391st Tactical Fighter Squadron (red striping)
* 480th Tactical Fighter Squadron (green striping)
At the time of the wing&#x27;s arrival at Holloman, they flew the Republic F-84F Thunderstreak, which were former Air National Guard aircraft transferred to France during the 1961 Berlin Crisis as part of Operation Tack Hammer. At Holloman, the wing began converting to the new McDonnell Douglas F-4C Phantom II in February 1965.

Later that year, the wing sent its first squadron to the Republic of Vietnam. The 390th Fighter Squadron was assigned to Da Nang AB, and the 391st went to Cam Ranh Bay AB in early 1966.

On 20 March 1966 the rest of the wing entered the conflict and moved to Phan Rang AB, Republic of Vietnam in support of combat operations in Vietnam. With the transfer of the 366th to Vietnam, the 6583d Air Base Group became the host unit at Holloman.

=== 49th Tactical Fighter Wing ===

On 1 July 1968, the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing arrived at Holloman Air Force Base from Spangdahlem AB, West Germany, becoming the first dual-based tactical fighter wing. The 6583d Air Base Group was inactivated in place.

Under the dual-basing concept, the 49th, stationed at Holloman, deployed individual squadrons periodically to Europe, fulfilling their NATO commitment. The operational squadrons of the 49th TFW upon its arrival were:
* 7th Tactical Fighter Squadron (HB/HO, blue)
* 8th Tactical Fighter Squadron (HC/HO, yellow)
* 9th Tactical Fighter Squadron (HD/HO, red)

All three squadrons flew the McDonnell Douglas F-4D Phantom II. In 1972 squadron aircraft tail codes were standardized on &quot;HO&quot;.

In 1969, the wing participated in its first dual-basing exercise, Crested Cap I, deploying 2,000 personnel and 72 aircraft to NATO bases in Europe. Also in 1969, the 49th earned the coveted MacKay Trophy for the &quot;most meritorious flight of the year&quot;, for the redeployment from Germany to Holloman after Crested Cap II. The MacKay Trophy recognized the 49th for the fastest non-stop deployment of jet aircraft accomplished by a wing&#x27;s entire fleet.

In May 1972 the 49th deployed their F-4 aircraft and 2,600 personnel to Takhli RTAFB Thailand. During this deployment the 49th flew more than 21,000 combat hours over just about every battle zone from An Loc to vital installations in the Hanoi vicinity. During five months of combat, the wing did not lose any aircraft or personnel. The unit received an Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat &quot;V&quot; Device for its participation. The 49th TFW officially closed out its Southeast Asia duty on 9 October 1972, turning over Takhli to a former host unit at Holloman, the 366th TFW which was transferred from Da Nang Air Base South Vietnam.

F-15 Eagle era

On 20 December 1977, the wing began converting from the F-4D to F-15A/Bs. The transition was completed on 4 June 1978.

History was made during February 1980, when two pilots from the 49th each flew their F-15s 6,200 miles in just over 14 hours, establishing a record for the longest flight of a single-seat fighter aircraft. The flights required six aerial refuelings, proving the global power of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing.

In July 1980, the wing acquired the commitment of a primary Rapid Deployment Force unit. This tasking, which lasted for a year, required the wing to be ready to deploy its aircraft, crews, and support personnel on short notice. The wing served with the Rapid Deployment Force until July 1981, when the tasking was transferred to the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing, Langley Air Force Base Virginia.

The 49th demonstrated its capabilities in the fall of 1988, winning top honors at the William Tell air-to-air weapons competition. The wing outdistanced the nearest competitor by more than 2,000 points. The 49th won a variety of awards, including the coveted &quot;Top Gun&quot; for best fighter pilot.

F-117 Nighthawk era

From 1991 to 1993, the 49th underwent a number of transitions. On 1 October 1991, the 49th was redesignated the 49th Fighter Wing as part of an Air Force wide redesignation of units.

On 1 November 1991, the 7th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations, performing a Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) mission with Northrop AT-38B Talons, preparing for the transition to the Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk. during most of 1992.

On 1 June 1992 the 8th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations and started flying AT-38B LIFT missions.

The 9th Fighter Squadron ceased F-15 operations on 5 June 1992 and received F-4E aircraft from the 20th Fighter Squadron from the closing George AFB California as the Fighter Training Unit for the German Air Force.

The last F-15 departed Holloman 5 June 1992, ending 14 years of Eagle operations.

On 9 May 1992, four Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighters from the Tonopah Test Range Airport Nevada, arrived at Holloman. The 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Tonopah was inactivated with the transfer of the last F-117s to Holloman on 8 July 1992.

F-117s were initially assigned to the following squadrons:
* 69th Fighter Squadron -&gt; 8th FS (1 July 1993)
* 69th Fighter Squadron -&gt; 9th FS (1 July 1993)
* 417th Fighter Squadron -&gt; 7th FS (1 December 1993)

These squadrons were PCS (moved Permanent Change of Station) to Holloman as part of the 37th Operations Group on 15 June 1992. The formal transfer to the 49th Operations group occurred on 8 July 1992 when the 37th OG was inactivated. In 1993 these squadrons were inactivated with assets transferred to the 7th, 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons. The 7th was designated a combat training squadron, the 8th and 9th being deployable operational fighter squadrons.

On 1 July 1993, the 20th Fighter Squadron was activated as part of the 49th Operations Group, taking over the F-4Es of the 9th FS. The mission of the 20th FS was to conduct training with the German Air Force. The F-4Es which the 20th FS flew initially were USAF-owned aircraft, however in 1997 the squadron began flying German-owned F-4F aircraft. The F-4Fs, however flew in USAF markings. The 20th Fighter Squadron was inactivated on 20 December 2004 and the F-4Fs were flown to the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group. The first arrival, 72-1118, was delivered by Col. Kevin Zeeck on 18 November. The second, 72-1218, arrived at the base two days later. The remaining 14 F-4s arrived at AMARG by the second week of January 2005 in 4 further waves.

The 48th Rescue Squadron was activated at Holloman AFB on 1 May 1993 with its six Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters. The personnel of the 48th deployed six times in support of Operations Northern and Southern Watch. Additionally, the 48th saved 33 lives in real-world rescues in the American Southwest. The unit was inactivated on 1 February 1999.

The 8th and 9th Fighter Squadrons deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy and Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, from 21 February–1 July 1999, in support of Operation Allied Force. Flying more than 1,000 total sorties, pilots flew into heavily defended skies, littered with surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft fire. In particular, F-117A pilots bravely trusting in their aircraft&#x27;s low observable technology struck some of the most valuable, and highly guarded targets in Serbia. The F-117s penetrated the heavily defended areas, which conventional aircraft could not reach, and at least two aircraft were lost.

Global War on Terror

People, airplanes, and equipment of the 49th Fighter Wing played a key role in the continued global war against terrorism and particularly in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The wing&#x27;s F-117s played a major role, dropping the first bombs against an Iraqi leadership target in Baghdad on 19 March 2003. In all, F-117 pilots flew more than 80 missions and dropped nearly 100 enhanced guided bomb units against key targets.

Approximately 300 people deployed with the air package and provided direct support to the F-117 mission. Additionally, hundreds of other 49th FW personnel were deployed on other missions.

===479th Tactical Training Wing===
The 479th TTW was activated at Holloman on 1 January 1977 to provide Lead-In Fighter Training (LIFT) training for pilots assigned to fly tactical fighter or attack aircraft. The 479th Flew AT-38B Talons with the following squadrons:
* 416th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (14 March 1979 – 1 September 1983) (grey stripe)Redesignated 433d TFTS (1 September 1983 – 15 November 1991)
* 434th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (1 January 1977 – 15 November 1991) (red stripe)
* 435th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (1 January 1977 – 15 November 1991) (blue stripe)
* 436th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron (1 January 1977 – 15 November 1991) (yellow stripe)

All 479th TTW aircraft carried the &quot;HM&quot; tail code. The LIFT program was sharply cut back in 1991, and the wing replaced by the 479th Fighter Group at Holloman, with the aircraft being consolidated under the 586th Flight Training Squadron.

The 479th was inactivated on 31 July 2000, with squadron resources absorbed by the 49th FW, later being transferred to the 46th Test Group as the 586th Flight Test Squadron.

== Role and operations ==
The 49th Wing – host wing at Holloman Air Force Base – supports national security objectives by deploying worldwide to support peacetime and wartime contingencies. The wing provides combat-ready Airmen, and trains General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper pilots (including all Spanish and British Reaper pilots), sensor operators and F-16 Fighting Falcon pilots. Additionally, the wing delivers Air Transportable Clinics and Basic Expeditionary Airfield Resources while providing support to more than 17,000 military and civilian personnel to include German Air Force Flying Training center operations. The wing has a proud history of service in World War II, Korea, Southeast Asia, Southwest Asia and NATO-led Operation Allied Force. Holloman AFB supports about 21,000 Active Duty, Guard, Reserve, retirees, DoD civilians and their family members.

Holloman is home to the world&#x27;s longest and fastest high speed test track. The 846th Test Squadron set the world land speed record for a railed vehicle with a run of 6,453 mph (2885 m/s or 10430 km/h), or Mach 8.5 on 30 April 2003.

===49th Wing===
The 49th Wing is the host unit at Holloman Air Force Base, supporting national security objectives with mission-ready MQ-9 Reapers, Air Transportable Medical Clinic and BEAR (Base Expeditionary Airfield Resources) Base assets. The wing deploys combat-ready and mission-support forces supporting Air Expeditionary Force operations, Overseas Contingency Operations, and peacetime contingencies.

The 49th Operations Group supports national security objectives, as directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by utilizing the Air Force&#x27;s MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft. The operational squadrons are:
* 6th Attack Squadron (MQ-9)
* 9th Attack Squadron (MQ-9)
* 16th Training Squadron (MQ-9)
* 29th Attack Squadron (MQ-9)
* 49th Operations Support Squadron

The Operations Group took over the activities of the inactivated 37th Fighter Wing at Tonopah Test Range Airport when the F-117As were transferred to Holloman in 1993. In addition to the 49th OG, other components of the 49th Wing are:
* 49th Maintenance Group: Maintains aircraft, propulsion, avionics and accessory systems for the F-16 C/D Fighting Falcon, T-38 Talon &amp; MQ-9 Reaper.
* 49th Mission Support Group: Provides support to all base operations, personnel, and family members.
* 49th Medical Group: Provides medical services for active duty and retired military members and their families
* 49th Materiel Maintenance Group: Maintains and deploys all equipment needed to build a &quot;BEAR base&quot; airfield
* Detachment 1, 82nd Aerial Targets Squadron (From Tyndall AFB, Florida): Maintains and operates QF-16 Full Scale Aerial Target (FSAT) drone aircraft (Tail Code HD).

In February 2006, the Bush administration announced that Holloman would cease to be home to the F-117A Nighthawk. This move coincided with an announcement that the F-117 will be removed from service on or about 2008. On 1 March 2006, it was announced by the United States Air Force that Holloman would be the new home of two squadrons of F-22A Raptors. In May 2014, with the inactivation of the 7th Fighter Squadron, the F-22 mission ceased at Holloman. The Wing&#x27;s F-22s were transferred to other F-22 wings to bolster their available aircraft.

=== 96th Test Group ===

As of 18 July 2012, the 46th Test Group was &#x27;reflagged&#x27; as the 96th Test Group, under the new 96 TW, stationed at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The 96th Test Group is an Air Force Materiel Command unit responsible for operational testing and evaluation of new equipment and systems proposed for use by these forces. Current initiatives include advanced self-protection systems for combat aircraft, aircrew life support systems, aerial reconnaissance improvements, new armament and weapons delivery systems, and improved maintenance equipment and logistics support.

Squadrons of the group have been:
* 586th Flight Test Squadron – Conducts flight testing
* 746th Test Squadron – Conducts Guidance/Navigational testing to include Internal Global Positioning Systems (GPS)
* 781st Test Squadron – National RCS Test Facility
* 846th Test Squadron – Rocket Sled Tests

Aircraft of the 96th Test Group carry the tail code &quot;HT&quot;.

===54th Fighter Group===
In March 2014 the 54th Fighter Group was reactivated at Holloman AFB, NM with a mission to train F-16 aircrew members and aircraft maintenance personnel. The 54th Fighter Group is a geographically separated unit of the 56th Fighter Wing, out of Luke AFB, Arizona.

Components:
* Operational Squadrons
** 8th Fighter Squadron, 4 August 2017 – present
** 311th Fighter Squadron, 1 March 2014 – present
** 314th Fighter Squadron, 14 July 2015 – present

===German Air Force Flying Training Center===
In 1992 the German Air Force made Holloman its main pilot training center in the United States. Holloman was chosen due to its weather conditions.

On 1 May 1996, the German Luftwaffe established the German Air Force Tactical Training Center at Holloman.

The German Air Force Tactical Training Center activated at Holloman 1 May 1996. With the activation, 300 German military personnel and 12 Panavia Tornado aircraft joined Team Holloman. German aircrews come to Holloman for approximately three weeks for advanced tactical training and then return to Germany. The German Air Force also conducts a Fighter Weapons Instructor Course for the Tornado. Aircrews for this course come to Holloman for about six months.

 there are 650 German military personnel and 25 Tornado aircraft assigned to Holloman AFB.

There are numerous reasons the German Air Force trained at Holloman. The area offers great flying weather and has suitable air space. Other reasons are the proximity of Holloman to the German Air Force Air Defense Center at Fort Bliss, Texas, and the centralizing of German aircrew training at a single location. To facilitate this, there is a memorandum of understanding between the two governments.
By offering NATO allies the benefits of available space at Holloman as well as the use of the Southwest&#x27;s excellent flying weather, the U.S. can help maintain the strength of NATO&#x27;s forces without the expense of forward-basing U.S. forces in great numbers overseas.

On 29 September 1999, two Luftwaffe Tornados crashed near Marathon Indian Basin, about northwest of Carlsbad. The crash was investigated by Holloman AFB 49th Wing Safety and German Air Force Safety personnel. Both pilots successfully ejected, and were uninjured.

In September 2004, Luftwaffe chief of staff, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz announced a reduction in its training program of roughly 20%.

In March 2013, it was announced that German Air Force units at Fort Bliss will transfer to Holloman later that same year; this was to end the German Air Force presence at Fort Bliss dating back to 1956. In 2015, due to funding constraints on the planned new facilities in Europe, the German Air Force Air Defense school was to stay open at Fort Bliss until 2020. On March 13, 2019, after 27 years in southern New Mexico, the German Luftwaffe ceased flight training at Holloman AFB.

===Housing Afghan refugees===

Following the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, the Biden administration housed some Afghan refugees in military bases across the country. Up to ~5,000 Afghan refugees at a time were temporarily held at Holloman while awaiting residency processing, with a total of 7,221 having residence at Aman Omid village.

<text>Geoffrey William Stirling (March 22, 1921 – December 21, 2013) was a Canadian-American businessman and media magnate, best known for his work in his home city of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland.

==Life==
Stirling was born in St. John&#x27;s to Edgar Stiling and Ethel (Uphill) Stirling. He attended the University of Tampa, began his media career as a stringer for &quot;Time&quot; and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and retained close ties to the United States throughout his lifetime, including a second winter home in Arizona in his later years. After his brief time in American media, he spent a brief time in Honduras hunting alligators for skin; he hated the job, but was inspired when he noted that &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; was available there, leading him to conclude that a Newfoundland newspaper would be viable.

Stirling was a co-founder in the Economic Union Party, a late-1940s political movement that sought closer ties to the United States for the Dominion of Newfoundland, which was then still independent from Canada. It was one of two organizations that unsuccessfully opposed the dominion&#x27;s confederation into Canada, which eventually occurred in 1949. The leader of the confederation forces, Joey Smallwood, was an established rival of Stirling&#x27;s, having doubted that Stirling&#x27;s newspaper would succeed because Smallwood himself had failed. Stirling argued that Smallwood&#x27;s overtly political polemics had alienated readers and that a newspaper would need to appeal to a broad audience to succeed.

==Media businesses==
Along with other members of his family, Stirling owned several media outlets in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador under the corporate brand Stirling Communications International. Specifically, the properties are independent television station CJON-DT; radio station CHOZ-FM; and the &quot;Newfoundland Herald&quot;, a weekly news, gossip and TV listings magazine.

Stirling pioneered many television firsts in North America. CJON-TV (NTV) was the first in Newfoundland to air programs in colour. CJON-TV became the first station to broadcast 24 hours a day in 1972.

Stirling was also the founder of CKGM, an English-language radio station in Montreal. in 1959. He owned the station until 1985.

==Personal views==
Stirling is regarded as an eccentric for both how he managed his businesses and for how he used his media outlets to promote a variety of personal interests such as eastern mysticism and intestinal health. For example, he devoted many hours of, often unscheduled, broadcast time to conversations with gurus such as Ram Dass and Swami Shyam and to a variety of esoteric subjects ranging from pyramids to unidentified flying objects, a practice which continues today as the station is run by his son G. Scott Stirling. Geoff&#x27;s grandson, Jesse is the host of the CJON interview program &quot;Meetings with Remarkable People.&quot; Many of his past interviews and archives can be seen currently on CJON on Saturday mornings from 2:00AM to 4:00AM Newfoundland time, under the name &quot;Captain Atlantis Late Night.&quot; When he watched his own television station he would sometimes phone Master Control to order that a favorite tape immediately pre-empt the current broadcast or that the technician apply a particular effect to the screen.

Stirling appeared in the 1974 documentary film &quot;Waiting for Fidel&quot; about a trip he made to Cuba along with former Newfoundland premier Joey Smallwood and director Michael Rubbo. The trio never met the Cuban leader. Many segments of the program involve Smallwood and Stirling discussing what they would like to ask Castro whenever the expected meeting happens. Some of the dialogue occurs while Stirling is demonstrating yoga and standing on his head while he is conversing with Smallwood.

Stirling supervised the creation of the graphic novel &quot;Atlantis&quot; featuring the superheroes Captain Atlantis (Captain Newfoundland) and Captain Canada, drawing on elements of Canadian history as well as ancient alien astronauts mythology and New Age philosophy. Captain Canada has become a mascot for the NTV station and has appeared in television programs, commercials, and numerous public events.

==Later life==
In 2001, Stirling was inducted into the CAB Broadcast Hall of Fame; in 2009, he was awarded the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador. In his later years, Stirling split his time between Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador, and his ranch in Wickenburg, Arizona, where he once owned Wickenburg radio station KSWG. Stirling died at the age of 92 on December 21, 2013.

<text>Francesco Kramer Gorni (22 July 1913 – 26 October 1995), known as Gorni Kramer, was an Italian songwriter, musician and band leader.

== Biography ==
He was born Francesco Kramer Gorni in Rivarolo Mantovano, Lombardy. Despite the exotic sound of Gorni Kramer in the Italian language, which led part of his audience to believe he was a foreigner or had adopted a fancy pseudonym, it was his real name. His family name was Gorni, and Kramer his middle name, after the American cyclist Frank Kramer, who won the road race at the 1912 World Championships and made a strong impression on Gorni&#x27;s father.

Kramer learned music at a very young age, thanks to his father, a musician. The first instrument he learned how to play was the accordion, with which he performed as a child in his father&#x27;s band.

He then studied double bass at the Parma Conservatory and obtained his diploma in 1930. He started working as a musician for dance bands, then in 1933, aged 20, he formed his own jazz group. This new American musical genre was forbidden by the Italian fascist regime, but Gorni Kramer could get to know it thanks to some fellow musicians who worked on board the liners connecting Europe and North America.

In the middle of the 1930s he became a successful songwriter. He composed the music for &quot;Crapa pelada&quot; – lyrics by Tata Giacobetti – a 1936 hit performed by Alberto Rabagliati. In 1939 he wrote &quot;Pippo non lo sa&quot;, one of Trio Lescano&#x27;s most famous songs. In spite of his songs&#x27; popularity, Gorni Kramer and his orchestra were still ignored by the Italian state radio EIAR, who boycotted them because they played jazz.

During World War II he worked with Natalino Otto, a singer also banned by EIAR because of swing. Kramer wrote &quot;Ho un sassolino nella scarpa&quot;, one of Otto&#x27;s greatest hits. In the period he also began a long-lasting cooperation with Quartetto Cetra – for them he wrote memorable songs such as &quot;Nella vecchia fattoria&quot; (the Italian remake of &quot;Old MacDonald Had a Farm&quot;), &quot;In un palco della Scala&quot;, &quot;Donna&quot;, &quot;Concertino&quot;.

In 1949 Gorni Kramer started working for Garinei and Giovannini, a very famous duo of impresarios who authored and produced musical comedies. Writing music for their shows was his main activity for the following ten years. Their most successful productions were &quot;Gran Baldoria&quot;, &quot;Attanasio cavallo vanesio&quot;, &quot;Alvaro piuttosto corsaro&quot;, &quot;Tobia candida spia&quot;, &quot;Un paio d&#x27;ali&quot;. They featured very popular songs such as &quot;Un bacio a mezzanotte&quot;, &quot;Non so dir ti voglio bene&quot;, &quot;Le gocce cadono&quot;, &quot;Chérie&quot;, &quot;Simpatica&quot;.

<text>Halton County is a former county in the Canadian province of Ontario, with an area of . It is also one of the oldest counties in Canada.

==History==

Halton County is named after Major William Mathew Halton (1746–1823), a British Army officer, who was appointed in England in 1805 as Secretary to Upper Canada Lieutenant-Governor Sir Francis Gore and spent little time in Canada during his posting (served two terms, 1806–1811 and 1815–1816).

Settlers started to arrive in the area in the early 1780s. The south was first settled by United Empire Loyalists, and the north was settled mainly by immigrants from the British Isles. In 1788, the area became part of the Nassau District, which was renamed the Home District in 1792.

===Historic townships===
* Esquesing Township (area ). Opened in 1819, the first town meeting was held in 1821 when the population was 424. The name &quot;Esquesing&quot; was said to come from an Indigenous word meaning &quot;the land of the tall pine(s)&quot;, but is more likely to come from the Mississauga word &quot;ishkwessin&quot;, meaning &quot;that which lies at the end&quot;, which was the original name for Bronte Creek. Community centres were Georgetown, Acton, Glen Williams, Stewarttown, Norval, Limehouse.
* Nassagaweya Township (area ). Opened in 1819, its name was derived from the Mississauga word &quot;niizhozaagiwan&quot;, meaning &quot;having two outlets&quot;, which was the original name of the Sixteen Mile Creek. Community centres were Campbellville, Darbyville and Eden Mills.
* Nelson Township (area ) Opened in 1806 and named in honour of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson. Community centre: Burlington.
* Trafalgar Township (area ), opened in 1806, the year after the Battle of Trafalgar. The township was settled in 1807. Community centres were Milton, Oakville, Bronte.

===First Nations land surrenders===
The lands that eventually formed part of Halton were acquired from the Mississauga Indians as follows:

===Municipal organization and evolution===
Along with Wentworth County, Halton County was created in 1816 as part of the Gore District, consisting of the townships of Trafalgar, Nelson, Flamborough, and Beverley, together with certain blocks of land on the Grand River and reserved lands to the rear of the townships of Blenheim and Blandford. In 1821, the county was expanded through the addition of the townships of Esquesing, Erin, Nassagaweya, Eramosa, and Garafraxa, together with certain church land.

In 1838, on the creation of Wellington District, the townships of Garafraxa, Nichol, Woolwich, Guelph, Waterloo, Wilmot, Dumfries, Puslinch, Erin and Eramosa were withdrawn from Halton and transferred to it, to be known as Waterloo County.

Upon the passage of the Act of Union 1840, for electoral purposes Halton became two ridings for electing members to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada:

:* East Riding: the townships of Trafalgar, Nelson, Esquesing, Nassagaweya, East Flamborough, West Flamborough, Erin and Beverley.
:* West Riding: the townships of Garafraxa, Nichol, Woolwich, Guelph, Waterloo, Wilmot, Dumfries, Puslinch and Eramosa.

When the East and West Ridings were renamed for their respective counties in 1845, the township of Erin continued to be part of Halton for electoral purposes.

When the Gore District was abolished in 1850, the township of Erin was fully withdrawn and Halton County was united with Wentworth County to form the United Counties of Wentworth and Halton. As a result of a territorial reorganization in 1851, Halton County was reduced in size, with only the townships of Esquesing, Trafalgar, Nassageweya and Nelson remaining, and the union of counties was abolished in 1854.

As settlement progressed, several urban areas developed and were organized into separate villages and towns:

:* Acton: incorporated as a village in 1874, and erected into a town in 1950.
:* Bronte: incorporated as a village in 1952.
:* Burlington: incorporated as a village in 1872, and erected into a town in 1915.
:* Georgetown: incorporated as a village in 1864, and erected into a town in 1921.
:* Milton: incorporated as a town in 1857.
:* Oakville: incorporated as a town in 1857.

In 1861, the County population was about 22,794.

In 1958, Burlington amalgamated with the township of Nelson and annexed part of the township of East Flamborough. Oakville did the same in 1962, through amalgamation with Bronte and the township of Trafalgar. As a consequence, special legislation was passed to provide that votes of members of the county council were to be allocated according to the populations of the respective municipalities, provided that the combined number of votes for Burlington and Oakville would not be greater than the total votes allocated to the remaining municipalities.

In 1974, Halton County was replaced by the Regional Municipality of Halton.

<doc id="1092385" wikidata="Q13560376" url="?curid=1092385" title="Jane Wagner">
<text>Jane Wagner (born February 26, 1935) is an American writer, director and producer. She is Lily Tomlin&#x27;s comedy writer, collaborator, and wife.

== Early life and education ==
Wagner was born and raised in Morristown, Tennessee, where she developed an interest in writing. She attended Morristown High School, where she wrote for the school newspaper. At 17, she moved from East Tennessee to New York City, where she studied painting and sculpture at the School of Visual Arts and pursued an acting career.

== Career ==
Early in her life, she toured with the Barter Theatre of Abingdon, Virginia, and later became a designer for such firms as Kimberly-Clark and Fieldcrest.

She made her writing debut with the CBS afternoon special &quot;J.T.&quot; (1969), for which she won the Peabody Award — and drew the attention of Tomlin, who was looking for someone to help develop the &quot;Laugh-In&quot; character Edith Ann. It was the beginning of a collaboration that continues to this day.

Wagner has been nominated for Grammy Awards, with Tomlin, for the comic&#x27;s recorded albums and has won three Emmy Awards and a Writers Guild of America award, also with Tomlin, for the comic&#x27;s television specials.

She wrote and directed &quot;Moment by Moment&quot;, starring Tomlin and John Travolta, and wrote &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Woman&quot;, which starred Tomlin.

&quot;The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe&quot; won Wagner a Special Award from the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle and a New York Drama Desk Award. The film adaptation of the play brought Wagner a Cable ACE Award.

Wagner won a second Peabody for the ABC special, &quot;Edith Ann&#x27;s Christmas: Just Say Noel&quot; (1996).

Since its launch in 2008, Wagner has been a contributor to wowOwow.com, a website for women to discuss culture, politics and gossip.

<text>Peel County is a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario. Named for Sir Robert Peel, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the county was organized in 1851. Settlers, however, were in Toronto Township as early as 1807. The Credit River was reserved for the Mississaugas; however, they sold their land and moved to the Bruce Peninsula.

==Formation and history==

The townships that would eventually constitute Peel were initially part of York County in the Home District, and were designated as the West Riding of York in 1845.

The following communities were organized:

The county was created in 1851, forming part of the United Counties of York, Ontario and Peel. It was given its own provisional county council in 1856, and was formally separated from York in 1860.

However, disputes as to whether the county seat should be Malton or Brampton prompted the provisional council to request that the separation be reversed, and an 1862 Act of the Parliament of the Province of Canada brought that into effect, reviving the United Counties of York and Peel. In 1866, the counties were re-separated.

In 1973, Peel County became the Regional Municipality of Peel, as a result of the Ontario provincial government&#x27;s regionalization of the rapidly developing counties surrounding Toronto.

<text>Prescott County is known as a historic county in the Canadian province of Ontario.

It was created in 1800 from a portion of Glengarry County. It was named in honour of Major General Robert Prescott, Governor of Canada at that time. First settlers were Americans, but not all were Loyalists. In 1820, the county was united with Russell County to form United Counties of Prescott and Russell which is still an upper-tier municipality.

==Historic townships==
* Alfred - Named in memory of Prince Alfred, son of King George III, who died as a child of two-years old. Earliest patent was granted to John McKindlay on August 10, 1801. The Township was later merged with North Plantagenet, now Alfred and Plantagenet Township.
* Caledonia - Earliest patent was to Joshua Hall on April 30, 1808. The township was first part of Longueuil and was organized in 1810. It is now part of The Nation Municipality.
* East Hawkesbury - Still exists today as a lower-tier municipality known as East Hawkesbury Township. Crown patent granted to Hon. W.O. Powell, February 10, 1797, Col. William Fortune, March 10, 1787, and Sir John Johnson, May 16, 1798. 
* Longueuil - It was a fief held under the seignorial system of the French regime by the descendants of Charles le Moyne de Longueuil et de Châteauguay. In 1796 the township was purchased by American Nathaniel Hazard Treadwell, who declined to take an oath of loyalty and was deported, in 1812, to the United States. In 1830, he returned and his son Charles Platt Treadwell became sheriff of Prescott and Russell. The Township was later merged with West Hawkesbury, now Champlain Township.
* North Plantagenet - Opened in 1798, first land grant was to Peter Lukin on July 10, 1801. Township was merged with Alfred, now Alfred and Plantagenet Township.
* South Plantagenet - Now part of The Nation Municipality.
* West Hawkesbury - Opened in 1798 it has now been merged with Longueuil, and is now known as Champlain Township.

<doc id="1092398" wikidata="Q663334" url="?curid=1092398" title="Contra proferentem">
<text>Contra proferentem (Latin: &quot;against [the] offeror&quot;), also known as &quot;interpretation against the draftsman&quot;, is a doctrine of contractual interpretation providing that, where a promise, agreement or term is ambiguous, the preferred meaning should be the one that works against the interests of the party who provided the wording. 

==Overview==
The doctrine is often applied to situations involving standardized contracts or where the parties are of unequal bargaining power, but is applicable to other cases. The doctrine is not, however, directly applicable to situations where the language at issue is mandated by law, as is often the case with insurance contracts and bills of lading.

The reasoning behind this rule is to encourage the drafter of a contract to be as clear and explicit as possible and to take into account as many foreseeable situations as it can. Eric Posner claimed: &quot;The contra proferentem rule, for example, might encourage the drafter to be more explicit and to provide more details about obligations. This may reduce the chance that the other party will misunderstand the contract; it also may facilitate judicial interpretation of the contract.&quot; Uri Weiss claimed: &quot;The Contra Proferentem rule motivates the less risk-averse drafter to refrain from manipulating the other side by making the contract unclear. Thus, the two parties can agree that the less risk-averse side will formulate the contract, thus reducing the cost of the transaction. Without this rule, there might be a moral hazard problem&quot;.

Additionally, the rule reflects the court&#x27;s inherent dislike of standard-form take-it-or-leave-it contracts also known as contracts of adhesion (e.g., standard form insurance contracts for individual consumers, residential leases, airline contracts of carriage, etc.). The court perceives such contracts to be the product of bargaining between parties in unfair or uneven positions. To mitigate this perceived unfairness, legal systems apply the doctrine of &quot;contra proferentem&quot;; giving the benefit of any doubt in favor of the party that did not provide the contract.

&quot;Contra proferentem&quot; also places the cost of losses on the party who was in the best position to avoid the harm. This is generally the person who drafted the contract. An example of this is the insurance contract mentioned above, which is a good example of an adhesion contract. There, the insurance company is the party completely in control of the terms of the contract and is generally in a better position, for example, to avoid contractual forfeiture.

==Codification==
The principle is codified in international instruments such as the UNIDROIT Principles and the Principles of European Contract Law, and in some examples of national law:
*in United Kingdom law, with respect to consumer contracts, under Section 69 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, which states &quot;If a term in a consumer contract, or a consumer notice, could have different meanings, the meaning that is most favourable to the consumer is to prevail&quot;.
*in the Brazilian Civil Code, which states that any legal transaction should be interpreted in a way that benefits the party who did not write the terms (article 113, § 1º, IV).
*California Civil Code §1654, enacted in 1872, states &quot;In cases of uncertainty ... the language of a contract should be interpreted most strongly against the party who caused the uncertainty to exist&quot;)
* South Korea&#x27;s ACT ON THE REGULATION OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS §5 states &quot;If the meaning of terms and conditions is not clear, it shall be construed in favor of customers.&quot;

Numerous other states have also codified the rule.

<text>Niagara was a federal electoral district in the Canadian province of Ontario, which was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1867 to 1883. It is sometimes also considered one of Ontario&#x27;s historic counties, as it was listed in some post-Confederation census records as a county of residence.

Niagara consisted of the Lincoln County townships of Niagara and Grantham, including the towns of Niagara-on-the-Lake and St. Catharines.

The electoral district was abolished in 1882 when it was merged into Lincoln and Niagara riding.

<doc id="1092405" wikidata="Q4049259" url="?curid=1092405" title="Sega Superstars">
<text>Sega Superstars is a party video game developed by Sonic Team for the PlayStation 2. It was published by Sega and released in Europe on October 22, 2004; in North America in November 2, 2004; and in Japan in November 11, 2004. The game features several minigames based on various Sega titles that are controlled using the EyeToy peripheral. Upon release, the game received &quot;average&quot; review scores from critics.

==Gameplay==

Gameplay is similar to that of &quot;&quot;, in which players use their body to play a variety of minigames. However, while that game only picked up player&#x27;s movement, &quot;Sega Superstars&quot; uses a more advanced system. Before the start of each game, a setup screen with an orange area is shown. In order to start the game, players have to stand in a position where the orange area won&#x27;t pick up any movement and select the continue button. This method determines what area is the background, allowing EyeToy to pick up the player&#x27;s position, as opposed to just what areas are moving. This is particularly prominent in games like &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot;, which uses the player&#x27;s entire body.

&quot;Sega Superstars&quot; features 12 minigames, each based on different Sega franchises. Rings earned in each game can be used in a Chao Garden mode, in which players raise Chao from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series.
*Sonic the Hedgehog - Using their hands, players must guide Sonic through a tube, collecting rings and Chaos Emeralds while avoiding bombs.
*Super Monkey Ball - Players use their arms to control Ai-Ai as he rolls in a ball through a maze, aiming to reach a goal without falling off the stage.
*Samba de Amigo - Players move their hands over one of the six circles in time to the music.
*Space Channel 5 - Playing as Ulala, players must copy dance moves given by the Morolian opponents by hitting monitors with their arms.
*NiGHTS into Dreams - Using their arms as if they were flying, players guide NiGHTS through a series of rings and collectables.
*The House of the Dead - Players use their body to attack zombies that appear on-screen, being careful not to hit any hostages.
*Virtua Fighter - Players fight against various fighters, following command prompts to attack them while also defending against their attacks.
*Billy Hatcher - Players must use rolling motions to help Billy Hatcher roll a giant egg around and clear each level.
*Puyo Pop Fever - Players use their entire body to funnel colored Puyos into their respective departments, being careful not to accidentally roll in a bomb.
*ChuChu Rocket! - Players use their hands to activate mechanisms and guide ChuChus to a rocket while protecting them from a hungry cat.
*Virtua Striker - Players play as a soccer goalkeeper and try to catch incoming footballs.
*Crazy Taxi - Players attempt to make as much movement and noise as possible to attract the attention of a taxi.

==Development==
Before &quot;Sega Superstars&quot;, few games had made use of the EyeToy. As such, the game was developed as a product that would combine the novelty of this accessory with the familiarity of Sega&#x27;s first-party franchises to extend the long-term viability of the PlayStation 2 console. It was announced in April 2004 and exhibited at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and Tokyo Game Show events of that same year.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of two nines and two sevens for a total of 32 out of 40.

<text>Barenaked for the Holidays is a holiday-themed studio album released by Canadian band Barenaked Ladies on October 5, 2004. The album includes Christmas and Hanukkah songs as well as &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;, which is traditionally sung on New Year&#x27;s Eve. There are also several songs that are simply about the winter season. The album was the first album recorded at Steven Page&#x27;s studio, Fresh Baked Woods and was the first released independently by Barenaked Ladies&#x27; Desperation Records label (and distributed by the Warner Music Group). It was the band&#x27;s first studio album for which a &quot;naked track&quot; (recorded in the nude) was not recorded. This album achieved Gold status in Canada.

Barenaked Ladies also collaborated with fellow Canadian artists Sarah McLachlan (&quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot;, originally recorded in August 1996) and a then relatively unknown Michael Bublé (&quot;Elf&#x27;s Lament&quot;).

==Production==
While the album contains some faithful interpretations of traditional songs, much of the album plays true to Ladies&#x27; off-kilter spirit. &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; begins as a slow, faithful rendition before breaking into an up-tempo version, including the &quot;Batman smells...&quot; lyric variation, and Page breaking down laughing. Several existing songs are included in the form of keyboard interludes; &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; is included as a hidden track in the form &quot;Happy Birthday Jesus&quot;. The song &quot;Deck the Stills&quot; is an adaptation or parody of the song &quot;Deck the Halls&quot; with the lyrics &quot;Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young&quot; repeated in place of the real lyrics (it was an in-joke with the band at the time to use these lyrics in other songs).

The album also includes the Band Aid charity song, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, all the royalties from which the band donates to the Stephen Lewis Foundation. The collaboration with Sarah McLachlan for &quot;God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen&quot; was released on a prior compilation, &quot;Christmas Songs&quot;, in 2000. Finally, the album includes seven songs written by the band.

The album was a popular release during the Christmas season of 2004, and reached No. 64 in the regular &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts. Barenaked Ladies promoted the album with the Barenaked for the Holidays Tour in 2004 and 2005.

Former member Steven Page later admitted that the album was not his idea, and that a holiday themed album was not what he wanted to do following &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;.

==Releases==

===E.P. Version===
An E.P. of Hanukkah-themed songs named the &quot;Barenaked for Hanukkah E.P.&quot; was released as a digital download on November 15, 2005. It contains a live version of &quot;Hanukkah, O Hanukkah&quot; from the band&#x27;s Toronto concert on November 20, 2004, as well as the album versions of &quot;Hanukkah Blessings&quot; and &quot;I Have a Little Dreidel&quot;. It was certified gold in Canada.

===&quot;Barenaked on a Stick&quot;===
&quot;Barenaked on a Stick&quot; is a 128MB USB flash drive that contains the &quot;Holidays&quot; CD, live songs and ad libs, a demo recording, videos of the album recording, promo photos and buddy icons for instant messaging programs. It was sold initially at the 2005 holiday concert tour, and then through Nettwerk&#x27;s online store, and though Amazon.com. The USB stick was part of a product test by the band to see if there was a market for releasing albums on reusable media. Their next album &quot;Barenaked Ladies Are Me&quot; was also released on USB flash drive, as were subsequent live recordings.

==&quot;Rock Band&quot;==
The song &quot;Hanukkah Blessings&quot; was released on the &quot;Rock Band&quot; music store on December 23, 2008.

<text>Blackstar were a British hard rock band, formed as a retooling of the band Carcass in 1995 without Bill Steer along with former Cathedral bassist Mark Griffiths (on guitar). The band name comes from a Carcass song off the &quot;Swansong&quot; 1996 album. 
Blackstar released only a single album.
After a while, the band was forced to change its name to Blackstar Rising. The band dissolved because drummer Ken Owen suffered from a brain haemorrhage.

<doc id="1092415" wikidata="Q1751396" url="?curid=1092415" title="Nesscliffe">
<text>Nesscliffe is a village in Shropshire, England, located north of the River Severn. The village comes under the Great Ness parish.

The A5 road, which previously ran through the village, now runs around the village on a dual-carriageway by-pass.

==Local Government==
Nesscliffe is represented on the Great Ness and Little Ness Parish council, which meet on the first Tuesday of every month, except for January and August, at Nesscliffe Village Hall or Little Ness Village Hall. It is also represented on the unitary Shropshire Council and in the Shrewsbury and Atcham Parliamentary constituency.

==Amenities==
The village has a primary school (St Andrew&#x27;s C.of.E.) and post office. There is one working pub, &quot;The Old Three Pigeons&quot;; a former pub, the &quot;Nesscliffe Hotel&quot;, was ultimately a Chinese restaurant/takeaway called &quot;China Rose&quot; but it has been closed and near-derelict for a number of years. It appears that the owners wish to develop the site for housing.

The Nesscliffe Village Hall is used by the whole community for clubs, groups, meetings and events. There is a strong and dedicated committee who ensure that the Hall is well maintained, and who organise events throughout the year. Events and news are published on the community website and Facebook page.

==Local landmarks==
The site of a cave used by the highwayman, Humphrey Kynaston now forms part of the Nesscliffe Hill Country Park. One mile south-west are the earthwork remains of Wilcott Castle, a small motte castle. The independent girls&#x27; boarding school Adcote is situated in the parish, in the nearby village of Little Ness.

The Great Ness parish First World War war memorial, in form of a red sandstone cross, is located in Nesscliffe at the old A5 roadside. It lists nine men who died and 57 who served in that war.

===Nesscliffe Hill Country Park===
Nesscliffe Country park lies just off the A5 between Oswestry and Shrewsbury. The &quot;Old Three Pigeons Inn&quot;, dated back to the 15th century, is located south of the entrance to the Park and was said to be the watering hole of Humphrey Kynaston. Inside, the seat from Kynaston&#x27;s cave is now part of the Inn&#x27;s fireplace. The park itself is divided into three areas, from south to north: Nesscliffe Hill, Hopton Hill and The Cliffe (latter also accessible by footpath from Ruyton-XI-Towns). Shruggs Common, believed to be the smallest common in Shropshire of approximately 1/4 acre, is found on Nesscliffe Hill.

===Nesscliffe Rock Cave===
The Nesscliffe Rock Cave is part of the Nesscliffe Country Park. It is a small sandstone cave and is better known as &quot;Kynaston&#x27;s Cave&quot; as it is the place he and his steed Beelzebub sought refuge. The entrance to the cave is six metres above ground level and stairs were cut into the soft rock, however over time the stairs have eroded. Inside the cave can be seen two chambers approximately four square metres big and the date 1564 carved into one of the walls, followed by the initials of H.K., reputedly of Humphrey Kynaston. A wooden staircase once existed to give access to the cave but was not extant as of 2015; today the steps have been fenced off and the mouth and window of the cave shut off by grids.

==CAD Nesscliffe==
During the 1930s, there was a recognition of a need to provide secure storage for munitions within the United Kingdom. The proposal was to create three Central Ammunition Depots (CAD) in easily hewn and relatively horizontal rocks: one in the south (Monkton Farleigh); one in the north of England (Longtown, Cumbria); and one in the Midlands (Nesscliffe).

While Monkton Farleigh came into operations in 1939, CAD Nesscliffe was developed by the War Office/Ministry of Defence after the start of World War II. To service the extensive property, the MoD took over the virtually defunct Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway from 1941, and built extensive additional service tracks along the of railway line from Maesbrook to the former Ford and Crossgate railway station, south of the River Severn.

Like a typical ammunition depot, the site was laid out over an extensive area to avoid total destruction should an accidental explosion occur, or the site be attacked by enemy. The site was made up of four sub-sites: Kinnerley, Pentre, Ford, and Argoed. The four sites were capable of storing around of shells.

There was also a sub-site at Loton Park, under the Alberbury medieval deer park, used for storage of both incendiary ammunition and chemical weapons shells from 1943. This was one of two CW depots operated in co-operation with and guarded by the United States Army Air Forces, the second being in Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

Locomotives and train drivers were provided by the Royal Engineers, who also maintained the extensive network. Their main servicing depot for rolling stock was on the stub-junction of the former branchline to Criggion. Ammunition storage officially stopped in 1959 on site, and the ammunition depot closed in 1961, when the railway tracks were removed. Operational locomotives were moved to the Longmoor Military Railway, while the non-operational were sold-off commercially. Since 1961 the site has been part of the Nesscliffe Training Area.

<doc id="1092417" wikidata="Q14479991" url="?curid=1092417" title="Well-Manicured Man">
<text>The Well-Manicured Man is a fictional character in the American science fiction television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. He serves as an antagonist to FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), being a member of the sinister Syndicate the agents seek to foil. Introduced in the third season, the Well-Manicured Man served to highlight discord within the ranks of the Syndicate, and ultimately betrayed them by leaking information to Mulder before committing suicide in the series&#x27; first feature film.

The Well-Manicured Man was portrayed by John Neville in all of the character&#x27;s appearances (eight episodes, and the feature film). According to the series&#x27; writers, the character represents a non-violent &quot;voice of reason&quot; amongst the series&#x27; antagonists. Neville&#x27;s portrayal of the Well-Manicured Man has been positively received by critics, who have noted his &quot;moral ambivalence&quot; and &quot;unnervingly genteel&quot; manner.

==Character arc==
Introduced at the beginning of the third season, the Well-Manicured Man is an English member of the Syndicate, a shadow organization within the United States government that exists to hide from the public the fact that aliens are planning to colonize the Earth. He is an important member of the Syndicate, along with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and The Elder, and was a friend of William Mulder earlier in his life.

The Well-Manicured Man prefers subtlety to brute force, and will attempt to manipulate those in his way before using physical violence. Although the Syndicate&#x27;s goals are opposed to those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), the Well-Manicured Man will, at times, aid them with clues or information, believing that letting out a certain amount of information would help to keep the two close, and consequently allow for them to be controlled. The Well-Manicured Man openly despises The Smoking Man, seeing him as impulsive and unprofessional. The two maintain a bitter relationship within the Syndicate throughout the series. The Well-Manicured Man is instrumental in the Syndicate&#x27;s secondary agenda, to develop a vaccination against the black oil used by the aliens as a means of mind control. To this end, he works with Russian double agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) to develop a vaccine, eventually testing it—successfully—on a Syndicate mole, Marita Covarrubias (Laurie Holden).

In the 1998 feature film &quot;The X-Files&quot;, when Scully is infected with the black oil and taken to Antarctica, it is the Well-Manicured Man who, having grown disillusioned with the Syndicate, gives Mulder the coordinates needed to find her and a sample of the vaccine needed to cure Scully. The colonists had kept secret a secondary characteristic of the black oil—that those infected with it for prolonged periods would gestate a new colonist lifeform, killing the host. Upon discovering this, the Syndicate vowed to work more closely with the colonists in the hope of being spared this fate, while only the Well-Manicured Man wished to continue working on a vaccination for resistance. This rejection led to his betrayal of the Syndicate, and to him committing suicide by car bomb before his duplicity was discovered.

==Conceptual history==

John Neville has stated that he was originally hired for just two episodes of the series, but that his character &quot;was regularly brought back, because the audience simply doesn&#x27;t know if he stands for good or evil&quot;. Series creator Chris Carter has described the character in terms of his relationship with The Smoking Man, noting that the two characters can be seen as &quot;differing in approach, differing in philosophy and differing in personality&quot;. Writer Frank Spotnitz has described the Well-Manicured Man as &quot;sort of the white knight to the Cigarette-Smoking Man&#x27;s black knight in this chess game that we were playing&quot;.

The character has also been described by Carter and Spotnitz as the &quot;voice of reason&quot; within the Syndicate, who &quot;believes that violence is the wrong way to protect the secret&quot; which they guard. The Well-Manicured Man&#x27;s suicide scene in the series&#x27; film adaptation went through several conceptual iterations, with outcomes being considered including an imploding car or suicide by concussion grenade, although ultimately a car bomb scene was decided upon.

==Reception==
The character of the Well-Manicured Man has been positively received by critics. MTV&#x27;s Tami Katzoff has called him a &quot;legendary TV character&quot;, noting his &quot;moral ambivalence about the work of his shadow organization&quot; and his ability to show &quot;empathy for Mulder and Scully&quot;. Writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, Sean O&#x27;Neal praised the character&#x27;s &quot;unnervingly genteel&quot; manner, noting that he represented the polar opposite of The Smoking Man. Fellow A.V. Club writer Emily VanDerWerff has also been positive towards the Well-Manicured Man, feeling that the series would have benefited from making more use of the character. &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; Bob Graham has praised Neville&#x27;s portrayal of the character in the feature film, calling his expository monologue &quot;a Wagnerian demonstration of the art of declamation&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;, Michael Liedtke and George Avalos described the character as &quot;white-haired, urbane, genteel[—]and dangerous&quot;, noting that he was &quot;equally at ease in Virginia&#x27;s horse country, the tony rooms of Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side and the antiseptic halls of facilities that house bizarre medical experiments&quot;. Den of Geek&#x27;s countdown of &quot;The Top 10 X-Files Baddies&quot; described the Well-Manicured Man as a &quot;super-smooth, super-creep Brit&quot;, noting that he served as &quot;a &#x27;boss&#x27; of sorts&quot; for the Smoking Man. Speaking of how the role eclipsed his other acting work, Neville has been quoted as saying &quot;It&#x27;s OK, though. [&quot;The X-Files&quot;] gave me a kind of profile that I didn&#x27;t have before, and one shouldn&#x27;t grumble about that&quot;.

<doc id="1092425" wikidata="Q255792" url="?curid=1092425" title="Guernsey pound">
<text>The pound is the currency of Guernsey. Since 1921, Guernsey has been in currency union with the United Kingdom and the Guernsey pound is not a separate currency but is a local issue of sterling banknotes and coins, in a similar way to the banknotes issued in Scotland, England and Northern Ireland (see Banknotes of the pound sterling). It can be exchanged at par with other sterling coinage and notes (see also sterling area).

For this reason, ISO 4217 does not include a separate currency code for the Guernsey pound; when distinction from sterling is desired the abbreviation GGP may be used.

==History==

Until the early 19th century, Guernsey used predominantly French currency. Coins of the French livre were legal tender until 1834, with French francs used until 1921. In 1830, Guernsey began production of copper coins denominated in &quot;doubles&quot;. The double was worth of a French franc. The name &quot;double&quot; derived from the French &quot;double deniers&quot;, although the value of the coin was equal to the liard (three-denier piece) still circulating. Coins were issued in denominations of 1, 2, 4 and 8 doubles. The 8 double coin was a &quot;Guernsey penny&quot;, with twelve to the &quot;Guernsey shilling&quot; (worth 1.2 francs). However, this shilling was not equal to the British shilling (worth 1.26 francs, as the exchange rate according to the respective gold standards was 25.22 francs = 1 pound sterling). Banknotes were also produced by the States of Guernsey from 1827, denominated in pounds. In 1848, an ordinance was passed that the pound sterling should be legal tender at a value of £1 1s 3d (2040 doubles). This was rescinded two years later and French currency, supplemented by local issues, continued to circulate. In 1870, British coins were made legal tender, with the British shilling circulating at Guernsey pence. Bank of England notes became legal tender in 1873. In 1914, new banknotes appeared, some of which carried denominations in Guernsey shillings and francs.

After the First World War, the value of the franc began to fall relative to sterling. This caused Guernsey to adopt a pound equal to the pound sterling in 1921. For amounts below 1 shilling, the conversion rate of 1 Guernsey penny (8 doubles) = 1 British penny applied, allowing the Guernsey coins to continue to circulate. For amounts above 1 shilling, an exchange rate of 21 Guernsey shillings to the pound sterling was used, applying an approximation to the pre-war exchange rate of 25.2 francs = 1 pound sterling, rather than the exact rate of 25.22. This conversion increased the value of the double from to of a pound, or half of a farthing. The World War I issues of banknotes were overstamped with the word &quot;British&quot; to indicate this change. New banknotes and British silver coinage circulated alongside the double coins, with 3-pence coins minted specially for Guernsey from 1956.

In 1971, along with the rest of the British Isles, Guernsey decimalised, with the pound subdivided into 100 pence, and began issuing a full range of coin denominations from p to 50p (£1 and £2 coins followed later).

==Legal tender==

The Guernsey pound, and other notes denominated in sterling (including those issued by the Bank of England, Scottish, Manx and Northern Irish notes and the Jersey pound) may be used in Guernsey. The Guernsey pound is legal tender only in the Bailiwick of Guernsey although it also circulates freely in Jersey, while in the UK acceptance is often problematic. It can also be exchanged in other places at banks and bureaux de change.

Around £51m of coins and notes are in circulation.

==Coins==

Between 1830 and 1956, Guernsey&#x27;s four coin denominations, 1, 2, 4 and 8 doubles (equivalent to d, d, d and 1d respectively), all carried very similar designs, with the Island&#x27;s arms and name (spelled &quot;Guernesey&quot;) on the obverse and the denomination and date on the reverse. In addition, the 8 double coins featured a wreath on both sides.

In 1956, new designs were introduced for the 4 and 8 doubles (the lower denominations were no longer issued). These featured the Island&#x27;s seal and name (now given as &quot;S&#x27;Ballivie Insule de Gernereve&quot;) on the obverse with the English name, the date and the Guernsey lily on the reverse. Threepence coins were also issued from 1956, with the same obverse and a reverse featuring the Guernsey cow.

As in the UK, 5 and 10 new pence coins were introduced in 1968, followed by 50 new pence coins in 1969, before decimalisation took place in 1971 and the , 1 and 2 new pence coins were introduced. These coins were the same size and composition as the corresponding British coins. The word &quot;new&quot; was dropped in 1977.

A £1 coin was introduced in 1981, two years before its introduction in the UK, although the 20 pence and £2 coins were introduced at the same time as in the UK: 1982 and 1998, respectively. The 1981 coin was significantly thinner than the modern version and the diameter also measured slightly less. The £1 coin ceased to be legal tender on 15 October 2017, to coincide with the withdrawal of the circular £1 coin in the UK. The UK&#x27;s new twelve-sided £1 coin is the only £1 coin that is legal tender on the island.

The first decimal issues continued with the same obverse as the last pre-decimal issues until 1985, when Raphael Maklouf&#x27;s portrait of Queen Elizabeth II was added. Ian Rank-Broadley&#x27;s portrait of the Queen has appeared since 1998.

Designs on the reverses of Guernsey&#x27;s decimal coins are:

==Banknotes==

In 1827, the States of Guernsey introduced one-pound notes, with the &quot;Guernsey Banking Company&quot; and the &quot;Guernsey Commercial Banking Company&quot; also issuing one-pound notes from 1861 and 1886, respectively. The commercial banks lost their right to issue notes in 1914, although the notes circulated until 1924. Also in 1914, the States introduced five- and ten-shilling notes, also denominated as 6 and 12 francs.

In 1921, States notes were over-stamped with the word &quot;British&quot; to signify the island&#x27;s conversion to a pound equal to sterling. From 1924, ten-shilling notes were issued without any reference to the franc. The five-shilling note was discontinued.

In 1941, during the German occupation, notes were introduced in denominations of 6 pence, 1 shilling 3 pence, 2 shillings 6 pence and 5 shillings. The first to be issued were the 5-shilling and 2s 6d notes. They were printed on States of Guernsey watermarked paper; the height of the notes was inches; the length of the 2s 6d note was inches and that of the 5s note was inches. The 5s note was printed in black and red with the Seal of the Bailiwick in red on the reverse. The 2s 6d note was printed in light blue with the denomination in orange and the Seal of the Bailiwick in royal blue on the reverse. From 1942, the 1s 3d notes were overprinted to produce 1-shilling notes. In 1945, following liberation, £5 notes were introduced and production of all denominations below 10 shillings ended.

The 10 shilling note was replaced by the 50-new-pence coin in the run up to decimalisation. £10 notes were introduced in 1975, followed by £20 in 1980 and £50 in 1994. Although £1 and £2 coins have been introduced, the £1 note still circulates.

A commemorative £20 note was issued in 2012 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. It is similar to the regular issue, but with the QE60 letter prefix, the commemorative laurel wreath on the lower left corner of the note, and additional wording. A total of 150,000 notes were issued.

A commemorative £1 note was issued on 4 July 2013 to mark 200 years since the first commercial operation of Thomas De La Rue. The commemorative note is in circulation alongside the standard £1 note, differing in the portrait of De La Rue on the reverse and a TDLR letter prefix.

On 8 November 2018, a commemorative banknote of £20 was issued to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. It is like the preceding 2012 commemorative issue, but with the seal of the Bailiwick of Guernsey surrounded by poppy flowers and containing the serial letter prefix &quot;TG/W&quot; (for &quot;The Great War&quot;).

In January 2023 Guernsey advised that notes produced for the island by De La Rue plc will in future include PUREIMAGE™ and IGNITE® security threads and the NEXUS™ embedded stripe.

<text>Tawang district (Pron:/tɑ:ˈwæŋ or təˈwæŋ/) is the smallest of the 26 administrative districts of Arunachal Pradesh state in northeastern India. With a population of 49,977, it is the eighth least populous district in the country (out of 707).

== History ==

Tawang is inhabited by the Monpa people. From 500 BC to 600 AD a kingdom known as Lhomon or Monyul ruled the area. The Monyul kingdom was later absorbed into the control of neighbouring Bhutan and Tibet.

Tawang Monastery was founded by the Merak Lama Lodre Gyatso in 1681 in accordance with the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama, Ngawang Lobsang Gyatso, and has an interesting legend surrounding its name, which means &quot;Chosen by Horse&quot;. The sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, was born in Tawang.

Tawang was historically part of Tibet. The 1914 Simla Accord defined the McMahon Line as the new boundary between British India and Tibet. By this treaty, Tibet relinquished several hundred square miles of its territory, including Tawang, to the British, but it was not recognised by China. When Tibet was not governed by mainland China, Tawang was easily accessible to Tibetans.

In 1938, the British made a cautious move to assert sovereignty over Tawang by sending a small military column under Capt. G.S. Lightfoot to Tawang.

After the outbreak of the war with Japan in 1941, the government of Assam undertook a number of &#x27;forward policy&#x27; measures to tighten their hold on the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA) area, which later became Arunachal Pradesh. In 1944, administrative control was extended over the area of the Tawang tract lying South of the Sela Pass when J.P. Mills set up an Assam Rifles post at Dirang Dzong. However, no steps were taken to evict the Tibetan from the area North of the pass which contained Tawang town.

Tibet lost its independence in the 1950s and was annexed into the newly established People&#x27;s Republic of China. Tibet also lost its independent diplomatic freedom and Tawang was now a stress point between India and China.

During the Sino-Indian war of 1962, Tawang fell briefly under Chinese control, but China withdrew its troops at the end of the war. Tawang again came under Indian administration.

Tawang district was formed in 1989, when it was split from West Kameng district.

The Yangtse clash of 9 December 2022 occurred at night between the troops of the Indian Army and the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) along their mutually contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Yangtse region of Tawang. Later Chinese army retreat and Indian army won in clash.

==Geography==
Tawang district, the basin of 
Tawang Chu, occupies an area of . The district is roughly located around latitude 27° 45’ N and longitude 90° 15’ E at the northwest extremity of Arunachal Pradesh. Elevations range between 6,000 and , and inhabitants are found at lower altitude, where they enjoy a cool temperate climate.

The district was carved out of the West Kameng district, which adjoins it to the south and east. Bhutan borders Tawang to the west whereas Tibet is to the north of the district. The district occupies an area of 2,085 square kilometres and has a population of 38,924 (as of 2001), almost 75% of which are considered &quot;tribal&quot;, i.e. belonging to the native Monpa, Bhotia, Adi, etc. The sensitivity of the border area brings Tawang a heavy military presence.
In winter, Tawang frequently experiences heavy snowfall.

==Administrative divisions==
The district is divided into 3 sub-divisions: Tawang, Lumla and Jang. Tawang sub-division is divided into 2 administrative circles: Tawang and Kitpi. Lumla sub-division is divided into 4 administrative circles: Bongkhar, Dudunghar, Lumla and Zemithang. Jang sub-division is divided into 4 administrative circles: Jang, Mukto, Thingbu and Lhou.

There are 3 Arunachal Pradesh Legislative Assembly constituencies located in this district: Lumla, Tawang and Mukto. All of these are part of Arunachal West Lok Sabha constituency.

Both the Dungyur and Torgya festivals are celebrated at the Tawang Monastery with traditional gaiety and enthusiasm.

==Transport==
The proposed Mago-Thingbu to Vijaynagar Arunachal Pradesh Frontier Highway along the McMahon Line, (will intersect with the proposed East-West Industrial Corridor Highway) and will pass through here, alignment map of which can be seen here and here.

== Economy ==
Most of the tribes depend on agriculture for a living. Owing to Tawang&#x27;s cold climate, farmers breed yak and sheep, although in lower altitudes crops are also planted.

===Tourism===
Tawang is a popular tourist destination thanks to the well-preserved Tawang Monastery. The Sela Pass rises steeply and is covered with snow for most of the year. Chumi Gyatse Falls and Jang waterfall is a big tourist attraction.

Tawang district has a handicrafts centre that promotes the small-scale industries for local handicrafts.

Visitors to Tawang district require a special Inner Line Permit from the government which are available in Kolkata, Guwahati, Tezpur, and New Delhi. Most of the travel from the plains is on a steep hill road journey, crossing Sela Pass at . Tourists can travel to Tawang from Tezpur, Assam by road. Tezpur has direct flights from Kolkata. Guwahati, Assam, is 16 hours by road. In June 2008, a daily helicopter service from Guwahati was started by the Arunachal Pradesh government.

Road travel to Tawang from Tezpur, Assam, is by buses, private taxis and shared taxis. It is an arduous journey: most of the road is loose tarmac and gravel giving way to mud in many places. However, it is a scenic journey of nearly 12 hours, crossing Bomdila Pass 2,438 metres (8,000 feet), peaking at Sela Pass 4,176 metres (13,700 feet), Jaswant Garh and, finally, Tawang. Government buses often break down (usually on the way up) and passengers end up hitchhiking in private cars and taxis. En route, local food is available, especially meat and vegetarian momos and cream buns.

Tawang also hosted the 2nd International Tourism Mart in October 2013.

==Culture==

===Tawang Monastery===


The Tawang Monastery was founded by the Mera Lama Lodre Gyatso in accordance to the wishes of the 5th Dalai Lama, Nagwang Lobsang Gyatso. The monastery belongs to the Gelugpa sect and is the largest Buddhist monastery in India. It is associated with Drepung Monastery in Lhasa. The name Tawang means &quot;Chosen Horse&quot;. It is also known by another Tibetan name, Galden Namgey Lhatse, which means a true name within a celestial paradise in a clear night.

===Dalai Lama===
When the current Dalai Lama (14th Dalai Lama) fled from Tibet in 1959 to escape from the Chinese army, he crossed into India on 30 March 1959 and spent some days resting at Tawang Monastery before reaching Tezpur in Assam on 18 April. As recently as 2003, the Dalai Lama said that Tawang was &quot;actually part of Tibet&quot;. He reversed his position in 2008, acknowledging the legitimacy of the McMahon Line and the Indian claim to the region.

The Dalai Lama visited Tawang district on 8 November 2009. About 30,000 persons, including those from neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan, attended his religious discourse.

<doc id="1092446" wikidata="Q363749" url="?curid=1092446" title="William Crawford (soldier)">
<text>William Crawford (September 2, 1722 – June 11, 1782) was an American military officer and surveyor who worked as a land agent alongside George Washington while Washington was a teenager. Crawford fought in the French and Indian War, Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War and the American Revolutionary War arising to the rank of Colonel. In 1782, his unit was attacked, and while he and his surgeon escaped for less than one day, Crawford was eventually captured where he was tortured and burned at the stake by Crawford&#x27;s former soldier turned British agent, Simon Girty, and Captain Pipe, a Chief of the Delaware Nation. 

==Early career==
Crawford was born on September 2, 1722, in Westmoreland County, Virginia. Before a 1995 genealogical study by Allen W. Scholl, his birth year was erroneously estimated to be 1732. He was a son of William Crawford Sr and his wife Honora Grimes, who were Scots-Irish farmers. William Crawford Sr was a Presbyterian of Scottish descent from Coleraine, Ireland in what is today Northern Ireland and Honora Grimes was a Presbyterian of Scottish descent from Ballymoney, Ireland in what is today Northern Ireland. After his father&#x27;s death in 1736, Crawford&#x27;s mother married Richard Stephenson. Crawford had a younger brother, Valentine Crawford, plus five half-brothers and one half-sister from his mother&#x27;s second marriage. Crawford&#x27;s first cousin, Benjamin Lewis, led a campaign along with Thomas Jefferson in December 1768 on the need for expanded surveys in the Kanawha and Ohio region after the ratification of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in November. Crawford under the direction of Washington eventually led subsequent surveys of the Kanawha, Ohio and Kentucky region in the years afterwards through 1773.
In 1742 Crawford married one Ann Stewart, with whom he had one child, a daughter also named Ann, in 1743. Apparently she died in childbirth or soon after, and on January 5, 1744, he married Hannah Vance, said to have been born in Pennsylvania in 1723. Their son John married one Effie Grimes; Ophelia married William McCormick, who served as a Captain during the Northwest Indian Wars, and Sarah who married Major William Harrison who was captured and killed by Captain Pipe. Simon Girty, before he tortured and killed Crawford, lied and told Crawford his son-in-law was alive and being held prisoner by a separate Shawnee, who had already been killed. 

In 1749, Crawford became acquainted with George Washington, who at the time was still a teenager and just recently appointed as the surveyor of Culpeper County. Crawford, more seasoned, accompanied Washington on several surveying trips. In 1755, Crawford commissioned in the Virginia militia and served in the Braddock expedition holding the rank of ensign. Like Washington, he survived the disastrous Battle of the Monongahela. During the French and Indian War, he served in Washington&#x27;s Virginia Regiment, guarding the Virginia frontier against Native American raiding parties. In 1758, Crawford was a member of General John Forbes&#x27;s army which captured Fort Duquesne, where Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, now stands. He continued to serve in the military, taking part in Pontiac&#x27;s War in 1763.

In 1765 Crawford built a cabin on the Braddock Road along the Youghiogheny River in what is now Connellsville, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. His wife and three children joined him there the following year. Crawford supported himself as a farmer and fur trader. When the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix with the Iroquois opened up additional land for settlement, Crawford worked again as a surveyor, locating lands for settlers and speculators. Governor Robert Dinwiddie had promised bounty land to the men of the Washington&#x27;s Virginia Regiment for their service in the French and Indian War. In 1770 Crawford and Washington travelled down the Ohio River to choose the land to be given to the regiment&#x27;s veterans. The area selected was near what is now Point Pleasant, West Virginia. Crawford also made a western scouting trip in 1773 under the approval of Lord Dunmore, Governor of Virginia which was led by Thomas Bullitt. The expedition of over 40 men included Joshua Morris, Capt. Matthew Arbuckle, John Alderson, and Colonel John Field. Washington could not accompany them because of the sudden death of his stepdaughter. During the expedition, Arkbuckle and Alderson found the Kanawha Burning Springs, who Thomas Hanson in 1774 described as &quot;one of the wonders of the world. Put a blaze of pine within 3 or 4 inches of the water, and immediately the water will be in a flame, &amp; Continue so until it is put out by the Force of wind. The Springs are small and boil continually like a Pot on the Fire; the water is black &amp; has a Taste of Nitre.&quot; 

At the outbreak of Dunmore&#x27;s War in 1774, Crawford received a promotion to major from Lord Dunmore. He built Fort Fincastle at present Wheeling, West Virginia. He also led an expedition which destroyed two Mingo villages (near present Steubenville, Ohio) in retaliation for Chief Logan&#x27;s raids into Virginia.

Crawford&#x27;s service to Virginia in Dunmore&#x27;s War was controversial in Pennsylvania, since the colonies were engaged in a bitter dispute over their borders near Fort Pitt. Crawford had been a justice of the peace in Pennsylvania since 1771, first for Bedford County, then for Westmoreland County when it was established in 1773. Beginning in 1776, Crawford served as a surveyor and justice for Virginia&#x27;s short-lived Yohogania County.

==American Revolution==

When the American Revolutionary War began, Crawford initially was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the 5th Virginia Regiment on February 13, 1776. The 5th Virginia was raised in the counties around Richmond and originally based in Williamsburg, where Crawford joined the regiment to participate in training of the recruits. Later that year, Crawford was promoted to Colonel of the 7th Virginia Regiment to fill a vacancy when Colonel William Daingerfield resigned his command of that unit.

A number of histories incorrectly state that Crawford raised the 7th Virginia Regiment near Fort Pitt at the beginning of the revolution. The 7th Virginia initially was raised in southeastern Virginia near Gloucester Court House. The confusion may be due to Crawford&#x27;s role in raising another regiment near Fort Pitt, the 13th Virginia, which was redesignated the 9th Virginia in 1778 and later renumbered to the 7th Virginia in 1781 while it was stationed at Fort Pitt. Crawford commanded the 13th Virginia for a time in 1777.

Many histories also inaccurately state that Crawford led the 7th Virginia at the Battle of Long Island and the following retreat across New Jersey. Crawford&#x27;s own words contradict this viewpoint in a letter written to George Washington from Williamsburg, VA on September 20, 1776: &quot;&quot;I Should have com to new York with those Reget ordred their but the Regt I belong to is Ordred to this place.&quot; Regimental histories of the 7th Virginia along with other historical references also reveal that the 7th Virginia did not participate in the battle of Long Island. Similar uncertainty surrounds narratives that state Crawford was with Washington at the crossing of the Delaware and the Battles of Trenton and Princeton. Recent historians have sought to correct these inaccuracies, such as H. Ward in his biography of Revolutionary soldiers from Virginia: &quot;It is disputed whether Crawford served in any part of the New York-New Jersey campaigns of 1776-1777…&quot; 

Crawford apparently left the command of the 7th Virginia in November 1776. A farewell letter to Crawford from the officers of the 7th Virginia was published in the Virginia Gazette newspaper on November 22, 1776. He responded with a letter of his own in the same edition of the Gazette, bidding farewell to the 7th Virginia. 

He returned to his home on the frontier late in 1776 and was actively engaged in raising the 13th Virginia Regiment, which was authorized by Congress in September 1776 with recruiting beginning in December 1776 in the District of West Augusta of Virginia (this region was claimed by Virginia and encompassed parts of present day western Pennsylvania and West Virginia). Crawford wrote to Washington from Fredricktown Maryland on February 12, 1777, to inform him he was coming from the frontier, where the officers of the regiment already had recruited about 500 men. He was on his way to Congress to seek funding for arms and supplies and then planned to immediately return home. The Continental Congress resolved on February 17, 1777: &quot;That 20,000 dollars be paid to Colonel William Crawford for raising and equipping the regiment under his command, part of the Virginia new levies&quot;.&quot; 

The 13th Virginia, or West Augusta regiment, was raised on the condition that it remain in the West in the event of an Indian War. However, with Washington&#x27;s need for reinforcements in the East, the Continental Congress on January 8, 1777, requested the governor of Virginia to order the West Augusta regiment to join Washington in New Jersey. But with increased attacks on frontier settlements by Native Americans allied with the British in early 1777, a Council of War was held at Fort Pitt on March 24, 1777, that decided the 13th Virginia should not be deployed to the East at that time. Crawford wrote to Congress on April 22, 1777: &quot;&quot;Honorable Sir—Having received orders to join his Excellency General Washington in the Jerseys with the battalion now under my command, which orders I would willingly have obeyed, had not a council of war held at this place (proceedings of which were transmitted to Congress by express) resolve that I should remain here until further orders&quot;.&quot; However, Colonel William Russell was now commander of the 13th Virginia and on June 9, 1777 a detachment of the regiment under Major Charles Simms marched eastward to Philadelphia. Colonel Russell apparently led another detachment of the 13th Virginia eastward in July after he was inoculated for smallpox. Likewise, Crawford may have brought a number of recruits with him when he joined Washington in July or August 1777.

During the Philadelphia campaign, Crawford was placed in command of a scouting detachment as part of the light infantry corps for Washington&#x27;s army. General William Maxwell commanded the light infantry and Crawford was selected to serve as one of the field officers under Maxwell. William Walker, a member of the light infantry, described Crawford in the typical attire of a frontier rifleman: &quot;&quot;…Colonel Crawford with his leather hunting shirt, pantaloons and Rifle…&quot; The British forces, after landing near Head of Elk, Maryland, approached Philadelphia from the south through Delaware. Washington sent Maxwell&#x27;s Light Infantry to delay the British march along the main road to Wilmington at a crossing of the Christiana Creek known as Cooch&#x27;s Bridge. On September 3, 1777, the fighting was intense between Maxwell&#x27;s light infantry and the British vanguard, as John Chilton of the 3rd Virginia Regiment recorded in his Diary: &quot;3d Septr. - The enemy advanced as high as the red Lion, they were met with by our advanced party under Colo Crawford – the engagement was pretty hot. several on each side was wounded and some slain&quot;.&quot; Being outnumbered and outgunned, the light infantry was driven from Cooch&#x27;s Bridge and fell back to the main American lines near Wilmington, Delaware.

Crawford continued to serve in the light infantry corps at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. On October 11, 1777, militia units from the Virginia counties of Prince William, Culpepper, Loudoun, and Berkley were formed into a brigade and placed under Crawford&#x27;s command. However, as the war on the western frontier intensified late in 1777, Crawford was transferred to the Western Department of the Continental Army. On November 20, 1777, Congress requested that Washington &quot;&quot;send Col. Wm. Crawford to Pittsburg to take command, under Brig. Gen. Hand, of the Continental troops and militia in the Western Department&quot;.&quot; He served at Fort Pitt under Generals Edward Hand and Lachlan McIntosh. Crawford was present at the Treaty of Fort Pitt in 1778, and helped to build Fort Laurens and Fort McIntosh that year. Resources were scarce on the frontier, however, and Fort Laurens was abandoned in 1779. In 1780, Crawford visited Congress to appeal for more funds for the western frontier. In 1781, he retired from military service.

==Crawford Expedition==
In 1782, General William Irvine persuaded Crawford to lead an expedition against enemy Native American villages along the Sandusky River. Before leaving, on May 16 he made out his will and testament. His son John Crawford, his son-in-law William Harrison, and his nephew and namesake William Crawford also joined the expedition.

Crawford led about 500 volunteers deep into American Indian territory with the hope of surprising them. However, the Indians and their British allies at Detroit had learned about the expedition in advance, and brought about 440 men to the Sandusky to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting, the Americans found themselves surrounded. During a confused retreat, Crawford and dozens of his men were captured. The Delaware Nation tribes tortured and executed many of the men in retaliation for the Gnadenhutten massacre earlier in the year, in which 96 peaceful Christian Indian men, women, and children had been murdered by Pennsylvanian militiamen. Crawford&#x27;s execution was brutal, and was overseen by Simon Girty, a former soldier under Crawford&#x27;s command who deserted his post after being wanted for high treason in 1778 for acting as an enemy of the state while serving in the militia (the order was signed by Timothy Matlack, and George Bryan). Crawford was tortured for at least two hours before he was burned at the stake. His nephew and son-in-law were also captured and executed. The war ended shortly thereafter, but Crawford&#x27;s horrific execution was widely publicized in the United States, worsening the already strained relationship between Native Americans and European Americans.

==Legacy==

In 1982, the site of Colonel Crawford&#x27;s execution was added to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1877, the Pioneer Association of Wyandot County erected an 8.5 ft (2.6 m) Berea sandstone monument near the site. The Ohio Historical Society also has an historical marker nearby.

Crawford County, Ohio, Crawford County, Pennsylvania, Crawford County, Michigan, and Crawford County, Indiana, are named for William Crawford. So too is Colonel Crawford High School in North Robinson, Ohio.

There is a replica of Crawford&#x27;s cabin in Connellsville, Pennsylvania.

Crawford&#x27;s half-brother, James Stevenson, was a member of the Pennsylvania State Senate.

<text>In baseball, a catch occurs when a fielder gains secure possession of a batted ball before it bounces, and maintains possession until they voluntarily or intentionally release the ball. When a catch occurs, the batter is out (said to have &quot;flied out&quot;), and runners are in jeopardy of being put out if any fielder with possession of the ball reaches their starting base before they do.

Unlike in American football and other sports, neither secure possession for a time nor for a number of steps is enough to demonstrate that a catch has occurred. A fielder may, for example, appear to catch and hold a batted ball securely, take a few more steps, collide with a wall or another player, and drop the ball. This is not a catch.

Umpires signal a catch with the out signal: a fist raised into the air, often with a hammering motion; if there is doubt about it, the umpire will likely shout &quot;That&#x27;s a catch!&quot; On a close no-catch, the umpire will signal with the safe signal, which is both arms swept to the side and extended, accompanied by the call &quot;&quot;No&quot; catch, &quot;no&quot; catch!&quot; with an emphasis on the word &quot;no&quot;.

To avoid ambiguity with the common term &quot;catch&quot; meaning any action that gains possession of a ball, some may say that a fielder gloved a thrown or batted, bouncing ball.

==Illegal catches==
The fielder must catch the ball with their hand or glove. If the fielder uses their cap, protector, pocket or any other part of their uniform in getting possession, it is not a catch. Therefore, a foul ball which directly becomes lodged in the equipment of the catcher (other than their glove) is not considered a catch and hence not a foul tip.

It is not a catch if the batted ball hits a fielder, then hits a member of the offensive team or an umpire, and then is caught by another defensive player.

A catch is legal if the ball is finally held by any fielder before it touches the ground. Runners may leave their bases the instant the first fielder touches the ball. A fielder may reach over a fence, a railing, a rope, or a line of demarcation to make a catch. They may jump on top of a railing or a canvas that may be in foul ground. Interference should not be called in cases where a spectator comes into contact with a fielder and a catch is not made if the fielder reaches over a fence, a railing, a rope. The fielder does so at their own risk.

If a fielder, attempting a catch at the edge of the dugout, is &quot;held up&quot; and kept from an apparent fall by a player or players of either team and the catch is made, it shall be allowed.

<doc id="1092454" wikidata="Q458982" url="?curid=1092454" title="Malazan Book of the Fallen">
<text>Malazan Book of the Fallen is a series of epic fantasy novels written by the Canadian author Steven Erikson. The series, published by Bantam Books in the U.K. and Tor Books in the U.S., consists of ten volumes, beginning with &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; (1999) and concluding with &quot;The Crippled God&quot; (2011). Erikson&#x27;s series presents the narratives of a large cast of characters spanning thousands of years across multiple continents.

His stories present complicated series of events in the world upon which the Malazan Empire is located. Each of the first five novels is relatively self-contained, in that each resolves its respective primary conflict; however, many underlying characters and events are interwoven throughout the works of the series, binding it together. The Malazan world was co-created by Steven Erikson and Ian Cameron Esslemont in the early 1980s as a backdrop to their GURPS roleplaying campaign. In 2004, Esslemont began publishing his own series of six novels set in the same world, beginning with &quot;Night of Knives&quot;. Although Esslemont&#x27;s books are published under a different series title – &quot;Novels of the Malazan Empire&quot; – Esslemont and Erikson collaborated on the storyline for the entire sixteen-book project and Esslemont&#x27;s novels are considered to be as canonical and integral to the series&#x27; mythos as Erikson&#x27;s own.

The series has received widespread critical acclaim, with reviewers praising the epic scope, plot complexity and characterizations, and fellow authors such as Glen Cook (&quot;The Black Company&quot;) and Stephen R. Donaldson (&quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant&quot;) hailing it as a masterwork of the imagination, and comparing Erikson to the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

==Books==

=== List ===
Erikson and Esslemont recommend reading the books in order of publication. &quot;Tor.com&quot; published a reading order based on the approximate chronological order of events in the series, which the authors did not consider suitable as a reading order for a first-time reader.
===Malazan Book of the Fallen===
This is the main series, written by Steven Erikson, and commenced, in terms of publication order, before any of the other series. This first novel, &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;, was shortlisted for a World Fantasy Award. The second novel, &quot;Deadhouse Gates&quot;, was voted one of the ten best fantasy novels of 2000 by SF Site. See the structure section below for more information.
===The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach===
The first three novellas were published together as &quot;The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, Volume 1&quot;. &quot;The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach, Volume 2&quot; includes the second three novellas. 
* &quot;Blood Follows&quot; (2002)
* &quot;The Healthy Dead&quot; (2004)
* &quot;The Lees of Laughter&#x27;s End&quot; (2007)
*&quot;Crack&#x27;d Pot Trail&quot; (2009)
*&quot;The Wurms of Blearmouth&quot; (2012)

*&quot;Upon a Dark of Evil Overlords&quot; (2020)
*&quot;Time&#x27;s Cursed Cartwheel&quot; (TBA)

===Novels of the Malazan Empire===
Novels of the Malazan Empire is a six-part novel series written by Ian Cameron Esslemont. The novels cover events simultaneous with the Book of the Fallen, like the mystery of the Crimson Guard, the succession of the Malazan Empire, the situation on Korel and Jacuruku and the mystery of Assail.

===The Kharkanas Trilogy===
The Kharkanas Trilogy is a prequel series written by Steven Erikson after the completion of the main series. The series deals with the Tiste before their split into darkness, light and shadow. It sheds light on the events that are often hinted at in the background of &quot;Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot;. Many of the important Tiste characters from the &quot;Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot; make an appearance like Anomander Rake, Draconus, Spinnock Durav and Andarist.

=== Path to Ascendancy ===
The Path to Ascendancy is a prequel series set in the world of Malazan, written by Ian Cameron Esslemont. The stories deal with the early adventures of Dancer and Kellanved (Dorin and Wu, in this series) and their eventual rise to power on Quon Tali.

===Witness===
Witness is a series written by Steven Erikson as a sequel to the main series featuring Karsa Orlong and his quest to destroy civilization.

In July 2024, Erikson stated that the series would now be four novels instead of the planned trilogy, as the second novel needed to be split in two.

==Conception==
The Malazan world was originally created by Steven Erikson and Ian Cameron Esslemont in 1982 as a backdrop for role-playing games using a modified version of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. By 1986, when the GURPS system had been adopted by Erikson and Esslemont, the world had become much larger and more complex, approaching its current scope. It was then developed into a movie script entitled &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;. When this was not successful in finding interest, the two writers agreed to each write a series set in their shared world. Steven Erikson wrote &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot; as a novel in the period 1991-92 but it was not published until 1999. In the meantime, he wrote several non-fantasy novels. When he sold &quot;Gardens of the Moon&quot;, he agreed to a contract for an additional nine volumes in the series. The contract with Bantam UK was worth £675,000 making it &quot;among the largest fees ever paid for a fantasy series&quot;.

Ian Cameron Esslemont wrote the Novels series from 2004 to 2014.

After finishing the two main series, Erikson and Esslemont continued on to further projects in the Malazan universe. While writing the last novels in &quot;The Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot;, Erikson decided that his next project, &quot;The Kharkanas Trilogy&quot;, would be a &quot;trilogy traditional in form,&quot; saying the following: &quot;If the Malazan series emphasized a postmodern critique of the subgenre of epic fantasy, paying subtle homage all the while, the Kharkanas Trilogy subsumes the critical aspects and focuses instead on the homage.&quot;

At one point, Steven Erikson indicated that the two authors would collaborate on &quot;The Encyclopedia Malaz&quot;, an extensive guide to the series, which was to be published following the last novel in the main sequence. In an interview on a later date, however, he mentioned talks underway with an RPG 20D group to produce a game adapted from the Malazan universe, in which case the maps and notes created by Erikson and Esslemont would be released through installments or expansions rather than through the publishing of an encyclopedia.

The Malazan world has no official unified name, although Steven Erikson has jokingly called it Wu.

In an interview with a Spanish fantasy blog, Erikson said that the hand-drawn version of the Malazan world which he had at home was too large to be photocopied; however, he also said that the maps created by fans were coming close.

==Influences==

In a general review of &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Fantasy Literature&quot;, edited by Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn, Erikson fired a shot across the bow of &quot;the state of scholarship in the fantastic as it pertains to epic fantasy,&quot; taking particularly to task James&#x27;s opening lines in Chapter 5 of that volume. Erikson uses a handful of words from that chapter as an epigraph for a quasi-autobiographical essay in &quot;The New York Review of Science Fiction&quot;. James&#x27;s sentences read in full:

Erikson writes, &quot;But epic fantasy has moved on, something critics have failed to notice.&quot; He goes on,

Erikson concludes, &quot;So, Professor James, when you say &#x27;since [Tolkien and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;]... most subsequent writers of fantasy are either imitating him or else desperately trying to escape his influence&#x27;—sorry. You&#x27;re flat-out wrong.&quot;

==Themes==
The Malazan series contains many themes around socio-economic inequality and social injustice throughout such as gender equality with Erikson stating &quot;It occurred to us that it would create a culture without gender bias so there would be no gender-based hierarchies of power. It became a world without sexism and that was very interesting to explore.&quot; as well as the inevitability of and role of art in civilizational collapse and many other themes rooted in a postmodernist and post-structuralist deconstruction of the fantasy genre and magical realism.

==Critical reception==
The series was positively received by critics, who praised the epic scope, plot complexity and the introspective nature of the characterization, which serve as social commentary. Fellow author Glen Cook has called the series a masterwork of the imagination that may be the high water mark of the epic fantasy genre. In his treatise written for The New York Review of Science Fiction, fellow author Stephen R. Donaldson has also praised Erikson for his approach to the fantasy genre, the subversion of classical tropes, the complex characterizations, the social commentary — pointing explicitly to parallels between the fictional Letheras Economy and the US Economy — and has compared him to the likes of Joseph Conrad, Henry James, William Faulkner, and Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Reviewing for SF Site, Dominic Cilli says, &quot;The Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot; raises &quot;the bar for fantasy literature&quot;, that the world building and the writing are exceptional. Cilli claims the series is written for the &quot;most advanced readers out there.&quot;, going on to state that &quot;Even they will have to make two passes through all ten books to fully comprehend the myriad of plotlines, characters and various settings that Erickson presents to us.&quot; Reading Erikson&#x27;s &quot;The Malazan Book of the Fallen&quot; might be &quot;the most challenging literary trial&quot; a reader has ever tried, yet &quot;the payoff is too enormous to ignore and well worth taking on the endeavor. Steven Erikson doesn&#x27;t spoon feed his readers. He forces you to question and think on a level that very few authors would even dare for fear of finding and perhaps losing an audience.&quot;

<text>Loris Stecca (born 30 March 1960) is an Italian former world champion boxer. He is the older brother of former featherweight world champion of boxing, Maurizio Stecca.

==Professional career==
Stecca held the WBA super bantamweight title for three months in 1984. He defeated Leo Cruz to win the title by twelfth round knockout, then lost it to Victor Callejas by a knockout in round eight at Mario Morales coliseum, then known as Mets Pavilion, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico.

Stecca won five fights in a row, all by knockout, putting himself on title contention once again. In a rematch with Callejas, held in November 1985 in Rimini, Italy, however, he lost by a sixth round knockout. Ahead on the scorecards, Stecca received a punch that lifted him off the floor, sending him to the air before he landed on his knees. He got up, but his corner soon stopped the fight, and the punch made the highlights of many sports news shows.

== Amateur career ==
Stecca was the 1979 Italian Featherweight Champion.

==Attempted murder==
Stecca was sentenced on 2 June 2015 to eight years in jail for the attempted murder of business partner Roberta Cester who was allegedly stabbed by the former world champion boxer during a 2013 gym confrontation.

<text>&quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear&quot;, sometimes rendered as &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot;, is an 1849 poem and Christmas carol written by Edmund Sears, pastor of the Unitarian Church in Wayland, Massachusetts. In 1850, Sears&#x27; lyrics were set to &quot;Carol&quot;, a tune written for the poem the same year at his request, by Richard Storrs Willis. This pairing remains the most popular in the United States, while in Commonwealth countries, the lyrics are set to &quot;Noel&quot;, a later adaptation by Arthur Sullivan from an English melody.

== History ==

Edmund Sears composed the five-stanza poem in common metre doubled during 1849. It first appeared on December 29, 1849, in &quot;The Christian Register&quot; in Boston, Massachusetts.

Sears served the Unitarian congregation in Wayland, Massachusetts, before moving on to a larger congregation at First Church of Christ, Unitarian, in Lancaster, also known as The Bulfinch Church, for its design by Charles Bulfinch. After seven years, he suffered a breakdown and returned to Wayland. He wrote &quot;It Came Upon the Midnight Clear&quot; while serving as a part-time preacher in Wayland. Writing during a period of personal melancholy, and with news of revolution in Europe and the United States&#x27; war with Mexico fresh in his mind, Sears portrayed the world as dark, full of &quot;sin and strife&quot;, and not hearing the Christmas message.

Sears is said to have written these words at the request of his friend, William Parsons Lunt, pastor of United First Parish Church, Quincy, Massachusetts, for Lunt&#x27;s Sunday school. One account says the carol was first performed by parishioners gathered in Sears&#x27; home on Christmas Eve, but to what tune the carol was sung is unknown as Willis&#x27; familiar melody was not written until the following year.

According to Ken Sawyer, Sears&#x27; song is remarkable for its focus not on Bethlehem, but on his own time, and on the contemporary issue of war and peace. Written in 1849, it has long been assumed to be Sears&#x27; response to the just ended Mexican–American War. The song has been included in many of the Christmas albums recorded by numerous singers in the modern era.

== Melody ==

In 1850, Richard Storrs Willis, a composer who trained under Felix Mendelssohn, wrote the melody called &quot;Carol&quot;. This melody is most often set in the key of B-flat major in a 6/8 time signature. &quot;Carol&quot; is still the most widely known tune to the song in the United States.

In Commonwealth countries, the tune called &quot;Noel&quot;, which was adapted from an English melody in 1874 by Arthur Sullivan, is the usual accompaniment. This tune also appears as an alternative in &quot;The Hymnal 1982&quot;, the hymnal of the United States Episcopal Church.

<text>Schismatrix () is a science fiction novel by Bruce Sterling, originally published in 1985. The story was Sterling&#x27;s only novel-length treatment of the Shaper/Mechanist universe. Five short stories preceded the novel and are published together with it in a 1996 edition entitled &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot;. &quot;Schismatrix&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1985, and the British Science Fiction Award in 1986.

==Plot==
The main character, Abelard Lindsay, is born in the ancient lunar colony &quot;Mare Serenitatis Circumlunar Corporate Republic&quot;, into a family of aristocratic Mechanists, but after being sent to the Shaper&#x27;s Ring Council, he receives specialized and experimental diplomatic training and gives his loyalty to the Shapers&#x27; cause. He, his best friend and fellow Shaper protégé Philip Constantine, and the beautiful and passionate Preservationist Vera Kelland lead an insurgency against the rulers of the republic, who use Mechanist technology to prolong their lives. The three of them influence the younger generation towards the Shapers&#x27; cause in their pursuit of Preservationism, a movement devoted to the preservation of Earth-bound human culture. Kelland and Lindsay agree to kill themselves as a political statement, but Lindsay reneges on his suicide pact after Kelland is dead. Constantine attempts to kill Lindsay but instead kills a Mechanist, creating a scandal.

Constantine is allowed to remain in the Republic because his knowledge is needed to keep the Republic&#x27;s environment from self-destructing, but Lindsay is exiled to the &quot;Mare Tranquilitatis Circumlunar People&#x27;s Zaibatsu&quot;. This lunar colony, which collapsed due to an environmental crisis, has become a refuge for &quot;sundogs&quot;, criminals, dissidents and wanderers. There he meets Kitsune, a woman modified by the Shapers to be an ideal prostitute. Apparently a servant of the &quot;Geisha Bank&quot;, a powerful money center, she in fact rules the bank through the remotely operated body of her now brain-dead predecessor. In his months on the Zaibatsu, Lindsay uses his diplomatic talents to organize a complex fraud involving a fictitious theatrical event and befriends an old Mechanist, Fyodor Ryumin. However, eventually the fraud takes on a life of its own, and the new-formed &quot;Kabuki Intrasolar&quot; becomes a legitimate artistic and business venture. Lindsay cannot remain to enjoy the profits, though: Constantine has in the meantime overthrown the Corporate Republic&#x27;s government. Constantine has abandoned Preservationism to become a Shaper militant, and sends an assassin to present a stark choice: become Constantine&#x27;s pawn or be killed by the assassin. Lindsay manages to escape with a group of Mechanist pirates, in the process aiding Kitsune to take power of the Geisha Bank openly.

Lindsay joins a ship called the &quot;Red Consensus&quot;, which doubles as the nation-state of the &quot;Fortuna Miners&#x27; Democracy&quot;, after the failure of the previously independent asteroid mining Mechanist cartel. The FMD, financed by more wealthy Mechanists cartels, annexes the asteroid &quot;Esairs XII&quot;, home to the Mavrides family, a small shaper clan. Lindsay meets Nora Mavrides, a fellow diplomat. Nora informs Abelard that the subjects of the diplomatic training are in disgrace due to the high incidence of treason and defection from their ranks. The two of them work to promote peaceful coexistence between the Shaper militants and the Mechanist pirates, but after several months of conflict, espionage, murders and sabotages, open fighting breaks out. Mavrides and Lindsay, now lovers, eventually murder their companions to save one another. Before the asteroid&#x27;s life-support systems shut down after the battle, the alien &quot;Investors&quot; arrive.

Peace finally comes to the Schismatrix after the aliens arrive. The alien Investors are obsessed with trade and wealth, and at first encourage humanity to focus on business instead of war. Trade flourishes and the Shapers and Mechanists put their differences aside. Lindsay and Mavrides become powerful Shaper leaders, thanks to their early contact with the Investors. The &quot;Investor Peace&quot; does not last forever, though, and tensions between Shapers and Mechanists eventually start to rise when the Investors play the factions against one another. Ultimately Philip Constantine rises to power and takes control of the Ring Council, ousting Mavride&#x27;s and Lindsay&#x27;s pro-détente faction. Lindsay runs away from what he sees as a hopeless battle, but Nora decides to stay in the Rings, where they had built their lives and family, to fight Constantine and his militant government.

Lindsay escapes to the Mechanist cartels in the asteroid belt, where Kitsune has again secretly taken power. There Lindsay works ceaselessly for decades to bring about the détente he believes will reunite him with Mavrides. Using a recording of an Investor&#x27;s ship queen involved in some taboo activities to blackmail the alien, Lindsay contributes to the creation of Czarina-Kluster, neither Shaper nor Mechanist, which quickly becomes one of the richest and most powerful states in the solar system. Lindsay&#x27;s partner, Wellspring, plans to use the colony to promote his post-humanist ideology, while Lindsay himself seeks to bring Nora to the new colony. However, Constantine discovers Mavride&#x27;s plan to defect and forces her to kill herself. Consumed with hatred, Lindsay for the first time confronts his former friend directly, arranging a duel with him using an ancient alien artifact called the Arena. While Lindsay wins, the Arena leaves both him and Constantine catatonic.

Years after the duel, Lindsay wakes up on his old home, now renamed the &quot;Neotenic Cultural Republic&quot;. Constantine&#x27;s militant Shaperism has been replaced by a Preservationist government, dedicated to remaining a cultural preserve where normal, unmodified human life is preserved. As part of the treatment that restored Lindsay&#x27;s mind, his original Shaper diplomatic training has been removed. Having returned to a Preservationist world, and now restored to a fully human state, Lindsay decides to break with his past and embrace new dreams. He becomes a post-humanist and returns to Czarina-Kluster to work with Wellspring&#x27;s &#x27;Lifesiders&#x27; clique.

In the years during Lindsays&#x27; catatonia, the expansion of settlements throughout the Solar System has seen an economy in huge surplus; with abundant wealth, expensive and prolonged terraforming efforts are first being considered. While Wellspring seeks to terraform Mars, Lindsay attempts to create an abyssal ecology on Europa. Constantine&#x27;s Shaper family has been disgraced by Constantine&#x27;s defeat, and Lindsay manages to convert them to his cause, even Constantine&#x27;s &quot;daughter&quot; Vera (created from DNA taken from Vera Kelland decades before). As time goes on, eventually Czarina-Kluster, in its turn, faces social collapse. With his Lifesiders faction&#x27;s research still in its infancy, Lindsay and Vera Constantine secretly break the Interdict and bring back samples of Earth&#x27;s abyssal life, providing the breakthroughs that make the Europa project a success.

As the Lifesiders transform themselves into fish-like forms capable of survival in Europa&#x27;s oceans, Lindsay visits the now-cured Philip Constantine. Constantine believes that Lindsay will never see Europa, that he will leave in the end rather than see his cause through to fruition, just as he always had. He also reveals that Vera Constantine&#x27;s DNA comes as much from Lindsay as Vera Kelland. Philip reconciles with Abelard, then commits suicide.

When Lindsay returns to Europa, he finds that Philip is right: he cannot bring himself to undergo the transformation. At that moment, an alien Presence, who had followed Vera Constantine since her mission in an alien embassy, reveals itself. The being explains that it has been devoted to exploring and exulting in the variety of experiences of the universe, and invites Lindsay to join it. Lindsay accepts and is transformed into a bodiless form, to explore the infinite mysteries of the universe for eternity.

==Characters==
* Abelard Malcolm Tyler Lindsay: Naturally born in a Mechanist society, Lindsay undergoes an experimental intensive Shaper diplomatic training that gives him an enhanced capability for manipulation and deception. His ambition and knack for self-preservation see him frequently play a pivotal role in the Schismatrix.
* Alexandrina: Lindsay&#x27;s first wife. An aristocratic Mechanist much older than he was.
* Kitsune: Head of the Geisha Bank. Becomes an entire ecosystem that consists entirely of her skin and body parts.
* Margaret Juliano: Shaper scientist, she pioneers the &#x27;Superbright&#x27; gene-line, with a natural intelligence far above even the shaper norm. The instability of the Superbrights brings suspicion on Juliano and Shaper gene-lines are limited to an IQ of 200.
* Nora Mavrides: Lindsay&#x27;s second wife. She believes deeply in the Shaper cause and chooses to fight the Mechanists when they begin to attack her state even when the situation is hopeless.
* Philip Khouri Constantine: Former friend of Lindsay. Becomes obsessed with obtaining power and tries to bring power to the Shapers through radical means.
* Vera Constantine: Shaper daughter of Philip Constantine, cloned from genetic material of Vera Kelland.
* Vera Kelland: Aristocrat who also trained with Lindsay and Constantine. She commits suicide in an attempt to defy the aristocratic Republic that she and Lindsay came from.

==Races ==
* Humanity: Though the Earth remains a human civilization, those that colonised the rest of the Solar System have used technology and genetic engineering to such a degree that they arguably have &#x27;evolved&#x27; into multiple new species.
* The Investors: Massive reptilian-esque aliens, interstellar traders who closely guard the secret of their starflight. Charge excessive fares for &#x27;humanity&#x27; to travel to other star systems to visit and study the nineteen known alien species.
* The Gasbags: intelligent spacefaring gas entities.

==Locations ==
Abelard Lindsays&#x27; travels in the book mirrors the expanding colonisation of the Solar System.
* Circumlunar Space Stations (Concatenates): a series of large Space Stations orbiting the Earth&#x27;s Moon. The most &quot;Earth like&quot; of the interstellar settlements, with arable land and strong gravity (likely centrifugal), these were mankind&#x27;s first permanent habitation outside of Earth. Ten exist in total, each named after the lunar area mined to construct them.
**Mare Serenitatis Circumlunar Corporate Republic a large space station named after the lunar feature Mare Serenitatis (the &quot;Sea of Serenity&quot;). Many references are made to the station&#x27;s fecundity; its principal industry was likely agriculture. Later renamed &quot;Neotenic Cultural Republic&quot;
**Mare Tranquilitatis People&#x27;s Circumlunar Zaibatsu a large space station named after the lunar feature Mare Tranquilitatis (the &quot;Sea of Tranquility&quot;). The station is in some disrepair; a proportion so badly affected by radiation it has been walled off. Its main industries are agriculture (oxygen farmers), pharmaceutical (the black medicals) and prostitution (the Geisha Bank). Its main currency is credit with the Geisha bank.
* Cirumsolar Asteroid Worlds: built in the Asteroid Belt, principally dominated by Mechanist factions.
** Dembowska Cartel: an entity ostensibly governed by Michael Carnassus, a revered pioneer of an alien embassy, the Cartel is controlled and monitored by &#x27;the Wallmother&#x27;, the character Kitsune who has abandoned human form for an ever-growing mass of flesh. The station becomes a centre of Investor knowledge when Abelard Lindsay begins publishing his &#x27;Journal&#x27;. Its principal industry is manufacturing (cryonics), fuelled by alien trade secrets gleaned from Carnassus.
** Czarina-Kluster People&#x27;s Corporate Republic The permanent residence of a disgraced Investor Queen, Czarina-Kluster is an ad hoc city-state of both Mechanist and Shaper construction.
** Esairs XII, a small asteroid inhabited by a Shaper task force, involved in mining and manufacturing.
* Ring Systems. Saturn&#x27;s Rings are dominated by the Shaper faction, governed by the Ring Council. In the beginning of the novel, the rings are under a Mechanist siege.
** Goldreich-Tremaine Council State Home of the Mavrides and Vetterling gene-lines, Goldreich-Tremaine flourishes during détente while the Shaper &#x27;military-academic&#x27; complex has a privileged relationship with the alien Investors.
** Skimmer&#x27;s Union Council State Based in orbit of Titan, the Skimmer&#x27;s Union mined the gas of Titan for organic gases.
*Europa: the colonization of Europa begins in earnest with the end of the novel &#x27;Schismatrix&#x27; - aquatic species based on those illegally retrieved from the Earth prepare the moon for inhabitation by posthuman &#x27;angels&#x27;, genetically engineered to survive Europa&#x27;s harsh conditions.
* Terraform-Kluster. Founded after the financial ruin of Czarina-Kluster, principally devoted to the project of terraforming Mars.

==Vocabulary==
*Shapers: Group that alters the body through genetic modification and specialized mental training. They originate from the colonies orbiting Jupiter and Saturn.
*Mechanists: Group that modifies bodies through computer software and external alterations. The Mechanists have been at war with the Shapers for decades, fighting over whose technology is more powerful and efficient. They originate from the asteroid belt&#x27;s colonies.
*Moondocks: A derisive nickname for the Circumlunar habitats which were the first centers of life in space. They are now considered obsolete relics.
*Schismatrix: the system that includes the entire Shaper/Mechanist universe. The term is first used when the advent of détente opens the possibility of the Shaper and Mechanist factions coexisting harmoniously; a splintered posthuman settlement of the Solar System.
*Sundog: A nomad, without strong group affiliation and the permanent residency it affords. The label probably arose as the circumsolar asteroid belt would be the main territory inhabited by these itinerants. Criminals, Refugees, political exiles and the disadvantaged would adopt this lifestyle out of necessity, criminals may prefer its anonymity.
*Wirehead: A person who ignores or has abandoned his physical body in favor of permanent virtual reality.
*Lobster: A mechanist faction which permanently installs their bodies into spacesuits so that they can live in the vacuum of space.
*Looks: A language of facial expressions. To an untrained observer, they appear to be an endless series of sidelong glances.
*Geneline: A political family structure used by Shapers. Genelines trade genetic material, power, money and influence with one another as part of the subtle interplay of Shaper politics.
*Unplanned: A Shaper epithet for humans born naturally. Typically, such beings are unmodified genetically—but all such people are considered inferior.
*Cicada: A person from the Czarina-Kluster

==Ideologies==
*Preservationism: Contends that technology is destroying the essence of humanity. Places strict limits on anti-human technologies, advocates study of human art and history, and even for some the end of the Interdict with Earth.
*Détente: Belief that in the face of alien contact that humanity should present a united front. Followers of détente called for increased cooperation and contact between Shapers and Mechanists. Détente ended with renewed war and the rise of the Cataclysts.
*Militarism: Dogmatic loyalty to one&#x27;s own faction, that underlies the cold war between the Shapers and Mechanists. Outright warfare is rare, as the fragility of life-supporting environments in the Solar System makes mechanized warfare an exercise in mutually assured destruction. Instead, economic warfare, political rivalry and espionage are the more socially acceptable forms of conflict.
*Cataclysm: This ideology was first promulgated by the Superbrights. It demanded an end to artificial social controls and destruction of authority. Eventually devolved into terrorism and resulted in lingering animosity towards the Superbrights.
*Zen Serotonin: A cult that uses biofeedback (principally neurochemical-deploying biomonitors and sleep-monitoring beds) to maintain zen-like calm and detachment. The &quot;Nonmovement&quot; (as it is sometimes called) looks to slow the process of societal change, and has a strong focus on social order.
*Galacticism: A belief that mere loyalty to species was obsolete, and worked for faster than light technologies, interstellar colonization and increased contact with aliens. While not inherently militant, the resources required to pursue these goals demanded major faction support and so indirectly increased militarism as Shaper and Mechanist Galacticists competed with one another.
*Post-Humanism: Post-humanists believe in Prigoginic Levels of Complexity and its surrounding philosophy and science. Sterling only hints at many of the tenets of post-humanism, but a key goal of post-humanists is terraforming, which they consider to be a primal duty of intelligent beings. Post-humanists are supporters of détente. Wellspring is a key ideologue for the post-humanist philosophy.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Schismatrix&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #77, and stated that &quot;Besides being highly exciting and crammed with ingenious ideas, &quot;Schismatrix&quot; paints a moving Big Picture of humanity getting a grip on its own evolution. Lindsay, however unheroically, helps nudge it the right way. Excellent sense-of-wonder stuff.&quot;

J. Michael Caparula reviewed &quot;Schismatrix&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 80. Caparula described it as &quot;a jolting, kaleidoscopic space saga that O.D.&#x27;s on imagination&quot;.
==Schismatrix Plus==
Additional short stories set in the Shaper/Mechanist universe were originally collected in the 1989 short story collection &quot;Crystal Express&quot;, and republished with &quot;Schismatrix&quot; as &quot;Schismatrix Plus&quot; (1995) with a new introduction, &quot;The Circumsolar Frolics&quot;:
* &quot;Swarm&quot; (1982; set in 2248) – Shaper Captain Simon Afriel joins a fellow researcher in an interstellar embassy, an asteroid belt inhabited by colonies of insect-like aliens. Afriel also briefly appears in &quot;Twenty Evocations&quot; and in &quot;Schismatrix&quot;. This was Sterling&#x27;s first published story.
* &quot;Spider Rose&quot; (1982; set in 2283) – An ancient Mechanist from the fringes of the solar system buys something new from the Investors: a pet. Spider Rose herself appears very briefly during happier times in Schismatrix.
* &quot;Cicada Queen&quot; (1983; set in 2354) – A Shaper named Landau comes of age politically inside Czarina-Kluster, a habitat independent of faction where backroom deals and social cliques dominate, and whose stability is becoming increasingly fragile. Wellspring, a visionary rogue Mechanist and leading proponent of the post-humanist philosophy, is Landau&#x27;s mentor. &quot;Schismatrix&quot; later expands on the background of both Wellspring and C-K, which he helped found.
* &quot;Sunken Gardens&quot; (1984; set in 2554) – Individuals from various factions compete in a test of terraforming skills in a crater on the Martian surface. This story expands on the influence and power of Terraform-Kluster and its leader, the enigmatic Lobster King (who first appears in &quot;Cicada Queen&quot;).
* &quot;Twenty Evocations&quot; (1984; originally published as &quot;Life in the Shaper/Mechanist Era: Twenty Evocations&quot;; set around 2220–2400) – An experimental story built of fragments from the life of a Shaper named Nikolai Leng.

<text>Petroșani (; Hungarian: &quot;Petrozsény&quot;; German: &quot;Petroschen&quot;) is a city in Hunedoara County, Transylvania, Romania, with a population of 31,044 as of 2021. The city has been associated with mining since the 19th century.

==History==
&quot;Pietros&quot; means &quot;stony, rocky&quot; in Romanian. The city of Petroșani was founded in the 17th century (around 1640) with the name Petrozsény. In 1720, an Austrian cartographer mentions that the entire Jiu Valley was intensely populated and settlements could be seen from one end to the other.

At the 1818 census, Petroșani had 233 inhabitants, while the entire Valley counted 2,550. During this time, the main activity of the people was shepherding and no urban settlement had appeared yet. Around 1840, coal surface mining began in Petroșani, Vulcan, and Petrila.

After Romania joined the Allies of World War I in 1916, Romanian troops attacked the town during the Battle of Transylvania. A battalion of miners defended Petroșani in a last stand battle, refusing to give up the town. The Romanian occupation, however, did not last long: the united Austro-Hungarian and German troops regained control of the town shortly, in which guerrilla warfare, led by the local Viktor Maderspach, played an important role.

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of Petroșani in December 1918, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The town officially became part of the territory ceded to the Kingdom of Romania in June 1920 under the terms of the Treaty of Trianon. During the interwar period, the city was the headquarters of plasa Petroșani, within Hunedoara County. After 1950, the city became the headquarters of Petroșani raion within . Following the administrative reform of 1968, Petroșani became once more part of Hunedoara County.

The population experienced massive growth only in the 20th century during the communist government, as many workers were brought in from other parts of the country.

As other cities from the Jiu Valley, throughout the second half of the 19th century and most of the 20th century, most activities in the city revolved around the mines. But after the fall of the communist regime, many mines were closed, and the city, just like the whole valley, was forced to diversify the economy. This has also led to a significant population decline: Petroșani is one of the Romanian cities which has experienced the fastest population loss from the 1990s onwards.

==Geography==

Petroșani is located in the Jiu Valley, which is the entrance to the Retezat National Park and provides access to the Vâlcan, Parâng, and Retezat mountains.

<doc id="1092500" wikidata="Q795993" url="?curid=1092500" title="BIOS parameter block">
<text>In computing, the BIOS parameter block, often shortened to BPB, is a data structure in the volume boot record (VBR) describing the physical layout of a data storage volume. On partitioned devices, such as hard disks, the BPB describes the volume partition, whereas, on unpartitioned devices, such as floppy disks, it describes the entire medium. A basic BPB can appear and be used on any partition, including floppy disks where its presence is often necessary; however, certain filesystems also make use of it in describing basic filesystem structures. Filesystems making use of a BIOS parameter block include FAT12 (except for in DOS 1.x), FAT16, FAT32, HPFS, and NTFS. Due to different types of fields and the amount of data they contain, the length of the BPB is different for FAT16, FAT32, and NTFS boot sectors. (A detailed discussion of the various FAT BPB versions and their entries can be found in the FAT article.) Combined with the 11-byte data structure at the very start of volume boot records immediately preceding the BPB or EBPB, this is also called FDC descriptor or extended FDC descriptor in ECMA-107 or ISO/IEC 9293 (which describes FAT as for flexible/floppy and optical disk cartridges).

==References==
== Further reading ==
* — a description of BPBs, from version 2.0 to version 7.0
* — In the &quot;processing the BIOS parameter block&quot; section the authors describe the evolution of the BIOS parameter block from the MS-DOS version 2.0 BPB to the PC DOS version 4.0 BPB, and label each field with the DOS version that introduced it.
* — Figure 4.3 contains a diagram of the version 4.0 BPB and states that the layout of BPBs &quot;is not defined by Microsoft and can vary with different vendors&quot;. At the time that the book was written, this was true. Microsoft first publicly documented the BPB structure in the OS/2 Developers&#x27; Toolkit.
* — Verstak reverse engineers the BIOS parameter block. The paper contains several errors. One such is its statement that &quot;the presence of the EBPB in FAT32 is not documented by Microsoft&quot;. See:
** — Microsoft documents a version 4.0 BPB and a new &quot;FAT32 BIOS Parameter Block (BPB)&quot; (a version 7.0 BPB) for DOS-Windows 98 that is &quot;larger than a standard BPB&quot;, has an &quot;identical structure to a standard BPB&quot;, but that also &quot;includes several extra fields&quot;.
** — Microsoft documents extended BPBs on both FAT16 and FAT32 volumes. It also documents BPBs on NTFS volumes.
* — The table &quot;BPB and Extended BPB Fields on NTFS Volumes&quot; describes BPBs on NTFS volumes. The descriptions of several fields contradict those given in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.

<doc id="1092507" wikidata="Q2662430" url="?curid=1092507" title="Offices in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth">
<text>This article discusses the organizational and administrative structure of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was a confederative mixed monarchy of the period 1569–1795, comprising the Kingdom of Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and their fiefs. The Commonwealth was governed by the Parliament (Sejm) consisting of the King, the King-appointed Senate (Voivodes, Castellans, Ministers, Bishops) and the rest of hereditary nobility either in person or through the Sejm proper (consisting of deputies representing their lands). The nobility&#x27;s constitutional domination of the state made the King very weak and the commoners (burgesses and peasants) almost entirely unrepresented in the Commonwealth&#x27;s political system.

== Central offices ==

=== State offices ===
The division between public and court offices in the realities of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth is unclear, as all central offices originated from court positions. Some of them gained full autonomy, while others continued to perform service functions for the ruler. The state and court hierarchies overlapped, and the officials&#x27; competencies were not clearly defined. After 1565, the principle of &quot;incompatibilitas&quot; (&quot;incompatibility&quot;) forbade Voivodes and Castellans to hold a second title as a Minister, except for the post of Hetman.

The system of offices in the Commonwealth was the result of equalizing the administrative hierarchies of both constituent parts of the state: the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Lithuania had its own separate court tradition, but after drawing closer to Poland at the end of the 14th century, there was a trend of copying Polish models and creating offices analogous to those existing in Poland. This process culminated in the acts of the Union of Lublin, but it continued in practice until the 18th century as part of the so-called &quot;coequation of laws&quot;. However, the direction of influence was sometimes reversed, such as in the case of the office of the court huntsman, which appeared in Poland later than in Lithuania.

Essentially, almost every central office was dual, one for Poland and the other for Lithuania. This was reflected in the title, to which an appropriate adjective was added: &quot;Crown&quot; or &quot;Lithuanian&quot;. Thus, in the Commonwealth, there were two Grand Marshals: the Crown Grand Marshal and the Lithuanian Grand Marshal.

Both the Chancellor and the Sub-Chancellor stood at the head of the chancelleries (‘greater’ and ‘lesser’), which were headed by Regents. Each chancellery employed a number of professionals: secretaries, scribes and clerks. Outside the chancellery were the Metricants, in charge of keeping the Metrics, i.e. the books in which all the documents arriving and departing from each chancellery were entered. There were four chancelleries, four Metricants and two Metrics (Crown and Lithuanian) in the whole of the Commonwealth. The Treasurers were also supported by a number of professional officials, the most important of whom were Treasury Scribes (two in the Crown, three in Lithuania). He was assisted in matters of coinage issuance by a Mincer. In addition, a number of other functionaries: dispensers, superintendents, tax collectors, customs officers and toll collectors.

===Court offices===
Originally, all central offices were simultaneously court offices. However, in the Kingdom of Poland, the concept of the Crown, representing the state itself, was distinguished relatively early from the person of the mortal monarch. Consequently, some offices lost their direct association with the monarch and his court, becoming state offices primarily responsible for state administration. This division was never complete, but there was a group of offices whose roles were essentially limited to serving the court and the monarch. Among them, we distinguish between offices of the court () and the court offices (). The court offices attended to the king&#x27;s service, while the offices of the court managed and administered the court as an institution. The court offices were further divided into the offices of the royal table and the representatives of royal majesty.

Most of these offices were of a purely honorary nature, their holders did not perform the functions associated with them, or if they did, they did so very rarely, mainly during rare grand royal ceremonies (coronations, weddings, homages etc.). Apart from the aforementioned offices, the court included a significantly larger group of people, both honorary courtiers and servants.
===Military offices===
The highest military officials were the Hetmans, they could not be removed. Until the beginning of the 18th century, hetmans were not paid for their services.
With the emergence of a standing army in the Crown in the early 16th century and the office of Hetman, a staff of military officials formed around him to assist him in his tasks. The most important among them was the Field Scribe, closely followed by the Grand Warden. Over time, the offices began to lose their professional character and became purely dignitaries, the earliest of which was the office of the Grand Oboźny, whose tasks were actually carried out by the Field Oboźny. Other offices were still truly military in the 17th century, only becoming solely dignitaries in the 18th century. The following list covers only military offices, apart from these there were a number of other posts which were not dignitaries and were usually filled by professionals, there was also a separate cadre of officers.
== Provincial offices ==

=== Voivodes and castellans ===
Of secular Senators, the foremost was the Castellan (&quot;Kasztelan&quot;) of Kraków. Other Castellans, however, were considered to be lesser dignitaries than the Voivodes.

The power of the Voivodes had declined since that title had been introduced about the 12th century; in the 17th century, however, they were still the highest regional dignitaries. They were the highest representatives of their Voivodeships to the &quot;Senat&quot;. They were the leaders of the Land Parliaments (&quot;Sejmiki Wojewódzkie&quot;, Voivodeship Sejmiks). They were in charge of assembling local nobility&#x27;s military forces in the event of a &quot;pospolite ruszenie&quot; (&quot;levée en masse&quot;). Each chose a Deputy Voivode, who was responsible for setting local prices and measures. Voivodes were chosen by the King, except for those of Połock Voivode and Vilnius Voivode, who were elected by (and from) the local nobility (but still had to be appointed by the King).

Except for the Castellan of Kraków Land (which has its seat in a privileged city, as the Commonwealth&#x27;s capital until 1596), Castellans were often considered subordinate to Voivodes. A Castellan was in charge of part of a Voivodeship (till the 15th century called a &quot;Castellany&quot;, and thereafter divided into provinces for Major Castellans and powiats for Minor Castellans).

=== Land offices ===
A 1611 Constitution (amended 1633 and 1635) prescribed many officials. Exceptions to the rule, however, were the rule; Sejm rules were treated as mere recommendations. Thus Bełz Voivodeship had only 4 of the 15 prescribed dignitaries; most northern voivodeships had about 5; and in Wołyń and Bracław Voivodeships the hierarchical order was almost reversed. Each province or district had its own set of officials—a list of provinces may be found in the article on provinces and geography of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

District officials were appointed by the King, with a few exceptions (local parliaments—&quot;sejmiki&quot;—chose Chamberlains, District Judges, Deputy District Judges, District Clerks, and in Lithuania also Standard-bearers and District Marshals). Chamberlains, except for the name, had nothing in common with the Court officials of the same name. They administered a court of law (the Chamberlain&#x27;s Court) which had jurisdiction over property disputes. The District Judge headed the District Court, which had jurisdiction over civil and some criminal matters involving local nobility.

The &quot;Starosta generalny&quot; (&quot;General Starosta&quot;) was the official in charge of a specific territory. The &quot;Starosta grodowy&quot; (&quot;City Starosta&quot;) was in charge of cities, while the &quot;Starosta niegrodowy&quot; (&quot;Non-City Starosta&quot;) was responsible for administration of the Crown lands. These were to be kept in good financial and military order. While in time these administrative responsibilities became smaller (as Kings gave away more and more land), the &quot;Starosta&quot; remained in charge of the City Courts (&quot;sądy grodzkie&quot;), which dealt with most criminal matters and had jurisdiction over all local and visiting nobility. They dealt with the most severe cases (killings, rapes, robberies) and were quite harsh (highway robbery was punishable with death), which generally made Poland a safer country than its neighbors. The &quot;Starosta&quot;s also held the &quot;power of the sword&quot;, which meant that they enforced the verdicts of all other courts. Non-City &quot;Starosta&quot;s had no juridical powers.

Standard-bearers carried the local banner during Royal ceremonies, and in war when local troops served in the Army. During war, &quot;Wojski&quot;s maintained order and security in their territories. In Lithuania, the responsibilities of &quot;Ciwun&quot;s were similar to those of non-city &quot;starosta&quot;s (elders). District marshals presided over local parliaments (in the &quot;Crown&quot;, District Marshals were chosen only for the duration of the parliament session, and so were much less powerful than those of Lithuania, who were chosen for life).

=== Castle offices ===
The most important official was the &quot;Starosta&quot;. He was supported by a Borough Substarosta (&quot;podstarości grodowy&quot;), Burgrave (&quot;Burgrabia&quot;), Notary (&quot;Notariusz&quot;) and Scriptor (&quot;Pisarz&quot;). The Borough Substarosta assisted the &quot;Starosta&quot; and in his absence acted in his name with all his powers. Lower city officials were the Borough Regent (&quot;rejent grodzki&quot;), Borough Notary (&quot;notariusz grodzki&quot;), Borough Scriptor (&quot;pisarz grodzki&quot;) and common clerks (&quot;subclerks&quot; — &quot;podpiskowie&quot;).

In the eastern territories bordering on Russia, from 1667, a &quot;Border Judge&quot; cooperated with Russian judges in cases involving parties from the two countries; his rulings were final.

Judges were chosen from among the local hereditary nobles and had little formal training; therefore the quality of the courts varied from judge to judge, and levels of corruption were high. Attorneys, on the other hand, were required to have professional training. Sometimes a court included an &quot;asesor&quot;, who assisted the judge and collected fines and fees. Prosecutors were extremely rare. &quot;Instygator&quot;s maintained order and security on court grounds, and a court runner (&quot;woźny&quot;) delivered summons.

* Pisarz grodzki – Borough Clerk

In 1717 the &quot;Numb Diet&quot; barred non-Roman Catholics from being elected Envoys (to the Parliament), and to any other land offices if there was another Roman Catholic contender. The rights of the &quot;Dissidents&quot;, as they were called, were reinstated in 1768, and in 1772 their representation in the Diet was limited to a statutory of two members. These rules were finally abolished in 1792 by the 3rd May Constitution.

==Town and village offices==
These offices were very stable, having evolved about the 13th century and lasting almost unchanged to the end of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The administrative system had come from Germany together with Magdeburg law.

Every city (without exception) had a Council and a Bench, the Council being the administrative branch and the Bench the judicial branch. A new Council was chosen by the old one whose term had expired. The Council was responsible for administration, law, privileges, security, finances, guild oversight, and the like. The Council chose the Mayor, and its members&#x27; decision was final—even the &quot;Starosta&quot; or Voivode could only listen to the Mayor&#x27;s swearing-in and could not refuse to give him his seal. The Council met daily in the larger cities, less often in smaller ones.

The Mayor headed the Council and controlled the executive branch. He was responsible for conciliation, the care of the poor, and maintaining order by suppressing alcohol abuse and games of chance. Second to the Mayor was the Council Clerk, who ran the City Chancellery. The City Clerk (&quot;Syndyk Miejski&quot;) collected city taxes and supervised the tax collectors. Security and order in the city were the responsibility of the &quot;Hutman&quot;. He also supervised the city jail and the keyman who unlocked and locked the city gates at dawn and dusk.

The &quot;Lonar&quot; was the city treasurer, who oversaw its finances. He supervised the officials who controlled marketplace scales to ensure fair trade. Large cities also had scores of less common officials, such as Pipemasters, responsible for pipes and wells; Fire Chiefs; and City Translators, who assisted foreigners and looked out for spies.

The Bench was chaired by a &quot;wójt&quot;. He and the other Bench members were chosen by the Council for a year&#x27;s term from among lesser city officials (writers, clerks, etc.).

City Chief Executioners executed not only criminals sentenced by the Bench, but often criminals sentenced by other non-military courts in Poland. They were well paid, sometimes functioned as physicians, but were also often considered social outcasts and lived outside the city walls.

A village mayor was called the &quot;sołtys&quot; and was the administrative, executive and judicial chief for the village, responsible only to the village&#x27;s owner.

==Fictional offices==
Fictional or fictitious offices were a specific kind of offices, as they referred to the territories which Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth lost in the second half of the 17th century either to the Swedish Empire or the Tsardom of Russia. Following the Treaty of Oliva (1660), the Commonwealth officially lost Wenden Voivodeship, Parnawa Voivodeship, and Dorpat Voivodeship. Furthermore, as a result of the Truce of Andrusovo (1667), Poland-Lithuania lost Smolensk Voivodeship and Czernihow Voivodeship.

Despite the fact that these territories did not belong to the Commonwealth any longer, and were under foreign rule, their administration existed for further 100 years, until the Partitions of Poland, with a complex hierarchy of all kinds of regional offices. The existence of fictional titles was the result of the special role of offices in the minds of the Polish–Lithuanian nobility: even though these offices were only honorary, without any material privileges and salaries, they determined social status of their bearers. Furthermore, having a title, albeit fictional, emphasized the position of an individual nobleman as a keen citizen and co-creator of the Commonwealth.

After Czernihow Voivodeship was detached from Poland in 1667, sejmiks of the former province took place at Wlodzimierz Wolynski, some 500 kilometers west of Czernihow. Polish kings continued to present fictional titles of voivodes, senators, deputies, and starostas of Czernihow to their courtiers. In 1785, Stanisław August Poniatowski gave fictitious title of starosta of Nowogrod Siewierski to Tadeusz Czacki.

<text>Strung Out is an American punk rock band from Simi Valley, California, formed in 1991. Their sound fuses punk with elements of heavy metal. They have released nine studio albums on Fat Wreck Chords as well as one live album, two B-sides collections, a best-of, a box set, and appeared on numerous compilations and skate/surf/dirt bike/offroading videos. They have played on the Warped Tour and continue to tour internationally. The band currently has an ongoing collaboration beer with Lucky Luke Brewing Company called “Astrolux Golden Ale”. Their albums have charted on the Billboard 200.

==History==
The band formed in 1991 in Simi Valley, California. The original lineup consisted of vocalist Jason Cruz, guitarist Rob Ramos, bassist Jim Cherry and drummer Adam Austin. After releasing a self-titled 7&quot; record in 1993, they became one of the first bands to be signed to Fat Wreck Chords, the record label owned and operated by Fat Mike of the band NOFX. Austin left the band in 1992, and was replaced by Brad Morrison. Jake Kiley joined as second guitarist in 1993. Morrison left the band in 1993, and was replaced by Jordan Burns, formerly of fellow Simi Valley natives Ten Foot Pole. This lineup (Cruz, Ramos, Cherry, Kiley, and Burns) wrote and recorded the band’s first album, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, which was tracked in late 1993, and released in May 1994. &quot;Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues&quot; followed in 1996. In 1998 they released &quot;The Skinny Years...Before We Got Fat&quot;, a compilation album of their pre-Fat Wreck Chords material.

Bassist Jim Cherry was fired from the band due to conflict about his publishing and between the members in 1999 and went on to play in Pulley and Zero Down. Initially, Jim was replaced by Craig Riker (Jughead’s Revenge), who played on the track Klawsterfobia (Short Music for Short People). This was a brief stint, ultimately being replaced by Chris Aiken, whose musical background had a strong impact on the 2000 eight-song EP, &quot;The Element of Sonic Defiance&quot;.

In 2002, the band released their fourth full-length album &quot;An American Paradox&quot;, their first release to appear in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The initial production run contained a bonus song entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;. A video was filmed for the song &quot;Cemetery&quot; and was included on several punk rock video compilations. In 2003 they recorded and released a live album as part of the Fat Wreck Chords &quot;Live in a Dive&quot; series. &quot;Exile in Oblivion&quot;, was released on November 2, 2004, with a video filmed for the song &quot;Analog.&quot; Strung Out released their sixth full-length album, &quot;Blackhawks Over Los Angeles&quot; on June 12, 2007.

In March 2009, Strung Out released a collection of rarities &amp; B-sides entitled &quot;Prototypes and Painkillers&quot;. The album is the second such compilation from the band who previously compiled similar material on &quot;The Skinny Years: Before We Got Fat&quot; in 1998.

On September 29, 2009, Strung Out released their 7th studio album titled &quot;Agents of the Underground&quot;.

On July 19, 2011, they released the compilation album &quot;Top Contenders: The Best of Strung Out&quot;. In contains remastered versions of 23 songs, and 3 new songs; &quot;City Lights&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, and &quot;Here We Are&quot;.

On August 2, 2012, drummer Jordan Burns revealed to Punknews.org that Strung Out planned to release a new album. &quot;Transmission.Alpha.Delta&quot; was announced as the title of the album, initially scheduled to be released in the summer of 2014. The album was delayed and released on March 24, 2015.

On February 19, 2018, the band announced on their Facebook page that Jordan Burns is no longer the drummer. Soon after it was revealed that RJ Shankle of the band Runaway Kids was selected to be the new drummer of Strung Out. Daniel Blume was tapped to fill in for RJ on select dates throughout 2018, while RJ fulfilled his prior obligations with Runaway Kids.

On April 18, 2018, the band released an eight-song EP called &quot;Black Out the Sky&quot;, which was inspired by Alice in Chains&#x27; 1994 acoustic EP &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;.

On January 7, 2019 both Strung Out and Jason Cruz posted to their respective social media accounts that the band was in the studio recording a new album. Cruz later confirmed that the album was not an acoustic recording like &quot;Black Out The Sky&quot; but rather a full punk rock album. In another series of posts by Jason Cruz revealed &quot;Agents of the Underground&quot; producer Cameron Webb would be returning to produce the upcoming album.

On May 15, 2019, Jason Cruz announced the name of the upcoming Strung Out album, &quot;Songs of Armor and Devotion&quot; on Episode 15 of the Dying Scene Podcast. The album was released August 9, 2019. It embodied a return to speed, upping the tempo from the previous two albums. Regarded as one of, if not the most, technically ambitious Strung Out records to date.

In January 2023, the band officially revealed that they were in the studio working on a new album with new drummer Daniel Blume, following RJ Shankle&#x27;s departure in late 2022. It was revealed on April 21, 2023 via the band&#x27;s social media that the title of the album would be &quot;Dead Rebellion&quot;.

In March of 2024, the band went out on tour in support of &quot;Dead Rebellion&quot;, this time without Jake Kiley.. Although Kiley was credited with significant songwriting contributions on &quot;Dead Rebellion&quot;, the band admitted that Kiley&#x27;s parts aside from a few guitar solos were largely removed from the album and were re-recorded by Chris Aiken.

<text>Rudolfo Anaya (October 30, 1937June 28, 2020) was an American author. Noted for his 1972 novel &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot;, Anaya was considered one of the founders of the canon of contemporary Chicano and New Mexican literature. The themes and cultural references of the novel, which were uncommon at the time of its publication, had a lasting impression on fellow Latino writers. It was subsequently adapted into a film and an opera.

==Early life and education==
Rudolfo Anaya was raised in Santa Rosa, New Mexico. His father, Martín Anaya, was a &quot;vaquero&quot; from a family of cattle workers and sheepherders. His mother, Rafaelita (Mares), was from a family composed of farmers from Puerto De Luna in the Pecos Valley of New Mexico. Anaya grew up with two half-brothers, from his mother&#x27;s previous marriage, and four sisters. The beauty of the desert flatlands of New Mexico, referenced as the &quot;llano&quot; in Anaya&#x27;s writings, had a profound influence on his early childhood.

Anaya&#x27;s family relocated from rural New Mexico to Albuquerque in 1952, when he was in the eighth grade. He attended Albuquerque High School, graduating in 1956. This experience later appeared as an autobiographical allusion in his novel &quot;Tortuga&quot;. When he was 16 he sustained a spinal cord injury which left him temporarily paralyzed. Following high school, he earned a B.A. in English and American Literature from the University of New Mexico in 1963. He went on to complete two master&#x27;s degrees at the University of New Mexico, one in 1968 for English and another in 1972 for guidance and counseling. While earning his master&#x27;s degrees, Anaya worked as a high school English teacher in the Albuquerque public schools from 1963 until 1968. In 1966, he married Patricia Lawless, who continued to support his writing.

==Career==
He began writing his best-known work &quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; in 1963, with the manuscript completed and published by Quinto Sol in 1972. Initially, Anaya faced tremendous difficulty getting his work published by mainstream publishing houses because of its unique combination of English and Spanish language, as well as its Chicano-centric content. Independent publishing house Quinto Sol quickly published the book after awarding it the Premio Quinto Sol in 1971 for best novel written by a Chicano. The book went on to sell over 300,000 copies in 21 printings. The themes and cultural references touched on in the novel were uncommon at the time of its publication. Consequently, it ended up having a lasting impact on a generation of Latino writers.

Following the book&#x27;s success, Anaya was invited to join the English faculty at the University of New Mexico in 1975, where he taught until his retirement in 1993.

Anaya traveled extensively through both China in 1984, and South America following his retirement. His experiences in China are chronicled in his travel journal, &quot;A Chicano in China&quot;, published in 1986.

During the 1990s, Anaya found an even wider audience as mainstream publishing house Warner books signed him on for a six-book deal beginning with the novel &quot;Alburquerque&quot;. He subsequently created the Sonny Baca mystery series which included &quot;Zia Summer&quot;, &quot;Rio Grande Fall&quot;, &quot;Jalamanta: A Message from the Desert&quot;, and &quot;Shaman Winter&quot;. &quot;The Anaya Reader&quot;, a collection of his works, followed.

&quot;Bless Me, Ultima&quot; was released as a feature film on February 22, 2013. It was subsequently adapted into an opera three years later. Anaya also published a number of books for children and young adults. His first children&#x27;s book was &quot;The Farolitos of Christmas&quot;, published in 1995.

Anaya&#x27;s non-fiction work has appeared in many anthologies. In 2015, 52 of his collected essays exploring identity, literature, immigration, and politics were published as &quot;The Essays&quot; with Open Road Media. In summarizing his career, Anaya stated &quot;What I’ve wanted to do is compose the Chicano worldview—the synthesis that shows our true mestizo identity—and clarify it for my community and for myself.&quot;

Anaya lived in Albuquerque, where each day he spent several hours writing. He died at his home on June 28, 2020, at the age of 82. He had been suffering from a long illness in the time leading up to his death.

<doc id="1092526" wikidata="Q8007589" url="?curid=1092526" title="William Darke">
<text>William Darke (1736 – November 26, 1801) was an American soldier who served with British forces before the Revolutionary War. He served with British regulars commanded by Major General Edward Braddock in his 1755 expedition to the French-controlled Ohio Valley, as part of the French and Indian War. The British forces were defeated and Braddock died.

Darke survived to be commissioned as a captain at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War. He was made prisoner at the Battle of Germantown. He was commanding colonel of the Hampshire and Berkeley regiments at the capture of General Cornwallis. Darke was often a member of the Virginia legislature and, during the convention of 1788, voted for the Federal Constitution.

As lieutenant-colonel of the regiment of &quot;Levies&quot; in 1791, he commanded the left wing of St. Clair&#x27;s army at its defeat by the Miami Indians on November 4, 1791. He made two unsuccessful charges in that fight: his younger son, Captain Joseph Darke, died in the second, and he himself was wounded and barely survived. Darke wrote a letter to President George Washington that described the battle. Afterward, Darke served as a major-general of the Virginia militia.

== Early life ==
William Darke was born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania on May 6, 1736, the son of Joseph Darke and his wife, according to the &quot;Hopewell Friends History.&quot; He was descended from early Quaker settlers at the Falls in Bucks County. He was a cousin of Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of Independence.

As a young child in 1740, Darke moved with his family moved to the Elk Branch near Shepherdstown, Virginia. Darke had two brothers and one sister. As a child he contributed to the household: he fished, ploughed, and planted. He was described as &quot;a strong man of his hands&quot;, and &quot;herculean&quot;.

== Military career ==
During the French and Indian War, Darke served with George Washington in the 1755 Braddock Expedition under the command of British General Edward Braddock. Braddock&#x27;s plan was to capture Fort Duquesne from the French to gain control over the Ohio River and valley. Even though there were many casualties and the British were defeated, Darke was not injured. Braddock died in the battle.

In the American Revolutionary War, Darke served as a Continental Army captain in the 8th Virginia Regiment; he was wounded and taken prisoner at the Battle of Germantown in 1777. He was held in a British prison ship in New York Harbor until his exchange in 1780. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel and was probably present at the siege of Yorktown in 1781.

After the war, he was sent out against the insurgents in the Whiskey Rebellion in 1784. With peace established, Darke served in the Virginia Convention in 1788 and subsequently was elected to and served in the Virginia legislature. As a lieutenant colonel in the Kentucky militia, Darke commanded the left wing at the disastrous Battle of the Wabash in 1791 during the Northwest Indian War. His son Captain Joseph Darke died as a result of wounds received in the battle.

In 1790, General Josiah Harmar, with a poorly trained and ill-equipped army and volunteer militia, was sent to attack the Northwestern Confederacy of Indians on the upper Maumee River. Harmar was soundly defeated. President George Washington reinforced the army and assigned General Arthur St. Clair to command. St. Clair went north from Fort Washington, Ohio and built Fort Hamilton and Fort Jefferson. In October 1791, St. Clair left Fort Jefferson and camped at a spot later called Fort Recovery on November 3, 1791. On November 4, his army of 1,400 men was surprised at sunrise by a large party of Indians. Within a few hours, St. Clair was forced to retreat under cover provided by Darke. Nine hundred men, women and children were reportedly killed.

== Personal life ==
Darke married Sarah, the widow of William Delayea, an Indian fighter. The two had four children: John, Joseph, Samuel, and Mary. His three sons all died while young men. Darke took in Thomas Worthington, the 14-year-old orphaned son of a family friend, and gave him an education. Worthington became the sixth governor of Ohio. William Darke has descendants through son John&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth and through daughter Mary&#x27;s two marriages.

== Legacy ==
Darke County, Ohio is named for him, as is Darkesville, West Virginia.

<doc id="1092527" wikidata="Q3508705" url="?curid=1092527" title="Timothy syndrome">
<text>Timothy syndrome is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by physical malformations, as well as neurological and developmental defects, including heart QT-prolongation, heart arrhythmias, structural heart defects, syndactyly (webbing of fingers and toes), and autism spectrum disorders. Timothy syndrome represents one clinical manifestation of a range of disorders associated with mutations in &quot;CACNA1C&quot;, the gene encoding the calcium channel Cav1.2 α subunit.

==Signs and symptoms==
The most striking sign of Timothy syndrome type 1 is the co-occurrence of both syndactyly (about 0.03% of births) and long QT syndrome (1% per year) in a single patient. Other common symptoms include cardiac arrhythmia (94%), heart malformations (59%), and autism or an autism spectrum disorder (80% who survive long enough for evaluation). Facial dysmorphologies such as flattened noses also occur in about half of patients. Children with this disorder have small teeth, which is due to poor enamel coating, are prone to dental cavities and often require removal. The average age of death due to complications of these symptoms is 2.5 years, although there have been multiple reports of patients living in to their mid- or late-twenties.

Timothy syndrome type 2 has largely the same symptoms as the classical form. Differences in the type 2 form are the lack of syndactyly, the presence of musculoskeletal problems (particularly hyperflexible joints), and often hip dysplasia. Patients with Timothy syndrome type 2 also have more facial deformities, including protruding foreheads and tongues.

Children with Timothy syndrome tend to be born via caesarean section due to fetal distress.

==Pathophysiology==

There are two recognized types of Timothy syndrome, classical (type-1) and a second type (type-2). They are both caused by mutations in &quot;CACNA1C&quot;, the gene encoding the calcium channel Cav1.2 α subunit. Timothy syndrome mutations in &quot;CACNA1C&quot; cause delayed channel closing, also known as voltage-dependent inactivation, thus increased cellular excitability.

Both types of Timothy syndromes are caused by mutations in &quot;CACNA1C&quot;. These mutations are in exon 8 (type 2) and exon 8a (classical form, type 1). Exons 8 and 8A are mutually exclusive exons. Exon 8a is highly expressed in the heart, brain, gastrointestinal system, lungs, immune system, and smooth muscle. Exon 8 is also expressed in these regions and its level is roughly five-fold higher than exon 8a expression.

One mutation is found in patients with classical Timothy syndrome, &quot;G406R&quot;, located just past the sixth membrane-spanning segment of domain 1 (D1S6). The conserved glycine at this position seems to be vital for proper voltage-dependent inactivation, as the mutant is lacking in this respect. Timothy syndrome type 2 mutations are similar, being the identical &quot;G406R&quot; mutation in the other splice form. A second mutation resulting in &quot;G402S&quot;, located a few amino acids upstream, was originally also given the name of type 2, but it is now recognized as a variant that causes non-syndromic LQT8. The effect of the &quot;G406R&quot; mutations on channel function is identical in the two forms of Timothy syndrome. The lack of proper voltage-dependent inactivation in these mutants causes prolonged inward current and depolarization during cardiac action potentials. This leads to long QT syndrome and resultant arrhythmia. Because exon 8 has greater expression in the heart versus exon 8a, patients with Timothy syndrome type 2 have worsened cardiac defects compared to those with the classical form.

A pig model of the disease, carrying the same mutation as the one found in patients, allowed to identify that the calcium overload state leads the development of a substrate for functional reentry characterised by slowing of cardiac impulse propagation. Single cell studies identified that CaMKII autophosphorylation reduced the peak sodium current, thus causing the slowing of conduction.

==Diagnosis==

Syndactyly and other deformities are typically observed and diagnosed at birth. Long QT syndrome sometimes presents itself as a complication due to surgery to correct syndactyly. Other times, children collapse spontaneously while playing. In all cases, it is confirmed with ECG measurements. Sequencing of the &quot;CACNA1C&quot; gene further confirms the diagnosis.

==Treatment==

Surgery is typically used to correct structural heart defects and syndactyly. Propranolol or other beta-adrenergic blockers are often prescribed, as well as insertion of a pacemaker to maintain proper heart rhythm. With the characterization of Timothy syndrome mutations indicating that they cause defects in calcium currents, calcium channel blockers may be effective as a therapeutic agent.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis for patients diagnosed with Timothy syndrome is very poor. Of 17 children analyzed in one study, 10 died at an average age of 2.5 years. Of those that did survive, three were diagnosed with autism, one with an autism spectrum disorder, and the last had severe delays in language development. One patient with the &quot;G402S&quot; mutation was largely normal with the exception of heart arrhythmia. Likewise, the mother of two Timothy syndrome patients also carried the mutation, but lacked any obvious phenotype. In both of these cases, however, the lack of severity of the disorder was due to mosaicism.

==History==
Some of the abnormalities observed in Timothy syndrome were described in the 1990s. However, it was linked with calcium channel abnormalities in 2004, and the disorder was thence named &quot;Timothy syndrome&quot; in honor of Katherine W. Timothy, who was among the first to identify a case and performed much of the phenotypic analysis that revealed other abnormalities.

<text>FatWallet was a comparison shopping website, centering on a set of forums that allowed users to publish deals and rebate offers on products and services, with computer-related products and electronics most prominent in the listings. It was headquartered in Beloit, Wisconsin, and ceased operation on October 9, 2017.

==Products and services==

===Coupons and Cash Back===
FatWallet featured a &quot;Coupons&quot; section where users could find discounts from online retailers.

Before being acquired, FatWallet also featured its own &quot;Cash Back&quot; rebate shopping section, in which members received back a percentage of purchases made through referral links to partnered retailers. FatWallet has since ended the cash back program and now directs its members to the program offered by Rakuten.

===Forums===
FatWallet users posted the sale prices of major retailers, often before they were officially released in retailers&#x27; advertisements, which involved the site in a legal dispute in 2002 involving Black Friday advertisements. Several retailers, including Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Staples, have served FatWallet with &quot;take-down&quot; notices pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, claiming that their sale prices were copyrighted and must be removed from the FatWallet site. In addition, Wal-Mart served FatWallet with a subpoena to reveal the identity of the users who had posted Wal-Mart&#x27;s prices, but the demand was later dropped.

Although FatWallet initially complied with the take-down notices due to the fear of liability, within two weeks it reposted the prices and argued that the prices were facts rather than expression, and therefore not subject to copyright. FatWallet filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against three of the retailers, seeking damages for knowing assertion of invalid copyright claims and a declaratory judgment that the take-down provisions of the DMCA were unconstitutional. The case, &quot;FatWallet, Inc. v. Best Buy Enterprise Services, Inc.&quot;, was dismissed. The court ruled that FatWallet lacked standing to sue for any harm done to its users for having their postings temporarily removed, and FatWallet did not assert any injury to itself that the court found cognizable.

Since its launch, FatWallet has expanded its forums to include discussion on other financial topics such as investments, banking and credit cards. The Finance forum has been mentioned in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; referencing personal finance topics including on credit cards and 401K investment tips.

FatWallet launched &quot;Best Deals&quot; in 2009 (initially called &quot;Today&#x27;s Top Deals&quot;), which features researched deals found on the internet by staff and members. Best Deals also features an &quot;Expert Picks&quot; section where staff research bigger ticket retail products like laptops, computers and HDTVs for the best value for the price, and post their endorsements each week.

==Relocation==

Between March and April 2011, FatWallet moved to Beloit, Wisconsin, from Rockton, Illinois, in order to avoid termination of affiliate contracts with online retailers such as Amazon.com, which provide about 30% of the company&#x27;s revenue. An Illinois law passed in March 2011 in anticipation of passage of the U.S. Main Street Fairness Act, required online retailers with Illinois affiliates to collect and remit sales taxes to the state.

==Acquisitions==

FatWallet was sold to Ebates (now Rakuten Rewards) in 2011, at the same time as AnyCoupons, and later merged with Ebates to form a new company called Performance Marketing Brands. Former owner and founder Tim Storm stayed on as a strategic adviser for the new company.

FatWallet&#x27;s parent company, Ebates (now Rakuten Rewards) was sold to Rakuten, as announced September 9, 2014. FatWallet was wholly sold during the transaction.

==Shutdown==
On September 20, 2017, Tim Storm posted on his Facebook page the following:

Shortly thereafter, a FatWallet employee confirmed that FatWallet&#x27;s owner, Rakuten, would be shutting down the website, but was unable to provide further details.

On September 22, 2017, FatWallet General Manager Ryan Washatka officially confirmed the site would be shutting down, although the timeline was yet to be determined.

On October 9, 2017, at approximately 4:00 p.m. EST, the site went offline and began redirecting to Ebates.com.

==Awards==
FatWallet was twice named one of the &quot;50 Best Places To Work in America&quot; by the Best Places To Work Institute and &quot;Entrepreneur&quot; magazine. It was ranked at #20 on the list for best small businesses in 2010, and #13 in 2011. Founder Tim Storm was also named as one of four finalists for Entrepreneur of 2010 by Entrepreneur.com.

<doc id="1092543" wikidata="Q16971759" url="?curid=1092543" title="Box social">
<text>Box social is a term for a social event that was widely used in the early 1900s with varying definitions in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States.

==American usage==

In the U.S. state of Vermont the tradition is that women decorate a cardboard box and fill it with a lunch or dinner for two. The men bid on the women&#x27;s boxes anticipating a meal with the woman whose box it is. Generally the boxes are anonymous, so the men don&#x27;t know which woman belongs to which box, nor what the box contains, the mystery and sometimes humorous results adding to the fun. However, it is not unknown for a young woman to surreptitiously drop hints to a favored man indicating which box is hers, as a way of rigging the results. The bidding involves teasing, joking, and competition. The event frequently takes place in a town hall, school gymnasium, or church hall.
The practice had fallen out of favor with young people in the 1970s–1990s, but has seen some resurgence in recent years. The rules today have become less rigid. Men now provide boxes as well, but the goal remains the same: raising money for a school, church, or civic project.

A notable example from pop culture is the second act of the musical &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, which is set at a box social.

<text>&quot;We Three Kings&quot;, original title &quot;Three Kings of Orient&quot;, also known as &quot;We Three Kings of Orient Are&quot; or &quot;The Quest of the Magi&quot;, is a Christmas carol that was written by John Henry Hopkins Jr. in 1857. At the time of composing the carol, Hopkins served as the rector of Christ Episcopal Church in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, and he wrote the carol for a Christmas pageant in New York City. It was the first widely popular Christmas carol written in America.

John Henry Hopkins Jr. organized the carol in such a way that three male voices would each sing a solo verse in order to correspond with the three kings. The first and last verses of the carol are sung together by all three as &quot;verses of praise&quot;, while the intermediate verses are sung individually with each king describing the gift he was bringing. The refrain proceeds to praise the beauty of the Star of Bethlehem. The Magi&#x27;s solos are typically not observed during contemporary performances of the carol.

The carol&#x27;s melody has been described as &quot;sad&quot; and &quot;shifting&quot; in nature. Because of this, it highly resembles a song from the Middle Ages and Middle Eastern music, both of which it has been frequently compared to.

===Context===
The carol centres around the Biblical Magi, who visited Jesus as a child in a manger () sometime after his Nativity and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh while paying homage to him. Though the event is recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, there are no further details given in the New Testament with regards to their names, the number of Magi that were present or whether they were even royal. There are, however, verses in the Old Testament that foretell of the visitors: Isaiah 60:6: &quot;The wealth of the nations will come to you. A multitude of camels will cover you. The young camels of Midian and Ephah; All those from Sheba will come; They will bring gold and frankincense, and will bear good news of the praises of the Lord.&quot; (New American Standard Bible), and two selections from the Psalms – Psalm 72:10: &quot;The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall pay tribute, and the kings of Arabia and Saba offer gifts&quot; and Psalm 72:15: &quot;...and may there be given to him gold from Arabia&quot; (New American Standard Bible). Hence, the names of the Magi—Melchior, Caspar and Balthazar—and their status as kings from the Orient are legendary and based on tradition. The number three stems from the fact that there were three separate gifts that were given. The solo verses and final verse make explicit a tradition according to which the three gifts symbolize three aspects of Jesus, as &quot;King&quot; (gold, representing wealth and power) and &quot;God&quot; (incense, representing worship) and &quot;sacrifice&quot; (myrrh, used to embalm the dead).

==Background and influence==
At the time he was writing &quot;We Three Kings&quot; in 1857, John Henry Hopkins Jr. was serving as the rector of Christ Episcopal Church in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Although he originally worked as a journalist for a New York newspaper and studied to become a lawyer, he chose to join the clergy upon graduating from the University of Vermont. Hopkins studied at the General Theological Seminary in New York City and after graduating and being ordained a deacon in 1850, he became its first music teacher five years later, holding the post until 1857 alongside his ministry in the Episcopal Church.

During his final year of teaching at the seminary, Hopkins wrote &quot;We Three Kings&quot; for a Christmas pageant held at the college. It was noteworthy that Hopkins composed both the lyrics and music; contemporary carol composers usually wrote either the lyrics or music but not both. Originally titled &quot;Three Kings of Orient&quot;, it was sung within his circle of family and friends. Because of the popularity it achieved among them, Hopkins decided to publish the carol in 1863 in his book &quot;Carols, Hymns, and Songs&quot;. It was the first Christmas carol originating from the United States to achieve widespread popularity, as well as the first to be featured in &quot;Christmas Carols Old and New&quot;, a collection of carols that was published in the United Kingdom. In 1916, the carol was printed in the hymnal for the Episcopal Church; that year&#x27;s edition was the first to have a separate section for Christmas songs. &quot;We Three Kings&quot; was also included in &quot;The Oxford Book of Carols&quot; published in 1928, which praised the song as &quot;one of the most successful of modern composed carols&quot;.

==In popular music==
Jazz, rock, and reggae musicians recorded &quot;We Three Kings&quot;.
*Percy Faith (1958)
*Ramsey Lewis (1964)
*The Beach Boys (1964)
*Jethro Tull (2003) &quot;We Five Kings&quot;
*Blondie (2009)

In the televised cartoon &quot;A Claymation Christmas Celebration&quot; (1987), the Three Kings sing the verses in traditional choral style, while their camels perform the chorus as a doo-wop song. Credits for the singers are not available.

==Parodies==
Since the 1950s, the carol has been frequently parodied by children. The subject of the lyrics vary widely depending upon the region, with references to smoking explosive rubber cigars, selling counterfeit lingerie, or travelling to an Irish bar by taxi, car, and scooter.

<text>Gang Resistance Education And Training, abbreviated G.R.E.A.T., provides a school-based, police officer-instructed program in America that includes classroom instruction and a variety of learning activities.

The program was originally administered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) of the US Department of the Treasury; however, when the ATF was transferred to the United States Department of Justice, it became administered by the Office of Justice Programs of the Bureau of Justice Assistance.

==History==
GREAT originated through a combined effort of the ATF and the Phoenix Police Department, Phoenix, Arizona. The effort was congressionally supported as part of the ATF&#x27;s Project Outreach.

The program originally began as a nine-lesson middle-school curriculum. In early 1992, the first GREAT Officer Program was conducted in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1993, due to its perceived success, the program was expanded nationwide. In 1993–98, the program added the regional partners, a national policy board, and thousands of trained officers.

In 2000, the program underwent a curriculum review, which was the result of a study conducted by the National Institute of Justice. The original program went to 13 lessons. The new curriculum was piloted in 14 cities nationwide.

From 2006 to 2012, a multi-site program evaluation was conducted. Based on the results, the &quot;program holds promise as a universal gang prevention program.&quot;

==Curriculum==
Middle School Component: The curriculum has integrated National English Language Arts Standards and National Health Education Standards. The G.R.E.A.T. middle school curriculum was designed for students in 6th or 7th grade. The G.R.E.A.T. middle school curriculum consists of thirteen 30- to 45-minute lessons taught in sequential order:

# Welcome to G.R.E.A.T.
# What&#x27;s the Real Deal?
# It&#x27;s About Us
# Where Do We Go From Here
# Decisions, Decisions, Decisions
# Do You Hear What I Am Saying?
# Walk in Someone Else&#x27;s Shoes
# Say It Like You Mean It
# Getting Along Without Going Along
# Keeping Your Cool
# Keeping It Together
# Working It Out
# G.R.E.A.T. Days Ahead

Each lesson is accompanied by a parent letter that the student takes home, explaining the lesson and encouraging parent-student interaction:

# G.R.E.A.T. Beginnings
# To Do or Not to Do
# Loud and Clear
# Staying Cool When the Heat Is On
# We&#x27;re All in This Together
# G.R.E.A.T. Days Ahead

==Officer selection==
Officers will be under the supervision of the G.R.E.A.T. supervisor. Major disciplinary problems may result in the non-certification of the officer. G.R. Each agency will receive an evaluation of officer performance at the conclusion of the training, which begins with intensive one-week or two-week training.

==Evaluation==

From 2006 to 2012, a multi-site program evaluation was conducted. Approximately 4,000 students attending 31 schools in seven cities comprised the initial sample. 195 classrooms (102 received G.R.E.A.T. and 93 did not receive the program) during the 2006–2007 school year. There were 28 attitudinal or perceptual measures that address potential outcomes of the G.R.E.A.T. program that were examined. The differences in rates of delinquency are 7% lower for G.R.E.A.T. students, and violent offences are 10% lower for G.R.E.A.T. students.

Results from analyses of six waves of survey data collected from students in seven U.S. public school districts indicate a 39% reduction in the odds of gang members joining one year post-program as well as a 24% reduction four years post the program.

===Usage in arcade games===
In the 1990s, GREAT had a message that appeared in arcade games with an emblem that read &quot;GREAT LIFE: A Most Excellent Adventure Without GANGS&quot; with the &quot;GANGS&quot; part in a crossed-out circle. On the left of the emblem is the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms logo with &quot;Steve Higgins Director&quot; under it, and on the right of the emblem is the Phoenix Police Department logo with &quot;Dennis Garrett Chief&quot; under it.

<text>Christopher John Nowinski (born September 24, 1978) is an American neuroscientist, author and retired professional wrestler. After extensively researching concussions in American football, Nowinski co-founded the Concussion Legacy Foundation, where he is currently CEO and co-founded Boston University&#x27;s CTE Center. As a professional wrestler, he is best known for his tenure with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring name Chris Harvard and later under his real name.

==Early life and education==
Nowinski attended John Hersey High School in Arlington Heights, Illinois, serving as team captain of the football and basketball teams. He graduated cum laude from Harvard with a Bachelor of Arts in sociology in 2000. Nowinski played college football for the Crimson as a defensive tackle, earning second-team All-Ivy League honors. He worked as a pharmaceutical and biotech consultant in Boston shortly after graduation.

In 2017, he graduated with a Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from Boston University. He decided to study behavioral neuroscience after a 2003 head injury caused multiple symptoms, including a three-year-long headache.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (2001–2002)===
Nowinski did not begin watching wrestling until his senior year of college. After graduating from Harvard, he joined Killer Kowalski&#x27;s wrestling school in Malden, Massachusetts. Nowinski became one of the three finalists on WWE&#x27;s (at the time trading as WWF) first season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, which Maven Huffman won. After failing to win the competition, Nowinski made appearances in independent promotions in Massachusetts before being hired by WWF and entering its developmental territories. Nowinski competed as Chris Harvard, capitalizing on his status as an alumnus of Harvard University. Nowinski made his first major independent appearance in London, UK for the Frontier Wrestling Alliance promotion at its &quot;Lights Camera Action&quot; show on December 14, 2001. Nowinski competed in its main event teaming up with Alex Shane to defeat Drew McDonald and Flash Barker. Though this was the only show Nowinski did for the promotion, he regards it as the best promotion he has ever worked for outside of WWE. In early 2002 he continued to work in the independents throughout the States and Heartland Wrestling Association in Ohio.

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2003)===
On the June 10, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nowinski debuted in WWE as a heel, helping William Regal beat Bradshaw in a European Championship match. Nowinski had a short-lived alliance with Regal, defeating Spike Dudley in his debut match the following week with Regal in his corner. Nowinski teamed with Regal on the June 24 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Bradshaw and Dudley. Nowinski continued to feud with Bradshaw over the next few weeks, with their feud ending on the July 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Nowinski teamed with Jackie Gayda in a losing effort against Bradshaw and Trish Stratus, while also trying to warm up Regal from his breakdown after he lost the European Championship to Jeff Hardy. Nowinski feuded with The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley) through the summer.

Nowinski defeated Tommy Dreamer on the September 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. A week later, Dreamer attacked Nowinski in a classroom. Their feud ended on the October 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Nowinski was once again successful in defeating Dreamer. Over the next few weeks, Nowinski claimed victories over Jeff Hardy and Booker T before starting a feud with his former Tough Enough trainer, Al Snow. On the November 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nowinski went against Maven in a match that ended in a no contest. Nowinski teamed with D&#x27;Lo Brown to defeat Snow and Maven on two occasions. Nowinski continued his feud with Maven into 2003, where Test aligned himself with Maven for a few weeks, successfully defeating Nowinski and Brown on January 13, 2003, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;.

Nowinski competed in his first-ever Royal Rumble match in 2003, entering at #3. During the match Edge and Rey Mysterio performed a double missile dropkick on Nowinski, but a mistimed execution caused Edge to land on Nowinski&#x27;s head that caused his subsequent post-concussion syndrome later in his career.

Also from February to April 2003, Nowinski made appearances in WWE&#x27;s developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling.

On the March 31 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nowinski was defeated by Scott Steiner. The feud come to an end on the May 12 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Nowinski teamed with La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier) in a losing effort against Steiner, Test and Goldust. On the May 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Nowinski aligned himself with &quot;Thuggin&#x27; And Buggin&#x27; Enterprises&quot;, an African American wrestling stable consisting of Rodney Mack, Jazz and their manager Theodore Long. At Insurrextion, Nowinski teamed with Mack and Long in a losing effort against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley and Spike Dudley). At Bad Blood, Nowinski and Mack defeated Bubba Ray and D-Von. Nowinski wrestled his final televised match, due to him sustaining post-concussion syndrome, on the June 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, in a losing effort against Maven. His last match was on July 12 with Rodney Mack defeating Rosey and Tommy Dreamer at a house show in Green Bay, Wisconsin. After a full year of post-concussion symptoms he chose to retire from wrestling.

==Writing career==

Following his wrestling career, Nowinski authored &quot;Head Games: Football&#x27;s Concussion Crisis&quot; in 2006, which examined the long-term effects of head trauma among athletes, and also became a documentary. &quot;The Lancet&quot; said &quot;the book sent shockwaves through the National Football League (NFL)&quot; and details his career-ending injury and discusses the dangers of concussions in football and other contact sports; the book includes stories from National Football League (NFL) players and fellow wrestlers, and has an introduction written by former governor of Minnesota and professional wrestler, Jesse Ventura.

Later that year, Nowinski initiated an inquiry into the suicide of Andre Waters, a 44-year-old former NFL defensive back who shot himself on November 20, 2006. Waters had sustained several concussions over his career, and at Nowinski&#x27;s behest, Waters&#x27; family agreed to send pieces of his brain to be tested. Bennet Omalu, a pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh announced that &quot;the condition of Waters&#x27; brain tissue was what would be expected in an 85-year-old man, and there were characteristics of someone being in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s&quot;.

Nowinski played a role in the discovery of the fourth case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a former NFL football player, former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, who was killed in an automobile crash in 2004 at age 36. Julian Bailes, the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at West Virginia University and the Steelers&#x27; team neurosurgeon during Strzelczyk&#x27;s career, insisted to Nowinski over a phone conversation that he thought Strzelczyk&#x27;s death, which was precipitated by strange behavior that some had labeled as &quot;bipolar&quot;, was worth looking into due to its similarities to the Andre Waters case. Nowinski contacted Omalu, who discovered the brain was still available, and Nowinski called Mary Strzelczyk, Justin&#x27;s mother, to ask for permission to Omalu to examine it for CTE. Omalu&#x27;s positive diagnosis was confirmed by two other neuropathologists.

Nowinski came together with Ted Johnson, former New England Patriots linebacker, on revealing symptoms of concussions after Johnson (who received over half a dozen concussions in his career) retired from the NFL.

Nowinski alerted police and the coroner of Chris Benoit, asking them to do a brain exam on Benoit&#x27;s brain to see if concussions had any part in his rage or depression at the time of the double-homicide of his family and his suicide. In June 2007, Nowinski co-founded the Sports Legacy Institute (now the Concussion Legacy Foundation), an organization dedicated to furthering awareness of and research on sports-related head injuries, and increasing the safety of contact and collision sports worldwide. Nowinski&#x27;s work was documented on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Outside the Lines&quot; on September 5, 2007. On the same day, Benoit&#x27;s brain examination report showed extensive damage due to concussions that could have led to dementia.

==Concussion Legacy Foundation==
Since Nowinski&#x27;s departure from WWE and the publication of his book &quot;Head Games&quot;, he has garnered a significant amount of media attention, making numerous appearances on networks such as ESPN and CNN to discuss sports-related head injuries. On June 14, 2007, Nowinski and Robert Cantu founded the Concussion Legacy Foundation (CLF) in Boston, Massachusetts in reaction to medical research indicating brain trauma in sports had become a public health crisis. Postmortem analysis of the brain tissue of former contact sports athletes was revealing that repetitive brain injuries, both concussions and subconcussive blows, could lead to the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). An absence of awareness and education on concussions, specifically proper diagnosis and management, was allowing the disease to proliferate. Finally, with brain trauma becoming the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this research/education model could also be applied to the military.

CLF was founded to solve the concussion crisis in sports and the military through medical research, treatment, and education &amp; prevention. The initial vision of the CLF was to formalize neuropathological research and develop and treatment, via partnership with a top-tier university medical school. To that end, the CLF began such a partnership with Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) in September 2008, collaborating in formation of its Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE Center).

CLF has sought to develop ways to raise awareness of the issue and to directly educate coaches, athletes and parents and has been featured in articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, on news programs such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and &quot;Frontline&quot;, and CNN.

In August 2010, Nowinski took offense to Linda McMahon saying during her Senate campaign that she only met recently overdosed wrestler Lance Cade &quot;once&quot; and said it was &quot;absolutely unsafe to work in that ring. They have no oversight into what actually happens in the ring, and they are encouraging steroid use.&quot;

In September 2015, the &quot;Sports Legacy Institute&quot; announced a rebrand and changed its name to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. The rebrand aimed to align the evolution of the organization&#x27;s programs with its name.

Nowinski served as co-director at the CTE Center of BUSM, where he worked closely with Ann McKee, M.D., and other center experts, until 2013. Initially, he worked as a liaison making contact with athletes and families of deceased athletes, to further case studies that examine brain tissues impacted by CTE. As of 2020 he serves as the Outreach, Recruitment, Education, and Public Policy Leader.

&quot;Hockey News&quot; listed Nowinski on its 2011 edition of the 100 Most Powerful people in ice hockey as one of the Top 40 under the age of 40. This recognition was attributed to his ability in getting hockey players to donate brain tissue after death.

In January 2023, Nowinski presented warnings and criticism of an increased prevalence in slap fighting, to include a U.S. based reality show focused on the emerging sport.

==Accomplishments==
===Science and business===

Vice called Nowinski &quot;the man most responsible for making CTE part of the national conversation&quot; and in 2010 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; printed: &quot;It is Nowinski&#x27;s figure which looms behind the doctors and the headlines and the debate roiling over sports&#x27; newfound commitment to minimizing head trauma.&quot;

<text>John Hardin (October 1, 1753 – May 1792) was an American soldier, scout, and frontiersman. As a young man, he fought in Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, in which he was wounded, and gained a reputation as a marksman and &quot;Indian killer.&quot; He served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, where he played a noteworthy role in the American victory at Saratoga in 1777. After the war, he moved to Kentucky, where he fought against Native Americans in the Northwest Indian War. In 1790, he led a detachment of Kentucky militia in a disastrous defeat known as &quot;Hardin&#x27;s Defeat.&quot; In 1792, he was killed while serving as an emissary to the Natives in the Northwest Territory.

==Biography==
John Hardin was born on October 1, 1753, in Fauquier County, Virginia, the first son and fifth child of Martin Hardin (1716–1789) and Lydia (Waters) Hardin. His father was a large landowner who moved his family from Fauquier County to western Pennsylvania when John was twelve years old. Martin Hardin served in the Pennsylvania militia during the American Revolutionary War. Growing up on the frontier, John Hardin became an expert hunter and marksman. He married Jane Daviess; they would have seven children, including Martin D. Hardin, who became a U.S. Senator from Kentucky.

In 1774, Hardin joined a militia company raised by Lord Dunmore, the royal governor of Virginia, as an ensign. In August 1774, at the outset of Lord Dunmore&#x27;s War, Virginia militiamen led by Angus McDonald invaded the Ohio Country and destroyed several Native towns on the Muskingum River. Hardin took part in this expedition as a private in a company from Monongalia County led by Captain Zackquill Morgan. On August 2, Hardin was wounded in a skirmish at Snake&#x27;s Town. A musket ball &quot;penetrated his thigh and lodged near his groin.&quot; The musket ball remained in him for the rest of his life. While recovering from the wound, he is said to have accompanied Lord Dunmore&#x27;s subsequent expedition while on crutches. Hardin&#x27;s frontier exploits gained him a reputation as an &quot;Indian Killer.&quot;

During the American Revolutionary War, John Hardin was a second lieutenant in the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment. He was one of a select number of riflemen chosen to serve in a Regiment detachment known as the Provisional Rifle Corps (or &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Rifles&quot;). During this time, he fought at Saratoga serving directly under Colonel Daniel Morgan. His exploits in the battle are commemorated by a historical marker at Saratoga National Historical Park.

In 1786, after the war, John Hardin and his family settled on a large parcel of land in Washington County, Virginia (now Washington County, Kentucky), where they farmed and raised livestock. They also joined the Methodist church in that area. Hardin had some success as a rancher, continually adding acreage to his original tract. As a militia captain in 1786, Hardin led an attack on a Piankeshaw village near present-day Vincennes, Indiana. This village belonged to a friendly tribe that had been allies with the colonial Americans. In August 1789, he led another militia expedition to Terre Haute, where he attacked a Shawnee party of twenty-two men, women, and children. Three women, one child, and an infant were killed in the attack. Hardin paraded through Vincennes, but Major Jean François Hamtramck lamented that the uneasy peace he had brokered with the Wabash nations would soon end due to the &quot;provocation&quot; of this &quot;Kentucky affair.&quot; Hardin returned to Kentucky with twelve scalps.

Hardin was promoted to colonel and repeatedly engaged Indians during the Northwest Indian War in the Northwest Territory. In 1790, he led a detachment of the Kentucky County militia in the disastrous Battle of Heller&#x27;s Corner (also known as &quot;Hardin&#x27;s Defeat&quot;). This defeat began a long succession of American losses to a Miami chief named Little Turtle. In 1791, Hardin led a force of sixty mounted militiamen, destroying a large Kickapoo village near the mouth of the Big Pine Creek. This was part of General Charles Scott&#x27;s campaign to conquer Ouiatenon.

In May 1792, General James Wilkinson sent Hardin as an emissary to carry American peace terms to the Natives along the Sandusky River. After leaving Fort Washington, Hardin encountered a party of Shawnees, who offered to escort him. While Hardin was sleeping one night, the Shawnees killed him and his servant Freeman. Hardin&#x27;s guide survived.

==Legacy==
Hardin County, Kentucky; Hardin County, Illinois; and Hardin County, Ohio were named for John Hardin. The town of Hardin, Ohio, which is near the location where he was killed, is named for him. 
John Hardin High School in Radcliff, Kentucky, also bears his name.

His son Martin D. Hardin, who married Ann Logan, daughter of General Benjamin Logan. His second-oldest son, Mark, married Mary Adair, daughter of Kentucky governor, John Adair. His grandson, Congressman John J. Hardin, was killed at the Battle of Buena Vista, Mexico. His nephew, Congressman Benjamin Hardin was the father in law of Kentucky Governor John L. Helm and grandfather of General Benjamin Hardin Helm.

<text>The MS Readathon is an annual sponsored reading event held by the MS Societies in Australia, Ireland, the United States, and Canada.

== Australia ==
The MS Readathon in Australia started in 1979. The MS Readathon encourages Australian children to read books, learn about multiple sclerosis (MS) and raise funds to help people living with multiple sclerosis.

Participants read as many books as they can throughout the month of August. The money they raise funds vital services for Australians living with MS, such as MS Family Camps, Family days &amp; family support services. In 2020 over $3.2 million was raised nationally from over 50,000 participants.

== Ireland ==
The MS Readathon in Ireland started in 1988. The annual sponsored read is organized by the charity MS Ireland, encouraging children (and since 2003, adults) to read as many books as possible, and to collect a fixed amount per book from sponsors. The money collected goes towards MS Ireland&#x27;s activities concerning sufferers of multiple sclerosis. In 2003, the charity raised over 1.2 million euros.

<doc id="1092589" wikidata="Q7895997" url="?curid=1092589" title="University of Nottingham Students' Union">
<text>The University of Nottingham Students&#x27; Union (often abbreviated as UoNSU ( /ˈjɒnsuː/)) is the students&#x27; union at the University of Nottingham, England. It is a representative body that aims to represent students to both the university and the wider community.

The Students&#x27; Union is housed in the Portland Building on University Park campus, a building shared with some non-student union activities. The union receives a block grant from the university of over £2 million to support its activities, although the union also raises money through income streams such as the Union shop and a bar.

All members of the University of Nottingham are automatically members of the Students&#x27; Union, unless they use their right to opt out of membership. As such the University of Nottingham Students&#x27; Union has over 34,000 members. The Union obtained charitable status in 2010 and is overseen by a Board of Trustees made up of student-elected sabbatical officers and full-time staff.

==History==

The Students&#x27; Union is a charitable organisation, enshrined by legislation such as the Education Act 1994, and responsible for a number of areas of work: student representation, student activities, student advice on education and welfare, and campaigning.

===Early years===
The Union&#x27;s activity started in the 1880s when a cycling club was formed. At the old university college site in the city centre the &#x27;RAG&#x27; started in 1923. &quot;The Gong&quot; Magazine (now &quot;Impact&quot;, having been &quot;Gongster&quot; and &quot;Bias&quot; at various points) initiated in 1939 was an early sign of developing union life.

===Expansion===

In 1928 the expanding college moved to the new out-of town Highfields Estate and here the Union&#x27;s first permanent residence was in the lower corridor of the Trent Building. By 1956, the Portland Building had been opened, and was originally designated as a Union building, but although the Union is the major user, the management of the building has always rested with the university.

In the 1960s, the Union rationalised its representative system into a series of guilds, mostly based on halls of residence as &#x27;constituencies&#x27;. This system worked well for over two decades, before a critical mass of students came to live outside halls, at which point the strong communities on which the guild system was based lost their universality.

During the 1970s the Union took on a more militant air, with sit-ins and student strikes. This did lead to some positive results, such as student representation of many university committees – an opportunity openly satirised by the 1980s as less of a revolutionary shift than expected.

The pace of change in the Union accelerated after the Robbins Report, as rises in student numbers drove it towards a bigger capacity, more permanent staff and sabbatical officers, more rooms and offices and bigger turnovers and budgets. Income rose from £250,000 in 1982 to £1,480,000 in 2006. Membership rose by 23,000 in the same period, whilst staff numbers more than trebled.

===UNU===
Prior to 2000, the University of Nottingham Students&#x27; Union was known as the &quot;University of Nottingham Union&quot;, abbreviated to UNU. The renaming was intended to clarify the Union&#x27;s status as a students&#x27; union.

Recently, the Union has started to address a number of pressing challenges presented by the dynamism and growth of the university under Sir Colin Campbell – such as provision of union services to members at East Midland sites beyond the main Nottingham campuses.

==Governance==

The Students&#x27; Union is governed by its Constitution and Regulations, a document which is informally known as the &#x27;Big Red Book&#x27;. The Students&#x27; Union also maintains a policy file, which outlines its stance on various issues. The Students&#x27; Union is established by the statutes of the university, which provide that &quot;There shall be a Union of Students of the University&quot; and that &quot;Ordinances shall prescribe the constitution, functions, privileges and other matters relating to the Union of Students.&quot; Ordinance XI: Union of Students fulfils this role. Changes to the Constitution, Regulations and Policy File are typically made by Students&#x27; Union Council; however, the whole membership can vote on a policy in a referendum. In 2016 a referendum was held on whether the Students&#x27; Union would remain a member of the National Union of Students. The referendum was one of a number of referendums held by Students&#x27; Unions following the election of Malia Bouattia as National Union of Students President. The Referendum came back with a strong Yes Vote, this was despite strong and substantiated evidence that the No Campaign predominantly led by students from Nottingham University Conservative Association had been supported including financially by UNiDAYS which caused huge controversy and accusations of incompetence on the part of the returning officer.

===Council===
Students&#x27; Union Council is the highest regularly meeting decision-making body of the Students&#x27; Union. It meets at least seven times per year. For Council to make any binding decisions it has to be quorate; the quorum for Students&#x27; Union Council is set at 50% of voting members of council. Members of Students&#x27; Union Council can be either voting or non-voting members. The voting members are designed to be representative of the membership of the Students&#x27; Union as a whole. Most non-voting members sit on council to represent various views that it is felt important to have represented at this level, but where they do not represent a clear constituency of students. Each Student-Run Service, for example, has a non-voting seat on Council, since it is felt that there will be issues that it will be useful to have their input on, but that those involved in their organisation are already represented through a council rep.

The constituencies for voting members of students&#x27; union council are, for the most part either residential or subject-based. Generally, first year undergraduates are grouped into constituencies determined by their residence, with students in subsequent years represented through their subject or faculty. The remaining Council positions are held by the Executive Officers, JCR and Association Heads, and Student-Run Service Heads.

In 2011 democratic reforms were announced that would in effect abolish Council and replace it with a new democratic structure. The current democratic structures have only been quorate 17% of the time in the past 10 years and it was widely felt that they were not publicised well enough.

===Officers===

There are eight Full-Time officers of the Students&#x27; Union. These are sabbatical roles, which involve the office-holder either taking a year out from their studies, or taking office for a year after they finish their course. These are elected by a cross-campus ballot of all students. The Students&#x27; Union removed the office of President in 2020, replacing it with a Union Development Officer.

There are also seven unpaid non-sabbatical &#x27;Part-Time&#x27; Officers, who hold their positions alongside their studies. These Officers work to represent select constituencies of students and their interests. These officers are elected by a cross-campus ballot of students who self-define into the constituency of the respective officer. These roles were established in 2008.

An individual is allowed to hold a sabbatical position for a maximum of two terms, while there is no term-limit on non-sabbatical roles.

The current Full-Time officers are:

* Activities Officer – Iain Messore
* Community Officer – Ela Taylor
* Education Officer – Scarlett Zhang
* Liberation Officer – Nuri Oluwa
* Postgraduate Officer – Clement Asante
* Sports Officer – James Miller
* Union Development Officer – Nicola Maina
* Welfare &amp; Wellbeing Officer – Ella Chauhan

The current Part-Time Officers are:

* Black &amp; Minority Ethnic Students&#x27; Officer – &quot;Vacant&quot;
* Disabled Students&#x27; Officer – Emily Lavender &amp; George Robinson
* Environment &amp; Social Justice Officer – Holly Oldfield
* International Students&#x27; Officer – Jia Kini
* LGBT+ Students&#x27; Officer – &quot;Vacant&quot;
* Mature Students&#x27; Officer – &quot;Vacant&quot;
* Women*&#x27;s Officer – Charlotte Spencer
* Class Equity Officer: &quot;Vacant&quot;
* Trans Students&#x27; Officer: Harry Forsyth

==Activities==

=== Residential associations ===
More commonly called JCRs (junior common rooms) these committees are elected from students in halls to put on social events throughout the year. There is also a Regional Students Association for students who are not living in halls.

There is a Presidents&#x27; Committee (&#x27;Pres Com&#x27;) where presidents of halls can share best practice. The JCRs are supported by a member of staff called the JCR development worker.
===Networks===
There are several student networks chaired by the respective Part-Time Officers.
* Disabled Students&#x27; Network
* BME Network
* LGBT Network
* Mature Students&#x27; Network
* Women&#x27;s Network
* Environment and Social Justice Network
* International Students&#x27; Network

===Student-Run Services===
The Student-Run Services (SRSs) are set apart from societies since they exist for the benefit of the wider student body. Each Student-Run Service is run by an elected student committee. As of January 2021 there are eight Student Run Services.

* TEC PA &amp; Lighting – Company providing technical services for SU and external events such as concerts and club nights. The group was founded in the 1940s.
* Portland Music Library – CD &amp; Record Library running since the 1970s with over 10,000 CDs and 4000 vinyl records available.
* Impact – the official magazine for students at the University of Nottingham
* Karnival – Europe&#x27;s largest student-run charitable organisation – A rag group which raises money for charity
* New Theatre – Student Theatre company
* Nightline – Welfare-based telephone listening and information service
* URN – Student Radio for Nottingham
* NSTV – Nottingham Student Television, previously known as &#x27;NUTS&#x27; or Nottingham Union Television Station. Re-branding took place in 2014.

Previous Student Run Services have existed including Week One which put on events in freshers week to welcome new students but was abolished in 2014/2015 after Week One Reps had been found encouraging the chanting of violent necrophilia and sexism. The non-SRS replacement Welcome Program was subsequently established to undertake a similar role to Week One with greater oversight to prevent any repetition of such incidents.

=== Societies &amp; Volunteering ===
The University of Nottingham Students&#x27; Union has one of the largest ranges of student societies and volunteering opportunities in the UK. There are over 200 societies that cover a wide range of interests from bell-ringing to chess to gliding. There are also extensive local and international volunteering opportunities at the Students&#x27; Union, notably the InterVol student-led community volunteering initiative, as well as societies that support the British Red Cross and Oxfam.

=== Sports ===
There are over 70 sporting clubs affiliated to the Students&#x27; Union. As well as the Sports Clubs, the Union also runs one of the largest intramural sporting programmes in the country with hundreds of teams competing each week in a variety of sports including rugby, football (5-a-side and 11-a-side), hockey, basketball, ten pin bowling and volleyball. The winners of each sport then compete in an annual intramural varsity match against Loughborough University.

====Varsity Series====
Held annually, the Varsity Series is a series of sports matches against Nottingham Trent University held over the Spring term in ten different disciplines: rugby union (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), hockey (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), basketball (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), football (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s), ice hockey (men&#x27;s), Netball (women&#x27;s), cricket (men&#x27;s), swimming (men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s combined) and rugby league (men&#x27;s).

The series is one of the best attended series in the UK, with over 6,000 watching the ice hockey, and 3,500 watching the football and rugby. The games are held at the top sporting venues in Nottingham; both the football and rugby at Meadow Lane (home of Notts County), and the ice hockey at the National Ice Arena.

===Education Network===
The Education Network is the name given to the Course Rep system. The Network is chaired by the Education Officer. There are 5 Undergraduate Faculty Coordinators and 5 Postgraduate Faculty Reps (both elected in cross campus elections). There are School Reps for each School/Department and finally Course Reps (currently around 1000).

==Campaigns==
The Students&#x27; Union has run a number of campaigns over the years on a wide range of subjects affecting students. These include B-EAT aimed at helping those with eating disorders and an Exam Stress campaign aimed at helping students get through the exam period. Around January when students begin to consider housing options for the next year a campaign is run to help students look for housing. The Student Advice and Representation Centre are also available to check housing contracts free of charge.

===Living wage and anti-casualisation campaign===
Started in 2012/2013 the Living Wage campaign is an ongoing campaign to see the University of Nottingham become a Living Wage Foundation Accredited Employer together with the Students&#x27; Union. The Campaign is led by student campaigners with the backing of the Students&#x27; Union alongside the University and College Union, Unite and Unison Trade Unions and Nottingham Citizens.

==Prizes and awards==
There are currently four levels of awards granted by the Students&#x27; Union to graduating students:
* &quot;Ordo Caligulae&quot;
* Honorary Life Membership
* Union Prize
* Student Experience Award
The Students&#x27; Union makes the following awards to non-students:
* Don Varley Award
* Golden Jubilee Award

===&quot;Ordo Caligulae&quot;===
The &quot;Ordo Caligulae&quot; is the highest award of the Students&#x27; Union, and includes Honorary Life Membership of the Students&#x27; Union, and consequently members of the Ordo Caligulae enjoy those benefits detailed under Honorary Life Membership. Membership of the &quot;Ordo Caligulae&quot; (literally, &quot;The Order of the Boot&quot;) is granted to those &quot;who have given outstanding contribution to the University of Nottingham Students&#x27; Union.&quot; It is probably named after Jesse Boot (later Lord Trent), who was a great benefactor of the university.

Members entering the Ordo Caligulae are presented with a cast metal boot on a pedestal at the Union&#x27;s Annual General Meeting.

===Honorary life membership===
Honorary Life Membership is conferred on those who have furthered the achievements of the aims of the University of Nottingham Students&#x27; Union.

The Students&#x27; Union Constitution lays down certain rights of its members (including Honorary Members):
# Take part in functions organised by the Students&#x27; Union.
# Become members of all Clubs and Societies affiliated to the Students&#x27; Union.
# Attend Union Council, Executive Committee and Standing Committees
# Wear official university colours.

(Further rights, such as the ability to stand and vote in Students&#x27; Union Elections, are reserved for &quot;Full Members&quot; – those registered as students at the university). In recent years typically five to eight new Honorary Life Members have been created in any year.

With typically thirty recipients each year (from a graduating class numbering around 8000) the Union Prize is presented to graduating students of the University of Nottingham in recognition of their contribution to the benefit of the students.

<doc id="1092590" wikidata="Q47685" url="?curid=1092590" title="Coffea arabica">
<text>Coffea arabica (), also known as the Arabica coffee, is a species of flowering plant in the coffee and madder family Rubiaceae. It is believed to be the first species of coffee to have been cultivated and is the dominant cultivar, representing about 60% of global production. Coffee produced from the more acidic, more bitter, and more highly caffeinated robusta bean (&quot;C. canephora&quot;) makes up most of the remaining coffee production. The natural populations of &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; are restricted to the forests of South Ethiopia and Yemen.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Coffea arabica&quot; was first described scientifically by Antoine de Jussieu, who named it &quot;Jasminum arabicum&quot; after studying a specimen from the Botanic Gardens of Amsterdam. Linnaeus placed it in its own genus &quot;Coffea&quot; in 1737.

&quot;Coffea arabica&quot; is one of the polyploid species of the genus &quot;Coffea&quot;, as it carries 4 copies of the 11 chromosomes (44 total) instead of the 2 copies of diploid species. Specifically, &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; is itself the result of a hybridization between the diploids &quot;Coffea canephora&quot; and &quot;Coffea eugenioides&quot;, thus making it an allotetraploid, with &quot;two&quot; copies of two different genomes. This hybridization event at the origin of &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; is estimated between 1.08 million and 543,000 years ago and is linked to changing environmental conditions in East Africa.

==Description==
Wild plants grow between tall, and have an open branching system; the leaves are opposite, simple elliptic-ovate to oblong, long and broad, glossy dark green. The flowers are white, 10–15 mm in diameter, and grow in axillary clusters. The seeds are contained in a drupe (commonly called a &quot;cherry&quot;) 10–15 mm in diameter, maturing bright red to purple and typically containing two seeds, often called coffee beans.

==Distribution and habitat==
Endemic to the southwestern highlands of Ethiopia, &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; is grown in dozens of countries between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer. It is commonly used as an understory shrub. It has also been recovered from the Boma Plateau in South Sudan. &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; is also found on Mount Marsabit in northern Kenya, but it is unclear whether this is a truly native or naturalised occurrence; recent studies support it being naturalised. The species is widely naturalised in areas outside its native land, in many parts of Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, India, China, and assorted islands in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.

The coffee tree was first brought to Hawaii in 1813, and it began to be extensively grown by about 1850. It was formerly more widely grown, especially in Kona, and it persists after cultivation in many areas. In some valleys, it is a highly invasive weed. In the Udawattakele and Gannoruwa Forest Reserves near Kandy, Sri Lanka, coffee shrubs are also a problematic invasive species.

Coffee has been produced in Queensland and New South Wales of Australia, starting in the 1980s and 1990s. The Wet Tropics Management Authority has classified &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; as an environmental weed for southeast Queensland due to its invasiveness in non-agricultural areas.

==History==
The first written record of coffee made from roasted coffee beans (botanical seeds) comes from Arab scholars, who wrote that it was useful in prolonging their working hours. The Arab innovation in Yemen of making a brew from roasted beans spread first among the Egyptians and Turks, and later on found its way around the world. Other scholars believe that the coffee plant was introduced from Yemen, based on a Yemeni tradition that slips of both coffee and &quot;qat&quot; were planted at &quot;Udein&quot; (&#x27;the two twigs&#x27;) in Yemen in pre-Islamic times. Arabica coffee production in Indonesia began in 1699 through the spread of Yemen&#x27;s trade. Indonesian coffees, such as Sumatran and Java, are known for their heavy body and low acidity. This makes them ideal for blending with the higher acidity coffees from Central America and East Africa.

==Cultivation and use==

&quot;Coffea arabica&quot; accounts for 60% of the world&#x27;s coffee production.

&quot;C. arabica&quot; takes approximately seven years to mature fully, and it does best with of rain, evenly distributed throughout the year. It is usually cultivated at an altitude between , but there are plantations that grow it as low as sea level and as high as .

The plant can tolerate low temperatures, but not frost, and it does best with an average temperature between . Commercial cultivars mostly only grow to about 5 m, and are frequently trimmed as low as 2 m to facilitate harvesting. Unlike &quot;Coffea canephora&quot;, &quot;C. arabica&quot; prefers to be grown in light shade.

Two to four years after planting, &quot;C. arabica&quot; produces small, white, highly fragrant flowers. The sweet fragrance resembles the sweet smell of jasmine flowers. Flowers opening on sunny days result in the greatest number of berries. This can be problematic and deleterious, however, as coffee plants tend to produce too many berries; this can lead to an inferior harvest and even damage yield in the following years, as the plant will favor the ripening of berries to the detriment of its own health.

On well-kept plantations, overflowering is prevented by pruning the tree. The flowers only last a few days, leaving behind only the thick, dark-green leaves. The berries then begin to appear. These are as dark green as the foliage until they begin to ripen, at first to yellow and then light red and finally darkening to a glossy, deep red. At this point, they are called &quot;cherries&quot;, which fruit they then resemble, and are ready for picking.

The berries are oblong and about 1 cm long. Inferior coffee results from picking them too early or too late, so many are picked by hand to be able to better select them, as they do not all ripen at the same time. They are sometimes shaken off the tree onto mats, which means ripe and unripe berries are collected together.

The trees are difficult to cultivate and each tree can produce from of dried beans, depending on the tree&#x27;s individual character and the climate that season. The most valuable part of this cash crop is the beans inside. Each berry holds two locules containing the beans. The coffee beans are actually two seeds within the fruit; sometimes, a third seed or one seed, a peaberry, grows in the fruit at the tips of the branches. These seeds are covered in two membranes; the outer one is called the &quot;parchment coat&quot; and the inner one is called the &quot;silver skin&quot;.

On Java, trees are planted at all times of the year and are harvested year-round. In parts of Brazil, however, the trees have a season and are harvested only in winter. The plants are vulnerable to damage in such poor growing conditions as cold or low pH soil, and they are also more vulnerable to pests than the &quot;C. robusta&quot; plant.

It is expected that a medium-term depletion of indigenous populations of &quot;C. arabica&quot; may occur, due to projected global warming, based on IPCC modelling. Climate change—rising temperatures, longer droughts, and excessive rainfall—appears to threaten the sustainability of arabica coffee production, leading to attempts to breed new cultivars for the changing conditions.

Gourmet coffees are almost exclusively high-quality mild varieties of arabica coffee, and among the best known arabica coffee beans in the world are those from Jamaican Blue Mountain, Colombian Supremo, Tarrazú, Costa Rica, Guatemalan Antigua, and Ethiopian Sidamo.

Blends consisting only of Arabica are often labelled &quot;100% Arabica&quot; as a sign of quality. In 2023, several large coffee roasters dropped the &quot;100% Arabica&quot; declaration previously residing on some of their packages and started to blend less expensive Robusta coffee into the mix. To avoid making larger changes to the visual design of the package the Arabica label was replaced by other labeling, keeping the previous ornamental design, thereby presenting a case of shrinkflation. In some case, the coffee is still advertised as &quot;100% Arabica&quot; in flyers in 2024, but is no longer declared so on the actual package.
==Strains==
 One strain of &quot;Coffea arabica&quot; (called AC1, AC2 and AC3 in honour of the geneticist Alcides Carvalho) naturally contains very little caffeine. While beans of normal &quot;C. arabica&quot; plants contain 12 mg of caffeine per gram of dry mass, these mutants contain only 0.76 mg of caffeine per gram, with similar expected cup quality.

== Threats ==
Although it has a huge wild population of 13.5 to 19.5 billion individuals throughout its native range, &quot;C. arabica&quot; is still considered endangered on the IUCN Red List due to numerous threats it faces. Due to being an understory plant, it requires standing forest, making it highly susceptible to the historically significant deforestation levels in Ethiopia; prior to major deforestation, forest cover was thought to be between 25–31% of Ethiopia&#x27;s total land surface, but has dropped to just 4%, and deforestation still continues. In addition, climate change may have a major effect on growing areas for wild &quot;C. arabica&quot; in Ethiopia due to its high-temperature sensitivity, and estimates indicate that population could reduce by 50–80% with a 40–50% reduction in area of occupancy by 2088; climate change can also impact reproductive success. In addition, the main pest of coffee, the coffee berry borer (&quot;Hypothenemus hampei&quot;) may benefit from climate change and colonize higher altitudes that were formerly too cold for it, which can also impact coffee populations.

The conservation of the genetic variation of &quot;C. arabica&quot; relies on conserving healthy populations of wild coffee in the Afromontane rainforests of Yemen. Genetic research has shown coffee cultivation is threatening the genetic integrity of wild coffee because it exposes wild genotypes to cultivars. Nearly all of the coffee that has been cultivated over the past few centuries originated from just a handful of wild plants from Yemen, and the coffee growing on plantations around the world contains less than 1% of the diversity in the wilds of Yemen alone.

Climate change also serves as a threat to cultivated &quot;C. arabica&quot; due to their temperature sensitivity, and some studies estimate that by 2050, over half of the land used for cultivating coffee could be unproductive. The more heat-tolerant &quot;Coffea stenophylla&quot; may replace &quot;C. arabica&quot; as the dominant coffee species in cultivation in order to guard against this.

<doc id="1092591" wikidata="Q5470926" url="?curid=1092591" title="Fort Clarence">
<text>Fort Clarence is a now defunct fortification that is located in Rochester, Kent, England.

==History==

The fort was built between 1808 and 1812 to prevent invaders gaining access from Maidstone Road to the River Medway. The work was composed of a long brick revetted dry ditch running between a fortified guardroom on the Rochester-Maidstone Road to a similar tower alongside the Medway. The principal work (still surviving) is a massive red brick keep, in the style of a medieval castle, which served as gun tower and observation post. In the sides of the tower were embrasures to sweep the ditch with fire. The dry ditch running across St Margaret&#x27;s Street was crossed by drawbridge through a substantial casemated guardhouse in the form of an arch (which was demolished in the 1930s). From the tower ran a series of tunnels to the outlying guardhouses. Behind the dry ditch running from the tower down to Maidstone Road was a range of domestic building and barracks.

After 1815, the fort served a variety of purposes, including military prison and lunatic asylum. After nearby Fort Pitt became a military hospital, the patients were moved from Clarence to a new asylum, although the prison remained, with accounts of floggings being given in local newspapers. The fort was used by the garrison artillery throughout the First World War as a recruiting centre. After the war, a large Territorial and Volunteer Reserve centre was built alongside the site and the main barrack site run down.

During the Second World War, the Home Guard used Fort Clarence as headquarters and, with the invasion scare, the fort was pressed into service again. After the war, the fort became derelict, then in the mid 1960s the GPO (now British Telecom) moved in, demolishing all the barracks, filling in a substantial part of the moat and demolishing the Maidstone Road guardhouse.

The most substantial remains now are the brick gun tower and section of ditch from St Margaret&#x27;s Street into the public gardens opposite. Below the gardens — donated to the city of Rochester by former mayor Charles Willis in memory of a son killed in the First World War — is a sally port with sealed-up door. This connected with tunnel that led to the gun tower and probably to the Medway tower, which is long demolished. Intruders into the tunnel system would have been greeted by fire from loopholes built into the entrance tunnels walls.

The tower was transferred by English Heritage to private developers in the late 1990s and has now been converted to apartments. From the outside, the tower has been restored to pristine condition although there is an obvious contemporary structure added on the roof. On both sides the lowest pair of embrasures appear to be below ground level which indicates that originally the ditch was much deeper and more formidable than it now appears. On the east site, the brow of the hill has also been flattened to allow houses to be built and therefore the strategic dominance of the location harder to visualise. The site is a Grade II listed building.

<doc id="1092597" wikidata="Q7412928" url="?curid=1092597" title="Samuel Whittemore">
<text>Samuel Whittemore Jr. (July 27, 1696 – February 2, 1793) was an American farmer and soldier. He was 78 years old when he became the oldest known colonial combatant in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).

==Biography==
Whittemore was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, in 1696, the second son by that name of Samuel Whittemore Sr. and Hannah Rix, also of Charlestown. He served as a private in Colonel Jeremiah Moulton&#x27;s Third Massachusetts Regiment, where he fought in King George&#x27;s War (1744–48). He was involved in the capture of the French stronghold, the Fortress of Louisbourg in 1745. He moved to Menotomy, Massachusetts (present-day Arlington). Recent sources suggest he fought in the French and Indian War (1754–63) at the age of 64, once again assisting in the capture of the Fortress of Louisbourg, and later in a military expedition against Chief Pontiac in 1763. None of them offer documentation to support such claims, though a nineteenth century reference mentions that he had served as a &quot;Captain of Dragoons.&quot;

===Battles of Lexington and Concord===
On April 19, 1775, British forces were returning to Boston from the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the opening engagements of the war. On their march they were continually shot at by American militiamen.

Whittemore was in his fields when he spotted an approaching British relief brigade under Earl Percy, sent to assist the retreat. Whittemore loaded his musket and ambushed the British grenadiers of the 47th Regiment of Foot from behind a nearby stone wall, killing one soldier. He then drew his dueling pistols, killed a second grenadier and mortally wounded a third. By the time Whittemore had fired his third shot, a British detachment had reached his position; Whittemore drew his sword and attacked. He was subsequently shot in the face, bayoneted numerous times, and left for dead in a pool of blood. He was found by colonial forces, trying to load his musket to resume the fight. He was taken to Dr. Cotton Tufts of Medford, who perceived no hope for his survival. However, Whittemore recovered and lived another 18 years until dying of natural causes at the age of 96.


==Legacy==
A monument stands in the corner plot (611 Mass Ave.) called Whittemore Park at the northeast corner of Massachusetts Avenue and Mystic Street in Arlington, Massachusetts; it reads (inaccurately as to age both at the time and 18 years later):

Near this spot, Samuel Whittemore, then 80 years old, killed three British soldiers, April 19, 1775. He was shot, bayoneted, beaten and left for dead, but recovered and lived to be 98 years of age.
In 2005, Massachusetts Senator Robert Havern III proposed that Whittemore be proclaimed the official state hero of Massachusetts and his memory be commemorated on February 3 each year.

<text>Mike Harding (born 23 October 1944) is an English singer, songwriter, comedian, author, poet, broadcaster and multi-instrumentalist. Harding has also been a photographer, traveller, film maker and playwright.

==Early life and education==
Harding&#x27;s father, Louis Arthur &quot;Curly&quot; Harding, a navigator in the RAF, was killed in the Second World War, a month before his son&#x27;s birth. Harding is of Irish Catholic ancestry on his mother&#x27;s side.

Flight Sergeant Louis Arthur Harding (RAF/574158) was a prewar RAF airman. A navigator on Lancasters, his No. 9 Squadron RAF aircraft LL901 (WS:V) was lost on an operation to Munster, 23/24 September 1944. From the seven crew, six were killed and lie at Holten General Cemetery in the Netherlands. The seventh airman evaded capture.

Harding was educated at St Anne&#x27;s, Crumpsall, and St Bede&#x27;s College, Manchester. He has written of the abuse inflicted on pupils at St Bede&#x27;s, a Roman Catholic school. After a varied career as a road digger, dustbin man, schoolteacher, steel erector, bus conductor, boiler scaler and chemical factory worker, he took a degree in English and Education at the University of Manchester.

==Professional career==
Harding began performing as a folk singer and as a member of several local Manchester bands in the 1960s, making his first recordings for the Topic label. He began telling jokes between songs, eventually extending them into longer humorous anecdotes which became the main focus of his act. He released his first album, &quot;A Lancashire Lad&quot;, in 1972, followed by &quot;Mrs &#x27;Ardin&#x27;s Kid&quot; in 1974. In 1975, the single release of &quot;The Rochdale Cowboy&quot; reached No. 22 in the UK Singles Chart, and brought him national attention.

As a stand-up comic he made several series for the BBC and appeared on numerous television and radio programmes, including two series of travel films in Ireland and the Appalachian Mountains of America. He also played rock and roll with his band, the Stylos, with the Lowe Brothers. He has had many albums and singles released, whilst the latter included &quot;Man &#x27;nited Song&quot;.

As well as comedy, he has released albums of serious songs, most notably &quot;Bombers&#x27; Moon&quot;, the title track of which tells of his father&#x27;s death. The album also includes &quot;The Accrington Pals&quot; and cover versions of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Factory&quot; and Eric Bogle&#x27;s &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda&quot;.

Harding composed the music scores for &quot;DangerMouse&quot;, &quot;Count Duckula&quot; (he also sang the main and end titles with Manchester native Doreen Edwards), &quot;The Reluctant Dragon&quot; and &quot;The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship&quot; for Cosgrove Hall Films.

As well as being an acclaimed musician and comedian, he wrote &quot;The Armchair Anarchist&#x27;s Almanac&quot;, a humorous A to Z book; two collections of anecdotes, jokes and songs entitled &quot;The Unluckiest Man in the World&quot; and &quot;The 14½ Pound Budgie&quot;; and a comedy/thriller/fantasy, &quot;Killer Budgies&quot;.

His other books include a series covering aspects of his interest in British folklore and history – &quot;The Little Book of the Green Man&quot;, &quot;The Little Book of Stained Glass&quot;, &quot;The Little Book of Gargoyles&quot;, and &quot;The Little Book of Misericords&quot;; and the loosely factual autobiography, &quot;You Can See the Angel&#x27;s Bum, Miss Worswick!&quot; He has also read two of his short stories for &quot;Afternoon Story&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In 1986, Harding wrote the foreword to Barry Pilton&#x27;s book, &quot;One Man and His Bog&quot;.

He made a series of fourteen short films on minority religions in England for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Heaven and Earth&quot; show. Harding has presented the annual BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, and from 1997 to 2012 he presented the weekly BBC Radio 2 flagship folk and roots programme, &quot;The Mike Harding Show&quot;. His last show was on 26 December 2012. According to Mark Radcliffe, who took over Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Folk Show&quot;, Harding had left reluctantly, stating that the BBC had &quot;sold the folk world down the river&quot;. Four days later, on 30 December 2012, Harding launched his own internet radio show, called &quot;The Mike Harding Folk Show&quot; broadcast at 5pm every Sunday and available as a podcast and on iTunes afterwards. The show went on a very short break during November and December 2017, after 252 regular weekly episodes, with a Christmas episode #253 published in December 2017 and the next episode (#254) published on 24 February 2018. Thereafter, commencing on 18 March 2018, Harding was back with a regular monthly slot. On 4 October 2022, after 309 shows, Harding announced that #309 was his final show.

Harding is a dedicated hillwalker and a former president, and now life vice president of the Ramblers&#x27; Association. He wrote, until a new format was sought for the magazine in 2008, a regular column for hiking magazine &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; and campaigned for &#x27;Right to Roam&#x27; legislation in the United Kingdom. He is one of the patrons of the Wensleydale Railway, a group set up to re-open the once mainly derelict line between Northallerton and Garsdale in Yorkshire, near where he now lives.

He is also the patron of Settle Stories, a charity based in Settle, North Yorkshire, that promotes traditional storytelling and runs the annual Settle Storytelling Festival. Harding contributed to a promotional leaflet for the Settle tourist board.

<doc id="1092610" wikidata="Q5470851" url="?curid=1092610" title="Fort Bridgewoods">
<text>The site of Fort Bridgewoods is on the outskirts of Rochester, Medway in the United Kingdom, next to the Rochester-Maidstone road (B2097). The site was acquired by the War Office in about 1860 to form part of a ring of forts protecting the Royal Dockyard at Chatham.

== Building ==
It was envisaged that the line would stretch from the River Medway to the Thames but a shortage of money meant only five of the original large works plus two small experimental earthen redoubts were built. Work, using convict labour, started 30 years later in 1890, but by that time the enemy it was supposed to repulse, France, was an ally, the new enemy was Imperial Germany.

Because of budget restraints and changing fashions in fortifications, no fixed armament was mounted; instead earthen ramps were built to enable field artillery to fire from the fort’s parapet. The fort was a radical departure from traditional design, of earth construction, with a deep dry moat designed to blend in with the line of the land. There were magazines and living quarters under the earthen walls. A new large prison was built on the hill above the nearby village of Borstal to house the workforce. It later became a prison for young offenders and gave its name to the Borstal Institution system of correction.

===Railway===
Four of the forts (Luton, Horsted, Bridgewoods and Borstal) were linked by an gauge railway to move building materials between the sites, called the Eastern Defences Railway (EDR), built by the Royal Engineers. Building materials were brought by barge up the River Medway to a quay at Borstal, then hauled up the steep scarp slope of the North Downs to the fort via a branch of the EDR. This was done using a special type of locomotive called a Handyside locomotive that could be clamped to the tracks while it hauled wagons up behind it in stages using a winch mounted on the front of the loco. The prisoners were transported along the EDR in lockable carriages, accompanied by armed warders. The railway remained in use until about 1905.

Some of the original railway lines can be seen in the cow-shed floor of the prison farm, which in a previous incarnation was the railway workshop. The line of a section of the track between Fort Bridgewood and Fort Horsted can be seen from the air (for example on Google Earth), as it curves away in a south westerly direction from the junction of City Way and Marconi Way.

== World wars ==
After completion and until the outbreak of the First World War, Fort Bridgewoods was only sporadically garrisoned. In the early years of the 20th century the Royal Engineers deliberately mined and blew up one corner of the fort during a field exercise. With repairs undertaken the fort slipped into obscurity until trials with gun laying radar were undertaken at the Fort in the late 1930s. With radar installed, Bridgewoods served as headquarters for anti-aircraft guns in the Thames Estuary with the two flanking forts of Horsted and Borstal being among the most up-to-date anti-aircraft batteries in Britain.

== Nuclear age ==
With the development of the nuclear bomb, new protected headquarters were built at Bridgewoods in the early 1950s. Shortly after completion Anti Aircraft Command was disbanded and the site used for Civil Defence preparation and training. In 1960 the protected headquarters became the regional HQ for London (south) and remained in use until the early 1970s.

In 1975 the site was sold to a property developer who quickly demolished the fort and bunker. The site remained empty for a number of years and is now a Royal Mail depot. Part of the fort is also under UK Vending Ltd, whose address is Fort Bridgewood.

<doc id="1092612" wikidata="Q7485981" url="?curid=1092612" title="Glossary of golf">
<text>The following is a glossary of the terminology currently used in the sport of golf. Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics. Old names for clubs can be found at Obsolete golf clubs.

== 0–9 ==
; 19th hole: The clubhouse bar.

== A ==





 







== B ==
; Back nine: The last nine holes of an 18-hole golf course. Playing the back nine is called &quot;heading in&quot;.
; Backspin: A backward spin that occurs when a player strikes the golf ball. The spin causes the ball to stop quickly or spin backward after landing on the green.
; Back-swing: The first part of the golf swing. The back-swing starts with the club-head immediately behind the ball and ends when the club head travels back behind the player&#x27;s head. The term &quot;take-away&quot; refers to the first part of the back-swing.
;Bag
; Ball: A small sphere used in playing golf, which is intended to be struck by a player swinging a club. Balls are usually white, covered in dimples, and made of a variety of materials.
; Ball-marker: A token or a small coin used to spot the ball&#x27;s position on the green prior to lifting it.
; Ball retriever
; Ball washer: A device found on many tees for cleaning golf balls.
; Banana-ball: The result of a severe slice that results in a trajectory in the shape of a banana. This is also referred to as an extreme slice.
; Bandit: See &quot;Sandbagger&quot;.
; Bare lie: When the ball lies directly on hard ground without any grass to buoy the ball up, (i.e.), where there is no grass creating a gap between the ball and the ground. Applicable when practicing off hard mats.
; Best ball: A form of team play using two-, three-, or four-person teams. The team score on each hole is the lowest score obtained by one of the team members. For example, if player A has a 5, player B has a 6, player C has a 4, and player D has a 5, the &quot;best ball&quot; and team score is a 4.
; Biarritz:A hole whose green incorporates a deep gulley that effectively splits the putting surface in two. Named after a famous example at &quot;Le Phare Golf Club&quot; in Biarritz, France. This original par-3 3d hole by the ocean is long built over.
; Bifurcation:A proposal under consideration since the late 2010s by the sport&#x27;s rulemaking bodies, The R&amp;A and the USGA, to create separate rules for competitive and recreational play, mostly but not entirely relating to allowed equipment.
; BIGGA: Is the professional association in the United Kingdom dealing with all matters of golf management from a greens-keeper&#x27;s viewpoint. For the U.S. equivalent, see GCSAA.
; Birdie: A hole played in one stroke under &quot;par&quot;.
; Bisque: A form of handicapping used in private match play games. The higher handicapped player is allowed to choose on which holes they receive their handicap allowance of &quot;free shots&quot;. As this is a matter of negotiation between the players involved there are many variations in the number of shots allowed and when (before the start of the round, before playing a hole, during the play of a hole, after playing a hole) the claiming of &quot;free shot&quot; is allowed. Bisque matches are not recognized by the rules of golf.
; Bite: Some players put a great deal of spin on their approach shots causing the ball to stop immediately when it hits the green. This phenomenon is referred to as biting or checking. Depending on the amount of backspin, the ball may stop advancing forward and roll back towards the player after landing. The amount of backspin imparted on the ball is greatly influenced by the ball material, quality of contact with the face of the club, and course conditions.
; Blade: (i) A type of &quot;iron&quot; where the weight is distributed evenly across the back of the club-head as opposed to mainly around the perimeter (see &quot;cavity back&quot;).(ii) A type of &quot;putter&quot; with a striking face considerably wider than the distance from the face to the rear of the club-head. (iii) a shot struck &quot;thinly&quot; with the bottom of an iron striking high up on the golf ball, causing a low trajectory shot with a lack of control.
; Blast: A bunker shot that sends the ball, and accompanying sand, (hopefully) onto the green. Also known as an &quot;explosion&quot;.
; Blind: A shot that does not allow the golfer to see where the ball will land, such as onto an elevated green from below.
; Block: A shot played severely to the right; Similar to the &quot;push&quot;.
; Bogey: A hole played one stroke over &quot;par&quot;.
;: A player whose handicap is in the range 20 to 24.
; Borrow: See &quot;break&quot;.
; Bounce: The measurement of the angle from the front edge of a club&#x27;s sole to the point that rests on the ground when addressing the ball. In discussing wedges, bounce describes a sole angle where the back edge of the sole is lower than the front edge, keeping them from digging too deep in sand or being stopped by tall grass.
; Bounce Back: Scoring a birdie or better on a hole immediately following a bogey or worse. Also see &quot;Reverse bounce back&quot;.
; Break: The tendency of a putted ball to roll left or right of a straight line.

; Bunker, Fairway: A bunker located on or in the fairway. See &quot;bunker&quot;.
; Bye: A short game played over the remaining holes when the main match finishes early because one player or team has won by a large margin. It serves the joint purpose of adding some competitive meaning to the rest of the holes and also for the losing side to attempt to regain some of the pride lost as a result of their humiliation in the main match. It is usual for the loser of the bye to buy the first drinks in the 19th hole afterwards. In this respect it is an almost direct equivalent to a beer match in cricket.

Today in professional tournaments, ball spotters are normally placed at each hole for the same purpose.
;Four-ball: In match play, a contest between two sides, each consisting of a pair of players, where every individual plays their own ball throughout. On every hole, the lower of the two partner&#x27;s scores is matched against the lower of the opposition&#x27;s scores. In stroke-play, a four-ball competition is played between several teams each consisting of 2 players, where for every hole the lower of the two partner&#x27;s scores counts toward the team&#x27;s 18 hole total. The term &quot;four-ball&quot; is an informal reference to any group of 4 players on the course.

The first player tees off, the second player hits the second shot, the first player hits the third shot, and so on until the ball is holed. Also partners alternate their tee shots, so that one member of each team will always tee-off on the odd holes and the other will tee off on the even holes. In stroke-play, a foursome competition is played between several teams each consisting of a pair of players, where partners play alternate shots until the SINGLE ball is holed. The term &quot;foursome&quot; is a common reference to any group of 4 players on the course.

They are frequently associated with gambling because money, usually small stakes, changes hands depending on which funnies occur.

== G ==
;Gimme: Refers to a putt that the other players agree can count automatically without actually being played (under the tacit assumption that the putt would not have been missed). &quot;Gimmes&quot; are not allowed by the rules in stroke play, but they are often practiced in casual matches.

Before The Masters was founded, the national amateur championships of the U.S and the UK were considered majors along with the two national opens and only Bobby Jones has ever completed a grand slam with these. A &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot; is having won each of the majors at least once, not necessarily in the same year.
;Green: The area of specially prepared grass around the hole, where putts are played.
;Green fee: The charge made for a round of golf by the course management.
;Greensomes: Is a variation of &quot;foursomes&quot;, where each side consists of 2 players. Both players play one tee-shot each from every tee. A choice is then made as to which is the more favorable of the 2 ball positions, the other ball being picked up. Thereafter the players play alternate shots. So if A&#x27;s tee-shot is selected, the playing order from the tee will be A-B-A-B etc. until the ball is holed out. If player B&#x27;s tee-shot is selected, the playing order will be B-A-B-A etc. The team with the lowest score wins the hole.
;Green in regulation (GIR): A &quot;green&quot; is considered hit &quot;in regulation&quot; if any part of the ball is touching the putting surface while the number of strokes taken is at least two fewer than par (i.e., by the first stroke on a par 3, the second stroke on a par 4, or the third stroke on a par 5).

;: A numerical measure of a golfer&#x27;s potential that is used to enable players of varying abilities to compete against one another.
;Halfway house or Halfway hut: A building, generally between the 9th and 10th holes, providing light snacks and refreshments for golfers during their round.

Indemnity insurance is often purchased to cover the cost should anyone make the hole in one. Hole in one insurance is also available for individuals to cover the cost of a round of drinks in the event of their achieving a hole in one.
;Hook: A shot that initially takes a trajectory opposite the side of the golf ball from which the player swings but eventually curves sharply back towards the player. Under normal circumstances, a hook is unintentional; however, good players can use a hook to their advantage in certain situations.
:Hooks are often called the &quot;better player&#x27;s miss&quot;, thanks to the fact that many of the game&#x27;s greatest players (Ben Hogan, for instance) have been plagued by the hook at one time or another in their careers. A shot that follows the same trajectory but to a lesser degree is referred to as a &#x27;draw&#x27;. A draw is often intentionally used by above-average players to achieve a certain type of spin. The curved shape ball-flight is the result of sideways spin.
:A draw/ hook travels further than a fade/ slice due to the fact that the closed face reduces loft and decreases backspin.
:A draw often is considered the &quot;ideal&quot; flight of the ball and implies that the spin is intentional, whereas a hook is an overly spun &quot;draw&quot; which is often a miss or out of control (unintentional).
;: The hollow part of the club-head where the shaft is attached. Hitting the ball off the hosel is known as a &quot;shank&quot;.

;LPGA: (i) A U.S.-based organization that operates the world&#x27;s most significant women&#x27;s golf tour. From its inception, it has included female club and touring professionals in its membership—unlike men&#x27;s golf in the U.S., in which club and touring professionals have been represented by different bodies since 1968.&lt;br&gt;(ii) Any of several other national organizations, modeled after the U.S. LPGA, supporting women&#x27;s professional golf.

== P ==
;Pace: The speed at which a putt must be struck to get to the hole. &quot;Pace&quot; and &quot;break&quot; are the two components of green-reading.
;Par: Standard score for a hole (defined by its length) or a course (sum of all the holes&#x27; pars).
;Penal: A type of golf hole design where the player has little choice in the shots required to make par at the hole. Failure to execute these shots successfully is punished by severe hazards. Compare with &quot;Strategic&quot;.
;Penalty area: The official term used by the Rules of Golf since their 2019 revision to refer to what was once known as a &quot;water hazard&quot;. Penalty areas are subdivided into yellow and red penalty areas, each demarcated by correspondingly colored lines and/or stakes. The type of penalty area determines how one is permitted to take relief when their ball comes to rest within them. Unlike the former &quot;water hazard&quot;, a player is now permitted to ground their club when playing a stroke from a penalty area.
;Perfect round: Having scored a birdie or better on all 18 holes of a round.
;PGA: Any Professional Golfers&#x27; Association, for example the Professional Golfers&#x27; Association of America.
;PGA Tour: The organizer of the main male professional golf tours in the United States and North America.
;PGA Tour Champions: A tour for male golfers age 50 and over, held mostly in the U.S., operated by the PGA Tour.
;Pin: Slang for &quot;flag-stick&quot;.
;Pick Up: When the golf ball is picked up before finishing the hole.
;Pin-high: Refers to a ball on the green that is positioned along an imaginary horizontal line through the hole and across the width of the green.
;Pitch: A short shot (typically from within 50 yards or meters), usually played with a higher lofted club and made using a less than full swing, that is intended to flight the ball toward a target (usually the hole) with greater accuracy than a full iron shot.
;Pitch mark: A divot on the green caused when a ball lands. Players must repair their pitch marks, usually with a tee or a &quot;divot tool&quot;.
;Play through: Permission granted by a slow-moving group of players to a faster-moving group of players to pass them on the course.
;Plugged lie: A bad lie where the ball is at least half-buried. Also known as a &quot;buried lie&quot; or in a bunker a &quot;fried egg&quot;.
;Plus handicap:A golf handicap less than zero. A &#x27;plus&#x27; handicap golfer must add their handicap to their score.
;Pop-up: A poor tee shot where the top of the club-head strikes under the ball, causing it to go straight up in the air. In addition to being bad shots, pop-ups frequently leave white scuff-marks on the top of the club-head, or dents in persimmon clubs. Also known as &quot;sky shots&quot;.
;:Ratio of ball speed divided by swing speed.
;: A &quot;Local rule&quot; that allows the ball in play to be lifted, cleaned and moved on the fairway during adverse course conditions.
; Pre-shot routine: The steps an experienced player goes through to get ready for their shot. It usually involves taking practice swings and visualizing the intended shot.

;Provisional Ball (Rule 18.3): &quot;&quot;

;Pull: A pull is a shot that unintentionally travels on a trajectory on the same side of the ball from which the player swings.
;Punch shot: A shot played with a very low trajectory, usually to avoid interference from tree branches when a player is hitting from the woods. Similar to the knock-down, it can also be used to avoid high winds. Also known as a stinger. Depending on the angle of attack upon impact, stingers can stay low or climb later in the ball flight due to the backspin caused by a steep angle of attack, typically with a low-lofted club.
;Push: A push, or block, is shot that unintentionally travels on a trajectory opposite the side of the ball from which the player swings.&lt;br&gt;In match play, the term &quot;push&quot; can also refer to when neither competitor wins the hole, though this is more commonly called a half.
;Putt: A shot played on the green, usually with a putter.
;Putting green: A practice green is a putting surface usually found close to the club house, used to warm up and practice putting.
;Putter: A special golf club with a very low loft that makes the ball roll along the green with top-spin.

== Q ==
;Q-School: &quot;Qualifying School&quot;, the qualifying tournament on several major professional tours, such as the PGA Tour, European Tour, or LPGA Tour. Q-School is a multistage tournament (four for the PGA Tour, three for the European Tour, two for the LPGA) that culminates in a week-long tournament in which a specified number of top finishers (25 plus ties in the PGA Tour, 30 plus ties in the European Tour, and exactly 20 in the LPGA) earn their &quot;Tour Cards&quot;, qualifying them for the following year&#x27;s tour. The final tournament is six rounds (108 holes) for men and five rounds (90 holes) for women. The 2012 Q-school for the 2013 PGA Tour season was the last one, as the rules of qualification for a &quot;tour card&quot; have been changed to eliminate Q-school.

== R ==
;The R&amp;A: Since 2004 the governing body of golf throughout the world except the United States and Mexico, where this responsibility rests with the United States Golf Association (USGA). It works in collaboration with national amateur and professional golf organizations in over 110 countries. The R&amp;A is a separate organisation from The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews which formerly performed this role.
;Range finder: A measuring device used to determine one&#x27;s relative distance to an object. In golf, they are most commonly used to find out how far a player is from the hole.
;Ready golf: When each player takes their shot when ready to do so instead of adhering to the rule order of farthest from the hole playing first; typically done to improve pace of play in a recreational setting.
;Redan: A hole that has a green which slopes downward and away from the point of entrance, typically the front right portion of the green, inspired by the original Redan hole on the North Berwick West Links, Scotland.
;Regulation: The standard number of strokes allowed by par for reaching the green on a given hole (one stroke on a par 3, two strokes on a par 4, and three strokes on a par 5)
;Release: (i) The point in the downswing at which the wrists uncock. A late release (creating &quot;lag&quot;) is one of the keys to a powerful swing.(ii) The forward motion of a ball played onto a green after the braking effects of backspin have ceased.
;Reverse bounce back: Scoring a bogey or worse on a hole immediately following a birdie or better. See also &quot;bounce back&quot;.
;Rough: The grass that borders the fairway, usually taller and coarser than the fairway.
;Rowan match play: A form of individual match play which can be played by three or more players.
;Rub of the green: Occurs when the ball is deflected or stopped by a third party/object, e.g. if a ball is going out of bounds and is deflected in bounds by hitting a spectator or a tree.
;Run: The distance a ball travels once it lands. The two distances of a golf shot are first its &quot;carry&quot; and then its &quot;run&quot;.
;Rutter: A small headed niblick for hitting the ball from a cart track.

== S ==
;Sandbagger: A golfer that carries a higher official handicap than their skills indicate, e.g., carries an eight, plays to a two. Sandbaggers usually artificially inflate their handicaps with the intent of winning bets on the course, a practice that most golfers consider cheating. Also known as a &quot;bandit&quot;.
;Sand save: When a player achieves par by getting up and down from a green-side bunker.
;Sand trap: See &quot;bunker&quot;. Golfers with a deep knowledge of the game rarely refer to a bunker as a sand trap.
;Sand wedge: A lofted club designed especially for playing out of a &quot;bunker&quot;. The modern sand wedge was invented by Gene Sarazen. Although sand wedges were designed for bunker shots, they are actually used for all types of shots within 100 yards (90 meters).
;Sandy (or Sandie): A score of par or better that includes a bunker shot. Sandys are counted as points in some social golf games. If a par or better is achieved after hitting two or three bunker shots on the same hole, the terms &quot;double sandy&quot; or &quot;triple sandy&quot; are used, respectively. See Funnies.
;Scotch foursomes: In scotch foursomes teams of 2 players compete against each other. Players alternate hitting the same ball. The first player tees off, the second player hits the second shot, the first player hits the third shot, and so on until the ball is holed. To this point, the definition of ‘scotch foursomes’ is the same as that of ordinary ‘foursomes’; however, players do not alternate hitting tee shots as they would in foursomes. If Player A teed off on the first hole and Player B holed the final putt, Player B would not tee off at the second, meaning that Player A could, in theory, play every tee shot on the round. The team with the lowest score wins the hole.
;Scramble: (i) When a player misses the green in regulation, but still makes par or better on a hole. Scrambling percentage is used a measure of short game proficiency. (ii) A two or four man format, similar to Best Ball, except in a scramble, each player strikes a shot, the best shot is selected, then all players play from that selected position.
;: A player whose handicap equals zero or lower. This means they can consistently shoot par or better regularly.
;Senior: Describes a competition for older golfers, or individuals who play in such competitions. In men&#x27;s professional golf, the standard lower age limit is 50. Some competitions use 45 (the Legends Tour in women&#x27;s golf) or 55 (the U.S. Senior Amateur) as the lower limit.
;Senior PGA Tour: The original name of the tour now known as PGA Tour Champions; used from 1980 through 2001.
;Shamble: A format, similar to a scramble, where every player hits from the tee, the best tee-shot is selected, and each player holes-out from the selected tee-shot.
;Shank: A shot in which the golf ball is struck by the hosel of the club and travels a relatively short distance at a severe angle to the target. A golfer who regularly hits the ball out of the hosel is said to be affected by the &quot;shanks&quot;.
; Shrimp: A severe hook, named because it resembles the shape of a shrimp.
;Shotgun start
;Shoot your (my) age: A round of 18 holes where a given player has a score equal to, or less than, their own age in years. For example, an eighty-year-old man who scores an 80 has shot his age.
;Shoot your (my) temperature: A round of 18 holes where a given player has a score equal to 98 or 99. Usually used derisively.
;Short game: Shots that take place on or near the green. Putting, chipping, pitching, and green-side bunker play are all aspects of the short game.
;Short side: To hit a shot that misses the green to the same side in which the hole is cut. This typically results in a difficult following shot with very little area on the green to land and stop the ball.
;Sit!: Telling the ball to drop softly, and not roll after landing.
;Skin: A skins game pits players in a type of match play in which each hole has a set value (usually in money or points). The player who wins the hole is said to win the &quot;skin&quot;, and whatever that skin is worth. Skins games may be more dramatic than standard match play if it is agreed by the players that holes are not halved. Then, when any two players tie on a given hole, the value of that hole is carried over and added to the value of the following hole. The more ties, the greater the value of the skin and the bigger the eventual payoff.
;Skull: To skull the ball means to contact the ball with the leading edge of the iron, often resulting in a low shot that goes further than expected with little to no spin. A skulled shot is almost always due to a mishit by the golfer. The terms &quot;blade&quot; and &quot;thin&quot; are also used interchangeably with skull.
;Slice: A shot that initially takes a trajectory on the same side of the golf ball from which the player swings but eventually curves sharply back opposite of the player. Under normal circumstances, a slice is unintentional; however, good players can use a slice to their advantage in certain situations. Slices are often the most common miss for below-average players. A shot that follows the same trajectory but to a lesser degree is referred to as a &#x27;cut&#x27; or &#x27;fade&#x27;. A cut or fade is often intentionally used by above-average players to achieve a certain type of spin. The curved shape of the ball-flight is the result of sideways spin. For that reason a &quot;slice&quot; does not refer to a putt.
;Slope rating: Slope Rating is a number, from 55 to 155, used to determine the level of difficulty of a golf course for a bogey golfer. An &quot;average&quot; course has a slope rating of 113.
;Snap hook: A severe hook that usually goes directly left as well as curving from right to left, for a right-handed golfer. A snap hook is when a severe left to right hook occurs for a left-handed golfer.
;Snowman: To score an eight on a hole is to score a snowman. So-named because an eight (8) looks similar to the body of a snowman.
;Society: An organized group of golfers, usually not affiliated with any individual golf course. Members are often drawn from the same workplace, profession, alma mater, or other association.
;: The bottom or underside of any type of golf club. It is where the club rests on the ground in playing position.
;Span: Move your marker when in the way of another persons line of putt.
;Speed: The pace of a putt. Proper &#x27;speed&#x27; of a putt will either hole the putt or leave it about 18 inches beyond the cup. Furthermore, the speed of the putt will often determine the amount of curve, or break, in a putt.
;Sprachle: Generally, this refers to playing badly. Sprachle is a Scottish term.
;Spray: To hit the ball with a grossly inconsistent direction, compared to the intended target, in a seemingly random manner.
;Stableford: A points based scoring system. The number of strokes taken on each hole relative to &quot;par&quot; translates into a set number of points, with the winner being the player who accumulates the highest number of points.
;Stimpmeter: A device used to measure the speed of &quot;putting greens&quot;.
;Strategic: A type of golf hole design where the player has a choice of shots that can be played to make par on the hole. Generally the choices that have the least chance of entering a hazard are intended to have the least chance of making par. Compare with &quot;Penal&quot;.
;Stony: An English golf term dating back to the late 1800s which means, a shot that lands close to the flagstick.
;Stroke Index: A number assigned to each hole, and printed on the score card, to indicate the holes on which handicap strokes should be taken.
;Stroke play: Style of scoring in which the player with the fewest strokes wins. Most professional tournaments are stroke play.
;Stymie: To block another player&#x27;s putting path to the hole with one&#x27;s own ball. Now an anachronism since the rules of golf permit marking the spot of the ball on the green, thus allowing the other player to putt into the hole without obstruction.
;Sunday bag: A small and lightweight golf bag. Traditionally caddies were not available on a Sunday, so the golfer would carry their clubs in such a bag. Now often used to carry a small number of clubs or when travelling to play golf when a full size bag would be unnecessary or inconvenient.
;Sunday Stick or Sabbath Stick: A golf club disguised as a walking stick for surreptitious golf on a Sunday in societies with strict observance of the sabbath.
;Sweet-spot: The location on the club-face where the optimal ball-striking results are achieved. The closer the ball is struck to the sweet-spot, the higher the power transfer ratio will be. Hitting it in the sweet-spot is also referred to as hitting it in the screws.
;Swing: The movement a golf player makes with their body and club to hit the ball. A golf swing is made up of a series of complex mechanical body movements. A perfect golf swing is regarded as the &quot;holy grail&quot; of the sport, and there are many approaches as to how to achieve &quot;perfection&quot;. Although there is only one &quot;textbook&quot; golf swing, a perfect golf swing is unique to every individual, and, in fact, it is impossible for a human to perfectly duplicate the textbook golf swing.

== T ==
;T: An abbreviation on a scoreboard for &quot;Tied&quot;, indicating that a player has the same score as another player. A scoreboard showing a T2 for example means that the player is tied for second place with one or more other players.
;Tap-in: Often called a &quot;gimme&quot;, a tap-in is a ball that has come to rest very close to the hole, leaving only a very short putt to be played. Often, recreational golfers will &quot;concede&quot; tap-ins to each other to save time.
;Target-line: The target line is the straight line from the ball to its intended target. It is also extended backward.
;Tee: A small peg, usually made of wood or plastic, placed in the ground upon which the golf ball may be placed prior to the first stroke on a hole. May also refer to the &quot;teeing ground&quot;.
;Teeing ground:The area from which you hit your drive or tee shot. The teeing ground for a particular set of tees is two club lengths in depth. The ball must be teed between the markers, called tees, that define the teeing ground&#x27;s width, and no further back than its depth. Tees are colored, but there is no standard for colors. The &quot;teeing ground&quot; refers to one set of tees. Most courses have at least three sets of tees; some have more than twice that many. The areas where tee markers are placed are called &quot;tee boxes&quot;.
;Tempo: The smooth change of the speed of a player&#x27;s swing from first movement, through the ball strike, to the follow-through.
; Ten-finger grip: Grip style with all ten fingers on the club. Also known as the &quot;baseball grip&quot;.
;Texas wedge: Using a putter anywhere outside of the green.
;Thin shot: Usually, an unintentional, poor shot where the club-head strikes too high on the ball. When taken to an extreme but still at or below the center-line of the ball, it is known &quot;blading&quot; the ball. Sometimes, when the ball is lying a certain way around the green, advanced players will intentionally hit a thin shot to achieve certain results.
;Through line: When putting, the imaginary path that a ball would travel on if the putted ball goes past the hole. Usually observed by PGA players and knowledgeable golfers when retrieving or marking a ball around the hole.
;Through the green: The entire area of the golf course, except for the teeing ground of the hole being played, the green of the hole being played and all hazards on the course.
;Tiger Slam: Winning four consecutive major championships but not in a calendar year. Coined when Tiger Woods won the last three majors in 2000, followed by the 2001 Masters.
;Tips: The championship tees on a golf course are known as &quot;the tips&quot;.
;Toe: The far end of the club-head (farthest from the hosel).
;Topped: An errant shot where the club-head strikes on top of the ball, causing the ball to roll or bounce rather than fly.
;Tree shot: A bad shot that has hit the trees&#x27; leaves, branches, and/or trunk and has resulted in a negative situation, i.e., going out of bounds, into a hazard, or leaving the ball much shorter than anticipated.
;Triple bogey: A hole played three strokes over par.
;Trolley: A cart designed for transporting a golf bag, complete with clubs and other golf equipment around the golf course. 
;Turkey: Three consecutive birdies during one round of golf.

== U ==
;Unplayable: A player can declare their ball unplayable at any time when it is in play (other than at a tee), and can drop the ball either within two club-lengths, or further from the hole in line with the hole and its current position, or where they played their last shot. A penalty of one stroke is applied.
;Up and down or up and in: The situation where a player holes the ball in two strokes starting from off the green. The first stroke, usually a &quot;pitch&quot;, a &quot;bunker shot&quot; or a &quot;chip&quot;, gets the ball &quot;up&quot; onto the green, and the subsequent putt gets the ball &quot;down&quot; into the hole.
;USGA: The governing body of golf for the U.S. and Mexico. Together with The R&amp;A, the USGA produces and interprets the Rules of Golf.
;USPGA: The principal organization for golf professionals in the United States. More commonly called the &quot;PGA of America&quot;.

== V ==
;Vardon grip: A common grip style in which (for right-handed players) the right pinkie finger rests on top of the left index finger. Also known as the &quot;overlapping grip&quot;, it is named for Harry Vardon, a champion golfer of the early 20th century.
;Vaulting dormie: A possible occurrence in &quot;match play&quot; when a player or team converts a lead into a victory without passing through &quot;dormie&quot;, a guaranteed minimum of a tie at the end of regulation play—for example, converting an 8-hole lead with nine to play into a 9-hole lead with eight to play, or converting a 1-hole lead with two to play into a 2-hole lead with one to play.

== W ==
;Waggle: A pre-shot routine where a player adjusts their body, the club, and/or practice swings at the ball.
;We Are Golf: A coalition formed by the Club Managers Association of America, the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America, the National Golf Course Owners Association, and The PGA of America to highlight the economic and social impacts of the game of golf.
;Wedge: A type of golf club; a subset of &quot;iron&quot; designed for short range strokes. Of all the categories of clubs, wedges have faces with the highest degrees of loft.
;Whiff: An attempt to strike the ball where the player fails to make contact with the ball. A whiff must be counted as a stroke.
;Winter green: Typically an area of fairway used as a temporary putting green to prevent damage to the normal green during inclement winter weather. On some courses, particularly in Japan, holes are built with two greens with different varieties of grass, one for summer play, the other for winter.
;Winter rules: See &quot;Preferred lies&quot;
;Wire-to-wire: Leading a tournament after every round (may or may not include ties).
;Wood: A type of club where the head is generally (except for the club-face) bulbous in shape; so named because the head was originally made of wood, although almost all are now metal. Of all the categories of long hitting clubs, woods have faces with the lowest degrees of loft. Only putters are lower lofted, generally only 2-4 degrees, whereas drivers typically have 8-14 degrees loft.
;Worm burner: A shot that is hit remarkably low and sometimes hard.

== Y ==
;Yardage: Distance (in yards) to target
;Yips: A tendency to twitch during the golf stroke. Some top golfers have had their careers greatly affected or even destroyed by the yips; prominent golfers who battled with the yips for much of their careers include Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, and, more recently, Bernhard Langer.

== Z ==
; Zinger: A ball hit high and hard close to the leading edge, causing a low flight and a slight vibratory feel.

<text>Malaysian television broadcasting was introduced on 28 December 1963. Colour television was introduced on 28 December 1978. Full-time colour transmissions were officially inaugurated on New Year&#x27;s Day 1982. There are currently 16 national free-to-air terrestrial television channels in Malaysia and 3 national pay subscription television operators in Malaysia.

== Broadcasting ==
Transmissions in Malaysia were black-and-white until 28 December 1978, when colour transmissions were introduced. First stereo audio broadcasting was introduced in 1985 by TV3. Five out of eight channels do not have 24-hour schedule. 24-hour television was introduced in Malaysia between 13 and 16 May 1989 on TV1. The first 24-hour broadcasting in Malaysia was introduced in 1997 by TV3, but was discontinued later due to energy-saving plan (see below). Since April 2006, TV2 broadcast round-the-clock followed by TV1, which began broadcasting 24 hours in August 2012 after having short-lived round-the-clock broadcast previously.

== Television providers ==
Subscription providers are available, with differences in the number of channels, capabilities such as the programme guide (EPG), video on demand (VOD), high-definition (HD), interactive television via the red button, and coverage across Malaysia. Set-top boxes are generally used to receive these services. Households viewing TV from the internet also tracked by the Malaysian government.

== Analogue terrestrial television ==
This was the traditional way of receiving television in Malaysia, however it is being supplanted by digital providers. There are eight channels; three of them are government public-owned by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM). The three television channels are terrestrial free-to-air TV1, TV2 and Okey (formerly TVi). TV Alhijrah is owned by Alhijrah Media Corporation while TV3, NTV7, 8TV and TV9 are private and commercially owned by Media Prima. Worldview Broadcasting Channel was commercial-owned by Worldview Broadcasting Channel (M) Sdn Bhd. It has since closed down in October 2012 after they were unable to operate the channel due to financial difficulties. Analogue terrestrial transmissions were scheduled to be switched off in phases as part of the digital switchover, expected to be completed in 2020 as a recommendation from Southeast Asia. On 31 December 2018, digital television consortium MYTV Broadcasting scheduled the switchoff on third quarter 2019, to allow a period of digital set-top box distribution to eligible viewers with low income. The frequency has been moved to avoid signal jamming with television in Thailand and preventing Singaporeans from watching foreign-copyrighted programming, especially that contains Chinese dialects (mainly in Cantonese and Hokkien) on free-to-air, due to tight censorship currently in place in Singapore. The analogue were indefinitely switched off nationwide on 31 October 2019.

== Digital terrestrial television ==
In 2005, the Ministry of Information announced their plan to digitalise nationwide free-to-air TV broadcasts led by Radio Televisyen Malaysia (RTM). Trial broadcasts were undertaken, involving one thousand households in the Klang Valley from September 2006 till February 2007. According to the then-Deputy Minister of Information, Chia Kwang Chye, the trial received &quot;very positive&quot; feedback, i.e. &quot;more than 60 percent said the quality of the signal ranged from good to very good. Over 88 percent said the picture quality improved, while 70 percent said the sound quality was better&quot;.

On 1 January 2008, TV3 announced that they were carrying out their own tests using a completely different system, T-DMB. However their test transmission is available only to areas surrounding their main headquarters at Sri Pentas, Bandar Utama, Petaling Jaya. The test signals consists of a single DAB stream, Fly FM, and two T-DMB streams, TV3 and a Hot Visual, which carries a slide show with audio signal streamed from the radio station Hot FM.

Despite a success of RTM&#x27;s pilot trials, the digital terrestrial television transition faced many problems. These problems stemmed from the lesser enthusiasm of content providers toward the digitisation, with the exception of Les Copaque, and the need to improve the nation&#x27;s Internet broadband infrastructure. With the resignation of then Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi and the succession of Najib Tun Razak, the project by RTM was deferred indefinitely.

The advent of digital television has facilitiated Malaysia&#x27;s constituent regions to launch their own public broadcasters: Sarawak&#x27;s state government officially launched TVS in October 2020 after a 6-year trial period since 2014, Sabah followed suit launching the TV Sabah mobile streaming service in April 2023 with plans to establish its own station more than 40 years after the dissolving of its previous incarnation under RTM&#x27;s Third Network in 1984.

== Satellite television ==
Malaysia&#x27;s sole satellite television operator, MEASAT Broadcast Network Systems (a subsidiary of Astro Malaysia Holdings) launched the Astro service in launch of the MEASAT-1 satellite as part of Malaysia&#x27;s commercialisation of space, Astro commenced broadcasting on 1 June 1996 with an initial offering of 3 radio stations and 22 television channels. Today, Astro has over 160 TV channels and Radio Stations, as well as 25 HD channels. They have also started their IPTV service in 2013.

===Television===
It currently holds exclusive rights from the Malaysian government to offer satellite television broadcasting services in the country through the year 2017. The rights was extended to 2022 recently. However, today Astro contains more than 100 channels including local and international channels and radio channels.

There are also laws preventing too many advertisements from being aired on both radio and television, similar to the United Kingdom.

In December 2011, former prime minister Najib Tun Razak announced that the free-to-view satellite television service by Astro, NJOI, will be made available from February 2012 onwards.

== Cable TV ==
Mega TV was launched in 1995 by TV3 as the only cable television service. However, it faced stiff competition from the satellite television network Astro, and failed to expand its content. Because of this, it closed down in 2001, and was replaced by its competitor since then. In 2013, ABN Networks launched their Cable TV service together with Fiber Optic Internet as ABNXcess yet the network also failed to compete with Astro.

== Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) ==
In contrast to Internet TV, Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) refers to services operated and controlled by a single company, who may also control the &#x27;Final Mile&#x27; to the consumers&#x27; premises.

DETV, a new paid television provider owned by REDtone, provides television and video-on-demand services on the IPTV platform, targeting the Chinese audiences in Malaysia.

However, Astro is the first broadcast company in Malaysia that introduce the IPTV services, branded as Astro IPTV in collaboration with Maxis Communications and TIME dotCom.

After that, Telekom Malaysia (TM) launched its IPTV services, currently branded as HyppTV in the second quarter of 2009, and now conducts trials with 1,000 selected households in Klang Valley, Penang and Kulim, Kedah.

TM then successfully released their IPTV based on their HSBB Unifi service which only available to Unifi subscriber through nationwide. Collaboration with Astro stopped on 1 August 2016 with termination of both Astro Supersports HD and Astro Supersports 2 HD. HyppTV is rebranded as Unifi TV starting from 12 January 2018.

== Mobile TV ==
Maxis, DiGi and U Mobile provide mobile television services for reception on third generation mobile phones. They consist of a mixture of regular channels as well as made for mobile channels with looped content. Maxis TV now offers more than 20 channels to Maxis 3G subscribers who own compatible mobile phones. Yet, Maxis is expected to roll out broadcast mobile TV services based on DVB-H in the near future.

U Mobile also provides broadcast mobile TV to users of selected 3G phones, also based on DVB-H.

In October 2008, Astro launched Astro Mobile TV which currently provides 18 channels, all of which are mobile versions of its existing channels, seven of them are under its own brand. This service is only available to Maxis subscribers with compatible 2.5G or 3G handsets, and does not reprise its role from Maxis TV.

=== Live streaming ===
Television received via the Internet may be free, subscription or pay-per-view, multicast, unicast, or peer-to-peer, streamed or downloaded, and use a variety of distribution technologies. Playback is normally via a computer and broadband Internet connection, although digital media receivers or media centre computers can be used for playback on televisions, such as a computer equipped with Windows Media Center.

<doc id="1092645" wikidata="Q1350376" url="?curid=1092645" title="Result (cricket)">
<text>The result in a game of cricket may be a &quot;win&quot; for one of the two teams playing, or a &quot;tie&quot;. In the case of a limited overs game, the game can also end with &quot;no result&quot; if the game can&#x27;t be finished on time (usually due to weather or bad light), and in other forms of cricket, a &quot;draw&quot; may be possible. Which of these results applies, and how the result is expressed, is governed by Law 16 of the laws of cricket.

==Win and loss==
The result of a match is a &quot;win&quot; when one side scores more runs than the opposing side and all the innings of the team that has fewer runs have been completed.
The side scoring more runs has &quot;won&quot; the game, and the side scoring fewer has &quot;lost&quot;. If the match ends without all the innings being completed, the result may be a draw or no result.

==Results where neither team wins==
===Tie===

The result of a match is a &quot;tie&quot; when the scores are equal at the conclusion of play, but only if the side batting last has completed its innings (i.e. all innings are completed, or, in limited-overs cricket, the set number of overs has been played or play is terminally stopped by weather or bad light).

This is unusual in Test cricket: only two tied Tests have ever occurred.

====Tiebreakers====
In some forms of one-day cricket, such as Twenty20, a Super Over or a bowl-out is sometimes used as a tiebreaker to decide a result that would otherwise be a tie. In such cases, the result of the match is recorded in official statistics as Tie+W or Tie+L to indicate matches tied and then won or lost in the tiebreaker.

=== Draw===

The result of a match is a &quot;draw&quot; if a match is concluded, as defined in Law 16, without being a win or a tie. A draw therefore occurs when one or both of the teams have not completed their innings by the scheduled end of play. In matches where the number of overs is not limited, therefore, a team unable to win may be able to &#x27;save the draw&#x27; by either avoiding being all-out if they are batting (i.e. by having two or more batsmen left at the end of play who are &#x27;not out&#x27;), or, if bowling, by slowing down the scoring of the batting team. The match is then drawn regardless of the total of runs accumulated by either side. Some league competitions allow for a &quot;winning draw&quot; (and therefore also a &quot;losing draw&quot;), allocating more points to one of the teams based on factors such as run rates or overall runs scored. The official result is still a draw.

===No result===
A &quot;no result&quot; is recorded if a limited over match which has been started cannot be completed, which usually occurs if weather or light interrupts play. In the case of rain playing a factor, this is often known as the match being &quot;washed out&quot;. The result is effectively the same as a draw.

Limited overs cricket formats require that each team has to have the opportunity bat for a minimum number of overs in order for a result to be possible: 20 overs in One Day International cricket and five overs in Twenty20 cricket.

If each team is able to face at least this number of overs, a result is possible and can be calculated using the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method or other competition rules.

====Abandoned====
A match can be &quot;abandoned&quot; or &quot;cancelled&quot; if weather or other conditions prevent any play from occurring at all. If the bowler of the first over of play has not started his/her runup when the officials decide to abandon play then the result is termed &#x27;abandoned without a ball being bowled&#x27;. Such a game is not included in official statistical records.

Before July 2004, the same result occurred if the toss had been taken but the match was abandoned before a ball was bowled. Since 2004, the International Cricket Council for International matches has decreed that a match where the toss takes place but which is abandoned without a ball being bowled is either a draw or (for a limited-overs match) a no result. Such games are now included in statistical records, counting, for example, as a game played by the teams and nominated players.

==Rare results==
===Awarded===
The umpires also have the power to &quot;award&quot; a match to one side where the other side either concedes defeat or in the opinion of the umpires refuses to play, in which case the game can be deemed to have been forfeited by the side in question. (Note that this is not the same as the (voluntary) forfeiture of an innings under Law 15.) This power is very rarely used. Before this rule was introduced there had been cases in the international arena where one team has refused to play, or deliberately stopped playing for a while. One notable incident was when Sri Lanka temporarily stopped play during a match in January 1999 against England when Muttiah Muralitharan was called for throwing by umpire Ross Emerson (Muralitharan having previously been called for throwing by another umpire Darrell Hair in previous fixtures). A similar case occurred in the Sydney Test in 1971, when umpires came close to awarding the match to Australia after England players withdrew during crowd disturbances.

The only time that a Test match has been won in this manner is when umpires Darrell Hair and Billy Doctrove awarded England the Fourth Test against Pakistan on 20 August 2006 after Pakistan refused to take the field at the scheduled time after tea on the fourth day. This was because Hair alleged that Pakistani bowlers tampered with the ball. He did not name a player involved in the incident. Later during the ICC general body meeting in 2008, the result was changed to &quot;match drawn&quot;, and then in February 2009 changed back to an England win.

In one-day international cricket, on 3 November 1978, Pakistan were awarded the third ODI against India when India conceded the match in protest against short-pitched bowling. 

On 13 March 1996, in a World Cup semi-final held in India, Sri Lanka were awarded the match against India by default when crowd disturbances made it impossible for the game to continue. Sri Lanka were well ahead of India at the time. 

===Conceded===
Law 16 allows a team to concede a match. This seldom happens, but it covers the situation where the scoreboard has in good faith displayed an incorrect score which is accepted by the &quot;losing&quot; team, who leave the field, thereby conceding the match to the opposition.

==Statement of result==

The result of a cricket match is stated in several ways.

If the side batting last wins the match without losing all its wickets, the result shall be stated as a win by the number of wickets still then to fall. For example, in a single-innings match, if Team A bat first and make 200 runs, then Team B make 201 after losing four wickets out of ten, Team B is said to have &quot;won by six wickets&quot;, regardless of how many batsmen Team A lost during their innings.

If the side fielding last wins the match, the result shall be stated as a win by runs. For instance, if Team A bat first and make 200 runs, but Team B make only 192, Team A is said to have &quot;won by eight runs&quot;.

If the side batting last has lost all its wickets, but as the result of an award of 5 penalty runs at the end of the match has scored a total of runs in excess of the total scored by the opposing side, the result shall be stated as a win to that side by penalty runs.

In a two-innings match, if the number of runs scored in its first innings by the side due to bat last is greater than the total runs scored by the opposition in both its innings, the result is stated as a win by an innings and number of runs short. Here &quot;due to bat last&quot; includes a team who batted first, but forced their opponent to follow-on (bat consecutive innings). If Team A bat first and make 200 runs in their first innings, Team B make 300 runs in their first innings, and Team A only make 95 runs in their second innings, Team B is said to have &quot;won by an innings and five runs&quot;.

If the match is decided by one side conceding defeat or refusing to play, the result shall be stated as &quot;Match Conceded&quot; or &quot;Match Awarded&quot;.

If a match is unfinished when time expires, the result is a &quot;draw&quot; (this does not apply to limited overs cricket, where this is considered to be &quot;no result&quot;). If all innings of both teams are completed (either because all batsmen have been dismissed or one/more innings are completed by way of a declaration) &quot;and&quot; the totals are exactly equal, the match is a &quot;tie&quot;.

<text>An adult high school or adult school is a high school facility designed for adult education. It is intended for adults who have not completed high school to continue their education. Some adult high schools offer child care, special integration programs for immigrants and refugees, career and other programs and services geared toward the special needs of adult students. Some adult high schools may also offer general interest programs such as computer skills or other continuing education courses.
==History==
Samuel Fox is credited with helping William Singleton to start the first &quot;Adult School&quot; in Nottingham, England in 1798. Initially, the classes were for young women from local lace and hosiery factories. William Singleton, a Methodist, started the school, but it was Fox and the staff from his grocer shop that maintained it. Fox&#x27;s staff was expected to teach at this school and Fox provided breakfast at 9 a.m. on a Sunday after they had completed two hours of teaching. The school grew to include men, but it was said that Fox was specifically interested in improving adult education. Lessons are believed to have started with a Bible reading, but the book was then used as a textbook to enable scholars to practise reading and writing. Fox conducted lessons for three mornings a week for students of more advanced arithmetic and he would fund some to go to become teachers themselves.

<text>Hugh Mercer (January 16, 1726 – January 12, 1777) was a Scottish brigadier general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He fought in the New York and New Jersey campaign and was mortally wounded at the Battle of Princeton.

He was born in Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen. He served as an assistant surgeon in Charles Edward Stuart&#x27;s army during the Battle of Culloden in the Jacobite rising of 1745.

After the failed uprising, Mercer escaped to the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, where he lived in Greencastle, Pennsylvania, which is present-day Mercersburg, Pennsylvania, and Fredericksburg, Virginia. He worked as a physician, and established an apothecary. He served alongside George Washington in the provincial troops during the French and Indian War, and he and Washington became close friends.

==Early life and education==
Mercer was born on January 16, 1726, in Pitsligo, Aberdeenshire, Scotland to Ann Monro and the Reverend William Mercer, a minister in the Church of Scotland.

At age 15, he began studying medicine at the University of Aberdeen&#x27;s Marischal College, and graduated as a physician in 1744. He served as an assistant surgeon in the army of Charles Edward Stuart during the Jacobite rising of 1745, and was present at the Battle of Culloden when Charles&#x27; army was defeated on 16 April 1746.

As a fugitive in his homeland in 1747, Mercer fled Scotland after months in hiding. In the fall of 1746, he departed Leith by ship and sailed to Philadelphia. He settled in Pennsylvaniva near Greencastle, now known as Mercersburg, and practiced medicine as a physician and apothecary for eight years.

==French and Indian War==

After the French and Indian War broke out in 1754, Mercer joined the Pennsylvania Provincial Forces. In 1755, Mercer served as a captain in General Edward Braddock&#x27;s army in his failed attempt to take Fort Duquesne. He was wounded in the arm during the battle and left behind in the scramble to retreat. He was able to rejoin his troops and continued to treat wounded soldiers. In March 1756, he was commissioned a captain in a Pennsylvania regiment, and took command of Fort Shirley. He accompanied Lt. Col. John Armstrong in the Kittanning Expedition in September 1756.

In the fighting at Kittanning, Mercer was badly wounded and separated from his unit. He trekked through the woods for 14 days, injured and with no supplies, before he &quot;lay down, giving up all hopes of ever getting home.&quot; A &quot;company of Cherokee Indians in kings pay&quot; found him and carried him to Fort Lyttleton, where he recovered. In 1757, he was placed in charge of the garrison at Fort Morris in Shippensburg and promoted to Major. It was during this period that Mercer developed a lifelong friendship with George Washington.

Both Washington and Mercer served in the Forbes Expedition under British General John Forbes during the second attempt to capture Fort Duquesne. Forbes occupied the burned fort on 25 November 1758. Forbes immediately ordered the construction of a new fortification to be named Fort Pitt, after British Secretary of State William Pitt the Elder. He also named the settlement between the rivers &quot;Pittsborough&quot;, modern Pittsburgh. Mercer built a temporary fort during construction of Fort Pitt, informally known as &quot;Mercer&#x27;s Fort&quot;. It was dismantled in 1760.

==American Revolution==

At the recommendation of Washington, Mercer moved to Fredericksburg, Virginia in 1760 to practice medicine after the war. He befriended another Scottish expatriate, John Paul Jones. Mercer became a noted member and businessman in town, buying land and involving himself in local trade. He married Isabella Gordon and started a family.

He became a member of the Fredericksburg Masonic Lodge in 1767. Washington, who was also a member of this lodge, later became president, and at least eight members were generals of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War: Washington, Mercer, George Weedon, William Woodford, Fielding Lewis, Thomas Posey, Gustavus Wallace, and the Marquis de Lafayette, who named an honorary general in 1824, far more than any other group, institution, or organization during the Revolutionary War. The lodge is still in existence today.

Soon after, Mercer opened a physician&#x27;s apothecary and practice. His apothecary in Fredericksburg, Virginia is now a museum. George Washington&#x27;s mother, Mary Washington, became one of Mercer&#x27;s patients, and Mercer prospered as a respected doctor in the area. Mercer married Isabella Gordon and together they had five children: Ann Mercer Patton, John Mercer, William Mercer, George Weedon Mercer, and Hugh Tennant Mercer.

In 1774, George Washington sold Ferry Farm, his childhood home, to Mercer, who wanted to make this prized land into a town where he and his family would settle for the remainder of his days.

During 1775, Mercer was a member of the Fredericksburg Committee of Safety, and on April 25, he was one of the members of the Independent Company of the Town of Fredericksburg who sent a letter of concern to then Colonel George Washington when the British removed gunpowder from the magazine at Williamsburg. In an August vote, Mercer was excluded from the elected leadership of the new regiments formed by the Virginia Convention because he was a &quot;northern Briton&quot;, but on 12 September, he was elected Colonel of the Minute Men of Spotsylvania, King George, Stafford, and Caroline Counties.

On November 17, 1775, Mercer was one of 21 members chosen for the Committee of Safety for Spotsylvania County. On January 10, 1776, Mercer was appointed colonel to what soon became the 3rd Virginia Regiment of the Virginia Line, and the next day, George Weedon was appointed lieutenant colonel. Future president James Monroe and future Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall also served as officers under his command.

===American Revolutionary War===
On June 5, 1776, Mercer received a letter from the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia, signed by John Hancock, appointing him brigadier-general in the Armies of the United Colonies and requesting him to report to headquarters in New York immediately.

Mercer was placed in charge of a large troop of Pennsylvania Militia stationed in Paulus Hook, New Jersey to protect from potential attack from British troops in Staten Island.

Before the New York City Campaign, Washington had ordered two forts built to repel the Royal Navy. On the New York side of the Hudson River, Fort Washington was constructed, and Mercer himself oversaw the building of the earthen fortification on the New Jersey side, named Fort Lee. The British captured Fort Washington on 16 November 1776, and the Americans abandoned Fort Lee four days later. The retreat to New Jersey became known as &quot;the Crisis of the Revolution&quot;, because the enlistments of most of Washington&#x27;s soldiers ended on New Year&#x27;s Day 1777.

Mercer led a raid on Richmondtown, Staten Island on October 15, 1776, temporarily securing the town and taking as prisoners those inside the makeshift hospital of St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, but was repelled back to New Jersey, releasing the prisoners and causing numerous British casualties in the process.

Some historical accounts credit Mercer with the suggestion for George Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River, which resulted in a surprise attack on the Hessians at the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776. The victory at Trenton (and a small monetary bonus) made Washington&#x27;s men agree to a ten-day extension to their enlistment. When Washington decided to face off with Cornwallis during the Second Battle of Trenton on January 2, 1777, Mercer was given a major role in the defense of the city.

===Death===


The next day, January 3, 1777, Washington&#x27;s army was en route to the Battle of Princeton. While leading a vanguard of 350 soldiers, Mercer&#x27;s brigade encountered two British regiments and a mounted unit. A fight broke out at an orchard grove and Mercer&#x27;s horse was shot from under him. Getting to his feet, he was quickly surrounded by British troops who mistook him for George Washington and ordered him to surrender. Outnumbered, he drew his saber and began an unequal contest. He was finally beaten to the ground, bayoneted seven times, and left for dead.

When he learned of the British attack and saw some of Mercer&#x27;s men in retreat, Washington himself entered the fray. Washington rallied Mercer&#x27;s men and pushed back the British regiments, but Mercer had been left on the field to die with multiple bayonet wounds to his body and blows to his head. Legend has it that a beaten Mercer, with a bayonet still impaled in him, did not want to leave his men and the battle and was given a place to rest on a white oak tree&#x27;s trunk, and those who remained with him stood their ground. The tree became known as &quot;the Mercer Oak&quot; and is the key element of the seal of Mercer County, New Jersey.

When he was found, Mercer was carried to the field hospital in the Thomas Clarke House, now a museum. at the eastern end of the battlefield. Benjamin Rush cared for Mercer and other wounded troops. Rush was assisted in caring for the wounded by Quakers.

Local Quakers continued to care for wounded troops from both Continental and British forces, after the Continental Army moved North. The Quaker meeting house is adjacent to the property now known as Princeton Battlefield State Park. Medical efforts were made by Rush to save Mercer, but he was mortally wounded and died nine days later, on January 12, 1777.

====Interment====
Mercer was initially interred in the Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia. In 1840, he was reinterred in Laurel Hill Cemetery, including a memorial monument funded by the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Society.

Because of Mercer&#x27;s courage and sacrifice, Washington proceeded into Princeton, where he and the Continental Army defeated British forces in the Battle of Princeton. Washington then moved and quartered his forces in Morristown following the victory. Because of those victories, most of Washington&#x27;s army re-enlisted, the French finally approved arms and supplies to the Americans, and a stunned Cornwallis pulled his forces back to New York to reassess the surprising military victories by Washington and his Continental Army. The crisis ended, demonstrating that Washington and his army had the means to fight, and British public support for continued engagement in the war began waning.

John Trumbull used Mercer&#x27;s son, Hugh Jr., as a model for his portrait &quot;The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777&quot;.

A second portrait by Charles Willson Peale, &quot;Washington at the Battle of Princeton, January 3, 1777&quot;, displays Washington in the foreground with Hugh Mercer lying mortally wounded in the background, supported by Dr. Benjamin Rush and Major George Lewis holding the American flag. This portrait is the prize possession of Princeton University. Peale painted a version of &quot;Battle of Princeton&quot;, whose background shows a very indistinct portrait of Mercer being helped from the ground.

==Family==
Succeeding generations of Mercer&#x27;s family have distinguished themselves. Famous direct descendants of Hugh Mercer were his grandson Virginia governor John Mercer Patton, his sons Confederate Lt. Col Waller T. Patton and Col. George Smith Patton, who in turn was an ancestor of General George S. Patton, Jr. Other direct descendants include another grandson Confederate General Hugh Weedon Mercer (CSA), songwriter Johnny Mercer, and Sergeant Christopher Mercer Lowe of the U.S. Army.

<doc id="1092669" wikidata="Q6143078" url="?curid=1092669" title="USS Pogy (SS-266)">
<text>USS &quot;Pogy&quot; (SS-266), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pogy, or menhaden. She was credited with sinking 16 ships totaling 62,633 gross register tons during World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pogy&quot; (SS–266) was laid down 15 September 1941 by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co., Manitowoc, Wisc., launched 23 June 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Julius A. Furer; and commissioned 10 January 1943. &quot;Pogy&quot; temporarily decommissioned 1 February for a Mississippi River cruise on a river barge to New Orleans, LA, and recommissioned upon her arrival 12 February.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
====First war patrol, April – June 1943====
After fitting out, trial runs, and training, &quot;Pogy&quot; arrived Pearl Harbor 5 April 1943. On 15 April she set out for her patrol area along the eastern coast of Honshū, making her first contact 1 May. Her periscope attack on a convoy of five ships with one escort sank ex-gunboat &quot;Keishin Maru&quot;, and damaged a small cargo ship. Upon surfacing that night, &quot;Pogy&quot; attacked a destroyer with three torpedoes, but was unable to observe the results. The next day she destroyed a large sampan by gunfire. On 9 May while making a submerged attack on a convoy of four cargo ships, a bomb close astern forced &quot;Pogy&quot; to retire. On 11 May, she sank a 100-ton sampan by gunfire. Two torpedo hits sank a small cargo ship 26 May, and on 5 June &quot;Pogy&quot; retired to Midway.

====Second war patrol, June – August 1943====
She departed Midway on her second war patrol 26 June. Throughout July she covered the Empire-Truk main communication and supply line. While patrolling submerged east of the Pulap Islands 5 July, she attacked two cargo ships with torpedoes, damaging the leading 3,000-ton cargo ship by one hit.

&quot;Pogy&quot; sighted an aircraft ferry steaming for Truk, and sank the 7,497-ton &quot;Mongamigawa Maru&quot; and her valuable cargo 1 August. The submarine then departed the area, stopping at Johnston Island for fuel on the 14th, and arriving at Pearl Harbor two days later for refit.

====Third and fourth war patrols, September – December 1943====
&quot;Pogy&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 9 September for her third war patrol, in the Palau area. On 28 September she sighted a five ship convoy. After a two-day chase and one unsuccessful attack, she scored two torpedo hits on the largest cargo ship of the convoy, &quot;Maebashi Maru&quot;, sinking 7,000 more tons of enemy shipping. On 6 October &quot;Pogy&quot; fired and missed with 4 torpedoes at &quot;Nichiei Maru&quot;. On 26 October &quot;Pogy&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor.

The submarine sailed for her patrol area again in the Palau Islands on 25 November. En route, on 7 December, she sighted a large cargo ship and a submarine tender escorted by a destroyer. In the ensuing attack three torpedoes hit and sank the 6,081-ton submarine tender, and one hit the cargo ship, before &quot;Pogy&quot; went deep to sit out an attack of 22 depth charges. She surfaced in the darkness to find the cargo ship dead in the water with the destroyer circling her. &quot;Pogy&quot; launched two torpedoes, both hits.

On 13 December &quot;Pogy&quot; sank 3,821-ton transport &quot;Fukkai Maru&quot; leaving Palau loaded with troops. The angry escort dropped 27 depth charges during the counter-attack, the three closest charges causing damage which forced &quot;Pogy&quot; to return to Midway on 22 December.

====Fifth war patrol, February – March 1944====
On 5 February 1944 &quot;Pogy&quot; departed Midway on her fifth war patrol for an anti-shipping sweep of the Formosa area. During the morning of 10 February, she spotted a convoy in Bashi Channel, off the southern tip of Formosa, guarded by three Japanese destroyers. &quot;Pogy&quot; attacked with five torpedoes, sinking the and 5,500-ton passenger-cargo ship &quot;Malta Maru&quot;, and damaging another cargo ship.
&quot;Pogy&quot; then headed north up the east coast of Taiwan and, on 20 February, caught a convoy on the Tropic of Cancer. She sank the 5,154-ton cargo ship &quot;Taizin Maru&quot; with two torpedoes and the 3,610-ton cargo ship &quot;Nanyo Maru&quot; with one. Three days later in Ryukyu waters, &quot;Pogy&quot; sank another cargo ship, before heading for Pearl Harbor, arriving 8 March 1944.

====Sixth war patrol, April – June 1944====
On 7 April 1944 she departed on her sixth patrol, southeast of Japan. The night of 28–29 April, &quot;Pogy&quot; sighted and sank the Japanese submarine . She then attacked and sank a cargo ship on 5 May, and a medium cargo ship on 13 May.

Three days later &quot;Pogy&quot; sank a 20-ton sampan by gunfire, and captured five of her crew. On 20 May, &quot;Pogy&quot; destroyed a small trawler and arrived back in Pearl Harbor 29 May. She departed Pearl Harbor 1 June for a West Coast navy yard overhaul, arriving at Hunter&#x27;s Point Naval Shipyard, San Francisco. 8 June. &quot;Pogy&quot; left for Pearl Harbor 17 September.

====Seventh and eighth war patrols, October 1944 – February 1945====
After a training period, she got underway 13 October for her seventh war patrol, in the Ryukyu (&quot;Nansei&quot;) islands and waters south of Japan, but made no contacts before returning to Midway 2 December.

On 27 December &quot;Pogy&quot; sailed on her eighth patrol in the Bonin and Volcano Islands. On 14 January 1945 she made an unsuccessful torpedo attack on a convoy of three cargo ships. No other opportunity to attack presented itself during the patrol, and the ship returned to Midway 11 February.

====Ninth war patrol, March – May 1945====
On 12 March 1945 &quot;Pogy&quot; got underway for her ninth patrol in the area south of Tokyo Bay. On 19 April 1945, she was on lifeguard duty in the Pacific Ocean southeast of Honshu, Japan, at when a United States Army Air Forces B-24 Liberator mistakenly strafed her and dropped a bomb which detonated as she passed through a depth of while submerging. The strafing inflicted minor but extensive damage on &quot;Pogy&quot;, but she suffered no casualties and was able to remain on patrol. On 29 April &quot;Pogy&quot; rescued ten Army aviators from the downed B-29 Superfortress &quot;The Queen Bee&quot;, and got underway for Saipan to transfer them. On 6 May she departed Saipan for Pearl Harbor arriving 15 May for refit.

====Tenth war patrol, July – August 1945====
On 2 July &quot;Pogy&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for the Sea of Japan on her tenth and final war patrol. She made a run under the minefields and patrolled in the &quot;Emperor&#x27;s private ocean&quot; until V-J Day. Hunting was better on this patrol. On 27 July &quot;Pogy&quot; sank a large cargo ship with two torpedoes, damaged a 10,000-ton tanker on 2 August, and on 5 August destroyed the 2,200-ton cargo ship &quot;Kotohirasan Maru&quot;. She returned to Midway 21 August with her World War II career completed.

===Postwar===
&quot;Pogy&quot; departed Midway 5 September for Panama and then the East Coast of the United States. She arrived New York 3 October.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Pogy&quot; was placed out of commission in the US Atlantic Reserve Fleet 20 July 1946 at Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut. She was struck from the Navy List 1 September 1958 and sold 1 May 1959.

<text>Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov (; – ) was a Russian public figure in the field of public education. He was the father of revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, who became a Bolshevik leader and founder of the Soviet Union, and Aleksandr Ulyanov, who was executed for his attempt to assassinate Tsar Alexander III in 1886.

==Life==
Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov was born in Astrakhan. His father was Nikolai Vasilyevich Ulyanov (or Ulyanin; 1765–1838), a port-city tailor and a former serf of possible Chuvash, Mordvinian, Russian or Kalmyk descent, who came from Sergachsky District, Nizhny Novgorod Governorate. He received his freedom from a landowner, Stepan Mikhailovich Brekhov. Ilya&#x27;s mother, Anna Alexeyevna Smirnova (1793–1871), was half-Kalmyk, half-Russian and the daughter of city-dweller Alexei Lukyanovich Smirnov, a son of Lukyan Smirnov. Nikolai married 30-year-old Anna in 1823. Ilya had three sisters and a brother.

Ulyanov graduated from Kazan University&#x27;s Department of Physics and Mathematics in 1854. In the 1850s and 1860s, he taught mathematics and physics at Penza Institute for the &quot;Dvoryane&quot;, and later at a gymnasium and a school for women in Nizhny Novgorod. Around that time, he married Maria Alexandrovna Blank. While at Penza, Ulyanov conducted meteorological observations, the basis on which he would write several scientific works.

In 1869, Ulyanov was appointed inspector of public schools in the Simbirsk &quot;guberniya&quot; (in 1874–1886 he was their director). In 1882, Ulyanov was promoted to the rank of Active State Councillor, which gave him a privilege of hereditary nobility and accompanied by the award of the Order of Saint Vladimir, 3rd Class.
Ulyanov was a well-educated man with excellent organizational and teaching skills. Some Soviet historians believed that his pedagogical views had been formed under the influence of the revolutionary ideas of Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Nikolai Dobrolyubov. Ulyanov contributed immensely to the elaboration of the theory and practice of elementary education. He was an advocate of equal rights for education regardless of gender, nationality and social status. Others, such as Tony Cliff, dispute this image (arguing that this was a posthumous Stalinist attempt to improve the reputation of Lenin&#x27;s family), saying in his biography of Lenin, &#x27;Nikolaevich&#x27;s standing in the Ministry of Education, and his steady rise up the hierarchical ladder, somehow do not fit the image of a revolutionary, or even a radical.&#x27; In 1871, Ulyanov opened the first Chuvash school in Simbirsk, which would later be transformed into Chuvash teacher&#x27;s seminar. He also established national schools for Mordvins and Tatars. Furthermore, Ulyanov organized and presided over many teachers&#x27; congresses and other similar events. 

In 1886, Ulyanov died of a brain hemorrhage while in Simbirsk, which was later renamed Ulyanovsk in honor of his son.

==Family==
*Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova (1835 - 1916), married in 1863, and had eight children:

<text>The Tajikistan national football team represents Tajikistan in international football and is controlled by the Tajikistan Football Federation, the governing body for football in Tajikistan. Tajikistan&#x27;s home ground is the Pamir Stadium in Dushanbe.

==History ==
Tajikistan played its first official game on 11 April 1994 in Tashkent as part of a regional tournament. It lost that game against Kazakhstan 0–1. The first official competition the team entered was the qualifiers for the 1996 AFC Asian Cup, when it was seeded in the 3-team Group 8 with Uzbekistan and Bahrain. Bahrain later withdrew, leaving Tajikistan to a play-off against their Middle Asian neighbors. Tajikistan won the first game 4–0, and were beaten in the away game 0–5 after extra time. It did not enter a World Cup qualifying tournament until the 1998 FIFA World Cup edition, recording 4 victories in its preliminary group stage including a 5–0 triumph over Turkmenistan, and losing only to China, which placed it second behind its eastern neighbors, and out of the tournament.

Following Tajikistan&#x27;s 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign, coach Mubin Ergashev and his staff were relieved of their duties.

Tajikistan were drawn into a 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification group with the Philippines, Yemen and Nepal. Following defeat to the Philippines on 27 March 2018, confirming Tajikistan&#x27;s failure to qualify for the Asian Cup, manager Khakim Fuzailov resigned.

After failing to have a direct spot for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Tajikistan hired Croatian manager Petar Šegrt, and Tajikistan took part in the third round of the 2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification, joining with Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Singapore. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, the third round was played in a single round-robin group format with a centralised host, which Tajikistan&#x27;s group saw its neighbour Kyrgyzstan hosting it. Tajikistan defeated Myanmar (4–0) and Singapore (1–0), before holding neighbour Kyrgyzstan to a goalless draw, topping the group and, after failing in 5 previous attempts, Tajikistan was able to qualify to its first-ever AFC Asian Cup and a major tournament in 2023. Tajikistan was invited to the 2022 King&#x27;s Cup in Thailand held in September 2022 where Tajikistan defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2–1 and sees them advanced to the final defeating Malaysia in the penalty shootout winning their second international trophy.

In the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Tajikistan reached the quarter-finals for the first time in their history after losing 1-0 to the eventual runner-up Jordan due to a 66th minute own goal from Vahdat Hanonov.

==Kit==
In September 2017, Tajikistan&#x27;s kit was supplied by Chinese sporting apparel company Li-Ning.

<text>Fried ice cream is a dessert made of a scoop of ice cream that is frozen hard, then breaded or coated in a batter before being quickly deep-fried, creating a warm, crispy shell around the still-cold ice cream. It is common in Chinese and Mexican cuisine.

== Origin ==
There are conflicting stories about the dessert&#x27;s origin. Some claim that it was first served during the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, where the ice cream sundae was also invented. Though in 1894, a Philadelphia company was given credit for its invention describing: &quot;A small, solid [cake] of the ice cream is enveloped in a thin sheet of pie crust and then dipped into boiling lard or butter to cook the outside to a crisp. Served immediately, the ice cream is found to be as solidly frozen as it was first prepared.&quot; 

It may be derived in part from Baked Alaska, originating earlier in the 19th century, which puts ice cream under a quickly broiled meringue.

== Preparation ==
The dessert is commonly made by taking a scoop of ice cream frozen well below the temperature at which ice cream is generally kept, possibly coating it in raw egg, rolling it in cornflakes or cookie crumbs, and briefly deep frying it. The extremely low temperature of the ice cream prevents it from melting while being fried. 

It may be sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and a touch of peppermint; whipped cream or honey may be used, as well.

== Associations with national cuisines ==
In the United States, fried ice cream has been associated with Asian cuisine, appearing in reviews of Chinese, Japanese, and Polynesian restaurants in the &quot;Dining Out&quot; section of the &quot;New York Times&quot; in the 1970s.

It also came to be associated with Mexican cuisine, in large part due to national chain Chi-Chi&#x27;s adopting a fried ice cream made with tortillas and cinnamon as its &quot;signature dessert&quot; when it opened in 1975.

In Australia, fried ice cream is strongly associated with Asian cuisine and particularly Australian Chinese cuisine. It is frequently served with caramel sauce.
