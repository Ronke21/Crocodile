<text>This is a glossary of terms used in [[Canadian football]]. The Glossary of American football article also covers many terms that are also used in the Canadian version of the game.

; Canadian Football League : The largest professional Canadian football league, with 9 teams split into two divisions each (West and East).
; Canadian Junior Football League : The largest non-professional minor junior football league in Canada.
; conversion : An untimed down awarded to a team that has just scored a touchdown. At levels below the CFL, including U Sports, the scoring team receives possession on the opponent&#x27;s 5-yard line. In the CFL, the scoring team receives possession on the opponent&#x27;s 25-yard line if it attempts a place kick, but at the 3-yard line if it chooses to run a standard scrimmage play. A place kick or drop kick through the uprights is worth 1 point; a play from scrimmage that would result in an offensive touchdown at other times in the game is worth 2 points. (This play is formally called a &quot;try&quot; in American football, but the terms &quot;conversion&quot;, &quot;PAT&quot; [point after touchdown], and &quot;point after&quot; are more commonly used; the scrimmage play is called a &quot;two-point conversion&quot;.)
; convert : see: conversion.
; cornerback : A defensive position on scrimmages. Typical formations include two cornerbacks, whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. See also defensive back.
; defensive back : One of the players whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. Typical defensive formations include five defensive backs: two cornerbacks, two defensive halfbacks, and one safety.
; defensive end : See defensive lineman.
; defensive halfback : A defensive position on scrimmages. Typical formations include two defensive halfbacks, one on each side, but deeper than the cornerbacks. Their main duty is to cover wide receivers. See also defensive back.
; defensive lineman : One of the players who line up opposite the offensive line on scrimmages. In a &quot;four-three&quot; formation, there are four defensive linemen: two defensive tackles and two defensive ends. In a &quot;three-four&quot; formation, there are three defensive linemen: one nose tackle and two defensive ends.
; defensive tackle : See defensive lineman.
; dribbled ball : A dribbled ball is one that has been kicked while not in possession of a player, for example, a loose ball following a fumble, a blocked kick, a kickoff, or a kick from scrimmage. The kicker of the dribbled ball and any player onside when the ball was kicked may legally recover the ball.
; illegal procedure : A five-yard penalty against the kicking team or the offence. Most often it is a lineman who moves after taking a three- or four-point stance but before the snap. Other illegal procedures include kicking the ball out of bounds on a kick-off and &quot;no end&quot;.
; linebacker : A defensive player positioned behind the defensive line on scrimmages. In a &quot;four-three&quot; formation, there are three linebackers; in a &quot;three-four&quot;, there are four. Linebackers can be used to blitz the quarterback, make tackles on running plays, or be used for pass coverage.
; major or major score : An alternate term for touchdown.
; no end : A penalty on the offence for having fewer than seven players within one yard of the line of scrimmage at the snap. It is most often called on field goal attempts because of the curved formation of linemen used: if the line is curved back too far, the ends are too far back to be considered linemen, and are called for &quot;illegal procedure: no end&quot;. (This violation is known as an &quot;illegal formation&quot; in the American game.)
; nose tackle : See defensive lineman.
; no yards : A penalty against the kicking team: all offside (sense 2) players must be at least five yards from the ball when it is first touched by a member of the receiving team. This is now always a 15-yard penalty.
; offside : Not onside. A player not onside incurs a five-yard penalty.
; onside
# Legally positioned at the kick-off or the snap. On kick-offs, members of the kicking team must be behind the kick-off line; members of the receiving team must be at least 10 yards from the kick-off line. On scrimmages, at the snap the offence must be behind the line of scrimmage; the defence must be at least one yard beyond the line of scrimmage.
# A player of the kicking team who can legally recover the kick. The kicker and any teammates behind the ball at the time of the kick are onside. Thus on kick-offs all players of the kicking team are onside, but on other kicks usually only the kicker is. The holder on a place kick is not considered onside.
; onside kick : A kick recovered by an onside player (sense 2).
; pivot : An alternate term for the quarterback.
; quick kick : A type of trick play: a punt from a running or passing formation, usually on second down. The play relies on catching the defence by surprise and using an onside player (sense 2) to recover the ball and gain a first down or even a touchdown. A rule change in the early 1970s that allowed the receiving team to block before gaining possession made the quick kick even more difficult to execute successfully, so it is rarely attempted today.
; rouge : see: single.
; safety
#A defensive position on scrimmages, also called free safety. Typical formations include a single safety, whose main duty is to cover wide receivers. See also defensive back.
#A two-point score. The defence scores a safety when the offence carries or passes the ball into its own goal area and then fails to run, pass, or kick the ball back into the field of play; when this term is used in this sense, it is also referred to as a &quot;safety touch&quot;.
; short kick-off : Deliberately kicking the ball just over 10 yards on a kick-off in an attempt to make an onside kick. Short kick-offs are usually directed towards the sideline (left sideline for a right-footed kicker) to give members of the kicking team time to get downfield to recover it. It is illegal procedure if the ball is recovered before it has gone 10 yards downfield.
; single : A one-point score. The kicking team scores a single when the ball is punted, drop kicked, or place kicked into the receiving team&#x27;s end zone (without scoring a field goal or hitting the goal post) and the receiving team fails to run or kick the ball back into the field of play. The single also is scored if the kick goes out of bounds in the end zone, except on a kickoff. On a kickoff, the single is scored only if the ball stays inbounds and is not run out of the zone, or if the defence puts the ball out of bounds in the end zone.
; spearing : An unnecessary roughness penalty of 15 yards imposed when the player drives his helmet into an opponent in an unnecessary and excessive manner. The referee&#x27;s signal is a chopping motion above the head.
; third down : The final of a set of three downs. Unless a first down is achieved or a penalty forces a replay of the down, the team will lose control of the ball after this play. If a team does not think they can get a first down, they often punt on third down or attempt a field goal if they are close enough to do so.
; three-minute warning : In the Canadian Football League, the three-minute warning is given when three minutes of game time remain on the game clock in the first and second halves of a game.
; third down conversion
The act of using a third down play to make a first down (also known as &quot;going for it [on third down]&quot;). These are comparatively uncommon. If a team is close enough to the goal posts, they will generally attempt a field goal on third down. Otherwise, they will usually punt. However, the coach may elect to try to get a new first down. This is more likely if the amount of yardage needed for the conversion is small (typically a yard or less), if the team is trailing by a significant amount (likelihood of such a try increasing as it gets later in the game), if a team is in a position on the field where a punt would likely result in a single point for them but a field goal attempt is unlikely to succeed (usually between the opponent&#x27;s 40- and 50-yard lines) or during overtime where the team must score on that possession.
; time count : A foul committed when the offence fails to put the ball in play within 20 seconds of the ball being declared ready for play. (This foul is called &quot;delay of game&quot; in American football.) Penalty: Before the three-minute warning and during convert attempts at any time in the game, 5 yards with the down repeated. After the three-minute warning, loss of down on first or second down and 10 yards on third down; the referee has the right to give possession to the defence for repeated time count violations on third down.
; U Sports : The principal governing body of university sports in Canada, including college football. The organization has been formerly known as the Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union, Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union, and Canadian Interuniversity Sport.
; yard : A yard is exactly 0.9144 metre. Despite Canada having mostly migrated to the metric system in the 1970s, the field in Canadian football remains measured in yards (as is the field in American football).
; waggle : The act of running towards the line of scrimmage prior to the snap, as exercised by slotbacks. In Canadian football, only the 5 offensive linemen and the two ends (typically, wide receivers) aren&#x27;t allowed to move prior to the snap.

<doc id="1107313" wikidata="Q1605513" url="?curid=1107313" title="Wagner College">
<text>Wagner College is a private liberal arts college in Staten Island, New York City. It was founded in 1883 and has an enrollment of 1,947 students as of 2023. Wagner has an academic program known as The Wagner Plan for the Practical Liberal Arts. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.

== History ==
Wagner College was founded in 1883 in Rochester, New York, as the Lutheran Proseminary of Rochester. Its purpose was to prepare young men for admission to Lutheran seminaries and to ensure that they were sufficiently fluent in both English and German to minister to the large German immigrant community of that day. The school&#x27;s six-year curriculum (covering the high-school and junior-college years) was modeled on the German &quot;gymnasium&quot; curriculum. In 1886, the school was renamed Wagner Memorial Lutheran College, after a building in Rochester was purchased for its use by John G. Wagner in memory of his son.

In 1918, at the behest of then-college president Frederick Sutter, the college moved to the 38-acre (15 ha) former Cunard estate on Grymes Hill, Staten Island. An Italianate villa called Westwood, the Cunard mansion (), is extant (now Cunard Hall), as is the neighboring former hotel annex that was built in 1905 (initially named North Hall, now called Reynolds House). The college soon expanded to 57 acres (23 ha) after it acquired the neighboring Jacob Vanderbilt estate in 1922. In the 1920s, the curriculum began to move toward an American-style liberal arts curriculum that was solidified when the state of New York granted the college degree-granting status in 1928. The college admitted women in 1933 and introduced graduate programs in 1951. The college expanded further when it purchased the W.G. Ward estate in 1949 (current site of Wagner College Stadium), and again in 1993, when the college acquired the adjacent property of the former Augustinian Academy, which has largely remained wooded green space and athletic fields. The college now occupies 105 acres (42 ha) on the hill and has commanding views of the New York Harbor, the Verrazzano Bridge, Downtown Brooklyn, and Lower Manhattan.

== New York City Writers Conference ==
From 1956 through the late 1960s, Wagner College was the home of the New York City Writers Conference, which brought some of the leading lights of the literary world to campus each summer. Instructors included Saul Bellow, Robert Lowell, Edward Albee, Kay Boyle and Kenneth Koch. From 1961 to 1963, while English professor Willard Maas directed the conference, it served as a training ground for poets of the New York School.

Maas himself was a significant figure in the New York avant-garde world of the 1950s and 1960s; Edward Albee used Maas and his wife, experimental filmmaker Marie Menken, as the models for his lead characters in the early masterwork, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;

The Stanley Drama Award, which began as a prize given at the conclusion of the NYC Writers Conference, has provided encouragement for several notable playwrights, including: Terrence McNally for &quot;This Side of the Door&quot; (1962), an early version of &quot;And Things that Go Bump in the Night&quot;; Adrienne Kennedy for &quot;Funnyhouse of a Negro&quot; (1963); Lonne Elder III for an early version of &quot;Ceremonies in Dark Old Men&quot; (1965), and Jonathan Larson in 1993 for an early version of &quot;Rent&quot;.

== Campus ==

Prominent early buildings include Cunard Hall (ca. 1851); Reynolds House (1905); Kairos House (1918), a Craftsman Style cottage; and Main Hall (1930, restored 2012) and Parker Hall (1923), built in the Collegiate Gothic style. Main Hall provides classroom and office space and a theater auditorium. Parker Hall, first built as a dormitory, is used for faculty offices.

Two cottages built in the early 1920s provide administrative space for the college&#x27;s Public Safety and Lifelong Learning offices.

Three dormitory facilities were constructed during the college&#x27;s major building drive: Guild Hall (1951), Parker Towers (1964) and Harbor View Hall (1969), later complemented by Foundation Hall (2010), a residence hall for upperclassmen. About two-thirds of undergraduates live on campus.

Another dormitory building, Campus Hall (1957), now provides classroom and office space.

The Horrmann Library (1961) contains over 200,000 volumes and holds the collection and personal papers of poet Edwin Markham.

The Megerle Science Building and Spiro Hall were opened in 1968, followed by the Wagner Union in 1970.

Two building projects have expanded earlier structures. In 1999, a significant expansion of the 1951 Sutter Gymnasium created the modern Spiro Sports Center. And in 2002, a pair of Prairie Style cottages constructed around 1905 were refurbished and joined by a bridge building into Pape Admissions House.

Three substantial resources on the physical history of the Wagner College campus have been published:
#&quot;Founding Faces &amp; Places: An Illustrated History Of Wagner Memorial Lutheran College, 1869–1930,&quot; first published for Wagner College&#x27;s 125th anniversary commemoration in 2008,
#&quot;Wagner College Memories: A Photographic Remembrance of Grymes Hill&quot; (2011), and
#&quot;Wagner College History Tour,&quot; a three-part series published in the Winter 2015–2016, Fall 2016 and Summer 2017 issues of &quot;Wagner Magazine&quot;.

==Rankings==
Wagner College&#x27;s ranking in the 2023 edition of Best Colleges by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; is Regional Universities North, tied for #69.

== Athletics ==
Wagner College offers athletic scholarships and competes at the NCAA Division I level in all intercollegiate athletics. Football competes at the NCAA Division I FCS – formerly I-AA – level.

Wagner is a member of the Northeast Conference. Men&#x27;s varsity intercollegiate teams are fielded in 10 sports: baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, tennis, and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and men&#x27;s water polo, which was established in fall 2016. Women&#x27;s varsity intercollegiate teams are fielded in 14 sports: basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor), and water polo, in addition to three newly added sports in fencing (2016), triathlon (2018) and field hockey, which was reinstated in 2018.

Walt Hameline, in 38 years (1982–present) as the director of athletics and 34 years as head football coach at Wagner (1981–2014), won the school&#x27;s only National Championship with a 19–3 victory over the University of Dayton in the 1987 NCAA Division III Championship game (also known as the 1987 Stagg Bowl). He was named NCAA Division III Coach of the Year in 1987. During his 34-year coaching career, Hameline amassed an all-time record of 223–139–2 (.615) at Wagner College. Upon his retirement as head football coach following the 2014 regular season, those 223 victories ranked fifth among active head Football Championship Subdivision head coaches and remains in the top 10 among all Division I-FCS coaches in the United States.

Notable Wagner sports coaches of the past include former Seton Hall University, NBA head coach and current TV analyst P.J. Carlesimo (head basketball coach 1976–1982), former Marquette University and Wagner head coach Mike Deane, Jim Lee Howell (head football coach 1947–1953), and former University of Florida head football coach Dan Mullen (assistant football coach 1994–1995). In 2019, two NFL coaches who had previously been Wagner assistant coaches were elevated to defensive coordinator positions. As of 2025, Lou Anarumo heads the Indianapolis Colts&#x27; defense, while Patrick Graham is defensive coordinator for the Las Vegas Raiders. 

The football team&#x27;s home venue is Hameline Field (designated in 2012) at Wagner College Stadium, while the basketball teams play their home games in the Spiro Sports Center&#x27;s Sutter Gymnasium.

Six of Wagner&#x27;s student athletes have been NEC Student-Athlete of the Year winners (2013–2018).

<doc id="1107326" wikidata="Q335571" url="?curid=1107326" title="Baldachin">
<text>A baldachin, or baldaquin (from ), is a canopy of state typically placed over an altar or throne. It had its beginnings as a cloth canopy, but in other cases it is a sturdy, permanent architectural feature, particularly over high altars in cathedrals, where such a structure is more correctly called a ciborium when it is sufficiently architectural in form. Baldachins are often supported on columns, especially when they are disconnected from an enclosing wall.

A cloth of honour or cloth of estate is a simpler cloth hanging vertically behind the throne, usually continuing to form a canopy. It can also be used for similar canopies in interior design, for example above beds, and for processional canopies used in formal state ceremonies such as coronations, held up by four or more men with poles attached to the corners of the cloth.

&quot;&quot;Baldachin&quot; was originally a luxurious type of cloth from Baghdad, from which name the word is ultimately derived, appearing in English as &quot;baudekin&quot; and other spellings. Matthew Paris records that Henry III of England wore a robe &quot;de preciosissimo baldekino&quot;&quot; at a ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1247. The word for the cloth became the word for the ceremonial canopies made from the cloth.

==Canopies of state==
In the Middle Ages, a hieratic canopy of state (or &quot;estate&quot;), cloth of honour, or cloth of state was hung above the seat of a personage of sufficient standing, as a symbol of authority. The seat under such a canopy of state would normally be raised on a dais. The cloth above a seat generally continued vertically down to the ground behind the seat. Emperors and kings, reigning dukes and bishops were accorded this honour. In a 15th-century manuscript illumination the sovereign Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes sits in state to receive a presentation copy of the author&#x27;s book. His seat is raised on a carpet-covered dais and backed with a richly embroidered &quot;dosser&quot; (French, &quot;dos&quot;). Under his feet is a cushion, such as protected the feet of the King of France when he presided at a &quot;lit de justice&quot;. The King of France was also covered by a mobile canopy during his coronation, held up on poles by several peers of France. The Virgin Mary in particular is very often shown sitting under a cloth of honour in medieval and Renaissance paintings where she is shown enthroned with saints.

The cloth was often simply a luxurious textile, often imported and with rich patterns, as in brocades, but might have heraldic elements. French kings are often shown with blue cloths patterned with the gold fleur-de-lys. Margaret Beaufort, mother of Henry VII in her portrait by an anonymous artist, c. 1500 prays under a canopy of estate; one can see the dosser against the gilded leather wall-covering and the tester above her head (the Tudor rose at its centre) supported on cords from the ceiling. The coats-of-arms embroidered or woven into the tapestry are of England (parted as usual with France) and the portcullis badge of the Beauforts.

Sometimes, as in the presentation miniature &quot;Jean Wauquelin presenting his &#x27;Chroniques de Hainaut&#x27; to Philip the Good&quot; by Rogier van der Weyden, the cloth continues over the seat, and then to the floor. In the summer of 1520, a meeting was staged between Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England, where the ostentatious display of wealth and power earned the meeting-place the name of &quot;The Field of Cloth of Gold&quot;. The canopy of estate may still be seen in most formal throne rooms.

When Mary, Queen of Scots, was a prisoner in England at Tutbury Castle in 1585 she protested to her keepers Amias Paulet and John Somers about the removal of her cloth of estate from a dining room, which seemed to be a slight against her royal status.

== State bed ==
===Ceremonial===
The state bed, intended for receiving important visitors and producing heirs before a select public, but not intended for sleeping in, evolved during the second half of the seventeenth century, developing the medieval tradition of receiving visitors in the bedroom, which had become the last and most private room of the standard suite of rooms in a Baroque apartment. Louis XIV developed the rituals of receptions in his state bedchamber, the &quot;petit lever&quot; to which only a handful of his court élite might expect to be invited. The other monarchs of Europe soon imitated his practice; even his staunchest enemy, William III of England, had his &quot;grooms of the bedchamber&quot;, a signal honour.

The state bed, a &quot;lit à la duchesse&quot;—its canopy supported without visible posts—was delivered for the use of Queen Marie Leszczyńska at Versailles, as the centrepiece of a new decor realised for the Queen in 1730–35. Its tester is quickly recognisable as a baldachin, serving its time-honoured function; the bedding might easily be replaced by a gilded throne. The queens of France spent a great deal of time in their &quot;chambre&quot;, where they received the ladies of the court at the morning &quot;lever&quot; and granted private audiences. By the time Marie Antoinette escaped the mob from this bedroom, such state beds, with the elaborate etiquette they embodied, were already falling out of use. A state bed with a domed tester designed in 1775–76 by Robert Adam for Lady Child at Osterley Park and another domed state bed, delivered by Thomas Chippendale for Sir Edwin Lascelles at Harewood House, Yorkshire, in 1773 are two of the last English state beds intended for a main floor State Bedroom in a non-royal residence.

===For sleep===
In Britain, monarchs slept in a state bed in the Palace of Westminster the night before their coronation. This tradition was started by William the Conqueror in 1066 and continued until 1821, when George IV was the last monarch to sleep in the bed. The original state bed was damaged in a fire and replaced in 1859. The new bed remained in the Speaker&#x27;s House until the 1940s, when it was moved out as too opulent to be there during the difficult times of the Second World War. It was probably sold during a government modernisation, somehow appeared in an auction in Northamptonshire, and was bought for a family for £100 in the 1960s. They used it for thirty years, recognising that it was important but not knowing where it came from until an interiors expert at the Victoria and Albert Museum published an appeal to try to find it. The bed was bought back from the family and returned to Speaker&#x27;s House after restoration and with new hangings. It can be viewed during tours of the Speaker&#x27;s House.

== St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica ==

Pope Urban VIII commissioned Gian Lorenzo Bernini to design and construct a large structure that would be placed over the main altar, believed to be above the tomb of Saint Peter, in the new St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The canopy imitated cloth in bronze, as did many subsequent imitations. This famous and spectacular feature is generally called the &quot;Baldacchino&quot;, though strictly it is a ciborium.

Bernini&#x27;s design for the Baldacchino incorporated giant solomonic columns inspired by columns that ringed the altar of the Old St. Peter&#x27;s. These columns were originally donated by Constantine, and a false tradition asserts they are the columns from the Temple of Jerusalem. The lowest parts of the four columns of Bernini&#x27;s Baldachin have a helical groove, and the middle and upper sections of the columns are covered in olive and bay branches, which are populated with a myriad of bees and small putti. Pope Urban VIII&#x27;s family coat of arms, those of the Barberini family, with their signature bees, are at the base of every column.

All of these combine to create a feeling of upward movement.

== Processional canopy ==

A baldachin may also be used in formal processions, including royal entries, coronation or funeral processions, to signify the elite status of the individual it covers. The origins of such an emblematic use in Europe lay in the courts of the Neo-Assyrian state, adopted in Athens perhaps as early as the late seventh century BC, but relegated to the use of women by the late fifth century (compare parasol).

Such canopies might be made of anything from muslin to heavy brocade, or even constructed of less flexible materials, and are supported by poles, whether affixed to a carriage, or carried by people walking on each side. An Egyptian pharaoh, for example, was escorted both in life and in death by such a canopy of estate.

Francisco Franco, the ruler of Spain from 1939 to 1975, frequently walked under a baldachin after formally proclaiming Spain a monarchy—a privilege he appropriated as de facto regent for life.

In Spanish Holy Week processions the sculptures of Virgin Mary, shown as Queen of Sorrow, use to go on their floats under canopies with embroideries Madr with gold or silver yarn

== Surname Baldacchino ==
The surname Baldacchino comes from the artisans who used to make the Baldachin. The surname is found mainly in the islands of Malta and Sicily, particularly in Agrigento and Naro.

<text>The Notch signaling pathway is a highly conserved cell signaling system present in most animals. Mammals possess four different notch receptors, referred to as NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, and NOTCH4. The notch receptor is a single-pass transmembrane receptor protein. It is a hetero-oligomer composed of a large extracellular portion, which associates in a calcium-dependent, non-covalent interaction with a smaller piece of the notch protein composed of a short extracellular region, a single transmembrane-pass, and a small intracellular region.

Notch signaling promotes proliferative signaling during neurogenesis, and its activity is inhibited by Numb to promote neural differentiation. It plays a major role in the regulation of embryonic development. 

Notch signaling is dysregulated in many cancers, and faulty notch signaling is implicated in many diseases, including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with sub-cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), multiple sclerosis, Tetralogy of Fallot, and Alagille syndrome. Inhibition of notch signaling inhibits the proliferation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in both cultured cells and a mouse model.

== Discovery ==

In 1914, John S. Dexter noticed the appearance of a notch in the wings of the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;. The alleles of the gene were identified in 1917 by American evolutionary biologist Thomas Hunt Morgan. Its molecular analysis and sequencing was independently undertaken in the 1980s by Spyros Artavanis-Tsakonas and Michael W. Young. Alleles of the two &quot;C. elegans&quot; &quot;Notch&quot; genes were identified based on developmental phenotypes: &quot;lin-12&quot; and &quot;glp-1&quot;. The cloning and partial sequence of &quot;lin-12&quot; was reported at the same time as &quot;Drosophila&quot; &quot;Notch&quot; by Iva Greenwald.

== Mechanism ==
The Notch protein spans the cell membrane, with part of it inside and part outside. Ligand proteins binding to the extracellular domain induce proteolytic cleavage and release of the intracellular domain, which enters the cell nucleus to modify gene expression.

The cleavage model was first proposed in 1993 based on work done with &quot;Drosophila&quot; &quot;Notch&quot; and &quot;C. elegans&quot; &quot;lin-12&quot;, informed by the first oncogenic mutation affecting a human &quot;Notch&quot; gene. Compelling evidence for this model was provided in 1998 by in vivo analysis in &quot;Drosophila&quot; by Gary Struhl and in cell culture by Raphael Kopan. Although this model was initially disputed, the evidence in favor of the model was irrefutable by 2001.

The receptor is normally triggered via direct cell-to-cell contact, in which the transmembrane proteins of the cells in direct contact form the ligands that bind the notch receptor. The Notch binding allows groups of cells to organize themselves such that, if one cell expresses a given trait, this may be switched off in neighbouring cells by the intercellular notch signal. In this way, groups of cells influence one another to make large structures. Thus, lateral inhibition mechanisms are key to Notch signaling. &quot;lin-12&quot; and &quot;Notch&quot; mediate binary cell fate decisions, and lateral inhibition involves feedback mechanisms to amplify initial differences.

The Notch cascade consists of Notch and Notch ligands, as well as intracellular proteins transmitting the notch signal to the cell&#x27;s nucleus. The Notch/Lin-12/Glp-1 receptor family was found to be involved in the specification of cell fates during development in &quot;Drosophila&quot; and &quot;C. elegans&quot;.

The intracellular domain of Notch forms a complex with CBF1 and Mastermind to activate transcription of target genes. The structure of the complex has been determined.

=== Pathway ===

Maturation of the notch receptor involves cleavage at the prospective extracellular side during intracellular trafficking in the Golgi complex. This results in a bipartite protein, composed of a large extracellular domain linked to the smaller transmembrane and intracellular domain. Binding of ligand promotes two proteolytic processing events; as a result of proteolysis, the intracellular domain is liberated and can enter the nucleus to engage other DNA-binding proteins and regulate gene expression.

Notch and most of its ligands are transmembrane proteins, so the cells expressing the ligands typically must be adjacent to the notch expressing cell for signaling to occur. The notch ligands are also single-pass transmembrane proteins and are members of the DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2) family of proteins. In &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; (the fruit fly), there are two ligands named Delta and Serrate. In mammals, the corresponding names are Delta-like and Jagged. In mammals there are multiple Delta-like and Jagged ligands, as well as possibly a variety of other ligands, such as F3/contactin.

In the nematode &quot;C. elegans&quot;, two genes encode homologous proteins, &quot;glp-1&quot; and &quot;lin-12&quot;. There has been at least one report that suggests that some cells can send out processes that allow signaling to occur between cells that are as much as four or five cell diameters apart.

The notch extracellular domain is composed primarily of small cystine-rich motifs called EGF-like repeats.

Notch 1, for example, has 36 of these repeats. Each EGF-like repeat is composed of approximately 40 amino acids, and its structure is defined largely by six conserved cysteine residues that form three conserved disulfide bonds. Each EGF-like repeat can be modified by &quot;O&quot;-linked glycans at specific sites. An &quot;O&quot;-glucose sugar may be added between the first and second conserved cysteines, and an &quot;O&quot;-fucose may be added between the second and third conserved cysteines. These sugars are added by an as-yet-unidentified &quot;O&quot;-glucosyltransferase (except for Rumi), and GDP-fucose Protein &quot;O&quot;-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1), respectively. The addition of &quot;O&quot;-fucose by POFUT1 is absolutely necessary for notch function, and, without the enzyme to add &quot;O&quot;-fucose, all notch proteins fail to function properly. As yet, the manner by which the glycosylation of notch affects function is not completely understood.

The &quot;O&quot;-glucose on notch can be further elongated to a trisaccharide with the addition of two xylose sugars by xylosyltransferases, and the &quot;O&quot;-fucose can be elongated to a tetrasaccharide by the ordered addition of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar by an N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase called Fringe, the addition of a galactose by a galactosyltransferase, and the addition of a sialic acid by a sialyltransferase.

To add another level of complexity, in mammals there are three Fringe GlcNAc-transferases, named lunatic fringe, manic fringe, and radical fringe. These enzymes are responsible for something called a &quot;fringe effect&quot; on notch signaling. If Fringe adds a GlcNAc to the &quot;O&quot;-fucose sugar then the subsequent addition of a galactose and sialic acid will occur. In the presence of this tetrasaccharide, notch signals strongly when it interacts with the Delta ligand, but has markedly inhibited signaling when interacting with the Jagged ligand. The means by which this addition of sugar inhibits signaling through one ligand, and potentiates signaling through another is not clearly understood.

Once the notch extracellular domain interacts with a ligand, an ADAM-family metalloprotease called ADAM10, cleaves the notch protein just outside the membrane. This releases the extracellular portion of notch (NECD), which continues to interact with the ligand. The ligand plus the notch extracellular domain is then endocytosed by the ligand-expressing cell. There may be signaling effects in the ligand-expressing cell after endocytosis; this part of notch signaling is a topic of active research. After this first cleavage, an enzyme called γ-secretase (which is implicated in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) cleaves the remaining part of the notch protein just inside the inner leaflet of the cell membrane of the notch-expressing cell. This releases the intracellular domain of the notch protein (NICD), which then moves to the nucleus, where it can regulate gene expression by activating the transcription factor CSL. It was originally thought that these CSL proteins suppressed Notch target transcription. However, further research showed that, when the intracellular domain binds to the complex, it switches from a repressor to an activator of transcription. Other proteins also participate in the intracellular portion of the notch signaling cascade.

=== Ligand interactions ===

Notch signaling is initiated when Notch receptors on the cell surface engage ligands presented &quot;in trans&quot; on opposing cells&quot;.&quot; Despite the expansive size of the Notch extracellular domain, it has been demonstrated that EGF domains 11 and 12 are the critical determinants for interactions with Delta. Additional studies have implicated regions outside of Notch EGF11-12 in ligand binding. For example, Notch EGF domain 8 plays a role in selective recognition of Serrate/Jagged and EGF domains 6-15 are required for maximal signaling upon ligand stimulation. A crystal structure of the interacting regions of Notch1 and Delta-like 4 (Dll4) provided a molecular-level visualization of Notch-ligand interactions, and revealed that the N-terminal MNNL (or C2) and DSL domains of ligands bind to Notch EGF domains 12 and 11, respectively. The Notch1-Dll4 structure also illuminated a direct role for Notch O-linked fucose and glucose moieties in ligand recognition, and rationalized a structural mechanism for the glycan-mediated tuning of Notch signaling.

=== Synthetic Notch signaling ===

It is possible to engineer synthetic Notch receptors by replacing the extracellular receptor and intracellular transcriptional domains with other domains of choice. This allows researchers to select which ligands are detected, and which genes are upregulated in response. Using this technology, cells can report or change their behavior in response to contact with user-specified signals, facilitating new avenues of both basic and applied research into cell-cell signaling. Notably, this system allows multiple synthetic pathways to be engineered into a cell in parallel.

== Function ==

The Notch signaling pathway is important for cell-cell communication, which involves gene regulation mechanisms that control multiple cell differentiation processes during embryonic and adult life.
Notch signaling also has a role in the following processes:
:* neuronal function and development
:* stabilization of arterial endothelial fate and angiogenesis
:* regulation of crucial cell communication events between endocardium and myocardium during both the formation of the valve primordial and ventricular development and differentiation
:* cardiac valve homeostasis, as well as implications in other human disorders involving the cardiovascular system
:* timely cell lineage specification of both endocrine and exocrine pancreas
:* influencing of binary fate decisions of cells that must choose between the secretory and absorptive lineages in the gut
:* expansion of the hematopoietic stem cell compartment during bone development and participation in commitment to the osteoblastic lineage, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for notch in bone regeneration and osteoporosis
:* expansion of the hemogenic endothelial cells along with signaling axis involving Hedgehog signaling and Scl
:*T cell lineage commitment from common lymphoid precursor 
:* regulation of cell-fate decision in mammary glands at several distinct development stages
:* possibly some non-nuclear mechanisms, such as control of the actin cytoskeleton through the tyrosine kinase Abl
:* Regulation of the mitotic/meiotic decision in the &quot;C. elegans&quot; germline
:* development of alveoli in the lung.

It has also been found that Rex1 has inhibitory effects on the expression of notch in mesenchymal stem cells, preventing differentiation.

== Role in embryogenesis ==

The Notch signaling pathway plays an important role in cell-cell communication, and further regulates embryonic development.

=== Embryo polarity ===

Notch signaling is required in the regulation of polarity. For example, mutation experiments have shown that loss of Notch signaling causes abnormal anterior-posterior polarity in somites. Also, Notch signaling is required during left-right asymmetry determination in vertebrates.

Early studies in the nematode model organism &quot;C. elegans&quot; indicate that Notch signaling has a major role in the induction of mesoderm and cell fate determination. As mentioned previously, C. elegans has two genes that encode for partially functionally redundant Notch homologs, &quot;glp-1&quot; and &quot;lin-12&quot;. During C. elegans, GLP-1, the C. elegans Notch homolog, interacts with APX-1, the C. elegans Delta homolog. This signaling between particular blastomeres induces differentiation of cell fates and establishes the dorsal-ventral axis.

=== Role in somitogenesis ===
Notch signaling is central to somitogenesis. In 1995, Notch1 was shown to be important for coordinating the segmentation of somites in mice. Further studies identified the role of Notch signaling in the segmentation clock. These studies hypothesized that the primary function of Notch signaling does not act on an individual cell, but coordinates cell clocks and keep them synchronized. This hypothesis explained the role of Notch signaling in the development of segmentation and has been supported by experiments in mice and zebrafish. Experiments with Delta1 mutant mice that show abnormal somitogenesis with loss of anterior/posterior polarity suggest that Notch signaling is also necessary for the maintenance of somite borders.

During somitogenesis, a molecular oscillator in paraxial mesoderm cells dictates the precise rate of somite formation. A clock and wavefront model has been proposed in order to spatially determine the location and boundaries between somites. This process is highly regulated as somites must have the correct size and spacing in order to avoid malformations within the axial skeleton that may potentially lead to spondylocostal dysostosis. Several key components of the Notch signaling pathway help coordinate key steps in this process. In mice, mutations in Notch1, Dll1 or Dll3, Lfng, or Hes7 result in abnormal somite formation. Similarly, in humans, the following mutations have been seen to lead to development of spondylocostal dysostosis: DLL3, LFNG, or HES7.

=== Role in epidermal differentiation ===
Notch signaling is known to occur inside ciliated, differentiating cells found in the first epidermal layers during early skin development. Furthermore, it has found that presenilin-2 works in conjunction with ARF4 to regulate Notch signaling during this development. However, it remains to be determined whether gamma-secretase has a direct or indirect role in modulating Notch signaling.

== Role in central nervous system development and function ==

Early findings on Notch signaling in central nervous system (CNS) development were performed mainly in &quot;Drosophila&quot; with mutagenesis experiments. For example, the finding that an embryonic lethal phenotype in &quot;Drosophila&quot; was associated with Notch dysfunction indicated that Notch mutations can lead to the failure of neural and Epidermal cell segregation in early &quot;Drosophila&quot; embryos. In the past decade, advances in mutation and knockout techniques allowed research on the Notch signaling pathway in mammalian models, especially rodents.

The Notch signaling pathway was found to be critical mainly for neural progenitor cell (NPC) maintenance and self-renewal. In recent years, other functions of the Notch pathway have also been found, including glial cell specification, neurites development, as well as learning and memory.

=== Neuron cell differentiation ===

The Notch pathway is essential for maintaining NPCs in the developing brain. Activation of the pathway is sufficient to maintain NPCs in a proliferating state, whereas loss-of-function mutations in the critical components of the pathway cause precocious neuronal differentiation and NPC depletion. Modulators of the Notch signal, e.g., the Numb protein are able to antagonize Notch effects, resulting in the halting of cell cycle and the differentiation of NPCs. Conversely, the fibroblast growth factor pathway promotes Notch signaling to keep stem cells of the cerebral cortex in the proliferative state, amounting to a mechanism regulating cortical surface area growth and, potentially, gyrification. In this way, Notch signaling controls NPC self-renewal as well as cell fate specification.

A non-canonical branch of the Notch signaling pathway that involves the phosphorylation of STAT3 on the serine residue at amino acid position 727 and subsequent Hes3 expression increase (STAT3-Ser/Hes3 Signaling Axis) has been shown to regulate the number of NPCs in culture and in the adult rodent brain.

In adult rodents and in cell culture, Notch3 promotes neuronal differentiation, having a role opposite to Notch1/2. This indicates that individual Notch receptors can have divergent functions, depending on cellular context.

=== Neurite development ===

&quot;In vitro&quot; studies show that Notch can influence neurite development. &quot;In vivo&quot;, deletion of the Notch signaling modulator, Numb, disrupts neuronal maturation in the developing cerebellum, whereas deletion of Numb disrupts axonal arborization in sensory ganglia. Although the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not clear, together these findings suggest Notch signaling might be crucial in neuronal maturation.

=== Gliogenesis ===

In gliogenesis, Notch appears to have an instructive role that can directly promote the differentiation of many glial cell subtypes. For example, activation of Notch signaling in the retina favors the generation of Muller glia cells at the expense of neurons, whereas reduced Notch signaling induces production of ganglion cells, causing a reduction in the number of Muller glia.

=== Adult brain function ===

Apart from its role in development, evidence shows that Notch signaling is also involved in neuronal apoptosis, neurite retraction, and neurodegeneration of ischemic stroke in the brain In addition to developmental functions, Notch proteins and ligands are expressed in cells of the adult nervous system, suggesting a role in CNS plasticity throughout life. Adult mice heterozygous for mutations in either Notch1 or Cbf1 have deficits in spatial learning and memory. Similar results are seen in experiments with presenilins1 and 2, which mediate the Notch intramembranous cleavage. To be specific, conditional deletion of presenilins at 3 weeks after birth in excitatory neurons causes learning and memory deficits, neuronal dysfunction, and gradual neurodegeneration. Several gamma secretase inhibitors that underwent human clinical trials in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and MCI patients resulted in statistically significant worsening of cognition relative to controls, which is thought to be due to its incidental effect on Notch signalling.

== Role in cardiovascular development ==
The Notch signaling pathway is a critical component of cardiovascular formation and morphogenesis in both development and disease. It is required for the selection of endothelial tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis.

=== Cardiac development ===

Notch signal pathway plays a crucial role in at least three cardiac development processes: Atrioventricular canal development, myocardial development, and cardiac outflow tract (OFT) development.

==== Atrioventricular (AV) canal development ====
;AV boundary formation: Notch signaling can regulate the atrioventricular boundary formation between the AV canal and the chamber myocardium. Studies have revealed that both loss- and gain-of-function of the Notch pathway results in defects in AV canal development. In addition, the Notch target genes HEY1 and HEY2 are involved in restricting the expression of two critical developmental regulator proteins, BMP2 and Tbx2, to the AV canal.

;AV epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT): Notch signaling is also important for the process of AV EMT, which is required for AV canal maturation. After the AV canal boundary formation, a subset of endocardial cells lining the AV canal are activated by signals emanating from the myocardium and by interendocardial signaling pathways to undergo EMT. Notch1 deficiency results in defective induction of EMT. Very few migrating cells are seen and these lack mesenchymal morphology. Notch may regulate this process by activating matrix metalloproteinase2 (MMP2) expression, or by inhibiting vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin expression in the AV canal endocardium while suppressing the VEGF pathway via VEGFR2. In RBPJk/CBF1-targeted mutants, the heart valve development is severely disrupted, presumably because of defective endocardial maturation and signaling.

==== Ventricular development ====

Some studies in Xenopus and in mouse embryonic stem cells indicate that cardiomyogenic commitment and differentiation require Notch signaling inhibition. Active Notch signaling is required in the ventricular endocardium for proper trabeculae development subsequent to myocardial specification by regulating BMP10, NRG1, and EphrinB2 expression. Notch signaling sustains immature cardiomyocyte proliferation in mammals and zebrafish. A regulatory correspondence likely exists between Notch signaling and Wnt signaling, whereby upregulated Wnt expression downregulates Notch signaling, and a subsequent inhibition of ventricular cardiomyocyte proliferation results. This proliferative arrest can be rescued using Wnt inhibitors.

The downstream effector of Notch signaling, HEY2, was also demonstrated to be important in regulating ventricular development by its expression in the interventricular septum and the endocardial cells of the cardiac cushions. Cardiomyocyte and smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of HEY2 results in impaired cardiac contractility, malformed right ventricle, and ventricular septal defects.

==== Ventricular outflow tract development ====

During development of the aortic arch and the aortic arch arteries, the Notch receptors, ligands, and target genes display a unique expression pattern. When the Notch pathway was blocked, the induction of vascular smooth muscle cell marker expression failed to occur, suggesting that Notch is involved in the differentiation of cardiac neural crest cells into vascular cells during outflow tract development.

=== Angiogenesis ===

Endothelial cells use the Notch signaling pathway to coordinate cellular behaviors during the blood vessel sprouting that occurs sprouting angiogenesis.

Activation of Notch takes place primarily in &quot;connector&quot; cells and cells that line patent stable blood vessels through direct interaction with the Notch ligand, Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4), which is expressed in the endothelial tip cells. VEGF signaling, which is an important factor for migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, can be downregulated in cells with activated Notch signaling by lowering the levels of Vegf receptor transcript. Zebrafish embryos lacking Notch signaling exhibit ectopic and persistent expression of the zebrafish ortholog of VEGF3, flt4, within all endothelial cells, while Notch activation completely represses its expression.

Notch signaling may be used to control the sprouting pattern of blood vessels during angiogenesis. When cells within a patent vessel are exposed to VEGF signaling, only a restricted number of them initiate the angiogenic process. Vegf is able to induce DLL4 expression. In turn, DLL4 expressing cells down-regulate Vegf receptors in neighboring cells through activation of Notch, thereby preventing their migration into the developing sprout. Likewise, during the sprouting process itself, the migratory behavior of connector cells must be limited to retain a patent connection to the original blood vessel.

== Role in endocrine development ==

During development, definitive endoderm and ectoderm differentiates into several gastrointestinal epithelial lineages, including endocrine cells. Many studies have indicated that Notch signaling has a major role in endocrine development.

=== Pancreatic development ===

The formation of the pancreas from endoderm begins in early development. The expression of elements of the Notch signaling pathway have been found in the developing pancreas, suggesting that Notch signaling is important in pancreatic development. Evidence suggests Notch signaling regulates the progressive recruitment of endocrine cell types from a common precursor, acting through two possible mechanisms. One is the &quot;lateral inhibition&quot;, which specifies some cells for a primary fate but others for a secondary fate among cells that have the potential to adopt the same fate. Lateral inhibition is required for many types of cell fate determination. Here, it could explain the dispersed distribution of endocrine cells within pancreatic epithelium. A second mechanism is &quot;suppressive maintenance&quot;, which explains the role of Notch signaling in pancreas differentiation. Fibroblast growth factor10 is thought to be important in this activity, but the details are unclear.

=== Intestinal development ===

The role of Notch signaling in the regulation of gut development has been indicated in several reports. Mutations in elements of the Notch signaling pathway affect the earliest intestinal cell fate decisions during zebrafish development. Transcriptional analysis and gain of function experiments revealed that Notch signaling targets Hes1 in the intestine and regulates a binary cell fate decision between adsorptive and secretory cell fates.

=== Bone development ===

Early &quot;in vitro&quot; studies have found the Notch signaling pathway functions as down-regulator in osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis. Notch1 is expressed in the mesenchymal condensation area and subsequently in the hypertrophic chondrocytes during chondrogenesis. Overexpression of Notch signaling inhibits bone morphogenetic protein2-induced osteoblast differentiation. Overall, Notch signaling has a major role in the commitment of mesenchymal cells to the osteoblastic lineage and provides a possible therapeutic approach to bone regeneration.

== Role in cell cycle control ==
Notch signaling is critical for cell fate identity and differentiation and regulates these processes in part by controlling cell cycle progression. Specifically, Notch has been shown to promote cell cycle progression at the G1/S transition in various systems.

=== Photoreceptor development ===
In &quot;Drosophila&quot; eye development, photoreceptors undergo two waves of differentiation, where five out of eight photoreceptors differentiate in the first wave (R8, R2, R5, R3, and R4), and the other three differentiate in the second wave (R1, R6, and R7). Notch has been shown to promote the second mitotic wave in &quot;Drosophila&quot; eye development. Specifically, it mediates the G1/S transition by promoting dE2F activation (&quot;Drosophila&quot; E2F), a member of the E2F transcription factor family, which regulates the expression of genes important for cell proliferation, specifically those involved in the G1/S transition. Notch does this by inhibiting RBF1 (the &quot;Drosophila&quot; homolog of the tumor suppressor Rb), which represses dE2F. Additionally, Notch is required for cyclin A activation, which accumulates during the G1/S transition and may be involved in S phase onset.

=== Health and disease ===
The role of Notch signaling in cell cycle regulation also has implications in health and disease. For example, Notch has been found to promote the expression of cyclin D3 and Cdk4/6 in human T-cells, thereby promoting the phosphorylation of Rb and facilitating the G1/S transition, implicating its role in cancer as several gain-of-function mutations in NOTCH1 have been identified in human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias and lymphomas. Additionally, in ventricular cardiomyocytes, which stop dividing shortly after birth, NOTCH2 signaling activation promotes cell cycle reentry. It induces the expression and nuclear translocation of cyclin D, which along with Cdk4/6 promotes the phosphorylation of Rb and causes cell cycle progression through the G1/S transition. This suggests that Notch signaling might regulate ventricular growth as well as cardiomyocyte regeneration, though this is unclear. 

=== Migratory identity ===
In the zebrafish trunk neural crest (TNC), cells migrate collectively in single-file chains, with a cell “leader” at the front of the chain that instructs the directionality of the trailing “follower” cells. Notch has been found to specify cell migratory identity in the trunk neural crest – specifically, high Notch specifies leaders while low Notch specifies followers. Further, cell cycle progression required for migration is regulated by Notch such that leader cells with high Notch activity quickly undergo the G1/S transition while cells with low Notch activity remain in the G1 phase for longer and thus become followers.

== Role in cancer ==

=== Leukemia ===
Aberrant Notch signaling is a driver of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and is mutated in at least 65% of all T-ALL cases. Notch signaling can be activated by mutations in Notch itself, inactivating mutations in FBXW7 (a negative regulator of Notch1), or rarely by t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocation. In the context of T-ALL, Notch activity cooperates with additional oncogenic lesions such as c-MYC to activate anabolic pathways such as ribosome and protein biosynthesis thereby promoting leukemia cell growth.

=== Urothelial bladder cancer ===
Loss of Notch activity is a driving event in urothelial cancer. A study identified inactivating mutations in components of the Notch pathway in over 40% of examined human bladder carcinomas. In mouse models, genetic inactivation of Notch signaling results in Erk1/2 phosphorylation leading to tumorigenesis in the urinary tract. As not all NOTCH receptors are equally involved in the urothelial bladder cancer, 90% of samples in one study had some level of NOTCH3 expression, suggesting that NOTCH3 plays an important role in urothelial bladder cancer. A higher level of NOTCH3 expression was observed in high-grade tumors, and a higher level of positivity was associated with a higher mortality risk. NOTCH3 was identified as an independent predictor of poor outcome. Therefore, it is suggested that NOTCH3 could be used as a marker for urothelial bladder cancer-specific mortality risk. It was also shown that NOTCH3 expression could be a prognostic immunohistochemical marker for clinical follow-up of urothelial bladder cancer patients, contributing to a more individualized approach by selecting patients to undergo control cystoscopy after a shorter time interval.

=== Liver cancer ===
In hepatocellular carcinoma, for instance, it was suggesting that AXIN1 mutations would provoke Notch signaling pathway activation, fostering the cancer development, but a recent study demonstrated that such an effect cannot be detected. Thus the exact role of Notch signaling in the cancer process awaits further elucidation.

== Notch inhibitors ==

The involvement of Notch signaling in many cancers has led to investigation of notch inhibitors (especially gamma-secretase inhibitors) as cancer treatments which are in different phases of clinical trials. at least 7 notch inhibitors were in clinical trials. MK-0752 has given promising results in an early clinical trial for breast cancer. Preclinical studies showed beneficial effects of gamma-secretase inhibitors in endometriosis, a disease characterised by increased expression of notch pathway constituents. Several notch inhibitors, including the gamma-secretase inhibitor LY3056480, are being studied for their potential ability to regenerate hair cells in the cochlea, which could lead to treatments for hearing loss and tinnitus.

== Mathematical modeling ==
Mathematical modeling in Notch-Delta signaling has become a pivotal tool in understanding pattern formation driven by cell-cell interactions, particularly in the context of lateral-inhibition mechanisms. The Collier model, a cornerstone in this field, employs a system of coupled ordinary differential equations to describe the feedback loop between adjacent cells. The model is defined by the equations:formula_1

where formula_2 and formula_3 represent the levels of Notch and Delta activity in cell formula_4, respectively. Functions formula_5 and formula_6 are typically Hill functions, reflecting the regulatory dynamics of the signaling process. The term formula_7 denotes the average level of Delta activity in the cells adjacent to cell formula_4, integrating juxtacrine signaling effects.

Recent extensions of this model incorporate long-range signaling, acknowledging the role of cell protrusions like filopodia (cytonemes) that reach non-neighboring cells. One extended model, often referred to as the formula_9-Collier model, introduces a weighting parameter formula_10 to balance juxtacrine and long-range signaling. The interaction term formula_7 is modified to include these protrusions, creating a more complex, non-local signaling network. This model is instrumental in exploring pattern formation robustness and biological pattern refinement, considering the stochastic nature of filopodia dynamics and intrinsic noise. The application of mathematical modeling in Notch-Delta signaling has been particularly illuminating in understanding the patterning of sensory organ precursors (SOPs) in the Drosophila&#x27;s notum and wing margin.

The mathematical modeling of Notch-Delta signaling thus provides significant insights into lateral inhibition mechanisms and pattern formation in biological systems. It enhances the understanding of cell-cell interaction variations leading to diverse tissue structures, contributing to developmental biology and offering potential therapeutic pathways in diseases related to Notch-Delta dysregulation.

<doc id="1107342" wikidata="Q843045" url="?curid=1107342" title="Kisha club">
<text>A is a Japanese news-gathering association of reporters from specific news organizations, whose reporting centers on a press room set up by sources such as the Prime Minister&#x27;s Official Residence, government ministries, local authorities, the police, or corporate bodies. In English, it also called a &quot;Press Club.&quot;

Institutions with a kisha club limit their press conferences to the journalists of that club, and membership rules for kisha clubs are restrictive. This blocks access by domestic non-member media, such as magazines and smaller newspapers, and the foreign media, as well as freelance reporters, to the press conferences.

While similar arrangements exist in other countries, the Japanese form of this type of organization is seen as one of the most extreme, with journalists actively denying access to other journalists, which has led to use of the Japanese term in other languages, often with a critical meaning.

== History ==
;1890
:In response to the ban imposed by the first Imperial Diet on reporting by newspaper reporters, a reporter from the newspaper called together the Diet correspondents from the Tokyo newspapers to form a , which in October merged with newspaper companies across Japan, changing its name to the , to become the first kisha club.
;March 1941
:With the formation of the , a newspaper control organization, the number of kisha clubs was reduced to one third, and kisha clubs were forbidden from governing themselves.
;October 26, 1949
:The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association created a &quot;Policy on Kisha Clubs&quot;, stating that they were &quot;an organization for the purpose of socialization, and are not to intervene in matters related to reporting&quot;.
;December 1997
:The Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association changed this policy, stating that kisha clubs were &quot;bases for reporting&quot; which allowed easy access to information held by public bodies.
;March 24, 2005
:Livedoor became the first Internet media company to apply for membership of the Japan Meteorological Agency kisha club.
:However, on March 15, 2006, the former president of Livedoor, Takafumi Horie, was charged with a breach of the , and for this reason the application was rejected unanimously by the companies present.
;July 9, 2005
:The freelance journalist and the deputy editor of the weekly magazine submitted an application for a provisional ruling against the Tokyo Metropolitan Police and the 15 companies in the related kisha club to the Tokyo District Court and Tokyo High Court, stating that groups such as kisha clubs must not be allowed to obstruct journalists wishing to attend at the offices of the Metropolitan Police and give questions, but the application was refused. A special appeal is being made to the Tokyo High Court.
;November 8, 2005
:When a journalist from NHK Ōtsu bureau was arrested in relation to an arson incident, the offices of the Shiga Prefecture Police kisha club to which he belonged were searched by the Shiga Prefecture Police.

===Reporting agreements===
Kisha clubs often make agreements on reporting, which are known as because they are communicated via a blackboard in a press room.
The aim of making reporting agreements is often to avoid excessive competition during reporting. Agreements may also be made based on a request by, for example, the police, to protect the victims in cases such as kidnappings.
These backroom agreements came under criticism following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, when they were blamed for causing journalists to self-censor, and limit their coverage to official announcements by government and plant officials.

==Magazine kisha clubs==
In 1956, the association was set up, containing &quot; and , formed from member companies, to expedite the reporting activities related to magazine editing&quot;.

==Advantages of kisha clubs==
Setting up a kisha club allows bodies such as government agencies to communicate official announcements rapidly to the media. In particular, it simplifies reporting in the case where the body giving the report gives the time of the announcement to the club. At the same time, it is possible to set up transmission equipment for each media company in the press room, reducing the time taken between gathering information and editing. If, for example, local authorities want to provide information, it is easy to convey it by communicating with the kisha club for a higher-level body.

Defenders of the system also argue that the kisha clubs&#x27; influence is used to open up the institution they are covering to scrutiny, although this argument would seem self-contradictory.

==Disadvantages of kisha clubs==
The kisha clubs have been widely criticized, both in Japan and abroad, for encouraging an extreme type of access-driven journalism that undermines the quality of journalism in Japan by stifling criticism and turning reporters into mouthpieces for the institutions that they are supposed to cover. In one representative criticism, Jonathan Watts, the former Tokyo bureau chief for The Guardian, said the kisha club create a problem of &quot;watchdogs becoming lapdogs&quot; because &quot;the kisha-club system rewards self-censorship, fosters uniformity and stifles competition.&quot;

In its 2023 rankings of World Press Freedom, the non-governmental group Reporters Without Borders singled out the kisha clubs as a major reason that it ranked Japan 68th out of 180 countries, saying, &quot;journalists find it hard put to fully play their role as democracy’s watchdog.&quot;

Smaller media companies, freelance journalists and foreign news organizations are often blocked from joining kisha clubs, leading to one of the most common criticisms, that the clubs foster opaque, exclusive ties between government officials and member journalists, who become overly reliant on their sources for information.

There have been cases when members of kisha clubs have been subject to penalties, such as being forbidden from attending the kisha club, for reporting information that was supposed to be kept secret, or that challenged the official narrative of the government agency where the club was based. In 2009, reporters for the &quot;Tokyo Shimbun,&quot; a regional newspaper, were banned from talking with Tokyo prosecutors for three weeks for naming a governing Liberal Democratic Party politician in their coverage of a political corruption scandal, when prosecutors were focusing their investigation solely on an opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa.

There is criticism that press rooms set up for kisha clubs by government agencies, local public bodies and the police are paid for with taxes, but can only be used by the member companies, leading to corruption. If local government agencies are included, the total yearly costs are thought to run to 600 million yen.

In 1921, a gas company bribed the to gain approval for a rise in gas prices. It was discovered that newspaper reporters attending the city hall and Tokyo Metropolitan Police kisha clubs had also been bribed, an event condemned by public opinion. (The Tokyo Gas suspected bribery incident.)

In 1974, when the weekly magazine Bungei Shunshū reported on the Kakuei Tanaka funding problem, the allegations were already well known in the kisha club but the media was silent about the story.

In 1998, during the broadcast of TBS&#x27; TV program , &quot;A Conversation with the Prime Minister&quot;, News 23 anchor Tetsuya Chikushi suggested to the prime minister of the time, Keizō Obuchi that, given the success of the Town Meetings held by President Bill Clinton, also shown by TBS, perhaps Obuchi would also like to take part in Clinton-style Town Meetings. Obuchi was keen, but the plan was scuppered due to opposition from the kisha club, and in the end &quot;Sori to Kataru&quot; continued to be shown in the same format as before. (Chikushi related these events in his book, &quot;Newscaster&quot;. Incidentally, Chikushi is known for having a critical stance towards kisha clubs.)

In 1999, there was an incident where some members of the media had a row with staff at the Ministry of Agriculture, Farming and Fisheries over the display of a Japanese flag at the meeting hall of the ministry kisha club. This was just after the National Flag and National Anthem Law was passed, in the midst of a debate about whether the government was forcing groups to display flags. In response to actions by some sections of the media, there was criticism from both those in favor of the National Flag and National Anthem Law and those against, including comments such as &quot;They shouldn&#x27;t be making a scene inside Ministry buildings in the first place&quot; and &quot;Isn&#x27;t this just a sign of the egotism of kisha clubs?&quot;

In 2000, the then Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi suddenly made telephone calls to Nippon TV and TV Asahi, and was allowed to appear live on these channels. The related kisha clubs criticized TV Asahi, saying that this was &quot;unprecedented&quot;. (Nippon TV was not criticized.)

On June 25, 2000, some notes titled &quot;A personal view on tomorrow&#x27;s press conference&quot; were found lying on the ground at the , a kisha club in the grounds of the Japanese Prime Minister&#x27;s official residence. This was the day before the meeting at which Prime Minister Yoshirō Mori was due to make an explanation about his &quot;Kami no kuni&quot; statements about religion in Japan, and the notes appeared to be a set of directions to the Prime Minister on how to handle questions from the media. Even though weekly news magazines published the name of the media organization (NHK) responsible for writing the document, the Cabinet Kisha Club did not take an active efforts to investigate the cause of the incident. The format in which the document was printed was the same as that of &quot;communication e-mails&quot; from the 5300 system terminals used for printing NHK stories, and the document also contained a term meaning &quot;private broadcasters&quot;, , which was only likely to have been used by NHK.

There has been criticism that the main work of reporters in a press room tends to be to summarize the contents of press conferences, so that they neglect to check whether what is announced is true and are more easily subject to media manipulation, and that this leads to fewer reporters learning to go out to different locations to do research. Akira Uozumi, a former Kyodo News journalist, stated that kisha clubs slowly wear down reporters psychologically, and blunt their instincts as journalists, saying (in the Asahi Shimbun, on May 26, 2001), that &quot;if 70% or 80% of your job is collecting secondary or tertiary information from government agencies as quickly as possible, it dulls your instinct for sensing what is actually going on in the world. Before you know it, the logic of the civil servants works its way into you, and it gets more difficult to think from the point of view of the people being governed. I thought it wasn&#x27;t happening to me, but five years after becoming freelance, I gradually began to realize it was.&quot;

As a result of this, most media reports are reports of announcements to kisha clubs, a phenomenon unthinkable in a developed country. In addition, there is criticism that the kisha club system decreases the distance between reporters and politicians, leading to improper relationships. As proof of this, Taro Kawano, a member of the House of Representatives, has said that it is normal for reporters (from the Japanese media) to have meals paid for by politicians (which would never happen in any other developed country), that when politicians go on visits reporters stay in the same hotel, and that the media consider that the sign of a &quot;good reporter&quot; is when &quot;the reporter and the politicians are the best of friends&quot;. (Quoted in by , published by . In addition, during the Matsumoto sarin incident, reports based on information given by the Metropolitan Police to a kisha club treated the first witness as a criminal.

There is also the criticism that kisha club are exclusive by nature, and rarely allow representatives of the new media, the foreign media or freelance journalists to join. In response to this, the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association introduced a policy whereby members from the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club of Japan would be treated in the same way as members from the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association, and in the late 1990s admitted Reuters as a member of the Kabuto Club. Since then, foreign-owned media organizations such as Bloomberg and Dow Jones with large-scale information-gathering networks have joined the majority of kisha clubs, and are involved in their administration. However, this has only been possible for a handful of foreign-owned media organizations, and as most foreign media organizations with representatives in Tokyo have only a few reporters there, it is impossible for them to have reporters join and remain present at kisha clubs. In fact, the EU has criticised kisha clubs for being exclusive, and the opinion has been stated that the kisha club system should be abolished, and all journalists with a reporter&#x27;s pass issued by the Japanese Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs allowed to collect material for stories at public institutions. This exclusivity is the reason why foreign journalists were not allowed to attend the police conference on the disappearance and murder of the British woman Lucie Blackman, and that when Prime Minister Koizumi visited the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, non-members of the kisha club were not allowed to accompany him. (Statement by Private Secretary Isao Iijima.) Reporters Without Borders, a journalists&#x27; organization which campaigns to protect the rights of journalists to freedom of speech, is calling for the Japanese government to abolish the kisha club system.

==Moves to abolish kisha clubs==
At a national level, in 1994, Ichirō Ozawa, the head of the Japan Renewal Party, undertook a groundbreaking experiment by allowing magazine reporters not in the kisha club to participate in press conferences, but this never took off, in part due to disagreements between Ozawa and the media.

In 2002, the then head of the Democratic Party of Japan, Katsuya Okada, introduced a format of press conference where all types of media, including sports newspapers, weekly magazines and foreign media organizations, could take part. Until then, only media in the could take part.

Some heads of local public bodies, business or financial groups have also closed press rooms, having realized the disadvantages of the kisha club system.

In June 1993, the , the kisha club for the Tokyo Stock Exchange, reformed its rules, which until then had restricted membership to Japanese media organizations, to include &quot;foreign media organizations which perform media work equivalent to that of the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association&quot;, a move which in practice opened the door to foreign media organizations.

In April 1996, the city of Kamakura, Kanagawa stopped using the , which had six companies as members, including national newspapers and the local Kanagawa Shimbun, and opened a &quot;Publicity media center&quot; which could be used by any media organization registered with the city. The then mayor, Ken Takeuchi, formerly of the editing committee of the Asahi Shimbun, and currently head of the internet newspaper &quot;janjan&quot;, stated that this was done as it was felt that &quot;it was not reasonable for a city institution funded by tax money to be monopolized by a kisha club which represented only one section of the media&quot;.

In March 1999, the was closed, at the request of Keidanren, the organization controlling it. This kisha club was focused on reporting related to industrial work such as electrical machinery, shipbuilding, semiconductors and automobiles. There was debate between the media and the companies making announcements about continuing with the kisha club, but as no breakthrough solution was found, the club was dissolved. It is thought that the root cause of this event was that electrical makers had been conducting open press conferences, and using press releases and e-mail, so there were no longer advantages to using a kisha club. The automobile industry, wanting to keep a kisha club active, opened an automobile industry kisha club as part of the , but the Asahi, Yomiuri, Mainichi and Nikkei newspapers refused to join, in effect depriving the club of its function.

In July 1999, NTT&#x27;s kisha club, was closed as a result of structural changes at NTT. This club had in the past been subject to criticism for the fact that it was a club dedicated to a single private company, but after the restructuring by NTT, a group of economic editors assembled from the different media companies agreed not to accept the Aoi Club as a kisha club. NTT accepted this and closed the club, with the aim of opening the press room to organizations other than club members, including magazines and the overseas media.

On August 6, 2001, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government requested that the Kajibashi/Yūraku kisha club pay charges for using the Tokyo government offices, but later retracted this, instead requiring only lighting, heating, water and telephone charges to be paid. The Governor of Tokyo, Shintarō Ishihara, also questioned the policy of not allowing magazines or foreign media organizations to participate in press conferences.

On March 30, 2004, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a written request to the central government offices, the offices of each prefecture, the police and other bodies, asking them to allow foreign reporters to participate in press conferences.

On March 14, 2006, due to the harsh financial circumstances it was facing, the Hokkaidō government decided to request payments for lighting, heating, water and other costs, totaling approximately 2.5 million yen, from the , starting from the new financial year.

One of the biggest moves against the kisha clubs came in the autumn of 2009, when the opposition Democratic Party (Japan, 1998) took power from the long-governing LDP. The new prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, opened press conferences at the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office to non-kisha club reporters from domestic and foreign media, declaring he would &quot;make press conferences more open to everyone.&quot; Press conferences at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were also opened to non-kisha club members of the press. However, when the new financial services minister, Shizuka Kamei, tried to open press conferences at his agency, the Financial Services Agency, the kisha club resisted so ferociously that he was forced to compromise. In an odd arrangement, he gave two back-to-back press conferences, one to the kisha club, and one open to all other journalists. &quot;Japan’s news media are closed,&quot; Kamei said during one of the non-kisha club press conferences. “They think they are the only real journalists, but they are wrong.”

=== Nagano Prefecture&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of the End of Our Kisha Club System&quot; ===
On May 15, 2001, former mayor of Nagano, Yasuo Tanaka, announced a &quot;Declaration of the End of Our Kisha Club System&quot;. He closed the three kisha clubs within the prefectural offices, and opened a press center which anyone could use, called the .

The purpose of this was to end the monopoly of the large media companies on information; however, it was fiercely criticized by these companies, and it is reported that this action has resulted in a feud with large media companies both inside and outside the prefecture.

On October 3, 2006, the current mayor, Hitoshi Murai, announced that the &quot;Expression Center&quot; would be renamed the . In the same way as Tanaka, he allowed members of the public to participate in conferences, subject to submitting an application.


== Major kisha clubs ==
In addition to the kisha clubs listed below, there are clubs for the government of each prefecture.
* - The kisha club within the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In principle, companies make announcements about events which are likely to have a major effect on share prices at this club.
* - The kisha club of the former Japanese National Railways. At present, it is based at the head offices of JR East. As most reporters concerned with transport normally work at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, few are permanently stationed at the Tokiwa club. During his time as a reporter with the Asahi Shimbun, Naoki Tanemura belonged to the club, and the fiction he wrote as a railway writer contained several names which were variations on the name &quot;Tokiwa&quot;.
* - The kisha club of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Reporters from the mass media in Japan and overseas are stationed here.
* - This kisha club was formed from a union of the clubs for the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Construction and National Land Agency. Its nature as a combination of different groups can often be observed; for example, a reporter covering traffic policy may be sitting next to a reporter covering the disposal of debts by general construction companies.
* - A kisha club at the Japan Iron and Steel Federation in Chūō, Tokyo. Despite its location, resident reporters cover a range of industries, including metals other than steel, chemistry, textiles, rubber, paper, glass, cosmetics, personal care goods (such as those from Lion or Kao), pharmaceuticals and apparel. It has the widest range of areas covered of any kisha club. Because of its name, it is often wrongly thought to be a club covering businesses such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries or Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries.
* - A club in Honseki-chō, Nihonbashi, Tokyo, which serves as a base for reporters covering the textile and paper industries. It is not an official club, but a subdivision of the heavy industries club, with which it merged in 2002.
* - This is a club within the Bank of Japan, whose resident reporters cover not only the Bank itself but also private organizations such as banks and insurance agencies.
* - Initially, this was a subdivision of the Keidan Kikai Club, but became a club in its own right when the Kikai Club closed in 1999. However, the four major newspapers, the Nikkei, Asahi, Yomiuri and Mainichi, decided not to participate in it, it is not recognized as a kisha club by the Newspaper Association. The Nikkan Jidosha Shimbun, which is not a member of the Newspaper Association, is a resident company at the automobile club.
* - The kisha club at the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Marunouchi, Tokyo. This club was established with the aim of allowing the mass media to report on small businesses. However, in practice, there is next to no reporting on small businesses, and instead it is a base for reporting on the delivery, service, non-banking financial and food businesses. The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry has repeatedly expressed discontent about this, and asked for it to be used to report on small businesses, but this has not come about. For this reason, the relationship between the media and the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry concerning the running of the club has not always been a close one, and there have often been rumors that the club may close.
* - A kisha club within the official residence of the Japanese Prime Minister. In recent times, it has often been referred to as the , but its official name is . Reporters belonging to this club report mainly on the prime minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary, Deputy Cabinet Secretary, the official residence and the cabinet.
* - A club at the House of Representatives in the National Diet with the six Tokyo television stations (NHK, Nippon TV, TBS, Fuji TV, TV Asahi and TV Tokyo) as members. It is the only club in Japan which is exclusively for television news camera operators.
* - A club within the House of Representatives which is exclusively for radio news journalists. Its official name is the . It is mainly used for recording press conferences (). NHK is not a member of this club, as its radio news broadcasts use the audio from its television news broadcast.
* - A kisha club with offices inside the headquarters of the LDP and at the House of Representatives. The reporters belonging to this club report mainly on the LDP and New Komeito. The club inside the LDP headquarters is referred to as , and the club at the House of Representatives is known as . Reporters from the Hirakawa generally attend the club at the House when the Diet is in session, and the HQ when it is out of session.
* - A club at the House of Representatives in the National Diet. Reporters at this club cover mainly the Democratic Party of Japan, Japanese Communist Party and Social Democratic Party
* - Tokyo Metropolitan Police kisha clubs Television reporters often say they are reporting &quot;from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police kisha club&quot;, but this is not technically correct. Ignoring the industry newspaper, there are three kisha clubs at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The Asahi, Mainichi, Yomiuri, Tokyo, Nikkei and Kyōdō news companies are members of the , which means &quot;club of seven companies&quot;, as the Jiji Shinpō newspaper was once also a member. This club has the longest history of any of the clubs at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The NHK, Sankei, Jiji, Nippon Broadcasting, Nippon Cultural Broadcasting and MXTV companies are members of the . This is the smallest club, and in practice only the first three of these companies are resident. The five private broadcasters, Nippon TV, TBS, Fuji TV, TV Asahi and TV Tokyo, are members of the . These three clubs are run separately, with separate accounts.
* - Since this is run by the reporters from the police kisha clubs, in practice there are no companies resident here.
* - A kisha club related to the labor movement. In former times, organizations such as the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan provided information, and member newspaper and magazine reporters worked here. At present the Japanese Trade Union Confederation is involved. As two of the news companies, Rodo Joho and Akahata reported on the massive debt incident and the trade union budget spending incident, by the former Japan Postal Workers&#x27; Union (now the JPU), the Postal Workers&#x27; Union blocked them from becoming members.

==Kisha clubs in other countries==
In South Korea, there had been similar clubs to the japanese kisha club system. But since reforms implemented in the early 2000s this system no longer exists between the South Korean government and media. These reforms include change by the media itself, such as the event on June 11, 2001 when 11 local newspapers attending government offices in Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do, including the &quot;Kyongin Ilbo&quot; and &quot;Jeonmae&quot;, disbanded the club and withdrew from the conference room, and events such as that in the same year, where the internet newspaper OhmyNews was expelled from a press conference at Incheon International Airport, and issued a lawsuit appealing against its expulsion.

In 2003, due to a policy by President Roh Moo-hyun the press club at the Presidential residence, the Blue House, was disbanded. A conference room open to internet media and foreign media organizations set up so that anyone who registers can attend.

In America, while there are a few clubs which are relatively similar to Japanese kisha clubs, such as the club in the Department of Defense, unlike Japan these have a salon atmosphere. At the White House, there are secret meetings known as &quot;briefings&quot;, to which only specific members of the major mass media companies are invited. However, beside these, there are also press conferences, which any journalist issued with a press pass can attend. On the other hand, in order to obtain a press pass, journalists have to undergo strict security checks from all departments, and the process can take several months. Recently, bloggers reporting news from internet blogs have been issued press passes, which attracted much attention, but it was also found that a reporters from a conservative news website was also running an illegal pornography website, provoking criticism in that the security checks were not good enough to discover the reporter&#x27;s illegal transactions.

In the United Kingdom, until recently only reporters with press passes for the Houses of Parliament were allowed to attend briefings, but since Tony Blair took power, freelance journalists have been allowed to participate. In addition, before this reform, briefings were treated as being off the record.

In France, any journalist may be issued with a press card, but in order to receive this, journalists must undergo an investigation by the &quot;press card committee&quot; which issues the cards. With this card, a journalist can enter the President&#x27;s residence (the Élysée Palace) and attend press conferences at any Ministry.

== Other details ==
Many of the kisha clubs in Japan hold joint informal events (such as end-of-year parties, summer parties and leaving parties) with local government agencies or company publicity departments. This is not illegal, but it is inappropriate behavior for journalists. It is said that the smaller the kisha club, the more pronounced this tendency is.

In 2002, when reports were made about the problem of (the so-called secret Cabinet fund), it was discovered that at end-of-year parties, New Year parties and at the start of holiday tours, the Chief Cabinet Secretary handed to reporters, and this was paid for from the Cabinet Payment Fund.

In 2005, it was found by the city council of Tatebayashi City that the lunches at the regular press conferences held by the mayor of Tatebayashi City and media companies was paid for from public expenses. The city announced the intention of ending these payments.

<doc id="1107345" wikidata="Q941535" url="?curid=1107345" title="Repression of science in the Soviet Union">
<text>Many fields of scientific research in the Soviet Union were banned or suppressed with various justifications. All humanities and social sciences were tested for strict accordance with dialectical materialism. These tests served as a cover for political suppression of scientists who engaged in research labeled as &quot;idealistic&quot; or &quot;bourgeois&quot;. Many scientists were fired, others were arrested and sent to Gulags. The suppression of scientific research began during the Stalin era and continued after his death.

The ideologically motivated persecution damaged many fields of Soviet science.

== Examples ==

=== Biology ===

In the mid-1930s, the agronomist Trofim Lysenko started a campaign against genetics and was supported by Stalin. If the field of genetics&#x27; connection to Nazis wasn&#x27;t enough, Mendelian genetics was also suppressed due to beliefs that it was &quot;bourgeoisie science&quot; and its association with the priest Gregor Mendel due to hostility to religion because of the Soviet policy of state atheism.

In 1950, the Soviet government organized the Joint Scientific Session of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, the &quot;Pavlovian session&quot;. Several prominent Soviet physiologists (L.A. Orbeli, P.K. Anokhin, , Ivane Beritashvili) were accused of deviating from Pavlov&#x27;s teaching. As a consequence of the Pavlovian session, Soviet physiologists were forced to accept a dogmatic ideology; the quality of physiological research deteriorated and Soviet physiology excluded itself from the international scientific community. Later Soviet biologists heavily criticised Lysenko&#x27;s theories and pseudo-scientific methods.

=== Cybernetics ===

Cybernetics was also outlawed as bourgeois pseudoscience during Stalin&#x27;s reign. Norbert Wiener&#x27;s 1948 book was condemned and translated only in 1958. A 1954 edition of the &quot;Brief Philosophical Dictionary&quot; condemned cybernetics for &quot;mechanistically equating processes in live nature, society and in technical systems, and thus standing against materialistic dialectics and modern scientific physiology developed by Ivan Pavlov&quot;. (However this article was removed from the 1955 reprint of the dictionary.) After an initial period of doubts, Soviet cybernetics took root, but this early attitude hampered the development of computing in the Soviet Union.

=== History ===

Soviet historiography (the way in which history was and is written by scholars of the Soviet Union) was significantly influenced by the strict control by the authorities aimed at propaganda of communist ideology and Soviet power.

Since the late 1930s, Soviet historiography treated the party line and reality as one and the same. As such, if it was a science, it was a science in service of a specific political and ideological agenda, commonly employing historical negationist methods. In the 1930s, historic archives were closed and original research was severely restricted. Historians were required to pepper their works with references – appropriate or not – to Stalin and other &quot;Marxist-Leninist classics&quot;, and to pass judgment – as prescribed by the Party – on pre-revolution historic Russian figures.

Many works of Western historians were forbidden or censored, many areas of history were also forbidden for research as, officially, they never happened. Translations of foreign historiography were often produced in a truncated form, accompanied with extensive censorship and corrective footnotes. For example, in the Russian 1976 translation of Basil Liddell Hart&#x27;s &quot;History of the Second World War&quot; pre-war purges of Red Army officers, the secret protocol to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, many details of the Winter War, the occupation of the Baltic states, the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Western Allied assistance to the Soviet Union during the war, many other Western Allies&#x27; efforts, the Soviet leadership&#x27;s mistakes and failures, criticism of the Soviet Union and other content were censored out.

Of note was the ban of the theory about the Varangian origin of Kievan Rus for ideological reasons.

===Linguistics===
At the beginning of Stalin&#x27;s rule, the dominant figure in Soviet linguistics was Nikolai Yakovlevich Marr, who argued that language is a class construction and that language structure is determined by the economic structure of society. Stalin, who had previously written about language policy as People&#x27;s Commissar for Nationalities, read a letter by Arnold Chikobava criticizing the theory. He &quot;summoned Chikobava to a dinner that lasted from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. taking notes diligently.&quot; In this way he grasped enough of the underlying issues to oppose this simplistic Marxist formalism, ending Marr&#x27;s ideological dominance over Soviet linguistics. Stalin&#x27;s principal work in the field was a small essay, &quot;Marxism and Linguistic Questions.&quot;

The term &quot;semiotics&quot; was banned, and the researchers used the obfuscated term &quot;secondary modeling systems&quot; () coined by Juri Lotman and Vladimir Uspensky in 1964; see Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School.

=== Pedology ===
Pedology was a popular area of research on the basis of numerous orphanages created after the Russian Civil War. Soviet pedology was a combination of pedagogy and psychology of human development, that heavily relied on various tests. It was officially banned in 1936 after a special decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union &quot;On Pedolodical Perversions in the Narkompros System&quot; on July 4, 1936.

===Physics===
In the late 1940s, some areas of physics, were also criticized on grounds of &quot;idealism&quot;.

In quantum mechanics Soviet physicists Dmitry Blokhintsev, Yaakov Terletsky and K. V. Nikolsky developed a version of the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics, which was seen as more adhering to the principles of dialectical materialism. 

Special and general relativity were a matter of controversy among the Soviet scientists since 1920. Some of them argued that this theory is grounded in Machism (acutely criticized by Vladimir Lenin in his &quot;Materialism and Empiriocriticism&quot;), others were a group of so-called &quot;mechanists&quot; (see ), later &quot;Young Stalinists&quot; joined the ranks of the relativity theory. At the same time a considerable number of prominent Soviet physicists defended the relativity theory. The attacks on the relativity theory intensified in 1949 under the auspices of the struggle against the &quot;physical idealism&quot; in the work of Leonid Mandelstam. Initially Sergey Vavilov, President of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, managed to defend Mandelstam, but in 1952 the political attacks on &quot;reactionary Einsteinianism&quot; intensified further. This pseudoscientific campaign sizzled after the death of Stalin. 

Although initially planned, the process of &quot;ideological cleansing&quot; in physics did not go as far as defining an &quot;ideologically correct&quot; version of physics and purging those scientists who refused to conform to it, because this was recognized as potentially too harmful to the Soviet nuclear program. During 1949-1951 there was &quot;antiresonance campaign&quot; against the theory of resonance, during which scientists who supported it were accused of &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; sympathies and repressed. As Anna Krylov writes on the perils of ideological intrusion into science, &quot;Stalin rolled back the planned campaign against physics and instructed Beria to give physicists some space; this led to significant advances and accomplishments by Soviet scientists in several domains. However, neither Stalin nor the subsequent Soviet leaders were able to let go of the controls completely. Government control over science turned out to be a grand failure, and the attempt to patch the widening gap between the West and the East by espionage did not help. Today Russia is hopelessly behind the West in both technology and quality of life.&quot;


=== Sociology ===
After the Russian Revolution, sociology was gradually &quot;politicized, Bolshevisized and eventually, Stalinized&quot;. In 1920s a position had formed in the Soviet Union that historical materialism is in fact Marxist sociology, and the major discussion was whether to use the terms &quot;sociology&quot; and &quot;historical materialism&quot; synonymously or to abandon the term &quot;sociology&quot; altogether and consider it to be an anti-Marxist bourgeois science. From 1930s to 1950s, the independent discipline of sociology virtually ceased to exist in the Soviet Union. Even in the era where it was allowed to be practiced, and not replaced by Marxist philosophy, it was always dominated by Marxist thought; hence sociology in the Soviet Union and the entire Eastern Bloc represented, to a significant extent, only one branch of sociology: Marxist sociology. With the death of Joseph Stalin and the 20th Party Congress in 1956, restrictions on sociological research were somewhat eased, and finally, after the 23rd Party Congress in 1966, sociology in Soviet Union was once again officially recognized as an acceptable branch of science.

=== Reliability of data ===

The quality (accuracy and reliability) of data published in the Soviet Union and used in historical research is another issue raised by various Sovietologists. The Marxist theoreticians of the Party considered statistics as a social science; hence many applications of statistical mathematics were curtailed, particularly during the Stalin era. Under central planning, nothing could occur by accident. The law of large numbers and the idea of random deviation were decreed as &quot;false theories&quot;. Statistical journals and university departments were closed; world-renowned statisticians like Andrey Kolmogorov and Eugen Slutsky abandoned statistical research.

As with all Soviet historiography, reliability of Soviet statistical data varied from period to period. The first revolutionary decade and the period of Stalin&#x27;s dictatorship both appear highly problematic with regards to statistical reliability; very little statistical data was published from 1936 to 1956 (&quot;see&quot; Soviet Census (1937)). The reliability of data improved after 1956 when some missing data was published and Soviet experts themselves published some adjusted data for Stalin&#x27;s era; however the quality of documentation deteriorated.

While on occasion statistical data useful in historical research might have been completely &quot;invented&quot; by the Soviet authorities, there is little evidence that most statistics were significantly affected by falsification or insertion of false data with the intent to confound the West. Data was however falsified both during collection – by local authorities who would be judged by the central authorities based on whether their figures reflected the central economy prescriptions – and by internal propaganda, with its goal to portray the Soviet state in most positive light to its very citizens. Nonetheless, the policy of not publishing, or simply not collecting, data that was deemed unsuitable for various reasons was much more common than simple falsification; hence there are many gaps in Soviet statistical data. Inadequate or lacking documentation for much of Soviet statistical data is also a significant problem.

<text>The U.S. House Committee on Armed Services, commonly known as the House Armed Services Committee or HASC, is a standing committee of the United States House of Representatives. It is responsible for funding and oversight of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Armed Forces, as well as substantial portions of the Department of Energy. Its regular legislative product is the National Defense Authorization Act, which has been passed by Congress and signed into law each year since 1962.

==Jurisdiction==
The Armed Services Committee has jurisdiction over defense policy generally, ongoing military operations, the organization and reform of the Department of Defense and Department of Energy, counter-drug programs, acquisition and industrial base policy, technology transfer and export controls, joint interoperability, the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, Department of Energy nonproliferation programs, and detainee affairs and policy.

==History==

The Armed Services Committee was created by the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which consolidated the functions of two predecessor committees: the Committee on Military Affairs and the Committee on Naval Affairs, which were established as standing committees in 1822. Another predecessor, the Committee on the Militia, was created in 1835 and existed until 1911 when it was abolished and its jurisdiction transferred to the Committee on Military Affairs. When Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in 1994, the committee was renamed the Committee on National Security. It was later renamed the Committee on Armed Services.

<doc id="1107354" wikidata="Q832580" url="?curid=1107354" title="Tempting Heart">
<text>Tempting Heart () is a 1999 movie, directed and co-written by Sylvia Chang, starring Takeshi Kaneshiro and Gigi Leung as a pair of onscreen lovers.

The film has a notable theme song &quot;Xin Dong&quot;, performed by Shino Lin Xiao Pei. This song became a radio hit and can still be frequently heard on the radio or at karaoke bars/boxes.

The success of this film prompted director Johnnie To to cast Gigi Leung and Takeshi Kaneshiro in his 2003 film &quot;Turn Left Turn Right&quot;.

==Plot==

Sylvia Chang plays a director who intends to make a romance film and begins to wonder about the role fate plays in relationships. She ends up re-examining her own first love in a completely different light. The story is set in two different periods of time, one in the 1970s where Gigi plays the teenage Xiao-rou, and the other in the 1990s where Sylvia plays the older Xiao-rou.

Takeshi Kaneshiro plays the role of a shy teenager, Ho-jun, who falls in love with Xiao-rou (played by Gigi Leung). Their relationship turns intimate but faces fierce objections from their parents. Karen Mok plays Chen-li, Xiao-rou&#x27;s best friend, whom Xiao-rou confides in.

This teenage love soon fizzles out owing to misunderstandings and Ho-jun, after many years, turns to marry Chen-li. One day, Chen-li reveals that she is a lesbian and that they both love the same girl - Xiao-rou.

Ho-jun meets Xiao-rou on a trip to Japan and upon knowing that Ho-jun is already married, Xiao-rou returns home and gets herself engaged. Ho-jun manages a last attempt to reunite with Xiao-rou by flying to Hong Kong and telling her that he is already a divorcee, but it is to no avail.

Years later, Xiao-rou finds out that Ho-jun&#x27;s wife was actually Chen-li. She discovers this only after Chen-li has died. Chen-li leaves a message for Xiao-rou asking her for forgiveness. As Xiao rou prepares to fly back to Hong Kong from Japan, she receives a present from Ho-jun. In the box were photographs, taken when Ho-jun was thinking about Xiao-rou and of their brief moments of happiness.

It is only at the end of the film when it is tactfully revealed that the director Sylvia Chang was actually re-enacting her own teenage romance.

<doc id="1107363" wikidata="Q5505857" url="?curid=1107363" title="Front engine dragster">
<text>The front-engine dragster is a type of racing car purposely built for drag racing. Commonly known as a &quot;rail&quot;, &quot;digger&quot;, or &quot;slingshot&quot;, it is now considered obsolete, and is used only in nostalgia drag racing. Wheelbases ranged from .

== History ==
The front-engine dragster was an evolution from earlier front-engine hot rods and initially was a car from which all non-essential parts, including the body, had been removed to reduce weight, making the earliest dragsters essentially a production car chassis with a &quot;souped-up&quot; engine. These early dragsters were nicknamed &quot;rails&quot;, due to the frame&#x27;s longitudinal members (rails) being exposed to view. As the dragster design further evolved, the rear suspension was eliminated to reduce weight and enhance traction. More development resulted as builders started fabricating custom frames optimized for drag racing, with driver crash protection being integral to the frame.

With the transition from stripped-down production frames to purpose-built ones, the engine was moved rearward so more of its weight would be on the rear (driving) wheels for increased traction. Rearward positioning of the engine meant the driver had to be moved rearward as well, and in the final version of the front-engine dragster, the driver was positioned behind the rear axle at the very rear of the car. The arrangement of rearward engine mounting and the driver being behind the rear axle gave rise to the colloquial name &quot;slingshot.&quot; Mickey Thompson is credited with introducing the slingshot design in 1954; it would become the dominant dragster design until the early 1970s.

In the quest to develop more driving traction, there were several dragsters built with four rear drive wheels, including cars by Art Chrisman (along with his brother, Lloyd, and partner Frank Cannon), Bill Coburn, and Eddie Hill. (Coburn and the Chrisman brothers used twin engines, also.). None of these four-wheel designs bore fruit; the development of tires designed specifically for drag racing made four wheels unnecessary.

In keeping with the austere nature of a dragster, the heavy cranking motor and battery needed to start the engine were two of the items removed to save weight, requiring that the dragster be push-started. This procedure was necessary until 1976, when the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) mandated that all cars be capable of being started without pushing. As many dragsters had no reverse gear—indeed, many had no transmission at all—cars would have to be pushed back by crews after a burnout; this persisted until NHRA mandated in 1980 that all cars be capable of reversing under their own power.

The slingshot dragster&#x27;s tail-heavy design, coupled with no rear suspension and steadily-increasing engine power, often resulted in high-speed control problems that led to crashes. By the late 1950s, dragster power had increased to where tire-smoking wheelspin would occur over a considerable distance, resulting in a tendency for the car to suddenly drift out of control—the tail-heavy design of the slingshot made recovery difficult. As tire technology improved, wheelstands became a problem and often had to be counteracted by attaching ballast to the front axle, sometimes hundreds of pounds&#x27; worth. Occasionally, the slingshot&#x27;s propensity for doing a wheelie would result in a car completely flipping over, in what is now referred to as a &quot;blowover.&quot; For example, this happened to Jim Nicoll at the 1970 NHRA Nationals due to a clutch failure. Some racers, such as Ronnie Scrima (on his &quot;Scrimaliner&quot;) and Tony Nancy, experimented with a small, inverted wing on the front axle, taking advantage of aerodynamic forces generated at speed to keep the front wheels firmly on the pavement.

Marginal control wasn&#x27;t the only danger with the slingshot design. As the exposed engine was directly in front of the driver&#x27;s compartment, he or she was vulnerable to being showered with hot oil, flying debris and burning fuel due to catastrophic engine or supercharger failure. Adding to the danger was that the driver&#x27;s legs and feet were alongside the driveline. Driveline components, especially the clutch and flywheel assembly, could burst at high engine rpm, resulting in serious or fatal injuries from the violent expulsion of metal fragments.

The slingshot&#x27;s numerous drawbacks led to several attempts at developing rear-engined dragsters, initially none successful. It was when Don Garlits introduced his rear-engined &quot;Swamp Rat XIV&quot; dragster in 1971 that the front-engine slingshot was finally supplanted (technically, Garlits&#x27; dragster was mid-engine; a true rear-engine layout would have the engine mounted behind the rear axle). Garlits designed the car while in the hospital recovering from a partial amputation of his foot when his slingshot&#x27;s two-speed transmission burst and cut the car in two.

<doc id="1107364" wikidata="Q8062265" url="?curid=1107364" title="Yuzpe regimen">
<text>The Yuzpe regimen is a method of emergency contraception that uses a combination of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, specifically 1 mg of norgestrel (or 0.50mg of levonorgestrel) and 100 mcg of ethinyl estradiol ASAP and again in 12 hrs. It is less effective and less commonly used than a larger dose of levonorgestrel alone, a dose of ulipristal acetate, or insertion of a copper intrauterine device. It is designed to be used within 72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse because it works by inhibiting ovulation.

Typically, the Yuzpe regimen uses several doses of combined oral contraceptive pills. It may be preferred in locations where other forms of emergency contraception are unavailable or accessing emergency contraception carries a societal stigma. In these places, people often self-administer combined oral contraceptives as emergency contraception.

Subsequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) undertook an investigation into the use of progestogen-only tablets as an Emergency Hormonal Contraceptive (i.e. without any estrogen component). This showed greater efficacy with reduced side effects and has therefore superseded the Yuzpe method. A single dose of 100 mg mifepristone is also more effective than the Yuzpe regime.

==History==
The method was first developed by Canadian Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology A. Albert Yuzpe as a method of reducing potential unwanted pregnancies, including pregnancy from rape. He published the first studies demonstrating the method&#x27;s safety and efficacy in 1974.

<text>Langdon Warner (1881–1955) was an American archaeologist and art historian specializing in East Asian art. He was a professor at Harvard and the Curator of Oriental Art at Harvard&#x27;s Fogg Museum. He is reputed to be one of the models for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Indiana Jones. As an explorer/agent at the turn of the 20th century, he studied the Silk Road. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1927.

==Career==
Warner graduated from Harvard College in 1903 with a specialty in Buddhist art and an interest in archeology. After several field trips to Asia, he returned to Harvard, where he taught the university&#x27;s first courses in Japanese and Chinese art. The Smithsonian Institution sent him to Asia in 1913, and he spent more than a year there, but World War I interrupted his work. In 1922 the Fogg Museum again sent him to China.

Langdon Warner&#x27;s work in China is the subject of much controversy among art historians. On the one side, there are those who say that he pillaged sites in Asia of their art, in particular, frescos from the Mogao caves at Dunhuang. In 1922, the Fogg Museum sent Warner to China to explore western China. He arrived at the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang in January 1924 and, armed with a special chemical solution for detaching wall-paintings, he removed twenty-six Tang dynasty masterpieces from caves 335, 321, 323 &amp; 320. Warner first applied the chemical solution (strong glue) to the painting on the cave wall. He then placed a cloth against it. The cloth was then pulled away from the fresco and then he applied plaster of Paris on the back of the painting and transferred the painting to the plaster surface. Warner had found evidence that the caves were the object of vandalism by Russian soldiers and reached an agreement with the local people to purchase the frescoes and remove them in order to save them for posterity. Unfortunately, the removal process resulted in some damage to the site itself. Luckily, frescoes he framed with glue but were unable to remove are still on display in the caves today. Only five of the 26 fragments of murals that he removed are in good enough condition to be exhibited now in the Harvard Art Museums, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Another object of significance removed included a Kneeling Bodhisattva from Cave 328.

The views of the Chinese government towards Warner have varied as intensively as the government itself over the last century. In 1931, the National Commission for the Preservation of Antiquities declared that archeological objects could only be taken from the country if there is no one in the country &quot;sufficiently competent or interested in studying or safe-keeping them.&quot; Otherwise, the Commission concluded, it is no longer scientific archeology but commercial vandalism.&quot; Warner himself viewed his work as a heroic act of preserving art from destruction. He defended taking fragments from the Longmen Grottoes, saying &quot;If we are ever criticized for buying those chips, the love and labor and the dollars we spent on assembling them should silence all criticism. That in itself is a service to the cause of China bigger than anyone else in this country has ever made.&quot; It is worth noting, though, that most of the destruction was done to fill orders placed by western collectors using images provide by the buyers.

Today the caves in Dunhuang are favored as tourist stops to showcase the Chinese view that the Americans pillaged their heritage. Certain members of the family have requested that the museum return the pieces to Dunhuang. The museum&#x27;s position is that since they have a bill of sale indicating that Warner legitimately purchased the artwork, they have no obligation to return them. The Warner family acknowledges both points of view on the matter and seeks resolution. 
==World War II==
Warner&#x27;s archaeological career was interrupted by the United States&#x27; entry into World War II and he became part of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) Section of the U.S. Army. He was brought on as an advisor to the MFAA Section in Japan from April to September 1946.

He has been given credit by some for advising against firebombing and the use of the atomic bomb on Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura and other ancient cities to protect cultural heritage of Japan. There are monuments erected in Kyoto, Hōryū-ji (outside the western edge of Hōryū-ji temple), Sakurai, Nara at Abe Monju-in Temple and Kamakura (outside Kamakura JR Station) in his honor for this reason. However, Otis Cary has argued that the credit for sparing Japan&#x27;s cultural heritage sites belongs not to Langdon but to the U.S. Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson.

<doc id="1107372" wikidata="Q3546587" url="?curid=1107372" title="Manchester Black">
<text>Manchester Black is a fictional character in American comic books published by DC Comics, in particular those featuring Superman. He was created by Joe Kelly and Doug Mahnke in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #775 (March 2001). Introduced as an antihero, the character later becomes a supervillain.

David Ajala portrays Manchester Black in &quot;Supergirl&quot;.

==Fictional character biography==
Manchester Black is the leader of a team of super-powered antiheroes called the Elite, who gain popularity for viciously killing their foes. Superman battles the Elite before killing their members and temporarily depowering Black by damaging his brain. Following this, Black&#x27;s sister Vera assumes leadership of the Elite&#x27;s remants.

In &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot;, Black regains his powers and joins the Suicide Squad to recruit Doomsday and battle Imperiex. Later, Black battles Superman before realizing the error of his ways and committing suicide.

Black is resurrected in &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot and depicted as a high-ranking S.T.A.R. Labs executive. He later works with Superman to save Earth from the Phantom Zone criminals and uses his powers to erase the public&#x27;s knowledge of Superman&#x27;s identity, killing him in the process.

==Powers and abilities==
Black is a powerful telekinetic and telepath. He can create detailed illusions on a vast scale, erase memories, and could telepathically control thousands of minds at the same time. While controlling Bizarro and Silver Banshee, he was able to temporarily grant them enough sanity to enable them to communicate and form plans.

== In other media ==

<doc id="1107376" wikidata="Q974125" url="?curid=1107376" title="Jason Bay">
<text>Jason Raymond Bay (born September 20, 1978) is a Canadian-American former professional baseball left fielder who played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). Initially drafted by the Montreal Expos, he played for the San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets and Seattle Mariners.

Bay was the National League Rookie of the Year in 2004 and he won the Silver Slugger Award in 2009. He is a three-time MLB All-Star and a three-time Tip O&#x27;Neill Award winner as the best Canadian baseball player.

==Amateur career==
In youth baseball, Bay&#x27;s Trail little league team reached the 1990 Little League World Series. Bay attended North Idaho College in Coeur d&#x27;Alene and Gonzaga University in Spokane, where he played college baseball from 1997-2000 In 1999, he played for the Chatham Athletics in the Cape Cod Baseball League.

==Professional career==

===Minor league career (2000–2002)===
Bay was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the 22nd round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft and was assigned to the Expos&#x27; Short-Season A team in Burlington, Vermont, the Vermont Expos. In , Bay was assigned to the Expos’ High Single-A team in the Florida State League, the Jupiter Hammerheads. He began the year slowly, and in May was moved to the Clinton LumberKings of the Midwest League, where Bay reached base in his first 26 games, then went on to bat .362 and win the league batting title. In all, he batted .315 with 14 home runs and 75 runs batted in on the year.

The Expos traded Bay to the New York Mets on March 24, 2002, with Jimmy Serrano for Lou Collier. At the trading deadline on July 31, 2002, the Mets traded Bay to the San Diego Padres with Josh Reynolds and Bobby Jones for Jason Middlebrook and Steve Reed.

===Major league career===

====San Diego Padres (2003)====
Bay debuted with the Padres on May 23, 2003, getting his first major league hit, a home run, in the ninth inning. Two days later, he suffered a broken right wrist after being hit by a pitch.

====Pittsburgh Pirates (2003–2008)====

On August 26, 2003, Bay was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, along with Óliver Pérez and Cory Stewart in exchange for Brian Giles. He finished the season with a .287 batting average, four home runs, and 14 RBI in 30 games.

Bay began the season on the disabled list due to surgery during the offseason, and did not rejoin the team until May. Despite missing the beginning of the season, he still produced the best offensive numbers of any National League rookie. He batted .282 in 120 games, leading all major league rookies in home runs (26) and RBIs (82). He also led all NL rookies in slugging percentage (.550), extra base hits (54) and total bases (226). With his 26 home runs, Bay broke a Pirates rookies record of 23 set by Johnny Rizzo in and matched by Ralph Kiner in . Selected as the 2004 NL Rookie of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, Bay was the second Pittsburgh Pirates player honoured with the award, after second baseman Johnny Ray in 1982. Bay was also the first Canadian player to win the award.

In 2005, Bay was selected to his first All-Star Game as a reserve outfielder. He was the only player on either roster not to appear in the game. Bay also appeared in the 2005 Century 21 Home Run Derby, representing Canada in the nationality-themed contest; he was eliminated in the first round after hitting no home runs. Bay finished the season with a .306 average, 32 home runs, and 101 RBI, leading the Pirates in every major hitting category.

After the 2005 season, Bay signed a four-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $18.25 million.

Bay batted .321 with 12 home runs (a Pirate record for home runs in a month) and 35 RBIs in May 2006. From May 22 to May 28, he hit home runs in six consecutive games, two short of the major league record held by Dale Long, Don Mattingly, and Ken Griffey Jr. He had actually hit 10 home runs in ten games, but he had failed to hit a home run in one of the games, and hit two the next day.

Following an aggressive public relations campaign by the Pirates in 2006, Bay led all National League outfielders in All-Star voting. Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder even urged fans to vote for Bay during a summer concert at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Mellon Arena. Bay became the first member of the Pittsburgh Pirates voted into the All-Star game as a starter since Andy Van Slyke. In the game, Bay went 1-for-3 with a single.

After battling injuries, Bay&#x27;s season was less productive. Despite having a strong first couple of months, he batted .247 with 21 home runs and 84 RBI.

Bay had a much more productive 2008 with Pittsburgh, batting .282 with 22 home runs and 64 RBI through the All-Star break. In a May series against the Chicago Cubs, Bay had extra-inning walk-off hits in back-to-back games; the first two walk-off hits of his career. A month later, he got his third walk-off hit of the season and his career with a 13th-inning solo home run against the Tampa Bay Rays.

====Boston Red Sox (2008–2009)====
On July 31, 2008, Bay and a player to be named later (Josh Wilson) were traded to the Boston Red Sox in a three team deal that sent Manny Ramirez to the Los Angeles Dodgers and Andy LaRoche with Bryan Morris to the Pittsburgh Pirates from the Dodgers and Brandon Moss with Craig Hansen to the Pirates from the Red Sox. In his Red Sox debut, Bay scored both runs, the second coming after he tripled in the bottom of the 12th inning and scored the game-winning run on a Jed Lowrie RBI infield single. Bay hit his first home run with Boston the next night, against the Oakland Athletics. In one game, he hit multiple home runs against the Baltimore Orioles at Oriole Park. Bay would end the 2008 season with Boston batting .293 with nine home runs and 37 RBI.
The Red Sox&#x27; 2008 American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was the first playoff series of Bay&#x27;s career. Bay hit a home run in each of the first two games of the series. Bay finished the series batting 7-for-17 (.412), with two doubles, two home runs, and 5 RBI. In the 2008 American League Championship Series, he scored the first run in game one. In game two, he opened the door for the Red Sox with a two-run double and a home run in the fifth inning. However, the Red Sox lost in seven games.

In 2009, after a strong first half that included an All-Star selection, Bay went on to lead the Red Sox with a career-high 36 home runs and 119 RBI during the regular season. Early in the season, he also had a streak of 11 home runs with men on base, tying the team record and falling one shy of the major league record.

In 2009, he was named #41 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball.

He filed for free agency after the season, turning down the Red Sox&#x27;s offer of salary arbitration.

====New York Mets (2010–2012)====

On December 29, 2009, Bay agreed to a four-year, $66 million contract with the New York Mets, which also included a vesting option for a fifth year. General manager Omar Minaya, who engineered the deal, originally traded Bay to the Mets in 2002 when he was GM for the Montreal Expos. On January 5, 2010, Minaya and Jeff Wilpon held a press conference at Citi Field in which Bay was presented with his uniform, number 44 for the Mets. The Red Sox received the 39th (Anthony Ranaudo) and 57th (Brandon Workman) selections in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft as compensation.

On April 27, in the first game of a double header against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Bay hit his first home run as a member of the New York Mets in the bottom of the fourth inning to give the Mets a 2–0 lead. The Mets went on to win the first game, 4–0, and win the second game, 10–5.

In his first season with the Mets, Bay played in only 95 games. He suffered a concussion in a game against the Dodgers, when he ran into a fenced wall and his head jerked back. He finished his season with a .259 batting average, only six home runs (he hit 36 the year before), 47 RBI, and scored 48 runs.

Bay began 2011 on the disabled list with a rib injury and returned to the Mets on April 21 in a game against the Houston Astros. On that day (a 9–1 Mets win), Bay batted and scored in the eighth on a rare four-base error when Hunter Pence failed to catch Bay&#x27;s fly ball; David Wright, on first base from a walk, scored ahead of him. Bay also had a ground-rule double and scored a run in the fourth inning. On June 28, 2011, Bay hit a grand slam off of Detroit Tigers pitcher Daniel Schlereth. It was the first grand slam by the Mets since Ángel Pagán hit one on August 1, 2009. On August 8, Bay hit his 200th career home run against the San Diego Padres, becoming the third Canadian MLB player after Larry Walker and Matt Stairs to reach this milestone. Bay hit another grand slam in September en route to winning his fifth career National League Player of the Week Award.

Bay got off to a slow start to the 2012 season, finishing spring training with no home runs or RBI, and his regular season, which was derailed further by a broken rib suffered while making a diving catch in the April 23 game against the San Francisco Giants. When Bay returned from the DL on June 8, 2012 against the New York Yankees, he went 0-for-3 with one strikeout. He continued to go 0-for-16 in his return from the DL through June 12, before hitting a single on June 13 against the Tampa Bay Rays. In a home game against the Cincinnati Reds on June 15, Bay left the game in the second inning after crashing into the left field wall and suffering a concussion while attempting to catch a fly ball by Jay Bruce that became an inside-the-park home run. He was subsequently placed on the DL again, and returned again on July 17 against the Washington Nationals. On September 2, Bay hit a grand slam off of Miami Marlins pitcher Mark Buehrle in the first inning of a 5–2 Mets win. Bay also hit a home run off of Buehrle on September 22 in a 4–3 Mets win. Bay finished the 2012 season with a .165 batting average, eight home runs and 20 RBI.

On November 7, 2012, the Mets and Bay agreed to terminate their contract a year early and make the outfielder an unrestricted free agent.

====Seattle Mariners (2013)====

On December 8, 2012, the Seattle Mariners signed Bay to a one-year, $1 million deal. Bay appeared in 68 games with the Mariners and batted .204 with 11 home runs and 20 RBI before being designated for assignment on July 29, 2013. Bay was released on August 6.

On March 31, 2014, Bay officially announced his retirement from professional baseball.

Bay was eligible to be elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2019, but received less than 5% of the vote and became ineligible for the 2020 ballot.

==Personal life==
Bay and his wife, Kristen, have three children.

Bay&#x27;s sister, Lauren Bay-Regula, is a professional softball player who pitched for Canada in the 2004 Olympics, and was on the 2008 Olympic team as well.

Bay remains friends with former NHL centre Shawn Horcoff, who was also born in Trail. He is close friends with Grady Sizemore, who was a groomsman at Bay&#x27;s wedding.

In Bay&#x27;s opening interview with the Boston media, he stated that his father was a die-hard Red Sox fan who had bought him a Red Sox onesie to wear when he was young. Bay believed it was still in his parents&#x27; basement along with his two childhood TV room posters of Red Sox greats Jim Rice and Carl Yastrzemski.

On July 2, 2009, Bay became a US citizen after a ceremony at Faneuil Hall in Boston.

<doc id="1107378" wikidata="Q808235" url="?curid=1107378" title="Bark Psychosis">
<text>Bark Psychosis is an English post-rock band/musical project from east London formed in 1986. They are one of the bands that Simon Reynolds cited when coining &quot;post-rock&quot; as a musical style in 1994, and are thus considered one of the key bands defining the genre. 

In its original form, the group was a quartet of Graham Sutton, Daniel Gish, John Ling and Mark Simnett. This line-up (with contributions from other passing members) recorded early singles and EPs plus the seminal 1994 album &quot;Hex&quot;, before gradually dissolving over the course of 1994, with Sutton moving on to his drum and bass project Boymerang and to production work. Sutton reformed Bark Psychosis in 2004 without any of the other previous members, as a flexible project in which he was supported by a shifting roster of guest musicians (including Talk Talk drummer Lee Harris and experimental guitarist Colin Bradley of Dual). Due to Sutton&#x27;s renewed focus on production work, Bark Psychosis has been inactive since 2005, with no announcements of a final breakup or future plans.

==Sound and influences==

Bark Psychosis&#x27; sound has covered various musical styles including minimalism, introverted indie rock, psychedelia, post-punk, cool jazz, outright mechanical/industrial noise, and electronic dance music. However, the band&#x27;s music is best characterized by a sense of acoustic space, moody atmospherics, murmured vocals, abstract but emotional lyrics, and a particularly sensitive and acclaimed mixture of electronic and acoustic instrumentation. Bark Psychosis is also noted for an extreme dynamic range, varying from quietly-whispered-and-played songs such as &quot;I Know&quot; or &quot;Absent Friend&quot; to thunderous metallic riffing (&quot;Murder City&quot;) or deafening sheets of electric noise (the first half of the track &quot;Hex&quot;).

Bark Psychosis&#x27; music is also notably melodic and expressive, and arguably owes something to the English pastoral rock tradition. The band is frequently embraced by progressive rock fans due to their experimental outlook, and their use of both atmospherics and extended instrumentation. Sutton himself seems uncomfortable with the association, commenting, &quot;Sometimes people compare us to Pink Floyd, and they are just a muso thing. I&#x27;m more interested in feeling, really...&quot;

The band started life as a teenage Napalm Death cover project, reflecting the members&#x27; early interest in extreme noise. Other early influences included Sonic Youth, Talk Talk, Wire, Butthole Surfers, Big Black, Swans and Joy Division. Graham Sutton has claimed a long-term interest in dub, jazz and classical music, as well as an appreciation for the work of Nick Drake.

Bark Psychosis&#x27; musical development has also been characterized by restlessness, which has contributed to the band&#x27;s historical lack of stability while at the same time stimulating its creativity. In another 1994 interview, Sutton stated, &quot;The whole thing about being in this band is never repeating yourself. I&#x27;ve always tried to surprise myself and other people as well, fucking around with people&#x27;s preconceptions about what you&#x27;re about and stuff. I really get a real huge fucking kick about giving people the wrong impression. Or twisting things around. Like, it might sound initially sweet, but it ain&#x27;t. Or vice versa.&quot;

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1988)===

Bark Psychosis was formed in Snaresbrook, Essex in 1986, emerging from the 1980s East London experimental music scene that also produced AR Kane and Disco Inferno. The original two members were schoolfriends Graham Sutton (guitar, vocals) and John Ling (bass, vocals). Both were aged 14 at the time that they started the band, carrying out their initial experiments using a 4-track tape recorder and a drum machine. In January 1988 Ling and Sutton (both aged 16) left school to pursue music full-time. They recruited drummer Mark Simnett, who had previously done community work centered on St John&#x27;s Church, Stratford.

Using Simnett&#x27;s connection with the church, Bark Psychosis arranged rehearsal space for themselves in the crypt of St John&#x27;s, a location that would continue to play an important role in Bark Psychosis&#x27; music. The trio spent the rest of 1988 rehearsing and composing original material, during which time both Sutton and Ling began to dabble in keyboard playing and digital sampling. A few low-key gigs followed late in the year. One of these concerts was attended by Nick Allport and Vinita Joshi of the small East London independent label Cheree Records. Impressed by the band, Cheree immediately offered to release the band&#x27;s first recordings. During this period, Bark Psychosis briefly featured a second guitarist, Rashied Garrison. Garrison had previously played in The Moons, a band who had supported Bark Psychosis at early shows. However, his tenure with Bark Psychosis was fairly short and he would later become &quot;a feared journalist&quot;, the guitarist in Good Time Pony and leader of The Repton Oaks.

===Cheree singles and early live gigs (1988–1990)===

Bark Psychosis&#x27; debut appearance on record was the 1988 &quot;Clawhammer&quot; flexi-disc (a split release on Cheree, shared with Fury Things and Spacemen 3). By this time, the band were back to their original trio lineup. Six years later (on the eve of the release of the &quot;Hex&quot; album), Sutton was vituperative in disowning the track. The official Bark Psychosis debut was 1990&#x27;s 12-inch single &quot;All Different Things/By Blow&quot;, for which the band was augmented by an extra singer, Sue Page. In 1994, Sutton recalled:

&quot;At this stage we were so naive we didn&#x27;t know how things worked, how the whole music business worked. We did two nights of working, from 12 to 8, and gave it to (Cheree)... That&#x27;s the first time we went in the studio properly, really. Basically, I had my hands on the faders and when it kicked in, I just fucking went to the faders, I didn&#x27;t know anything about it then. When we were mixing &quot;By Blow&quot; we ended up distorting the DAT and we didn&#x27;t even fucking notice because it was just monitoring so loud in the control room. It&#x27;s nice, naive and all the rest of it but it&#x27;s pretty crap at the same time.&quot;

The band&#x27;s formal live debut (outside of school performances) was at The Sir George Robey in Finsbury Park, London, supporting Extreme Noise Terror. Tours with The Telescopes, Cranes and Spiritualised quickly followed. In 1990, with Sue Page still on board, Bark Psychosis released a 12-inch EP called &quot;Nothing Feels&quot; (backed with &quot;I Know&quot;). Sutton later recalled, &quot;The second single was what(ever) two tracks we had knocking around at the time. At the same time, live-wise at this stage, it was completely different. It was very, very loud and extreme both ways.&quot;

By this time, Bark Psychosis were establishing a reputation as one of the most unpredictable, innovative live bands in Britain with a great degree of spontaneity and excitement at their gigs. On record, however, they were developing into a more atmospheric and melodic act, while avoiding many of the standard rock &quot;cliches&quot; such as extended solos and self-mythologizing lyrics: beyond their melody lines and rhythms, the band remained abstract and textural. Regarding his musical evolution at the time, Sutton later commented, &quot;For some reason I just flipped one day and I realized silence could have a much greater impact than loud noise... Space and silence are the most important tools you can use in music. I just got really obsessed with that.&quot;

===A year in the wilderness; signing to 3rd Stone Ltd. (1990–1991)===

Having signed a formal recording contract with Cheree, Bark Psychosis immediately found themselves dismayed by management changes at the label. Cheree&#x27;s two new commercial backers were later described by Sutton as &quot;a couple of cons, really, that had screwed so many people,&quot; with links to various dubious businesses including pornography. The band reneged on their contract and spent a year extricating themselves from the situation, during which time Sue Page left the band. Much-needed managerial and financial support during this period was provided by the band&#x27;s friend Rudi Tambala of AR Kane. Sutton has commented: &quot;That year was murder. When we were trying to get away from Cheree it was fucking hell. I had a lot of problems after that year. I was squatting and stuff and did a lot of things I shouldn&#x27;t have done. It&#x27;s caused a lot of problems.&quot;

Eventually, the band&#x27;s contract with Cheree was bought out by 3rd Stone Ltd., the Corby-based alternative record label which had headhunted the band on the reputation of their initial singles. 

===&quot;Manman&quot; EP; The &quot;Scum&quot; single (1992)===

Bark Psychosis&#x27; debut release for 3rd Stone — 1992&#x27;s &quot;Manman&quot; EP — demonstrated clear influences from techno and musique concrète. The band&#x27;s potential had dramatically expanded with the addition of keyboard/synthesizer player Daniel Gish (formerly of Disco Inferno). By now, Sutton and Ling&#x27;s interest in digital sampling and programming had become much more overt. From that point onward, sampling became a major feature of the Bark Psychosis sound, combining with the effect of Gish&#x27;s own influences (which included Kraftwerk, New Order, The The and Dead Can Dance). Sutton was later to comment, &quot;To an extent, every record we make is a reaction to the one that came before it.&quot;

Later in 1992, Bark Psychosis released a hugely acclaimed landmark single called &quot;Scum&quot;. This was an ominous, 21-minute ambient piece improvised and recorded live in the band&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; of St John&#x27;s Church. Recalling the events several years later, Sutton admitted &quot;we had a single to do but we didn&#x27;t have any tracks that were suitable for a single. We wanted to do something completely new and put ourselves under a certain amount of risk. So basically we hired a load of gear and set up sort of a makeshift string and sticky-tape kind of studio under the church where we rehearsed for ages, and in the church as well... We didn&#x27;t have a track when we started, so we just set ourselves ten days to do a 12-inch and that&#x27;s what came out... It&#x27;s probably the most spontaneous record we&#x27;ve put out.&quot;
&quot;Scum&quot; experimented with the use of space and extreme dynamics, with music that varied between minimal jazzy chording, airy acoustic drums, clamorous noise guitar, space-ambience and random vocal snippets. &quot;There was no part except for a few rough galactic idea(s),&quot; Sutton recalled. &quot;That&#x27;s how we&#x27;d written the past few years, just jamming as a band underneath the church. 99.999% of it, you wouldn&#x27;t use any of it; but the vibe was really good at the time, so we decided why not just record a jam sort of thing. That&#x27;s the thing, we tend to try and make life very difficult for ourselves for some reason. I&#x27;m not sure why... Ninety per cent of it was recorded live and then there was a few things. Vocals, some piano, some ambient guitar, a few different samples and stuff. The first three-and-a-half minutes of it was actually just the ambient mics left up. We had recorded a few different takes of things and those distance mics were just left up from a previous jam.&quot;

Regarding the sudden bursts of indistinct speaking voices that punctuated the single, Sutton noted that &quot;that was just a found thing at the church. On one of the nights we were recording there was a Pentecostal meeting going on in the back room, so we sort of sneaked up to their door and just tape-recorded them because it sounded so brilliant.&quot; The single&#x27;s ominous atmosphere and disaffected, whispered lyric &quot;came about as a general disaffection with general sentiments from records that were being shoved down my throat. Crap house tracks. I just remember this one track had this chorus like &quot;Everybody&#x27;s free&quot; and it made me want to fucking puke. I just wanted something completely the opposite of that and (to) turn that sentiment around.&quot;

The single gained the band a lot of press attention (being awarded Single of the Week in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; amongst other plaudits), and demand for an album grew.

===Recording &quot;Hex&quot; (1992–93)===

In November 1992, Bark Psychosis began recording a self-produced debut album, to be called &quot;Hex&quot;. The recording of the album consolidated the ideas which the band had explored on &quot;Scum&quot;. As had been the case with &quot;Scum&quot;, the sessions made extensive use of the natural acoustics of St John&#x27;s Church, with other recording work done in studios in Bath, Brighton and London. In an interview with the Audrie&#x27;s Diary fanzine in 1994, Sutton explained &quot;Most people, to get a big reverb sound, will record something and then run it through a reverb unit. But we&#x27;ve taken the trouble to record in a church... When you set up mics, you capture more than just what is being recorded. You capture an ambience or a feeling as well. It&#x27;s all about creating something unique and of the moment rather than just another bland factory preset.&quot;
In an interview with the Weedbus fanzine at the same time, Sutton commented:

&quot;If you were making a film or something you want to have special effects — for example, a train going over a cliff. Then you either get a little model of it and simulate, or you can get a real train because that&#x27;s probably going to be more effective. We wanted to capture real acoustics rather than have everything computer simulated. A lot of keyboards can sound very bland so you have to look at recording them in a different way. We wanted to have a gritty edge to it. We got a PA and set it up in a church, a really huge church in Stratford, east London, just beside a huge traffic island, so we had to do it late at night when there was no traffic! We had the keyboards coming out of the PA and the microphones at the other end of the church. It created a very interesting atmosphere...&quot;

By this point, the band had developed a singularly unique and varied sound — embedded in lush electronic sampling and textures and accented with electric guitars, piano, and melodica. Regarding the sampling, Sutton commented &quot;although the album doesn&#x27;t sound like it, a good fifty per cent of it was just running from computer... A lot of things. Guitar things. Moving things around, you know, cutting things out, then moving them around. Bits of vocal moved around... There&#x27;s also a lot of samples of instruments involved. But we do it in a way that is idiosyncratic to us... Although &quot;Hex&quot; is sample-orientated, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily sound like that, and there is an acoustic drum-kit in there, recorded in such a way that it sounds quite idiosyncratic to me. The album doesn&#x27;t fit in that well, which I&#x27;m happy about — I wouldn&#x27;t like it to fit in with a homogeneous agenda like dance music, or ambient music, whatever. The area of ambient music interests me more than any other but it&#x27;s still too stylised.&quot; Sutton himself was moving in the direction of electronic music and paying less attention to his guitar playing. &quot;I had a tremolo pedal, a chorus pedal, a delay pedal. That&#x27;s it. But I really haven&#x27;t played much guitar in the last year. I&#x27;ve been mostly fucking around with samplers. I&#x27;m more interested in pure sound, than just a guitar or whatever.&quot;

&quot;Hex&quot; featured guest musicians the Duke String Quartet, Animals That Swim&#x27;s trumpeter Del Crabtree, Phil Brown on flute, and Neil Aldridge and Dave Ross on assorted percussion. The band also called in vibraphone player Pete Beresford (the father of one of Sutton&#x27;s friends), of whom Sutton later recalled &quot;(he) was this really, really old guy who used to play in a lot of old war time swing bands for kids going out for a dance in London. He hadn&#x27;t taken his vibes out of his front room for fucking years, he just plays for his own pleasure, as a hobby. So we got him to come down and it was fucking brilliant, and I want to work with him again.&quot;

The recording of &quot;Hex&quot; proved to be tortuous, with plenty of infighting centered around Sutton&#x27;s stubbornness and dominance of the band. In 2001, Sutton would reminisce &quot;I have great memories of working on (&quot;Hex&quot;), even if I did do everyone&#x27;s head in!&quot; However, in a 1994 interview he described the album sessions as &quot;the most intense fucking year of my life. The longest I had been in a studio was ten days for &quot;Scum&quot;, but this was like a year of my life... It was quite hairy at some points.&quot; The band interrupted the album recording sessions on 31 January 1993, to play a one-off concert at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s jazz club in London. This was to be their last performance together as a quartet.

Two members of Bark Psychosis were to leave the band during the remaining sessions. The first was Daniel Gish, whose departure was formally announced in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; on 18 December 1993. Gish would cite &quot;lack of record company support&quot; as his motive for leaving, with Sutton commenting, &quot;all I can say is the split was amicable,&quot;: he would also describe Gish as having &quot;gone to Israel for a bit. He&#x27;s going to come back though and I still want to work with him.&quot; The last track from the sessions, &quot;Big Shot&quot;, was recorded by the remaining three members. Once &quot;Hex&quot; was completed, John Ling also quit Bark Psychosis, feeling &quot;burnt out and unable to play,&quot; allegedly due to the stress of making the album. At the time, Sutton commented that &quot;(John) felt he just needed to get some distance from it once we&#x27;d finished it. I think he&#x27;s moved to Holland now to do Spiral Tribe or squat over there or something... It&#x27;s just been a fucking intense year, though it might not sound like it on the record. It&#x27;s been a real head-fuck.&quot; Ling would not return to the band. He subsequently quit the music business to spend a period travelling the world, and later pursued a career as a psychiatric nurse as well as starting a family. Many years later, Sutton would admit &quot;I know I can be &#x27;difficult&#x27; to work with; I get very opinionated — and I&#x27;ll fight tooth and nail for what I believe in. John had a problem with that and chose to leave.&quot;

===The release of &quot;Hex&quot; (early 1994)===

In January 1994, the band released &quot;A Street Scene&quot; as a single. Although plans for live concerts had initially been upset by the departure of John Ling, the band carried out a five-date promotional tour with guest musicians including Daniel Gish, who had been invited to rejoin the lineup as a guest musician rather than full band member. The band screened the animated Bolex Brothers film &quot;The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb&quot; rather than use a support act. &quot;Hex&quot; itself was released on 14 February 1994. It was licensed to Circa Records (a division of Virgin Records) and released worldwide through EMI. In the US, the album was released on Caroline Records.

When British music critic Simon Reynolds reviewed the album in the March 1994 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine, he used the term &quot;post-rock&quot; to describe the band&#x27;s approach to music. He later expanded upon the idea in the May 1994 issue of &quot;The Wire&quot;. While this was not the first use of the term, it was the example which brought the &quot;post-rock&quot; concept to public knowledge to the point where it was a major stylistically defining term in music criticism and discourse during the 1990s. This review (and the subsequent discussion which it inspired) ensured that Bark Psychosis were one of the first bands recognised as being post-rock artists. Although &quot;Hex&quot; was not a commercial success at the time, it has continued to sell steadily over the years and retains a reputation as a key album in post-rock and experimental rock circles.

===The &quot;Blue&quot; period — mutation, disintegration and split (mid-1994)===

In March 1994, 3rd Stone released a posthumous Bark Psychosis compilation album called &quot;Independency&quot;. This collected together the early Bark Psychosis singles and EPs on both Cheree and 3rd Stone, and included &quot;Scum&quot; in its entirety.

Now reduced to a duo of Sutton and Simnett, Bark Psychosis went on to record the &quot;Blue&quot; EP, released in May 1994, and promoted with a UK tour, also featuring Gish. The title track was comparatively more upbeat than the band&#x27;s work on &quot;Hex&quot; (and was apparently therapeutic for Sutton, who was allegedly getting over the demise of a &quot;stormy personal relationship&quot; at the time). &quot;Blue&quot; was also very strongly influenced by dance music, sounding closer to a New Order pop single than it did to the moody post-rock of previous releases. The EP also featured a Rudi Tambala remix of the &quot;Hex&quot; track &quot;Big Shot&quot; and (confusingly) a newly recorded track called &quot;Hex&quot;, featuring three-and-a-half minutes of deafening noise textures eventually dissolving into ambient keyboards and trumpet, which was also recorded in St John&#x27;s Church. The EP was mixed at Metropolis Studios in West London.
&quot;Blue&quot; clearly revealed that Sutton&#x27;s interest was now heading towards programmed and sequenced rhythms. By this stage he was asking Simnett to replicate jungle breakbeats at speed on his kit. Bark Psychosis performed at the Britronica Festival in April 1994 in Moscow alongside Seefeel, Autechre, Ultramarine and Aphex Twin. After this concert, an increasingly sidelined Simnett left the band. Six years later, Simnett would resurface in the instrumental post-rock band Yellow6, playing drums for their two live concerts in 2000 and subsequently moving to bass for five concerts in 2001. He would also contribute to Porcupine Tree leader Steven Wilson&#x27;s Incredible Expanding Mindfuck project.

Although Bark Psychosis never formally split up, Simnett&#x27;s departure effectively ended the band, as Sutton had by now lost interest in experimental rock and become a full-scale convert to drum and bass music. In a 2001 interview, Sutton recalled, &quot;By the end it was just me with Mark drumming and a nice pool of different people to draw upon. The last couple of tours we did in &#x27;94 I just loved. But by that point I knew I wanted to try something else.&quot; Later in the summer, Sutton reunited with Daniel Gish to record some new tracks in an ambient and drum and bass style, which they performed at the 1994 Phoenix Festival at Stratford-upon-Avon. Although the duo&#x27;s performance was billed under the Bark Psychosis name (and was technically the band&#x27;s last appearance for ten years), it was in effect the debut of a brand new project which was only tenuously related to Bark Psychosis music.

Later, In 1997, 3rd Stone released a second Bark Psychosis compilation album called &quot;Game Over&quot;, which combined early tracks (as previously released on &quot;Independency&quot;) with the &quot;Blue&quot; single and several tracks from &quot;Hex&quot; including the studio outtake &quot;Murder City&quot;. It also contained a rare cover of the Wire song &quot;Three Girl Rhumba&quot; from the Wire tribute album &quot;Whore&quot;. &quot;Game Over&quot; was not endorsed by the band.

===Post-split – Boymerang, .O.rang, and Sutton as producer (1994–2003)===

Following their Phoenix Festival performance, Sutton and Gish renamed their new drum and bass project Boymerang. The new tracks premiered at Phoenix were released as part of an EP (the first release by The Leaf Label), following which Gish left the project. Following his departure from Boymerang, Daniel Gish disappeared into the world of dance music to work in various mysteriously named subgenres referred to as &quot;dark garage&quot;, &quot;dreamhouse&quot;, and &quot;night music&quot;. Now featuring Sutton alone, Boymerang released several more EPs and an album (1997&#x27;s &quot;Balance Of The Force&quot;). A few musicians from the Bark Psychosis world — most notably trumpeter Del Crabtree — contributed to some tracks.

Sutton also became a significant collaborator to .O.rang, the experimental band formed by former Talk Talk members Lee Harris and Paul Webb. He contributed instrumentation and programming to the &quot;Herd of Instinct&quot; and &quot;Fields And Waves&quot; albums as well as the &quot;Spoor&quot; EP; and remixed the track &quot;P53&quot; for single release.

In parallel to (and subsequent to) his activities with Boymerang and .O.rang, Graham Sutton made a name for himself as a record producer. He has produced albums by Jarvis Cocker, Delays, Snowpony, The Veils, Coldharbourstores, British Sea Power, Pellumair and Anjali Bhatia (ex-Voodoo Queens), plus early recordings by The $urplu$ (a band featuring David Callahan of Moonshake and The Wolfhounds). He has also produced single mixes and remixes for acts including Metallica, Goldie, Brakes, Mansun, Stephen Simmonds, Mandalay, Ed Rush, Collapsed Lung, Ultramarine and Wagon Christ.

===Bark Psychosis mark II (2004–present)===

After a ten-year hiatus, Sutton formally relaunched Bark Psychosis in 2004 and revealed that he had, in fact, been recording new Bark Psychosis tracks since 1999 with various collaborators. The project was now, in effect, a Graham Sutton solo project in all but name, with Sutton playing the majority of the instrumentation himself. Former band drummer Mark Simnett was present, but only in the form of unspecified sampled drum tracks. Sutton&#x27;s most prominent collaborators were now Colin Bradley (better known as the guitarist from Dual) and the former Talk Talk/.O.rang drummer Lee Harris. Other contributors to the project were Anja Buechele (the singer for The $urplu$), bass player David Panos, New Zealand multi-instrumentalist Rachel Dreyer (piano, vocals, wood flute), Shaun Hyder (Sindhi tamboura), Alice Kemp (bowed guitar) and T.J. Mackenzie (trumpet). One of the clearest indications that the project had changed was that Sutton was now sharing his lead singer&#x27;s role with others: Buechele and Dreyer covered many of the vocals, sometimes even singing entire songs. Conversely, a link with the past came from Pete Beresford who contributed vibraphone, reprising his role on &quot;Hex&quot;.
The revitalized Bark Psychosis released a new album, &quot;&quot; on Fire Records in 2004 (accompanied by a new single called &quot;The Black Meat&quot;). &quot;///Codename: Dustsucker&quot; revealed that Bark Psychosis was no longer confined by the formal limitations of either rock band or dance music project, as might have been expected. As opposed to &quot;Hex&quot;&#x27;s more consistent approach (which worked the band&#x27;s influences and ideas around an established rhythm section and melodic instrumentation, and which sounded like the work of an isolated live band with guests), &quot;Dustsucker&quot; was a diverse — even sprawling — collection of musical ideas. Sutton was exploring separate instrumentation from track to track, with the &quot;trademark&quot; Bark Psychosis approach to dynamics and atmosphere serving as the linking project identity. Although several pieces featured familiar Bark Psychosis ingredients (such as the interplay of Sutton&#x27;s tremolo electric guitar and minimal keyboards), others were based around strummed acoustic guitar and resembled either folk music or some of the band&#x27;s pre-&quot;Scum&quot; psychedelic work, while others had elements of cool jazz, Indian classical sounds, or — as in the case of &quot;Shapeshifting&quot; – a post-Boymerang fascination with the possibilities of extended rhythm and noise.

Rather than make new pressings of the &quot;Independency&quot; and &quot;Game Over&quot; albums, 3rd Stone Ltd had apparently already planned to release a new compilation (&quot;Replay&quot;) featuring previously released material, deleted material and unreleased live tracks. Whether by accident or design, &quot;Replay&quot; was released at around the same time as &quot;///Codename: Dustsucker&quot;. As had been the case with &quot;Game Over&quot;, the release was not endorsed by the band. In December 2004, American webzine &quot;Somewhere Cold&quot; voted Bark Psychosis Artist of the Year on their &quot;2004 Somewhere Cold Awards Hall of Fame&quot; list.

In May 2005, Bark Psychosis released the &quot;400 Winters EP&quot;. This featured three &quot;Dustsucker&quot; album tracks &quot;deconstructed and reassembled&quot; by Colin Bradley.

===Current activity===
Bark Psychosis has been dormant since 2005, mainly due to Sutton concentrating on his work as a producer. &quot;Pendulum Man&quot; was featured in the 2008 movie &quot;Definitely, Maybe&quot;.

In July 2017, it was announced that Bark Psychosis&#x27; debut album &quot;Hex&quot; would be reissued on both vinyl and CD on Fire Records.

<doc id="1107385" wikidata="Q574762" url="?curid=1107385" title="Thermal cycler">
<text>The thermal cycler (also known as a thermocycler, PCR machine or DNA amplifier) is a laboratory apparatus most commonly used to amplify segments of DNA via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Thermal cyclers may also be used in laboratories to facilitate other temperature-sensitive reactions, including restriction enzyme digestion or rapid diagnostics. The device has a &quot;thermal block&quot; with holes where tubes holding the reaction mixtures can be inserted. The cycler then raises and lowers the temperature of the block in discrete, pre-programmed steps.

==History==
The earliest thermal cyclers were designed for use with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Since this enzyme is destroyed during each heating step of the amplification process, new enzyme had to be added every cycle. This led to a cumbersome machine based on an automated pipettor, with open reaction tubes. Later, the PCR process was adapted to the use of thermostable DNA polymerase from &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot;, which greatly simplified the design of the thermal cycler. While in some old machines the block is submerged in an oil bath to control temperature, in modern PCR machines a Peltier element is commonly used. Quality thermal cyclers often contain silver blocks to achieve fast temperature changes and uniform temperature throughout the block. Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the reaction tubes are moved between them by means of an automated process. Miniaturized thermal cyclers have been created in which the reaction mixture moves via channel through hot and cold zones on a microfluidic chip. Thermal cyclers designed for quantitative PCR have optical systems which enable fluorescence to be monitored during reaction cycling.

==Modern innovation==
Modern thermal cyclers are equipped with a heated lid that presses against the lids of the reaction tubes. This prevents condensation of water from the reaction mixtures on the insides of the lids. Traditionally, a layer of mineral oil was used for this purpose. Some thermal cyclers are equipped with a fully adjustable heated lid to allow for nonstandard or diverse types of PCR plasticware.

Some thermal cyclers are equipped with multiple blocks allowing several different PCRs to be carried out simultaneously. Some models also have a &quot;gradient&quot; function to allow for different temperatures in different parts of the block. This is particularly useful when testing suitable annealing temperatures for PCR primers.

<text>Japan Air Lines Flight 472 was an international flight that was hijacked by the Japanese Red Army (JRA) en route from Bombay to Tokyo on 28 September 1977.

== Incident ==
The Douglas DC-8, en route from Paris to Haneda Airport in Tokyo with 156 people on board, stopped in Bombay, India. Shortly after taking off from Bombay, five armed JRA members, led by Osamu Maruoka, hijacked the aircraft and ordered it flown to Dhaka, Bangladesh. At Dhaka, the hijackers took the passengers and crew hostage, demanding US$6 million and the release of nine imprisoned JRA members. The Chief of Air Staff of Bangladesh Air Force, AG Mahmud, negotiated with the hijackers from the control tower. Things were further complicated at the airport when on 1 October 1977 Bangladesh Air Force mutinied with the lead negotiator almost being killed. The next day (29 September), five hostages were released, including American actress Carole Wells, who was on her honeymoon with her husband, former California assemblyman Walter J. Karabian. Karabian remained on board.

On 1 October Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda announced that the Japanese government would accept the hijackers&#x27; demands, on the principle that &quot;the life of a single person outweighs the earth.&quot; Six of the imprisoned JRA members were then released.

A chartered Japan Airlines flight carried the money and the six released JRA members to Dhaka, where the exchange took place on 2 October. The hijackers released 118 passengers and crew members. On 3 October, they flew to Kuwait City and Damascus, where they released eleven more hostages. Finally, the aircraft was flown to Algeria, where it was impounded by authorities and the remaining hostages were freed.

== Aftermath ==
The incident contrasted the European and American approach of non-negotiation with terrorists to Japan&#x27;s approach of appeasing terrorists if necessary. Shortly after the incident, Japan&#x27;s National Police Agency established a Special Assault Team to deal with future acts of terrorism. Several of the JRA terrorists involved in the hijacking have yet to be apprehended and their current whereabouts are unknown.

Osamu Maruoka, who also led the hijacking of Japan Air Lines Flight 404 in 1973, escaped and remained a fugitive until 1987 when he was arrested in Tokyo after entering Japan on a forged passport. Given a life sentence, he died in prison on 29 May 2011. Another of the hijackers, Jun Nishikawa, eventually returned to Japan, was arrested, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.

<text>Tanner &#x27;88 is a political mockumentary miniseries written by Garry Trudeau and directed by Robert Altman. First broadcast by HBO during the months leading up to the 1988 U.S. presidential election, it purports to tell the behind-the-scenes story of the campaign of fictitious former Michigan U.S. Representative Jack Tanner, played by Michael Murphy, during his bid to secure the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for president of the United States.

The story is told from a number of different points of view, including Tanner, his campaign staff, the small army of news reporters that constantly follow the candidate, and volunteers. Many political figures of the time appear (some in cameos, some extended), including Bruce Babbitt, Bob Dole, Kitty Dukakis, Gary Hart, Jesse Jackson, and Pat Robertson. Trudeau and Altman revisited the story 16 years later in &quot;Tanner on Tanner&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Former U.S. Representative Jack Tanner of Michigan (Michael Murphy) is an obscure liberal Democratic politician who struggles to find a voice in the early 1988 Democratic primaries. His campaign manager, T.J. Cavanaugh (Pamela Reed), uses an unscripted, impassioned hotel-room speech caught on camera as part of an advertising campaign focusing on Tanner&#x27;s authenticity and integrity. Using the slogan &quot;For Real&quot;, Tanner emerges from a wide field of contenders to battle for the nomination against two high-profile and better-funded candidates: Jesse Jackson and eventual nominee Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis.

With Tanner are his college-aged daughter Alexandra (Cynthia Nixon), whose illness was why he earlier left politics and who has left college for the duration of the campaign, and his girlfriend Joanna Buckley (Wendy Crewson), Dukakis&#x27; deputy campaign manager. Others who appear on camera are Emile Berkoff (Jim Fyfe), a compulsive statistician with a crush on Alexandra; Deke Conners (Matt Malloy), an East Village filmmaker hired to produce Tanner campaign ads; and Andrea Spinelli (Ilana Levine), T.J.&#x27;s innocent and ditzy but well-meaning assistant. The candidate&#x27;s father, General John Tanner (E.G. Marshall), who has a contentious relationship with his son, also occasionally appears.

Although Tanner does not win the nomination, he does run a serious and credible race. The series ends on a cliffhanger after Dukakis officially becomes the Democratic candidate and Tanner considers a third party/independent run in &#x27;88.

==Episodes==
==Home media==
The miniseries was produced and first broadcast on HBO, scheduled irregularly over the real-life seven-month campaigning period from February through August 1988.

In 2004, the Sundance Channel rebroadcast the series, adding new one- to two-minute preludes created by Trudeau and Altman to each episode &quot;in which the actors reflect, in character, on the &#x27;88 campaign from the perspective of the present day&quot;. That October, Sundance produced a four episode sequel, &quot;Tanner on Tanner&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot; was added to HBO Max.

==Production==
The hybrid of fiction and reality that came to be the miniseries&#x27; trademark was initially accidental. Trudeau described the concept behind the miniseries as wanting to &quot;let the audience feel they&#x27;re eavesdropping, to create a sense of authenticity by observing the process, to follow campaign culture in all its tribal rites—not to make a topical movie about 1988.&quot; &quot;Tanner&quot; evolved during production, becoming, as Altman put it, &quot;two-thirds scripted and one-third found art&quot;. Trudeau and Altman intended to make more episodes, but HBO did not extend the run of the series.

==Reception and influence==
Reviews for the miniseries seem to improve over time. In one of the earliest reviews of the pilot episode, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the show an &quot;interesting misfire&quot; that &quot;insists too much on its own sophistication about politics&quot;. The same paper held the second episode in higher esteem, calling it &quot;humorous cinéma vérité&quot; that&#x27;s &quot;slick and occasionally witty&quot;. In its &quot;Best of 1988&quot; look at television, &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it: &quot;the year&#x27;s definitive satire of media politics&quot;.

In a 2003 review of &quot;K Street&quot;, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said &quot;&quot;Tanner&quot; skewer[s] brilliantly the insanity and inanity of presidential politics&quot;. By 2004, &quot;Slate&quot; was saying:
While the two shows are stylistically very different, Aaron Sorkin has acknowledged that &quot;Tanner&quot; had an influence on &quot;The West Wing&quot;, which he created over a decade later, in its underlying idealism and in its view of political staffers as people who at least struggle to do the right thing.

In 2004, Altman said &quot;I think it&#x27;s the most creative work I&#x27;ve ever done.&quot;

In 2019, Murphy appeared as Jack Tanner in the documentary, &quot;Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese&quot;.

==Awards==
Altman won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing in a Drama Series for the episode &quot;The Boiler Room&quot;. Reed won an ACE Award for Best Actress in a Dramatic Series.

<text>Joan Buckler Claybrook (born June 12, 1937) is an American lawyer and lobbyist who was president of Public Citizen from 1982 to 2009. She also served in the Carter administration as head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) from 1977 to 1981.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Claybrook was born and raised in Baltimore, Maryland. She attended Goucher College, graduating with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1959. In 1973, she earned a J.D. degree from Georgetown University Law Center. Between college and law school, she worked in the congressional liaison&#x27;s office at the Social Security Administration for six years before moving to Washington, D.C., in 1965 to complete a fellowship with the American Political Science Association. She also briefly worked as a staffer for Senator Walter F. Mondale.

== Career ==
In 1977, Claybrook was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to head the then 10-year-old National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Prior to her time with NHTSA, Claybrook ran Congress Watch, worked for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), the National Traffic Safety Bureau, the Social Security Administration, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. During her early years in Washington, D.C., she met Ralph Nader while advocating for improving highway and auto safety. In 1966, she lobbied with Nader for the successful passage of the nation&#x27;s first auto safety laws: the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and the Highway Safety Act. She was also involved in efforts for stricter automobile regulations. Some of these rules, such as her mandate that speedometers read no higher than 85 miles per hour, proved unpopular with U.S. car owners and were later overturned. Claybrook was also a prominent advocate for the use of airbags in automobiles.

== Board service ==
Claybrook currently serves on Georgetown University Law Center&#x27;s board of visitors. She also holds positions on the boards of Consumers Union, Citizens for Tax Justice, Public Justice, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, the Goucher College board of trustees, and the California Wellness Foundation advisory board.

<text>Polish Club (Polish: &quot;Wspólny Język&quot;, literally &quot;Common Language&quot;) is a bridge bidding system which was developed in Poland, where it is the most popular bidding system, and which is also used by players of other countries. It is a type of small club system.

In the Polish Club, a 1♣ opening bid is forcing for one round but does not necessarily show a strong hand; in most versions of this system it shows either a weak balanced hand (about 12-14HCP), a natural 1♣ opening or any strong hand. Consequently, bids of 1♦, 1♥ and 1♠ are limited to about 18HCP, and also 1♦ shows at least four diamonds (five in some versions of the system).

The 2♣ opening is usually reserved to show a limited hand with long clubs and possibly a four-card major, similar to the Precision 2♣ opening.

The following outline of the system is based on that given in &quot;System licytacyjny Wspólny Język 2005 - opis skrócony&quot; (&quot;Polish Club 2005 - a brief description&quot;) by Krzysztof Jassem. The latest version translated into English (Polish Club International, 2010), is available here:

== 1♣ opening ==
# 12–14 HCP, no 5-card major, no 4-card diamond suit. Five clubs are possible if the hand is balanced. Opener should not bid clubs on the next round – even in competition.
# 15–17 HCP, five clubs, unbalanced distribution. Opener bids clubs in the next round.
# 18+ HCP, any distribution.

===1♦ response===
# negative: 0–8 HCP. In the 7–8 HCP range, Responder should not have a 4-card major (the response of one of a major is 7+ HCP, the 1NT response is 9–11 HCP).
# 9–11 unbalanced; either both minors (5-4), or one poor minor. (The hand does not qualify for any of the responses: 1NT, 2 in a minor, 3 in a minor).
# 12–16 HCP balanced without a 4-card major. The hand is not suitable for declaring no trumps.
:1♣ - 1♦
:1♥/1♠ = better major (3 cards is possible)
:1NT = 18–19 HCP, balanced
:2♣ = 15+ HCP, natural
:2♦ = artificial GF, exclusive of 2-suiter hands
:2♥, 2♠, 3♣, 3♦ = 5+ in the bid suit, semi-forcing
:2NT = 22–24 HCP, balanced
:3♥/3♠/4♣ = GF, 2-suiter (5-5):
:3♥ – with hearts, then Responder’s 3♠ shows preference over hearts, 3NT asks for a minor, 4♣, 4♦ are cue bids with agreed hearts, 3♠ – spades and a minor, then 3NT asks for a minor, 4♣, 4♦ are cue bids, 4♣ – minors.

===1♥/1♠ responses===
7+HCP, 4+ cards, can have longer minor if less than GF

:1♣ - 1♥/1♠
:2♣ = 15+, one-round force, then Responder’s 2♦ forces to game.
:2♦ = Relay, 18+ HCP, promises at least 3 cards in Responder’s major.
:2♥ = (After 1♠ response) 5+♥, (18+ HCP), GF
:2NT = 18+ HCP, (semi-)balanced, denies 3-card support in Responder’s suit.
:After 1♣-1♥/1♠-2♦, Responder bids as follows (&quot;Bubrotka&quot;):
:2♥ = 7–10 HCP, 4 cards in the bid major
:2♠ = 11+ HCP, 4 cards in the bid major
:2NT = 11+ HCP, at least 5 cards in the bid major
:3♣, 3♦ = 9–11 HCP, 5 in the bid minor, 4 in the bid major
:3♥ = 7–10 HCP, 5 cards, unbalanced (then 3♠ asks for a shortage, 3NT asks for a side suit)
:3♠ = 7–10 HCP, 5332 with 5 in the bid major
:3NT = 7–10 HCP, 6 cards in the bid major

===1NT response===
9–11 HCP, no 4-card major

:1♣ - 1NT
:2♣ = natural, 15+ HCP, GF
:2♦, 2♥, 2♠ = 5+ cards, 18+ HCP, GF

===2♣/2♦ responses===
5+ cards, GF, can have 4-card major

===2♥/2♠ responses===
Strong jump shift (semi-solid suit)

===2NT response===
12+ HCP, GF no 4-card major

===3♣/3♦ response===
Good 6-card suit, invitational (9–11 HCP)

===3♥/3♠ responses===
7-card suit with 2 high honours, nothing outside

==1♦ opening==
4+ cards, 12–17 HCP possible canape: 4 diamonds; 5 clubs are possible if weak (12–14 HCP)

* 2♣ response – natural, promises 5 clubs, one-round force. Rebidding diamonds by Opener shows length (5 diamonds) and does not specify strength. The other 2-level bids show 4-card openings in the range of 12–14 HCP.
* 2♦ response – inverted minor, 10+ HCP, 4 diamonds
* 3♦ response – preemptive
* NT responses: 1NT = 7–10 HCP, 2NT = 11–12 HCP; both deny a 4-card major.

==1♥/1♠ openings==
5 cards, 12–17 HCP

* 1NT Response – not forcing
Responder&#x27;s 2NT is forcing after the suit is repeated.
1♥ 1♠/1NT
2♥ 2NT = forces to 3 of a major; opener shows shortage, and
1♠ 1NT
2♠ 2NT = forces to 3 of a major; opener shows shortage
Two-over-one response – forces to three of that suit.
* 2♣ response is semi-natural.
Rebidding the suit by Opener shows a minimum and does not show length.
2NT rebid by Opener shows strength (15–17 HCP).
* 2NT response – limit raise with support
* Jump raise – preemptive
Two types of Splinter bids
1♥ - 3♠ = any shortage, 9–12 HCP (then 3NT asks shortage)
1♠ - 3NT = any shortage, 9–12 HCP (then 4♣ asks shortage)
1♥ - 3NT = spade shortage, 12–16 HCP
1♥/1♠ - 4♣, 4♦, 4♥ (after 1♠) = bid shortage, 12–16 HCP
Drury-fit by a passed hand
2 of the bid major is the weakest rebid.
Jump shift by a passed hand – invitational (9–11 HCP)

==1NT opening==
15–17 HCP

*Stayman 2♣
Opener&#x27;s 2♥ does not deny four spades.
Responder&#x27;s subsequent bidding is natural: forcing at
the 3-level, non-forcing at the 2-level. Also:
1NT - 2♣; 2♦ - 2♠ = invitational (7–9 HCP), 5 spades, 4 hearts, and
1NT - 2♣; 2♥/2♠ - 3♦/3♥ = transfer, agrees Opener&#x27;s suit, GF
* Jacoby transfers 2♦/2♥
Transfer to hearts (2♦) does not deny five spades.
Responder&#x27;s new suit at the 3-level forces to game. Also:
1NT - 2♦; 2♥ - 2♠ forces to 3♥ (8+ HCP)
* 2♠ response – transfer for clubs. Opener may choose between a positive 2NT, and a negative 3♣. Responder may continue by showing shortage.
* 2NT response – limit
* 3♣ response – transfer to diamonds, weak or strong Opener is obliged to bid 3♦. Responder may continue by showing shortage.
* 3♦ – natural, inviting
* 3♥/3♠ – 5431 convention: GF, both minors: at least 5-4, shortage in the bid suit

==2♣ opening==
Precision: 5 clubs and a 4−card major, or 6 clubs, 11–14 HCP

* 2♦ response – relay, forcing to 3♣. Opener shows a 4-card suit (3♦ shows extras) or makes a choice between 2NT and 3♣ with long clubs.
* 2♥/2♠ response – not forcing, good 5-card suit (7–11 HCP)
* 2NT response – weak support in clubs or GF two-suiter. Puppet to 3♣. Opener must bid 3♣. Responder either passes or shows his suits: 3♦ = diamonds and hearts, 3♥ = hearts and spades 3♠ = spades and diamonds.
* 3♣ response – limit raise (invitational)
* 3♦/3♥/3♠ response – limit, good 6-card suit

==2♦ opening==
Weak two in a major (limited Multi), 6+ cards, 6–11 HCP.

* 2♥/2♠/3♥/3♠ response – pass or correct
* 2NT – relay, forcing to 3 of the major
Opener bids:
3♣ = good opening, 3♦ relays and 3♥ shows spades. 3♠ shows hearts.
3♦ = hearts, minimum opening
3♥ = spades, minimum opening
* 3♣ response – GF, any one-suited hand, puppet to 3♦.
* 3♦ – game-invitational with support in both majors
Opener bids 4♣ with hearts and 4♦ with spades if the invitation is accepted.
* 4♣ response – asks Opener to bids the suit below his major. Opener bid 4♦ with hearts and 4♥ with spades.
* 4♦ response – asks Opener to bids his suit.
* 4♥/4♠ response – to play

==2♥/2♠ openings==
Polish two−suiters, 6–11 HCP.

* Opening 2♥ = any 5-5 with hearts (spades possible)
** 2♠ response = pass or correct
** 2NT response – asks for another suit. With hearts and spades Opener bids 3♥. Other responses – natural
* Opening 2♠ = 5 spades and 5 of a minor

==2NT opening==
5-5 in minor, 6-11HCP.

* 3♥ asks to bid a longer minor or a longer major if minors are equal.
* 3♠ – natural, forcing

==3NT opening==
Gambling (no stopper outside)

* 4♦ asks for singleton.

==Conventions in an uncontested auction==

===Jump shift===
Strong, semi−solid suit, slam interest

===Fourth suit===
Invites to game after an initial one-over-one response. Responder may pass in the subsequent bidding but Opener may not. Fourth suit forces to game after a two-over-one response.

===Third suit===
If Opener raises the third suit, that promises four cards in the suit and denies a stopper in the unbid suit. 3NT bid by Opener shows four cards in the third suit and promises a stopper in the unbid suit.

===Forcing 2NT===
Responder&#x27;s 2NT is forcing after a two-over-one response.

===Odwrotka===
After a 1♣ opening and a response in a major, 2♦ is Odwrotka (a &quot;fit reverse&quot;), that shows an 18+ hand, a fit, and asks responder to describe his hand. Jassem recommends replacing WJ2000&#x27;s &quot;Odwrotka&quot; with the &quot;Bubrotka&quot; responses above.

===2♣ – check back===
Weak with clubs or game invitational, or game forcing Opener&#x27;s rebids:
* 2♦ = minimum opening, no 3-card support
* 2 in Responder&#x27;s suit = minimum opening, 3-card support
* 2 in the other major = nice opening, 3-card support
* 2NT = nice opening, no 3-card support
Responder&#x27;s continuations: 3♣ signs off. 2 in the bid major is non-forcing (10–12 HCP). Other bids (including 2NT) are game forcing.

===En passant===
In an uncontested auction, stoppers are shown. In competition, bidding the opponent&#x27;s suit asks for a stopper. If opponents bid two suits, bidding the higher-level suit promises stopper in the lower-level suit.

==Slam bidding==

===Roman Key Card Blackwood 1430===
5♣ = 1 or 4,
5♦ = 0 or 3,
5♥ = 2 or 5 no trump queen,
5♠ = 2 and a trump queen, etc.

===Exclusion Key Card Blackwood (1430 responses)===
After trump agreement, an unusual jump shift at the 5-level (or 4♠ when hearts are agreed) asks for key cards, exclusive of the ace of the bid suit.

===Hoyt===
The cheapest bid after key cards are shown asks for kings. The next cheapest bid shows no kings, etc.

===5NT===
Kind of Josephine; asks for the number of high honours (ace, king or queen) in trumps 6♣ = 0, 6♦ = 1, etc.

===Cue bids===
First− and second−round controls are treated as equals

===Splinter bids===
Weaker and stronger types after 1♥/1♠ openings
1♥ – 3♠ = weaker Splinter (9–12 HCP), any shortage, 3NT asks
1♥ – 3NT = regular Splinter (12–16 HCP), spade shortage
1♠ – 3NT = weaker Splinter, any shortage, 4♣ asks
1♥/1♠ – 4♣/4♦/4♥ = regular Splinters (12–16 HCP)

===AutoSplinter===
An unusual shift jump agrees bidder&#x27;s own suit only if partner has not shown any suit.

===Six in the Splinter suit===
Asks partner to bid the grand slam with a void in the splinter-suit.

===Interference after Blackwood===
DOPI. Double = 0, pass = 1, the cheapest bid = 2 keycards, etc.

==Competitive bidding==

===Over opponent’s takeout double===
* Jump shift – suit and support (fit showing jump)
* New suit – forcing at 1-level (except 1♦; see below), non-forcing at 2-level
* Redouble = 10+ HCP
Opener bids before Responder: this shows a minimum if the bid is cheaper than two in the opening bid, but shows extras otherwise.
* 1♦ response over opponent&#x27;s double – natural, not forcing
* Support bidding after partner&#x27;s 1♥/1♠ opening is doubled:
** 1NT = 7–9(10) HCP; 3-card support
** 2NT = limit raise: 4-card support
** Jump shift shows suit and support.

===Over opponent’s overcall===
* New suit is forcing at the level of 1 and 3. New suit is not forcing at the level of 2.
* Jump raise is pre-emptive.

===Support bidding after partner’s 1♥/1♠ opening is overcalled===
2NT promises good support (usually 4 cards) and forces to game. Direct cue bid is game-invitational, or game forcing with flat distribution and defensive values.

===After partner’s 1NT opening is overcalled===
* Double is negative – part score range.
* New suit is non-forcing at the two-level, but forcing at the three-level.
* Lebensohl: either GF with 4 cards in the other major or non-forcing with an unbid suit.

===After partner’s 2♦/2♥/2♠ opening is overcalled===
* New suit = pass or correct.
* Double is for penalties.

===Negative double===
Through 4♦ Negative doubles include, apart from standard agreements, forcing hands with a weak 5-card suit and – after 1♥/1♠ opening – invitational no-trump hands.

===When the second defender overcalls===
* Support double. A support double does not show extras but promises offensive values.
* After a 1♣ opening, double is two-way: either a support double or a stronger variant of the opening.

==Defensive bidding==

===No−trump hands===
* 1NT and 2NT non-jump overcalls – 15–18 HCP with a stopper. Subsequent bidding: the same as after a 1NT opening
* 1NT re-opening – 12–15 HCP. Subsequent bidding: the same as after a 1NT opening
* 2NT re-opening – 19–21 HCP Subsequent bidding: similar to after the 1NT opening
* Jump overcalls – direct: natural, pre−emptive; re−opening: constructive
* Takeout doubles and strong doubles (17+HCP). Takeout doubles promise three cards in unbid majors and two cards in unbid minors. Equal level conversion shows extras.
* After partner has doubled 1♣, a 1♦ bid is negative, other 1-level suit bids are forcing.

===After 2♦ artificial opening (Multi or Wilkosz)===
Second hand&#x27;s double is for takeout of spades. Pass and then double after 2♥/3♥ in the next round is for takeout of hearts:
:2♦ dble 2♥ dble = responsive
:2♦ dble 2♠ dble = punitive
Fourth hand&#x27;s live double is for takeout:
:2♦ pass 2♥/2♠ dble = takeout of hearts/spades respectively

===Direct cue bid===
Michaels cue bid – unlimited

===Jump cue bid===
Jump cue bid shows either a solid suit and asks for a stopper or shows any game-forcing one-suiter hand.

===Versus strong 1 NT opening===
* Double shows two suits: 5+ cards in a minor, 4+ cards in a major.
* 2♣ = major two-suiter
* 2♦ = 6+ card in one major
* 2♥/2♠ = 5 cards in the bid suit and a 4-card minor

===Versus weak 1NT opening===
Double is for takeout. Other bids show the same shape as versus
a strong no trump and promise opening values.

===Other===
* Drury (2♣) promises fit, rebidding the suit is weakest bid.
* Lebensohl after 2♥/2♠ and partner&#x27;s double

==Leads and signals==
* Leads are 2nd best from bad suits (low from two); 4th best from good suits; top of honours; ace from ace-king, king from king- -queen, etc., except 9 from 109x(x).
* Signals are upside down throughout. In partner&#x27;s led suit, count is preferred in suit contracts, attitude is preferred in no trump contracts.
* Echo against no trump contracts – a small card in declarer&#x27;s first-played suit (from either hand) accepts the lead. Lavinthal – standard way (discouraging in the suit discarded, suit preference for the other 2 suits).

<text>Richard Milton McKenna (May 9, 1913 – November 1, 1964) was an American sailor and novelist. He was best known for his historical novel &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot;, which tells the story of an American sailor serving aboard a gunboat on the Chinese Yangtze River in 1925.

==Biography==

===Early life===
McKenna was born in Mountain Home, Idaho, on May 9, 1913.

Seeking more opportunities than could be found in such a rural part of the country at the height of the Great Depression, McKenna joined the U.S. Navy in 1931 at the age of 18. He served for 22 years, including 10 years of active sea duty. He served in World War II and the Korean War.

He retired as a Chief Machinist&#x27;s Mate. Because of the benefits of the GI Bill, McKenna was able to attend college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he studied creative writing. He also married a librarian, Eva, whom he met at the college.

===Writing career===
McKenna began his writing career publishing science fiction, and starting in 1958 he regularly attended the annual Milford Writer&#x27;s Workshop for science fiction writers. &quot;He had enormous talent&quot;, writes his colleague Ben Bova in the book &quot;Notes to a Science Fiction Writer&quot;. His first science fiction story &quot;Casey Agonistes&quot; immediately established him as a writer to be watched when it appeared in the September 1958 issue of &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;. Only a handful of his science fiction tales were published during his lifetime, but after his death several more appeared posthumously.

McKenna&#x27;s major work was &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; (1962), a 597-page novel later made into the well-known 1966 film of the same title. The protagonist was an enlisted career sailor on a U.S. Navy river gunboat named the &quot;San Pablo&quot; in China during the 1920s. McKenna himself served aboard a river gunboat on the Yangtze Patrol, but about ten years after the events in his novel and of more modern construction (&quot;San Pablo&quot; was an ancient gunboat seized from the Spanish in 1898). &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; won the $10,000 1963 Harper Prize Novel and was chosen as a Book-of-the-Month Club selection.

Shortly after the movie deal was announced, McKenna appeared on the television quiz program &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, receiving one vote from the celebrity panel. 

McKenna&#x27;s posthumously published short story &quot;The Secret Place&quot; won the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1966 and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1967. &quot;Casey Agonistes and Other Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories&quot; (1973) collects the title story and four other short works: &quot;Hunter Come Home&quot;, &quot;The Secret Place&quot;, &quot;Mine Own Ways&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot;. The collections &quot;The Sons of Martha&quot; and &quot;The Left Handed Monkey Wrench&quot; were also published posthumously.

===Death===
McKenna died at his Chapel Hill N.C. home on November 4, 1964, at age 51.

<text>Elizabeth Street is one of the main streets in the Melbourne central business district, Victoria, Australia, part of the Hoddle Grid laid out in 1837. It is presumed to have been named in honour of governor Richard Bourke&#x27;s wife.

The street is known as a retail shopping precinct. It is connected with key shopping and tourist destinations such as Bourke Street Mall, General Post Office, Melbourne Central Shopping Centre, Emporium Melbourne and Queen Victoria Market.

The intersection of Elizabeth Street and Flinders street has been the site of ongoing social and criminal issues in recent times.

== Geography ==

The street runs roughly north-south in-between Queen Street and Swanston Street. At the southern end the street terminates at Flinders Street station, whilst the northern end terminates at Grattan Street, north of the Haymarket Roundabout.

Haymarket connects Elizabeth Street to Peel Street towards the south-west, Flemington Road to the north-west, Royal Parade to the north and Grattan Street to the East. This complex, high-traffic roundabout is further complicated by trams travelling through it on varying routes. Traffic lights were installed on the roundabout in 2011 to limit the dangerous complexity of the intersection, it having previously functioned as a normal roundabout.

=== Floods ===
Elizabeth Street is the lowest point in the Melbourne central business district, with land rising both to the east and west, and more gradually to the north. The street was built on top of a historic natural creek and has suffered numerous floods in Melbourne&#x27;s history.

Flash flooding south towards the Yarra River occurred in 1882, 1972 and more recently during the 2010 Victorian storms. The Elizabeth Street drain runs from Carlton in the north to the Yarra River in the south, carrying storm water from the inner northern suburbs and city centre. This drain is a significant source of pollutants entering the lower Yarra.

== Notable buildings ==

Elizabeth Street is home to many historically important buildings, modern structures and works of art. These various works are listed on both the Victorian Heritage Register and National Trust of Australia.

* Flinders Street Station
* Melbourne City Building
* General Post Office

== Motorcycle and Camera Precincts ==
Elizabeth Street has been home to a number of photography retailers and a considerable number of motorcycle dealers. The street has been the home of motorbike retailing in inner Melbourne since 1903, the longest-existing such area in the world.

== Transport ==
As well as Flinders Street station at the southern end, the western exit of Melbourne Central railway station is located at the intersection of Latrobe and Elizabeth Streets. A number of tram services run along the street, including route 19 trams to Coburg North, route 59 trams to Airport West and route 57 trams to West Maribyrnong.

<text>The Shrine of the Grotto of the Redemption is a religious shrine in West Bend, Iowa, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sioux City. A conglomeration of nine grottos depicting scenes in the life of Jesus, it contains a large collection of minerals and petrifications and is believed to be the largest grotto in the world.

It is also &quot;considered to be the world&#x27;s most complete man-made collection of minerals, fossils, shells, and petrifications in one place.&quot; The estimated value of the rocks and minerals which make up the Grotto is over $4,308,000. Over 100,000 people visit each year.

It includes a museum with precious and semiprecious stones from throughout the world, and photos and artifacts about the construction of the shrine.

==History==
Father Paul Dobberstein was a German immigrant ordained in 1897. He became critically ill with pneumonia and promised to build a shrine to the Virgin Mary if she interceded for him. After his recovery, he began stockpiling rocks and precious stones. Construction of the Grotto began in 1912 and continued year round for 42 years.

Father Dobberstein used the knowledge and skills gained during construction of his first grotto honoring Our Lady of Lourdes while training at St. Francis Seminary in St. Francis, Wisconsin. His method was to set fancy rocks and gems into concrete. In 1946, Father Louis Greving began helping Dobberstein with the construction. The Grotto covered an area the size of a city block when Dobberstein died in 1954. Matt Szerensce helped contribute the work until his retirement in 1959. The Grotto was maintained by Deacon Gerald Streit from 1994 until his retirement in the early 2000s.

Father Dobberstein&#x27;s works inspired Mathias Wernerus (who also attended St. Francis Seminary) to build the Dickeyville Grotto in Dickeyville, Wisconsin, in 1930, starting the grotto-building movement in America.

In August 1, 2015, the Grotto was raised to the status of a diocesan shrine by R. Walker Nickless, Bishop of Sioux City, becoming the diocese&#x27;s first designated religious shrine.

==In popular culture==
The Grotto of the Redemption is featured in the David Lynch film &quot;The Straight Story&quot;.

<text>Conor Patrick Casey (born July 25, 1981) is an American former soccer player. He played for 16 seasons as a forward, finishing his career with Columbus Crew SC, before turning to coaching with his former club Colorado Rapids.

==Playing career==
===Youth and college===
Casey was born in New Hampshire, but moved to Colorado at age five, and considers Denver his hometown. He played soccer at Denver&#x27;s South High School and went on to play two years of college soccer for the University of Portland from 1999 to 2000. In his first year at the University of Portland, Casey was named best player of the year. In 2000, he led the NCAA in scoring with twenty-three goals and seven assists.

===Professional===
After playing well in the 2000 Summer Olympics Casey signed a four-year contract with German club Borussia Dortmund. After finishing a year of playing with the club, Casey was loaned out in the 2001–02 season to Hannover 96, where he scored seven goals in nineteen games. The subsequent year, Casey stayed with Dortmund, but only saw action in four games, scoring one goal. In 2003–04, he was again loaned to a second division club, Karlsruher SC, scoring fourteen goals in thirty games. In 2004, Casey signed with Bundesliga club Mainz 05, but scored only two goals and struggled with injuries during two and a half seasons with the club.

After being released by Mainz, Casey returned to America and signed with Major League Soccer. Casey was originally allocated to Toronto FC and after two games with no goals and no assists, he was traded to his hometown club, Colorado Rapids, on April 19, 2007, in exchange for Riley O&#x27;Neill and an undisclosed amount of allocation money.

He played 15 games with the Rapids in 2007, scoring two goals and three assists. In 2008, he scored 11 goals and two assists in 21 games. Casey ended the 2009 MLS season, with 16 goals, just one less than leader Jeff Cunningham to go along with one assist in 24 games. He was named in the MLS Best XI in 2009. In 2010, Casey became the All Time goal scorer for the Colorado Rapids as he scored 13 goals and 6 assists in 27 games. Likewise in 2010, Casey was selected as the MVP for the 2010 MLS Cup championship though the representative of the award sponsor announced &quot;Casey Conor&quot; when awarding it. In 2011, Casey suffered a season-ending Achilles tendon injury in a July 16 game against the Seattle Sounders FC as he finished that season with six goals and one assist in 14 games. In 2012, Casey scored two goals and three assists in 18 games. On November 16, 2012, Casey was released by the Colorado Rapids.

On December 14, 2012, Casey was selected by Philadelphia Union in the first round of the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft, Stage 2. On January 23, 2015, it was announced that Casey had signed a new contract with the club for the 2015 season.

After three seasons in Philadelphia, Casey signed with Columbus Crew SC on January 26, 2016.

===International===
Casey played at the 2001 World Youth Championship in Argentina and then graduated to the senior United States national team, getting his first cap on March 31, 2004, against Poland. On July 7, 2005, Casey suffered a tear to his ACL while playing against Cuba in the U.S.&#x27;s opening game of the Gold Cup. He served as a late sub for the United States during several matches in the 2009 Confederations Cup. Casey scored twice (his first ever Senior team goals) against Honduras in a critical world cup qualifier at San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on October 10, 2009. The unanimous Man of the Match, Casey scored the U.S.&#x27;s first two goals, and was fouled to set up the game-winning free-kick goal by Landon Donovan. The win put the United States through to the 2010 World Cup.

==Managerial career==
On January 26, 2017, Casey was hired by Colorado Rapids as an assistant coach. On May 1, 2019, head coach Anthony Hudson was fired and Casey was promoted to interim head coach.

In December 2021, Casey was announced as the new head coach of the Charleston Battery in the USL Championship, becoming the sixth head coach in the club&#x27;s history. Charleston and Casey mutually agreed to part ways on October 12, 2022, before the final match of the season after a dismal year of only six wins in 33 contests.

<doc id="1107448" wikidata="Q6866528" url="?curid=1107448" title="Ministers in the New Zealand Government">
<text>Ministers () in the New Zealand Government are members of Parliament (MPs) who hold ministerial warrants from the Crown to perform certain functions of government. This includes formulating and implementing policies and advising the governor-general. Ministers collectively make up the executive branch of the New Zealand state. The governor-general is obliged to follow the advice of the prime minister on the appointment and dismissal of ministers.

Most ministers are members of Cabinet, and all ministers, including those outside Cabinet, serve concurrently as councillors of the Executive Council of New Zealand. These executives are also formally titled &quot;ministers of the Crown&quot;, as in other Commonwealth realms.

==Terminology==
&quot;Minister of the Crown&quot; () is the formal title used in Commonwealth realms to describe a minister of the reigning sovereign or governor-general. The legal term &quot;the Crown&quot; vaguely refers to both the sovereign and the state, the latter encompassing the branches of government. In New Zealand, an adviser to the sovereign or governor-general is also referred to simply as &quot;minister&quot;, but the formal title is used in the New Zealand &quot;Cabinet Manual&quot;.

== Appointment and dismissal ==
The appointment of an MP as a minister is formally made by the governor-general, who must sign a ministerial warrant before it officially comes into effect. The governor-general appoints the prime minister (head of government) on the basis of whether they are able to command the confidence of Parliament. The prime minister will advise the governor-general on the appointment or dismissal of other ministers. The first appointments are made whenever a new government takes office, and thereafter whenever a vacancy arises (due to a minister being dismissed or resigning). Each minister takes an oath (or affirmation) of office.

The recommendations that the prime minister chooses to give are theoretically their own affair, but the political party (or parties) behind them will almost certainly have views on the matter, and most recommendations are made only after negotiation and bargaining. Different parties have different mechanisms for this – the Labour Party, for example, has provision for its parliamentary caucus to select ministers, while the National Party allows the prime minister to select ministers at their discretion.

==Responsibilities and powers==
The formal powers of the executive are exercised through the Executive Council, which consists of all ministers, and is headed by the governor-general. When the Executive Council resolves to issue an order, and the order is signed by the governor-general, it becomes legally binding.

At the same time as they are appointed to the Executive Council, a minister is generally charged with supervising a particular aspect of the government&#x27;s activities, known as a &quot;&quot;, such as the provision of health services (minister of health) or the upkeep of law enforcement (minister of police). A minister with portfolio is also responsible for a corresponding public sector organisation, usually known as a department or ministry. 
A &quot;warrant&quot; from the Crown is a formal written authority that is granted by the governor-general to a minister. The warrant sets out the minister&#x27;s responsibilities, powers, and duties within their portfolio. It is essentially a legal document that gives a minister the authority to carry out their duties, and is necessary for them to be able to exercise the powers and functions of their portfolio. 

Ministers without portfolio are MPs appointed as minister without a specific role. Such appointments have become rare today, although sometimes an MP may be appointed to a sinecure portfolio such as &quot;minister of state&quot; for similar purposes.

Individual ministerial responsibility is a constitutional convention that a minister is ultimately responsible for the decisions and actions (and the consequences that follow) of individuals and organisations for which they have ministerial responsibility. Individual ministerial responsibility is not the same as cabinet collective responsibility, which states members of Cabinet must approve publicly of its collective decisions or resign.

== History ==
Originally, the Executive Council functioned as an advisory group to the governor, and ministerial functions were performed by appointed officials, not politicians. The various &quot;ministers&quot; serving on the Council, such as the Colonial Secretary (Andrew Sinclair from 1844) and the Colonial Treasurer (Alexander Shepherd from 1842), reported to the Governor. When Parliament was established, however, many believed that they would soon replace these appointed officials, with ministerial positions being given to members of Parliament instead. The Acting Governor, Robert Wynyard, did not agree, however, saying that the levers of government could not be turned over to Parliament without approval from United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The issue was controversial, and ended with the Acting Governor attempting (with only partial success) to suspend the 1st New Zealand Parliament.

Later, in the 2nd New Zealand Parliament, Parliament was victorious, and the first political ministers were appointed in the 1856 Sewell Ministry. Henry Sewell became Colonial Secretary, Dillon Bell became Colonial Treasurer, Frederick Whitaker became Attorney-General, and Henry Tancred became a minister without portfolio. Since then, all ministers have been appointed from among the ranks of Parliament.

Later, Parliament made further gains, with the convention being established that the governor-general&#x27;s actions in the Executive Council were bound by the advice that ministers gave. Today, the Executive Council is not used for deliberation—rather, Cabinet is the forum for debate. The Executive Council formally advises the governor-general on decisions already agreed by Cabinet. Individual ministers must obtain collective agreement from Cabinet to bring items to the Executive Council.

==Ranking==
The prime minister ranks the Cabinet ministers to determine seniority, or the &quot;pecking order&quot;. This ranking depends on factors such as length of service, the relative prominence of a portfolio, and &quot;personal standing with the prime minister&quot;. Lists of ministers are often ordered according to each individual minister&#x27;s ranking.

==Prominent ministerial positions==
*Prime Minister
*Deputy Prime Minister
*Minister of Agriculture
*Minister of Conservation
*Minister of Defence
*Minister of Education
*Minister of Finance
*Minister of Foreign Affairs
*Minister of Health
*Minister of Internal Affairs
*Minister of Justice

<doc id="1107462" wikidata="Q2704093" url="?curid=1107462" title="Military dictatorship of Chile">
<text>An authoritarian military dictatorship ruled Chile for seventeen years, between 11 September 1973 and 11 March 1990. The dictatorship was established after the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état backed by the United States on 11 September 1973. During this time, the country was ruled by a military junta headed by General Augusto Pinochet. The military used the breakdown of democracy and the economic crisis that took place during Allende&#x27;s presidency to justify its seizure of power. The dictatorship presented its mission as a &quot;national reconstruction&quot;. The coup was the result of multiple forces, including pressure from conservative groups, certain political parties, union strikes and other domestic unrest, as well as international factors.

The regime was characterized by the systematic suppression of political parties and the persecution of dissidents to an extent unprecedented in the history of Chile. Overall, the regime left over 3,000 dead or missing, tortured tens of thousands of prisoners, and drove an estimated 200,000 Chileans into exile. The dictatorship&#x27;s effects on Chilean political and economic life continue to be felt. Two years after its ascension, neoliberal economic reforms were implemented in sharp contrast to Allende&#x27;s leftist policies. The government was advised by the Chicago Boys, a team of free-market economists educated in the United States. Later, in 1980, the regime replaced the 1925 Constitution with a new constitution in a controversial referendum. This established a series of provisions that would eventually lead to the 1988 Chilean national plebiscite on October 5 of that year.

In that plebiscite, 55% of voters rejected the proposal of extending Pinochet&#x27;s presidency for another eight years. Consequently, democratic presidential and parliamentary elections were held the following year. The military dictatorship ended in 1990 with the election of Christian Democrat candidate Patricio Aylwin. However, the military remained out of civilian control for several years after the junta itself had lost power.

==Rise to power==
There has been a large amount of debate over the extent of US government involvement in destabilising the Allende government. Recently declassified documents show evidence of communication between the Chilean military and United States officials, suggesting covert US involvement in assisting the military&#x27;s rise to power indirectly. According to the historian Sebastián Hurtado, there isn&#x27;t documentary evidence to support that the United States Government acted actively in the coordination and execution of the September 11 coup actions by the Chilean Armed Forces, however, Richard Nixon&#x27;s interest from the beginning was that the Allende government would not be consolidated and acted actively and decisively in the campaign to destabilize his government. Some key figures in the Nixon administration, such as Henry Kissinger, used the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to mount a major destabilization campaign.

As the CIA revealed in 2000, &quot;In the 1960s and the early 1970s, as part of the US Government policy to try to influence events in Chile, the CIA undertook specific covert action projects in Chile ... to discredit Marxist-leaning political leaders, especially Dr. Salvador Allende, and to strengthen and encourage their civilian and military opponents to prevent them from assuming power&quot;. The CIA worked with right-wing Chilean politicians, military personnel, and journalists to undermine socialism in Chile. One reason for this was financial, as many US businesses had investments in Chile, and Allende&#x27;s socialist policies included the nationalization of Chile&#x27;s major industries. Another reason was the propagandized fear of the spread of communism, which was particularly important in the context of the Cold War. The rationale was that US feared that Allende would promote the spreading of Soviet influence in their &#x27;backyard&#x27;. As early as 1963, the U.S. via the CIA and U.S. multinationals such as ITT intervened in Chilean politics using a variety of tactics and millions of dollars to interfere with elections, ultimately helping plan the coup against Allende.

On 15 April 1973, workers from the El Teniente mining camp had ceased working, demanding higher wages. The strike lasted 76 days and cost the government severely in lost revenues. One of the strikers, Luis Bravo Morales, was shot dead in Rancagua city. On June 29, the Blindados No. 2 tank regiment under the command of Colonel Roberto Souper, attacked La Moneda, Chile&#x27;s presidential palace. Instigated by the neo-fascist organization Fatherland and Liberty, the armoured cavalry soldiers hoped other units would be inspired to join them. Instead, armed units led by generals Carlos Prats and Augusto Pinochet quickly put down the coup attempt. In late July, 40,000 truckers, squeezed by price controls and rising costs, tied up transportation in a nationwide strike that lasted 37 days, costing the government US$6 million a day. Two weeks before the coup, public dissatisfaction with rising prices and food shortages led to protests like the one at the Plaza de la Constitución which had been dispersed with tear gas. Allende also clashed with Chile&#x27;s largest circulation newspaper, the CIA-funded &quot;El Mercurio&quot;. The newspaper was investigated for tax evasion and its director arrested and interviewed. The Allende government found it impossible to control inflation, which grew to more than 300 percent by September, further dividing Chileans over the Allende government and its policies.

Upper- and middle-class right-wing women also played a role in the opposition against the Allende government. They co-ordinated two prominent opposition groups called &quot;El Poder Feminino&quot; (&quot;&quot;female power&quot;), and &quot;Solidaridad, Orden y Libertad&quot; (&quot;solidarity, order, and freedom&quot;&quot;). The women carried out the ‘March of the Empty Pots and Pans’ in December 1971.

On August 22, 1973, the Chamber of Deputies passed, by a vote of 81 to 47, a resolution calling for President Allende to respect the constitution. The measure failed to obtain the two-thirds majority in the Senate constitutionally required to convict the president of abuse of power, but the resolution still represented a challenge to Allende&#x27;s legitimacy. The military viewed themselves as guarantors of the constitution and elements within the armed forces considered that Allende had lost legitimacy as Chile&#x27;s leader. As a result, reacting to demand for intervention from opponents of the government, the military began planning for a military coup which would ultimately take place on September 11, 1973. Contrary to popular belief, Pinochet was not the mastermind behind the coup. It was, in fact, naval officers who first decided that military intervention was necessary to remove President Allende from power. Army generals were unsure of Pinochet&#x27;s allegiances, as he had given no prior indication of disloyalty to Allende, and thus was only informed of these plans on the evening of 8 September, just three days before the coup took place. On 11 September 1973, the military launched a coup, with troops surrounding La Moneda Palace. Allende died that day of suspected suicide.

The military installed themselves in power as a Military Government Junta, composed of the heads of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Carabineros (police). Once the Junta was in power, General Augusto Pinochet soon consolidated his control over the government. Since he was the commander-in-chief of the oldest branch of the military forces (the Army), he was made the titular head of the junta, and soon after President of Chile. Once the junta had taken over, the United States immediately recognized the new regime and helped it consolidate power.

==Dictatorship&#x27;s crimes against humanity==

===Suppression of political activity===
On September 13, the junta dissolved the Congress and outlawed or suspended all political activities in addition to suspending the 1925 constitution. All political activity was declared &quot;in recess&quot;. The Government Junta immediately banned the socialist, Marxist and other leftist parties that had constituted former President Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity coalition and began a systemic campaign of imprisonment, torture, harassment and/or murder against the perceived opposition. Eduardo Frei, Allende&#x27;s predecessor as president, initially supported the coup along with his Christian Democratic colleagues. However, they later assumed the role of a loyal opposition to the military rulers. During 1976–77, this repression even reached independent and Christian Democrat labour leaders who had supported the coup, several were exiled. Christian Democrats like Radomiro Tomic were jailed or forced into exile. Retired military personnel were named rectors of universities and they carried out vast purges of suspected left-wing sympathisers. With such strong repression, the Catholic church became the only public voice allowed within Chile. By 1974, the Commission of Peace had established a large network to provide information to numerous organisations regarding human rights abuses in Chile. As a result of this, Manuel Contreras, Director of DINA, threatened Cardinal Silva Henriquez that his safety could be at risk if the Church continued to interfere which in turn resulted in death threats and intimidation from agents of the regime.

A key provision of the new constitution of 1980 aimed at eliminating leftist factions, “outlawed the propagation of doctrines that attack the family or put forward a concept of society based on the class struggle”. Pinochet maintained strict command over the armed forces and could depend on them to help him censor the media, arrest opposition leaders and repress demonstrations. This was accompanied by a complete shutting down of civil society with curfews, prohibition of public assembly, press blackouts, draconian censorship and university purges.

===Human rights violations===


The military rule was characterized by systematic suppression of all political dissidence. Scholars later described this as a &quot;politicide&quot; (or &quot;political genocide&quot;). Steve J. Stern spoke of a politicide to describe &quot;a systematic project to destroy an entire way of doing and understanding politics and governance&quot;.

Estimates of figures for victims of state violence vary. Rudolph Rummel cited early figures of up to 30,000 people killed. However, these high estimates have not held to later scrutiny.

In 1996, human rights activists announced they had presented another 899 cases of people who had disappeared or been killed during the dictatorship, taking the total of known victims to 3,197, of whom 2,095 were reported killed and 1,102 missing. Following the return to democracy with the Concertacion government, the Rettig Commission, a multipartisan effort by the Aylwin administration to discover the truth about the human-rights violations, listed a number of torture and detention centers (such as Colonia Dignidad, the ship &quot;Esmeralda&quot; or Víctor Jara Stadium), and found that at least 3,200 people were killed or disappeared by the regime. Later, the 2004 Valech Report confirmed the figure of 3,200 deaths but reduced the estimated number of disappearances. It tells of some 28,000 arrests in which the majority of those detained were incarcerated and in a great many cases tortured. In 2011, the Chilean government officially recognized 36,948 survivors of torture and political imprisonment, as well as 3,095 people killed or disappeared at the hands of the military government.

The worst violence occurred within the first three months of the coup, with the number of suspected leftists killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; (&quot;desaparecidos&quot;) reaching several thousand. In the days immediately following the coup, the Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs informed Henry Kissinger that the National Stadium was being used to hold 5,000 prisoners. Between the day of the coup and November 1973, as many as 40,000 political prisoners were held there and as late as 1975, the CIA was still reporting that up to 3,811 were imprisoned there. 1,850 of them were killed, another 1,300 are still missing to this day. Some of the most famous cases of &quot;desaparecidos&quot; are Charles Horman, a U.S. citizen who was killed during the coup itself, Chilean songwriter Víctor Jara, and the October 1973 Caravan of Death (&quot;Caravana de la Muerte&quot;) wherein at least 70 people were killed.

Leftist guerrilla groups and their sympathizers were also hit hard during the military regime. The MIR commander, Andrés Pascal Allende, has stated that the Marxist guerrillas lost 1,500–2,000 fighters that were either killed or had simply disappeared. Among the people that were killed or had disappeared during the military regime were at least 663 MIR guerrillas. The Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front stated that 49 FPMR guerrillas were killed, and hundreds tortured.
According to the Latin American Institute on Mental Health and Human Rights, 200,000 people were affected by &quot;extreme trauma&quot;; this figure includes individuals executed, tortured, forcibly exiled, or having their immediate relatives put under detention. 316 women have reported to having been subjected to rape by soldiers and agents of the dictatorship, however the number is believed to be much larger due to the preference of many women to avoid talking about this. Twenty pregnant women have declared to have suffered abortion due to torture. In the words of Alejandra Matus detained women were doubly punished, first for being &quot;leftists&quot; and second for not conforming to their ideal of women usually being called &quot;perra&quot; (lit. &quot;bitch&quot;).
In addition to the violence experienced within Chile, many people fled from the regime, while others have been forcibly exiled, with some 30,000 Chileans being deported from the country. particularly to Argentina, however, Operation Condor, which linked South American dictatorships together against political opponents, meant that even these exiles could be subject to violence. Some 20,000–40,000 Chilean exiles were holders of passports stamped with the letter &quot;L&quot; (which stood for &quot;lista nacional&quot;), identifying them as &quot;persona non grata&quot; and had to seek permission before entering the country. According to a study in Latin American Perspectives, at least 200,000 Chileans (about 2% of Chile&#x27;s 1973 population) were forced into exile. Additionally, hundreds of thousands left the country in the wake of the economic crises that followed the military coup during the 1970s and 1980s. In 2003, an article published by the International Committee of the Fourth International claimed that &quot;Of a population of barely 11 million, more than 4,000 were executed or &#x27;disappeared&#x27;, hundreds of thousands were detained and tortured, and almost a million fled the country&quot;.

There were also internal exiles who due to a lack of resources could not escape abroad. In the 1980s a few left-wing sympathisers hid in Puerto Gala and Puerto Gaviota, Patagonian fishing communities with a reputation of lawlessness. There they were joined by delinquents who feared torture or death by the authorities.

Several scholars including Paul Zwier, Peter Winn and human rights organizations have characterized the dictatorship as a police state exhibiting &quot;repression of public liberties, the elimination of political exchange, limiting freedom of speech, abolishing the right to strike, freezing wages&quot;.

===Fake combats===
Starting in the late 1970s the regime began to use a tactic of faking combats, usually known by its Spanish name: &quot;falsos enfrentamientos&quot;. This meant that dissidents who were murdered outright had their deaths reported in media as if they had occurred in a mutual exchange of gunfire. This was done with support of journalists who &quot;reported&quot; the supposed events; in some cases, the fake combats were also staged. The faked combat tactic ameliorated criticism of the regime implicitly putting culpability on the victim. It is thought that the killing of the MIR leader Miguel Enríquez in 1974 could be an early case of a faked combat. The faked combats reinforced the dictatorship narrative on the existence of an &quot;internal war&quot; which it used to justify its existence. A particular fake combat event, lasting from September 8 to 9 1983, occurred when forces of the CNI lobbed grenades into a house, detonating the structure and killing the two men and a woman who were in the building. The agents would later state, with help from the Chilean press, that the people in the house had fired on them previously from their cars and had escaped to the house. The official story became that the three suspects had caused the explosion themselves by trying to burn and destroy incriminating evidence. Such actions had the effect of justifying the existence of heavily armed forces in Chile and the dictatorship&#x27;s conduct against such &quot;violent&quot; offenders.

==Politics and power within the dictatorship==

===Pinochet–Leigh conflict===
During the 1970s, junta members Gustavo Leigh and Augusto Pinochet clashed on several occasions, dating back from the beginning of the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état. Leigh criticized Pinochet for having joined the coup very late and then subsequently pretending to keep all power for himself. In December 1974, Leigh opposed the proposal to name Pinochet president of Chile. Leigh recalls from that moment that, &quot;Pinochet was furious: he hit the board, broke the glass, injured his hand a little and bled. Then, Merino and Mendoza told me I should sign, because if not the junta would split. I signed.&quot; Leigh&#x27;s primary concern was Pinochet&#x27;s consolidation of the legislative and executive branches of government under the new government, in particular, Pinochet&#x27;s decision to enact a plebiscite without formally alerting the other junta members. Leigh, although a fervent supporter of the regime and hater of Marxist ideology, had already taken steps to separate the executive and legislative branches. Pinochet was said to have been angered by Leigh&#x27;s continued founding of a structure to divide the executive and legislative branches, eventually leading to Pinochet consolidating his power and Leigh being removed from the regime. Leigh tried to fight his dismissal from the military and government junta but on July 24, 1978, his office was blocked by paratroopers. In accordance with legal rights established by the junta government, its members could not be dismissed without evidence of impairment, hence Pinochet and his ally junta members had declared Leigh to be unfit. Airforce General Fernando Matthei replaced Leigh as junta member.

Another dictatorship member critical of Pinochet, Arturo Yovane, was removed from his post as minister of mining in 1974 and appointed ambassador at the new Chilean embassy in Tehran.

===Civilian collaborators===
Over time the dictatorship incorporated civilians into the government. Many of the Chicago boys joined the government, and Pinochet was largely sympathetic to them. This sympathy, scholar Peter Winn explains, was indebted to the fact that the Chicago boys were technocrats and thus fitted Pinochet&#x27;s self-image of being &quot;above politics&quot;. Pinochet was impressed by their assertiveness as well as by their links to the financial world of the United States.

Another group of civilians that collaborated extensively with the regime were the Gremialists, whose movement started in 1966 in the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. The founder of the Gremialist movement, lawyer Jaime Guzmán, never assumed any official position in the military dictatorship but he remained one of the closest collaborators with Pinochet, playing an important ideological role. He participated in the design of important speeches of Pinochet and provided frequent political and doctrinal advice and consultancy. Guzmán declared to have a &quot;negative opinion&quot; of National Intelligence Directorate (DINA) director Manuel Contreras. According to him this lead him into various &quot;inconviniencies and difficulties&quot;. From its side DINA identified Guzmán as an intelligent and manipulative actor in a secret 1976 memorandum. The same document posits Guzmán manipulated Pinochet and sought ultimately to displace him from power, to lead himself a government in collaboration with Jorge Alessandri. DINA spied on Guzmán and kept watch on his everyday activities. According to Oscar Contardo Guzmán was identified as gay within a portfolio held by the DINA.

According to scholar Carlos Huneeus, the Gremialists and the Chicago Boys shared a long-term power strategy and were linked to each other in many ways.
In Chile it has been very hard for the outside world to fully understand the role that everyday civilians played in keeping Pinochet&#x27;s government afloat, partly because there has been scant research into the topic and partly because those who did help the regime from 1973 to 1990 have been unwilling to explore their own part. One of the exemptions is a Univision interview with Osvaldo Romo Mena, a civilian torturer in 1995 recounting his actions. Osvaldo Romo died while incarcerated for the murder of three political opponents. For the most part, civilian collaborators with Pinochet have not broken the code of silence held by the military of the 1970s to 1990s.

===Constitution of 1980===

Establishing a new constitution was a core issue for the dictatorship since it provided a mean of legitimization. For this purpose the junta selected notable civilians willing to join the Ortúzar Commission which redacted a preliminary draft that was subsequently reviewed by the Council of State and the Government Junta. Dissidents to the dictatorship were not represented in the commission.

Chile&#x27;s new constitution was approved in a national plebiscite held on September 11, 1980. The constitution was approved by 67% of voters under a process which has been described as &quot;highly irregular and undemocratic&quot;, and was neither free nor fair. Critics of the 1980 Constitution argue that the constitution was created not to build a democracy, but to consolidate power within the central government while limiting the amount of sovereignty allowed to the people with little political presence. The constitution came into force on March 11, 1981.

===Removal of César Mendoza===

In 1985, due to the Caso Degollados scandal (&quot;case of the slit throats&quot;), General César Mendoza resigned and was replaced by General Rodolfo Stange.

===Youth policy===
One of the first measures of the dictatorship was to set up a Secretaría Nacional de la Juventud (SNJ, National Youth Office). This was done on October 28, 1973, even before the Declaration of Principles of the junta made in March 1974. This was a way of mobilizing sympathetic elements of the civil society in support for the dictatorship. SNJ was created by advice of Jaime Guzmán, being an example of the dictatorship adopting a Gremialist thought. Some right-wing student union leaders like Andrés Allamand were skeptical to these attempts as they were moulded from above and gathered disparate figures such as Miguel Kast, Antonio Vodanovic and Jaime Guzmán. Allamand and other young right-wingers also resented the dominance of the gremialist in SNJ, considering it a closed gremialist club.

From 1975 to 1980 the SNJ arranged a series of ritualized rallies in Cerro Chacarillas reminiscent of Francoist Spain. The policy towards the sympathetic youth contrasted with the murder, surveillance and forced disappearances the dissident youth faced from the regime. Most of the documents of the SNJ were reportedly destroyed by the dictatorship in 1988.

===Women during the dictatorship===

In 1962 under the presidency of Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva, the women&#x27;s section expanded pre-existing neighbourhood &#x27;mothers&#x27; centres&#x27; (which initially helped women to purchase their own sewing machines) to help garner support for their social reforms amongst the poorer sections. By the end of the 1960s, there were 8,000 centres involving 400,000 members. Under Allende they were reorganised under the rubric National Confederation of Mothers&#x27; Centres (Confederación Nacional de Centros de Madres, COCEMA) and leadership of his wife, Hortensia Bussi, to encourage community initiatives and implement their policies directed at women.

==Opposition==
===Attacks on military personnel===

One of the first armed groups to oppose the dictatorship was the MIR, Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria. Immediately after the coup MIR-aligned elements in Neltume, southern Chile, unsuccessfully assaulted the local Carabineros station. Subsequently, MIR conducted several operations against the Pinochet government until the late 1980s. MIR assassinated the head of the Army Intelligence school, Lieutenant Roger Vergara, with machine gun fire in the late 1970s. The MIR also executed an attack on the base of the Chilean Secret Police (Central Nacional de Informaciones, CNI), as well as several attempts on the lives of carabineros officials and a judge of the Supreme Court in Chile. Throughout the beginning years of the dictatorship the MIR was low-profile, but in August 1981 the MIR successfully killed the military leader of Santiago, General Carol Urzua Ibanez. Attacks on Chilean military official increased in the early 1980s, with the MIR killing several security forces personnel on a variety of occasions through extensive use of planted bombs in police stations or machine gun use.

Representing a major shift in attitudes, the CPCh founded the FPMR on 14 December 1983, to engage in a violent armed struggle against the junta. Most notably the organisation attempted to assassinate Pinochet on the 7 September 1986 under &#x27;Operation XX Century&#x27; but were unsuccessful. The group also assassinated the author of the 1980 Constitution, Jaime Guzmán on 1 April 1991. They continued to operate throughout the 1990s, being designated as a terrorist organisation the U.S. Department of State and MI6, until supposedly ceasing to operate in 1999.

===Church opposition to human rights violations===

The Catholic Church, which at first expressed its gratitude to the armed forces for saving the country from the horrors of a &quot;Marxist dictatorship&quot; became, under the leadership of Cardinal Raúl Silva Henríquez, the most outspoken critic of the regime&#x27;s social and economic policies.

The Catholic Church was symbolically and institutionally powerful within Chile. Domestically, it was the second most powerful institution, behind Pinochet&#x27;s government. While the Church remained politically neutral, its opposition to the regime came in the form of human rights advocacy and through the social movements that it gave a platform to. It achieved this through the establishment of the Cooperative Committee for Peace in Chile (COPACHI) and Vicariate of Solidarity. COPACHI was founded by Cardinal Raul Silve Henriquez, Archbishop of Santiago, as an immediate response to the repression of the Pinochet regime. It was apolitical in a spirit of collaboration rather than conflict with the government. Pinochet developed suspicion of COPACHI, leading to its dissolution in late 1975. In response Silva founded the Vicariate in its place. Historian Hugo Fruhling&#x27;s work highlights the multifaceted nature of Vicaria. Through developments and education programs in the shantytown area of Santiago, the Vicaria had mobilised around 44,000 people to join campaigns by 1979. The Church published a newsletter called &quot;Solidarity&quot; published in Chile and abroad and supplied the public with information through radio stations. Vicaria pursued a legal strategy of defending human rights, not a political strategy to re-democratise Chile.

===Jornadas de Protesta Nacional===
The Days of National Protest (Jornadas de Protesta Nacional) were days of civil demonstrations that periodically took place in Chile in the 1980s against the military junta. They were characterized by street demonstrations in the downtown avenues of the city in the mornings, strikes during the day, and barricades and clashes in the periphery of the city throughout the night. The protests were faced with increased government repression from 1984, with the biggest and last protest summoned in July 1986. The protests changed the mentality of many Chileans, strengthening opposition organizations and movements in the 1988 plebiscite.

==Economy and free market reforms==
After the military took over the government in 1973, a period of dramatic economic changes began. The Chilean economy was still faltering in the months following the coup. As the military junta itself was not particularly skilled in remedying the persistent economic difficulties, it appointed a group of Chilean economists who had been educated in the United States at the University of Chicago. Given financial and ideological support from Pinochet, the U.S., and international financial institutions, the Chicago Boys advocated &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, free-market, neoliberal, and fiscally conservative policies, in stark contrast to the extensive nationalization and centrally planned economic programs supported by Allende. Chile was drastically transformed from an economy isolated from the rest of the world, with strong government intervention, into a liberalized, world-integrated economy, where market forces were left free to guide most of the economy&#x27;s decisions.

From an economic point of view, the era can be divided into two periods. The first, from 1975 to 1982, corresponds to the period when most of the reforms were implemented. The period ended with the international debt crisis and the collapse of the Chilean economy. At that point, unemployment was extremely high, above 20 percent, and a large proportion of the banking sector had become bankrupt. The following period was characterized by new reforms and economic recovery. Some economists argue that the recovery was due to an about-face turnaround of Pinochet&#x27;s free market policy, since he nationalized many of the same industries that were nationalized under Allende and fired the Chicago Boys from their government posts.

===1975–81===

Chile&#x27;s main industry, copper mining, remained in government hands, with the 1980 Constitution declaring them &quot;inalienable&quot;, but new mineral deposits were open to private investment. Capitalist involvement was increased, the Chilean pension system and healthcare were privatized, and Superior Education was also placed in private hands. One of the junta&#x27;s economic moves was fixing the exchange rate in the early 1980s, leading to a boom in imports and a collapse of domestic industrial production; this together with a world recession caused a serious economic crisis in 1982, where GDP plummeted by 14%, and unemployment reached 33%. At the same time, a series of massive protests were organized, trying to cause the fall of the regime, which were efficiently repressed.

===1982–83===

In 1982-1983 Chile witnessed a severe economic crisis with a surge in unemployment and a meltdown of the financial sector. 16 out of 50 financial institutions faced bankruptcy. In 1982 the two biggest banks were nationalized to prevent an even worse credit crunch. In 1983 another five banks were nationalized and two banks had to be put under government supervision. The central bank took over foreign debts. Critics ridiculed the economic policy of the Chicago Boys as &quot;Chicago way to socialism&quot;.

===1984–90===
After the economic crisis, Hernán Büchi became Minister of Finance from 1985 to 1989, introducing a return to a free market economic policy. He allowed the peso to float and reinstated restrictions on the movement of capital in and out of the country. He deleted some bank regulations and simplified and reduced the corporate tax. Chile went ahead with privatizations, including public utilities and the re-privatization of companies that had briefly returned to government control during the 1982–83 crisis. From 1984 to 1990, Chile&#x27;s gross domestic product grew by an annual average of 5.9%, the fastest on the continent. Chile developed a good export economy, including the export of fruits and vegetables to the northern hemisphere when they were out of season, and commanded high export prices.

===Evaluation===

Initially the economic reforms were internationally praised. Milton Friedman wrote in his &quot;Newsweek&quot; column on 25 January 1982 about the Miracle of Chile. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher credited Pinochet with bringing about a thriving, free-enterprise economy, while at the same time downplaying the junta&#x27;s human rights record, condemning an &quot;organised international Left who are bent on revenge&quot;.

With the economic crises of 1982 the &quot;monetarist experiment&quot; was regarded by critics a failure.

The pragmatic economic policy after the crises of 1982 is appreciated for bringing constant economic growth. It is questionable whether the radical reforms of the Chicago Boys contributed to post-1983 growth. According to Ricardo Ffrench-Davis, economist and consultant of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the 1982 crises as well as the success of the pragmatic economic policy after 1982 proves that the 1975–1981 radical economic policy of the Chicago Boys actually harmed the Chilean economy.

===Social consequences===
The economic policies espoused by the Chicago Boys and implemented by the junta initially caused several economic indicators to decline for Chile&#x27;s lower classes. Between 1970 and 1989, there were large cuts to incomes and social services. Wages decreased by 8%. Family allowances in 1989 were 28% of what they had been in 1970 and the budgets for education, health and housing had dropped by over 20% on average. The massive increases in military spending and cuts in funding to public services coincided with falling wages and steady rises in unemployment, which averaged 26% during the worldwide economic slump of 1982–85 and eventually peaked at 30%.

In 1990, the LOCE act on education initiated the dismantlement of public education. According to Communist Party of Chile member and economist Manuel Riesco Larraín:

Overall, the impact of neoliberal policies has reduced the total proportion of students in both public and private institutions in relation to the entire population, from 30 per cent in 1974 down to 25 per cent in 1990, and up only to 27 per cent today. If falling birth rates have made it possible today to attain full coverage at primary and secondary levels, the country has fallen seriously behind at tertiary level, where coverage, although now growing, is still only 32 per cent of the age group. The figure was twice as much in neighbouring Argentina and Uruguay, and even higher in developed countries—South Korea attaining a record 98 per cent coverage. Significantly, tertiary education for the upper-income fifth of the Chilean population, many of whom study in the new private universities, also reaches above 70 per cent.

The junta relied on the middle class, the oligarchy, domestic business, foreign corporations, and foreign loans to maintain itself. Under Pinochet, funding of military and internal defence spending rose 120% from 1974 to 1979. Due to the reduction in public spending, tens of thousands of employees were fired from other state-sector jobs. The oligarchy recovered most of its lost industrial and agricultural holdings, for the junta sold to private buyers most of the industries expropriated by Allende&#x27;s Popular Unity government.

Financial conglomerates became major beneficiaries of the liberalized economy and the flood of foreign bank loans. Large foreign banks reinstated the credit cycle, as the Junta saw that the basic state obligations, such as resuming payment of principal and interest installments, were honored. International lending organizations such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the Inter-American Development Bank lent vast sums anew.
Many foreign multinational corporations such as International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT), Dow Chemical, and Firestone, all expropriated by Allende, returned to Chile.

==Social policies==
=== Health ===
One of the most abrupt changes affecting sanitation in the country was in the realm of drinking water and sanitation in Chile. In 1977, all state-owned companies in this sector were merged into the National Sanitary Works Service (SENDOS), which led to a major restructuring process and gradual outsourcing of services to private companies. Consequently, there was an exponential, widespread increase in the connection to drinking water and sewerage systems, both urban and rural. While in 1974 only 35% of urban dwellings had access to sewerage services, by 1990 this coverage had reached 75%. Meanwhile, urban household access to drinking water rose from 60% to 95% in the same period. This allowed a large part of the population to have a private bathroom in their homes, thus replacing latrines in “pozos negros,” which were commonly used by lower-income households.

In 1978, the regime established the National Immunization Program, which provided a universal and free schedule of vaccinations from birth against the infectious diseases most prevalent among Chileans, aiming to minimize contagion and morbidity. The following year, the state-run health insurance was consolidated into the National Health Fund. Previously, there was a distinction between public or private employees (civil servants), who were covered by the National Medical Service for Employees (SERMENA), and workers plus the rest of the population, who were attended by the National Health Service (SNS).

=== Housing ===
With the establishment of a liberal economic policy, there was a strong defense of private property in all areas of Chilean national economic life, which also influenced public policy regarding social housing. The State considerably reduced its direct construction of houses and apartments, delegating that task to private construction companies, which built housing financed by a “housing subsidy” system for low-income families. Thus, the right to housing was acknowledged, but only if families made a minimum savings contribution beforehand in order to qualify for these state benefits. Between 1979 and 1989, the State granted 502,767 definitive social housing titles to sole owners.

In a 1987 interview, Pinochet himself stated that his intention was “to make Chile a country of property owners and not proletarians.”

The cost of housing in Chile was deregulated, leaving it to free-market criteria. Likewise, beginning in the 1980s, there was a mass relocation of residents from informal settlements in large cities, known in Chile as &quot;poblaciones callampa&quot;, moving families to designated areas. In the case of Gran Santiago, they were transferred to the city’s peripheral zones, to neighborhoods built specifically to meet their basic needs, as well as the irregular residents along the banks of the Mapocho River, who were relocated to higher and less humid areas, one of the most notable cases being Cerro 18 in Lo Barnechea.

=== Public works ===
One of the main objectives set by the military dictatorship was to increase the country’s connectivity, improving the road network for economic reasons (transport of people and goods) as well as for military logistical strategy. Its most notable project was the Carretera Austral, initially focused on rerouting the road to directly connect the cities of Chaitén and Coyhaique. The large-scale plan for the region stemmed from studies that Pinochet had conducted in 1956, when he was a professor at the Army War Academy, as mentioned in his geopolitics book.

=== Indigenous peoples ===
The land policy regarding Indigenous peoples in Chile began to be regulated under DL No. 2,568 of 1979, which introduced the possibility of individual land ownership by single titleholders—rather than collective ownership—belonging to the country’s native ethnic groups. This took place under a special scheme known as “tierra indígena,” whereby there was a restriction on transferring the property (through sale, conveyance, or exchange) for a minimum period of 25 years, while allowing inheritance by rightful indigenous heirs in the event of the owner’s death. In 1976, the Regional Council and the Communal Mapuche Councils were created for the La Araucanía Region, serving as advisory bodies to the regional intendant in Temuco.

In February 1989, the Junta General de Loncos y Caciques de Nueva Imperial, belonging to the Mapuche people, designated Augusto Pinochet as &quot;Ulmen F’ta Lonco&quot; (an honorary title meaning “Great Authority”), to express gratitude for the favorable relations they had with the Executive Branch during the dictatorship.

=== Migration policy ===
Decree Law No. 1,094 of 1975 was conceived as a key tool within the ideological framework of the National Security Doctrine. Drafted during the early years of the dictatorship, it reflected a concern about preserving &quot;internal order&quot; in the face of perceived ideological and political threats. Its primary goal was to prevent the entry of individuals considered potential &quot;agitators&quot; or &quot;subversives&quot;, who could challenge the country’s political or social system, and to expel those already present in Chile. Among its most controversial provisions, the decree granted broad powers to the Executive to ban entry, expel foreigners, and restrict rights on grounds of &quot;national interest&quot; or &quot;security&quot;. It also incorporated mechanisms that allowed authorities to act at their discretion, facilitating the expulsion of immigrants. Under this Decree Law, the Immigration and Migration Department was established, along with duties and obligations for immigrants arriving in Chile.

==Foreign relations==

Having risen to power on an anti-Marxist agenda, Pinochet found common cause with the military dictatorships of Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and later, Argentina. The six countries eventually formulated a plan known as Operation Condor, in which the security forces of participating states would target active left-wing militants, guerrilla fighters, and their alleged sympathizers in the allied countries. Pinochet&#x27;s government received tacit approval and material support from the United States. The exact nature and extent of this support is disputed. (&quot;See&quot; U.S. role in 1973 Coup, U.S. intervention in Chile and Operation Condor for more details.) It is known, however, that the American Secretary of State at the time, Henry Kissinger, practiced a policy of supporting coups in nations which the United States viewed as leaning toward Communism.

The new junta quickly broke diplomatic relations with Cuba and North Korea, which had been established under the Allende government. Shortly after the junta came to power, several communist countries, including the Soviet Union, North Vietnam, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, severed diplomatic relations with Chile however, Romania and the People&#x27;s Republic of China both continued to maintain diplomatic relations with Chile. Pinochet nurtured the relationship with China. The government broke diplomatic relations with Cambodia in January 1974 and with South Vietnam in March 1974. Pinochet attended the funeral of General Francisco Franco, dictator of Spain from 1936 to 1975, in late 1975.

In 1980, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos had invited the entire Junta (consisting at this point of Pinochet, Merino, Matthei, and Mendoza) to visit the country as part of a planned tour of Southeast Asia in an attempt to help improve their image and bolster military and economic relations with the Philippines, Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong. Due to intense U.S. pressure at the last minute (while Pinochet&#x27;s plane was halfway en route over the Pacific), Marcos cancelled the visit and denied Pinochet landing rights in the country. Pinochet and the junta were further caught off guard and humiliated when they were forced to land in Fiji to refuel for the planned return to Santiago, only to be met with airport staff who refused to assist the plane in any way (the Fijian military was called in instead), invasive and prolonged customs searches, exorbitant fuel and aviation service charges, and hundreds of angry protesters who pelted his plane with eggs and tomatoes. The usually stoic and calm Pinochet became enraged, firing his Foreign Minister Hernán Cubillos, several diplomats, and expelling the Philippine Ambassador. Relations between the two countries were restored only in 1986 when Corazon Aquino assumed the presidency of the Philippines after Marcos was ousted in a non-violent revolution, the People Power Revolution.

===Argentina===
President of Argentina Juan Perón condemned the 1973 coup as a &quot;fatality for the continent&quot; stating that Pinochet represented interests &quot;well known&quot; to him. He praised Allende for his &quot;valiant attitude&quot; and took note of the role of the United States in instigating the coup by recalling his familiarity with coup-making processes. On 14 May 1974 Perón received Pinochet at the Morón Airbase. Pinochet was heading to meet Alfredo Stroessner in Paraguay so the encounter at Argentina was technically a stopover. Pinochet and Perón are both reported to have felt uncomfortable during the meeting. Perón expressed his wishes to settle the Beagle conflict and Pinochet his concerns about Chilean exiles in Argentina near the frontier with Chile. Perón would have conceded on moving these exiles from the frontiers to eastern Argentina, but he warned &quot;Perón takes his time, but accomplishes&quot; (&quot;Perón tarda, pero cumple&quot;). Perón justified his meeting with Pinochet stating that it was important to keep good relations with Chile under all circumstances and with whoever might be in government. Perón died in July 1974 and was succeeded by his wife, Isabel Perón, who was overthrown in 1976 by the Argentine military who installed themselves as a new dictatorship in Argentina.

Chile was on the brink of being invaded by Argentina, as the Argentina junta initiated Operation Soberanía on 22 December 1978 because of the strategic Picton, Lennox and Nueva islands at the southern tip of South America on the Beagle Channel. A full-scale war was prevented only by the calling off of the operation by Argentina for military and political reasons. But the relations remained tense as Argentina invaded the Falklands (Operation Rosario). Chile along with Colombia, were the only countries in South America to criticize the use of force by Argentina in its war with the UK over the Falkland Islands. Chile actually helped the United Kingdom during the war. The two countries (Chile and Argentina) finally agreed to papal mediation over the Beagle Channel that finally ended in the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina (&quot;Tratado de Paz y Amistad&quot;). Chilean sovereignty over the islands and Argentinian east of the surrounding sea is now undisputed.

===United States===

The U.S. government had been interfering in Chilean politics since 1961, and it spent millions trying to prevent Allende from coming to power, and subsequently undermined his presidency through financing opposition. Declassified Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) documents reveal U.S. knowledge and alleged involvement in the coup. They provided material support to the military regime after the coup, although criticizing it in public. A document released by the CIA in 2000, titled &quot;CIA Activities in Chile&quot;, revealed that the CIA actively supported the military junta during and after the overthrow of Allende and that it made many of Pinochet&#x27;s officers into paid contacts of the CIA or U.S. military, even though some were known to be involved in human rights abuses.
The U.S. continued to give the &quot;junta&quot; substantial economic support between the years 1973–79, despite concerns from more liberal Congressmen, as seen from the results of the Church Committee. U.S. public stance did condemn the human rights violations, however declassified documents reveal such violations were not an obstacle for members of the Nixon and Ford administrations. Henry Kissinger visited Santiago in 1976 for the annual conference of the Organisation of American States. During his visit he privately met with Pinochet and reassured the leader of internal support from the U.S. administration.
The U.S. went beyond verbal condemnation in 1976, after the murder of Orlando Letelier in Washington D.C., when it placed an embargo on arms sales to Chile that remained in effect until the restoration of democracy in 1989. This more aggressive stance coincided with the election of Jimmy Carter who shifted the focus of U.S. foreign policy towards human rights.

The U.S. arms embargo served to kickstart the Chilean weapons industry, with the military aviation company ENAER standing out as the military manufacturer that developed the most following the embargo. On the contrary, the naval manufacturer ASMAR was the least impacted by the embargo.

===United Kingdom===
Britain&#x27;s initial reaction to the overthrowing of Allende was one of caution. The Conservative government recognised the legitimacy of the new government but didn&#x27;t offer any other declarations of support.

Under the Labour government of 1974–1979, while Britain regularly condemned the junta at the United Nations for its human rights abuses, bilateral relations between the two were not affected to the same degree. Britain formally withdrew its Santiago ambassador in 1974, however reinstated the position in 1980 under the Margaret Thatcher government.

Chile was neutral during the Falkland War, but its Westinghouse long-range radar deployed at Punta Arenas, in southern Chile, gave the British task force early warning of Argentinian air attacks, which allowed British ships and troops in the war zone to take defensive action. Margaret Thatcher said that the day the radar was taken out of service for overdue maintenance was the day Argentinian fighter-bombers bombed the troopships &quot;Sir Galahad&quot; and &quot;Sir Tristram&quot;, leaving approximately 50 dead and 150 wounded. According to Chilean Junta and former Air Force commander Fernando Matthei, Chilean support included military intelligence gathering, radar surveillance, British aircraft operating with Chilean colours and the safe return of British special forces, among other things. In April and May 1982, a squadron of mothballed RAF Hawker Hunter fighter bombers departed for Chile, arriving on 22 May and allowing the Chilean Air Force to reform the No. 9 &quot;Las Panteras Negras&quot; Squadron. A further consignment of three frontier surveillance and shipping reconnaissance Canberras left for Chile in October. Some authors suggest that Argentina might have won the war had she been allowed to employ the VIth and VIIIth Mountain Brigades, which remained guarding the Andes mountain chain. Pinochet subsequently visited Margaret Thatcher for tea on more than one occasion. Pinochet&#x27;s controversial relationship with Thatcher led Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair to mock Thatcher&#x27;s Conservatives as &quot;the party of Pinochet&quot; in 1999.

===France===

Although France received many Chilean political refugees, it also secretly collaborated with Pinochet. French journalist Marie-Monique Robin has shown how Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s government secretly collaborated with Videla&#x27;s junta in Argentina and with Pinochet&#x27;s regime in Chile.

Green deputies Noël Mamère, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet on September 10, 2003, requested a Parliamentary Commission on the &quot;role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984&quot; before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by Edouard Balladur. Apart from &quot;Le Monde&quot;, newspapers remained silent about this request. However, deputy Roland Blum, in charge of the commission, refused to hear Marie-Monique Robin, and published in December 2003 a 12 pages report qualified by Robin as the summum of bad faith. It claimed that no agreement had been signed, despite the agreement found by Robin in the &quot;Quai d&#x27;Orsay.&quot;

When then Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin traveled to Chile in February 2004, he claimed that no cooperation between France and the military regimes had occurred.

===Peru===
Reportedly one of Juan Velasco Alvarado&#x27;s main goals was to militarily reconquer the lands lost by Peru to Chile in the War of the Pacific. It is estimated that from 1970 to 1975 Peru spent up to US$2 Billion (roughly US$20 Billion in 2010&#x27;s valuation) on Soviet armament. According to various sources Velasco&#x27;s government bought between 600 and 1200 T-55 Main Battle Tanks, APCs, 60 to 90 Sukhoi 22 warplanes, 500,000 assault rifles, and even considered the purchase of the British light fleet carrier .

The enormous amount of weaponry purchased by Peru caused a meeting between former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Pinochet in 1976. Velasco&#x27;s military plan was to launch a massive sea, air, and land invasion against Chile. In 1999, Pinochet claimed that if Peru had attacked Chile during 1973 or even 1978, Peruvian forces could have penetrated deep south into Chilean territory, possibly military taking the Chilean city of Copiapó located halfway to Santiago. The Chilean Armed Forces considered launching a preventive war to defend itself. Though, Pinochet&#x27;s Chilean Air Force General Fernando Matthei opposed a preventive war and responded that &quot;I can guarantee that the Peruvians would destroy the Chilean Air Force in the first five minutes of the war&quot;. Some analysts believe the fear of attack by Chilean and US officials as largely unjustified but logical for them to experience, considering the Pinochet dictatorship had come into power with a coup against democratically elected president Salvador Allende. According to sources, the alleged invasion scheme could be seen from the Chilean&#x27;s government perspective as a plan for some kind of leftist counterattack. While acknowledging the Peruvian plans were revisionistic scholar Kalevi J. Holsti claim more important issues were behind the &quot;ideological incompatibility&quot; between the regimes of Velasco Alvarado and Pinochet and that Peru would have been concerned about Pinochet&#x27;s geopolitical views on Chile&#x27;s need of naval hegemony in the Southeastern Pacific.

===Spain===

Francoist Spain had enjoyed warm relations with Chile while Allende was in power. Pinochet admired and was very much influenced by Francisco Franco, but Franco&#x27;s successors had a cold attitude towards Pinochet as they did not want to be linked to him. When Pinochet traveled to the funeral of Francisco Franco in 1975, the President of France Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing pressured the Spanish government to refuse Pinochet to be at the crowning of Juan Carlos I of Spain by letting Spanish authorities know that Giscard would not be there if Pinochet was present. Juan Carlos I personally called Pinochet to let him know he was not welcome at his crowning.

While in Spain Pinochet is reported to have met with Stefano Delle Chiaie in order to plan the killing of Carlos Altamirano, the Secretary General of the Socialist Party of Chile.

From 1974 to 1977 General Francisco Gorigoitía Herrera, a staunch supporter of Franco, was the Chilean ambvassador to Spain.

In 1978 Spain voted in the United Nations General Assembly condemning human rights abuses in Chile.

With democracy restored in Spain and Felipe González elected prime minister in 1982, Spain took a special interest in the incipient process of the Chilean transition to democracy.

===Foreign aid===
The previous drop in foreign aid during the Allende years was immediately reversed following Pinochet&#x27;s ascension; Chile received US$322.8 million in loans and credits in the year following the coup. There was considerable international condemnation of the military regime&#x27;s human rights record, a matter that the United States expressed concern over as well after Orlando Letelier&#x27;s 1976 assassination in Washington DC.(Kennedy Amendment, later &quot;International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976&quot;).

===Cuban involvement===

After the Chilean military coup in 1973, Fidel Castro promised Chilean revolutionaries&#x27; far-reaching aid. Initially Cuban support for resistance consisted of clandestine distribution of funds to Chile, human rights campaigns at the UN to isolate the Chilean dictatorship, and efforts to undermine US-Chilean bilateral relations. Eventually Cuba&#x27;s policy changed to arming and training insurgents. Once their training was completed, Cuba helped the guerrillas return to Chile, providing false passports and false identification documents. Cuba&#x27;s official newspaper, Granma, boasted in February 1981 that the &quot;Chilean Resistance&quot; had successfully conducted more than 100 &quot;armed actions&quot; throughout Chile in 1980. By late 1980, at least 100 highly trained MIR guerrillas had reentered Chile and the MIR began building a base for future guerrilla operations in Neltume, a mountainous forest region in southern Chile. In a massive operation spearheaded by Chilean Army Para-Commandos, security forces involving some 2,000 troops, were forced to deploy in the Neltume mountains from June to November 1981, where they destroyed two MIR bases, seizing large caches of munitions and killing a number of MIR commandos. In 1986, Chilean security forces discovered 80 tons of munitions, including more than three thousand M-16 rifles and more than two million rounds of ammunition, at the tiny fishing harbor of Carrizal Bajo, smuggled ashore from Cuban fishing trawlers off the coast of Chile. The operation was overseen by Cuban naval intelligence, and also involved the Soviet Union. Cuban Special Forces had also instructed the FPMR guerrillas that ambushed Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s motorcade on 8 September 1986, killing five bodyguards and wounding 10.

==Cultural life==
Influenced by Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s work on cultural hegemony, proposing that the ruling class can maintain power by controlling cultural institutions, Pinochet clamped down on cultural dissidence. This brought Chilean cultural life into what sociologist Soledad Bianchi has called a &quot;cultural blackout&quot;. The government censored non-sympathetic individuals while taking control of mass media.

===Music scene===
The military dictatorship sought to isolate Chilean radio listeners from the outside world by changing radio frequencies to middle wavelengths. This together with the shutdown of radio stations sympathetic to the former Allende administration impacted music in Chile. The music catalog was censored with the aid of &quot;listas negras&quot; (blacklists) but little is known on how these were composed and updated. The formerly thriving Nueva canción scene suffered from the exile or imprisonment of many bands and individuals. A key musician, Víctor Jara, was tortured and killed by elements of the military. According to Eduardo Carrasco of Quilapayún in the first week after the coup, the military organized a meeting with folk musicians where they announced that the traditional instruments charango and quena were banned. The curfew imposed by the dictatorship forced the remaining Nueva Canción scene, now rebranded as &quot;Canto Nuevo&quot;, into &quot;semiclandestine peñas, while alternative groove disseminated in juvenile &quot;fiestas&quot;&quot;. A scarcity of records and the censorship imposed on part of the music catalog made a &quot;cassette culture&quot; emmerge among the affected audiences. The proliferation of pirate cassettes was enabled by tape recorders, and in some cases this activity turned commercial as evidenced by the pirate cassette brand &quot;Cumbre y Cuatro&quot;. The music of Silvio Rodríguez became first known in Chile this way. Cassettes aside, some music enthusiasts were able to supply themselves with rare or suppressed records with help of relatives in exile abroad.

The dictatorship controlled the Viña del Mar International Song Festival and used it promote sympathetic artists, in particular those that were part of the Acto de Chacarillas in 1977. 
In the first years of dictatorship Pinochet was a common guest at the festival. Pinochet&#x27;s advisor Jaime Guzmán was also spotted on occasion at the festival. Festival presenter Antonio Vodanovic publicly praised the dictator and his wife Lucia Hiriart on one occasion on behalf of &quot;the Chilean youth&quot;. Supporters of the dictatorship appropriated the song &quot;Libre&quot; of Nino Bravo, and this song was performed by Edmundo Arrocet in the first post-coup edition while Pinochet was present in the public. From 1980 onward when the festival begun to be aired internationally the regime used it to promote a favourable image of Chile abroad. For that purpose in 1980 the festival spent a big budget on bringing popular foreign artist including Miguel Bosé, Julio Iglesias and Camilo Sesto. The folk music contest of the Viña del Mar International Song Festival had become increasingly politicized during the Allende years and was suspended by organizers from the time of coup until 1980.

Elements of military distrusted Mexican music which was widespread in the rural areas of south-central Chile. There are testimonies of militaries calling Mexican music &quot;communist&quot;. Militaries dislike of Mexican music may be linked to the Allende administration&#x27;s close links with Mexico, the &quot;Mexican revolutionary discourse&quot; and the over-all low prestige of Mexican music in Chile. The dictatorship, however, didn’t suppress Mexican music as a whole but distinguished different strands, some of which were actually promoted.

Cueca and Mexican music coexisted with similar levels of popularity in the Chilean countryside in the 1970s. Being distinctly Chilean the cueca was selected by the military dictatorship as a music to be promoted. The cueca was named the national dance of Chile due to its substantial presence throughout the history of the country and announced as such through a public decree in the Official Journal (Diario Oficial) on November 6, 1979. Cueca specialist Emilio Ignacio Santana argues that the dictatorship&#x27;s appropriation and promotion of cueca harmed the genre. The dictatorship&#x27;s endorsement of the genre meant according to Santana that the rich landlord huaso became the icon of the cueca and not the rural labourer.

The 1980s saw an invasion of Argentine rock bands into Chile. These included Charly García, the Enanitos Verdes, G.I.T. and Soda Stereo among others.
Contemporary Chilean rock group Los Prisioneros complained against the ease with which Argentine Soda Stereo made appearances on Chilean TV or in Chilean magazines and the ease they could obtain musical equipment for concerts in Chile. Soda Stereo was invited to Viña del Mar International Song Festival while Los Prisioneros were ignored despite their popular status. This situation was because Los Prisioneros were censored by media under the influence of the military dictatorship. Los Prisioneros&#x27; marginalization by the media was further aggravated by their call to vote against the dictatorship on the plebiscite of 1988. 

===Theater and literature===
Experimental theatre groups from Universidad de Chile and Pontifical Catholic University of Chile were restricted by the military regime to performing only theatre classics. Some established groups like &quot;Grupo Ictus&quot; were tolerated while new formations like &quot;Grupo Aleph&quot; were repressed. This last group had its members jailed and forced into exile after performing a parody on the 1973 Chilean coup d&#x27;état. In the 1980s a grassroots street theatre movement emerged.

The dictatorship promoted the figure of Nobel laureate Gabriela Mistral who was presented as a symbol of &quot;summission to the authority&quot; and &quot;social order&quot;. 
==Plebiscite and the return to democracy==
===1988 plebiscite===
Following the approval of the 1980 Constitution, a plebiscite was scheduled for October 5, 1988, to vote on a new eight-year presidential term for Pinochet.

The Constitution, which took effect on 11 March 1981, established a &quot;transition period,&quot; during which Pinochet would continue to exercise executive power and the junta&#x27;s legislative power, for the next eight years. Before that period ended, a candidate for president was to be proposed by the Commanders-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate then was to be ratified by registered voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.

The Constitutional Court of Chile ruled that the plebiscite should be carried out as stipulated by Article 64 in the Constitution. That included a programming slot in television (&quot;franja electoral&quot;) during which all positions, in this case, two, &quot;Sí&quot; (yes), and &quot;No&quot;, would have two free slots of equal and uninterrupted TV time, simultaneously broadcast by all TV channels, with no political advertising outside those spots. The allotment was scheduled in two off-prime time slots: one before the afternoon news and the other before the late-night news, from 22:45 to 23:15 each night (the evening news was from 20:30 to 21:30, and primetime from 21:30 to 22:30). The opposition &quot;No&quot; campaign, headed by Ricardo Lagos, produced colorful, upbeat programs, telling the Chilean people to vote against the extension of the presidential term. Lagos, in a TV interview, pointed his index finger towards the camera and directly called on Pinochet to account for all the &quot;disappeared&quot; persons. The &quot;Sí&quot; campaign did not argue for the advantages of extension, but was instead negative, claiming that voting &quot;no&quot; was equivalent to voting for a return to the chaos of the UP government.

Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros provided advice to the &quot;No&quot; campaign, according to Máximo Pacheco Matte. The support was reflected &quot;in carrying out studies and obtaining data that gave us information that had been hidden from us for 17 years (...) What we learned there was crucial for the preparation of the famous television program for the &#x27;No&#x27; campaign and for the victory in the plebiscite.&quot;

Likewise, the organization created by the United States Congress, &quot;National Endowment for Democracy&quot; and linked to the CIA together with the &quot;National Democratic Institute for International Affairs&quot; contributed one million dollars to the &quot;No&quot; campaign and sent observers to the plebiscite and established a parallel counting system in conjunction with German think tanks and the &quot;Committee for Free Elections&quot;. Furthermore, David Altman notes that Pinochet allowed &quot;a certain degree of freedom to carry out a mobilization campaign against the regime.&quot;

Pinochet lost the 1988 referendum, where 56% of the votes rejected the extension of the presidential term, against 44% for &quot;Sí&quot;, and, following the constitutional provisions, he stayed as president for one more year. The presidential election was held in December 1989, at the same time as congressional elections that were due to take place. Pinochet left the presidency on March 11, 1990, and transferred power to his political opponent Patricio Aylwin, the new democratically elected president. Due to the same transitional provisions of the constitution, Pinochet remained as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, until March 1998.

===1989 general elections===
From the 1989 elections onwards, the military had officially left the political sphere in Chile. Pinochet did not endorse any candidate publicly. Former Pinochet economic minister Hernán Büchi ran for president as the candidate of the two right-wing parties RN and UDI. He had little political experience and was relatively young and credited with Chile&#x27;s good economic performance in the second half of the 1980s. The right-wing parties faced several problems in the elections: there was considerable infighting between RN and UDI, Büchi had only very reluctantly accepted to run for president and right-wing politicians struggled to define their position towards the Pinochet regime. In addition to this right-wing populist Francisco Javier Errázuriz Talavera ran independently for president and made several election promises Büchi could not match.

The centre-left coalition Concertación was more united and coherent. Its candidate Patricio Aylwin, a Christian Democrat, behaved as if he had won and refused a second television debate with Büchi. Büchi attacked Aylwin on a remark he had made concerning that inflation rate of 20% was not much and he also accused Aylwin of making secret agreements with the Communist Party of Chile, a party that was not part of Concertación. Aylwin spoke with authority about the need to clarify human rights violations but did not confront the dictatorship for it; in contrast, Büchi, as a former regime minister, lacked any credibility when dealing with human right violations.

Büchi and Errázuriz lost to Patricio Aylwin in the election. The electoral system meant that the largely Pinochet-sympathetic right was overrepresented in parliament in such a way that it could block any reform to the constitution. This over-representation was crucial for UDI in obtaining places in parliament and securing its political future. The far-left and the far-right performed poorly in the election.

===Presidential election results===

==Legacy==
Following the restoration of Chilean democracy and the successive administrations that followed Pinochet, the Chilean economy has increasingly prospered. Unemployment stood at 7% as of 2007, with poverty estimated at 18.2% for the same year, both relatively low for the region. However, in 2019 the Chilean government faced public scrutiny for its economic policies. In particular, for the long-term effects of Pinochet&#x27;s neoliberal policies. Mass protests broke out throughout Santiago, due to increasing prices of the metro ticket. For many Chileans this highlighted the disproportionate distribution of wealth amongst Chile.

The &quot;Chilean Variation&quot; has been seen as a potential model for nations that fail to achieve significant economic growth. The latest is Russia, for whom David Christian warned in 1991 that &quot;dictatorial government presiding over a transition to capitalism seems one of the more plausible scenarios, even if it does so at a high cost in human rights violations&quot;.

A survey published by pollster CERC on the eve of the 40th anniversary commemorations of the coup gave some idea of how Chileans perceived the dictatorship. According to the poll, 55% of Chileans regarded the 17 years of dictatorship as either bad or very bad, while 9% said they were good or very good. In 2013, the newspaper El Mercurio asked Chileans if the state had done enough to compensate victims of the dictatorship for the atrocities they suffered; 30% said yes, 36% said no, and the rest were undecided. In order to keep the memories of the victims and the disappeared alive, memorial sites have been constructed throughout Chile, as a symbol of the country&#x27;s past. Some notable examples include Villa Grimaldi, Londres 38, Paine Memorial and the Museum of Memory and Human Rights. These memorials were built by family members of the victims, the government and ex-prisoners of the dictatorship. These have become popular tourist destinations and have provided a visual narrative of the atrocities of the dictatorship. These memorials have aided in Chile&#x27;s reconciliation process, however, there is still debate amongst Chile as to whether these memorials do enough to bring the country together.

The relative economic success of the Pinochet dictatorship has brought about some political support for the former dictatorship. In 1998, then-Brazilian congressman and retired military officer Jair Bolsonaro praised Pinochet, saying his regime &quot;should have killed more people&quot;.

Every year on the anniversary of the coup protests can be seen throughout the country.

The indictment and arrest of Pinochet occurred on 10 October 1998 in London. He returned to Chile in March 2000 but was not charged with the crimes against him. On his 91st birthday on 25 November 2006, in a public statement to supporters, Pinochet for the first time claimed to accept &quot;political responsibility&quot; for what happened in Chile under his regime, though he still defended the 1973 coup against Salvador Allende. In a statement read by his wife Lucia Hiriart, he said, &quot;Today, near the end of my days, I want to say that I harbour no rancour against anybody, that I love my fatherland above all. ... I take political responsibility for everything that was done&quot;.

<text>The Brunswick Progress Association is a community organisation active in the City of Merri-bek Council area, and in particular the suburbs of Brunswick and Coburg, inner northern suburbs of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. It was first established in 1905 and celebrated its centenary of community activism in 2005.

==History==
The movement to form a Town Association (Progress) began early in 1905 in reaction to the non-responsiveness of the Brunswick Council to the concerns of residents. It was the first such body established in the Melbourne metropolitan area. It is likely the Brunswick Progress Association was the second one established in Australia, as a progress association was established at Ballarat in 1904.

Australian Labor Party State Member of Parliament, and later Federal member for the seat of Bourke, Frank Anstey (1865-1940), was elected on the first Executive Committee of the Brunswick Town Association (Progress). Anstey had a long association with the organisation until his death in 1940. Maurice Blackburn succeeded Frank Anstey as Federal representative for the seat of Bourke and also maintained an active interest in the affairs of the Brunswick Progress Association.

In the cold war atmosphere of 1953 the Brunswick Council passed a resolution not to enter into any correspondence with any person who is a communist or communist sympathiser. In council elections in 1954 the Mayor and several councillors were defeated and in a meeting of Council the &#x27;Anti-red law&#x27; was rescinded 18 votes to 4.

In 1965 the Progress Association was at a low ebb of activity. Two new members, Vic Little and Vida Little, enlivened the organisation, which steadily grew in members as campaigns were launched on local issues and concerns of residents.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the Association was very active in opposition to the proposed F2 Freeway along the Merri Creek, ran a successful campaign for clean air, as Brunswick was then said to be the second most polluted city in Victoria. The clean air campaign in the 1960s was instrumental in establishing the Victorian Environment Protection Authority in 1972.

In 1971 the Brunswick Progress Association combined with the West Brunswick Progress Association to object significantly to council plans to demolish the Mechanics&#x27; Institute, which was built in 1868. The National Trust also objected and the Mechanics&#x27; Institute was saved from the wreckers.

In 1973, the Association was active in opposing council plans to demolish the Brunswick Town Hall on Sydney Road and replace it with a five story Civic Centre, costing in excess of $2 million. The Council plans were stopped with a poll of residents resulting in a no vote won by seven to one.

In 1975 the Brunswick Progress Association instituted a campaign to get a Community Health Centre complex, the Brunswick City Council opposed it, the Centre was won with wide support from the community. The Merri-bek Community Health Service is now a multimillion-dollar community organisation servicing the health needs of the residents of the City of Merri-bek, with major centres on Glenlyon Road in Brunswick, and Bell street in Coburg.

Other campaigns included:

* the condition of Sydney Road
* Nicholson Street tram route extension
* the fight for half rates for pensioners throughout Victoria
* the fight to put the Richmond-Brunswick Power line underground
* the struggle to keep the Upfield railway line open
* campaigns against many factories working at night affecting residents sleep
* support for Friends of the ABC 
* opposition to uranium mining in Jabiluka in the Northern Territory
* support for public housing, public transport
* support for Aboriginal land rights 
* opposition to privatisation of public utilities 
* support for tax reform and opposition to the Goods and Services Tax

The Association met at the now-demolished Clarrie Wohlers Citizens&#x27; Centre, Fleming Park, on the corner of Albert and Cross Streets, East Brunswick.

<text>A river gunboat is a type of gunboat adapted for river operations. River gunboats required shallow draft for river navigation. They would be armed with relatively small caliber cannons, or a mix of cannons and machine guns. If they carried more than one cannon, one might be a howitzer, for shore bombardment. They were usually not armoured. The fictional USS &quot;San Pablo&quot; described in Richard McKenna&#x27;s &quot;The Sand Pebbles&quot; is an example of this class of vessel, serving on the US Navy&#x27;s Yangtze Patrol. Stronger river warships with larger guns were river monitors.

== Chinese river gunboats ==

Various European powers, the USA, and Japan, maintained flotillas of these shallow draft gunboats patrolling Chinese rivers. These gunboats were enforcing those nations&#x27; treaty rights under the treaties that China had started to sign following her defeat during the first Opium War with Britain. The advantages of steam power and shallow drafts meant that the new European vessels initially vastly outclassed anything available to the Chinese.

Foreign powers had received concessions from China, like extraterritoriality for their citizens in China, and the gunboats policed these rights.

=== British ===

Royal Navy (RN) gunboats, numbering on average 15 a year in Chinese waters, served as &quot;station ships&quot;, assigned to specific ports, and were designed for river functions. The RN maintained patrols and escorts up and down the Yangtze based in Shanghai until the end of the International Concessions in 1941. These boats were part of the Navy&#x27;s China Station and vessels of various classes were deployed and often moved to and from other major world rivers. The Navy had built a large number of gunboats for the Crimean war in the 1850s and several of these found their way to the China Station afterwards. As these boats were scrapped, they were replaced by a new type of boat which was purpose built for inshore and river service around the world, the &quot;Beacon&quot;- and later &quot;Frolic&quot;-class boats.

The purpose built river vessels of the Insect and &quot;Fly&quot; classes which had seen service in the Mesopotamian Campaign in the Middle East and on the Danube during the First World War were deployed to China during the interbellum and took part in events of the period of the Japanese invasion of China and the beginning of the Pacific theatre of the Second World War. &quot;Ladybird&quot; and &quot;Bee&quot; were involved in the USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident. The Insects were supplemented in 1937 by the &quot;Dragonfly&quot;-class boats, three of which, &quot;Dragonfly&quot;, &quot;Grasshopper&quot; and &quot;Scorpion &quot;were involved in the fighting down the Malay Peninsula and Singapore.

=== United States ===
U.S. Navy craft were of varying age, design, size, and utility. The earliest craft made brief excursions upriver between 1861 and 1901 but were rarely assigned on permanent patrol. In 1901 two large gunboats, USS &quot;Helena&quot; (1290 tons and crew of 170) and &quot;Wilmington&quot; (1570 tons and 212), were assigned to the Asiatic Squadron&#x27;s &quot;Second Division&quot; as permanent river patrol, although too large to patrol deep inland, until 1932 and 1923 respectively. In 1903 converted gunboats of the Spanish Navy captured in 1898, began patrols designed to take them further upriver toward Chongqing. USS &quot;Elcano&quot;, a 620-ton craft with a crew of 103, and USS &quot;Villalobos&quot;, a 350-ton ship with 50 men, served until 1928, when they were decommissioned and sunk. USS &quot;Callao&quot; (240 tons) and &quot;Quiros&quot; (sister ship to &quot;Villalobos&quot;) served until 1916 and 1923.

In 1914 two 204-ton, 50-man patrol craft of British design and built at Mare Island Naval Shipyard were disassembled, shipped to China, and reassembled in Shanghai. USS &quot;Palos&quot; patrolled until 1934, when she became the station boat at Chongqing, and &quot;Monocacy&quot; until 1939. The Yangtze Patrol was formally established in 1922 as a component of the Asiatic Fleet. Six new craft were designed and built in 1928 in Shanghai, of three differing sizes. USS &quot;Guam&quot; and &quot;Tutuilla&quot;, 380 tons and a crew of 60, were able to ply the entire river year-round. USS &quot;Panay&quot; and &quot;Oahu&quot;, 450 tons and a complement of 65; and &quot;Luzon&quot;, 560 tons and 82 men, were &quot;May–September&quot; gunboats, able to patrol completely upriver only during high water months. (&quot;Luzon&quot;″s sister ship, USS &quot;Mindanao&quot; served on the China coast but not in the river patrol.) Except for &quot;Panay&quot;, sunk by Japanese aircraft in December 1937, the newer ships served in China until late 1941.

<doc id="1107495" wikidata="Q332632" url="?curid=1107495" title="Eduardo De Filippo">
<text>Eduardo De Filippo  (; 26 May 1900 – 31 October 1984), also known simply as &quot;Eduardo&quot;, was an Italian actor, director, screenwriter and playwright, best known for his Neapolitan works &quot;Filumena Marturano&quot; and &quot;Napoli Milionaria&quot;. Considered one of the most important Italian artists of the 20th century, De Filippo was the author of many theatrical dramas staged and directed by himself first and later awarded and played outside Italy. For his artistic merits and contributions to Italian culture, he was named &quot;senatore a vita&quot; by the President of the Italian Republic Sandro Pertini.

== Biography ==
=== Family ===
De Filippo was born in Naples on 26 May 1900. For many years, his birth date was mistakenly thought to be May 24th, but recent research in anagraphic books proved 26 to be the right date. Eduardo was the second son of playwright and actor Eduardo Scarpetta, the king of Neapolitan theatre, and theatre seamstress and costumier Luisa De Filippo. He and his siblings Annunziata &quot;Titina&quot; and Giuseppe &quot;Peppino&quot; were extramarital because Scarpetta was actually married since 1876 to Rosa De Filippo, Luisa&#x27;s paternal aunt. Scarpetta had six more illegitimate children from various affairs, including actors Ernesto Murolo and Eduardo Passarelli. Scarpetta never acknowledged Eduardo De Filippo and his siblings, which is why the son took his mother&#x27;s name.

=== Theatre ===
Eduardo De Filippo first appeared on stage at the age of four. Being 14, he became a professional actor in Scarpetta&#x27;s company and played there until 1927. In 1925, the company played in Milan&#x27;s Teatro Fossati where Eduardo di Filippo was spotted and then praised in a review by Renato Simoni, then the most influential critic of Italy.

In 1931, Eduardo formed a theatre company with his brother playwright Peppino and sister Titina, called &quot;Compagnia del Teatro Umoristico I De Filippo&quot;. They invented a new genre and a unique artistic approach, rooted in commedia dell’arte but not prone to its limitations. In 1931–32 the company toured Italy, then they returned to Naples and staged for Teatro Nuovo such plays as &quot;Farmacia di turno&quot; (&quot;The On-Duty Farmacy&quot;), &quot;Tutti insieme canteremo&quot; (&quot;We’ll All Sing Together&quot;), &quot;Miseria Bella&quot; (&quot;Splendid Poverty&quot;). On 24 December 1931, they performed a one-act play &quot;Natale in casa Cupiello&quot; (&quot;Christmas at the Cupiello&#x27;s&quot;) and it has such success that the engagement was extended for 6 months instead of one week. Soon they moved to Sannazzaro and staged there &quot;Chi è cchiu&#x27; felice &#x27;e me&quot; (&quot;Who&#x27;s Happier than Me?&quot;), &quot;Amore e balestre&quot; (&quot;Slings and Loves&quot;). Soon Pirandello give Eduardo the right to adapt &quot;Liolà&quot;, the play with Peppino in the title role had great success. It was followed by several other plays, gradually &quot;Compagnia del Teatro Umoristico I De Filippo&quot; grew into one of the most influential theatre companies in the country and was acknowledged as the one that made a revolution in Italian theatre. The protagonists of Eduardo&#x27;s plays were usually misfortuned, traumatized, and scorned by the closest relatives and friends, but remained full of virtue and human dignity. The pain of the heroes was always taken from life itself and that is why Eduardo&#x27;s plays resonated with the audience.

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, raising sympathies for Fascism in society made the company’s work much harder: their performances were often interrupted and the brothers received multiple threats. In 1936, 1938, and 1941 Eduardo&#x27;s antifascist stance was officially condemned by the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1937, he refused to participate in &quot;Sabato teatrale&quot; (Theatre Saturday). In 1944, Eduardo and Peppino were included in the list of people to be exiled from Rome to the North.

Peppino left the troupe in 1944 due to artistic differences, so in 1945 Eduardo and Titina created &quot;Teatro di Eduardo&quot;. They debuted in Naples in Teatro San Carlo on 25 March 1945. However, Titina left the company in the early 1950s. After the war, in 1948 Eduardo bought the S. Ferdinando theatre in Naples, inaugurated in 1954. However, in 1954 Titina was forced to leave the company and the theatre due to health problems.

In 1962, the company toured in Russia, Poland, Hungary, Austria, and Belgium. 

In 1967, he presented &quot;Il Contratto&quot; at the 26th Theatre Festival in Venezia. Also in 1967, his son Luca started playing in his father&#x27;s company, first under the pseudonym Luca della Porta.

In the 1970s, De Filippo came to London: in 1972 he brought &quot;Naples Millionaire&quot;. In 1973, Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s production of De Filippo&#x27;s 1959 play &quot;Sabato, domenica e lunedi&quot; (translated as &quot;Saturday, Sunday, Monday&quot;), starring Joan Plowright, Frank Finlay, and Laurence Olivier, was presented at London&#x27;s National Theatre and won the London drama critics&#x27; award.

On 18 December 1972, he was honoured with the Antonio Feltrinelli Award for his lifelong contribution to theatrical arts. De Filippo was praised for his poetic approach and unique way of showing drama through comedy; for breaking the limits of a dialect and opening Neapolitan culture to the world.

In January 1980, after several years of struggle, he finally opened his drama school in Florence.

In 1981, for ‘highest achievements in the arts of theatre and literature’, he was named &quot;senatore a vita&quot; by the President of the Italian Republic Sandro Pertini. In the same year, he was appointed to lead the 1981–82 course of Literature at the L’Istituto di Teatro in Rome.

=== Cinema ===
De Filippo first role in cinema was in Mario Bonnard&#x27;s &quot;Tre uomini in frak&quot;.

In 1950, De Filippo filmed &quot;Napoli milionaria&quot; (&quot;Side Street Story&quot;), based on his 1945 play. He also starred in De Sica&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;oro di Napoli&quot; with Totò and Sophia Loren in 1954. In 1964, Vittorio De Sica made &quot;Matrimonio all’Italiana&quot; (&quot;Marriage Italian Style&quot;) based on De Filippo&#x27;s play &quot;Filumena Marturano&quot;, where Filumena was portrayed by Sophia Loren.

In 1979, Laurence Olivier filmed &quot;Filumena&quot; with Frank Finlay and Joan Plowright in the lead roles.

De Filippo was the one to discover the talent of Marina Confalone, in his theatre company she thrived into one of the best Italian actresses of her time.

=== Personal life ===
He was married three times. His first wife was Dorothy Pennington, they married in 1928 and separated after a few months. In 1954 he married the actress Thea Prandi, with whom De Filippo already had two children: Luisa &quot;Luisella&quot; and Luca. Luisella played in her father&#x27;s theatre and showed remarkable talent. The couple separated in 1959. In early 1960, on Christmas holidays Luisella, stayed with her mother and brother at the Savoia-Belvedere hotel near Rome. On 5 January 1960, she suddenly lost consciousness while playing and died suddenly from a cerebral haemorrhage. De Filippo was at the rehearsal when he got the news, he never fully recovered. Luisella was buried at Verano cemetery. Thea Prandi died in 1961 from a tumour. In 1963 he lost Titina, she died from a long illness.

On 4 February 1977, he married writer and playwright Isabella Quarantotti. The actress Angelica Ippolito is his step-daughter, born to Isabella Quarantotti and her first husband, the scientist Felice Ippolito.

In 1979, Peppino died. Eduardo De Filippo died of kidney failure on 31 October 1984, in Rome, at the age of 84. His artistic legacy was inherited by his son Luca.

<text>A squamish (also known as an Arctic outflow wind in winter months) is a strong and often violent wind occurring in many of the fjords, inlets and valleys of British Columbia. Squamishes occur in those fjords oriented in a northeast–southwest or east–west direction where cold polar air can be funneled westward, the opposite of how the wind generally flows on the Coast. These winds in winter can create high windchills by coastal standards of . They are notable in Jervis, Toba, and Bute Inlets and in Dean Channel and the Portland Canal. Squamishes lose their strength when free of the confining fjords and are not noticeable more than 25 km offshore.

In Northern Washington including Lynden and Bellingham, and Lower Mainland, including Eastern Vancouver Island, of British Columbia, they are mainly referred to as outflow winds, they are noticeable especially in the winter, when a cold Arctic air mass holding in the high plateau country of the interior flows down to the sea through the canyons and lower passes piercing the Coast Mountains and crossing the Strait of Georgia. The winds are named after the Squamish People (Skwxwú7mesh) of Squamish, British Columbia.Their historical territory of upper Howe Sound, just off the Squamish River estuary, is known widely in the windsurfing and kiteboarding worlds for its excellent, steady winds.

During the Christmas season of 1996, a major blizzard which brought record snowfalls to the Lower Mainland and Eastern Vancouver Island was followed up by hurricane-force winds pouring west through the towns of the Fraser Valley, as the coastal system&#x27;s strength – which had brought the snow – was forced back by the breaking of the interior&#x27;s cold air mass. Intense outflow winds are relatively common year-round (during stormy weather, and sometimes fair) in the Upper Fraser Valley, particularly on Sumas Prairie between Abbotsford and Chilliwack, and farther upriver towards the mouth of the Fraser Canyon. Known by different names in each region up the Coast, outflow winds or squamishes are also major maritime threats off the openings of the major fjords and up their narrow, deep lengths. Queen Charlotte Strait in particular is known for heavy winds coming out of the mouth of Knight Inlet, at the upper east end of the strait.

<text>ABC NewsRadio, since 2017 broadcast under the ABC News brand and for a short time known as ABC News on Radio, is a 24-hour news radio service broadcast by the Australian public broadcaster, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). ABC NewsRadio is available via a number of platforms around Australia, including AM/FM radio, online via web or the ABC Listen app, DAB+ radio, free-to-air digital TV, and some pay-TV platforms.

The origins of the radio station lie in the statutory obligation of the ABC to live-broadcast all Australian Parliamentary sessions, which were originally (from 1946) broadcast on its national radio network. In 1988, the Parliamentary Broadcasting Network (PBN) was established as a dedicated parliamentary radio station; in August 1994 this station&#x27;s frequencies were used to provide news broadcasting when Parliament was not in session, and Parliamentary and News Network (PNN), the forerunner of ABC NewsRadio, was born.

== History ==

===Background===
Legislation passed in 1946 (the &quot;Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946&quot;) requiring the ABC to broadcast Parliament live when in session. The legislation does not determine the name of the network. Parliamentary broadcasting was commenced under Ben Chifley&#x27;s government on 10 July 1946, of Question Time. The broadcasts were put onto the single nationally broadcast radio network; however, the Commission frequently commented on the disruption this caused to its programming in its annual reports.

===1988: PBN===
In August 1988, the Parliamentary Broadcast Network (PBN) was established under the National Metropolitan Radio Plan, as a dedicated network to carry the ABC&#x27;s mandatory Parliamentary broadcasts on AM transmitters in each state capital as well as Newcastle and Canberra.

===1994: PNN===
In May 1994 the Interim Report of the Inquiry into the Radio and Television Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings was published, supporting the ABC&#x27;s proposal to provide news on the PBN. The expanded service would be called the Parliamentary and News Network (PNN). 

On 15 August 1994 PNN was launched to provide a continuous news network broadcast on the same frequencies used by the PBN, when Parliament was not sitting, with the service expanding the service to Darwin, Northern Territory in March 1997 to complete its coverage to all capital cities. in the 1996–7 financial year, &quot;ABC NewsRadio on the Parliamentary and News Network&quot; showed the strongest growth of any ABC network, increasing its weekly reach to 397,000 listeners nationally, up 44.9%. (The news service was known for some time as ABC NewsRadio on the Parliamentary and News Network, with the last six words from in parentheses for a few years before being dropped completely in 2010.)

Despite the use of the network by ABC NewsRadio, the PNN exists independent of it. The PNN falls under the &quot;Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act&quot; 1946. Parliamentary proceedings must be broadcast on the network defined by the Act.

===21st century: other platforms===
From September 2001, the 24-hour rolling news format began with live audio streaming on the Internet.

ABC NewsRadio began to continue its news programming online while its radio network broadcast parliament in 2002. The service also expanded into the Gold Coast – the first new coverage area for the network in five years.

From 2009, the service was extended to digital radio, first in the capital cities and then rolled out to regional Australia. and subscription TV services. FM transmission was expanded greatly during a 2006-2009 program. It planned to increase the AM/FM coverage from 78% of the population to 95%. In 2009, separate standard and parliamentary feeds were launched on digital terrestrial (DAB+) radio in the state capitals.

In November 2016, the ABC announced that ABC NewsRadio and ABC News 24 rebranded as ABC News on 10 April 2017. The ABC announced on that day that ABC News 24 and ABC NewsRadio were both called ABC NEWS, with a new logo and visual branding. They would be distinguished by context or by descriptors, such as &quot;the ABC News channel&quot; for TV and &quot;ABC News on radio&quot; for radio. Social media accounts would be merged.

==Content and format==
ABC NewsRadio broadcasts every session live from the House of Representatives and the Senate, and a delayed broadcast of parliamentary question time in the evening, on the AM/FM radio network, and is not streamed online or broadcast on digital radio.

ABC NewsRadio has a 24-hour news format, drawing from all of the ABC News resources, and broadcasts live across Australia, with no delayed broadcasting to accommodate Australian time zones. Schedules may change if there is breaking news. Live parliamentary coverage takes precedence over the station&#x27;s regular schedule, but while this coverage takes place (whenever Parliament is in session), regular news programming continues online, via digital radio (DAB+) in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. and on the ABC Listen app.

The station often relays programming from the BBC World Service.

ABC News also broadcasts Australian Football League matches on weekends in some states.

As of 2017, there were around 700 transmitters across Australia.

<doc id="1107500" wikidata="Q2599413" url="?curid=1107500" title="Stratford St. Mary">
<text>Stratford St. Mary is a village in Suffolk, England in the heart of &#x27;Constable Country&#x27;. John Constable painted a number of paintings in and around Stratford.

Stratford (the ford of the Roman &quot;Via Strata&quot;) with its attached hamlet of Higham sits on the Suffolk/Essex border on the River Stour, Suffolk. It is from London just off the A12 between Colchester and Ipswich. The village has a fifteenth-century flint faced church which is clearly visible from the A12. It is also served by a primary school, post office and village store, and three pubs. Stratford village is within the Stratford Vale which is also recognised as an area of outstanding natural beauty.

==History of the parish==
Evidence of Stratford&#x27;s antiquity includes traces of a &quot;henge&quot; from c. 4,000BC, and Roman remains on Gun Hill. The original Saxon settlement comprising 30 tenants and a mill mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 was abandoned as settlement grew along the river and the road to Bergholt.

A series of manorial court rolls beginning in 1318 reveal that many of the medieval families were connected with the wool trade which accounts for much of its early prosperity. Benefactors included wealthy clothiers like the Mors (or Morse) family who generously endowed the church. Stratford&#x27;s long, straggling main street lined with inns, provides evidence of its bustling prosperity in the coaching days when the town catered for a continuous traffic of cattle, turkeys and geese bound for the London market. The parish was in the hundred of Samford.

The national censuses from 1801 and 1901 record just over 500 inhabitants in the parish.

==Places of historical interest in the village==
Lowe Hill House, the finest of the surviving houses, dates from c.1480 and is described in the 1619 manorial survey, although it is probably not the original manor house.

Ravenys on one of the sites is the subject of a picture by John Constable entitled &quot;a house in Water Lane&quot;, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The Lord of the Manor made a grant of the land on which it stands to William Smyth and William Wade in 1442 on condition that they rebuilt the house for which the lord would provide timber for the &quot;grounsill, overweys and prynspales&quot;, the two Williams being responsible for the cutting and carting of it. It is impossible to be certain of the earlier names of the other two cottages, but the second structure, which incorporates a small portion of an earlier building stands on or very close to what was the home of the Wynter family. For 240 years from 1318 the Wynters farmed a smallholding in the meadows just south of it. The third house in the lane was most probably the home of the Selbricht family until it died out in 1558. The remaining house in this part of the village, which stands two hundred yards nearer to the river, was occupied by Matilda Hunt in 1481. The barn behind it is still known as Hunt&#x27;s Barn.

Gatemans, the home of weaver Ralph Gateman in 1334, is now the oldest surviving house in the village.

Thornes was the original name of the house front frontage behind Gatemans; significantly enlargened in the 19th century and later and is now known as Courtlands.

Fyshers was the original name of the house now occupied by the redbrick &quot;Old Cage House&quot;, named after the pound for stray cattle and horses that once occupied the site of the parish room cottage holding for the proverbial &quot;three acres and a cow&quot;.

Three original houses survive on the next six half acre holdings, the rest have been replaced as more cottages have been squeezed in.
Further towards the river in Lower Street the houses were always packed closer together. In 1587 Sir William Fisher the elder who lived either in Rose Bank or The Old Cottage next door complained of the noisy and noisome &quot;hoggiscote and hennesroust&quot; placed against his wall by Ralph Boyfield.

Three coaching inns – The Anchor, The Swan and the Black Horse – grew up as a result of the growing traffic through the village. The Anchor had of pasture for cattle bound for the London market. The Swan which is described in Road Books as a posting-house, had extensive stabling and accommodation for casual labourers who followed the progress of Haysel and Harvest from south to north through East Anglia. George II stayed here for a few hours in 1737. The Black Horse has connections with the highwayman Mathew Keys, hanged on Kennington Common in 1751, who once left his watch here as a pledge for a reckoning.

Goose acre, the marshy pightle attached to the Corner House, provided an overnight pen for geese and turkeys en route to London, as did the ground behind Riversdale house.

Fords, a fine timber house with a meadow alongside opposite the Black Horse, is close to a narrow strip of waste land which marks the line of the old London road. The road now passes close to the front of the cottages on the river bank now known as &quot;the Island&quot; and across the eastern end of the Talbooth Hotel.

Le Talbooth, originally known as &quot;Leggs&quot;, was formerly a pair of cottages with their own quay and lime kiln. Chalk was brought by barge from Great Cornard near Sudbury and coal from Manningtree and Mistley. It was first described as the &quot;Tolbooth&quot; in 1659. Merchandise was weighed here and tolls charged for upkeep of the tall, narrow toll bridge. The weirs and locks placed across the river made the area prone to flooding when the river rose.

Skalders, (now replaced by Riversdale, the modern house next to Fords) was the home of the Mors family for 200 years. Thomas Mors, the first to appear in the records, was one of three wealthy clothiers in the village, and a generous benefactor to the church. His wife Margaret Webb from Dedham and her parents played a large part in building and improving the church. Azal Mors, the last of the family, sold most of the family property in 1615 and left the village. His mother stayed in the family home to live on the rents of two or three cottages and her half share in the new water mill.

The old Stratford Mill shown in Constable&#x27;s painting dates from around 1600. A group of Sudbury Merchants and gentlemen formed &quot;The Stower Navigation Company&quot; in 1708, making the river navigable to bring coal upriver and to transport corn, straw and hay downstream to be offloaded and shipped to London. It was a busy, prosperous waterway until the railways took away the trade. The mill was demolished about 1850 and replaced by a vast structure of five floors with a undershot water wheel and an auxiliary steam engine for use when the river was low.

Stratford Hall Manor had three great Open Fields: Stregmer, Hatters Field and East Croft. The Common Meadow was about , running along the Stour between the river and the west side of the village.

Several substantial Tudor Halls were constructed by wealthy clothiers and gentry, including the Manor of Veyseys and Veyseys Farm; the Woadhouse and its attached buildings, built by Thomas Woadhouse of Dedham in 1501 to replace a much older hall called Afrettles; Typlands Farm, Leatherjacket Farm and Squirrels Hall to the north from c. 1480.

<text>The Bukit Panjang LRT (abbreviation: BPLRT) is an automated guideway transit line in Bukit Panjang, Singapore. The BPLRT is currently the only Light Rail Transit (LRT) line operated by SMRT Trains. As the name suggests, it serves 13 stations in the neighbourhood of Bukit Panjang and parts of Choa Chu Kang in the north-west area of the country. The line was the first LRT line constructed in Singapore, having been opened on 6 November 1999 by then-Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan.

It is a fully elevated and automated people mover system. The line currently uses the Innovia APM 100 C801, C801A and C801B rolling stock supplied by Bombardier, running in a two-car formation. With a 20-year design lifespan, a major overhaul of the system began in 2019 that is scheduled to complete in 2026, which include a new signalling system (Innovia APM 300R) and power rails system, as well as rolling stock.

==History==
===Planning and construction===
In November 1994, then-Communication Minister Mah Bow Tan announced that the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC) was conducting studies on the feasibility of a Light Rail Transit (LRT) system in the estate of Bukit Panjang. Subsequently, Bukit Panjang was one of the two locations selected for the construction of the first LRT systems in Singapore in December 1994, the other being at Queenstown and linked to Buona Vista MRT station, the latter of which was eventually not built. The tender for the design and construction of the LRT system in Bukit Panjang were called in December 1994, receiving eight bids.

In February 1996, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong announced that an LRT system in Bukit Panjang had been given the go-ahead, and was expected to be completed in three years. An exhibition about the system was organised by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) in April 1996, featuring models and maps of the stations on the line, and a booth at which visitors could vote for the colours of the rolling stock, and the shape of the station roofs. In the same month, the contract for the system&#x27;s design and construction was awarded to a consortium consisting of Keppel Corporation, Gammon, and Adtranz for .

On 5 August 1997, the LTA awarded SMRT a license to operate the LRT due to its experience with the MRT system. Testing on the line was underway by December 1998 and it commenced operations on 6 November 1999.

===Reliability issues===
Upon opening, the system suffered from reliability issues, having 32 service disruptions in its first six months of operation. Safety concerns regarding the system were also raised in Parliament in the wake of a collision between two trains in November 2000 that injured five passengers. Most of these issues were rectified by September 2001, and, by May 2002, the system was able to attain the government&#x27;s desired service levels.

However, a subsequent five-day service disruption in October 2002, caused by a loose guide wheel, led the LTA to conduct an audit on the maintenance procedures carried out for the line. The audit found that the training and procedures for maintenance were adequate, but the actual maintenance work was not properly done, and the LTA gave the line&#x27;s operator, Singapore LRT, six months to rectify the lapses found in the audit.

To rectify the issues with the system, Singapore LRT spent to replace worn-out wires in the line&#x27;s signalling system, from December 2003 to April 2004. Service levels on the line had improved to adequate standards by 2003, but a subsequent disruption of service in May 2004 led to the line&#x27;s operator initiating an internal probe into the matter.

Besides the reliability issues, the line was doing poorly financially, with Singapore LRT making annual losses of around to . Ridership on the line was also low, with around 40,000 commuters daily, 10,000 less than needed to break even, and was not expected to increase further, given a development slowdown in Bukit Panjang.

===Upgrades and capacity increases===
By 2010, ridership on the line had increased significantly, to around 47,000 commuters daily, and was expected to increase further. As the trains on the line had limited capacity to meet the demand, in November 2010, SMRT announced that they were contemplating capacity increases on the line. These capacity increases, in the form of 13 additional train cars, and a supplementary bus service between heavily used stations on the line and Choa Chu Kang, were announced by then-Transport Minister Lui Tuck Yew in July 2011. In addition, SMRT contracted Bombardier to conduct a study on how to improve the line&#x27;s reliability. The new trains entered service on the line in 2015.

In a bid to further improve reliability, in June 2015, the LTA and SMRT announced upgrades to the track, signalling systems, and electrical systems along the line, as faults in these areas had caused most of the service disruptions on the line. Later that month, Lui elaborated that the upgrades would comprise a 12-month study period to identify issues to rectify, and a several years long period in which the upgrades would be implemented. Additional staff were also deployed to improve service recovery and platform barriers were installed at all stations along the line by 2017.

In October 2016, as the line was approaching its 20-year design lifespan, LTA and SMRT announced that they were considering several courses of action regarding the system. These comprised the renewal of the existing system, or its complete replacement, either with a new system or with buses. On 8 March 2017, it was announced that the system&#x27;s power supply, signalling, rolling stock, track, and stations along with a new signalling system would be upgraded. The authorities ruled out scrapping the entire system or changing to automated guided vehicles drawn on self-power as it would cause major traffic congestion. On 3 October 2017, a tender for the revamp was called. To improve service reliability in the interim period, SMRT shortened operating hours on all Sundays from 12 November 2017 until the end of that year, which SMRT said allowed for additional time for maintenance.

On 7 March 2018, LTA awarded the contract for $344 million to Bombardier, the original supplier of the rolling stock, to fully upgrade the system. This includes overhauling the line&#x27;s signalling system with a communications-based train control (CBTC) system for a tighter headway between each train and thus, reducing waiting time. The 19 first-generation trains will be removed from service and replaced while the 13 second-generation trains will be refurbished. These upgrades are slated to be completed by 2026.

==Network and operations==
===Route===
Covering a distance of , the fully elevated line has 13 stations, and connects Bukit Panjang with Choa Chu Kang MRT/LRT station. From Choa Chu Kang station, the line runs east along Choa Chu Kang Way and Choa Chu Kang Road, before making a loop around Bukit Panjang.

===Services===
There are two services currently operating on the line: A and B, both of which terminate at Choa Chu Kang. Starting from 30 December 2024, Service A will resume full day operation on the weekdays.

===Stations===
All stations, except Choa Chu Kang, have two facing side platforms. Choa Chu Kang uses a Spanish solution, unique amongst Singapore MRT stations. All the stations on the LRT have half-height platform barriers, installed between 2016 and 2017. These platform barriers have fixed openings instead of platform doors, which the LTA attributed to insufficient space on the station platforms to install the equipment needed for platform doors. Choa Chu Kang station also has two additional platforms and a new set of fare gates to ease crowding during peak hours.

The stations on the line sport a conventional barrel-roof design, which was chosen by the Bukit Panjang residents when the BPLRT was being constructed.

====List====
==Rolling stock==
The Bukit Panjang LRT operates on the Bombardier Innovia APM 100 rolling stock, similar to the ones used by the Changi Airport Skytrain until 2006. An initial 19 trainsets were delivered in 1999 under C801, which bear a cerulean livery. An additional 13 trainsets were delivered in 2014 under C801A, bearing SMRT&#x27;s pixel livery and a slightly different exterior design. Each unit is long.

These trains, also known as automated people movers, are rubber-tyred for minimised operating noise within built-up areas and guided by a central guideway which also contains a power rail. They operate in both single-car and double-car arrangements, paired with a similar model (C801 and C801A trainsets are not cross-coupled). The trains are also equipped with windows that fog up automatically when the train runs near residential buildings.

19 Bombardier Innovia APM 300R trains have been procured under C801B as part of the Bukit Panjang LRT overhaul. These trains will be equipped with Communications Based Train Control (CBTC) signalling system and will replace the first generation C801 trains.

===Train formation===
Between 1999 and 2015, the trains operated in one-car (M) formations throughout the day. Two-car formations were only operated during weekday peak hours to accommodate increased demand prior to the introduction of C801A trains in 2014. Service B used to operate 2-car sets only during weekday morning peak hours, while Service A mostly operated them during weekday evening peak hours.

From 2015 until 2019, the majority of trains operated in two-car (M-M) formations. Two-car formations were no longer limited to peak hours due to the increase in ridership and number of apartments in Bukit Panjang.

Since 2019, all of the trains are running in two-car (M-M) formations throughout the day. The units are limited to a two-car train formation because of station length. Coupling is usually done in Ten Mile Junction Depot and the trains are coupled with the same car type: C801 + C801 or C801A (non-CBTC) + C801A (non-CBTC) or C801A (CBTC) + C801A (CBTC) or C801B + C801B. Occasionally units are mixed for reasons such as rescue operations or testing.

==Train control==
The line is equipped with Bombardier&#x27;s CITYFLO 550 fixed block signalling system for automatic train control (ATC) under automatic train operation (ATO) GoA 4 (UTO). The subsystems consist of automatic train protection (ATP) to govern train speed, Automatic Train Supervision (ATS) to track and schedule trains, and a computer-based interlocking (CBI) system that prevents incorrect signal and track points settings.

When the Bombardier Innovia APM 300R C801B enter service, the line will be upgraded to use Alstom’s Cityflo 650 moving block communications-based train control (CBTC) signalling system.

<text>Jesse Lamont Martin (&quot;né&quot; Watkins; January 18, 1969) is an American actor and singer. He is best known for his role of Tom Collins on Broadway in the musical &quot;Rent&quot; and performed on television as NYPD Detective Ed Green on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, Captain Joe West on &quot;The Flash&quot;, and professor Alec Mercer on &quot;The Irrational&quot;.

== Early life ==
Martin, the third of four sons, was born on January 18, 1969 in Rocky Mount, Virginia. His father, Jesse Reed Watkins (1943–2003), was a truck driver, and his mother, Virginia Price, a college counselor. He was born two months premature. His parents divorced when he was a child. His mother eventually remarried and Martin adopted his stepfather&#x27;s surname.

When Martin was in grade school, the family relocated to Buffalo, New York, but Martin began to dislike speaking because of his Southern accent and was often overcome with shyness. A concerned educator and mentor influenced him to join an after-school drama program and cast him as the pastor in &quot;The Golden Goose&quot;. Being from Virginia, the young Martin played the character the only way he knew how: as an inspired Southern Baptist preacher. The act was a hit, and Martin emerged from his shell. Martin attended high school at the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts. He later enrolled in New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts&#x27; theatre program. 

== Career ==
After graduation, Martin toured the states with John Houseman&#x27;s The Acting Company. He appeared in &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Rock-in-Roles&quot; at the Actors Theatre of Louisville and &quot;The Butcher&#x27;s Daughter&quot; at the Cleveland Play House, and returned to Manhattan to perform in local theatre, soap operas, and commercials. Finding that auditions, regional theater, and bit parts were no way to support himself, Martin waited tables at several restaurants around the city. He was serving a pizza when his appearance on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Guiding Light&quot; aired in the same eatery. While the show aired, the whole waitstaff gathered around the bar television to cheer his performance. 

Martin made his Broadway debut in &quot;Timon of Athens&quot;, and then performed in &quot;The Government Inspector&quot; with Lainie Kazan. While employed at the Moondance Diner, he met the playwright Jonathan Larson, who also worked on the restaurant&#x27;s staff. In 1996, Larson&#x27;s musical &quot;Rent&quot; took the theatre world by storm, with Martin in the role of gay computer geek/philosophy professor Tom Collins. The 1990s update of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La Bohème&quot; earned six Drama Desk Awards, five Obie Awards, four Tony Awards, and the Pulitzer Prize. In 1998, the West End production of &quot;Rent&quot; opened with four of the original cast members, including Martin. He played Tad in the concept album of &quot;Bright Lights, Big City&quot;.

In 2010, Martin returned to the stage for one of his biggest theater commitments since &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, performing in the productions of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; as a part of The Public Theater&#x27;s &quot;Shakespeare in the Park&quot; at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. He played the roles of Gratiano and King Polixenes, respectively. The two shows were performed in repertory, beginning with previews on June 9, 2010, through to the final performance on August 1, 2010.

&quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; later transferred to Broadway to the Broadhurst Theater for a limited engagement, in which Martin reprised his role as Gratiano. The show began previews on October 19, 2010, and officially opened on November 7. The show began a hiatus on January 9 to accommodate Al Pacino&#x27;s pre-existing obligations, and resumed from February 1, 2011, to February 20, 2011; Martin did not reprise his role after the hiatus due to other work commitments. He took part in a one-night-only reading benefit of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the opening of the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, alongside Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Raúl Esparza, and others on June 18, 2012.

=== Television work ===
Martin landed roles on Fox&#x27;s short-lived &quot;413 Hope St.&quot; and Eric Bross&#x27;s independent film &quot;Restaurant&quot; (1998). &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;″s creator, David E. Kelley, attended &quot;Rent&quot;″s Broadway premiere and remembered Martin when the show needed a new boyfriend for the title character. His performance as Dr. Greg Butters on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; caught the attention of David Duchovny, who cast Martin as a baseball-playing alien in a 1999 episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; titled &quot;The Unnatural&quot; that Duchovny wrote and directed.

While still shooting &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, Martin heard rumors that actor Benjamin Bratt planned to leave the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Martin had tried out for the show years before and won the minor role of a car-radio thief named Earl the Hamster, but decided to wait for a bigger part. With the opportunity presenting itself, Martin approached &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; producer Dick Wolf regarding the opening. Wolf hoped to cast him, and upon hearing that CBS and Fox both offered Martin development deals, he gave the actor the part without an audition.

From 1999 to 2008, he starred as Detective Edward &quot;Ed&quot; Green on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. Altogether, he was the fifth-longest serving cast member behind S. Epatha Merkerson, Sam Waterston, Jerry Orbach, and Steven Hill. He had a brief hiatus at the end of the 2004–2005 season while he was filming the movie adaptation of &quot;Rent&quot; in which he reprised the role of Tom Collins. Martin&#x27;s final episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; aired April 23, 2008, as he was replaced by Anthony Anderson. Martin returned to NBC a year later as the co-star of &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;.

On September 14, 2012, NBC announced that Martin would be joining the cast of &quot;Smash&quot; during season two for a nine-episode arc as Scott Nichols, the artistic director of the Manhattan Theatre Workshop. Martin also starred in an NBC pilot called &quot;The Secret Lives of Husbands and Wives&quot; as Greg Cooke, however it was not picked up to series.

Martin played Joe West in the superhero series &quot;The Flash&quot;, a spin-off from &quot;Arrow&quot; which premiered in October 2014. In the third season episode &quot;Duet&quot;, Martin played gangster Digsy Foss in Barry and Kara&#x27;s dreamworld. In its fifth season in 2018, a back injury forced Martin to take medical leave following the season&#x27;s fourth episode. From the start of the season until then he was almost always leaning against a wall or sitting down. Martin returned from medical leave in January 2019 with the season&#x27;s fifteenth episode. He departed as a series regular after the eighth season, having been cast in the NBC pilot &quot;The Irrational&quot;, in which he currently stars.

=== Film work ===
On March 4, 2013, it was announced that Martin would replace Lenny Kravitz as Marvin Gaye in &quot;Sexual Healing,&quot; an upcoming biopic directed by Julien Temple, and produced by Vassal Benton and Fred Bestall. Martin had been attached to the Marvin Gaye biopic for years and had stated that it was his dream role to portray the legendary Motown singer. With only three weeks to go on a planned nine-and-a-half week shoot, it was reported that production had stopped on the biopic, primarily due to financial problems (crew members were said to have not been paid fully for their work on the film). Approximately 70% of the film had been shot.

=== Other work ===
Martin narrated the audio book &quot;The Fire Next Time&quot; by James Baldwin and &quot;On the Shoulder of Giants, Volume 2: Master Intellects and Creative Giants&quot; by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He co-produced the off-Broadway production of &quot;Fully Committed&quot; with &quot;Rent&quot; co-star Adam Pascal (and two other producers).

Martin sits on the board of trustees for the Jonathan Larson Performing Arts Foundation along with &quot;Rent&quot; co-producer Kevin McCollum.

== Personal life ==
In October 2006, Martin returned to Buffalo, New York to work on an independent film (&quot;Buffalo Bushido&quot;), and was robbed two days after his arrival there.

In 2018, Martin suffered a back injury during the summer. He took a medical leave of absence from &quot;The Flash&quot; after recording scenes for a few episodes.

After residing in New York City for most his career, he now lives in Vancouver, BC.

<doc id="1107511" wikidata="Q31749" url="?curid=1107511" title="Hua Tuo">
<text>Hua Tuo ( 140–208), courtesy name Yuanhua, was a Chinese physician who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty. Historical texts, such as &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; record Hua Tuo as having been the first person in China to use anaesthesia during surgery. He used a general anaesthetic combining wine with a herbal concoction called &quot;mafeisan&quot; (; literally &quot;cannabis boil powder&quot;). Besides being respected for his expertise in surgery and anaesthesia, Hua Tuo was famous for his abilities in acupuncture, moxibustion, herbal medicine and medical &quot;daoyin&quot; exercises. He developed the &quot;Wuqinxi&quot; (; literally &quot;Exercise of the Five Animals&quot;) from studying the movements of the tiger, deer, bear, ape and crane.

==Historical accounts==


The oldest extant biographies of Hua Tuo are found in the official Chinese histories for the Eastern Han dynasty (25-220) and Three Kingdoms period (220–280) of China. The third-century historical text &quot;Records of Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;) and the fifth-century historical text &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; (&quot;Houhanshu&quot;) record that Hua Tuo was from Qiao County (), Pei Commandery () (in present-day Bozhou, Anhui) and that he studied Chinese classics throughout the Xu Province (covering parts of present-day Jiangsu and Shandong provinces). He refused employment offers from high-ranking officials, such as Chen Gui, and chose to practise medicine.

The dates of Hua Tuo&#x27;s life are uncertain. Estimations range from 110 to 207 CE, and from 190 to 265 CE. conclude that the &quot;best estimate&quot; is circa 145–208. Hua Tuo was an older contemporary of the physician Zhang Zhongjing (150–219).

The name Hua Tuo combines the Chinese surname Hua (, literally &quot;magnificent; China&quot;) with the uncommon Chinese given name Tuo ( literally &quot;hunchback&quot; or literally &quot;steep hill&quot;). He was also known as Hua Fu (; literally &quot;apply [powder/ointment/etc.]&quot;), and his courtesy name was Yuanhua (; literally &quot;primal transformation&quot;).

===Medical techniques===
Some scholars believe that he was responsible for the development of pressure points used in Chinese martial arts. Victor H. Mair describes him as &quot;many hundreds of years ahead of his time in medical knowledge and practice&quot;. 

Hua Tuo&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; describes him as resembling a Daoist &quot;xian&quot; (; &quot;immortal&quot;) and details his medical techniques. 

Hua Tuo&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Houhanshu&quot; explains this &quot;mafeisan&quot; &quot;numbing boiling powder&quot; decoction was dissolved in &quot;jiu&quot; (; literally &quot;alcoholic beverage; wine&quot;). His prescription for the &quot;mafeisan&quot; anaesthetic liquor was lost or destroyed, along with all of his writings. The &quot;Book of Sui&quot; lists five medical books attributed to Hua Tuo and his disciples, but none are extant.

=== Chen Deng ===
The subsequent portion of Hua Tuo&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; lists 16 medical cases: ten internal medicine, three surgical, two gynaecological, and one paediatric case. Hua Tuo&#x27;s treatment of diseases was centred on internal medicine, but also included surgery, gynaecology and paediatrics. He removed parasites, performed abortions and treated ulcers, sores and analgesia. For example: 

=== Cao Cao and execution ===
Cao Cao (155–220), a warlord who rose to power towards the end of the Han dynasty and laid the foundation for the Cao Wei state in the Three Kingdoms period, was probably Hua Tuo&#x27;s best known patient. He suffered from chronic headaches, which were possibly caused by a brain tumour. Cao Cao&#x27;s condition has also been translated as &quot;migraine headaches accompanied by mental disturbance and dizziness&quot; and the acupuncture point on the sole as identified as &quot;Yongquan&quot; (; &quot;bubbling fountain&quot;).

Cao Cao ordered Hua Tuo to be his personal physician – a job Hua Tuo resented. In order to avoid treating Cao Cao, Hua Tuo repeatedly made excuses that his wife was ill, but Cao Cao discovered the deception and ordered Hua Tuo&#x27;s execution. Xun Yu, one of Cao Cao&#x27;s advisers, pleaded for mercy on behalf of the physician. 

Hua Tuo wrote down his medical techniques while awaiting execution, but destroyed his &quot;Qing Nang Shu&quot; (; literally &quot;green bag book&quot;, which became a Classical Chinese term for &quot;medical practices text&quot;). This loss to traditional Chinese medicine was irreplaceable. Ilza Veith notes that, &quot;Unfortunately, Hua T&#x27;o&#x27;s works were destroyed; his surgical practices fell into disuse, with the exception of his method of castration, which continued to be practised. Due to the religious stigma attached to the practice of surgery, the social position accorded to the surgeon became increasingly lower and thus made a revival of Chinese surgery impossible.&quot;

A &quot;Liezi&quot; legend claims that the renowned physician Bian Que ( 500 BCE) used anaesthesia to perform a double heart transplantation, but the fourth-century text was compiled after Hua Tuo used &quot;mafeisan&quot;.

Cao Cao later regretted executing Hua Tuo when his son Cao Chong (196–208), a child prodigy who may have independently discovered and used Archimedes&#x27; principle, died from illness. The &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; does not specify Hua Tuo&#x27;s exact date of death, but since Cao Chong died in 208, Hua Tuo could not have lived past that year.

=== Disciples: Wu Pu and Fan A ===
Hua Tuo&#x27;s biography ends with accounts of his disciples Wu Pu () and Fan A (). Fan A was skilled at acupuncture and inserted the needles to extraordinary depths. Victor H. Mair notes this unusual name may indicate Fan A was a foreigner, and this area was around present-day Tongshan County, Jiangsu, the &quot;location of the first known Buddhist community in China&quot;. These herbs are &quot;qiye&quot; (; &quot;Toxicodendron vernicifluum&quot; leaves) and &quot;qingdian&quot; (; &quot;Sigesbeckia orientalis&quot;).

=== Legacy ===
The Song dynasty Confucianist scholar Ye Mengde (1077–1148) criticised the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; and &quot;Houhanshu&quot; biographies of Hua Tuo as being mythological. His essay, &quot;Physicians Cannot Raise the Dead&quot;, repeated the descriptions of Hua Tuo using anaesthesia to perform internal surgery, and reasoned, 

In later times, a set of 34 paravertebral acupuncture points was named &quot;Hua Tuo Jiaji&quot; () in his honour. Hua Tuo is considered a &quot;shenyi&quot; (, &quot;divine physician&quot;) and is worshipped as a medicinal deity or immortal in some Chinese temples. &quot;Hua Tuo zaishi&quot; (; &quot;Hua Tuo reincarnated&quot;) is also an honourable term of respect that will be bestowed to a highly-skilled physician. 

==Fictional accounts==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Hua Tuo heals the general Guan Yu, who is hit by a poisoned arrow in the arm during the Battle of Fancheng in 219. Hua Tuo offers to anaesthetise Guan Yu, but he simply laughs and says that he is not afraid of pain. Hua Tuo uses a knife to cut the flesh from Guan Yu&#x27;s arm and scrape the poison from the bone, and the sounds strike fear into all those who hear them. During this excruciating treatment, Guan Yu continues to play a game of weiqi with Ma Liang without flinching from pain. When Ma Liang asks him later, Guan Yu says that he feigned being unhurt to keep the morale of his troops high. After Hua Tuo&#x27;s successful operation, Guan Yu allegedly rewards him with a sumptuous banquet, and offers him a gift of 100 ounces of gold, but Hua Tuo refuses, saying that a physician&#x27;s duty is to heal patients and not to make profit. Although Hua Tuo historically died in 208, a decade before Guan Yu fought at the Battle of Fancheng, this story of him performing surgery on Guan Yu has become a popular artistic theme.

The historical document &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that there was actually a bone surgery performed on Guan Yu, and that Guan Yu, indeed, showed no pained expression. &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; gave neither the name of the surgeon nor the exact time of the operation.

Hua Tuo is later summoned by Cao Cao to cure a chronic excruciating pain in his head, which turns out to be due to a brain tumour. Hua Tuo tells Cao Cao that in order to remove the tumor, it would be necessary to open up the brain by cutting open the head, getting the tumor out, and sewing it back, with Cao Cao completely anesthesized in the process. However, Cao Cao suspects that Hua Tuo is planning to murder him, so he has Hua Tuo arrested and imprisoned. (Cao Cao&#x27;s suspicions are in part due to a previous attempt by Ji Ping, an imperial physician, to force him to consume poisoned medicine.)

In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Hua Tuo passes his &quot;Qing Nang Shu&quot; to a prison guard so that his medical legacy will live on. He dies in prison later. The prison guard&#x27;s wife burns the book for fear of being implicated, but the guard manages to salvage some pages, which are about how to emasculate hen and ducks; the other pages are lost forever.

==&quot;Mafeisan&quot;==
Hua Tuo&#x27;s innovative anaesthetic &quot;mafeisan&quot; (literally &quot;cannabis boiling powder&quot;, considered to be the first anaesthetic in the world) and supposedly used on Hua Tuo&#x27;s patients during surgery, is a long-standing mystery. The &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; both credit him as having created this anaesthetic during the Eastern Han dynasty. However, no written record or ingredients of the original have been found, although estimations have been made by Chinese medical practitioners in later periods. There is controversy over the historical existence of &quot;mafeisan&quot; in Chinese literature.

The name &quot;mafeisan&quot; combines &quot;ma&quot; (; &quot;cannabis; hemp; numbed&quot;), &quot;fei&quot; (; &quot;boiling; bubbling&quot;) and &quot;san&quot; (; &quot;break up; scatter; medicine in powder form&quot;). &quot;Ma&quot; can mean &quot;cannabis; hemp&quot; and &quot;numbed; tingling&quot; (e.g. &quot;mazui&quot; &quot;anesthetic; narcotic&quot;), which is semantically &quot;derived from the properties of the fruits and leaves, which were used as infusions for medicinal purposes&quot;.

Modern Standard Chinese &quot;mafei&quot; is reconstructed as Old Chinese *&quot;mrâipəts&quot;, Late Han Chinese &quot;maipus&quot; (during Hua Tuo&#x27;s life), and Middle Chinese &quot;mapjwəi&quot;.

Many sinologists and scholars of traditional Chinese medicine have speculated about the anaesthetic components of &quot;mafei&quot; powder. Frederick P. Smith contends that Hua Tuo, &quot;the Machaon of Chinese historical romance&quot;, used &quot;yabulu&quot; (; &quot;Mandragora officinarum&quot;) rather than &quot;huoma&quot; (; &quot;cannabis&quot;) and &quot;mantuolo&quot; (; &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;, &quot;nota bene&quot;, Hua&#x27;s given name &quot;Tuo&quot;) &quot;infused in wine, and drunk as a stupefying medicine&quot;.

Herbert Giles (1897:323) translates &quot;mafeisan&quot; as &quot;hashish&quot;; and his son Lionel Giles identifies &quot;hemp-bubble-powder&quot; as &quot;something akin to hashish or bhang&quot;. Ilza Veith quotes the sinologist Erich Hauer&#x27;s &quot;opinion that &quot;ma-fei&quot; () means opium&quot;. Victor H. Mair notes that &quot;mafei&quot; &quot;appears to be a transcription of some Indo-European word related to &quot;morphine&quot;&quot;. Although Friedrich Sertürner first isolated morphine from opium in 1804, Mair suggests, &quot;It is conceivable that some such name as morphine was already in use before as a designation for the anaesthetic properties of this opium derivative or some other naturally occurring substance.&quot; Wang Zhenguo and Chen Ping find consensus among &quot;scientists of later generations&quot; that &quot;mafei&quot; contained &quot;yangjinhua&quot; (; &quot;Datura stramonium&quot;) and &quot;wutou&quot; (; &quot;rhizome of &quot;Aconitum&quot;, Chinese monkshood&quot;) or &quot;caowu&quot; (; &quot;&quot;Aconitum kusnezofflin&quot;; Kusnezoff monkshood&quot;).

Lu Gwei-Djen and Joseph Needham suggest Hua Tuo may have discovered surgical analgesia by acupuncture, &quot;quite apart from the stupefying potions for which he became so famous – if so he kept it to himself and his immediate disciples so that the secret did not survive&quot;.

<text>The Banu Salama () were an Arab Hejazi family that governed the regions of Huesca and Barbitanya (Barbastro) in the Upper March of Al-Andalus from c. 780-800 CE. 

In 800, the former ally of the Banu Salama, Bahlul Ibn Marzuq, rebelled in Zaragoza, defeating the Banu Salama&#x27;s Arab allies along with the Banu Qasi in battle, taking the region and deposing the Banu Salama. Instrumental to their removal was the popular support garnered by Ibn Marzuq after public backing by theologian Ibn al-Mughallis.

<doc id="1107528" wikidata="Q8884513" url="?curid=1107528" title="Azobenzene">
<text>Azobenzene is a photoswitchable chemical compound composed of two phenyl rings linked by a N=N double bond. It is the simplest example of an aryl azo compound. The term &#x27;azobenzene&#x27; or simply &#x27;azo&#x27; is often used to refer to a wide class of similar compounds. These azo compounds are considered as derivatives of diazene (diimide), and are sometimes referred to as &#x27;diazenes&#x27;. The diazenes absorb light strongly and are common dyes. Different classes of azo dyes exist, most notably the ones substituted with heteroaryl rings.

==Structure and synthesis==

Azobenzene was first described by Eilhard Mitscherlich in 1834. Yellowish-red crystalline flakes of azobenzene were obtained in 1856. Its original preparation is similar to the modern one. According to the 1856 method, nitrobenzene is reduced by iron filings in the presence of acetic acid. In the modern synthesis, zinc is the reductant in the presence of a base. Industrial electrosynthesis using nitrobenzene is also employed.

&quot;trans&quot;-Azobenzene isomer is planar with an N-N distance of 1.189 Å. &quot;cis&quot;-Azobenzene is nonplanar with a C-N=N-C dihedral angle of 173.5° and an N-N distance of 1.251 Å. The trans isomer is more stable by approximately 50 kJ/mol, and the barrier to isomerization in the ground state is approximately 100 kJ/mol.
==Reactions==
Azobenzene is a weak base, but undergoes protonation at one nitrogen with a pKa = -2.95. It functions as a Lewis base, e.g. toward boron trihalides. It binds to low valence metal centers, e.g. Ni(Ph2N2)(PPh3)2 is well characterized.

Azobenzene oxidizes to give azoxybenzene. Hydrogenation gives diphenylhydrazine.

===Trans–cis isomerization===
Azobenzene (and derivatives) undergo photoisomerization of trans and cis isomers. cis-Azobenzene relaxes back, in dark, to the trans isomer. Such thermal relaxation is slow at room temperature. The two isomers can be switched with particular wavelengths of light: ultraviolet light, which corresponds to the energy gap of the π-π* (&quot;S2&quot; state) transition, for trans-to-cis conversion, and blue light, which is equivalent to that of the n-π* (&quot;S1&quot; state) transition, for cis-to-trans isomerization. For a variety of reasons, the &quot;cis&quot; isomer is less stable than the trans (for instance, it has a distorted configuration and is less delocalized than the trans configuration). Photoisomerization allows for reversible energy storage (as photoswitches).

====Spectroscopic classification====
The wavelengths at which azobenzene isomerization occurs depends on the particular structure of each azo molecule, but they are typically grouped into three classes: the azobenzene-type molecules, the aminoazobenzenes, and the pseudo-stilbenes. These azos are yellow, orange, and red, respectively, owing to the subtle differences in their electronic absorption spectra. The compounds similar to the unsubstituted azobenzene exhibit a low-intensity n-π* absorption in the visible region, and a much higher intensity π-π* absorption in the ultraviolet. Azos that are ortho- or para-substituted with electron-donating groups (such as aminos), are classified as aminoazobenzenes, and tend to closely spaced n-π* and π-π* bands in the visible. The pseudo-stilbene class is characterized by substituting the 4 and 4&#x27; positions of the two azo rings with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups (that is, the two opposite ends of the aromatic system are functionalized). The addition of this push-pull configuration results in a strongly asymmetric electron distribution, which modifies a host of optical properties. In particular, it shifts the absorption spectra of the &quot;trans&quot; and the &quot;cis&quot; isomers, so that they effectively overlap. Thus, for these compounds a single wavelength of light in the visible region will induce both the forward and reverse isomerization. Under illumination, these molecules cycle between the two isomeric states.

====Photophysics of isomerization====
The photo-isomerization of azobenzene is extremely rapid, occurring on picosecond timescales. The rate of the thermal back-relaxation varies greatly depending on the compound: usually hours for azobenzene-type molecules, minutes for aminoazobenzenes, and seconds for the pseudo-stilbenes.

The mechanism of isomerization has been the subject of some debate, with two pathways identified as viable: a &quot;rotation&quot; about the N-N bond, with disruption of the double bond, or via an &quot;inversion&quot;, with a semi-linear and hybridized transition state. It has been suggested that the &quot;trans&quot;-to-&quot;cis&quot; conversion occurs via rotation into the &quot;S2&quot; state, whereas inversion gives rise to the &quot;cis&quot;-to-&quot;trans&quot; conversion. It is still under discussion which excited state plays a direct role in the series of the photoisomerization behavior. However, the latest research utilizing femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy has suggested that the &quot;S2&quot; state undergoes internal conversion to the &quot;S1&quot; state, and then the &quot;trans&quot;-to-&quot;cis&quot; isomerization proceeds. Recently another isomerization pathway has been proposed by Diau, the &quot;concerted inversion&quot; pathway in which both CNN bond angles bend at the same time. There is experimental and computational evidence for the existence of a multistate rotation mechanism involving a triplet state.

====Photoinduced motions====
The photo-isomerization of azobenzene is a form of light-induced molecular motion. This isomerization can also lead to motion on larger length scales. For instance, polarized light will cause the molecules to isomerize and relax in random positions. However, those relaxed (&quot;trans&quot;) molecules that fall perpendicular to the incoming light polarization will no longer be able to absorb, and will remain fixed. Thus, there is a statistical enrichment of chromophores perpendicular to polarized light (orientational hole burning). Polarized irradiation will make an azo-material anisotropic and therefore optically birefringent and dichroic. This photo-orientation can also be used to orient other materials (especially in liquid crystal systems).

==Miscellaneous==
Azobenzene undergoes ortho-metalation by metal complexes, e.g. dicobalt octacarbonyl:

<text>Gordon Park is a northern suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Gordon Park had a population of 4,390 people.

== Geography ==
Gordon Park is located from the Brisbane CBD and is bordered by Kedron Brook to the east and south, and Stafford Road to the north.

Gordon Park shares an Australia Post postcode of 4031 with neighbouring suburb Kedron.

== History ==
The suburb was named after General Gordon who was the hero of the eight-month siege of Khartoum in the Sudan in the late 19th century. Most of the street names in the suburb relate to General Gordon, the armies he served with, and their sphere of operation (for example, Gordon Street, Khartoum Street, and Baker Street).

The Gordon Estate – Lutwyche of 264 blocks went to auction on 25 September 1886.

The Metropolitan Freehold Land and Building Company Limited advertised Gordon Park Estate for auction on 13 December 1890. It consisted of 1063 allotments (mostly of 16 to 20 perches). This estate was bounded by Stafford Road to the north, Gordon Street to the east, Kedron Brook to the south and Burnaby Street (now Burnaby Terrace) to the west, encompassing almost all of the present day suburb except for the south-western corner. However, the auctioneer G.T. Bell only sold 73 lots for an average price of £26 3s 7d (total £1,2917 10s).

On 27 March 1920, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 61 allotments in the south-west of the current suburb in the area of Granville Terrace (now Bedford Street), Aberdeen Terrace and Thistle Street (these did not form part of the 1890 subdivision). In June 1920, the auctioneers offered further blocks to the south of the March 1920 sales, in the area of Granville Terrace (now Bedford Street), Stirling Street and Montrose Street.

On 18 September 1920, auctioneers Isles, Love &amp; Co offered 150 allotments in the Glenkedron South Estate Section 2 (in the north-east of the current suburb). The allotments were in First Avenue (now Suez Street), Second Avenue (now Swan Street), Third Avenue (now Goulburn Street), Fourth Avenue (now Jack Street), Fifth Avenue (now Barron Street) and Seventh Avenue (now Rose Lane).

On 6 May 1922, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 98 allotments for sale in the north-west of the current suburb in the area of Main Happy Valley Road (Stafford Road), Haig Street, Burnaby Street (now Burnaby Terrace), Turner Road (now Alva Terrace) and Victoria Terrace. These were part of the ninth second of the Gordon Park estate that had been first offered in 1890.

On 11 November 1922, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 47 allotments in Section 1A of the Glen Park estate (as first offered in 1890). These allotments were in the area of Cowper Street, Hill Street (now Highland Street), Beaconsfield Terrace, Richmond Street and Khartoum Street.

On 8 December 1923, auctioneers Cameron Brothers offered 45 home sites in the area of Granville Terrace (now Bedford Street), Aberdeen Terrace and Thistle Street.

On 10 May 1924, auctioneers Isles, Love &amp; Co offered 24 remaining allotments in the Glenkedron South Estate in the north-east of the current suburb, which had been previously offered at auction in September 1920. All 24 allotments were sold.

In 1924, the Realty Development Company were selling suburban blocks (ranging from 16 to 20 perches) in the Tramway Extension Estate. This estate was bounded by Stafford Road to the north and Hill Street (now Highland Street) to the south and included Burnaby Street (now Burnaby Terrace), Turner Road (now Alva Terrace) and Victoria Terrace (and was part of the estate that was first offered in 1890 and again in 1922).

In 1926, the Gordon Park Baptist Church started as a tent mission on property at Khartoum Street which was owned by the church. It was originally known as the Gordon Park Mission Church. On 27 March 1926, a church building was officially opened on the corner of Khartoum and Hamilton Streets in the Grove Park Estate (approx ). The church rented a house, which became the home of the pastors on the corner of Groom and Thistle Streets until a manse was purchased and officially opened on 9 May 1953. The President of the Baptist Union of Queensland opened the church hall in 1961. A new church at 106 Khartoum Street () opened on 10 September 1977. The original pulpit from the old church along with a communion tray was donated to the Beenleigh Baptist Church.

On 28 July 1929, Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone of a new Catholic church and school. He returned to bless and open the new church and school on 3 November 1929. The building was on two levels with the school on the lower level with a capacity of 200 students and the church on the upper level with a capacity of 250 people. The intention was that a new larger church would be built later and the school occupy both levels of the original building. St Carthage&#x27;s Catholic Primary School opened on 8 July 1930; it was operated by the Sisters of Mercy. On 26 June 1966, the present brick church facing Beaconsfield Terrace was opened by Archbishop Patrick O’Donnell. The new buildings were designed by architects Corbett and Ryan and cost over $92,000, including furnishings. In November 1974, the Sisters of Mercy ceased to staff the school apart from one Sister for religious instruction. It was one of the first of the schools in the Brisbane Archdiocese to transition to lay control under headmaster Edward Benito Pender. However, the school was closed by the archdiocese in 1976 as it was felt that the enrolment of 86 students was insufficient to make the school financially viable.
On Saturday 19 October 1929, a site in Beaconsfield Terrace (near the junction with Cowper Street, approx ) was dedicated for a future Methodist church. On Saturday 20 September 1930 there was a stump capping ceremony as construction commenced on the church hall building. The hall was officially opened on Saturday 1 November 1930.

In November 1938, the Brisbane City Council announced that the tram to Gordon Park would be extended from Lutwyche Road via Bradshaw Street, crossing Kedron Brook into Thistle Street. Trams ran to Gordon Park connecting it with Brisbane until they were progressively withdrawn from use, finally ceasing all operations in Brisbane on 13 April 1969.

St John&#x27;s Anglican Church on the corner of Khartoum Street and Cowper Street (approx ) was dedicated on 2 August 1959 by Archbishop Reginald Halse. Its closure on 15 March 1987 was approved by Assistant Bishop George Browning.

On 11 August 1975, Gordon Park ceased to be a separate suburb. However residents lobbied against this decision and, on 18 December 1992, Gordon Park was reinstated as a suburb.

== Demographics ==
In the , Gordon Park had a population of 4,231 people.

In the , Gordon Park had a population of 4,853 people, 51.5% female and 48.5% male. The median age of the Gordon Park population was 36 years of age, 2 years below the Australian median age at 38 years. 77.3% (3.4 rise from 2016) of people living in Gordon Park were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.9%; the next most common countries of birth were England 3.1% and New Zealand 2.7%. 86.2% of people spoke only English at home; the next most popular languages were 1.4% Italian, 1.3% Spanish, and 1.0% Mandarin.

Gordon Park resident, Thomas Charles Nash, was born in Essex, England in 1909. He emigrated to Australia at the age of 17 aboard the S.S. Vedic, a ship chartered by the Salvation Army to bring 700 young emigrants to Australia. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1985 in recognition of his service to the local community. Prior to receiving the award he had received a certificate of merit for services to the incapacitated Servicemen&#x27;s Association, a RSL certificate of merit, honorary life membership of the RSL and the Paul Harris Fellowship medal from Rotary International. Tom Nash had also been a Brisbane City Council councillor.

<text>Nisa (; ; also Parthaunisa) was an ancient settlement of the Parthians, located near the Bagyr neighborhood of Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, 18 km west of the city center. Nisa is described by some as the first seat of the Arsacid Empire. It is traditionally assumed to have been founded by Arsaces I (reigned c. 250 BC–211 BC) and was reputedly the royal residence of the Parthian kings, although it has not been established that the fortress at Nisa was either a royal residence or a mausoleum.

In 2007, the fortress was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.

==History==
Nisa was a major trading hub in the Parthian Empire. It was later renamed Mithradātkert () by Mithridates I of Parthia (reigned c. 171 BC–138 BC). The region was famous for the beauty, agility and strength of its horses.

Nisa was totally destroyed by an earthquake during the 1st decade BC.

==Excavations==
Excavations at Nisa have revealed substantial buildings, mausoleums and shrines, many inscribed documents, and a looted treasury. Many Hellenistic art works have been uncovered, as well as a large number of ivory rhytons, and rims (coins) decorated with Iranian subjects or classical mythological scenes.

==Early life==
Merkerson was born Sharon Epatha Merkerson in Saginaw, Michigan, and raised in Detroit. She is the youngest of five children raised by her mother Ann who worked for the post office.

During a segment on the January 31, 2012, episode of &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot;, when asked about the origin of her name, Merkerson said that &quot;Epatha&quot; was the name of &quot;a grade-school teacher who was influential in keeping her father in school&quot;. Merkerson graduated from Cooley High School in 1970 and earned her Bachelor of Fine Arts in theatre at Wayne State University in 1976. She then went on to obtain her masters degree in fine arts from New York University in 1978. She was made an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters by Wayne State University in May 2009 and received the same distinction from the University of Maryland Eastern Shore in 2012, from Montclair State University in 2013, and from the University of Pittsburgh in 2017.

==Career==
In 1978, she moved to New York City.

Merkerson made her television debut as Reba the Mail Lady on &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;. Merkerson has also appeared on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, among other series.

She first appeared in the NBC police procedural drama &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in &quot;Mushrooms&quot; (Season 1: Episode 17) as the grief-stricken mother of an 11-month-old boy who is shot accidentally. Her performance impressed the producers enough to select Merkerson to replace Dann Florek as detective squad chief in the series&#x27; fourth season, making her one of the few actors to secure a recurring role after an initial single appearance on the show.

Merkerson&#x27;s career began to rise after she assumed the lead role in the one-woman play &quot;Lady Day at Emerson&#x27;s Bar and Grill&quot;. That was followed by her performance as Berniece in August Wilson&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize–winning play &quot;The Piano Lesson&quot;. For that, she was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Featured Actress in a Play. Merkerson has also won 2 Obie Awards for her work in &quot;I&#x27;m Not Stupid&quot; and &quot;Birdie Blue&quot;, a Helen Hayes Award for &quot;The Old Settler&quot;, and a Lucille Lortel nomination for &quot;F**king A&quot; by Suzan-Lori Parks. Her screen credits include &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, &quot;Loose Cannons&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;; and &quot;Navy SEALs&quot;. In 2006, she won a Golden Globe Award, an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild award for her performance in the HBO film &quot;Lackawanna Blues&quot;. In 2007, she starred as Lola Delaney in the Los Angeles stage production of William Inge&#x27;s &quot;Come Back, Little Sheba.&quot; In January 2008 the production opened a successful run on Broadway and earned Merkerson her second Tony nomination.

On April 1, 2010, it was confirmed that after 17 seasons, Merkerson would leave &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; at the end of the show&#x27;s twentieth season. Her departure from &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, which aired on May 24, 2010, was also the show&#x27;s final episode. In total, Merkerson appeared on the series for 17 consecutive seasons—395 episodes—which was more than any other actor associated with the program.

In 2012, Merkerson became the host of &quot;Find Our Missing&quot;, a reality-reenactment series on TV One which profiles missing people of color. She performed in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot; as Lydia Hamilton Smith, housekeeper to Tommy Lee Jones&#x27;s character, Congressman Thaddeus Stevens.

In 2014, Merkerson appeared in the Primary Stages production of &quot;While I Yet Live&quot;, written by Billy Porter. In 2015, she joined the cast of NBC medical drama &quot;Chicago Med&quot; as Sharon Goodwin, Chief of Patient and Medical Services. The series was conceived and written by &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; creator Dick Wolf, along with Matt Olmstead, Derek Haas and Michael Brandt. 2014, Merkerson became a spokesperson for Merck America&#x27;s Diabetes Challenge, to increase Type 2 diabetes awareness among African Americans.

==Personal life==
Merkerson appeared on the television series of Henry Louis Gates&#x27; &quot;Finding Your Roots&quot; on February 5, 2019 (Season 5, Episode 5), in which she revealed that she was a descendant of Isaac Hawkins and eight others of the 272 enslaved people who were sold in the 1838 Jesuit slave sale by Jesuit priests. These priests owned plantations on which the enslaved people tilled tobacco; proceeds from the sale were used to pay off the debts of the Jesuit-operated Georgetown College (now Georgetown University).

<text>William Shipley (baptised: 2 June 1715 – 28 December 1803) was an English drawing master, social reformer and inventor who, in 1754, founded an arts society in London that became The Royal Society of Arts, or Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce (RSA).

==Life==

===Early years, training and career===
Shipley was born in Maidstone, Kent, the son of Jonathan Shipley (d. 1749, originally of Walbrook, London) and Martha (née Davies), and baptised on 2 June 1715. He had a brother Jonathan Shipley, who became the Bishop of St Asaph, and whose son William Davies Shipley became Dean of St Asaph. William grew up in the City of London. His father died when he was just three years old, and William was sent to live with his maternal grandfather. At the age of 21, he inherited £500 and used that money to practice as a painter and drawing master in Northampton. At this point, he also joined the Northampton Philosophical Society, where he began his philanthropic life by raising funds to buy fuel for the poor.

Around 1750, Shipley moved to London and set up a drawing-school near Fountain Court in The Strand (at the east corner of Beaufort Buildings), which was known first as &quot;Shipley&#x27;s Academy&quot; and later as &quot;Ackermann&#x27;s Repository of Arts&quot;. The school proved highly successful, and among Shipley&#x27;s pupils were Richard Cosway, Thomas Jones, William Pars, and Francis Wheatley. Although Shipley had many students who went on to become famous artists, he himself was not remembered for his artwork.

===The Society of Arts===
From Shipley&#x27;s school, came the idea for a &quot;Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce&quot; He published his proposals for the society in 1753, which he hoped would make Great Britain a center for intellectual advancements in the areas of arts and sciences. The resulting organisation first met at Rawthmell&#x27;s coffee house on the north side of Henrietta Street, in Covent Garden on 22 March 1754. Founding members included Viscount Folkestone, Lord Romney (1712–1794), Isaac Maddox, Stephen Hales, and Thomas Baker, the naturalist. A &quot;plan&quot; of Shipley&#x27;s devising was published in 1755 in folio, where the aims of the society were stated, &quot;to promote the arts, manufactures, and commerce of this kingdom by giving honorary or pecuniary rewards, as may be best adapted to the case, for the communication to the society, and through the society to the public, of all such useful inventions, discoveries, and improvements as tend to that purpose&quot;.

Historian Pierre-Nicolas Chantreau (1741–1808) was said to marvel &quot;that such an institution was founded, not by those who held reins of government, but by William Shipley, &quot;cultivateur modeste&quot; The society would award premiums for different discoveries and inventions: &quot;There appeared in the daily and evening papers a notice announcing premiums or awards&quot; They offered premiums for the discovery of cobalt and the raising and curing of madder, for example. These were not just frivolous concerns but matters of Britain&#x27;s most important industry, namely, textiles. According to Colley, &quot;Cobalt dyes a brilliant blue and the madder was the principal source of all red dies until the 19th century&quot;. Quite simply, the society wanted to enable Britain&#x27;s most important industry, its textile manufacturers, to be able to dye their cloth at home rather than send it abroad.&quot;

Colley goes on to say that the Society was also busy trying to solve the problem of finding enough native timber for the building of ships. This was a matter of Britain&#x27;s national defence. Without timber, the Royal Navy could not build ships.The Society carried out this purpose by establishing prizes for the growing of trees, such as Oaks, chestnuts, Elms and Firs. They once offered a premium to anyone able to develop a scheme to transport breadfruit from the East to the West Indies. Shipley raised the money for the endeavour through subscriptions. He also encouraged people to make new and more accurate maps by awarding special prizes to encourage exploration. Shipley&#x27;s contributions to both England&#x27;s economy and England&#x27;s security through the Society were substantial.

===The inventor, and later years===

Shipley was elected a &quot;perpetual member&quot; of the society in February 1755, and was presented with a gold medal by the society in 1758. But it is probable that he became less interested in the society as its sphere gradually became more technical and industrial; At any rate, he resigned his post as registrar in 1760. On 23 November 1767, William Shipley married Elizabeth Miller, and seems to have retired to Maidstone about 1768. The couple&#x27;s first child was born in 1769 but died after two months. In 1771, The second child, Elizabeth was born. Shipley, under the auspices of Lord Romney, founded a local institution, &quot;The Kentish Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge&quot;, along the lines of the Society of Arts. In 1783 the society was instrumental in improving the sanitation of Maidstone gaol, and so preventing the &quot;gaol fever&quot;, which had ravaged the prison population of the country.

Shipley was an inventor in his own right. He came up with ideas on how to provide inexpensive fuel for the poor, a floating light to save those lost in the sea (for which he received an award), a way to establish new species of fish in ponds around England, and perhaps strangest of all, a method of lining your shoes with tinfoil to keep them dry.

Shipley died in Maidstone, aged 89, on 28 December 1803. A monument was erected to his memory in the north-west corner of churchyard of All Saints Church, Maidstone. Richard Cosway painted an oil portrait of Shipley, and there is also a portrait, drawn and engraved by William Hincks, in the National Portrait Gallery. There is a mezzotint by John Faber the Younger of a painting by Shipley of a man blowing a lighted torch.

==Legacy==
Shipley historical significance was summed up by David Allen in his biography: &quot;Shipley&#x27;s life included in its span the surge of English Commercial self-confidence which Defoe celebrated and which was to be feared by Napoleon, the spectacular first stage of the industrial Revolution from the flying shuttle to steam-powered cotton mills, the flowering of English genius in the arts from Hogarth to Turner, and the growth of English philanthropic endeavor from the first county hospitals to Hannah More&#x27;s &quot;Age if Benevolence.&quot; In the shaping of these momentous developments Shipley which was both distinctive and significant.

Many credit Shipley with helping to establish the role of private organisations to serve the public; the Crown of England was so preoccupied with war and money dealings, it had little resources to further enhance culture at the time. &quot;Merely by existing,the society challenged the way that the British state was organised. To begin with, by taking on certain tasks, they underlined just how much the state left undone.

The &quot;William Shipley Group for RSA History&quot; is named after him.

<doc id="1107544" wikidata="Q567086" url="?curid=1107544" title="Annihilator (band)">
<text>Annihilator is a Canadian thrash metal band founded in Ottawa in 1984 by Jeff Waters. Waters is the band&#x27;s sole constant member and has acted as its guitarist, bandleader, writer, producer, engineer, and occasional bassist and vocalist. Annihilator has released seventeen studio albums and has undergone many line-up changes, with Waters regularly assembling touring or session musicians to perform with him. Along with Sacrifice, Voivod and Razor, Annihilator has been referred to as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of Canadian thrash metal. They are also considered to be part of the &quot;second wave&quot; of thrash metal bands from the late 1980s and early 1990s.

Annihilator is the highest-selling Canadian heavy metal group, although most sales have been generated outside of Canada. The band&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;Alice in Hell&quot; (1989) and &quot;Never, Neverland&quot; (1990), are considered to be influential Canadian metal records. Many of their later albums — including their third and only major-label album &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot; (1993) — also received praise from critics, and enjoyed success in Europe and Japan. Their most recent studio album of original material, &quot;Ballistic, Sadistic&quot;, was released in 2020.

==History==
===Early years (1984–1988)===

Annihilator was formed in Ottawa, Ontario, by Jeff Waters and guitarist John Bates. Waters said he named the band after the tank that Eddie Murphy&#x27;s character rode on in the 1984 film &quot;Best Defense&quot;. Waters and Bates wrote and recorded the song &quot;Annihilator&quot; (not to be confused with the song of the same name released on the 1994 album, &quot;King of the Kill&quot;). This original version of &quot;Annihilator&quot; was released on the special edition of the 2005 album &quot;Schizo Deluxe&quot;.

Waters and Bates then recruited drummer Paul Malek and bassist Dave Scott. In 1985, the band produced a demo titled &quot;Welcome To Your Death&quot;. Bates and Scott left the band before its release, citing &quot;artistic differences&quot; and &quot;personality conflicts&quot;. In 1986, Waters and Malek recorded another demo, &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot;. A third demo, &quot;Wicked Mystic&quot; / &quot;Word Salad&quot; was recorded by Waters and Malek in 1987 and sent only to labels. Waters then moved to Vancouver, where he assembled an entire line-up, including drummer Ray Hartmann and former D.O.A. bassist Randy Rampage on vocals. In 1988 and 1989, Waters recorded guitar and bass tracks and produced what would become the band&#x27;s debut album. Once the album was finished, he hired bassist Wayne Darley and guitarist Anthony Greenham for touring.

===Rise to fame (1989–1993)===
In 1988, Annihilator was signed to Roadrunner Records and released their debut album, &quot;Alice in Hell&quot;, in April of the following year. The band embarked on its first world tour, opening up for Onslaught in Europe on their &quot;In Search of Sanity&quot; tour, and along with Wrathchild America, they supported Testament in North America on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Practice What You Preach&quot; tour. The band also opened for Exodus and Metal Church. After the tour to support &quot;Alice in Hell&quot; ended in December 1989, frontman Randy Rampage left Annihilator to retain his seniority at a job on the shipping docks in North Vancouver.

Rampage was replaced by former Omen singer Coburn Pharr and the band released their second album, &quot;Never, Neverland&quot;, in 1990. The album&#x27;s sales surpassed &quot;Alice in Hell&quot;, becoming the band&#x27;s only album to chart in the UK, peaking at No. 48. Annihilator spent half a year touring with such bands as Reverend, Pantera and Xentrix, and opened for Judas Priest on the latter&#x27;s &quot;Painkiller&quot; tour in Europe. After the &quot;Never, Neverland&quot; tour ended in the spring of 1991, Hartmann and Pharr left the band and were replaced by Mike Mangini (though the band would find a more permanent replacement in Randy Black) and Aaron Randall, respectively.

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, distributed by Epic Records, was released in 1993 and was successful in Europe and Asia, but did poorly in the United States. It saw Annihilator toning down the speed and thrash elements of its predecessors in favour of a more radio-friendly sound. Bassist Wayne Darley left the band in August 1993 as he was unable to enter Japan, where the band was touring in support of the album. The band embarked on extensive tours to promote &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, touring in Europe with Coroner and in North America with Lillian Axe, and appearing at the Dynamo Open Air festival in the Netherlands. Also in 1993, Annihilator was dropped by then-surging Roadrunner Records.

===Temporary hiatus, return and more albums (1994–2002)===
Annihilator temporarily dissolved, but Waters kept the band name going when he, along with drummer Randy Black, recorded and released 1994&#x27;s &quot;King of the Kill&quot;. Black played the drums; Waters wrote the songs (the title track and a few others with John Bates) and played the rest of the instruments. This album was an improvement from &quot;Set the World on Fire&quot;, as it returned to the thrashier sound of the early albums, and leaned towards a groove-oriented vein. Bassist Cam Dixon then joined the band, followed by Lou Bujdoso from Meatwagon. In 1996, the band released &quot;Refresh the Demon&quot;, which was, for the most part, a return to the speed and technicality of the band&#x27;s earlier days.

That was followed, in the next year, by &quot;Remains&quot;, a more industrial metal-oriented album. Waters is the only musician on the album (he used a drum machine); by this time, he was the sole band member.

Inspired after seeing Slayer perform in Vancouver in the summer of 1998, Waters decided to reunite the &quot;Alice in Hell&quot; line-up to record another album. All members apart from Wayne Darley, who had health problems, agreed to reunite. Bassist Russ Bergquist joined the band in Darley&#x27;s place. This line-up released &quot;Criteria for a Black Widow&quot; and toured successfully. However, Rampage was fired following the tour for his erratic and often drunken behaviour. Then-Overkill guitarist and former Liege Lord frontman Joe Comeau requested to replace him during the tour, while Curran Murphy replaced Davis on guitar and Randy Black rejoined on drums.

During the early 2000s, Annihilator released the albums &quot;Carnival Diablos&quot; (2001) and &quot;Waking the Fury&quot; (2002), both very critically successful. After considerable success, the band&#x27;s line-up once again dissolved.

===The Dave Padden era (2003–2013)===

Following years of line-up changes, Jeff Waters decided to work with a touring-only line-up so he recruited Dave Padden as a permanent vocalist/rhythm guitarist, while Waters recruited touring bassists and drummers. Annihilator&#x27;s first two albums in this three-man band format as Waters played both bass and guitar, with Padden on vocals and a hired drummer were &quot;All for You&quot; (2004) and &quot;Schizo Deluxe&quot; (2005). Mike Mangini rejoined for the former album in 2004 and Tony Chappelle was hired for the latter&#x27;s recording in 2005.

In 2007, Annihilator released their twelfth album &quot;Metal&quot;. It features several guest performers, such as Corey Beaulieu (Trivium), Willie Adler (Lamb of God) and Jeff Loomis (Nevermore). The band&#x27;s self-titled thirteenth album was released in 2010, coming to be in a more modern thrash metal-styled sound.

Annihilator returned to Canada for two live shows, making it the first time since 1993 that the band had played live in North America. On July 10, 2011, Annihilator headlined the Quebec City Imperial Theatre to a sold-out crowd. They played the main stage (along with KISS and Motörhead) on July 24, 2011 at Montreal&#x27;s Heavy MTL Festival.

Annihilator released their fourteenth studio album, &quot;Feast&quot;, on August 23, 2013.

===Departure of Dave Padden and &quot;Suicide Society&quot; (2014–2016)===
In the summer of 2014, Oscar Rangel replaced Al Campuzano, their bassist since 2010. Jeff Waters said on his Facebook that he had actually contacted Wayne Darley, the band&#x27;s bassist from the classic early 1990s line-up, about having him rejoin, although once again he declined, in Jeff&#x27;s words &quot;Wayne wanted to do it but couldn&#x27;t ... personal reasons.&quot; The band has continued their touring cycle since then.

Dave Padden left the band sometime in December 2014 via a phone call to Jeff Waters, informing him of his desire to step away from the constant touring in order to spend more time with his family. Waters unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Padden to remain in the band, offering him a pay rise. He later admitted in a German radio interview to being emotionally shaken by the departure. After a number of weeks searching for a replacement vocalist, Waters decided that he would handle vocals himself once again, in addition to doing everything but play drums in the studio. Padden&#x27;s departure was not made public until six months later, in June 2015, when Waters made an announcement on Annihilator&#x27;s Facebook page, but attaching a YouTube link directly below of audio snippets from various songs on the band&#x27;s then-upcoming album, &quot;Suicide Society&quot;. Canadian metal guitarist Aaron Homma from Killitorous, Erimha and Vital Remains was announced as Paddens replacement on guitar while Waters returned to vocals.

&quot;Never, Neverland&quot; singer Coburn Pharr surprised audiences when he returned for a short time on the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise in January 2015. Pharr performed the songs Reduced to Ash, The Fun Palace, I Am In Command, Road to Ruin and Stonewall.

By April 2015, Annihilator had begun work on their fifteenth studio album. Waters stated that the album&#x27;s musical direction would be &quot;something quite different.&quot; The album, titled &quot;Suicide Society&quot;, was released on September 18, 2015.

Drummer Mike Harshaw announced via his Facebook page in May 2016 that he had parted ways with Annihilator amicably after four years in order to spend more time with his family as well as to pursue other musical interests as he continued work with his own band, Prismind. Fabio Alessandrini joined Annihilator shortly thereafter.

In September 2016, Annihilator played Calgary Metalfest alongside fellow Canadian speed/thrash metal pioneers Exciter, Razor, Sacrifice and a local band Gatekrashör.

In late November 2016, the band announced a compilation album, entitled &quot;Triple Threat&quot;, which was released through UDR Records on January 27, 2017. The album consists of three discs, including one containing Annihilator&#x27;s Jeff Waters, Aaron Homma, and Rich Gray (formerly Hinks) along with other artists playing an acoustic set of the band&#x27;s most well-known ballads and acoustic songs, all done in single takes. The second and third discs were released as Blu-ray DVDs, one containing Annihilator&#x27;s full set at Bang Your Head Festival in Germany, and the other containing a documentary profiling the band&#x27;s extensive career.

===&quot;For the Demented&quot;, &quot;Ballistic, Sadistic&quot; and upcoming eighteenth studio album (2017–present)===
By the end of 2016, Annihilator had begun working on their sixteenth studio album. Waters stated, &quot;On the next one, the changes I&#x27;m gonna make… I only said two things. I&#x27;ve got all these people telling me, &#x27;You&#x27;ve gotta go back to this album,&#x27; or that album, or that album, or that album. &#x27;You&#x27;ve gotta do this,&#x27; &#x27;You&#x27;ve gotta do that.&#x27; So what I do is I block it out. But I&#x27;ve decided that I&#x27;m going to not worry about catchy, commercial choruses — &#x27;commercial,&#x27; as in you remember it, where you intentionally make that chorus the most important part of the song and you want people to remember that one every time. That kind of is the opposite of what I used to do in the earlier days. In the earlier days, I would go, &#x27;I don&#x27;t care about the chorus being the main part; I want the whole song to be cool.&#x27; So therefore the choruses were not as commercial or catchy. And they remained heavy back then; the choruses would end up being heavy. Whereas on my &quot;Suicide Society&quot; record I just did, you could have a heavy song, but then you hit the chorus and you go, &#x27;Woah, that&#x27;s pretty mainstream stuff in the choruses.&#x27; And the other thing was, since I&#x27;m such a fan of so many bands, I let myself go a little bit on the last album with being too blatantly obvious with my influences and my musical loves as a fan. So you really heard a song that had a lot of the &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; era of music from Metallica, and you really heard a Megadeth-y song on there, and you really heard in my vocals some Hetfield and Mustaine-isms. And I think that was great, as a fan, to get it out, but I think I need to do more of my own thing on the next record.&quot;

In February 2017, Waters said that the sixteenth Annihilator studio album was being co-produced and co-engineered by bassist Rich Gray, making it the &quot;first time I&#x27;ve actually had somebody else in the studio since 1990 (&quot;Never, Neverland&quot;) working with me on stuff.&quot; On September 12, 2017, it was announced that the album was titled &quot;For the Demented&quot;, and would be released on November 3; more details on the album, including track listing and artwork, and the music video for &quot;Twisted Lobotomy&quot; were released on the same day. In support of &quot;For the Demented&quot;, Annihilator (along with Death Angel) opened for Testament on the European &quot;Brotherhood of the Snake&quot; tour, which took place in November and December 2017. The band toured Europe twice in 2018; first with Testament and Vader in March and April, and toured there again from October to December.

On August 14, 2018, former Annihilator vocalist Randy Rampage (who sang on the albums &quot;Alice in Hell&quot; and &quot;Criteria for a Black Widow&quot;) died of an apparent heart attack, at the age of 58.

In September 2018, Waters reported that Annihilator would release their seventeenth studio album in 2019. He later confirmed that it would be released in January 2020. On October 10, 2019, Annihilator released &quot;I Am Warfare&quot; as the lead single of the album, now titled &quot;Ballistic, Sadistic&quot;, which was released on January 24, 2020.

In 2019, Waters got married and moved to England. The band released &quot;Metal II&quot;, a near complete re-recording of their 2007 album &quot;Metal&quot;, on February 18, 2022, which serves as a tribute to Eddie Van Halen and Alexi Laiho, the latter of whom appears posthumously on one of the album&#x27;s re-recorded tracks &quot;Downright Dominate&quot;, which also features Dave Lombardo on drums and Stu Block on vocals. In January 2022, Jeff Waters announced that he would be once again stepping down as lead vocalist and focusing solely on lead guitar while Block would handle lead vocals on the band&#x27;s future live shows.

In June 2023, Waters announced on social media that he had completed work on the next Annihilator album.

Coburn Pharr died on February 25, 2025, at the age of 62.

== Influences ==
In a 2013 interview with Photogroupie.com, Waters acknowledged his influences, stating: &quot;I started listening to Elton John, Kiss, Sweet, AC/DC then it evolved from hard rock with electric guitar to Black Sabbath and the heavier stuff, Judas Priest, Maiden, Loudness, Van Halen was coming in. Then I get turned on to the thrash stuff, so then it was Razor, Exciter... Those first albums were a huge influence on metal bands.&quot; Elsewhere in the interview, Waters talked about the impact Iron Maiden had on him and the band: &quot;They&#x27;re all great...but Bruce Dickinson is one brilliant, unique, gifted, talented person...the guy&#x27;s a genius.&quot;

<text>Columbia was a supercomputer built by Silicon Graphics (SGI) for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), installed in 2004 at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility located at Moffett Field in California. Named in honor of the crew who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, it increased NASA&#x27;s supercomputing capacity ten-fold for the agency&#x27;s science, aeronautics and exploration programs.

Missions run on Columbia include high-fidelity simulations of the Space Shuttle vehicle and launch systems, hurricane track prediction, global ocean circulation, and the physics of supernova detonations.

==History==
Columbia debuted as the second most powerful supercomputer on the TOP500 list in November 2004 at a LINPACK rating of 51.87 teraflops, or 51.87 trillion floating point calculations per second. By June 2007 it had dropped to 13th.

It was originally composed of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 3700 512-processor multi-rack systems running SUSE Linux Enterprise, using Intel Itanium 2 Montecito and Montvale processors. In 2006, NASA and SGI added four new Altix 4700 nodes containing 256 dual-core processors, which decreased the physical footprint and the power cost of the supercomputer. The nodes were connected with InfiniBand single and double data rate (SDR and DDR) cabling with transfer speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second.

The SGI Altix platform was selected due to a positive experience with Kalpana, a single-node Altix 512-CPU system built and operated by NASA and SGI and named after &quot;Columbia&quot; astronaut Kalpana Chawla, the first Indian-born woman to fly in space. Kalpana was later integrated into the Columbia supercomputer system as the first node of twenty.

At its peak, Columbia had a total of 10,240 processors and 20 terabytes of memory, 440 terabytes of online storage utilizing SGI&#x27;s CXFS filesystem, and 10 petabytes of archival tape storage. The Project Columbia team, composed mostly of computer scientists and engineers from NAS, SGI, and Intel, were awarded the Government Computer News (GCN) Agency Award for Innovation in 2005 for deploying Columbia&#x27;s original 10,240 processors in an unprecedented 120 days.

It was slowly phased out as its successors at NAS, the petascale Pleiades supercomputer and the Endeavour shared-memory system, expanded to meet with NASA&#x27;s growing high-end computing needs. At the time of its decommissioning in March 2013, Columbia was made up of four nodes over 40 SGI Altix 4700 racks, containing Intel Itanium 2 Montecito and Montvale processors to make up a total of 4,608 cores with a theoretical peak of 30 teraflops and total memory of 9 terabytes.

<doc id="1107553" wikidata="Q6059782" url="?curid=1107553" title="Invasive species in Australia">
<text>Invasive species are a serious threat to endemic Australian species, and an ongoing cost to Australian agriculture. Numerous species arrived with European maritime exploration and colonisation of Australia and steadily since then. There is ongoing debate about the potential benefits and detriments of introduced species; some experts believe that certain species, particularly megafauna such as deer, equids, bovids, and camels, may be more beneficial to Australia&#x27;s ecosystems than they are detrimental, acting as replacements for extinct Australian megafauna.

Management and the prevention of the introduction of new invasive species are key environmental and agricultural policy issues for the Australian federal and state governments. the management of weeds cost A$1.5 billion on weed control and a further $2.5 billion in lost agricultural production over the course of a year.

== Causes ==
Both geologic and climatic events helped to make Australia&#x27;s flora and fauna unique. Australia was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Zealandia. Gondwana began to break up 140 million years ago (mya); at 50 mya, Australia separated from Antarctica, and was relatively isolated until the collision of the Indo-Australian Plate with Asia in the Miocene epoch, 5.3 mya. As Australia drifted, it was isolated from the evolutionary pressures in the rest of the world. Other examples of island isolation include Madagascar, New Zealand, Socotra, the Galapagos and Mauritius. The geographic isolation of Australia created a sharp division between Australian fauna and Asian fauna at the Wallace line.
Humans arrived in Australia between 80,000 and 45,000 years ago, living alongside megafauna for 20,000–25,000 years before the megafaunal extinctions that were likely caused by, or partly contributed to by, late Pleistocene climate change; however, the full reason for the extinctions is still unclear and human hunting or habitat changes through fire-stick farming may also have contributed to the extinctions. This left Australia with much of its keystone species extinct, leaving the ecosystems altered and far more vulnerable to invasion.

Dingoes probably arrived in Australia between 5,400 and 4,600 years ago, long after the first humans, spread rapidly across the continent and probably contributed to the extinction of even more native species such as the thylacine and Tasmanian devil.The current period of invasive species introduction began in 1788 with the arrival of the first European settlers. The population density in Australia beyond the coastline and major cities has been very low since the arrival of European settlers, and there are large tracts of land where it is very difficult for people to manage even large feral animals like camels, horses, donkeys and water buffalos.

==Invasive species==
===Fungi and bacteria===
Invasive fungi and bacteria in Australia affect many native plants and animals and agricultural crops. Citrus canker was found twice in the Northern Territory in the 1900s, and was eradicated each time. In 2004, an outbreak of citrus canker occurred in Australia, and many Queensland citrus orchards have been burned to remove the disease. The destruction worked; however, the disease was once again detected in April 2018 and confirmed in May 2018 in Northern Territory and Western Australia. The &quot;Oomycete&quot; &quot;Phytophthora cinnamomi&quot;, commonly known as wildflower dieback or jarrah blight, has created a massive problem in some types of native vegetation – especially jarrah forest and banksia woodland.

===Animals===
&lt;section begin=animals_table/&gt;Australia is host to 56 introduced invasive vertebrate animal species. They can be categorised in the following ways:

* &quot;Invasive&quot; – species has a tendency to spread their range into new areas or plague their range
* &quot;Ferals&quot; – defined as animals imported for domestic purposes (i.e. pets, recreational use – such as hunting – or beasts of burden) that have gone wild.
* &quot;Pests&quot; – animals that have a direct effect on human standard of living or the environment/ecosystems in areas where they are present, have a high rate of reproduction and are difficult to control

Animals causing most public concern and economic and ecological damage include:

&lt;section end=animals_table/&gt;

====Control====

Various programs exist to control invasive species in Australia. A cane toad control program aims at preventing the spread of the species towards Darwin and Western Australia, and involves trapping. Red Foxes, feral cats, feral dogs and feral pigs are often baited, although the use of 1080 (sodium fluoroacetate) is also known to affect native animals such as the quoll and Tasmanian devil, though the most common and effective method is shooting. 1080 is ideal in the south-west of Australia because a native plant contains the same toxin – therefore most native animals have developed immunity to it. Other species are either open to hunting as a sport (such as the deer) or subject to government sponsored culling programs. Dromedary Camels and Water buffalo are often shot from helicopters.

Several bounty programs have assisted in the eradication of larger sized pests in Australia.

Ironically, many early bounties were paid for the extermination of native species that were considered a pest to farmers. The Tasmanian tiger or thylacine was one such program that caused extinction, whilst the Tasmanian devil, spotted quoll, and Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle all became seriously threatened by bounties.

At various times, bounties have been in place for invasive species such as wild-living domestic dogs (including the dingo) and fox. A beer-for-toads bounty has been publicised for cane toad control in the Northern Territory.

In 2002, a Victorian Fox Bounty Trial began to test the efficacy of fox bounties which have been in place intermittently since 1893 (only 30 years after introduction). The study showed no reduction in fox impacts, and that the project may even have been counterproductive. The evaluation also found that a sustained annual reduction of 65% is required to achieve real declines in red fox populations.

Feral cat bounties in Queensland have also been considered to counter the growing problem. The dingo is subject to various controversial bounty systems in Australia. The Australian dingo was itself introduced before European settlement, yet has been considered native of the mainland in most cases both the pure breeds and the Dingo-dog hybrids are considered pests to livestock.

====Invasive insects and terrestrial arthropods====

Insects are the second costliest class of invasive species in Australia, behind only the mammals. Fire ants in Australia (&quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot;) are estimated to cost annually, making up 71% of the total costs of invasive insects. This is followed by the Queensland fruit fly (&quot;Bactrocera tryoni&quot;) making up 12% of the total costs, the Pacific fruit fly (&quot;Bactrocera philippinensis&quot;) making up 9%, and the bollworm (&quot;Helicoverpa&quot;) making up 7%.

Yellow crazy ants (&quot;Anoplolepis gracilipes&quot;), black Portuguese millipedes (&quot;Ommatoiulus moreletii&quot;), Western honey bees (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;), and European wasps (&quot;Vespula germanica&quot;; known elsewhere by the common name &quot;German wasps&quot;) are considered to be problematic species. The elm leaf beetle (&quot;Xanthogaleruca luteola&quot;), discovered in Victoria in 1989, devastates exotic elm trees, themselves imported, and a parasite wasp species as well as the beetle&#x27;s natural enemy the parasitic fly (&quot;Erynniopsis antennata&quot;) were in turn introduced in 2001 in an effort to control the pest.

=====Control=====
The red imported fire ant in particular, with its venomous stings, poses a direct threat to human lifestyle. Although control is extremely difficult and spread quickly, the species is currently effectively quarantined to South East Queensland.

Both the honey bee and European wasp are well established and now impossible to eradicate in Australia. Honey bees take over potential nesting hollows for native animals and are very hard to remove once established.

The yellow crazy ant is currently quarantined to Christmas Island where it has had a significant environmental impact. The primary impact is the killing and displacing of crabs on the forest floor.

====Invasive birds====
Introduced birds considered pests include the common myna, the common starling, the spotted dove and rock pigeon (common pigeon).

Initially introduced to control locust plagues, the Indian myna breeds prolifically in urban environments in the eastern states. The myna poses a serious threat (such that it has been listed in the World Conservation Union&#x27;s world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species). The bird has caused human health concerns due to the spread of mites and disease. It has also been known to force native birds and their eggs from their nests.

The rock pigeon in particular has acidic faeces and can damage human property, including historic stone buildings.

=====Control=====

Historically, control programs have struggled to curb the expansion and proliferation of invasive bird populations in Australia. A new program in Canberra has reversed this trend regarding mynas. Since 2006, the Canberra Indian Myna Action Group (CIMAG) has implemented an effective control scheme, based upon large-scale trapping conducted by volunteers. As of June 2013, the Action Group has recorded over 45,000 myna captures in the Canberra region since 2006. This has reduced the myna&#x27;s prevalence in the Canberra region from a ranking of third most prevalent bird species in 2006, to twentieth in 2012. This has correlated with anecdotal evidence of increased nesting activity and prevalence of native species in the Canberra region. Other volunteer organisations in Australia have begun to adopt the CIMAG model with similar success.

Starlings and sparrows are currently closely monitored in south-eastern Western Australia.

Despite the number of rock pigeons, many people continue to feed the birds bread crumbs and assist them to breed in great numbers. It is not illegal to feed pigeons in Australia, and many local proposals to cull pigeons have been rejected.

Programs promoting indigenous plantations to attract native birds are an alternative method of promoting native species rejuvenation though this has caused issues with the explosion in the Noisy miner population.

====Invasive freshwater fish species====

Invasive freshwater fish species in Australia include carp, brown trout, rainbow trout, redfin perch, mosquitofish (&quot;Gambusia&quot; spp), weather loach, and spotted tilapia among others. Some introduced freshwater fish species have had devastating impacts on Australia&#x27;s endemic freshwater fish species and other native aquatic life. For example, in much of south eastern Australia&#x27;s freshwater systems introduced carp (often incorrectly called &quot;European&quot; carp) dominate the lowland reaches, while introduced trout species almost completely dominate the upland reaches. While the damaging impact of carp is well recognised, little in the way of control measures have been employed to control their spread. Their ability to colonise almost any body of water, even those previously considered to be beyond their physical tolerances, is now well established.

====Invasive marine species====

A number of marine pests have arrived in Australia in the ballast water of cargo ships. Marine pests include the black-striped mussel (&quot;Mytilopsis sallei&quot;), the Asian mussel, the New Zealand green-lipped mussel, and the European shore crab. The Northern Pacific seastar in Tasmania, Inverloch, and Port Phillip has caused much localised environmental damage.

===Invasive plant species===

Weeds invade natural landscapes, waterways, and agricultural land. Originally, plants were most likely to be considered weeds if they had a direct economic impact, especially on agricultural production. However, growing environmental consciousness since the 1970s has led to the recognition of environmental weeds; plants which have adverse effects on the natural ecosystem of an area. A list of Weeds of National Significance (WONS) was created in 1999 and updated in 2012 and now has 32 taxa.

Not just the prickly pear: Hudson&#x27;s Pears - &quot;Cylindropuntia tunicata&quot; and &quot;C. rosea&quot; - are also cacti of agricultural significance in Queensland.

Weed management costs the Australian economy A$4 billion yearly; weeds are considered the second greatest threat to biodiversity after land clearing. Almost half of Australia&#x27;s 220 declared noxious weeds (under legislation) were introduced deliberately, one third of these as garden ornamentals.

==Management of invasive species==
The management of invasive species is carried out by individuals, conservation groups, and government agencies.

The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is responsible for ensuring that no new species with the potential to become invasive species enter Australia. To raise public awareness, Australian Quarantine has featured Australian celebrity nature lover Steve Irwin on a series of television commercials, with the message &quot;Quarantine – Don&#x27;t mess with it&quot;.

Several scientific bodies are involved in research for the control of invasive species. The CSIRO has released several successful biological pest control agents and developed chemical agents for pest and weed control. For example, the CSIRO released myxoma virus to control wild rabbits in Australia.
Rabbit haemorrhagic disease escaped containment from an Australian Government research facility and spread across Australia. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease was subsequently legalised for the control of wild rabbits. The moth &quot;Cactoblastis cactorum&quot; was introduced for the control of prickly pear, and the salvinia weevil &quot;Cyrtobagous salviniae&quot; for the control of aquatic weed &quot;Salvinia&quot;. More doubtful biological controls were the cane toad, which was introduced to control the sugar cane destroying cane beetle; instead the cane toad ate anything and everything else—the beetle was not its preferred food source given choice. The cane toad in Australia has become the biological control that is most infamous for having been a complete failure as well as becoming an environmental nightmare. Walter Froggatt, an economic entomologist, warned of this likelihood at the time. It has also led to much public concern and caution when considering the introduction of new biological controls.

Another example of a poorly researched introduced biological control is the sap sucking lantana bug (&quot;Aconophora compressa&quot;) also from South America that was introduced into Australia in the 1995 to eat the lantana. Unfortunately, the lantana bug also attacks other trees including fiddlewood trees which has caused distress to some gardeners. The lantana bug had been tested for six years on 62 different plants. &quot;Aconophora compressa&quot; was the 28th insect introduced to control lantana in about 80 years.

More successfully, the Australian Dung Beetle Project (1965–1985), led by Dr. George Bornemissza of CSIRO&#x27;s Division of Entomology, introduced 23 species of dung beetle to Australia in order to biologically control the pestilent population of bush flies. These flies, along with other species of fly and parasitic worm, use the dung as a breeding and feeding ground. The rolling and burying activity of the dung beetles means that the dung is removed from the pasture land, which had the effect of reducing the bush fly population by 90%, as well increasing soil fertility and quality by recycling the dung back into the soil.

Cooperative Research Centres for weed management and pest animal control, have been established by the federal government. They coordinate research and funding between a number of university and government labs for research into control of invasive species.

Non government organisations have also been established to fight invasive species, for example, the Invasive Species Council (ISC). The ISC are a policy, advocacy, lobbying, research, and outreach group on matters related invasive species.

Volunteer groups, such as SPRATS, have also made very significant contributions to fighting invasive species, in their case removing sea spurge from large areas of Tasmanian coastline.

==Claimed ecological benefits==
While negative impacts by introduced flora and fauna are often featured, some researchers argue that there could be positive aspects of introduced species to provide ecological benefits to native ecosystem in Australia. 

Herbivores in general may benefit local biodiversity by creating mosaics of vegetation and helping native plants to expand their ranges, and may contribute to decline wildfires; mega-herbivores most notably the feral camels may fill lost ecological niches of extinct Australian megafauna including &quot;Diprotodon&quot; and &quot;Palorchestes&quot;, where this may also apply for others (such as cattles and horses and donkeys and deers), and would also drop fire risk, and smaller herbivores such as hog deer or feral goats may also suppress introduced grasses and wildfires. 

Carnivores such as the introduced red foxes or cats may control the number of rats – and rabbits – and eradication of these carnivores may damage native ecosystem indirectly.

==Economic impact==
A 2021 study looking at the economic impact of invasive species estimated that invasive species had cost Australian farmers in the past 60 years, with feral cats way ahead of the pack at nearly . Rabbits are next, at around , followed by fire ants, annual ryegrass, pigs, parthenium, foxes, ragwort, cucumis melons, and common heliotrope.

==World Trade Organisation and Australia&#x27;s quarantine regulations==
The World Trade Organisation specified quarantine regulations are weaker than Australia&#x27;s fairly stringent regulations controlling the importing of raw produce. Following Australia&#x27;s membership of the WTO, many forms of raw produce once banned have commenced import, with potentially adverse effects and controversy; for example, regarding proposals to import apples from New Zealand or bananas from the Philippines.

Australian quarantine regulations such as those limiting banana imports from developing economies have been recognised as protectionist trade barriers by economists including Kevin Fox, head of Economics at the Australian School of Business. 
The weakening of restrictions on importing raw produce into Australia mandated by the &quot;World Trade Organisation Future&quot; may pose risks of introducing exotic disease organisms. Case examples include, Chytrid fungus that is threatening numerous Australian frog species with extinction and mass pilchards deaths in the Southern Ocean from 1995 onwards that are suspected to have been caused by a virus that may have been brought in with imported pilchards.

<text>Suske (English: Willy, Luke, Bob, Spike) is one of the main characters in the popular Belgian comic strip &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; by Willy Vandersteen. He is the boy of the duo.

==History==

When Willy Vandersteen created his first adventure story with the characters Wiske, Tante Sidonia and Professor Barabas, &quot;Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije&quot; (&quot;Rikki and Wiske in Chocowakije&quot;) (1945) he already gave the little girl Wiske a boy companion called &quot;Suske&quot;. However, in this early incarnation the boy was her older and stronger brother. Also, Vandersteen&#x27;s publisher had changed the character&#x27;s name into &quot;Rikki&quot; without his knowledge, let alone with his approval. This turned out to be for the better, since Vandersteen felt that the character was way too old to be a good companion to the much younger Wiske. He also resembled Tintin too much. Thus, at the start of the next story, &quot;Op Het Eiland Amoras&quot; (&quot;On The Isle of Amoras&quot;) (1945) Vandersteen sent Rikki off to get a ration stamp for shoes and effectively wrote him out of the series. In the course of the story Wiske, Sidonia and Barabas travel to the isle of Amoras where Wiske meets a local orphan named Suske. He explains to her that he is the last living relative of Sus Antigoon, his great-great-great-grandfather. Wiske joins him in the Amorasians&#x27; battle against their oppressors. At the end of the story Suske is adopted by aunt Sidonia and travels back to Belgium.

Suske was named after Vandersteen&#x27;s father, Sus Vandersteen. The diminutive &quot;-ke&quot; in Flemish dialect means &quot;little&quot;, thus &quot;Suske&quot; would translate back to &quot;Little Sus&quot;. In some stories his full name, François, is mentioned, but not often.

==Character==

Suske is somewhat of a flat character. He is brave, honest, helpful, smart, polite, heroic, strong and has no real flaws in the way that Wiske or Lambik have. This also explains why he is the least popular character in the franchise. In &quot;Het Eiland Amoras&quot; he often went berserk whenever someone said the battle cry &quot;Seefhoek vooruit!&quot; (the &quot;Seefhoek&quot; was the neighborhood in Antwerp where Vandersteen grew up. In reprints this was changed to &quot;Antigoon vooruit!&quot;). This element was dropped in later stories.

Despite being one of the main protagonists of the series Suske is rarely the focus of the stories. In &quot;De Stalen Bloempot&quot; (&quot;The Steel Flowerpot&quot;) (1950) Suske is brought back to his native Amoras to become king. At the end of the story he abdicates because he doesn&#x27;t want to leave his friends behind. In &quot;Het Ros Bazhaar&quot; (&quot;The Horse Bazhaar&quot;) (1974) Suske runs away from home, because he feels the others don&#x27;t understand him. He does this again in &quot;De Curieuze Neuzen&quot; (&quot;The Curious Noses&quot;) (2007), but this time because he feels unwanted seeing he is an orphan. In &quot;De Goalgetter&quot; (1990) Suske becomes an association football champion and his success goes to his head. In &quot;Het Gebroken Dorp&quot; (2014) Suske becomes count of Marchimont, after saving the city from a local curse.

==Relation with Wiske==

Suske and Wiske are best friends, despite quarreling once in a while. One of the recurring storylines is Wiske&#x27;s jealousy whenever Suske receives attention from other young, attractive females.

==In spin-offs==

Suske plays the central role in the spin-off series &quot;Amoras&quot;. The first volume is named after him. He is also the central character in the junior version &quot;Klein Suske en Wiske&quot; (&quot;Little Suske and Wiske&quot;).

==In popular culture==

Both he and Wiske have their own statue in the Antwerp Zoo in Antwerp. It was sculpted by René Rosseel in 1978. They also have a statue in Middelkerke, sculpted by Monique Mol in 2002.

On June 15, 1995 an illustrated wall was dedicated to Suske and Wiske in the Laekenstraat in Brussels, Belgium.

Suske and Wiske are also part of an illustrated wall in the Korte Ridderstraat 8 in Antwerp, which was revealed on May 13, 2006. On April 24, 2009 a similar wall was revealed in Kalmthout.

In the 1975-1976 Dutch TV puppet series &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; Suske&#x27;s voice was done by Paula Majoor.

In the 1994 musical &quot;De Stralende Sterren&quot; David Verbeeck played the part of Suske. In the 2002 musical &quot;De Spokenjagers&quot; Suske was played by Sébastien De Smet. Niels Destadsbader played Suske in the 2008 musical &quot;De Circusbaron&quot;.

In the 2004 live-action film &quot;&quot; Joeri Busschots played Suske. In the 2009 3-D animated feature film &quot;Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers&quot; Marijn Klaver played Luke (Suske).

<doc id="1107562" wikidata="Q2667500" url="?curid=1107562" title="Wiske">
<text>Wiske (English: Wanda, Suzy, Bobette, Lucy) is one of the main characters in the popular Belgian comic strip &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; by Willy Vandersteen. She is the girl of the duo. Together with Lambik she is one of the most popular characters in the franchise.

==History==

Wiske made her debut in the very first &quot;Suske and Wiske&quot; story &quot;Rikki en Wiske in Chocowakije&quot; (1945) (&quot;Rikki and Wiske in Chocowakije&quot;). Her companion in this story is her older and stronger brother Rikki, who was written out of the series at the start of the next story &quot;Het Eiland Amoras&quot; (1945-1946) (&quot;The Isle of Amoras&quot;). When Wiske travelled to the isle of Amoras along with Tante Sidonia and Professor Barabas she met Suske there, who took Rikki&#x27;s place as her male companion.

Wiske is adopted by her aunt, Tante Sidonia. It is never directly implied, but just like Suske she is likely an orphan, as her parents are never seen around.

Vandersteen named Wiske after the Flemish opera singer Wiske Ghijs. Her real name is &quot;Louisa&quot;, but this is hardly used in the series. The nickname &quot;Wiske&quot; is a Flemish diminutive form of &quot;Louisa&quot;.

==Character==

Contrary to Suske Wiske is more flawed as a person. She is stubborn, prone to anger and jealousy, too curious for her own good and can be vain, disobedient, lazy and impulsive. However, she still has a heart of gold. Her impulsiveness and curiosity often bring her and others in trouble. This also explains why more stories center around her than the good-natured Suske. Just like Lambik Wiske is one of the most popular characters in the franchise because readers can relate to her human personality flaws more.

==Relation with Suske==
Suske and Wiske are best friends, despite quarreling once in a while. One of the recurring storylines is Wiske&#x27;s jealousy whenever Suske receives attention from other young, attractive females.

==Schanulleke==

Wiske has a little doll, Schanulleke, whom she carries along with her wherever she goes. She adores her doll so much that she is heartbroken whenever it is lost or someone threatens to destroy it.

==Wiske&#x27;s story-concluding wink==

Wiske traditionally concludes every story by winking at the audience, which has become a trademark of the franchise.

==In spin-offs==

Suske plays the central role in the spin-off series &quot;Amoras&quot;. The first volume is named after him. He is also the central character in the junior version &quot;Klein Suske en Wiske&quot; (&quot;Little Suske and Wiske&quot;).

==In popular culture==

Both she and Suske have their own statue in the Antwerp Zoo in Antwerp. It was sculpted by René Rosseel in 1978. They also have a statue in Middelkerke, sculpted by Monique Mol in 2002.

On June 15, 1995 an illustrated wall was dedicated to Suske and Wiske in the Laekenstraat in Brussels, Belgium.

Suske and Wiske are also part of an illustrated wall in the Korte Ridderstraat 8 in Antwerp, which was revealed on May 13, 2006. On April 24, 2009 a similar wall was revealed in Kalmthout.

In the 1975-1976 Dutch TV puppet series &quot;Suske en Wiske&quot; Wiske&#x27;s voice was done by Helen Huisman.

In the 1994 musical &quot;De Stralende Sterren&quot; Hilde Vanhulle played the part of Wiske. In the 2002, musical &quot;De Spokenjagers&quot; Wiske was played by Femke Stoop. Liesbeth De Wolf played Wiske in the 2008 musical &quot;De Circusbaron&quot;.

In the 2004 live-action film &quot;&quot; Céline Verbeeck played Wiske. In the 2009 3-D animated feature film &quot;Luke and Lucy: The Texas Rangers&quot; Evelien Verhegge played Lucy (Wiske).

<text>The Birch–Murnaghan isothermal equation of state, published in 1947 by Albert Francis Birch of Harvard, is a relationship between the volume of a body and the pressure to which it is subjected.

== Expressions for the equation of state ==
The third-order Birch–Murnaghan isothermal equation of state is given by
formula_1
where &quot;P&quot; is the pressure, &quot;V&quot;0 is the reference volume, &quot;V&quot; is the deformed volume, &quot;B&quot;0 is the bulk modulus, and &quot;B&quot;0&#x27; is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. The bulk modulus and its derivative are usually obtained from fits to experimental data and are defined as
formula_2
and
formula_3
The expression for the equation of state is obtained by expanding the Helmholtz free energy in powers of the finite strain parameter &quot;f&quot;, defined as
formula_4
in the form of a series.
This is more evident by writing the equation in terms of &quot;f&quot;. Expanded to third order in finite strain, the equation reads,
formula_5
with formula_6.

The internal energy, , is found by integration of the pressure:
formula_7

<text>Getaway is Australia&#x27;s longest-running travel and lifestyle television program. Debuting on 14 May 1992 in a Thursday 7:30pm time slot, it is broadcast on the Nine Network and TLC. Its main competitor was &quot;The Great Outdoors&quot; on the Seven Network until 2009.

The first season looked at only tourism locally, including resorts and locations, but on 18 March 1993, it had expanded to look at international travel and tourism destinations.

In 2011, the program was reduced to a 30-minute format and moved to Saturday afternoons at 5:30pm.

<doc id="1107572" wikidata="Q537479" url="?curid=1107572" title="Alan Fersht">
<text>Sir Alan Roy Fersht (born 21 April 1943) is a British chemist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, and an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. He was Master of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge from 2012 to 2018. He works on protein folding, and is sometimes described as a founder of protein engineering.

==Early life and education==
Fersht was born on 21 April 1943 in Hackney, London. His father, Philip, was a ladies&#x27; tailor and his mother, Betty, a dressmaker. His grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland, Romania, Lithuania and Belarus. He was educated at Sir George Monoux Grammar School, an all-boys grammar school in Walthamstow, London. He was a keen chess player and was the Essex County Junior champion in 1961. He was awarded a State Scholarship to read Natural Sciences at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he obtained First Class in Pt I of the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1964, First Class in Pt II (Chemistry) in 1965 and was awarded his PhD degree in 1968. He was President of the University of Cambridge Chess Club in 1964–65 and awarded a half blue in 1965.

==Career and research==
Fersht spent a post-doctoral year (1968–1969) at Brandeis University working under William Jencks. He returned to Cambridge in 1969 as a group leader at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology until 1977 and a junior research fellow at Jesus College, Cambridge until 1972. Fersht was Wolfson Research Professor of the Royal Society and Professor of Biological Chemistry at Imperial College London from 1978 to 1988. He spent a sabbatical year at Stanford University on an Eleanor Roosevelt Fellowship of the American Cancer Society with Arthur Kornberg (1978–79). Fersht was Herchel Smith Professor of Organic Chemistry at Cambridge from 1988 to 2010. He was the Director of the Cambridge Centre for Protein Engineering from 1990 to 2010 when, on reaching the retirement age, he became an Emeritus Group Leader at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology. He is a Fellow of both Gonville &amp; Caius College and Imperial College.

Alan Fersht is widely regarded as one of the main pioneers of protein engineering, which he developed as a primary method for analysis of the structure, activity and folding of proteins. He has developed methods for the resolution of protein folding in the sub-millisecond time-scale and has pioneered the method of phi value analysis for studying the folding transition states of proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/0022-28369290561-W|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1017/S0033583523000045-W|noedit&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His interests also include protein misfolding, disease and cancer.

<doc id="1107578" wikidata="Q3227233" url="?curid=1107578" title="The Sketch Show">
<text>The Sketch Show is a British television sketch comedy programme, featuring many leading British comedians. It aired on ITV between 2001 and 2004. The show was first commissioned in 2001 and was co-produced by a company owned by Steve Coogan. Despite the first series winning the BAFTA Television Award for Best Comedy, the second series was cancelled due to poor viewing figures. Lee Mack states in his autobiography &quot;Mack The Life&quot; that the final two episodes have never been broadcast.

A spinoff of the same title was produced in the United States. It was cancelled after 4 episodes and had a run of 6 episodes.

The show started at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1999, and starred Mack, Catherine Tate and Dan Antopolski. Mack later expressed regret at not including them in the TV show, stating: &quot;I&#x27;m not a great believer in regret, but looking back over the last eighteen years of me doing this job, not keeping our sketch show Bits together and jumping at the first offer to put a version of it on telly is probably the biggest mistake I&#x27;ve made.&quot;

== Cast ==
The original line-up of the cast was Lee Mack, Jim Tavaré, Tim Vine, Karen Taylor and Ronni Ancona.

For the second series, Kitty Flanagan replaced Ancona, who left to concentrate on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Alistair McGowan&#x27;s Big Impression&quot; (which was shortened to simply &quot;Big Impression&quot; to reflect Ancona playing as many parts as McGowan himself). Again, sketches featured performers using their own names.

With the exception of some child actors in certain sketches, there were no guest stars at any point during the programme.

== Writers ==
All of the cast contributed to the writing of the show; however, Lee Mack is credited as the lead writer. Other comedic writers/actors, such as Jimmy Carr, John Archer, Ricky Gervais, Matthew Hardy, John Mann, Stephen Colledge and Daniel Maier were also responsible for the show&#x27;s humour, though as mentioned earlier, were not featured in the show.

== DVD ==
A DVD of the first season was released by Visual Entertainment in Australia on 12 September 2005. It is a region-free DVD and the only extra on the disc is a short photo gallery. All 8 episodes on the single-disc release are combined into a 3-hour feature. The opening and closing credits have been removed for all episodes, and a number of sketches have been edited out to fit the series onto a single disc.

== International versions ==

=== United States ===
An American version of the show, produced by Kelsey Grammer, aired in early 2005 on Fox. The main cast consisted of Malcolm Barrett, Kaitlin Olson, Mary Lynn Rajskub, and Paul F. Tompkins, as well as Lee Mack from the British version of the show. Grammer appeared in short opening and closing segments in each episode.

Many of the sketches from the British version were recreated, such as the California Dreamin&#x27;, English Course, and Sign Language sketches.

A notable sketch from this version had Grammer waking up from a nightmare, which he describes as: &quot;I dreamt that &quot;Frasier&quot; was over, and I was on this Sketch Show!&quot; The sketch is a spoof of the &quot;Newhart&quot; series finale.

The series was filmed in London, England at Teddington Studios, with a British audience.

Only six episodes of the show were made, and it was cancelled after only four of them had been shown, but all six were aired with the last airing on 19 April 2005.

It was replaced by &quot;American Dad!&quot; on 6 February 2005.

=== Canada ===
A Quebec version ran between 2004 and 2006 on the channel TVA. Most sketches in this version are translations or adaptations of British and Australian sketches with little original material. The main cast consisted of Emmanuel Bilodeau, Réal Bossé, Édith Cochrane, Catherine De Sève and Sylvain Marcel.

=== Germany ===
A German version called &quot;Die Sketch Show&quot; has been on the air since 2003. It was produced by Brainpool for the TV channel ProSieben. Mack states in his autobiography that the show also utilised sketches that were written by the UK team but never recorded.

=== Greece ===
A sketch show called &quot;Skertsakia&quot; (, a play on Sketch and Scherzo) was broadcast during the 2006-2007 season, incorporated scripts from both seasons of the &quot;Sketch Show&quot; along with sketches from the Spanish comedy show &quot;Splunge!&quot;
It was wildly popular with young demographics and produced 30 episodes and a Christmas special. It was produced by TFG Lt. for ANT1.

=== Indonesia ===
An Indonesian version called &quot;Sketsa&quot; aired from 2008 to 2015 on Trans TV. Most sketches in this version are translations or adaptations of British sketches with little original material. The humour style remains faithful to the original. They only change the names and locations to Indonesian version.

=== Italy ===
An Italian version called &quot;Sketch Show&quot; has been on air since October 2010. The cast was principally made of Ale e Franz, two Italian famous comic actors. There were other actors and also live sketches, sometimes with famous guests.

===Mexico===
A Mexican version called &quot;Sketch Show Mexico&quot; has been on air since 2005.

=== Israel ===
An Israeli version called Ktsarim (, &quot;Shorts&quot;) broadcast on Channel 2, from 2004 to 2009.

<text>Prince Félix of Luxembourg, Prince of Bourbon-Parma and Prince of Nassau (Félix Léopold Marie Guillaume; born 3 June 1984) is the second son of Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. He is currently fourth in the line of succession to the throne of Luxembourg.

==Biography==
Prince Félix was born on 3 June 1984 in the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. He is the second of the five children of Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa, the others being: Hereditary Grand Duke Guillaume, Prince Louis, Princess Alexandra and Prince Sébastien. His godparents are Prince Jean and Catalina Mestre. He was named after his great-grandfather, Prince Felix of Bourbon-Parma.

Prince Félix attended primary school at Lorentzweiler before attending a private school for his secondary education called Notre Dame Sainte-Sophie of Luxembourg then at the American School of Luxembourg. In 1998, he went to the Swiss boarding school Collège Alpin International Beau Soleil in Villars-sur-Ollon. During his time at the boarding school, he would encounter his future spouse. In 2003, he graduated from secondary school with honours and joined the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom. However before graduating, he had to quit because of health reasons surrounding a knee injury.

Between 2003 and 2004, Prince Félix took interest in different fields of study such as political science, psychology and communication, leading him to attend schools in England and Belgium. He has also completed courses at various companies in order to obtain additional professional experience.

In 2005, Prince Félix joined the Marketing and Public Relations department of Grand Chelem Management SA, a Swiss company specializing in the organisation of sporting and cultural events. He continues to work as an independent consultant for the company. The prince takes a particular interest in ethics in biotechnology. In June 2009, the Grand Ducal Court announced later that October, Prince Félix would begin a bachelor&#x27;s degree in bioethics at the Pontifical Athenaeum Regina Apostolorum in Rome, Italy, completing it in 2013.

In 2013, the Prince married Claire Lademacher and together they have been managing Château Les Crostes - a wine estate in Lorgues in France - since October 2013. In 2016, he became the president of Lorgues Terre de Vins association, who have the goal of promoting the town as a tourist and wine destination. Also in 2016 Félix, Claire and some friends created the Young Empire company which is a clothing, furniture and homeware brand for children.

In addition to Luxembourgish, French, German, he is fluent in English and Italian. He has basic understanding in Spanish.

==Personal interests==
In 2003, he accepted the patronage of the sports association paratrooper &quot;Cercle Para Luxembourg&quot; (FAL). A fan of basketball, he was appointed honorary president of the &quot;Federation Luxembourg Basketball&quot; in 2005.

Since 2016, Prince Félix chairs the &quot;Lorgues Terre de Vins&quot; association, whose goal is to make their community an unmissable destination in Provence.

==Marriage and children==
On 13 December 2012, the Grand Ducal household confirmed Prince Félix&#x27;s engagement to Claire Lademacher. The civil wedding took place on 17 September 2013 in Königstein im Taunus, followed by a religious ceremony on 21 September in the Basilica of Sainte Marie-Madeleine in Saint-Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, France. Since the wedding, the couple have been living in the south of France at the &quot;Château Les Crostes&quot;, a winery in Lorgues that has been owned by the Lademacher family for many years.

Prince Félix and Princess Claire&#x27;s daughter, Princess Amalia Gabriela Maria Theresa, was born on 15 June 2014 at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg. A son, Prince Liam Henri Hartmut, was born at Beaulieu General Clinic in Geneva on 28 November 2016. Claire gave birth to their second son, Prince Balthazar Félix Karl of Nassau, on 7 January 2024 at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital in Luxembourg.

<text>Bahlul Ibn Marzuq () (died 802) was born in the current term of La Puebla de Castro (Huesca), was a Vascon-Muslim, the son of a local lord named Marzuq ibn Uskara (&quot;son of the Basque&quot;). He rebelled in Zaragoza against the Arab-Muslim government of Al-Andalus in 798, and in 800 conquered Huesca from the Banu Salama. His rebellion carried popular support, especially after public backing by theologian Ibn al-Mughallis. His exploits helped the Franks to conduct their siege and take Barcelona in 801. The emir sent the Huesca native, general Amrus ibn Yusuf, and Zaragoza and Huesca were retaken (c. 801). Bahlul fled to Pallars where he was killed by his lieutenant Jalaf Ibn Rashid (802), who at the time held Barbitanya (Barbastro). The adventures of Bhalul were collected by the Muslim historian and geographer Ahmad ibn Umar al-Udri (1003-1085) in the popular epic poem written in Arabic known as &quot;the archuza de Bahlul&quot;.

<doc id="1107584" wikidata="Q141236" url="?curid=1107584" title="Balantidium coli">
<text>Balantidium coli is a parasitic species of ciliate alveolates that causes the disease balantidiasis. It is the only member of the ciliate phylum known to be pathogenic to humans.

==Morphology==

&quot;Balantidium coli&quot; has two developmental stages, a trophozoite stage and a cyst stage. In trophozoites, the two nuclei are visible. The macronucleus is long and sausage-shaped, and the spherical micronucleus is nested next to it, often hidden by the macronucleus. The opening, known as the peristome, at the pointed anterior end leads to the cytostome, or the mouth. Cysts are smaller than trophozoites and are round and have a tough, heavy cyst wall made of one or two layers. Usually only the macronucleus and sometimes cilia and contractile vacuoles are visible in the cyst, however, both nuclei are present because nuclear multiplication does not occur when the organism is a cyst. Living trophozoites and cysts are yellowish or greenish in color.

==Transmission==
&quot;Balantidium&quot; is the only ciliated protozoan known to infect humans. Balantidiasis is a zoonotic disease and is acquired by humans via the feco-oral route from the normal host, the domestic pig, where it is asymptomatic. Contaminated water is the most common mechanism of transmission.

==Role in disease==
&quot;Balantidium coli&quot; lives in the cecum and colon of humans, pigs, rats, and other mammals. It is not readily transmissible from one species of host to another because it requires a period of time to adjust to the symbiotic flora of the new host. Once it has adapted to a host species, the protozoan can become a serious pathogen, especially in humans. Trophozoites multiply and encyst due to the dehydration of feces.

Infection occurs when the cysts are ingested, usually through contaminated food or water. &quot;B. coli&quot; infection in immunocompetent individuals is not unheard of, but it rarely causes serious disease of the gastrointestinal tract. It can thrive in the gastrointestinal tract as long as there is a balance between the protozoan and the host without causing dysenteric symptoms. Infection most likely occurs in people with malnutrition due to the low stomach acidity or people with compromised immune systems. In acute disease, explosive diarrhea may occur as often as every twenty minutes. Perforation of the colon may also occur in acute infections which can lead to life-threatening situations.

==Life cycle==
Infection occurs when a host ingests a cyst, which usually happens during the consumption of contaminated water or food. Once the first cyst is ingested, it passes through the host&#x27;s digestive system.
While the cyst receives some protection from degradation by the acidic environment of the stomach through the use of its outer wall, it is likely to be destroyed at a pH lower than 5, allowing it to survive easier in the stomachs of malnourished individuals who have less stomach acid. Once the cyst reaches the small intestine, trophozoites are produced. The trophozoites then colonize the large intestine, where they live in the lumen and feed on the intestinal flora. Some trophozoites invade the wall of the colon using proteolytic enzymes and multiply, and some of them return to the lumen. In the lumen, trophozoites may disintegrate or undergo encystation. Encystation is triggered by dehydration of the intestinal contents and usually occurs in the distal large intestine, but may also occur outside of the host in feces. Now in its mature cyst form, cysts are released into the environment where they can go on to infect a new host.

==Epidemiology==
Balantidiasis in humans is common in the Philippines, but it can be found anywhere in the world, especially among those that are in close contact with swine. The disease is considered to be rare and occurs in less than 1% of the human population. The disease poses a problem mostly in developing countries, where water sources may be contaminated with swine or human feces.

<doc id="1107589" wikidata="Q3436766" url="?curid=1107589" title="Robert and Thomas Wintour">
<text>Robert Wintour (1568 – 30 January 1606) and Thomas Wintour (1571 or 1572 – 31 January 1606), also spelt Winter, were members of the Gunpowder Plot, a failed conspiracy to assassinate King James I. They were brothers, and related to other conspirators, such as their cousin, Robert Catesby; a half-brother, John Wintour, also joined them following the plot&#x27;s failure. Thomas was an intelligent and educated man, fluent in several languages and trained as a lawyer, but chose instead to become a soldier, fighting for England in the Low Countries, France, and possibly in Central Europe. By 1600, however, he changed his mind and became a fervent Catholic. On several occasions he travelled to the continent and entreated Spain on behalf of England&#x27;s oppressed Catholics, and suggested that with Spanish support a Catholic rebellion was likely.

As momentum was building behind a peace settlement between the two countries, Thomas&#x27;s pleas fell on deaf ears. Instead, in 1604 he decided to join with Catesby, who planned to restore England to Catholicism by killing the king and inciting a popular revolt in the Midlands, during which James&#x27;s daughter, Princess Elizabeth, would be installed as titular queen. Thomas returned to the continent and again failed to elicit Spanish support, but instead met Guy Fawkes, with whom he returned to England. Robert, a devout Catholic who inherited Huddington Court near Worcester, joined the conspiracy the following year.

The plot began to unravel following the delivery of an anonymous letter to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, warning him to stay away from Parliament. Thomas and Catesby confronted Monteagle&#x27;s brother-in-law, the recently recruited Francis Tresham, threatening to kill him, but Tresham managed to convince them of his innocence. At that stage Thomas reportedly asked Catesby to abandon the scheme, to no avail. When Fawkes was captured at about midnight on 4 November 1605, Thomas fled to Robert&#x27;s house at Huddington in Worcestershire. Catesby and most of the others spent two days travelling across the Midlands attempting to incite a rebellion, but with an ever-diminishing group of supporters they eventually settled at Holbeche House in Staffordshire, and waited for government forces to arrive. Thomas, by then reintegrated into the group, chose to remain with them, and in the ensuing firefight was shot in the shoulder, and captured. Robert, who had left before the battle, evaded capture until January 1606.

Much of what is written about the plot is based on Thomas&#x27;s confessions, given in the Tower of London in November 1605. The brothers were tried on 27 January 1606, and hanged, drawn and quartered several days later in London.

==Family and life before 1604==
Robert (b. 1568) and Thomas Wintour (b. 1571–72) were sons of George Wintour of Huddington Court in Worcestershire, and his wife Jane (née Ingleby), daughter of Sir William Ingleby of Ripley Castle near Knaresborough. A sister, Dorothy, married another conspirator, John Grant. Two agnate half-siblings, John and Elizabeth, resulted from their father&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Bourn, following Jane&#x27;s death. Their paternal grandparents were Robert Wintour of Cavewell in Gloucestershire, and his wife Catherine, daughter of Sir George Throckmorton of Coughton in Warwickshire. As scions of the Throckmortons, they could therefore claim a kinship with plotters like Robert Catesby and Francis Tresham. Their maternal uncle Francis Ingleby, a Catholic priest, was hanged, drawn and quartered at York in 1586, a fact which, in the opinion of historian and author Antonia Fraser, &quot;could hardly have failed to leave a stark impression upon the Wintour family&quot;. The Wintours took their name from the Welsh Gwyn Tour (White Tower). &#x27;Wyntour&#x27; was sometimes used in signatures, but not &#x27;Winter&#x27; (as the brothers are commonly named).
Robert, a faithful Catholic, was married to Gertrude Talbot, daughter of the recusant John Talbot of Grafton. He inherited the Tudor Huddington Court near Worcester, along with a significant fortune with which he was known to be generous. Under Robert, Huddington Court became a known refuge for priests. The proclamation for his capture, issued following the plot&#x27;s failure, described him as &quot;a man of mean stature, and rather low than otherwise; square made, somewhat stooping; near 40 years of age; his hair and beard brown; his beard not much, and his hair short&quot;. The Jesuit John Gerard wrote that he was &quot;esteemed in his life to be one of the wisest and most resolute and sufficient gentlemen in Worcestershire&quot;. Gerard&#x27;s appraisal of Thomas was just as complimentary. He was apparently an intelligent, witty and educated man, who could speak Latin, Italian, Spanish and French. &quot;He was of mean stature, but strong and comely and very valiant, about 33 years old or somewhat more.&quot; Thomas worked as a servant to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle. He was educated as a lawyer, but following several years of dissipation travelled to Flanders and enrolled in the English army. He fought against Catholic Spain in the Low Countries, France, and possibly against the Turks in Central Europe. However, by 1600 his views had changed; citing his belief in the injustice of fighting against the power of Catholic Spain, like his elder brother he became a passionate Catholic. Travelling as &#x27;Mr Winter of Worcestershire&#x27;, from 24 February 1601 he spent 13 days in Rome for the jubilee, and later that year and into 1602 travelled to Spain, to petition the Council on behalf of the Catholic rebels left leaderless by the execution of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Father Henry Garnet, perhaps thinking that the purpose behind Thomas&#x27;s visit was to gain financial support for impoverished English Catholics, sent him to Superior Father Joseph Creswell, who made the introductions to the Spanish. This trip to Spain later became the first of two visits to be dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason, but Thomas&#x27;s timing was unfortunate, coming as it did so soon after Spain&#x27;s failed attack in Ireland, and he received only vague assurances of their support. In England he met with the Spanish embassy Don Juan de Tassis, who in August 1603 landed at Dover to help negotiate an Anglo-Spanish treaty. Tassis quickly realised that any chance of a successful Catholic rebellion was unlikely, and discounted Thomas&#x27;s claim that, with funding, &quot;3,000 Catholics&quot; would be available for the cause. After meeting with King James, he wrote to Spain emphasising the need to prioritise peace with England over the freedom of her Catholics.

==Thomas meets with Robert Catesby and John Wright==

According to contemporary accounts late in February 1604 Thomas&#x27;s cousin, Robert Catesby, invited him to his house in Lambeth, but Thomas was indisposed and could not attend. Catesby sent a second letter that Thomas did respond to, and when he arrived he found his cousin with John Wright, a devout Catholic and a renowned swordsman. Catesby planned to re-establish Catholicism in England by blowing up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament, killing the king. Thomas did not immediately recoil from the idea. As a former soldier he was a practical man, and he agreed with Catesby that should the plot succeed, it would &quot;breed a confusion fit to beget new alterations&quot;. He also offered a warning of the price of failure: &quot;the scandal would be so great which the Catholic religion might hereby sustain, as not only our enemies, but our friends also would with good reason condemn us.&quot; He nevertheless agreed to join the conspiracy, and as Catesby had not entirely given up hope of foreign support—&quot;because we will leave no peaceable and quiet way untried&quot;—Thomas returned to the continent.

In Flanders he met Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías and Constable of Castile, who was holding court there before his journey to England to conclude the Treaty of London. Thomas again stressed the plight of English Catholics, hoping to influence the forthcoming treaty negotiations due to take place at Somerset House in London. The Constable was &quot;friendly rather than forthcoming&quot;. Thomas also met the Welsh spy Hugh Owen, and Sir William Stanley, who were both disparaging of Catesby&#x27;s hopes of Spanish assistance. Owen did, however, introduce Thomas to Guy Fawkes, a committed Catholic who had served under Stanley as a soldier in the Southern Netherlands. Although at that time the plotters had no detailed plans, Thomas told Fawkes of their ambition to &quot;do somewhat in England&quot;, should Spanish support be lacking. In late April therefore the two men returned together to Catesby&#x27;s lodgings at Lambeth, and told him that despite positive noises from the Spanish, &quot;the deeds would nott answere&quot;.

==Robert joins==
With the addition to the conspiracy of Thomas Percy (John Wright&#x27;s brother-in-law), the five plotters met at the Duck and Drake inn, in the fashionable Strand district of London, on 20 May 1604. From hereon Thomas Wintour remained at the heart of the conspiracy. The group leased properties in London, one in Lambeth for storing the gunpowder that was rowed across the Thames to its destination. His confession has the plotters digging a tunnel toward their target during one of the several prorogations of Parliament, abandoned when the chamber directly beneath the House of Lords became available.

Following the meeting in May Catesby enlisted the aid of several more Catholic men, including Robert Wintour. On the same day he was admitted to the plot, 25 March 1605, the conspirators also purchased the lease to the undercroft they had supposedly tunnelled near. It was into this room that 36 barrels of gunpowder were brought, but when in late August Thomas and Fawkes made an inspection of the gunpowder, they found that it had decayed (separated). Thus, more gunpowder was brought in.

Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. The latter&#x27;s involvement in the plot has long been the subject of controversy, as on 26 October his brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, received an anonymous letter while at home, warning him to stay away from Parliament. Thomas went with Catesby to confront Tresham on the matter, threatening to &quot;hang him&quot; if he did not exonerate himself. Tresham managed to convince the pair that he was innocent, but Thomas then tried unsuccessfully to persuade Catesby to abandon the plot. His pleas were in vain; Catesby&#x27;s position was echoed by Percy, who at a meeting of the three in London on Sunday 3 November, said that he was ready to &quot;abide the uttermost trial&quot;. On the same day, Robert and three others stayed at the home of John Talbot of Grafton, his father-in-law. His friends were Robert Acton and his two sons, plus servants. The group left the following morning with extra horses supplied by Everard Digby, and travelled to Coventry.

==Failure and capture==
Monteagle had delivered the letter to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, and on Saturday 2 November (about a week later) the Privy Council decided to undertake a search of Parliament. The following Monday, during the first search, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, noticed the huge pile of faggots in the corner of the cellar beneath the House of Lords. The king insisted that another search be made, and about midnight another party, this time led by Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet, discovered Fawkes and arrested him.

News of Fawkes&#x27;s capture soon spread throughout London, including the Strand, where Christopher Wright, John Wright&#x27;s brother, overheard the commotion. He immediately went to Thomas, who was staying at the Duck and Drake inn. As Fawkes had given his name as &quot;John Johnson&quot;, servant of Percy, it was for the latter that the government&#x27;s first arrest warrant was issued. Thomas guessed as much, and told Wright to go to Percy and &quot;bid him begone&quot;. As the rest of those conspirators still in London fled the city, undaunted, he went over to Westminster to try and discern what he could. In author Alan Haynes&#x27;s opinion, this demonstrated an impressive degree of trust in Fawkes&#x27;s ability to confound his interrogators, but when Thomas heard for himself that the treason had been uncovered, he left for Huddington, stopping at his sister&#x27;s house in Norbrook along the way.

The fugitives reached Catesby&#x27;s family home of Ashby St Ledgers at about 6:00 pm. Not wanting to implicate his mother, Catesby sent a message to Robert, who had just recently arrived there, asking to meet just outside the town. There he told him that Fawkes had been captured. At Dunchurch they collected Everard Digby and his &#x27;hunting party&#x27;, which included Robert and Thomas&#x27;s half-brother, John Wintour. He had been invited to join them on 4 November. The next day the group raided Warwick Castle for supplies, something that Robert strongly objected to as it would create &quot;a great uproar&quot; in the country, and later arrived at Huddington Court, where they met Thomas. Early the next morning Huddington&#x27;s occupants went to confession and took the Sacrament at Mass—in Fraser&#x27;s opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. They collected further arms and munitions from Hewell Grange, but trying to recruit more people to their cause they were met with disdain; while the conspirators considered themselves to stand for &quot;God and country&quot;, the men of Hewell Grange replied that they were for &quot;King James as well as God and Country&quot;. Late that night, pulling a sodden cart full of weapons and armour behind them, they arrived at Holbeche House, near Kingswinford in Staffordshire. Robert was asked if he would go and see if he could elicit any help from his father-in-law, John Talbot at his mansion at &#x27;Pepperhill&#x27; in Boningale, Shropshire. He refused, and Thomas went instead, with Stephen Littleton. Talbot was, however, loyal to James, and sent them away, claiming that their visit was &quot;as much as his life was worth&quot;. While returning to Holbeche, they received a message that Catesby, Rookwood, John Grant and another man were dead, and the rest apparently fled. Tired and desperate, the plotters had attempted to dry their soaked gunpowder in front of the fire, only for a stray spark to ignite it. While Littleton chose to leave, begging his companion to follow his example, Thomas continued on to Holbeche, where he found the remaining plotters alive, but injured.

While several including Robert and his half-brother John chose to vanish into the night, Catesby, Percy, the Wright brothers, Grant, Rookwood and Thomas remained. Thomas asked them what they intended to do – &quot;We mean here to die&quot;. Thomas replied &quot;I will take such part as you do&quot;. Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, arrived with a vigilante force of about 200 men early on 8 November. Thomas was the first to be hit, in the shoulder, while crossing the courtyard. The Wright brothers were next, followed by Rookwood, still injured from the explosion the night before. Catesby and Percy were dropped by a single lucky shot. The sheriff&#x27;s men then proceeded to strip the defenders of their valuables, but Thomas was saved by the sheriff&#x27;s assistant. His fine sword, ordered and paid for four months previously, apparently proved too great a temptation for the Sheriff&#x27;s men, as it was never seen again. He and the others were taken first to Worcester, and then to the Tower of London. Despite a proclamation of 18 November naming them as wanted men, Robert Wintour and Stephen Litteton managed to evade capture until 9 January 1606. They spent about two months hiding out in barns and houses; at one point they were forced to restrain a drunken poacher who happened upon their hiding place. They were eventually discovered at the house of Humphrey Littleton in Hagley, after a cook, John Finwood, informed on them. Humphrey managed to escape, but was captured at Prestwood, in Staffordshire.

==Thomas&#x27;s confession==
Historically, much of what is written about the Gunpowder Plot is derived from Thomas&#x27;s confession, signed on 23 November 1605; details of the so-called Spanish Treason were added three days later. One of only two confessions printed in the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot; (a highly partial contemporary account of the affair), Thomas Wintour&#x27;s was the only account the government had of a plotter who had been involved from the beginning; Guy Fawkes, weakened by days of torture, may have been at the heart of the group, but he was not at its first meetings. However, Antonia Fraser views the document with suspicion, not least because Thomas&#x27;s signature, &#x27;Thomas Winter&#x27;, differs from his normal signature, &#x27;Thomas Wintour&#x27; (it was the former that was invariably used by the government). The signature, possibly forged by lieutenant of the Tower of London William Waad, was made only weeks after Thomas had been shot in the shoulder during the siege at Holbeche House. Biographer Mark Nicholls views the difference in signatures as a significant and puzzling lapse, if a &quot;master forger&quot; is presumed to be responsible for the document. He views the handwriting on the confession as &quot;convincingly that of Winter [Wintour]&quot;, pointing out that it appears to be the work of an author, not an editor, and written as a draft for the &quot;King&#x27;s Book&quot;. This is a view that generally, Alan Haynes agrees with: &quot;no one has ever made a solid and sensible suggestion about why a government-employed forger (say Thomas Phelippes) would deliberately make such an error in a crucial state document&quot;.

Another of Fraser&#x27;s concerns is Waad&#x27;s report to Salisbury on 21 November: &quot;Thomas Winter doth find his hand so strong as after dinner he will settle himself to write that he hath verbally declared to your Lordship adding what he shall remember&quot;—or rather, what he was told to remember. A draft of Thomas&#x27;s confession, in Coke&#x27;s handwriting, places extra weight on the involvement of the Jesuits. Thomas&#x27;s confession also details his account of the mine supposedly dug toward Parliament, not mentioned in Fawkes&#x27;s first confession.

==Trial and death==

The trial of the eight surviving conspirators began on Monday 27 January. The two brothers were brought with the other plotters by barge from the Tower (Catebsy&#x27;s servant, Thomas Bates, arrived from the Gatehouse Prison), to Whitehall. They were kept in Star Chamber, before being led into Westminster Hall. Charged with high treason, and with no defence counsel, the outcome was never in doubt. The Spanish Treason was a feature of Attorney General Edward Coke&#x27;s rhetoric, although the Spanish king was &quot;reverently and respectfully spoken of&quot;. The Jesuits, such as Henry Garnet, were condemned. Each of the brothers&#x27; confessions were also read aloud. While in the Tower, Robert and Fawkes had shared adjacent cells, and were able to speak to each other. However, their private conversation was secretly recorded, and read aloud during the trial.

When asked if he had anything to say, &quot;wherefore judgement of death should not be pronounced&quot;, Thomas spoke of his regret at having introduced Robert to the plot, and asked to be hanged on his behalf as well as his own. Robert merely begged for mercy. At the end of the trial, the jury pronounced them all guilty of high treason.

Everard Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were executed on Thursday 30 January 1606. Dragged by horse to Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Robert was the second to be executed, praying quietly to himself before he was hanged, drawn and quartered. The following morning, the remaining four were dragged to the Old Palace Yard at Westminster, opposite the building they had planned to destroy. Thomas was the first to mount the scaffold. It was customary to grant the condemned a speech, but Thomas, &quot;a very pale and dead colour&quot;, said it was &quot;no time to discourse: he was come to die&quot;. He absolved the Jesuits of any involvement in the plot, asked for Catholics to pray for him, and declared his adherence to the Roman religion. He was hanged for only a few seconds, and then taken to the block for the remainder of his grim sentence. Their half-brother John was executed at Red Hill near Worcester, on 7 April.

<doc id="1107590" wikidata="Q618634" url="?curid=1107590" title="Prince Louis of Luxembourg">
<text>Prince Louis of Luxembourg, Prince of Bourbon-Parma and Prince of Nassau (Louis Xavier Marie Guillaume; born 3 August 1986) is the third son of Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Maria Teresa, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg.

Louis has two elder siblings, Guillaume and Felix; and two younger siblings, Alexandra and Sébastien. He was married to Tessy Antony, a former NCO in the Luxembourg Army, whom he divorced in 2019.

==Early life and education==
After spending two years in the United States, where Louis underwent training in &quot;Aeronautics and Aeronautical Management&quot; and gained his &quot;Private pilot certificate&quot;, the princely family moved to the United Kingdom. There, he attended university. In May 2014, he graduated from Richmond, The American International University in London with a BA degree in Art in Communications. He wrote his undergraduate dissertation on humanitarian advertisement. He then continued his study at Birkbeck College in London and obtained an MA degree in Psychosocial Studies in 2017.

At the International Forum on Learning Disabilities, held on 30 January 2016 in Luxembourg, Louis spoke for the first time in public about his struggle with dyslexia. He was diagnosed at the age of 10. He said of his learning difficulty, &quot;I did not understand what was happening. I was constantly forced to try to achieve the same levels as others. That takes a lot of time and leaves you frustrated because you can&#x27;t do it.&quot; He also said that he used sports, especially rugby, as an outlet for his frustration.

==Marriage and family==
On 12 March 2006, Tessy Antony gave birth to a boy, named Gabriel Michael Louis Ronny de Nassau, who was born at a private Swiss hospital, Clinic des Grangettes, in Geneva. Their son was the first grandchild of Grand Duke Henri and Grand Duchess Maria Teresa.

Louis married Antony on 29 September 2006 in Gilsdorf&#x27;s Catholic parish church. Upon his initially morganatic marriage, he gave up his succession rights and those of all the couple&#x27;s children. Although he retained his title of &quot;Prince of Luxembourg&quot; and the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, his wife and son were originally only given the surname &quot;de Nassau&quot; with no titles. The couple&#x27;s second son, Noah Etienne Guillaume Gabriel Matthias Xavier de Nassau, was born on 21 September 2007 at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Maternity Hospital. The baby was baptised at the same church in Gilsdorf where his parents married and his elder brother was baptised.

On Luxembourg&#x27;s National Day on 23 June 2009, Tessy was given the title of &quot;Princess of Luxembourg&quot; and the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. Their sons and future children were also given the title &quot;Prince of Nassau&quot; with the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;. The family lived in London.

The Grand Ducal Court announced the separation of Louis and Tessy on 18 January 2017. Divorce proceedings began in the United Kingdom, where the couple lived. The divorce was finalized on 4 April 2019.

On 6 April 2021, the Grand Ducal Court announced the engagement of Prince Louis to Scarlett-Lauren Sirgue (born on 8 August 1991 in Bordeaux). She is the daughter of Pierre Sirgue, a lawyer and former member of the French National Assembly for National Front (a far-right political party), and Scarlett Berrebi, a lawyer. On 22 February 2022, it was announced that Prince Louis and Scarlett-Lauren had called off the engagement.

== Patronage ==
Louis is a patron of the Luxembourg Federation of Table Tennis (since 2004), the Martial Arts Federation (since 2010), and the Luxembourg Aeronautical Federation (since 2011).

==Honours and awards==
** Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau
** Grand Cross of Order of Adolphe of Nassau

<doc id="1107592" wikidata="Q3405168" url="?curid=1107592" title="Mynachlog-ddu">
<text>Mynachlog-ddu () is a village, parish and community in the Preseli Hills, Pembrokeshire, Wales. The community includes the parish of Llangolman.

==Origin of the name==
The Welsh placename means &quot;black monastic grange&quot;: before the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the parish belonged to St Dogmaels Abbey.

==Geography==
Mynachlog-ddu sits on a plateau above sea level between Carn Menyn () and Foel Dyrch () in the Preseli Hills.

==History==
Mynachlog-ddu and the surrounding Preselis are rich in prehistoric remains. It is one of the possible sites of the Battle of Mynydd Carn in 1081. By c.1100 it was under the control of the Normans. Much has been unenclosed moorland since the Middle Ages, with few houses. The village developed as housing for slate quarry workers and there has been a chapel in the village since 1794.

The population of the parish in 1821 was 447.
Carn Menyn is presumed to be the source of the bluestones used in the inner circle of Stonehenge. In 2000/2001 a project was established to try to transport a piece of bluestone from the village to Stonehenge. The project ended when the stone sank in the sea. It was lifted out a few months after, but the project was never resumed. A comedy based on the idea of a campaign to have the bluestones returned Bringing Back the Bluestones premiered in Pembrokeshire.

There are six listed structures in the community.

==Worship==
There are two places of worship in the village: the Anglican church (Church in Wales) of St Dogfael (sometimes, Dogmael), and Bethel, the Baptist meeting house.

==Notable people==
* The poet Waldo Williams (1904–1971) was a pupil at the primary school (where his father was headteacher) between 1911 and 1915, where he learned to speak Welsh. There is a memorial to him at nearby Rhos Fach.
* Dutch naval officer and Colditz prisoner of war camp escapee Damiaen Joan van Doorninck (1902–1987) spent his retirement in Mynachlogddu and died there.

<doc id="1107594" wikidata="Q7558165" url="?curid=1107594" title="Solipsis">
<text>Solipsis is a free and open-source system for a massively multi-participant shared virtual world designed by Joaquin Keller and Gwendal Simon at France Télécom Research and Development Labs. It aims to provide the infrastructure for a metaverse-like public virtual territory. Relying on peer-to-peer architecture, the virtual world may potentially be inhabited by a theoretically unlimited number of participants.

==Motivations==
A central objective of Solipsis is to create a virtual world which is as independent as possible from the influence of private interests, such as server ownership. In order to achieve this, it is based around a peer-to-peer model rather than the traditional server-client one. Additionally, it aims to give users more flexibility in designing interfaces and content in their individual segments of the virtual world.

==Main principles==
A Solipsis entity is a basic element of the virtual world. To exist, an entity should run a &quot;node&quot; that may be controlled by a &quot;navigator&quot;. Nodes are self-organized in a pure peer-to-peer network, in which relationships depend on virtual proximity. A navigator is mainly a graphical user interface, but some communication services may be added to one for interaction between entities.

The virtual world is initially empty and is only filled by entities run by end users&#x27; computers. All Solipsis nodes are functionally equal, and no preordained infrastructure is required. This eliminates as far as possible any restrictions on the content or functionality of the world.

==Current status==
Solipsis currently consists of:
*A peer-to-peer protocol over UDP. The Solipsis protocol gives a node the ability to broadcast its presence within the virtual world. Moreover, this protocol aims to guarantee the maintenance of some global properties.
*A node-navigator interface, which takes the form of an API between the node and the navigator. Currently written in XML-RPC, this interface allows a navigator to control a node and to retrieve information on its virtual surroundings.
*A basic implementation of a Solipsis node and a Solipsis navigator licensed under the LGPL. The navigator features a two-dimensional representation of the virtual world. The design of current interface resembles YackPack, an interactive system developed by the company of the same name, by a team of engineers in Santa Rosa, led by Chief Technology Officer David Levine and envisioned by Professor BJ Fogg of Stanford University. Interaction between entities consists only of chat.
*Some other services, which implement blogs, some identity fields for social networking, file sharing, and graphical chat.

<doc id="1107596" wikidata="Q2071054" url="?curid=1107596" title="Linear approximation">
<text>In mathematics, a linear approximation is an approximation of a general function using a linear function (more precisely, an affine function). They are widely used in the method of finite differences to produce first order methods for solving or approximating solutions to equations.

==Definition==
Given a twice continuously differentiable function formula_1 of one real variable, Taylor&#x27;s theorem for the case formula_2 states that
formula_3
where formula_4 is the remainder term. The linear approximation is obtained by dropping the remainder:
formula_5

This is a good approximation when formula_6 is close enough to since a curve, when closely observed, will begin to resemble a straight line. Therefore, the expression on the right-hand side is just the equation for the tangent line to the graph of formula_1 at formula_8. For this reason, this process is also called the tangent line approximation. Linear approximations in this case are further improved when the second derivative of a, formula_9, is sufficiently small (close to zero) (i.e., at or near an inflection point).

If formula_1 is concave down in the interval between formula_6 and formula_12, the approximation will be an overestimate (since the derivative is decreasing in that interval). If formula_1 is concave up, the approximation will be an underestimate.

Linear approximations for vector functions of a vector variable are obtained in the same way, with the derivative at a point replaced by the Jacobian matrix. For example, given a differentiable function formula_14 with real values, one can approximate formula_14 for formula_16 close to formula_17 by the formula 
formula_18

The right-hand side is the equation of the plane tangent to the graph of formula_19 at formula_20

In the more general case of Banach spaces, one has
formula_21
where formula_22 is the Fréchet derivative of formula_1 at formula_12.

==Applications==

===Optics===

&quot;Gaussian optics&quot; is a technique in geometrical optics that describes the behaviour of light rays in optical systems by using the paraxial approximation, in which only rays which make small angles with the optical axis of the system are considered. In this approximation, trigonometric functions can be expressed as linear functions of the angles. Gaussian optics applies to systems in which all the optical surfaces are either flat or are portions of a sphere. In this case, simple explicit formulae can be given for parameters of an imaging system such as focal distance, magnification and brightness, in terms of the geometrical shapes and material properties of the constituent elements.

===Period of oscillation===

The period of swing of a simple gravity pendulum depends on its length, the local strength of gravity, and to a small extent on the maximum angle that the pendulum swings away from vertical, , called the amplitude. It is independent of the mass of the bob. The true period &quot;T&quot; of a simple pendulum, the time taken for a complete cycle of an ideal simple gravity pendulum, can be written in several different forms (see pendulum), one example being the infinite series:
formula_25

where L is the length of the pendulum and g is the local acceleration of gravity.

However, if one takes the linear approximation (i.e. if the amplitude is limited to small swings, ) the period is:
In the linear approximation, the period of swing is approximately the same for different size swings: that is, &quot;the period is independent of amplitude&quot;. This property, called isochronism, is the reason pendulums are so useful for timekeeping. Successive swings of the pendulum, even if changing in amplitude, take the same amount of time.

===Electrical resistivity===

The electrical resistivity of most materials changes with temperature. If the temperature &quot;T&quot; does not vary too much, a linear approximation is typically used:
formula_26
where formula_27 is called the &quot;temperature coefficient of resistivity&quot;, formula_28 is a fixed reference temperature (usually room temperature), and formula_29 is the resistivity at temperature formula_28. The parameter formula_27 is an empirical parameter fitted from measurement data. Because the linear approximation is only an approximation, formula_27 is different for different reference temperatures. For this reason it is usual to specify the temperature that formula_27 was measured at with a suffix, such as formula_34, and the relationship only holds in a range of temperatures around the reference. When the temperature varies over a large temperature range, the linear approximation is inadequate and a more detailed analysis and understanding should be used.

<doc id="1107597" wikidata="Q5579287" url="?curid=1107597" title="Golden Cockerel Press">
<text>The Golden Cockerel Press was an English fine press operating between 1920 and 1961.

== History ==
The private press made handmade limited editions of classic works. The type was hand-set and the books were printed on handmade paper, and sometimes on vellum. A feature of Golden Cockerel books was the original illustrations, usually wood engravings, contributed by artists including Eric Gill, Robert Gibbings, Peter Claude Vaudrey Barker-Mill, John Buckland Wright, Blair Hughes-Stanton, Agnes Miller Parker, David Jones, Mark Severin, Dorothea Braby, Lettice Sandford, Gwenda Morgan, Mary Elizabeth Groom and Eric Ravilious.

==Hal Taylor&#x27;s foundation (1920–1924)==
The Golden Cockerel Press was founded by Harold (Hal) Midgley Taylor (1893–1925) in 1920 and was first in Waltham St Lawrence in Berkshire where he had unsuccessfully tried fruit farming. Taylor bought an army surplus hut and assembled it in Waltham St Lawrence as a combined workshop and living quarters. The Press was set up as a cooperative with four partners, Hal Taylor, Barbara Blackburn, Pran Pyper, and Ethelwynne (Gay) Stewart McDowall. In April 1920 Hal Taylor and Gay McDowall had married. The four initially lived at Taylor&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house in Beaconsfield and cycled daily to the hut in Waltham St Lawrence. It was Taylor who persuaded his family trust to provide most of the capital (approximately £2,800) for printing presses et al.

Their first prospectus proclaimed: &quot;This press is a co-operative society for the printing and publishing of books. It is co-operative in the strictest sense. Its members are their own craftsmen, and will produce their books themselves in their own communal workshops without recourse to paid and irresponsible labour&quot;. Their first publications were &quot;The Voices&quot;, a literary review, and &quot;Adam &amp; Eve &amp; Pinch Me&quot;, short stories by a new author, A. E. Coppard, which was a critical success and sold well. Unfortunately the mood of idealism of the first prospectus did not last long. Proof-reading, for example, had been poor, which upset the authors. By summer 1921 Blackburn and Pyper had left and the co-operative became a more conventional private press when Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs were employed. In 1923 the press published &quot;The Wedding Songs of Spenser&quot; with colour wood engravings by Ethelbert White, the first illustrated book from the press and a foretaste of editions to come.
When Hal Taylor suffered a recurrent bout of tuberculosis, Coppard took charge as a temporary manager. But then with Taylor&#x27;s continued decline the business was put up for sale, early in 1924.

==Robert Gibbings period (1924–1933)==
Robert Gibbings was working on wood engravings for &quot;The Lives of Gallant Ladies&quot; at the time the press was put up for sale, and, to secure publication of this work, he sought a loan from a friend, Hubert Pike, a director of Bentley Motors, to buy the press. He took over in February 1924, paying £850 for the huts housing the business, the plant and goodwill. For the partially completed &quot;Gallant Ladies&quot; a further sum of £200 was paid. He also leased the house and land for £40 per annum. &quot;Gallant Ladies&quot; sold well with receipts of over £1,800, and saw the start of a golden period for the press.

The printing staff – Frank Young, Albert Cooper and Harry Gibbs – were skilled and capable of very fine work. Moira Gibbings helped her husband in the business, and Gibbings kept close links with Coppard. Gibbings knew all the leading wood engravers of the day (he was a founder member and leading light of the Society of Wood Engravers) and a number of authors, which enabled him to publish modern texts as well as classic ones.

The first book for which Gibbings was entirely responsible was &quot;Moral Maxims&quot; by Rochefoucault (1924). Eric Gill was brought into the fold when he quarrelled with Hilary Pepler over the publication of Enid Clay&#x27;s &quot;Sonnets and Verses&quot; (1925) and transferred the book to Gibbings. In 1925 he went on to commission engravings from John Nash, Noel Rooke, David Jones, John Farleigh and Mabel Annesley among others.

Gibbings published some 71 titles at the press and printed a number of books for others. The size of a run was normally between 250 and 750, and the books were mostly bound in leather by bookbinders Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe. The major titles were the four volume &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (1929 to 1931) and the &quot;Four Gospels&quot; (1931), both illustrated by Gill. Gibbings printed 15 copies of the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; on vellum, and 12 copies of the &quot;Four Gospels&quot;. Printing the &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; dominated work at the press for two and a half years, and relatively few other books were printed during that period. However, the book was a considerable critical and financial success and grossed £14,000.

1931 saw the first appearance of the Golden Cockerel typeface, designed especially for the press by Gill. Its first use was in A. E. Coppard″s &quot;The Hundredth Story&quot;.

The illustrations in some Golden Cockerel titles, although tame by modern standards, were considered &quot;risqué&quot; for the time and necessitated the press taking precautionary measures against possible prosecutions for obscenity or provocation, such as disguising the names of translators and illustrators. &quot;Gallant Ladies&quot; was mild in comparison with the &quot;Song of Songs&quot; (1925) and &quot;Procreant Hymn&quot; (1926), both illustrated fairly explicitly by Gill. The main defence of the press was that it was a &quot;private&quot; press, not a bookseller.

Sales were strong during most of this period. Gibbings had established links with a number of booksellers, notably Bumpus in London, and negotiated a very favourable deal with Random House. He bought out Pike with finance from another Irish friend, Mary Wiggin, and later bought her out, borrowing the money from Barclays Bank.

In the early 1930s, however, the business climate changed, and, as American sales faltered, the press struggled on as the depression became more severe. The press became moribund and Gibbings eventually sold up in 1933. The last book that he produced was &quot;Lord Adrian&quot; by Lord Dunsany (1933), illustrated with his own wood engravings.

==Christopher Sandford period (1933–1959)==

The press was taken over by Christopher Sandford, Owen Rutter, and Francis J. Newbery. They paid £1,050 for the business. Gibbings had been in negotiations with Sandford for some time, and had introduced Rutter to him. Newbery was the manager of the Chiswick Press, where production was to be moved. The Golden Cockerel Press ceased to be a private press at this point, and became a publishing house. Sandford worked long hours on management, editing and design. Rutter solicited new books and edited some of them. Newbery&#x27;s role as the printer was to oversee the production work at the Chiswick Press.

The first book published under the new regime was &quot;The House with the Apricot&quot; (1933) by H. E. Bates. It featured wood engravings by Agnes Miller Parker and had been planned by Gibbings. The first major book of the new regime was &quot;The Glory of Life&quot; (1934) by Llewelyn Powys, a large quarto with wood engravings by Gibbings.

The partners lost money on most of the books that they published, a fact that they had recognised when they bought the press. They were looking to the long term, and tried a number of strategies to strengthen their position, including offering to buy the Gregynog Press so that they could close it down and reduce the competition. The partners had to advance money from their private accounts to keep the press solvent. There had been tension between the three for some time and Anthony Sandford replaced Newbery as a partner. He had a much more commercial approach than his brother Christopher and Rutter, and expected a return on his investment. The press started to produce unlimited editions aimed at the Christmas market, but these too failed in terms of commercial success. Rutter wrote to Christopher Sandford: &quot;We are publishing edition after edition of which more than half remains as stock&quot;. Anthony Sandford left as a partner in 1938.

In spite of all the problems caused by the advent of the Second World War there was one huge benefit for the press. People wanted books to read and by 1943 most of the Golden Cockerel stock, a growing liability, had been sold. In 1944 Rutter died but Sandford decided to carry on on his own; he had no financial need to seek a new partner, since the Chiswick Press, in which he had been a major shareholder, had been sold.

Sandford introduced colour illustrations, anathema to private press purists, and other means of reproducing illustrations instead of using original wood engravings – lithography and colour collotype.

Some 120 works were published during the Sandford era. One favourite illustrator was John Buckland Wright, another Clifford Webb, from whom he commissioned wood engravings for eight books. Sandford also commissioned Lettice Sandford, his wife, and artist Dorothea Braby, to work on multiple books produced by the press.


==Thomas Yoseloff period (1959–1961)==

In 1959 Sandford, for whom the financial pressures of keeping the press going had become too much, sold the publishing business to Thomas Yoseloff, an American publisher and at the time director of University of Pennsylvania Press. Yoseloff completed the publication of two titles in 1960 that had been previously commissioned by Sandford, a translation by David Gwyn Williams of the poem &quot;In Defence of Woman&quot; (&quot;O Blaid Y Gwragedd&quot;) by the 16th century Welsh poet William Cynwal, illustrated by John Petts, and &quot;Poems and Sonnets of Shakespeare&quot;, edited by Gwyn Jones and illustrated by Buckland Wright. The following year, two more titles were issued under Yoseloff&#x27;s direction, &quot;Folk Tales and Fairy Stories from India&quot; by Sudhin Ghose, and &quot;Moncrif&#x27;s Cats&quot;, a translation by Reginald Bretnor of the 18th century French writer François-Augustin Paradis de Moncrif″s 1727 work, &quot;Histoire des chats&quot;.

These were to be the last two Golden Cockerel Press titles to be published, however, as the continuation of the business soon proved impractical. By the end of 1961 Yoseloff wound up operations, as the resources and fine bookcraft skills necessary for production of Golden Cockerel titles had become too difficult and costly to obtain.

<text>DeShaun Dupree Holton (October 2, 1973 – April 11, 2006), known professionally as Proof, was an American rapper from Detroit, Michigan. During his career, he was a member of the groups 5 Elementz, Funky Cowboys, Promatic, Goon Sqwad, and D12. He was a close childhood friend of rapper Eminem, who also lived in Detroit. Proof was often a hype man rapper at Eminem&#x27;s concerts.

== Early life ==
Holton was born to Sharallene &quot;Pepper&quot; Holton, a single mother. His father, McKinley Jackson, was a music producer who left to pursue his career prior to Holton&#x27;s birth. Holton was close friends with Eminem from a young age.
== Career ==
Originally known as Maximum, under the &quot;Proof&quot;, Holton first rose to national prominence when he formed D12, &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;, in 1996 with his friends Eminem, Bizarre, Mr. Porter, and a high school friend Eye-Kyu. Shortly after that, Proof recruited two friends, B-Flat &amp; Dirty Ratt, to the group. This created the first lineup of Proof&#x27;s supergroup D12. Eventually this first incarnation of the group ended back in early 1996 because the original members of D12, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat, and Dirty Ratt, were more focused on recording music with their other groups. Bizarre, Denaun, and Eminem, could not make it to the studio sessions because they were also working with their other groups. Proof decided to break up this version of the group in 1996.

Proof later reformed the group in mid-1996. This time Proof called Bizarre and Eminem, since they were available. He also asked Denaun, who said he would not return to the group unless they recruit an affiliate and friend of the group, Kuniva. Proof allowed Denaun to put Kuniva in the group since all the members at the time were already friends with Kuniva. Then Bizarre decided one of Proof&#x27;s friends, who was a rapper (from 6th Mile, Detroit) named MC Bugz, should be in the group. Bugz was also a childhood friend of B-Flat and Dirty Ratt, who had previously parted ways with D12. Early individual accomplishments included being featured in &quot;The Source&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; column in 1999 and nearly winning the 1998 Blaze Battle. His first television appearance was in the video for Aaliyah&#x27;s &quot;Age Ain&#x27;t Nothing But a Number&quot;.

In 2000, Proof toured with Eminem, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Snoop Dogg in the Up In Smoke Tour, performing as a hype man for Eminem. He gained further exposure in 2001 with the release of &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;, D12&#x27;s debut album on Interscope Records. The following year, Proof collaborated with Dogmatic on their joint album &quot;Promatic&quot; which received positive reviews. He also joined Eminem&#x27;s &quot;Anger Management&quot; tour in support of the release. He appeared in the film &quot;8 Mile&quot; along with Eminem and Xzibit. Proof appeared as Lil&#x27; Tic, a freestyle rapper who rap battles the main character, B-Rabbit, played by Eminem. To capitalize on the publicity from the film, Proof released a six-song EP called &quot;Electric CoolAid Acid Testing&quot;. Proof also starred in a cameo role, alongside the rest of D12 (except for Eminem), in &quot;The Longest Yard&quot;, appearing as &quot;Basketball Convicts&quot; during the credits.

=== Solo work ===
Proof released a solo album featuring collaborations with 50 Cent, Method Man, Nate Dogg, B-Real of Cypress Hill, T3 of Slum Village, Obie Trice, King Gordy, Eminem and D12. Proof said that he did not produce the record with Shady Records or Aftermath because he wanted to &quot;build his own thing&quot;. Called &quot;Searching for Jerry Garcia&quot;, the album was released on August 9, 2005, on his own Iron Fist Records label in conjunction with Alliance Entertainment&#x27;s IDN Distribution, ten years to the day following Grateful Dead frontman Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death. It contained the prophetic song &quot;Kurt Kobain&quot; in which he wrote of his own death and &quot;passing the sign&quot; to 1st Born as his protégé once he was gone. Proof has said that he considered Garcia to be a &quot;genius&quot; who suffered from common character flaws. Proof has stated his admiration for Garcia&#x27;s eclectic style, saying that Garcia &quot;went against the grain&quot;. Proof stated how he wanted to be remembered in an interview with SOHH.com shortly after his album release: &quot;I want people to say that I was a true artist, that I did it best and stayed true to Hip Hop roots [...] I&#x27;d want people to understand I did it for the love, not for the charts.&quot; The album received favorable reviews, which commented on its &quot;eclectic&quot; and &quot;introspective&quot; nature. Despite its list of guest appearances and favorable reviews, the release did not make a significant impact on the charts.
Proof also recorded a track, &quot;How I Live,&quot; with Twiztid for their album &quot;Independents Day&quot; shortly before his death. Besides these, he recorded during his Gold Coast tour in 2006, which was exactly two weeks before his death, a song with &quot;Liquidsilva&quot; from Australia.

At the time of Proof&#x27;s death, he wrote and recorded what would have been his third album called &quot;Time a Tell&quot; with DJ Jewels Baby in a span of 24 hours. The album was later released on DatPiff in 2010 as a mixtape.

== Shooting and death ==
On April 11, 2006, Holton was shot to death after a dispute broke out during a game of billiards at the CCC Club on 8 Mile Road in Detroit. A pool game between Holton and Keith L. Bender Jr. turned into a heated argument and then escalated into a physical altercation, during which club bouncer Mario Etheridge, who was Bender&#x27;s cousin, fired a warning shot into the air. There have been many conflicting reports about Holton and Bender&#x27;s roles in the shooting, but it was reported that Holton then shot Bender in the head during the altercation. Bender was not immediately killed by the gunshot but died a week later from his injuries. Etheridge responded by shooting Holton three times, once in the head and twice in the chest, killing him at the scene. At the time of his death, Holton&#x27;s blood alcohol content was 0.32. His lawyer, David Gorosh, accused police and the media of being &quot;reckless&quot; for suggesting that his client fired the first shots without having any hard evidence. A few weeks after both men&#x27;s deaths, Bender&#x27;s family filed a wrongful death claim against Holton&#x27;s estate. Authorities determined that Etheridge was acting lawfully in defense of another; however, he was found guilty of carrying a concealed weapon and discharging a firearm inside a building.

On April 19, 2006, a service for Holton was held in the Fellowship Chapel in Detroit to a full house of 2,660 people, including his friends Eminem, Royce Da 5&#x27;9”, 50 Cent, and thousands more mourning outside. He was then buried in Woodlawn Cemetery.

=== Alternate account ===
Seven months after Holton&#x27;s death, his close friend Reginald &quot;Mudd&quot; Moore, who was with him at the nightclub, gave an exclusive interview with &quot;XXL&quot; magazine where he told a different account of what happened that night. In Moore&#x27;s version of the events, the night started out with him and Holton and two of their friends barhopping. They arrived at the club at around 3:00a.m., where the fight between Bender and Holton broke out over a pool game. Etheridge fired two shots into the air to break up the fight, but instead the shots caused panic. Moore then claimed that an intoxicated Holton pushed him out of the way, reached for his own gun and fired once into the air. Bender then attacked Holton from behind in attempt to free the weapon from his grasp, and Etheridge then opened fire in the direction of Holton and Bender, killing both men.

=== Legacy ===
In 2008, Welsh singer/songwriter Jem dedicated the song &quot;You Will Make It&quot; to Holton&#x27;s memory on her second album &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. In the liner notes, she said &quot;For your families and friends and for all those who experienced the tragedy of sudden loss&quot;. In early 2009, Jem revealed &quot;The track is about losing someone and I wrote it the day after his friend Proof was murdered. I was in Detroit with Eminem&#x27;s friends, who I happened to be recording with, when it happened&quot;. Eminem eulogized his friend with the unreleased track &quot;Difficult&quot;, which leaked to the public in 2010. Eminem further eulogized Proof on &quot;Recovery&quot; with &quot;You&#x27;re Never Over&quot;.

<text>Sullivans Cove is on the River Derwent adjacent to the Hobart City Centre in Tasmania.
It was the site of initial European settlement in the area, and the location of the earlier components of the Port of Hobart.

==History==
The cove was the initial landing site of what is now the city of Hobart. It was founded on 21 February 1804 by Lieutenant Governor David Collins, who travelled to the shore via what was then a rocky island named Hunter Island. The connection to the shore was developed and is now known as Hunter Street. The island now has a building directly above it.

Although the first European settlement in the state was further up the river at Risdon Cove by John Bowen a year earlier, that settlement was abandoned and relocated to join the Sullivans Cove settlers.

Collins named Sullivans Cove after John Sullivan, Permanent Under Secretary to the Colonies.
By 1916, several piers had been constructed: from north to south:
*Ocean Pier (built 1914)
*Queens Pier (originally Alexandra Pier, renamed in 1910)
*Kings Pier (built 1910)
*Argyle Street Pier (built 1875)
*Elizabeth Street Pier (built 1866)
*Franklin Pier
*Brooke Street Pier (built 1820s, renovated 1879).
*Ferry Pier

In 1933, the Argyle Street and Elizabeth Street Piers were replaced with a single concrete-reinforced structure at Elizabeth Street Pier.

In 1947 there was a proposal to replace Queens and Kings Pier with an extra wide pier, but this was never realised.

In 1948, Ocean Pier was destroyed by a fire.

Kings Pier was demolished and replaced with a marina for commercial and private craft, around 1970. This marina increased in size in 2003.

==Current==
Sullivans Cove holds large historical and sentimental value for the city. The cove area itself is now known as Macquarie Wharf and serves as the main port for the city. Many of the original buildings along the esplanade are still standing.

The University of Tasmania&#x27;s School of the Arts building is based on Hunter Street.

A serviced apartment building, &quot;ZeroDavey&quot;, drew some criticism for its blue Davey Street facade, though it has some sandstone to blend in with the Hunter Street warehouses.

During 2004 there has also been discussions about a proposal for a tourist tram from Sullivans Cove to the CBD, and possibly to North Hobart.

An international design competition was held for the Hobart waterfront in 2006. It attracted 280 entries from over 50 countries. Three winners were announced on January 26, 2007, including entries by Jeppe Aagaard Andersen, Preston Lane Architects and Tony Caro Architecture. Many proposals indicated a return to the Hobart Rivulet as a canal on its original alignment at Constitution Dock, with a civic and reconciliation space linking the Hobart City Hall Axis. The designs were not for construction.

With the change in the cove&#x27;s primary activity from a freight port to tourism and recreational uses, many of the sheds in the area have been either re-purposed or replaced – notably, all buildings keep the former gabled roof architecture. These buildings include:
*Elizabeth Street Pier – restaurants, bar and function space
*Princes Wharf Shed No. 1 – redeveloped as &quot;PW1&quot; event space in 2011
*Princes Wharf Shed No. 2 – replaced in 2012 as the University of Tasmania&#x27;s Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies centre 
*Macquarie Wharf Shed No. 1 – to be replaced in 2015 with a luxury hotel (under construction)
*Macquarie Wharf Shed No. 2 – redeveloped in 2013 as &quot;MAC02 cruise ship terminal&quot;
*Brooke Street Pier – replaced in 2014–2015 with a ferry terminal/tourism transport hub

Additional development in the immediate area include a $100m redevelopment of Parliament Square, behind Parliament House. In 2015, a vacant lot and the Mawson&#x27;s Huts replica were proposed to be redeveloped into a Civic Square.

<doc id="1107615" wikidata="Q11542703" url="?curid=1107615" title="Metagonimiasis">
<text>Metagonimiasis is a disease caused by an intestinal trematode, most commonly &quot;Metagonimus yokagawai&quot;, but sometimes by &quot;M. takashii&quot; or &quot;M. miyatai&quot;. The metagonimiasis-causing flukes are one of two minute flukes called the heterophyids. Metagonimiasis was described by Katsurasa in 1911–1913 when he first observed eggs of &quot;M. yokagawai&quot; in feces (date is disputed in various studies). &quot;M. takahashii&quot; was described later first by Suzuki in 1930 and then &quot;M. miyatai&quot; was described in 1984 by Saito.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The main symptoms are diarrhea and colicky abdominal pain. Because symptoms are often mild, infections can often be easily overlooked but diagnosis is important. Flukes attach to the wall of the small intestine, but are often asymptomatic unless in large numbers. Infection can occur from eating a single infected fish source. Peripheral eosinophilia is associated especially in early phase. When present in large numbers, can cause chronic intermittent diarrhea, nausea, and vague abdominal pains. Clinical complaints can also include lethargy and anorexia. In acute metagonimiasis, clinical manifestations are developed only 5–7 days after infection. Heavy infection has also been associated with epigastric distress, fatigue, and malaise.

Occasionally, flukes invade the mucosa and eggs deposited in tissue may gain access to circulation. This can then lead to eggs embolizing in the brain, spinal cord, or heart. Granulomas may form around eggs and can cause seizures, neurologic deficits, or cardiac insufficiency.

An interesting case in Japan found diabetes mellitus (DM) to be a sign of chronic infection with intracerebral hemorrhages as the acute sign of aggravation&lt;. Two months after administering praziquantel, the hemorrhages were gone, as was the diabetes. This unique case shows the potential of additional symptoms associated with metagonimiasis that are still unknown.

==Cause==
Metagonimiasis is most commonly caused by one of the two smallest flukes known to infect man, &quot;Metagonimus yokogawai&quot;, also called the Japanese fluke. More rarely, metagonimiasis can arise from infection with &quot;M. takahashii&quot; or &quot;M. miyatai&quot;. Recent studies analyzing the DNA of the three agents causing metagonimiasis found that DNA sequencing supports &quot;M. yokagawai&quot; and &quot;M. takahashii&quot; be placed in the same clade, and phylogenic tree analysis supports their genetic similarity. &quot;M. miyatai&quot;, however, was found to be more genetically distinct, and the authors concluded it should be nominated as a separate species. An additional study examining karyotype data on the three disease-causing agents also supported the nomination of &quot;M. miyatai&quot; as a separate species.

Trematodes are one class of phylum &quot;Platyhelminthes&quot; from the order &quot;Digenea&quot; and are generally referred to as flukes. Metagonimiasis is of the family &quot;Heterophyidae&quot;.

=== Transmission ===
Transmission requires two intermediate hosts, the first of which is snails, most commonly of species &quot;Semisucospira libertina&quot;, &quot;Semiculcospira coreana&quot;, and &quot;Thiara granifera&quot;.

Infection is acquired through the secondary intermediate host, fish, that have not been thoroughly cooked. Metacercariae encyst under the scales or in the flesh of fish from fresh or brackish water. Sweetfish (&quot;Pecoglossus altevelis&quot;) is one of the most common fish species infected, but others include the golden carp (&quot;Carassius auratus&quot;), common carp (&quot;Cyprinus carpio&quot;), &quot;Zacco temminckii, Protimus steindachneri, Acheilognathus lancedata&quot;, and &quot;Pseudorashora parva&quot;.

Definitive hosts include humans and various fish-eating mammals, primarily dogs, cats, and pigs. Fish-eating birds may also be infected with metagonimiasis.

=== Reservoirs ===
Reservoirs include fish-eating mammals such as dogs, cats and pigs as well as fish-eating birds. The presence of heterophyid infection in humans is generally caused by a lack of &quot;host specificity&quot; by the parasites, as seen in the many non-human reservoirs for metagonimiasis. The many reservoirs also have negative implications on the efficacy of prevention and eradication efforts of the disease.

=== Incubation period ===
The incubation period is around 14 days and infestation may persist for more than one year.

=== Morphology ===

The morphology of the eggs is very important for diagnosis, but is difficult as eggs are very small. Eggs have a smooth, hard shell that is transparent and yellow-brown with a more conventional, ovoid egg shape. They are about the same size as those of &quot;Heterophyes&quot; and &quot;Clonorchis&quot;, usually measuring 26-28 μm length and 15-17μm width. The egg also has a very slight opercular shoulder, marking the line of cleavage between the shell and operculum, an &quot;escape hatch&quot; for the miracidium. The &quot;Clonorchis&quot; has more distinctive tapering and a seated operculum that help distinguish it more readily from &quot;Metagonimus&quot; species.

==== Adult flukes ====
The body of the adult disease-causing agent of metagonimiasis is often described as leaf-shaped, similar to most trematodes. It is one of the smallest intestinal flukes, and is only slightly larger than &quot;Heteropheres&quot;. The most prominent feature is that its ventral sucker is deflected to the right of its midline and is closely associated with the opening of the genital pore. The testes are large and diagonal to each other while the smaller ovary is anterior to the testes and the uterus is filled with eggs. The uterus winds forward to the genital pore and is the largest organ in the body. The size of the adult fluke does not exceed 2.5 mm length by .75 mm width.

== Diagnosis ==
Metagonimiasis is diagnosed by eggs seen in feces. Only after antihelminthic treatment will adult worms be seen in the feces, and then can be used as part of a diagnostic procedure. A 1993 analysis of the efficacy of ELISA tests to diagnose metagonimiasis implied that simultaneous screening of specific antibodies to several parasite agents are important in serological diagnosis of acute parasitic disease and more research should be done on the efficacy of these methods of diagnosis.

Diagnosis may be difficult because the egg-laying capacity of heterophyids is limited, and therefore sedimentation concentration procedures may be needed to demonstrate eggs in lighter infections. Accurate species identification is also difficult because eggs of most flukes are similar in size and morphology, especially those of &quot;Heterophyes heterophyes&quot;, &quot;Clonorchis&quot; and &quot;Opisthorchis&quot;. It is important to ask where the person may have contracted the disease, find out if they have been to en endemic area, and check for signs and symptoms that would lead to metagonimiasis.

== Prevention ==
Several public health prevention strategies could help lower the rates of metagonimiasis. One is to control the intermediate host (snails). This can be done through use of molluscidals. Another is to use education to ensure all people, especially in areas were the disease regularly occurs, fully cook all fish. This could potentially be problematic and not as effective as hoped as many of the people affected by metagonimiasis eat raw or pickled fish as part of a traditional, long-seated dietary practice. Additionally, implementing more sanitary water conditions would reduce the continual reintroduction of eggs to water sources, thus restarting the lifecycle. Complete control of metagonimiasis presents several potential problems because it does have several reservoir hosts, thus eradication is unlikely.

== Treatment ==
Praziquantel is recommended in both adult and pediatric cases with dosages of 75 mg/kg/d in 3 doses for 1 day. Praziquantel is a Praziniozoquinoline derivative that alters the calcium flux through the parasite tectum and causes muscular paralysis and detachment of the fluke. Prizaquantel should be taken with liquids during a meal and as provided commercially as Biltricide. Praziquantel is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of metagonimiasis, but is approved for use on other parasitic infections.

Praziquantel has some side effects but they are generally relatively mild and transient and a review of evidence shows it overall a well-tolerated drug. Possible side effects include abdominal pain, allergy, diarrhea, headache, liver problems, nausea or vomiting, exacerbation of porphyries, pruritus, rash, somnolence, vertigo, or dizziness. In fact, in 2002, the World Health Organization recommended the use of Praziquantel in pregnant and lactating women, though controlled trials are still needed to verify this.

Another possible drug option is Tetrachloroethylene, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, but its use has been superseded by new antihelminthic drugs (like Praziquantel). A 1978 study also looked at the efficacy of several drugs on metagonimiasis infection, including bithionol, niclosamide, nicoflan, and Praziquantel. All drugs showed lower prevalence of eggs in feces, however only Praziquantel showed complete radical cure. Therefore, the authors concluded Praziquantel was the most highly effective, was very well tolerated, and was the most promising drug against metagonimiasis.

== Epidemiology ==
Metagonimiasis infections are endemic or potentially endemic in 19 countries including Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan, the Balkans, Spain, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. Human infections outside endemic areas may result from ingesting pickled fish or sushi made from fish imported from endemic areas.

=== Korea ===
Food-borne trematodes are currently the most important parasitic infections in Korea and approximately 240,000 Koreans are believed to be currently infected. Of the 240,000 estimated to be infected, 120,000 are caused by M. yokagawai, 20,000 by M. takahashii, and 100,000 by M. miyatai. The national rate of infections among randomly selected people was 1.2% in 1981, 1.0% in 1986, and down to 0.5% in 2004. M. yokagawai infections are found mostly around the large and small streams where sweetfish live and have been identified as endemic foci. M. miyatai and M. takahashii are prevalent along the upper reaches of the big rivers where minnows and carps are caught for eating raw.

=== Japan ===
Metagonimiasis is also common in Japan, with 10-15% prevalence rates in populations bordering major rivers and 150,000 estimated infected. Food-borne trematodes are most common in rural areas where traditional food habits are more preserved and raw freshwater fishes are incorporated into the diet. Both clonorchiasis and metagonimiasis have become infections of higher social classes in Hong Kong and Japan, owing to their frequent consumption of raw fish.

=== India ===
There have also recently been two reported cases in India, a location in which occurrence of infection is almost unknown. The second case, in 2005, was in a 6-year-old female patient presenting with loose watery stools for four days (however more details were not obtained as the patient was both deaf and dumb since birth). Upon examination, M. yokagawai eggs were found in stool, but the patient left and further analysis and treatment could not be completed.

<text>Undertone or Undertones may refer to:

==Music==
* Undertone series, a sequence of notes that results from inverting the intervals of the overtone series
* The Undertones, Northern Irish band
** &quot;The Undertones&quot; (album), 1979 album by The Undertones
* Northwestern Undertones, a cappella group at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois, United States
* From woodwind instruments: Undertones may emerge as the tone component(s) of a note&#x27;s sound which are lower in pitch than the frequency of the note. 
Examples of woodwind undertones: 
** Every note above low-G on a GHB pipe chanter entails some undertone of low-G; the energy of the low-G undertone comes from the dual side-holes towards the bottom end of the pipe chanter. 
** Much more rarely considered is the sound - as undertone - which emerges from the very bottom of the chanter and might be termed: horntone, horn-note, belltone, or - most politely and concisely - the bellnote. 
** The practical (conventional) fingering of notes entails further undertones such as: low-A emerging with fingered E, and C(#) &amp; B undertones but not low-A with fingered D. 
Relevance: Ill-tuned lower notes may - as undertones - mess-up the practical sound (tuning) of higher notes. 

Separate pipes of a pipe organ, or of a GHB versus the pipe chanter - that is the drones - should not be practically discussed as undertones; they can be turned on and turned off, so each separate pipe is considered to produce its&#x27; own sound(s).

<doc id="1107632" wikidata="Q2304426" url="?curid=1107632" title="South Eastern Freeway">
<text>South Eastern Freeway is a freeway in South Australia (SA). It is a part of the National Highway network linking the state capital cities of Adelaide, SA, and Melbourne, Victoria, and is signed as route M1. It carries traffic over the Adelaide Hills between Adelaide and the River Murray, near Murray Bridge, where it is connected via the Swanport Bridge to the Dukes Highway, which is the main road route to Victoria. 

It was formerly signposted as Princes Highway, which refers to the coastal route from Adelaide to Sydney via Melbourne.

It is often referred to by South Australians simply as the freeway, as it was the first freeway in South Australia, and is still the longest, and the only one with &quot;Freeway&quot; in its name rather than &quot;Expressway&quot; or &quot;Highway&quot;. South Eastern Freeway includes twin-tube tunnels – the Heysen Tunnels – in the descent towards Adelaide, the first of their kind on the National Highway.

==Route==
South Eastern Freeway commences at the intersection with Glen Osmond Road, Cross Road and Portrush Road in Glen Osmond, and heads southeast as a six-lane, dual-carriageway route. As it traverses across – and through, in one section, via the Heysen Tunnels – the Adelaide Hills, and due the fact the freeway is a major freight route, it also features arrester beds and concrete median barriers, with street lighting between Glen Osmond and Crafers. The freeway narrows to four lanes just before it bypasses Crafers, and continues in a south-easterly direction, past Stirling, Hahndorf and Mount Barker, before narrowing further to a two-lane, single-carriageway, crossing the Murray River over the Swanport Bridge, to terminate just east of the crossing in Long Flat, south-east of Murray Bridge.

==History==
Prior to the initial construction of the freeway in the 1960s, inbound and outbound road traffic between Adelaide and south-eastern South Australia or Victoria used a two-lane highway originally built in the early part of the 20th century. With growth in Adelaide&#x27;s population, issues of congestion and safety mandated reconstruction. Studies began in 1962 for a freeway commencing from Crafers, that endpoint selected arguably due to the massive expenditure required with the precedent upgrade of the Mount Barker Road.

Construction began in 1965 from Crafers. The first stage of eastbound traffic lanes were opened in 1967, and the first westbound section opened in 1969. The freeway was opened in stages as construction progressed. The final section bypassing the town of Murray Bridge and connecting to the new Swanport Bridge over the River Murray opened in 1979, providing an alternative to the historic bridge in Murray Bridge.

The Adelaide–Crafers Highway extension came as a much-needed upgrade and replacement to the previous link road, the Mount Barker Road, which had been contoured to the Adelaide Hills, giving rise to many steep turns, ascending a tortuous route. The tightest hairpin turn on the Mount Barker Road was infamous as the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Elbow&quot;, often the site of car and semi-trailer accidents.

On 16 May 1995, Prime Minister Paul Keating announced the construction of the new Adelaide-Crafers section. The Heysen Tunnels, named after well-known South Australian artist and benefactor Hans Heysen, were completed in 1998. Construction was completed in early 2000. In March 2000, Prime Minister John Howard opened the new road. It was the largest South Australian road project at that time, costing A$151 million, wholly funded by the Australian Federal Government.
An additional exit was built at Monarto around 1999 to service an expanding commercial zone and the Monarto Zoo in the area. Another exit was announced in 2014 at Bald Hills Road, 4 km southeast of the Mount Barker interchange to service growing housing estates in southern Mount Barker and Nairne. Bardavcol started construction in May 2015, with the interchange including entry and exit ramps in both directions. The $27mil project was funded with $16mil by the Federal Government, $8mil by the Government of South Australia and $3mil from the Mount Barker District Council. The new interchange opened on 15 August 2016.

The Freeway bypasses many towns previously along the Princes Highway, including:

* Eagle On The Hill
* Crafers
* Stirling
* Aldgate
* Bridgewater
* Verdun
* Hahndorf
* Mount Barker
* Littlehampton
* Nairne
* Kanmantoo
* Callington
* Monarto
* Murray Bridge
==Road safety==
Shortly after the Adelaide–Crafers section opened, several incidents involving semi-trailers drew media attention to the road. While the previous Mount Barker Road was a notorious stretch, its dangers were well known; the new freeway presented the new challenge of a sustained continuous gradient with traffic lights at the bottom. Heavy vehicles with inadequate braking found it hard to slow down once they had exceeded a certain speed; this was made worse with brake failures. It took some time, and the addition of several warning signs prior to the descent, for heavy vehicles to become familiar with the freeway&#x27;s characteristics. Semi-trailers can be seen travelling as slow as 20–30 km/h downhill. In 2005 changeable electronic road signs were installed every 200 metres, so that the speed limit of the road can be adjusted from Transport SA headquarters in Adelaide. This has both improved safety for commuters, and emergency service workers like the Country Fire Service.

In 2010 and 2011, after more incidents involving trucks having problems successfully braking down the hill, including one going into a bus stop, and another going straight through the intersection at the bottom, the government added new laws that any vehicle with 5 axles or more must stay in the left lane and must not exceed a 60 km/h limit from the interchange at Crafers to the old tollhouse. More safety cameras were installed in an attempt to ensure trucks abide by this new limit.

Additional signs for the two arrester beds on the descent have been added, to encourage out of control drivers to use them as a safer alternative.

In August 2014, another truck descending the hills collided with cars at the intersection of Glen Osmond Road. Two people were killed. A driver of a sewage truck lost control after passing the arrestor beds. The driver was a new employee, who had never driven a manual truck before, and had never driven any vehicle on this segment of road. Driver Darren Hicks was seriously injured and testified against employer Cleanaway at a criminal trial after being granted immunity. The prosecution, brought by Comcare, heard that the brakes on the vehicle were defective. In 2021 Cleanaway was convicted of eight charges under health and safety legislation.

==Connections==
The Adelaide end of South Eastern Freeway leads downhill to traffic lights at the intersection of Glen Osmond Road which continues northwest as route number A1 into the Adelaide city centre, Portrush Road north to bypass the city and towards Port Adelaide, and Cross Road which leads west towards the southern suburbs of Adelaide.

The southeastern end of the freeway, near Murray Bridge, feeds onto the Swanport Bridge, a two-lane, bridge over the River Murray, where it joins Princes Highway, a dual-carriageway highway to Tailem Bend. At this point, Highway 1 becomes a two-laned, two-way scenic route which passes through many coastal towns of South Australia and Victoria. The National Highway continues to Melbourne as Dukes Highway (A8) from Tailem Bend to the Victorian border and beyond as Western Highway.

<doc id="1107633" wikidata="Q10504191" url="?curid=1107633" title="George Read (Alberta politician)">
<text>George Read, within the politics of Canada, is the former leader of the Alberta Greens and formerly a key organizer for the federal Green Party of Canada (GPC) in Alberta.

== Green Party organizing ==

Read led the provincial and federal Green Parties in Alberta during a period (what period) of growth in support for the parties. Prior to his involvement, the Green Party remained well below 1% of the vote in Alberta. (Source needed)

===Alberta Greens===

Read was elected leader of the Alberta Greens at the provincial convention held in Red Deer on November 1, 2003. Read won the position against incumbent David Parker.

===Green Party of Canada===
Read brought together organizers for the Green Party of Canada who recruited the first full slate of Green candidates in Alberta for the 2004 federal election.

In that election, the Green Party of Canada received a higher percentage of votes in Alberta than in other provinces: the party won 6.3% of the popular vote in the province, and approximately 10% in the ridings of Calgary Centre-North (third highest Green vote percentage in Canada) and Calgary South Centre (fourth highest in Canada). Some commentators ascribed this to the relatively weak position of the Liberal Party of Canada and New Democratic Party in Alberta.

Read was the National campaign manager of the Green Party of Canada for the 2006 Federal election.

Read participated in a committee to decide staff changes in the GPC as of November 2006. One of the positions it would decide would be the National Campaign Manager.

== Election campaigns ==

In June 2004, he ran for election as the Green Party of Canada candidate in the federal riding of Calgary Southeast, finishing just behind the NDP candidate.

He ran for the provincial Greens in the Calgary-Egmont riding in the 2004 Alberta provincial election. Finishing just behind the Alberta Alliance and ahead of the NDP.

He was the Alberta Greens candidate in the June 12, 2007, by-election for the riding of Calgary Elbow.

Read was the leader of the Alberta Greens in the Mar 3rd 2008 provincial election. He ran in the riding of Calgary Northwest and received 4.95% of the vote. The Alberta Greens moved from 2.8% of the vote in 2004 to 4.6% of the vote in 2008 under Reads Leadership.

The Alberta Greens ran 79 candidates in 2008 up from 49 candidates in 2004.

===Partial electoral history===
== Personal history ==

Read was born and raised Feb 29, 1972 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

As a youth, he was a member of Scouts Canada, which he credits with giving him a love of the outdoors.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science/Management from the University of Calgary.

He has also been active for many years with the Sierra Club of Canada, in Calgary.

<text>The [[Communauté d&#x27;agglomération]] de l&#x27;Artois (Artois Comm.) is a former administrative entity in the Pas-de-Calais &quot;département&quot;, in northern France. Administrative center: Béthune.

It covered 59 communes, and had a population of approximately 210,000. It was the largest such &quot;communauté&quot; in Pas-de-Calais (but the most populated was the Communaupole of Lens-Liévin).

It is named after Artois, a former province of France. It was established in January 2002. It merged with the Communauté de communes de Nœux et environs in 2014, and was renamed &quot;Communauté d&#x27;agglomération de Béthune Bruay Nœux et environs&quot;. This was merged into the new Communauté d&#x27;agglomération de Béthune-Bruay, Artois-Lys Romane in 2017.

<text>The CKC Chinese Input System is a Chinese input method for computers that uses the four corner method to encode characters.

The encoding uses a maximum of 4 digits (&quot;0&quot; - &quot;9&quot;) to represent a Chinese character. All possible shapes of strokes that forms any given Chinese character are classified into 10 groups, each represented by one of the ten possible digits 0-9. Chinese characters can then be input by following the order in which the strokes are identified at the 4 corners of the character. As a result of this simplicity in coding using the ten numeric digits, users typically need to use only a numeric keypad to input Chinese.

Implementations for both Traditional and Simplified Chinese are available, though the coding principle applies to both. In other words, users only need to be trained once and the skill can be applied equally well to both Traditional and Simplified Chinese version of the CKC Chinese Input System.

Training courses on the CKC Chinese Input System are provided by training centres in CKC Centre for the Development of Information Technology for Chinese Language Teaching of The Hong Kong Institute of Education, IVE Haking Wong and of Hong Kong University.

==Mapping==
The mapping between groups of stokes and their corresponding digits 0-9 can be described by the following:

: 一橫二豎三點捺
: 叉四插五方塊六
: 七角八八九是小
: 撇與左勾都是零

This means: 1 represents a horizontal stroke, 2 a vertical or diagonal stroke, 3 a dot or left-to-right diagonal stroke, 4 two strokes in a cross shape, 5 three or more strokes in which one stroke intersects all others, 6 a box-shape, 7 where a stroke turns a corner, 8 the shape of the Chinese character 八 and its inverted form, 9 the shape of the Chinese character 小 and its inverted form, and 0 a right-to-left diagonal or left hook stroke.

==Coding principle : single character==
#Order of coding : start from the top left-hand corner, then the top right-hand corner, next followed by the bottom left-hand corner and finally the bottom right-hand corner. Example : CKC code for the character &quot;的&quot; 　 is 0760
#When there are more than 1 way to encode, use one which covers more strokes of the character. Example : the CKC code for the character &quot;綜　&quot; is 2399 as opposed to 2393.
#Encode each of the shapes ONCE only. Example : the CKC code for the character &quot;香&quot; 　is 06 as opposed to 0066.
#When there are more than 1 way to encode, code of the strokes at the left-most or right-most side of the character is preferred. Example : the CKC code for the character &quot;非&quot; is 1111 as opposed to 2222.
#Strokes positioned at the top most of the character is given priority to code rather than those at lower position. Example : The CKC code for the character &quot;成&quot; is 5307 as opposed to 7307.

==Coding principle : phrase==
==Software availability==
The software can be downloaded from The CKC Chinese Input System web site and can be run on the Microsoft Windows environment. Other platforms such as Linux, Palm and Pocket PC are under development.

==WebCKC==
It is also possible to use the CKC Chinese Input System without installing it on a PC. The WebCKC allows any PC connected to Internet using the MS Internet Explorer to input Chinese Characters using the CKC Chinese Input System.

You can try out the traditional Chinese version or the Simplified Chinese version . Note that you need to use keyboard with numeric keypad in order to input Chinese with this method.

Text entered are stored in the clipboard and therefore ready to be pasted to any desired application.
