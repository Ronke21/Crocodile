<text>Text figures (also known as non-lining, lowercase, old style, ranging, hanging, medieval, billing, or antique figures or numerals) are numerals designed with varying heights in a fashion that resembles a typical line of running text, hence the name. They are contrasted with lining figures (also called titling or modern figures), which are the same height as upper-case letters. Georgia is an example of a popular typeface that employs text figures by default. 

== Design ==

In text figures, the shape and positioning of the numerals vary as those of lowercase letters do. In the most common scheme, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, and &quot;2&quot; are of x-height, having neither ascenders nor descenders; &quot;6&quot; and &quot;8&quot; have ascenders; and &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, and &quot;9&quot; have descenders. Other schemes exist; for example, the types cut by the Didot family of punchcutters and typographers in France between the late 18th and early 19th centuries typically had an ascending &quot;3&quot; and &quot;5&quot;, a form preserved in some later French typefaces. A few other typefaces used different arrangements. Sometimes the stress of the &quot;0&quot; is made different from a letter &quot;o&quot; in some way, although many fonts do not do this.

High-quality typesetting generally prefers text figures in body text: they integrate better with lowercase letters and small capitals, unlike runs of lining figures. Lining figures are called for in all-capitals settings (hence the alternative name &quot;titling figures&quot;), and may work better in tables and spreadsheets. 

Although many conventional typefaces have both types of numerals in full, early digital fonts only had one or the other (with the exception of those used by professional printers). Modern OpenType fonts generally include both, and being able to switch via codice_1 and codice_2 feature tags. The few common digital fonts that default to using text figures include Candara, Constantia, Corbel, Hoefler Text, Georgia, Junicode, some variations of Garamond (such as the open-source EB Garamond), and FF Scala. Palatino and its clone FPL Neu support both text and lining figures.

== History ==
As the name &quot;medieval numerals&quot; implies, text figures have been in use since the Middle Ages, when Arabic numerals reached 12th century Europe, where they eventually supplanted Roman numerals.

Lining figures came out of the new middle-class phenomenon of shopkeepers’ hand-lettered signage. They were introduced to European typography in 1788, when Richard Austin cut a new font for typefounder and publisher John Bell, which included three-quarter height lining figures. They were further developed by 19th-century type designers, and largely displaced text figures in some contexts, such as newspaper and advertising typography. During the period of transition from text figures to lining, a justification for the old system was that the height differences helped distinguish similar numbers, while a justification for lining figures was that they were clearer (being larger) and that they looked better by giving all page numbers the same height. Amusingly, as several later writers have noted, the printer Thomas Curson Hansard in his landmark textbook on printing &quot;Typographia&quot; describes the new fashion as &#x27;preposterous&#x27;, but the book was printed using lining figures and the modern typefaces he also criticised throughout.

While always popular with fine printers, text figures became rarer still with the advent of phototypesetting and early digital technologies with limited character sets and no support for alternate characters. Walter Tracy noted that they were avoided by phototypesetting manufacturers since (not being of even height) they could not be miniaturised to form fraction numerals, requiring an additional set of fraction characters. They made a comeback with more advanced digital typesetting systems.

Modern professional digital fonts are almost universally in one or another variant of the OpenType format and encode both text and lining figures as OpenType alternate characters. Text figures are not encoded separately in Unicode, because they are not considered separate characters from lining figures, only a different way of writing the same characters. Adobe&#x27;s early OpenType fonts used Private Use Area for non-default sets of numerals, but the most recent ones only use OpenType features.

<text>Units (commands) of the United States Navy are as follows. The list is organized along administrative chains of command (CoC), and does not include the CNO&#x27;s office or shore establishments.

Deployable/operational U.S. Navy units typically have two CoCs the chain and the chain. Operational CoCs change quite often based on a unit&#x27;s location and current mission. 

For example, is always administratively assigned to Commander, Naval Air Force, Atlantic Fleet (CNAL). It might also be operationally assigned to CNAL early in its inter-deployment readiness cycle (IDRC). Before 2010, later in the IDRC, it would have been assigned to Commander, Second Fleet, which is responsible for Carrier Strike Group (CSG) training and operations on the east coast. Once the CSG deploys and crosses over the inter-UCC boundary in the mid-Atlantic, it then reports (is &quot;chopped&quot;) to the Sixth Fleet (responsible for European waters and the Mediterranean Sea). Once the CSG enters the Suez Canal, it &quot;chops&quot; to the Fifth Fleet for operational control. Operationally, the &quot;Roosevelt&quot; CSG chain of command is: Commander Fifth Fleet, Commander U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, Commander U.S. Central Command, United States Secretary of Defense, President of the United States.

<doc id="1091514" wikidata="Q33342" url="?curid=1091514" title="Bila Tserkva">
<text>Bila Tserkva ( ; , ) is a city in central Ukraine. It is situated on the Ros River in the historical region of right-bank Ukraine. It is the largest city in Kyiv Oblast (which does not include the city of Kyiv) and serves as the administrative centre of Bila Tserkva Raion and Bila Tserkva urban hromada, and has a population of , 205,000 (2024 estimate). 

The oldest preserved document that mentions the city, at that time called &quot;Yuryiv&quot;, is the &quot;Hypatian Codex&quot; (1115). Historically, the city has been at the centre of the &quot;Porossia&quot; (River Ros) region. Founded as a border fortification of Kievan Rus&#x27;, Bila Tserkva later became property of Polish nobility and served as a prominent commercial centre. Since the 19th century, industry and tourism have been important elements of the city&#x27;s economy. Under Soviet rule, Bila Tserkva became a centre of agricultural education. During the Cold War, a major Soviet Air Force base was located near the city.

As part of independent Ukraine, Bila Tserkva served as a city of regional significance until 2020. In the aftermath of the administrative reform, it became the centre of one of &quot;hromadas&quot; (communities) of Kyiv Oblast.

==History==

Founded in 1032, the city was originally named Yuriiv by Yaroslav the Wise, whose Christian name was Yuri. The contemporary name of the city, literally translated, is &quot;White Church&quot; and may refer to the white-painted cathedral (no longer extant) of medieval Yuriiv. In its long history, Bila Tserkva spent its first few hundred years privately owned, later, though the owner was typically a citizen of the ruling empire, it was organized as a fiefdom, with important trade routes to Kyiv, Hungary, the Middle East and India, passing through it.

From its earliest incarnation, Bila Tserkva was considered to provide important defense against nomadic tribes that included both the Cumans and the Tatars. However, a 13th century invasion by the Mongols devastated the city, and illustrated the fallibility of its defense.

=== Lithuanian and Polish rule ===
From 1363, Bila Tserkva belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and from 1569 to the Kingdom of Poland within the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, administratively in the Kijów Voivodeship, part of Lesser Poland Province. It was crown property, but in recognition of his great service, it was granted to the Castellan of Kraków, Janusz Ostrogski. The next owner was Stanisław Lubomirski (1583–1649) and during his time the town was granted Magdeburg Rights by Sigismund III Vasa in 1620.
After subduing the rebellious Cossacks in the 1626 Battle of Bila Tserkva, the next owner of the estate was Prince Jerzy Dymitr Wiśniowiecki. The castle was successfully taken by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 1648. In 1651, it was also the site of the Battle of Bila Tserkva between the warring Zaporozhian Cossack Army (and their Tatar allies) and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, but Bila Tserkva was also where they made peace, and signed a Treaty. It was also where peace was achieved with the signing of the Treaty of Bila Tserkva. In 1666, six-thousand Muscovite troops laid siege to Bila Tserkva. The standoff lasted until the following year when Polish reinforcements led by Jan Stachurski with the aid of allied Cossacks and Iwan Brzuchowiecki smashed Petro Doroshenko&#x27;s stranglehold.

The next owner was Great Crown Hetman Stanislaw Jan Jabłonowski. In 1702, the castle was taken by the Cossack leader, Semen Paliy who made it his domain. In 1708, the town was overrun by prince Golitsyn&#x27;s Russian army. The next owner of the town was Jan Stanislaw Jabłonowski, then Stanisław Wincenty Jabłonowski who erected a catholic church. After him ownership passed to Jerzy August Mniszech. The town was substantially refortified.

In 1774, Bila Tserkva (Biała Cerkiew), then the seat of the sub-prefecture (Starostwo), came into the possession of Stanisław August Poniatowski who that same year granted the property to Franciszek Ksawery Branicki, Poland&#x27;s Grand Hetman who then built his urban residence, the Winter Palace complex and a country residence with the &quot;Oleksandriia&quot; Arboretum (named after his wife Aleksandra Branicka). He founded the Catholic Church of John the Baptist, and started construction of the Orthodox church, which was completed by his successor, his son Count Władysław Grzegorz Branicki. The latter also built the gymnasium-school complex in Bila Tserkva. Aleksander Branicki, the youngest grandson of the hetman, renovated and finished Mazepa&#x27;s Orthodox church. Under the rule of count Władysław Michał Branicki, Bila Tserkva developed into a regional commercial and manufacturing centre.

Various Polish Crown Army units were stationed in the city at various times, including the 5th and 6th National Cavalry Brigades and 4th Infantry Regiment.

=== The Russian Empire ===

In 1791, Russia&#x27;s Catherine II, included Bila Tserkva in the region that came to be known as the Pale of Settlement, which encompassed parts of seven contemporary nations, including large swaths of modern-day Ukraine. Bila Tserkva was formally annexed into the Russian Empire as a result of the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Meanwhile, after 1861, the Czarist authorities converted Roman Catholic churches into Orthodox Churches. By the late 18th century, however, Jews were already living in the region, and within a century they would comprise nearly half the population of the city. An important Jewish city, as a result, by the early 1900s it was a fount of idea about politics, religion, art, and culture, with an active Zionist movement, an active branch of the Decembrist movement and a branch of the Society of United Slavs formulating&quot;plans to assassinate Tsar Alexander I by Sergei Muravev-Apostol and his co-conspirators.&quot; Home to many artists and writers, Sholem Aleichem and Shaye Shkarovsky were both writing in Yiddish, with Ivan Nechuy-Levytsky writing in Ukrainian. It also was the home of artists like Luka Dolinski and Halyna Nevinchana; as well as theater and film directors Eugene Deslaw and Les Kurbas..

=== Soviet rule and Nazi occupation ===
During the first two decades of the 20th century, the city&#x27;s Jewish residents were subject to multiple pogroms. In 1919 and 1920 alone, pogroms were responsible for the deaths of 850 Jews. In 1932–1933, as many as 22,000 of greater Bila Tserkva&#x27;s residents died in the Holodomor.

During World War II, Bila Tserkva was occupied by the German Army from 16 July 1941 to 4 January 1944. In August 1941 Bila Tserkva was the site the Nazi massacre, now known as the Bila Tserkva massacre of the city&#x27;s Jewish population, which required the separate executions of nearly 100 children. A Monument to Jewish Children and the Holocaust was unveiled in Bila Tserkva in 2019.
During the Cold War, the town was host to the 72nd Guards Krasnograd Motor Rifle Division and the 251st Instructor Heavy Bomber Aviation Regiment of Long Range Aviation.

===Independent Ukraine===
Until 18 July 2020, Bila Tserkva was incorporated as a city of oblast significance and served as the administrative center of Bila Tserkva Raion even though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kyiv Oblast to seven, the city of Bila Tserkva was merged into Bila Tserkva Raion.

During the Battle of Vasylkiv, a Russian Il-76, carrying over 100 paratroopers, was allegedly shot down over Bila Tserkva.

== Jewish history ==
In Jewish folklore the city came to be referred to as the &quot;Black Contamination&quot; (Yid. &quot;Shvartse Tume&quot;), a play on its name in Russian (&quot;White Church&quot;). The earliest Jewish inhabitants have been traced to 1648. The population, however, has risen and fallen due to outbreaks of violence and, later, pogroms. By the end of the 19th century, Jews made up a slight majority of the population at 52.9% of the city&#x27;s total population, or 18,720 total inhabitants. According to the Jewish Virtual Library, in 1904, Jews owned 250 workshops and 25 factories engaged in light industry employing 300 Jewish workers.&quot; Cossack-led attacks, Stalin&#x27;s purges, pogroms and the Holocaust, including the horrors of the Bila Tserkva massacre, caused a major demographic shift. By 2001, it was mostly inhabited by ethnic Ukrainians, with a meager Jewish population of less than 0.1%.

In the late 1980s, Kyiv&#x27;s Judaica Institute began taking form&quot;after the tragic decades of Bolshevik repressions, Nazi genocide of the Jewish people, and bans on Jewish studies&quot; to research and &quot;popularize the past and the present of the Jewish community of Ukraine.&quot;

In 1991, Ukraine declared independence, and two years after the 2014 Revolution of Dignity, Volodymyr Groysman became Ukraine&#x27;s first Jewish prime minister. Three years later, Ukraine elected Volodymyr Zelenskyy as its first Jewish president. A 2017 Pew Research study found that Ukraine was the most accepting of Jews among all Central and Eastern European countries, a later research study in 2019 confirmed those results.

== Economy ==
An important regional center during Lithuanian and, later, Polish rule, Bila Tserkva remained prominent due to its close proximity to Kyiv, and its place at the center of Europe&#x27;s &quot;breadbasket,&quot; with some of the continent&#x27;s most fertile land. The city economy first began diversifying in the late 1700s, when Alexandra Branicki, the wife of the Polish Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki had a 400-hectare landscaped park designed.

<doc id="1091522" wikidata="Q2409915" url="?curid=1091522" title="Procession (New Order song)">
<text>&quot;Procession&quot; is the second single by the British group New Order, released in September 1981 on 7&quot; vinyl record. It is a double A side with &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot;. The single&#x27;s Factory Records catalogue number is FAC 53. (Labelled as B Music)
==Artwork==
Similar to the album cover for &quot;Movement&quot;, the artwork is taken from a &quot;Dinamo Futurista&quot; magazine cover done by Italian futurist designer Fortunato Depero. Notably, the UK release&#x27;s sleeve came in nine versions, all with different colours: black, blue, aqua, yellow, red, brown, orange, green and purple. The second side of the single contains a shortened version of &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot;, the full-length version of which was later released as a 12&quot; single on its own.

Although the original UK single does not indicate which is side A or B (the runoff matrix simply lists &quot;SOFT&quot; and &quot;HARD&quot; for each side), the French edition of the single actually has &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; labeled as the A-side track, and some Spanish and Portuguese pressings have reversed labels.

<doc id="1091527" wikidata="Q2382467" url="?curid=1091527" title="Wootton Bridge">
<text>Wootton Bridge is a large village, civil parish and electoral ward with about 3,000 residents on the Isle of Wight, first recorded around the year 1086. The parish also contains the settlement of Wootton.

Wootton is found midway between the towns of Ryde and Newport, which are 7 miles apart, and historically centred on the old parish church of St Edmund. The hamlet of Wootton Common to the south, centres on the crossroads that bears its name.

The newer village of Wootton Bridge is found in the area immediately west of Wootton Creek, and the parish council that bears its name is now responsible for the whole of the Wootton area.

==Village name==
Wootton&#x27;s name is said to mean &quot;Woodtown&quot;, which means a clearing in a forest, although other interpretations do exist. The first known mention of the town as &quot;Odetone&quot; or &quot;Wootten&quot; was in 1086, and the name has evolved and changed much over the past millennium.
More recently, following the construction of the bridge across Wootton Creek, the name &quot;Wootton Bridge&quot; has been used to describe the settlement closest to it, however this name is now also used by some to refer to the whole of Wootton. This is possibly due in part to Royal Mail, who used the name &quot;Wootton Bridge&quot; to differentiate Wootton from the 19 other Woottons found across England.

&quot;Wootton Bridge&quot; is described by some as the &quot;modern name&quot; for the area. However, &quot;Wootton&quot; remains firmly established on wayfinding signs and maps of the island, including those of Ordnance Survey and remains the most popular name for the area.

==Isle of Wight Festival 1969==
The 1969 Isle of Wight Festival took place on 29 to 31 August at Woodside Bay in Wootton. The event was one of the largest music festivals to that date, and had an estimated audience of some 150,000. The line-up included Bob Dylan, The Band, The Nice, The Pretty Things, Marsha Hunt, The Who, Third Ear Band, Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, Fat Mattress and Joe Cocker.

==Wootton Creek==

There is a millpond on Wootton Creek formed by a sluice gate in Wootton Bridge. At one time there was a second sluice gate in the bridge that would use the tidal water from the millpond to power a mill grinding flour. The mill was demolished in 1962 and houses later built on the site.

The pond is part of a Special Area of Conservation and is important for wildfowl and for bats. The heron has been adopted as the symbol of the village. Firestone Copse is a Forestry Commission woodland open to the public which is situated on the edge of the pond.

==Notable features==
===St. Edmund&#x27;s Church===

St. Edmund&#x27;s Parish Church dates from the 11th century. St. Mark&#x27;s Church, Wootton is in the south end of the village.

===The Sloop Inn===
The Sloop is another prominent building in Wootton, with its prime position next to Wootton Bridge. The pub is about 150 years old, and is currently managed by Mitchells &amp; Butlers as part of its Crown Carveries pub chain.

===The Fernhill Ice House===
In an area of woodland adjacent to agricultural land and public footpaths just outside the village of Wooton, an ice house can be found in excellent condition, having been maintained by the council since the 1980s. This structure is one of a few remnants of a grand estate called Fernhill, which was destroyed by fire in 1938.

==Transport==
Southern Vectis bus routes 4, 9 and 34 link Wootton with the towns of Newport, Ryde and East Cowes, including intermediate villages.

===Wootton Station===

Wootton Station is the western terminus of the Isle of Wight Steam Railway. The current station, opened in 1987, is in a different location from the original which was closed in 1953. However the authentic station signage from the original is in place in the newer station.
==Notable residents==
Victorian admiral Sir John Baird died in Wootton in 1908, he is buried in the churchyard.

A swingman, Havlicek played collegiate basketball for the Ohio State Buckeyes from 1959 to 1962, winning an NCAA championship in 1960. He was drafted by the Celtics in 1962 and played with the team until his retirement in 1978. A 13-time NBA All-Star, Havlicek was named to the All-NBA First Team four times and to the All-NBA Second Team seven times. He was also named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team on five occasions and to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times. Havlicek is known for his stamina and his hustle as well as his abilities.

During his career with the Celtics, Havlicek won eight NBA championships, and he is also one of three NBA players with an unsurpassed 8–0 record in NBA Finals series. He is known for stealing the ball to save the game–and the Celtics&#x27; playoff hopes–near the end of Game Seven in the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. Havlicek served as captain of the Celtics from 1969 to 1978, and was named NBA Finals MVP in 1974. Following his retirement, his number 17 jersey was retired by the Celtics. Havlicek was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1984.

==Early life==
Havlicek was born in Martins Ferry, Ohio, where his parents ran a general store. He was of Czech and Croatian descent, from his father and mother respectively. Havlicek was a three-sport athlete at Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Ohio, where he was a boyhood friend of Baseball Hall of Famer Phil Niekro.

==Collegiate career==

Havlicek played college basketball at Ohio State University with future seven-time NBA All-Star Jerry Lucas, who was his roommate, future first-round NBA draft pick Larry Siegfried, future coaching legend Bobby Knight, and Mel Nowell, among many others. The 1960 Ohio State Buckeyes, coached by head coach Fred Taylor and assistant coaches Jack Graf and Frank Truitt, won the 1960 NCAA title. Havlicek was named as an alternate of the 1960 United States national team that competed in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

==Professional career==
===Boston Celtics (1962–1978)===
Havlicek was drafted by the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Cleveland Pipers of the American Basketball League (ABL), and the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) in 1962. However, after the Pipers failed in their bid to leave the ABL to join the NBA with Havlicek on that team due to him competing briefly as a wide receiver in the Browns&#x27; training camp that year, Havlicek focused his energies on playing for the Celtics going forward. A swingman who could play either guard or forward, he was known for his stamina, with competitors stating that it was a challenge just to keep up with him. Head coach Red Auerbach went on to call him &quot;the guts of the team&quot;. Nicknamed &quot;Hondo&quot; (a nickname inspired by the 1953 movie of the same name starring John Wayne), Havlicek revolutionized the &quot;sixth man&quot; role in the NBA coming off the bench for the Celtics during his early years.

Havlicek was later immortalized for his clutch steal in the closing seconds of the 1965 Eastern Conference Finals. In the seventh and final game, played at Boston Garden on April 15, the Celtics led the Philadelphia 76ers 110–109 with five seconds left. They only needed to inbound the ball from underneath their basket to secure the victory and advance to the 1965 NBA Finals. However, Bill Russell&#x27;s pass struck one of the basket&#x27;s support wires hanging down from the ceiling, leading to a turnover that gave the 76ers and Wilt Chamberlain the ball and a chance to win the game. Hal Greer was set to throw the inbounds pass for the 76ers. Havlicek stood with his back to Greer, guarding Chet Walker. But as Greer&#x27;s pass came inbounds, Havlicek spun, leaped, and tipped the pass to Sam Jones. Veteran referee Earl Strom, who wrote about the game in his memoir &quot;Calling the Shots&quot;, called Havlicek&#x27;s reaction one of the greatest plays he ever saw in his 32 years as a professional official. Announcer Johnny Most&#x27;s call of &quot;Havlicek stole the ball!&quot; was dubbed by the NBA as &quot;the most famous radio call in basketball history.&quot;

Havlicek was a key player in the Celtics&#x27; dynasty during the 1960s. The team won NBA championships in six of his first seven NBA seasons.

In Game 5 of the 1968 Eastern Division Finals, Havlicek recorded a near triple-double with 29 points, nine rebounds, and 10 assists as the Celtics avoided elimination at the hands of the 76ers. He added a strong performance in Game Seven, recording 21 points, 12 rebounds, and eight assists in a 100–96 road win against the 76ers. In that series, the Celtics became the first NBA team to overcome a 3–1 playoff series deficit.

Havlicek became a full-time starter in the 1969–1970 season. He also became the Celtics&#x27; captain in 1969, and continued in that role until 1978. Havlicek &quot;stood as the bridge from the Bill Russell era to the Celtics&#x27; next championship team&quot;. The Celtics won the 1974 NBA Championship, and Havlicek was named NBA Finals MVP.

With one second left in the second overtime of Game Five of the 1976 NBA Finals, Havlicek made a leaning, running bank shot that appeared to be the game-winner. Phoenix called an illegal timeout, resulting in a technical foul shot converted by Jo Jo White. However, Phoenix still had one final possession, and Gar Heard scored for Phoenix to tie the game. The Celtics went on to win in triple overtime. The game was hailed as the greatest NBA Finals game ever played.

Havlicek retired after the 1977–78 NBA season at age 38. In April 1978, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; stated: &quot;The consensus is that Havlicek is still better than 80 percent of the players in the NBA&quot;.

===Legacy===
&quot;&#x27;On stamina alone, he’d be among the top players who ever played the game,&#x27; longtime New York Knicks coach Red Holzman once said of John “Hondo” Havlicek. &quot;&#x27;It would’ve been fair to those who had to play him or those who had to coach against him if he had been blessed only with his inhuman endurance. God had to compound it by making him a good scorer, smart ballhandler and intelligent defensive player with quickness of mind, hands and feet&#x27;&quot;.

Havlicek retired as a 13-time NBA All-Star, and his number 17 jersey was retired by the Celtics. At the time, Havlicek was the NBA career leader in games played (a mark surpassed in 1984 by Elvin Hayes) and was in third place on the list of all-time NBA leaders in points scored. Longtime Celtics teammate Bill Russell once described Havlicek as &quot;&#x27;the best all-around ballplayer [he] ever saw&#x27;&quot;. At the time of his death, Havlicek was the Celtics&#x27; all-time leading scorer with 26,395 points (20.8 points per game). He was also the first player to score 1,000 points in 16 consecutive seasons, with his best scoring season coming during the 1970–71 season, when he averaged 28.9 points per game. He was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team five times and was named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team three times.

Havlicek finished his 16-year career with eight NBA championships. As of 2019, only Bill Russell (with 11) and Sam Jones (with 10)--both of whom were Celtics teammates of Havlicek&#x27;s--had won more NBA championships than he had. Havlicek won all eight NBA Finals in which he participated.

In 1980, Havlicek was selected as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players ever, being named to the NBA 35th Anniversary Team. In 1984, Havlicek became a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 1996, he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History by a panel of journalists, players, coaches, executives, and general managers. He was also named the 14th best player of all time in Bill Simmons&#x27;s &quot;Book of Basketball&quot;. In October 2021, Havlicek was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary, &quot;The Athletic&quot; published their own list of the top 75 players of all time, ranking Havlicek as the 29th-greatest player in NBA history.

In 1974, Havlicek received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2007, Bridgeport High School in his hometown renamed their gymnasium &quot;John J. Havlicek Gymnasium&quot;. Fellow NBA Hall of Famer Chris Mullin wore number 17 as a tribute to Havlicek. In October 2022, Havlicek was inaugurated into the Croatian-American Sports Hall of Fame. In December 2022, the NBA named the newly redesigned trophy presented to the NBA Sixth Man of the Year the “John Havlicek Trophy” in his honor.

In addition to his on-court success, Havlicek was known for his character and for his commitment to placing the team ahead of his own individual achievements. Longtime Celtics coach Red Auerbach once said, &quot;&#x27;If I ever had a son, I would want him to be like John Havlicek&#x27;&quot;.

==Post-playing career==
Havlicek was shrewd with his money during his playing career, and he invested much of this income in the Wendy&#x27;s fast food chain during its formative years. The success of his investments left Havlicek with a comfortable income after retirement and he never had to work for a conventional salary again. He had no desire to coach; instead, he served as a corporate speaker.

Havlicek was a member of the board of the Genesis Foundation, which assists children with disabilities and genetic disorders. He and his wife Beth held the John Havlicek Celebrity Fishing Tournament for more than three decades, with proceeds going to the foundation.

==Personal life==
Havlicek met his wife, Beth, while both were attending Ohio State University. The couple married in 1967. They had two children: a son named Chris and a daughter named Jill. Chris Havlicek attended the University of Virginia on a basketball scholarship in the early 1990s. Jill Havlicek married former Major League Baseball outfielder and coach Brian Buchanan.

Havlicek had Parkinson&#x27;s disease during his later years. He died on April 25, 2019, in Jupiter, Florida at the age of 79. Following his death, Boston City Hall was lit in green in his memory.

<doc id="1091540" wikidata="Q927989" url="?curid=1091540" title="Clairvoyance (album)">
<text>Clairvoyance is the 1986 debut studio album by the alternative rock band Screaming Trees, produced by Steve Fisk. Released on Velvetone Records, the album helped the band earn a contract with SST Records. While it is very much a combination of psychedelic and garage rock, it bears many similarities to early grunge. It was original limited to a pressing of 2,500 copies, which included full size, double sided inserts. In January 2005, it was re-issued on CD by Hall of Records.

Steve Fisk stated that after completing the record he attempted to book a tour for the band and sent their album to local radio stations with little to no traction, stating that &quot;no one wanted to hear about a band from Eastern Washington&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil listed &quot;Clairvoyance&quot; as one of his favourite grunge albums, stating: &quot;I like &quot;Clairvoyance&quot; for the song “Clairvoyance,” but my favorite song on there is probably “I See Stars” followed by “Orange Airplane.” After this album, they kind of fattened up their sound.&quot;

<text>The first USS &quot;Yarnall&quot; (DD–143) was a in the United States Navy during World War I later transferred to the Royal Navy as HMS &quot;Lincoln, to the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] asHNoMS &quot;Lincoln, and subsequently to the Soviet Navy as Druzhny.

== Construction and career ==
=== United States Navy service ===

Named for John Yarnall, she was laid down on 12 February 1918 at Philadelphia by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company. The destroyer was launched on 19 June 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Marie H. Bagley. The ship was commissioned on 29 November 1918, Commander William F. Halsey, Jr., in command.

Assigned to Division 15, Destroyer Force, &quot;Yarnall&quot; served briefly with United States naval forces in France during 1919. By 1 January 1920, her division had been reassigned to Flotilla 5, Destroyer Squadron 4, Pacific Fleet, and operated out of the San Diego destroyer base. Her division—redesignated Division 13 in February—received orders in April to proceed to the Asiatic station; but she apparently did not begin that assignment until late the following fall. &quot;Yarnall&quot; returned from the Far East to the United States late in the summer of 1921 and began repairs at Puget Sound. In December, she was reassigned to Division 11 and again operated out of San Diego until 29 May 1922 when she was decommissioned there and placed in reserve.

After almost eight years of inactivity, the destroyer was recommissioned at San Diego on 19 April 1930. Assigned initially to Division 11, Squadron 10, Battle Fleet Destroyer Squadrons, &quot;Yarnall&quot; operated briefly on the west coast before being transferred to the east coast sometime late in 1930. By New Year&#x27;s Day, 1931, her home port had been changed to Charleston, South Carolina. In March, she joined the Scouting Force under the command of Lt. Comdr. Thomas R. Cooley as a unit of Destroyer Division 3 but retained Charleston as her home port. The destroyer operated out of that base until late in the summer of 1934 when, though still a unit of Scouting Force Destroyers, she returned to the west coast. Based at San Diego, the warship remained active along the California coast until late in 1936. She then returned to the east coast and, on 30 December 1936, was placed out of commission at Philadelphia and berthed there with the reserve fleet.

As a part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s program to bolster the minuscule Atlantic Squadron after war broke out in Europe in September 1939, &quot;Yarnall&quot; ended her 21-month, second retirement on 4 October 1939 when she was recommissioned at Philadelphia. She became a unit of Destroyer Squadron 11 of the Atlantic Squadron, the small fleet assigned the enormous task of keeping war out of the western hemisphere. She operated out of Norfolk in the Neutrality Patrol until the fall of 1940 when the United States concluded the destroyers-for-bases deal with the United Kingdom. &quot;Yarnall&quot; was stricken from the United States Navy list on 8 January 1941 — soon after her transfer to the Royal Navy.

=== Royal Navy service ===

&quot;Yarnall&quot; was one of the 50 elderly destroyers chosen to be transferred to the Royal Navy in return for the right to establish American bases on British territory in the western hemisphere. She sailed to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, where she was decommissioned by the United States Navy on 23 October 1940; and, that same day, the Royal Navy commissioned her as Town-class destroyer HMS &quot;Lincoln&quot; with the pennant number G42.

The veteran destroyer departed St. John&#x27;s on 3 November and arrived in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on 9 November. &quot;Lincoln&quot; moved from there to Londonderry Port where she was assigned to the First Escort Group, Western Approaches Command. For almost a year, she met troop transport and cargo convoys in mid-ocean and escorted them into ports in the British Isles. Between September 1941 and February 1942, the destroyer was refitted at Woolwich Dockyard. &quot;Lincoln&quot; was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4&quot;/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog.

=== Royal Norwegian Navy service ===

After the refit, she was transferred to the exiled Royal Norwegian Navy as HNoMS &quot;Lincoln&quot; and served with the Western Local Escort Force, operating along the Newfoundland coast between Halifax, Nova Scotia and St. John&#x27;s. In July 1942, HNoMS &quot;Lincoln&quot; was loaned to the Royal Canadian Navy, though remaining under Norwegian colours. Her duty in Canadian waters continued until the end of 1943, when she returned to Britain departing Halifax on 19 December and arriving back in Londonderry Port on Christmas Day. Early in 1944, the venerable warship was placed in reserve in the River Tyne. Her service to the Allied cause, however, had not quite ended.

=== Soviet Navy service ===

On 26 August 1944, she was transferred to the Soviet Navy and renamed &quot;Druzhny&quot; (rus. Дружный, &quot;Friendly&quot;). There is some disagreement on her career in the Soviet Navy. Western sources indicate she was cannibalized to provide spare parts for eight sister ships provided to the Soviet Union in late 1944; one Russian source indicates she was used on active duty from 23 September 1944 until the end of the war, and was returned in August 1952 to Britain where she was sold for scrap.

<text>Wootton Creek is a tidal estuary that flows into the Solent on the north coast of the Isle of Wight. The estuary has also been known in the past as &quot;Fishbourne Creek&quot;, &quot;Wootton River&quot; and &quot;Wootton Haven&quot;.

At the mouth of the estuary is the Wightlink car ferry terminal for connections to Portsmouth. On the west bank of the creek is the village of Wootton, whilst on the east bank is the village of Fishbourne. The estuary is bridged by the main Ryde to Newport road, where there once was a tide mill. The estuary is not navigable south of the bridge, and tide controls means that water is retained south of the bridge most of the time, in the old mill pond.

To the south of the bridge, on the east side of the mill pond, is a Forestry Commission woodland called &quot;Firestone Copse&quot; which is about in size.

Since 1993 Wootton Creek and the adjacent Ryde Sands have been designated as SSSIs due to their wide range of intertidal sand flats.

<doc id="1091559" wikidata="Q2599950" url="?curid=1091559" title="Ceremony (New Order song)">
<text>&quot;Ceremony&quot; is a song written by Joy Division, and first released as New Order&#x27;s debut single in 1981. The track and its B-side, &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, were recorded as Joy Division prior to the death of Ian Curtis. Both were re-recorded and carried over to Joy Division&#x27;s re-formation as New Order.

New Order released the song as a single twice, firstly in January 1981 and secondly in September 1981 featuring new member Gillian Gilbert, with the latter recording later appearing on the album &quot;Substance&quot;.

==History==
===Joy Division===
&quot;Ceremony&quot; was one of the last Joy Division songs to be composed, with lyrics written by Ian Curtis. According to guitarist Bernard Sumner, the group wrote the song a few weeks before Ian Curtis died &quot;to try and heal him through music&quot; and keep him &quot;involved in the band and involved in music and remind him of what ... a great future he had&quot;. Sumner concluded, &quot;Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work&quot;. 

At the time, the group felt that the song represented a major step forward and had the potential to be a major hit. Sumner characterised the song as &quot;a very uplifting track, filled with and enhanced by Ian&#x27;s lyrics&quot;. Drummer Stephen Morris, meanwhile, commented, &quot;In my opinion, it had &#x27;hit single&#x27; pressed through it like Blackpool rock. It was probably the only Joy Division song that I played repeatedly on cassette. I liked it that much. It was something uplifting and well...up [in mood]. It felt like the start of something new – or different, at least&quot;.

There are three recorded versions by Joy Division in existence. The first is a live version, available on the &quot;Still&quot; album, from their final concert at High Hall, Birmingham University on 2 May 1980. The second, available on the &quot;Heart and Soul&quot; four-disc box set, is from a studio session on 14 May 1980, four days before Curtis&#x27;s suicide. It was the group&#x27;s last recording. The third is a version recorded at the soundcheck on the afternoon of 2 May 1980 (along with &quot;Decades&quot;) and is only available via bootleg. In all recordings, the vocals are only partially audible.

===New Order===
After the death of Ian Curtis, the remaining members of Joy Division regrouped as New Order. Their first release was a re-recording of &quot;Ceremony&quot; as a stand-alone single backed with &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot;, with guitarist Bernard Sumner taking over lead vocals. Because Curtis had never transcribed the lyrics to &quot;Ceremony&quot; and because his singing was muted to the point of near-inaudibility on all surviving recordings, Sumner said he had to put them through a graphic equalizer to approximate the lyrics.

====New Order &quot;Version 1&quot; March 1981====
On 6 March 1981, the first single of New Order and the first version of the song &quot;Ceremony&quot; was released by Factory Records (with the name FAC 33). Initially released as a 7&quot; single, it was reissued as a 12&quot; two months later. Martin Hannett (Joy Division&#x27;s producer) produced the record and Peter Saville designed the sleeve artwork for both releases.

The 7&quot; record was issued in a stamped gold-bronze sleeve. The 12&quot; sleeve was a completely separate design: gold typography on a green background.

====New Order &quot;Version 2&quot; September 1981====

In September 1981, &quot;Ceremony&quot; was re-released. Gillian Gilbert played guitar on this new recording just after she joined the band. Martin Hannett again produced the record. The single was re-issued as a 12&quot; only, with the same catalogue number (FAC 33). The original is approximately 4:34 minutes in length while the re-recording is 4:23. The re-recorded version was used on all subsequent compilations until &quot;Singles&quot; in 2005, when the original March &#x27;81 recording was released on CD for the first time.

===Re-issue===

The single was re-issued again in April 2011 for Record Store Day in a white sleeve. This limited edition release (only 800 copies) plays at 33 rpm. It features the New Order recordings of &quot;Ceremony&quot; (the pre-Gillian Gilbert take) and &quot;In a Lonely Place&quot; on one side, with the rare Joy Division recordings of the same tracks on the flip side.

<text>Nou (, &quot;nine&quot;), previously known as Canal Nou (&quot;channel nine&quot;), was a Valencian free-to-air public broadcast television channel owned and operated by Radiotelevisió Valenciana (RTVV). It was the corporation&#x27;s flagship channel, featuring general programming mainly in Valencian, with some contents and films in Castilian.

The channel began broadcasting on 9 October 1989 and was closed on 29 November 2013. It was succeeded in 2018 by À Punt.

==History==
==Broadcasting==
Canal Nou could be watched mainly in the Valencian Community. During analogue broadcasting, it reached adjacent areas, especially southern Catalonia, part of Murcia, part of Balearic Islands and the east of Castile–La Mancha. After the digital transition, it was only available in part of Albacete province and Murcia. It was also available in Catalonia following an agreement until July 2010.

==Programming==
The newscasts were divided into three issues of &quot;Notícies Nou&quot; and one in the morning, &quot;Bon Dia Comunitat Valenciana&quot;. It broadcast Valencian fiction series such as &quot;Negocis de Família&quot;, &quot;Les Moreres&quot; or &quot;L&#x27;Alqueria Blanca&quot;. It also broadcasts soap operas, mainly of Mexican and Venezuelan production. Other programmes included &quot;En connexió&quot;, an afternoon news and entertainment programme and football matches of the Valencian First Division teams, as well as the most important sporting events of different Valencian clubs, such as the Pamesa Valencia match of the ULEB Cup. The channel also had the rights to the matches of the Valencian Community football team.

It also had a children&#x27;s space for children called &quot;Babala Club&quot;, a container for animated series.

In prime time, it used to broadcast self-produced programs, series, cinema and thematic programs. It also broadcast the space &quot;Check-in hotel&quot;, a sketch-comedy that had audience shares of up to 30%.

In addition, the channel was very involved with the Valencian festivities, with broadcasts of the Falles de València, as well as broadcasts of the Moors and Christians festivals of the Valencian cities of Ontinyent and Alcoi, the Magdalena Festival, the &quot;Fogueres de Sant Joan&quot; and the Holy Week.

==Closure==
In July 2012, in the middle of the then-ongoing financial crisis, RTVV announced a labor force adjustment plan, firing 1,198 of its 1,660 employees. Trade unions CCOO and CGT challenged the measure, and on 5 November 2013 it was nullified by the National Court. Claiming that reinstating the employees was untenable, the Generalitat Valenciana closed down RTVV that same day.

<text>&quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; is the third single by the English rock band New Order, released in December 1981.

As usual per New Order and Joy Division&#x27;s releases, the recording date and location of the music is not disclosed on the original sleeve. The single was originally released in Belgium on Factory Benelux and bears the catalogue number FBN8. The single was later released in New Zealand in 1982 and was made available in the UK through import copies. The artwork was designed by Peter Saville with computer graphics on the cover designed by Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert.

==Recording and music==
The song had already been released in an edited form, as a double A side with the song &quot;Procession&quot; in September 1981. 

Two original songs, &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and &quot;Mesh&quot;, are included as B-sides. Both have been commonly mistitled on New Order&#x27;s releases. The track names of the B-sides are correctly identified on the label, but are printed in incorrect order on the sleeve. As a result, the songs were misidentified on subsequent releases; for example, the track identified as &quot;Mesh&quot; on the CD version of the &quot;Substance&quot; compilation is actually &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot;. For the 2019 12&quot; single reissue, the tracks are properly labelled on the rear sleeve cover, with &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; listed before &quot;Mesh&quot;.

Stephen Morris wrote the lyrics to &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; and &quot;Mesh,&quot; earning Morris the scorn of critic Julie Burchill (&quot;Sixth form drivel&quot;). The title &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; is taken from the Ingmar Bergman film. Morris later wrote about the origin of the title for &quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green:&quot; &quot;The song&#x27;s title arrived spontaneously as we were programming the rhythm track at Pinky&#x27;s. After a few hours of button stabbing, synth-chattering and drum bashing, I sat down on a rickety chair, rolled a joint and inhaled deeply. The weak sunlight was reflected off the glazing of the swimming baths opposite and diffused through the grease-smeared window of our room. Momentarily, the light seemed to me to take on a crystalline glow, giving the room an aquamarine haze. &#x27;Everything&#x27;s gone Green,&#x27; I observed. &#x27;That&#x27;s good, let&#x27;s call it that then,&#x27; said Bernard, who hadn&#x27;t noticed my Condor moment.&quot; 

All three tracks were produced by Martin Hannett, the last that he would produce with Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris. Hannett, who had previously produced &quot;Movement&quot; and both of Joy Division&#x27;s studio albums, had a fractious relationship with the group, caused by his unorthodox techniques and the band&#x27;s (especially Sumner&#x27;s) desire to co-produce. Sumner remarked retrospectively that &quot;Martin&#x27;s last track was &#x27;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&#x27; – fact he walked out halfway through the mix because Hooky and me asked him to turn the drums up.&quot;

==Availability==
&quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; and &quot;Mesh&quot; were rereleased the following year on the &quot;1981–1982&quot; EP, along with the tracks from the &quot;Temptation&quot; 12&quot;. The single was rereleased as a CD in 1990. All three tracks appeared on the cassette version of &quot;Substance&quot; in 1987 and were in remastered form on the 2008 collector&#x27;s edition of the 1981 album &quot;Movement&quot;.

&quot;Everything&#x27;s Gone Green&quot; appears on many of New Order&#x27;s compilations; aside from &quot;Substance&quot;, the song appears in remixed form (by Dave Clarke) on 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Rest of New Order&quot;, in both its original form and a live recording on 2002&#x27;s &quot;Retro&quot;, in its 7&quot; mix on 2005&#x27;s &quot;Singles&quot; and in its 12&quot; mix on the second disc of the 2008 collector&#x27;s edition re-release of &quot;Movement&quot;.

<text>San Po Kong () is an area in New Kowloon in Hong Kong. It is largely industrial and partly residential. Administratively, it belongs to Wong Tai Sin District.

==Location==
San Po Kong is located south of Wong Tai Sin and Diamond Hill, north of the former Kai Tak International Airport and west of Ngau Chai Wan. The area is bounded by Choi Hung Road and Prince Edward Road East. 

==History==
===Village===
San Po Kong was a new village replacing the old Po Kong Village that was destroyed by the Japanese in 1943. The original village consisted of terraced housing and a small forested area along a hill. The hill was partially levelled by the Japanese during the extension of the runway at Kai Tak during World War II. Today the old village hill is now site of the Choi Hung Road Playground. Reminders of the old village lives on with street names and a park (Po Kong Village Road, Po Kong Village Road Park). The current San Po Kong is a post-War residential scheme with mostly public housing blocks.

===Airport===
In 1916, the area south of present-day San Po Kong was reclaimed by Ho Kai and Au Tak for a garden estate. The reclamation was completed in two phases in 1920 and 1927. The reclaimed area became known as Kai Tak Bund. The company lacked the capital to complete the project and left part the land unused. The Hong Kong Government decided to buy back the land for the Royal Air Force and a future Kai Tak Aerodrome. In the late 1930s, the airport was significantly expanded to take up the whole of San Po Kong. Clear Water Bay Road, part of the current Choi Hung Road, and a nullah were constructed around the airport. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, more than 20 villages surrounding San Po Kong were demolished for further expansion of the airport.

Part of the previous runway was converted into Tseuk Luk Street in the area, which was deliberately named with a pun on the word &quot;landing&quot; in Cantonese.

===Industrial area===

In 1958, the airport was shifted south, out of San Po Kong and into Kowloon Bay. Prince Edward Road East was completed at around this time. San Po Kong became an industrial area, in many high-rise buildings. The government also established the San Po Kong Factory Estate, a factory estate for small manufacturing businesses in the early 1960s.

In May 1967, a labour dispute in a factory making artificial flowers ignited the 1967 riots, which lasted until October. During that period, public bus services were suspended, forcing workers from other areas to commute on foot.

In the 1980s, many of the manufacturing businesses in San Po Kong relocated to China, and the industrial buildings were turned into offices and godowns.

==Features==
Facilities in San Po Kong include:
* Mikiki, a shopping mall
* Choi Hung Road Playground
* Rhythm Garden, a housing estate
* Ho Lap College
* Ng Wah Catholic Secondary School

==Transport==
San Po Kong is served by Wong Tai Sin station, Diamond Hill station and Kai Tak station of the MTR.

==Education==
San Po Kong is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 43. Within the school net are multiple aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) and Wong Tai Sin Government Primary School.

<doc id="1091583" wikidata="Q418203" url="?curid=1091583" title="Dolichol">
<text>Dolichol refers to any of a group of long-chain mostly unsaturated organic compounds that are made up of varying numbers of isoprene units terminating in an α-saturated isoprenoid group, containing an alcohol functional group.

==Functions==
Dolichols play a role in the post-translational modification of proteins known as &quot;N&quot;-glycosylation in the form of dolichol phosphate. Dolichols function as a membrane anchor for the formation of the oligosaccharide Glc3–Man9–GlcNAc2 (where Glc is glucose, Man is mannose, and GlcNAc is &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine). This oligosaccharide is transferred from the dolichol donor onto certain asparagine residues (onto a specific sequence that is &quot;Asn–X–Ser/Thr&quot;) of newly forming polypeptide chains. Dolichol is also involved in transfer of the monosaccharides to the forming Glc3–Man9–GlcNAc2–Dolichol carrier.

In addition, dolichols can be adducted to proteins as a posttranslational modification, a process in which branched carbohydrate trees are formed on a dolichol moiety and then transferred to an assembly of proteins to form a large glycoprotein in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Dolichols are the major lipid component (14% by mass) of human substantia nigra (SN) neuromelanin.
Dolichol phosphate was discovered at the University of Liverpool in the 1960s, although researchers did not know its function at the time of discovery.

==Role in aging==
Dolichol has been suggested to be used as a biomarker for aging. During aging, the human brain shows a progressive increase in levels of dolichol, a reduction in levels of ubiquinone, but relatively unchanged concentrations of cholesterol and dolichyl phosphate. In the neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, the situation is reversed, with decreased levels of dolichol and increased levels of ubiquinone. The concentrations of dolichyl phosphate are also increased, while cholesterol remains unchanged. The isoprenoid changes in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease differ from those occurring during normal aging, and, therefore, this disease cannot be regarded as a result of premature aging. The increase in the sugar carrier dolichyl phosphate may reflect an increased rate of glycosylation in the diseased brain, and the increase in the endogenous anti-oxidant ubiquinone an attempt to protect the brain from oxidative stress, for instance, induced by lipid peroxidation.

==Synthesis==
Dolichol is a product of the HMG-CoA reductase pathway (also known as the mevalonate pathway), and as such their creation and availability are affected by mevalonate inhibition. First, a cis (or Z) -prenyltransferase (Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase in humans) catalyzes the condensation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) with a varying number (dependent on the particular cis-prenyltransferase) of isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) molecules, resulting in the formation of a polyprenyl diphosphate (also known as dehydrodolichyl diphosphate). This subsequently undergoes loss of both phosphate groups, resulting in a polyprenol (dehydrodolichol). Lastly, the α isoprenoid unit is saturated by α-saturase (still a hypothetical enzyme), and this α-saturated polyprenyl alcohol is known as dolichol.

== Other ==
Dolichols are found in eukaryotes and in archaea, although similar polyprenols molecules are found in bacteria. Polyprenols in bacteria do not contain an α-saturated isoprenoid and are typically smaller in terms of isoprenoid units or carbon length. Polyprenols perform similar functions within bacteria; that is, they function as glycosyl carrier lipids involved in formation of complex branched polysaccharide. However, the cellular process they are involved in is not glycosylation, but instead cell wall biosynthesis. Statins decrease dolichol levels in the body.

==Medical significance==
The Australian pharmaceutical company Solagran has been investigating the medical significance of polyprenols and their substitution with dolichols when ingested where there is a deficiency. Trials of Ropren (already pharmaceutically registered as a hepatoprotector) in relation to neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) in both Russia and Australia indicate considerable potential as a safe and effective treatment.

==History==
Isolation of a very long hitherto unknown isoprenoid alcohol was first published in 1960; it was therefore named dolichol, from Ancient Greek (&quot;dolichos&quot;, &quot;long&quot;).

<doc id="1091585" wikidata="Q438051" url="?curid=1091585" title="Ricardo Fuller">
<text>Ricardo Dwayne Fuller (born 31 October 1979) is a retired Jamaican professional footballer who played as a forward.

Fuller started his football career with Jamaican side Tivoli Gardens, before he moved to England with Crystal Palace in February 2001. He returned to Jamaica and then went on loan to Hearts, before joining Preston North End. He scored 27 goals in 58 League game at Preston, which prompted Portsmouth to pay £1 million for his services. Fuller failed to make an impact at Portsmouth and joined rivals Southampton in 2005 before Stoke City signed him for £500,000 in August 2006.

At Stoke, he became an influential member of the first team and his goals helped the &quot;Potters&quot; gain promotion to the Premier League in 2008. He remained a key figure in the top-flight, despite a poor disciplinary record, and helped Stoke reach the 2011 FA Cup Final, but missed out on the final due to injury. After he recovered from his injury he was only given a bit-part role and he left the club in June 2012 for a one-season stay with Charlton Athletic. He spent the 2013–14 season with Blackpool and 2014–15 with Millwall. He joined Oldham Athletic in October 2015.

Fuller played 77 international matches for the Jamaica national team between 1999 and 2012.

==Club career==

===Crystal Palace===
Fuller was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and began his career with Tivoli Gardens. He had a trial with Charlton Athletic, playing in three reserve team matches. He moved to English club Crystal Palace in February 2001 for a possible fee of £1 million (the exact figure being dependent on appearances), after impressing on trial the previous month. At the time of his transfer he was suspended by the Jamaican football authority for kicking a Wadadah player in the head. He suffered from knee problems, and played just eight games for the &quot;Eagles&quot;. He returned to Tivoli at the end of the campaign after failing to settle in London.

Fuller spent the next season 2001–02 on loan at Scottish Premier League club Hearts. He had an instant impact, scoring 8 goals in 27 appearances, and finishing as the club&#x27;s joint top-scorer with Kevin McKenna. However, the Edinburgh-based club could not afford to sign Fuller on a permanent basis.

===Preston North End===
Preston North End stepped in to sign the striker, paying £500,000. Fuller scored on his Preston debut, a 2–1 defeat at home to old club Crystal Palace, and soon became a vital team player. He had an explosive scoring rate, but unfortunately he suffered knee ligament damage in early December, which ended his season prematurely. He had scored 11 goals in only 20 appearances for the club. A fit again Fuller began the 2003–04 season on fire, including a run of six goals in five games, but his form tailed off as his knee troubled him once more. Despite this, he still scored 19 goals that season to become the club&#x27;s top-scorer. Fuller handed in a transfer request in June 2004 to force through a move to a Premiership club.

===Portsmouth===
Both Leeds United and Portsmouth then displayed their interest, however, Fuller&#x27;s knee problems meant both clubs withdrew their offers after he failed medicals. However, Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp was still keen on the Jamaican and Pompey negotiated a &#x27;pay-as-you-play&#x27; deal with Fuller, meaning they would not lose a great deal of money should his recurring knee injuries force him to miss long periods of seasons. Fuller moved to Fratton Park in August 2004 for £1 million, after scoring 31 goals in only 63 appearances for Preston.

Fuller failed to make a huge impact in the Premier League, falling down the pecking order as the season progressed. Despite the sale of some of his fellow strikers at the end of the season, the return from long-term injury by strikers Vincent Péricard and Svetoslav Todorov, and the purchase of Collins Mbesuma, meant Fuller was not guaranteed first team football at Portsmouth and new manager Alain Perrin agreed to let Fuller go. A move to Sunderland fell through when Fuller failed a medical. Instead he was re-united with Harry Redknapp, who signed him for Southampton for £90,000. He scored once in his time at Portsmouth, in a 3–1 win over Crystal Palace.

===Southampton===
His start at Southampton was fairly dramatic, scoring Saints&#x27; only goal at Coventry on 29 August 2005, and scoring again at Derby on 18 September. After that his career at Saints declined. His perceived lack of effort and his history as a former Portsmouth player, combined with the general air of dissatisfaction at St. Mary&#x27;s led to Fuller receiving a considerable amount of abuse from large sections of the home crowd. In February 2006, he went on loan to Ipswich Town, where he had an eventful time. In three games, he scored two goals, collected two yellow cards and one red card in the 2–2 draw at Crystal Palace, for a hand gesture at the crowd. He returned to Southampton at the end of March.

On his return to Southampton, he was a changed player and in the final six games of the season he scored six goals, which won him the Championship Player of the Month award for April. This took his season&#x27;s tally to nine goals, making him the club&#x27;s top-scorer. Despite this, he did not fit into George Burley&#x27;s plans for 2006–07 and was transferred to Stoke City on transfer deadline day, 31 August 2006.

===Stoke City===
Fuller joined Stoke City for a fee of around £500,000, although a significant percentage of the fee depended on the number of appearances that he made for the &quot;Potters&quot;. In his first season at Stoke he was the top goalscorer with 11 goals, but he also had the worst disciplinary record, accumulating two red cards and ten yellow cards.

In the 2007–08 season, Fuller became a vital part of Stoke promotion winning side becoming a firm fan favourite in the process. Fuller missed Stoke&#x27;s home game against Hull City as he was attending the funeral of his grandmother in his home nation of Jamaica. Fuller signed a new contract in December 2007 keeping his contracted at the club until 2011. He scored 15 goals during the 2007–08 season as Stoke won promotion to the Premier League, he also won the club&#x27;s goal of the season award for his solo effort against Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Fuller scored Stoke City&#x27;s first-ever Premier League goal, a late consolation in a 3–1 defeat to Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2008–09 season. He followed this up with another goal in Stoke&#x27;s 3–2 win over Aston Villa in their first ever Premier League home match. This goal won Match of the Day&#x27;s Goal of the Month for August. and also earned the praise from manager Tony Pulis.

Fuller was sent off for violent conduct on 28 December 2008 against West Ham United. Following West Ham&#x27;s equaliser, Fuller argued with team-mate Andy Griffin, before slapping the Stoke captain&#x27;s face. Referee Mike Jones gave Fuller a straight red for violent conduct and West Ham went on to win the match 2–1. Tony Pulis and Stoke teammate Danny Higginbotham commented that the incident would not affect the club. On 1 January 2009, Tony Pulis confirmed that Fuller and Griffin had &quot;kissed and made up&quot; after a team meeting. Fuller said Griffin had been &quot;very rude and disrespectful&quot;, but accepted that his actions had been worse. In a match against Sunderland in February 2009 Fuller dislocated his shoulder and it was feared that he would be out injured for the rest of the season. However Fuller made a quick recovery and was out for just two weeks. He bounced back with lively performances against Aston Villa and a goal against Bolton and continued his form to help Stoke to safety.

After a slow start to the 2009–10 season for Fuller&#x27;s standards, Pulis told the Jamaican he needs to lose weight. He scored 2 goals against Arsenal in the 4th round of the FA Cup in a 3–1 win over Arsenal on 24 January 2010, and also in the next round against Manchester City. Despite not being as prolific in front of goal Fuller won the goal of the season award for the third time in a row with another solo effort this time against West Ham United when he tricked his way past three hammers defenders before slotting past Rob Green.

Fuller scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season against Tottenham Hotspur at the Britannia Stadium. He then dislocated his shoulder for the second time in his Stoke career away at Newcastle United and then suffered a repeat injury in the next away match at Bolton. He made his 150th league appearance for Stoke on 6 November 2010 against Sunderland. Fuller scored his 100th goal in British football on 9 November against Birmingham City with another sole effort. In the January transfer window there was strong rumours that Fuller would be leaving Stoke to join Sunderland. However Sunderland denied that they made a bid for Fuller. Following the 5–0 FA Cup semi-final win over Bolton Wanderers Stoke captain Ryan Shawcross revealed that a speech from Fuller inspired the team. In the next match against Aston Villa Fuller sustained an Achilles tendon injury and missed the rest of the 2010–11 season including the 2011 FA Cup Final.

Fuller made his return from injury against Queens Park Rangers on 19 November 2011. He scored his 50th goal for Stoke against Beşiktaş in the UEFA Europa League in December 2011. He made his first Premier League start for Stoke on 10 March 2012 away at Chelsea, Fuller was sent-off after 24 minutes after stamping on Branislav Ivanović, Stoke went on to lose 1–0. Manager Pulis described Fuller&#x27;s actions as &#x27;ridiculous&#x27;. He left Stoke at the end of the 2011–12 season following the expiration of his contract.

===Later career===
Fuller joined Championship side Charlton Athletic on 22 August 2012 signing a one-year contract, with the option of a further year. Fuller was given the number 19 shirt, and made his debut as a substitute in an away fixture at Nottingham Forest. He scored important goals away at Ipswich Town and Crystal Palace, in addition to a 25-yard strike at home to Peterborough United. Fuller suffered several injuries, but was one of Charlton&#x27;s six goal scorers in a record 6–0 away win at relegation threatened Barnsley. Despite helping Charlton to a ninth-placed finish in their first season back in the second tier of English football since 2009, he was released by Charlton at the end of the 2012–13 season. On 15 August 2013 Fuller signed a one-year contract with Championship club Blackpool with an option of an extra year. He scored six goals in 28 appearances for Blackpool during the 2013–14 season. Fuller joined Millwall on a one-year contract on 16 July 2014. He played 40 times for the Lions scoring six goals as they suffered relegation from the Championship.

Fuller signed a three-month contract with Oldham Athletic on 16 October 2015, following a successful trial. He left Oldham in January 2016. Fuller announced his retirement on 16 May 2016. However, in January 2019, it was announced that Fuller had signed for Nantwich Town. He re-signed for the club in November 2019. Fuller signed for Hanley Town on 31 August 2020. On 22 September, he scored the winner in an FA Cup tie, helping his side to a 3–2 win over Redditch United, which would mark the first time in their history that Hanley had reached the FA Second Qualifying Round.

==International career==
Fuller was a member of the Jamaica Under 20 national team in 1998. He eventually was called up to the senior national team in 1999. Fuller has been involved in Jamaica&#x27;s 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cup campaigns and also featured in the 2005 and 2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup competitions.

==Personal life==
Fuller was raised by his grandmother in the Tivoli Gardens section of Kingston, Jamaica. With his football earnings, Fuller was able to rebuild his grandmother&#x27;s house after it was destroyed in early 2010 due to the riots in Jamaica. Fuller was arrested in February 2009 on suspicion of committing driving offences. He later pleaded guilty to driving without a UK licence and was fined and handed three penalty points. Fuller was arrested in February 2010 on suspicion of assault. He did not face any charges over the incident.

In November 2022, Stoke City renamed their renovated sports bar at the bet365 Stadium Ricardo&#x27;s in honour of Fuller.

<text>Finger knitting is a form of knitting where a knitted cord is created using only hands and fingers, instead of knitting needles or other traditional tools.

==Uses==
Though finger knitting may be performed by people of all ages, it is cited as a teaching tool for children because of its comparative simplicity in contrast to traditional knitting. It effectively demonstrates that knitting involves a series of loops strung together. Finger knitting may also be safely practiced on airplanes that prohibit knitting needles.
==Records==
Several world record attempts have been made with finger knitting. The current record, as acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records, is held by a German man who knitted a strand in 2004. Ten days before the German record was set, 11-year-old Gemma Pouls of Hamilton, New Zealand, set the record with a , which weighed over .

<text>Hoi Sham Island (), also called To Kwa Wan Island (), was an island in Kowloon Bay off the coast of To Kwa Wan, Kowloon Peninsula in Hong Kong. It was connected to the mainland as a consequence of land reclamation, and it is now part of Hoi Sham Park ().

==History==
The island was known by the locals for its distinctive shape of the rocks, some of them were given names, such as Hoi Sham Rock () and Fishtail Rock (), and the island was believed to be a place of good feng shui. A Lung Mo Temple (), also called Hoi Sham Temple (), was originally built on the island at the foot of the rock.

Upon reclamation of the bay of To Kwa Wan in the 1960s, the island was connected to the urban To Kwa Wan area, and was converted into Hoi Sham Park in 1972. The Fishtail Rock and Hoi Sham Rock were preserved and are displayed in the park.

The temple was demolished in 1964 and the statue of Lung Mo () was relocated to the nearby Tin Hau Temple, built in 1885 and located at the corner of Ha Heung Road () and Lok Shan Road (). In this temple, the statue of the Lung Mo is on the altar of the left bay (right side when viewed from the front).

<doc id="1091597" wikidata="Q3051656" url="?curid=1091597" title="Temptation (New Order song)">
<text>&quot;Temptation&quot; is the fourth single released by English band New Order on Factory Records in 1982. Released as the last of a string of stand-alone singles early in the band&#x27;s career, &quot;Temptation&quot; reached number 29 on the UK Singles Chart.

==Original release==

The 7&quot; version is a more structured version with a commercial synthpop feel; the 12&quot; is more chaotic with the emphasis on electronic rhythms rather than melody. The 7&quot; version plays at 33⅓ rpm to accommodate its length of around five and a half minutes. Both versions bear the same catalogue number &quot;FAC 63&quot; despite these differences.

The 12&quot; versions of both &quot;Temptation&quot; and its B-side, &quot;Hurt&quot;, appear on New Order&#x27;s mopping-up EP &quot;1981–1982&quot;, released a few months after the single itself.

Neither version mentioned the band&#x27;s name on the sleeve; instead the song title and catalogue number FAC 63 were embossed into the cover.

The vocal track on the original 12&quot; version features an audible &quot;startled yelp&quot; during the song&#x27;s intro. Vocalist Bernard Sumner has since explained that the scream was from him due to bandmates thrusting a snowball down his shirt during recording.

==Music video==
In 2006 the song was interpreted in a video titled &quot;The Temptation of Victoria&quot; by filmmaker Michael Shamberg, who had directed a number of music videos for New Order. Victoria Bergsman of Swedish band The Concretes acted the role of the protagonist in the video. Set to the song&#x27;s 1987 re-recording the film features a young woman in Paris who steals a vinyl copy of the song&#x27;s original 12-inch release from a vintage record shop (the now defunct Bimbo Tower), along with a bouquet from a flower shop, before returning to her apartment. On arrival home she puts the flowers in a vase and the record on to a player, and begins dancing to its music. At this point the video shifts from black and white to full color, starting with the bouquet before quickly encompassing the whole scene. The film plays out with her dancing alone, absorbed in the rhythm of the music.

The storyline of the video may refer to Ian Curtis, the late frontman/singer of Joy Division, New Order&#x27;s previous formation, who used to shoplift records. The video is dedicated to the memory of the film director Michael Powell.

<doc id="1091598" wikidata="Q707351" url="?curid=1091598" title="Lighthouse Family">
<text>Lighthouse Family were a British pop soul duo that rose to prominence in the mid-1990s and initially remained active until the early 2000s. Singer Tunde Baiyewu and songwriter Paul Tucker formed the act in 1993 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, after meeting while studying at university and both working at the same bar. Their 1995 debut album &quot;Ocean Drive&quot; sold more than 1.8 million copies in the UK alone and established them as a popular easy listening duo throughout Europe. 

They are best known for their worldwide hit &quot;High&quot;, which peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and topped the charts in Australia. Other well-known songs include &quot;Goodbye Heartbreak&quot;, &quot;Lifted&quot;, &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Ocean Drive&quot; and &quot;Raincloud&quot;. The duo&#x27;s first studio album in 18 years, &quot;Blue Sky in Your Head&quot;, was released on 5 July 2019.

==Career==
===Formation and record deal===

Both Baiyewu and Tucker were working in bars when they first met; together, they recorded demos of a number of songs Tucker had written during the late 1980s. Among these, a demo of &quot;Ocean Drive&quot; attracted the attention of Polydor Records A&amp;R director Colin Barlow, who, in 1993, signed the band to a six-month development deal.

In the wake of an economic recession in the United Kingdom, British record labels were, at the time, primarily signing artists with the goal of short-term profit. In contrast, Barlow, in &quot;The Times&quot;, expected that the band could last for &quot;ten years or more&quot;. At the time of the launch of the first album, Polydor&#x27;s investments in the band totaled £250,000. Producer Mike Peden&#x27;s hiring was described as a &quot;big spend&quot;, and music videos were filmed overseas in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.

===Commercial success===
The lead single, &quot;Lifted&quot;, received airplay on BBC Radio One as well as a number of BBC Local Radio stations, and &quot;The Chart Show&quot; aired its music video. Still, this did not translate to considerable single or album sales within 1995; it was not until &quot;Lifted&quot; was re-released in 1996 that it reached the top five on the UK Singles Chart, and &quot;Ocean Drive&quot;, which had been deleted, rebounded and was certified six-times platinum by the end of 1997, spending 154 weeks on the UK Albums Chart in the process. Its follow-up &quot;Postcards from Heaven&quot; achieved similar sales status in 1997. It featured the hit single &quot;High&quot; (number four in the UK) with the music video filmed in North East England and featuring Newcastle&#x27;s Tyne Bridge.

Lighthouse Family scaled down their appearances in early 2003 because of what they called a &quot;heavy promotional schedule&quot; following the release of &quot;Whatever Gets You Through the Day&quot; in 2001. This led to both men pursuing individual projects. Baiyewu became a solo artist, while Tucker joined a rock band, The Orange Lights.

===Comeback===
In November 2010, the duo announced they were reforming Lighthouse Family and did a full UK and Ireland tour, in February and March 2011. It was the first performance of Lighthouse Family in eight years. During an interview on breakfast TV show &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; on 17 January 2011, Lighthouse Family revealed they had still been talking to each other during their time away, and that there was no current defined timescale for the release of a new album. However, Tucker mentioned during the interview that the duo had &quot;pockets... full of songs&quot;.
The duo had planned to release a new album called &quot;Blue Sky in Your Head&quot; on 3 May 2019, introduced by the single, &quot;My Salvation&quot;, on 21 March; however, the album release was delayed until 5 July 2019. &quot;Blue Sky in Your Head&quot; is their first album in 18 years. Lighthouse Family announced a multi-date UK tour commencing in November 2019. The album was supported with two sell-out UK tours.

Tucker announced in June 2022 that the duo would no longer be performing together, as Baiyewu wished to focus on his solo career.

<text>Lumsden () is a town in Southland, New Zealand. Lying in a gap in the surrounding hills, Lumsden is the location of a major junction on State Highway 6. Lumsden is 81 kilometres north of Invercargill, 106 kilometres south of Queenstown, 59 kilometres west of Gore and 77 kilometres east of Te Anau. The Ōreti River is located 1.5 kilometres east of the town.

==History==
Originally the district in general was known as The Elbow. When this name was given to the then new railway station, residents of Castlerock, then also known as The Elbow and on the opposite bank of the Ōreti River, brought the matter to George Lumsden of the Otago Provincial Council. He referred that matter to the Railways Department who, in the absence of any other suggestion, chose the name Lumsden for the town.

In 2017, it was suggested that Lumsden is becoming a satellite town for Queenstown, despite the commuting distance. It was much cheaper to buy or rent a house in Lumsden and work in Queenstown where wages are potentially higher.

The Lumsden Presbyterian church, which was built in 1891, was decommissioned in 2022. It was purchased and moved to Rangiora with plans to convert it into a house. The historic church and surrounding trees were observed to remain on site in mid August 2023.

==Railways==

Lumsden also used to be a major railway junction with lines departing to all four points of the compass. The Kingston Branch from Invercargill ran north–south through the town, while to the west was the Mossburn Branch and to the east was the Waimea Plains Railway that connected with the Main South Line in Gore. In 1971, most of the Waimea Plains Railway closed, but sixteen kilometres from Lumsden to Balfour remained open until 1978. In 1979, the line north to Kingston was closed after repairs to flood damage would not have been economic, and both the Mossburn Branch and the connection south to Invercargill closed in December 1982.

The railway station is now preserved as a tourist information centre. The Lumsden Heritage Trust, formed in 2013 has recovered and restored original carriages and trains. It has displayed the chassis of New Zealand Railways steam locomotive P 60 at the town&#x27;s southern entrance, as well as two unrestored locomotives, V 126 and V 127, two Drewry diesel shunters and three wagons by the old station, to commemorate its former prominent status in New Zealand&#x27;s national rail network. In April 2022 a historic 1883 A Class 199 elevated roof passenger carriage was added to the Lumsden Railway precinct.

<doc id="1091606" wikidata="Q968235" url="?curid=1091606" title="Arjan de Zeeuw">
<text>Adrianus Johannes &quot;Arjan&quot; de Zeeuw (born 16 April 1970) is a Dutch former professional footballer who played as a centre-back.

Having begun his career with Telstar before going on to spend the bulk of his career in England. He notably played in the Premier League for both Barnsley and Portsmouth and was part of teams promotions to the top flight in 1997 and 2003. He also played top flight football for Wigan Athletic during his second spell with the club, as well as playing in the Football League for Coventry City. He retired in 2009 following a brief spell back in the Netherlands with ADO &#x27;20.

==Club career==
Born in Castricum, North Holland, De Zeeuw started his career at Vitesse &#x27;22 in the Dutch amateur leagues, and studied for a degree in medical science whilst playing for the club. At the age of 22, he turned professional and signed for Telstar in the Eerste Divisie. In 1995, he considered quitting football after he felt Telstar had priced him out of a move to Eredivisie side Utrecht, but decided to stay with the club for one more year.

De Zeeuw was approached by Barnsley later that year, who signed him for a fee of £250,000 during the 1995–96 season. In December 1995, he scored his first goal in English football in a 2–2 draw against Ipswich Town. He was a key player in the side that won promotion to the Premier League in the 1996–97 season. The club were relegated the following year, and it appeared that De Zeeuw was set to leave the club in the summer after turning down a new contract, but was later persuaded by new manager John Hendrie to sign a one-year deal. When his contract expired at the end of the 1998–99 season, he moved to Wigan Athletic.

At Wigan he soon became a vital team member, proving to be highly dependable at the back, and received the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award in 2001 and 2002. His contract with Wigan expired in the summer of 2002, and the following season, he moved on a free transfer to Portsmouth. He was an integral part of the Portsmouth squad that claimed the First Division championship.

He continued to perform to high standards as Portsmouth played well in their debut FA Premier League season, and was recognised by the fans who voted him Portsmouth Player of the Year. He was rewarded with the captaincy for the 2004–05 season, following Teddy Sheringham&#x27;s departure to West Ham United, and led the team to stave off relegation following the departure of manager Harry Redknapp.

In the summer 2005, after falling out with then-Portsmouth manager Alain Perrin, he returned to Wigan Athletic for the nominal fee of £90,000. De Zeeuw, who is now advanced in years for the life of a footballer, wanted the guarantee of first-team football which Perrin was unwilling to provide. The majority of Portsmouth supporters lamented this decision and loss of their former captain, who had a very consistent season with Wigan at the heart of their defence, helping them to a better-than-expected mid-table finish and even received praise from then Prime Minister Tony Blair.

De Zeeuw is considered by many to be an excellent example of professionalism in the modern game. He refused to retaliate after El Hadji Diouf spat in his face during a match at the Reebok Stadium in November 2004. His response was to score the winning goal in Portsmouth&#x27;s 1–0 victory.

In Wigan&#x27;s second Premiership season, he struggled to get a regular first team place due to a series of injuries and was released by the club on 17 May 2007. Whilst at Wigan he started in the 2006 Football League Cup Final. In a poll to celebrate the centenary of the Professional Footballers&#x27; Association fans voted De Zeeuw to be the best player of all time for Wigan Athletic.

In June 2007, it was announced that De Zeeuw had signed a one-year contract with Coventry City. During pre-season training, a freak accident left the defender sidelined for 6 to 8 weeks. He made his debut against Bristol City on 15 September 2007. It was announced towards the end of the 2007–08 season that De Zeeuw would be one of eight first team players whose contracts would not be renewed. His season was hampered by injury and lack of form leading to new manager Chis Coleman decided he was surplus to requirements.

In 2009, he signed with ADO&#x27;20.

==Personal life==
Following his retirement in 2009, De Zeeuw began working as an investigative detective in Alkmaar, specialising in forensics.

<doc id="1091610" wikidata="Q3685564" url="?curid=1091610" title="Virtual community of practice">
<text>An online community of practice (OCoP), also known as a virtual community of practice (VCoP), is a community of practice (CoP) that is developed and maintained on the Internet. OCoPs include active members who are practitioners, or &quot;experts,&quot; in the specific domain of interest. Members participate in a process of collective learning within their domain. Community social structures are created to assist in knowledge creation and sharing, which is negotiated within an appropriate context. Community members learn through both instruction-based learning and group discourse. Finally, multiple dimensions facilitate the long-term management of support and the ability for synchronous interactions.

To some, a VCoP is a misnomer because the original concept of a CoP was based around situated learning in a co-located setting. With increasing globalization and the growth of the Internet, many now claim that virtual CoPs exist. For example, some claim that a wiki (such as Wikipedia) is a virtual CoP, whereas others argue that the essence of a community is place-based – a community of place.

There is also debate on the term VCoP because the form of communication is largely computer-mediated. Few believe that a community of practice may be formed without face-to-face meetings, with many leading CoP researchers stressing the importance of in-person meetings. However, some researchers argue that a VCoP&#x27;s high use of community technology changes some of its characteristics and introduces new complexities and ambiguities, thus justifying the term VCoP and its area of study.

Other similar terms include: online, computer-mediated, electronic and distributed. As the mode of communication can involve face-to-face, telephone and letter, and the defining feature is its distributed nature. Virtual Learning Communities (VLCs) are distinct from Distributed Communities of Practice (DCoP).

Research suggests that increases in the sharing of tacit knowledge, which occurs within communities of practice, may take place in VCoPs, albeit to a lesser degree.

== Online communities of practice ==

Communities of practice involve a group of people with shared interests or goals who participate within the community. Online communities of practice can include affinity groups or forums. Community members provide and function as resources for new members by supporting new members in developing and participating in shared activities.

Some researchers argue that virtual communities necessitate a different conceptualization of community, and that technology stewardship is a key element of virtual communities of practice by making virtual communities independent of any one technology.

== Current research ==
Research suggests that through extended connections, reflections, and online discourse, OCoPs can support the growth of a collective community identity. OCoPs provide a virtual space for people who might otherwise never meet, in which they can collaborate and participate in shared activities related to the group&#x27;s interests and goals. Additionally, people who are engaged in emergent and uncommon practices, or who have few local resources may have a lower barrier of entry for becoming members of online communities. By participating in community practices, both experienced and novice practitioners can learn together and as a community, which also shapes the personal identities of the members and the group&#x27;s collective identity. Virtual Communities of Practice may be especially effective for increasing teacher efficacy and reducing professional isolation in computer science education.

Some questions remain as to what level of participation in an online community constitutes legitimate membership of an OCoP. Two types of participation have been identified to distinguish between levels of activity. Active participation means that members regularly contribute to community discourse. Peripheral participation, also called “lurking,” means that members read without contributing. Some studies have concluded that some degree of peripheral participation is expected in online communities. Though these members may not contribute to the community discourse, they nevertheless learn from observing, which some researchers would characterize as legitimate membership. Some researchers raise concerns that peripheral participation can threaten an OCoP if more members lurk than actively participate.

== Social networking ==
Web 2.0 applications and social networks have increased the ease by which OCoPs are created and maintained.

The structural characteristics of a community of practice include a shared domain of interest, a notion of community, and members who are also practitioners. While Internet applications may incorporate one of these characteristics, they may not support a full community in practice.

Social networks allow for the creation of clearly defined domains of interest in which the interactions between people can support communities with common and recorded histories. Social network tools allow members of OCoPs to create and share knowledge and develop cultural historical processes.

== Advantages ==
An online community of practice enables participants to read, submit and receive feedback from the community. Peripheral participants (lurkers) can still develop the knowledge and skills from communal resources that are necessary for novice practitioners. Veteran community members support novices, resulting in an atmosphere of mentorship. As new practitioners develop their understanding and expertise, they can participate in expanding the community&#x27;s field of knowledge.

The asynchronous nature of many online forums (e.g. blogs, wikis) allows participants to be involved at their convenience. The forums maintain a record of ideas, discourse and resources, creating an archive of expertise for a field of practice that can be accessed at any time from nearly anywhere.

Professionals who work alone or are the only person from their field of practice in a work setting have indicated a reduced sense of isolation after participating in an OCoP. The contributions of the group help identify characteristics of a practitioner, resulting in both a sense of the overall community&#x27;s identity and the individual&#x27;s identity within the group.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Organizational Impact ===
Establishing a VCoP within an existing organization may disrupt the organization&#x27;s social, cultural, and political systems through questioning. Change management strategies might mitigate this disruption through different stages of a VCoP&#x27;s development.

=== Technology ===
A common hindrance to participation in online communities of practice is the required technology. Members who lack access to computers, PDAs or similar web-accessing technology are precluded from participating in an OCoP. Members with slow or unreliable equipment are unable to participate to their full potential and may find the technical difficulties so discouraging they withdraw completely. Likewise, the technical aptitude required to participate online can be daunting to individuals unfamiliar with the software or platform being used.

=== Forums ===
The lack of physical identification and body language in text-only forums can make it difficult to foster meaningful connections between members. Without a sense of connectivity with other practitioners, involvement may falter. Moderators of an OCoP forum may strengthen the OCoP through activities, events, and occasions in order to promote involvement. Individuals who return after a period of non-participation may feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the amount of new information and posts.

=== Diversity of participants ===
The varying levels of knowledge, skill and experience within an OCoP can deter less confident members from participating in the community. The diverse nature of a community can also create linguistic and cultural barriers to participation. Discourse and jargon can create confusion and misunderstanding, and clarifying communication errors online can prove difficult.

== Examples of online collaborative tools ==
Online tools are the means for collaboration between individuals who may be located across the globe. They may include online tools specifically developed to address the needs of communities of practice or other types of tools used for OCoPs.

=== Social networking sites ===
The first social network site (SNS), SixDegrees.com, was created in 1997. Examples of social networking sites include:
* LinkedIn
* Facebook
* MySpace

=== Virtual worlds ===
Virtual worlds, which are online community-based environments, are being used in both educational and professional settings. In education, these virtual worlds are used to communicate information and allow for face-to-face virtual interaction between students and teachers. They also allow students to use resources provided by the teacher in both the physical and virtual classroom. In professional environments, virtual training provides virtual visits to company locations, as well as flexible training that can be converted from in-person classroom to online virtual content. Virtual worlds provide training simulations for what could otherwise be hazardous situations.

Companies are using virtual worlds to exchange information and ideas. In addition, virtual worlds are used for technical support and business improvements. Case studies document how virtual worlds provide teamwork and training simulations that otherwise be inaccessible. Examples of virtual worlds include:
* Second Life
* Whyville

=== Information sharing ===
Online tools are available for sharing information, which can be used to communicate thoughts or ideas, and provide a setting necessary for collaborative knowledge building. Activities associated with these tools can be integrated into the presentation of online classroom and/or training materials.

Examples of tools for information sharing include:
* Wikis
* Google Docs
* Blogs

===Decision making===
Online tools and platforms can also support deliberation and voting. These may be used by political organizations such as Podemos. Examples of tools and platforms include:
* Loomio
* Reddit
* Appgree
* Agora Voting

<text>Bagnères-de-Bigorre (, literally &quot;Bagnères of Bigorre&quot;; ) is a commune and subprefecture of the Hautes-Pyrénées Department in the Occitanie region of southwestern France.

==Name==
The town was known in antiquity as (Latin for &quot;watery neighborhood&quot;) and in the Middle Ages as (&quot;Waters of the Comminges&quot;). Its present name similarly means &quot;Baths&quot; () of Bigorre, the area of southwestern France once inhabited by the &quot;&quot; and now forming most of the department of Hautes-Pyrénées. Either Bagnères-de-Bigorre or nearby Cieutat was apparently the &quot;Begorra&quot; attested in AD 400, which also derived from the ancient tribe.

==Heraldry==
==Geography==

===Location===
Bagnères-de-Bigorre is located in the foothills of the Pyrenees partly in the valley of the Adour some southeast of Tarbes and east of Lourdes.

===Hydrography===

The Adour river flows through the north-east of the commune and the town flowing towards the north to eventually flow into the Atlantic Ocean at Bayonne. Numerous streams flow through the commune including the&quot; GaiVeste&quot; which forms the northern border as it flows north-east to join the Adour, the &quot;Oussouet&quot; which forms part of the western border as it flows north, the &quot;Ardazen&quot; which forms part of the eastern border as it flows east to join the &quot;Angoue&quot;, the &quot;Quartier par d&#x27;Abay&quot; which also forms part of the eastern border as it flows north-east gathering numerous tributaries, the &quot;Lhécou&quot; flows north from &quot;Lac Bleu&quot; just south of the commune to join the Quartier par d&#x27;Abay, the &quot;Garet&quot; forms part of the south-eastern border as it flows north from several lakes in the south of the commune (Lac de Caderolles, Lac de Gréziolles), the &quot;Adour d&#x27;Arizes&quot; flows south-east, and the &quot;Adour du Tourmalet&quot; flows east then north-east through the south of the commune, the hamlet of La Mongie and the Castillon Dam, to join the Adour d&#x27;Arizes forming the &quot;Adour de Gripp&quot;.
===Climate===
Bagneres-de-Bigorre is relatively untouched by the west by south-west disturbances which blow out before the high border mountain range. It is however intensely exposed to north by north-west disturbances that collide with the terrain. This barrier effect is felt up to the foothills so that springs, autumns, and winters are cool and rainy while summers are often hot and particularly stormy.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Bigorre was conquered by the Roman general Julius Caesar in 56 BCE and incorporated into the province of Gallia Aquitania. Valerius Messala stamped out the last pockets of tribal resistance in 28 BC at a victory over the Campani on a hill in Pouzac. The Romans subsequently settled and greatly frequented Vicus Aquensis&#x27;s natural springs. At its greatest extent, the Roman vicus covered about half as much area as the present community. In the 4th-century reforms, the area around Vicus Aquensis became Aquitania Tertia or Novempopulana. It was sacked by the Visigoths amid the Barbarian Invasions.

===Middle Ages===
The Visigoths in the area were displaced by the Franks following their defeat at the AD 507 Battle of Vouillé, but there are no documents or remains from the area to provide guidance on local history until 1171. Archaeologists have proposed that the city was destroyed at some point by an earthquake and abandoned following a plague outbreak in 580.

The area had recovered by 1171, when , count of Bigorre, granted &quot;Aquae Convenarum&quot; a liberal charter. The bill of rights and franchises lists four villages in the area protected by ramparts. By 1313, 800 &quot;fires&quot; (i.e., taxable homesteads) were recorded, making Bagnères as large as Tarbes, the county seat. The town was a place of manufacture and trade, with only 40% directly involved in agriculture. Mills were erected on widened canals fed by the Adour; in addition to grinding wheat, they were used to stamp cauldrons, forge scythes, and tanning hides. The Black Death reached the town in 1348. Amid the Hundred Years&#x27; War, the town fell into English possession in 1360 before suffering a second outbreak of plague the following year. Henri de Trastámara, an ally of the French king, plundered, ransomed, and razed the town in 1427. Two years later there were no more than 291 &quot;fires&quot; in Bagnères, although the town slowly repopulated.

===Renaissance===
The town became even more commercial. In 1551, King of Navarre reformed the town&#x27;s government, replacing its six consuls indirectly elected by a general assembly of the locals with a larger council of 40.

The area&#x27;s natural springs again rose to national prominence under Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, who became queen of Navarre and countess of Bigorre upon her father Henry&#x27;s death in 1555. She frequented the baths, prompting many other prominent visitors to follow.

Already badly disposed towards Catherine de&#x27; Medici, queen regent of France, Jeanne converted to Calvinism on Christmas Day, 1560. She began attempting to impose the Reformation on her domains the following year. As the people of Bagnères remained largely Catholic, following the onset of the French Wars of Religion after the Massacre of Vassy, arrests for heresy began in 1562. While the Count of Montgomery was recovering Béarn from Catherine&#x27;s allies in 1569, he went on to demand large ransoms from her other towns, including Bagnères. (It is unrecorded whether the people of Bagnères paid him, but he is recorded leaving the town unmolested and leaving for Gers.) The governor of Bagnères Antoine Beaudéan was killed by the Protestant warlord Lizier in an ambush near Pouzac in 1574. By the end of the Wars of Religion, the town was ruined. Plague also returned in 1588. The outbreak ended following a religious procession prompted by the &quot;Lighting of the Liloye&quot;, a Marian apparition at the Chapel of Notre-Dame-de-Médous.

The ascension of Jeanne&#x27;s son Henry as king of France in 1589 united his titles—including count of Bigorre—with the French monarchy.

===Early Modern era===

The plague struck Bagnères again in 1628, 1653, and 1654. Public health measures were taken, with most patients isolated in the Salut Valley. The disease did not reappear after December 1654.

On 21 June 1660, strong earthquakes hit the town, continuing for three weeks. Only seven people were killed, but 150 houses were damaged and the springs initially dried up. This was only temporary, however, and the water flowed again sometime later. Reconstruction was carried out with dimension stones from the Salut Quarry. This stone has the distinction of becoming like marble once polished, a feature that characterized the architecture of the town afterwards.

Hydrotherapy was gaining importance. There were 25 private businesses by 1787. In 1775, a convent building was transformed into a gambling establishment called the &quot;Vaux-Hall&quot; where there was also dining and dancing. This is the first casino in Bagnères.

===French Revolution===

During the French Revolution, &quot;moderate suspects&quot; took refuge in the city from 1789 to 1793, ready to flee to Spain if the situation worsened. The departmental authorities were wary of the Bagnèrese, to whom they ascribed little civic or revolutionary spirit. In late 1793, before the hospitals in the southwest became saturated, the wounded were evacuated to spas. At Bagnères, the Saint Barthelemy Hospice, the Uzer and Lanzac houses, and the Hospice of the Médous Capuchins were used as military hospitals.

===Industrialization===
In the 19th century, the hydrotherapy offered by Bagnères&#x27;s spas was reckoned particularly effective for digestive complaints but the private spas were growing more decrepit. In response, the municipality organized the construction of a Grand Thermal Spa (the &quot;Thermes&quot;), which was completed in 1828. By the 1870s, the tourists would double the town&#x27;s population of during the &quot;season&quot;, which ran from May until about the end of October. The casino also opened its own spa, the &quot;Néothermes&quot;.

The supply of marble became a pillar of the local economy, with the expansion of the Géruzet marble works making it one of the largest in France from 1829 to 1880. In the 1870s, the industry employed a thousand people. Slate was also quarried. Dominique Soulé expanded his business from an old mill purchased in 1862, the same year the town was connected to the Midi Railway. The town also produced woolen and worsted cloth, leather, pottery, and toys. A local specialty was barège, a light fabric of mixed silk and wool.

The demolition of the city&#x27;s walls allowed the completion of ring roads around the town, and the town was the site of tribunals of first instance and of commerce.

===20th century===
The town&#x27;s population had declined to around 7000 at the onset of the First World War, which resulted in the expansion of industry in Bagnères, particularly in the field of railway rolling stock. The marble industry collapsed but mechanical and textile industries replaced it. The share of hydrotherapy in the economy also decreased. In June 1944, during the Second World War, a punitive expedition of a company of SS murdered 32 in the town and hundreds more in the valley in retaliation against the actions of the resistance in the region.

The postwar period saw rapid urban growth, particularly in the 1960s. Rural areas of the commune disappeared. The territory was occupied by dwellings to the borders of the neighbouring communes of Gerde and Pouzac which also become urban.

At the end of the 20th century industrial activity decreased. The thermal spa guests were always present and new jobs were created by the implementation of the regional Centre for Reeducation and Rehabilitation, a large retirement home, and a nursing home.

<text>George Davys (1780–1864) was an English cleric, tutor to Queen Victoria, and later Bishop of Peterborough. He was previously Dean of Chester. He himself was educated at Loughborough Grammar School, where a house is named after him.

==Life==
The son of John Davys of Rempstone, Nottinghamshire, by Sophia, daughter of the Rev. B. Wigley of Sawley, Derbyshire, was born at Loughborough, Leicestershire, 1 October 1780. In 1799 he entered as a sizar at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and came out tenth wrangler in 1803. He was elected a Fellow of his college 14 January 1806, and in the same year proceeded M.A.

Davys became curate, first of Littlebury, Essex, then of Chesterford to 1817, and afterwards of Swaffham Prior. In 1811 he was presented on his own petition to the vicarage of Willoughby-on-the-Wolds, Lincolnshire, which he held until 1829. 

The education of Princess Victoria having been entrusted to his care by her mother Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent, Davys took up residence at Kensington Palace in 1827, and filled the position of principal master to the princess until the death of William IV. In April 1829 he was presented by the crown to the rectory of Allhallows-on-the-Wall, London, which he continued to hold until his elevation to the episcopal bench. 

Davys was appointed dean of Chester 10 January 1831, and at the following commencement at Cambridge was created D.D. On 7 May 1839 he was advanced to the bishopric of Peterborough, and was consecrated on 16 June. An evangelical, he took no active part either in religious controversy or in politics. He died of bronchitis at the Palace, Peterborough, 18 April 1864, and was buried in the graveyard of the cathedral on 23 April.

==Works==
Davys wrote, with charges and sermons: 

* &quot;Village Conversations on the Liturgy of the Church of England&quot;, 1820; 8th ed. 1829. 
* &quot;Village Conversations on the principal Offices of the Church&quot;, 1824; another ed. 1849. 
* &quot;A Village Conversation on the Catechism of the Church of England&quot;, printed in Religious Tracts of Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, vol. iii. 1836. 
* &quot;Letters between a Father and his Son on the Roman History and other subjects&quot;, 1848. 
* &quot;A Plain and Short History of England in Letters from a Father to his Son&quot;, 1870.

He also compiled educational works, which appeared from time to time anonymously in the &quot;Cottagers&#x27; Monthly Visitor&quot;, the &quot;National Church Magazine&quot;, and elsewhere. 

==Family==
Davys married in 1814 Marianne, daughter of the Rev. Edmund Mapletoft, rector of Anstye, Hertfordshire. She died at the Palace, Peterborough, 14 December 1858, aged 69.

<text>Go is a 2001 Japanese coming-of-age romantic drama film directed by Isao Yukisada, based on Kazuki Kaneshiro&#x27;s novel of the same title, which tells the story of a Japanese-born North Korean teenager and a prejudiced Japanese girl whom he falls for.

It was Japan&#x27;s official submission for Best Foreign Language Film at the 74th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.

==Plot==
Third-generation Korean, Sugihara, is a student at a Japanese high school after graduating from a North Korean junior high school in Japan. His father runs a back-alley shop that specializes in exchanging pachinko-earned goods for cash, which is stereotypically a &quot;common&quot; Zainichi occupation. His father had long supported North Korea, but he obtained South Korean nationality to go sightseeing in Hawaii, which required a South Korean passport.

Sugihara&#x27;s school days are filled with fights that always result in his victory; he and his delinquent peers fill the rest of their time with all kinds of mischief. His best friend, Jong-Il, is a Korean high-school student who had been his classmate in junior high. When Sugihara decided to leave Korean schools for a Japanese high school, their classroom teacher called him a traitor to their homeland. However, Jong-Il supported Sugihara by saying: “We never have had what you call homeland.”

One day, Sugihara attends the birthday party of one of his friends and meets a mysterious Japanese girl whose family name is Sakurai (she is reluctant to use her first name). He takes her out on a couple of dates and they gradually become intimate. However, tragedy strikes when Jong-Il is stabbed to death by a Japanese youth at a railway station. Jong-Il mistakenly thought that the youth was about to attack a female Korean student at the station. The boy, who is carrying a knife, attacks and kills Jong-Il. Sakurai comforts Sugihara, and that night they attempt to make love. She freezes in bed, however, when Sugihara confesses that he is Korean. She declares that she is afraid of a non-Japanese male entering her, and Sugihara leaves.

In the meantime, Sugihara&#x27;s father has been depressed by the news that his younger brother died in North Korea. In an attempt to provoke him, Sugihara blames his father, stating that the second generation of Zainichi, with its sentimentality and powerlessness, has caused the Zainichi much grief and difficulty. They fistfight, and the result is Sugihara&#x27;s complete defeat. In the wake of the fight, Sugihara finds out that the true reason for his father&#x27;s adopting South Korean nationality was that he wanted to make his son&#x27;s life easier.

Six months later, on Christmas Eve, Sugihara is studying hard in preparation for the college entrance examinations. He is trying to fulfill the wishes of the deceased Jong-Il, who always wanted him to go to a (presumably Japanese) university. Sakurai calls him after a long period of silence between them and asks him to come to the place where they had their first date. In this last scene, they recover mutual affection and leave for some unknown place together in a light snowfall.

==Production==

The film is based on a novel by Kazuki Kaneshiro, a Zainichi Korean himself, also entitled &quot;Go&quot;. It was published in 2000 by Kodansha, and received a Naoki Prize.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
The film received a simultaneous theatrical release in Japan and South Korea, and was the first joint Japanese and South Korean production. It was also the first major film to challenge existing preconceptions about Japanese identity within the commercial format of a young adult romance film. The film explores not just the issue of prejudice, reflected in Sakurai&#x27;s unconscious racism, but that of racial identity in general.

The film has received some criticism for its focus on racism that its protagonist experiences, in comparison to the deeply ingrained and institutionalized racism, ensuring that even after several generations of residence, many Koreans are still refused Japanese passports.

===Awards===

<doc id="1091626" wikidata="Q2599957" url="?curid=1091626" title="Confusion (New Order song)">
<text>&quot;Confusion&quot; is the sixth single by British group New Order, originally released in August 1983 on Factory Records with the catalogue number FAC 93. The follow-up to their breakthrough hit &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, it was produced and co-written by influential New York DJ Arthur Baker, charting at No. 1 on the UK Indie Chart, No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart and the top 10 in Ireland and New Zealand, as well as reaching No. 5 
on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance Club Songs.

==Content==
The song was recorded in New York with producer Arthur Baker. Three remixes served as B-sides on the initial 12&quot; release: &quot;Confused Beats&quot;, &quot;Confusion Instrumental&quot; and &quot;Confusion Rough Mix&quot;. The two tracks on side A (&quot;Confusion&quot; and &quot;Confused Beats&quot;) are mixed together, which when played in sequence, act as a thirteen and half minute long remix by Arthur Baker. The &quot;Rough Mix&quot; on side B is the original song mixed by New Order.

==Music video==
The video for the single features live footage of the band in concert, intercut with images of nightlife in New York City, specifically at the &quot;Fun House&quot;, and producer Arthur Baker and DJ John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez at work.

==Other versions==
An edit of the Rough Mix represents the single on the 2005 compilation &quot;Singles&quot;. A re-recorded &quot;Confusion&quot; as well as the original &quot;Confusion Instrumental&quot; appear on the group&#x27;s 1987 &quot;Substance&quot; release. The track reappeared on the 1995 remix collection &quot;The Rest of New Order&quot; as an acid techno remix by Pump Panel, which was used in 1998 as part of the soundtrack for the film &quot;Blade&quot;. Samples from The Pump Panel remix are featured on the tracks &quot;Operation Blade (Bass in the Place)&quot; by Public Domain, &quot;Play It Louder&quot; by Randy Katana and &quot;Phatt Bass&quot; by Warp Bros and Aquagen. The 2016 re-release of &quot;Singles&quot; includes the promo 7&quot; edit of &quot;Confusion&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Considered a disappointing follow-up to &quot;Blue Monday&quot; upon its release, the song has retrospectively gained critical acclaim.

<doc id="1091629" wikidata="Q5165990" url="?curid=1091629" title="Ghostbusters (1984 video game)">
<text>Ghostbusters is a licensed game by Activision based on the film of the same name. It was designed by David Crane and released for several home computer platforms in 1984, and later for video game console systems, including the Atari 2600, Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System. The primary target was the Commodore 64 and the programmer for the initial version of the game was Adam Bellin. All versions of the game were released in the USA except for the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions, which were released only in Europe, and the MSX version, which was released only in Europe, South America, and Japan.

In 1984, after the film &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; had been launched, John Dolgen VP of Business Development at Columbia Pictures approached Activision International president Gregory Fischbach and offered to license the game rights to Activision without specific rules or requests for the design or content of the game, only stipulating that it was to be finished as quickly as possible in order to be released while the movie was at peak popularity. Activision was forced to complete the programming work in only six weeks in contrast to their usual several months of development time for a game. Activision had at the time a rough concept for a driving/maze game to be called &quot;Car Wars&quot;, and it was decided to build the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; game from it. Both the movie and the game proved to be huge successes with the game selling over two million copies by 1989.

== Gameplay ==
The player sets up a Ghostbusters franchise in a city whose psychokinetic (PK) energy levels have begun to rise. At the start of the game, the player is given a set amount of money and must use it to buy a vehicle and equipment for detecting and catching ghosts. They must then move through a grid representing the city, with flashing red blocks indicating sites of ghost activity.

When the player moves to a flashing block, the game shifts to an overhead street view and they must drive to the site, attempting to vacuum up stray ghosts if the vehicle is equipped to do so. Upon reaching the site, the player must maneuver two Ghostbusters to guide a Slimer ghost into position to be drawn into a trap. Successfully doing so awards money, but each failure causes the PK energy level to jump and incapacitates one of the player&#x27;s three team member characters.

The player must return to the Ghostbusters headquarters at intervals to empty the traps and/or revive any incapacitated team members. As the game progresses, the player must also keep free-roaming ghosts from reaching the temple of Zuul for as long as possible; each one that does so adds to the PK energy level. The ghosts occasionally merge to form the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, who will attempt to trample a city block. Stopping such an attack earns a bonus, but each failure to do so deducts money.

If the player has not earned more money than the total spent on equipment when the PK energy level reaches its maximum of 9999, the game ends immediately. Otherwise, the player must guide at least two Ghostbusters past Mr. Stay Puft in order to destroy the temple of Zuul. The game ends afterward, with the player earning a reward if successful.

The player is given an account number upon successfully completing the game. Entering this number at the initial screen allows the player to start a New Game Plus with the cash balance from the end of the previous game, enabling the purchase of more expensive equipment.

==Development==
Prior to &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, David Crane was one of the co-founders of Activision, and became a star at the company with games like &quot;Pitfall!&quot;. The film was still in production when game development began. Tom Lopez, the Vice President of Activision&#x27;s product development acquired the license for &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; to adapt into a game. Lopez went to the game design group saying the game would have to be made in six weeks, opposed to the normal nine months.

Crane had been building his own game titled &quot;Car Wars&quot; which already featured resource-allocation segments where players could buy different armaments&#x27; for their cars based on money the earned on levels. Columbia Pictures had no specific suggestion of what the game should be, but provided the film&#x27;s script and some story boards. Crane applied content from the film into the game, replacing guns, missiles and rocket launchers with more appropriate weapons that the Ghostbusters would use.

Unlike Crane&#x27;s earlier games which were predominantly developed by himself, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was made by a larger game design team, including game art made by Hilary Mills, sound effects and music by Russell Lieblich, and an intro sequence developed by Garry Kitchen, Dan Kitchen and Alex Demeo of Activision&#x27;s East coast division. Crane would later explain that his philosophy on creating a game on a licensed property was a game that would work within the theme of the license and to avoid making a game that borrows the look and feel of the original work, and thus applied this to turning &quot;Car Wars&quot; into &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.

The next weeks had the team working around the clock. Graphics in the game were developed by character artist Hillary Mills after Crane suggested he needed a variety of images, from animals, insects and treasures, and it took a long time to get ghosts that properly resembled ghosts on an 8-bit system. Midway through development, Crane felt it was important to add digitized speech to the game and decided to add quotes from the film together with a crowd chanting &quot;Ghostbusters!&quot; to capture the spirit of the film. Crane does not recall who did the digitized voice in the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; game, but had vague memories of walking down the hall from his office getting five or six people to all yell &quot;Ghostbusters!&quot; The music in the game was developed by Russell Lieblich, based on Ray Parker, Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme, and is accompanied by the lyrics to the song in the game. Crane passed the task of creating a bouncing ball sing-a-long to Garry Kitchen and his game designers, which was added to the game at the very last minute. Crane also wanted to have a different victory screen. Crane said &quot;I expected players to be disappointed with it. Sadly, to really beef that one sequence would have taken memory and artists time away from the main game.&quot; The game initially was going to have more elements such as when capturing ghosts, different enemies would show up with different solutions on how to deal with them. The game would also have had more accessories for the vehicle. 

Crane recalled that it would have been a better game with more development time, but also that it would then not have been such a financial success. Crane spent most of the time ensuring the game had a proper beginning, middle and end and, during final development, predominantly focused on fixing bugs. Crane said, as he does with all his games, he &quot;spent every hour that the schedule allowed tweaking the game, and it came out OK in the end. I could have done a lot more, but in the final analysis it seems to have been enough.&quot;

=== Ports ===
In 1985, the game was ported to various other systems with little input from Crane. He stated that &quot;By the time a game is being ported to other platforms, the designer of the original game has long since moved on to another original project. This is exactly what happened with &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;.&quot; In 1985, versions for the Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum, MSX, Atari 2600, and Atari 8-bit computers were released. In a retrospective overview of &quot;Edge&quot;, the publication stated that most ports had a &quot;patchy nature&quot;. Certain elements of the game are lost in later ports while others add elements. These include the Master System version which adds on-foot shooting gallery sequences and loses some animations, while the Nintendo Entertainment System version had a different ending and was described by &quot;Edge&quot; as having &quot;graphics so primitive it becomes hard to follow most of what&#x27;s going on.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Antic&quot; in May 1985 called &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; for Atari 8-bit fun to play, describing it as the first adaptation to capture the feel and theme of the movie on which it is based. &quot;Ahoy!&quot; stated that the Commodore 64 version &quot;incorporates a surprising number of elements&quot; from the film, with audio even better than the &quot;excellent visuals&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, &quot;Edge&quot; in 2007 called &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; &quot;dauntingly good&quot;, noting that despite the action sequences expected of a licensed title, the game was a &quot;polished, intelligently-paced strategic business simulation&quot;. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; discussed the original game stating that it remained &quot;an enjoyable (if aged) title to play.&quot; 

Reflecting on the game in 2006, Crane said &quot;The game was a good one, but not my best work ever.&quot; &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; actor Ernie Hudson said that his kids hated the Commodore 64 version of the game, believing that it &quot;sucked.&quot; The NES port and its gameplay were negatively received.

===Sales===
Mat Allen of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; described &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as a massive financial success on the Commodore 64. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; topped the monthly UK software sales charts for three months in early 1985, from January to March. Released before the film in the UK, it went on to be the UK&#x27;s fourth best-selling home video game of 1985.

In 1985, it and &quot;The Print Shop&quot; were reportedly the two most widely pirated Commodore 64 programs. In &quot;II Computing&quot;, Michael Ciraolo applied &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s charts and the market share of certain computers to compile the most Apple II games by October 1985. &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; placed at 8th. By late 1987, it was still Activision&#x27;s best-selling Commodore game.

The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of the game were included on the 1986 compilation &quot;They Sold a Million 3&quot;, along with &quot;Fighter Pilot&quot;, &quot;Rambo&quot; and &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot;. The game was also released on &quot;The Story So Far Volume IV&quot; in December 1989. It knocked &quot;Daley Thompson&#x27;s Decathlon&quot; from the top of the UK sales chart.

In 1988, Mastertronic re-released the Amstrad, Commodore, Spectrum and Atari computer versions of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; on their Ricochet label and it went on to become their most successful budget re-release, selling over 450,000 copies.

==Legacy==
Several film and television licensed games came out for the Commodore 64 following the release of &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;. A retrospective review noted releases like &quot;Street Hawk&quot;, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, &quot;Highlander&quot; and &quot;Miami Vice&quot; were described by &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; as &quot;cynical cash-ins&quot; having little to do with their respective shows. Crane commented on this stating there is usually no interest in licensing a film until the film itself would generate some actual excitement, and once the film releases, its excitement can only last so long and the all these tasks have to be fit into a compressed schedule, in which a game&#x27;s programming and design suffers.

<text>William Branwhite Clarke, FRS (2 June 179816 June 1878) was an English geologist and clergyman, active in Australia.

==Early life and England==
Clarke was born at East Bergholt, in Suffolk, the eldest child of William Clarke, schoolmaster, and his wife Sarah, &quot;née&quot; Branwhite. He was partly educated at his father&#x27;s house, under the Rev. R. G. S. Brown, B.D., and partly at Dedham Grammar School. In October 1817, he went to Cambridge and entered into residence at Jesus College. In 1819, he entered a poem for the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal; this was awarded to Macaulay, but Clarke&#x27;s poem &quot;Pompeii&quot;, published in the same year, was judged second. He took his BA degree in 1821, and obtained his MA degree in 1824. In 1821, he was appointed curate of Ramsholt in Suffolk, and he acted in his clerical capacity in other places until 1839. He was also master of the Free School of East Bergholt for about 18 months in 1830–1. Having become interested in geology through the teachings of Adam Sedgwick, he used his opportunities and gathered many interesting facts on the geology of East Anglia which were embodied in a paper &quot;On the Geological Structure and Phenomena of Suffolk&quot; (Trans. Geol. Soc. 1837). He also communicated a series of papers on the geology of S.E. to the Magazine of Nat. Hist. (1837–1838).

==Career in Australia==
In 1839, after a severe illness, Clarke left England for New South Wales, mainly with the object of benefiting by the sea voyage. He had been commissioned by some of his English colleagues to ascertain the extent and character of the carboniferous formation in New South Wales (Clarke&#x27;s letter to Sydney Morning Herald, 18 February 1852). He remained, however, in that country, and came to be regarded as the Father of Australian Geology.

Clarke was headmaster of The King&#x27;s School, Parramatta, in May 1839 until the end of 1840. Until 1870 he ministered to parishes from Parramatta to the Hawkesbury River, then of Campbelltown, and finally of Willoughby. He zealously devoted attention to the geology of the country, with results that have been of paramount importance. In 1841 he found specimens of gold, but he was not the first European who had obtained it in situ in the country. (This honour goes correctly to Government Surveyor James McBrien who found flakes at Locksley NSW in February 1823). Clarke described finding it both in the detrital deposits and in the quartz reefs west of the Blue Mountains, the same area where McBrien had found it, and he declared his belief in its abundance. Mr R Lowe, Lieutenant William Lawson, an unnamed convict (who was flogged for the discovery), Dr Johann Lhotsky, and &quot;Count&quot; Paul Strzelecki had also found gold in Australia before Clarke. It appears they mostly had found alluvial flakes, whereas Clarke had found it embedded in quartz rocks. Early in 1844 he showed the governor of New South Wales, Sir George Gipps, some specimens of gold he had found. Sir George asked him where he had got it, and when Clarke told him said &quot;Put it away or we shall have our throats cut&quot;. Clarke, in his evidence before the select committee on his claims, which sat in 1861, stated that he knew of the existence of the gold in 1841. Clarke, however, agreed with Gipps that it may not be wise to announce the presence of gold in the colony. Clarke continued his clerical duties, but was occasionally lent to the government to carry out geological investigations. In 1849 he made the first discovery of tin in Australia and in 1859 he made known the occurrence of diamonds. He discovered secondary (Cretaceous) fossils in Queensland in 1860, he was also the first to indicate the presence of Silurian rocks, and to determine the age of the coal-bearing rocks in New South Wales. In 1869 he announced the discovery of remains of &quot;Dinornis&quot; in Queensland. He finished the preparation of the fourth edition of his &quot;Remarks on the Sedimentary Formations of New South Wales&quot; on his eightieth birthday, and died a fortnight later on 16 June 1878. He was buried in the St Thomas cemetery, the graveyard of the North Shore church he was rector of for many years; and his widow and some descendants and relatives are close by.
==Legacy==

Clarke was a trustee of the Australian Museum at Sydney, and an active member of the Royal Society of New South Wales of which he was vice-president 1866–1878; the Clarke Medal awarded by the Society is named in his honour. In 1860 he published &quot;Researches in the Southern Gold Fields of New South Wales&quot;. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1876, and in the following year was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London. His contributions to Australian scientific journals were numerous. He died near Sydney. His name is commemorated in the William Clarke College school at Kellyville, NSW and the WB Clarke Geoscience Centre at Londonderry, NSW operated by the Geological Survey of New South Wales.

His works in geology included the field of palaeontology and his collections and receipt of fossil material formed the foundation of research on Australia&#x27;s extinct flora and fauna. Clarke did not describe the specimens he avidly collected throughout his life, these were instead forwarded to societies in England for their scientific examination. The results of his contemporaries studies and descriptions of Australian palaeontology and geology were incorporated into his own publications, and he remained current with advances in these fields despite his remote location.

<text>Clearcutting, clearfelling or clearcut logging is a forestry/logging practice in which most or all trees in an area are uniformly cut down. Along with shelterwood and seed tree harvests, it is used by foresters to create certain types of forest ecosystems and to promote select species that require an abundance of sunlight or grow in large, even-age stands. Clearcutting is a forestry practice that mimics the stand initiation stage of forest succession after a natural disturbance such as stand replacing fire or wind-throw, and is successful for regeneration of fast growing, sun tolerant tree species and wildlife species that readily regenerate in post-stand replacing sites. Logging companies and forest-worker unions in some countries support the practice for scientific, safety and economic reasons, while detractors consider it a form of deforestation that destroys natural habitats and contributes to climate change. Environmentalists, traditional owners, local residents and others have regularly campaigned against clearcutting, including through the use of blockades and nonviolent direct action.

Clearcutting is the most economically efficient method of logging. It also may create detrimental side effects, such as the loss of topsoil, the costs of which are intensely debated by economic, environmental and other interests. In addition to the purpose of harvesting wood, clearcutting is used to create land for farming. Ultimately, the effects of clearcutting on the land will depend on how well or poorly the forest is managed, and whether it is converted to non-forest land uses after clearcuts.

While deforestation of both temperate and tropical forests through clearcutting has received considerable media attention in recent years, the other large forests of the world, such as the taiga, also known as boreal forests, are also under threat of rapid development. In Russia, North America and Scandinavia, creating protected areas and granting long-term leases to tend and regenerate trees—thus maximizing future harvests—are among the means used to limit the harmful effects of clearcutting. Long-term studies of clearcut forests, such as studies of the Pasoh Rainforest in Malaysia, are also important in providing insights into the conservation of forest resources worldwide.

==Types==
Many variations of clearcutting exist; the most common professional practices are:
* &quot;Standard (uniform) clearcut&quot; – removal of every stem (whether commercially viable or not), so no canopy remains.
* &quot;Patch clearcut&quot; – removal of all the stems in a limited, predetermined area (patch).
* &quot;Strip clearcut&quot; – removal of all the stems in a row (strip), usually placed perpendicular to the prevailing winds in order to minimize the possibility of windthrow.
* &quot;Clearcutting-with-reserves&quot; – removal of the majority of standing stems, leaving a few reserved for other purposes (for example as snags for wildlife habitat), (often confused with the seed tree method).
* &quot;Slash-and-burn&quot; – the permanent conversion of tropical and subtropicals forests for agricultural purposes. This is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical forests where population growth creates land needs from smallholders in developing and least developed countries. Slash-and-burn entails the removal of all stems in a particular area. This can be a form of deforestation, when the land is converted to other uses. However, some indigenous forest peoples, for example the 19th century Forest Finns rotate over the land and it does return to forest and this would be sustainable. Slash and burn techniques are typically used by civilians in search of land for living and agricultural purposes. The forest is first clear cut, and the remaining material is burned. One of the driving forces behind this process is a result of overpopulation and subsequent sprawl. These methods also occur as a result of commercial farming. The lumber is sold for profit, and the land, cleared of all remaining brush and suitable for agricultural development, is sold to farmers.

Clearcutting contrasts with selective cutting, such as high grading, in which only commercially valuable trees are harvested, leaving all others. This practice can reduce the genetic viability of the forest over time, resulting in poorer or less vigorous offspring in the stand. Clearcutting also differs from a coppicing system, by allowing revegetation by seedlings. Additionally, destructive forms of forest management are commonly referred to as &#x27;clearcutting&#x27;.

==Clearcutting regeneration, harvesting or system==


Clearcutting can be differentiated into
* &quot;Clearcutting&quot; – clean felling by complete exploitation and removal of all the trees in one operation ... a harvesting method
* &quot;Clearcutting method&quot; – a method for regenerating an even-aged community by removing all the mature trees
* &quot;Clearcutting system&quot; – a silvicultural system incorporating the clearcutting method to remove (clear) the mature community over a considerable area at one time

Confusion between these different uses of the term is common. Furthermore, as indicated above many variations mean technically correct usage may not be descriptive enough to know what is meant on that particular occasion.

A clearcut is distinguished from selective logging where typically only a few trees per hectare are harvested in proportions dictated by management objectives. Clearcut logging is also distinct from wildland fire use, and from forest thinning. In these latter two it is common practice to leave trees that are considered undesirable, such as those that are too diseased, stunted or small to be marketable. Selective logging is usually practiced in areas with access to infrastructure.

==Effects on the environment==
Environmental groups criticize clear-cutting as destructive to water, soil, wildlife, and atmosphere, and recommend the use of sustainable alternatives. Clear-cutting impacts the water cycle, as trees hold water and topsoil. Clear-cutting in forests removes the trees which would otherwise have been transpiring large volumes of water and also physically damages the grasses, mosses, lichens, and ferns populating the understory. Removal or damage of the biota reduces the local capacity to retain water, which can exacerbate flooding and lead to increased leaching of nutrients from the soil. The maximum nutrient loss occurs around year two and returns to pre-clearcutting levels by year four after the cut.

Removing trees surrounding stream banks prevents shading of the water body, which raises the temperature of riverbanks and rivers. Because the trees no longer hold down the soil, riverbanks increasingly erode as sediment into the water, creating excess nutrients which exacerbate the changes in the river and create problems miles away, in the sea. Clear cutting on a large scale in a watershed can cause sediment and nutrients that leach into the streams cause the acidity of the stream to increase. The nutrient content of the soil was found to return to five percent of pre-clearcutting levels after 64 years.

===Negative impacts===
Clearcutting can have negative impacts, both for humans and local flora and fauna. A study from the University of Oregon found that in certain zones, areas that were clear cut had nearly three times the amount of erosion due to slides. When the roads required by the clearcutting were factored in, the increase in slide activity appeared to be about 5 times greater compared to nearby forested areas. The roads built for clearcutting interrupt normal surface drainage because the roads are not as permeable as the normal ground cover. The roads also change subsurface water movement due to the redistribution of soil and rock. Clearcutting may lead to increased stream flow during storms, loss of habitat and species diversity, opportunities for invasive and weedy species, and negative impacts on scenery, specifically, a growth of contempt by those familiar with the area for the wooded, planet aftermaths, as well as a decrease in property values; diminished recreation, hunting, and fishing opportunities. Clearcutting decreases the occurrence of natural disturbances like forest fires and natural uprooting. Over time, this can deplete the local seed bank.

In temperate and boreal climates, clearcutting can have an effect on the depth of snow, which is usually greater in a clearcut area than in the forest, due to a lack of interception and evapotranspiration. This results in less soil frost, which in combination with higher levels of direct sunlight results in snowmelt occurring earlier in the spring and earlier peak runoff.

The world&#x27;s rain forests could completely vanish in a hundred years at the current rate of deforestation. Between June 2000 and June 2008, more than of rainforest were cleared in the Brazilian Amazon. Huge areas of forest have already been lost. For example, only eight to fourteen percent of the Atlantic Forest in South America now remains. While deforestation rates have slowed since 2004, forest loss is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Farmers slash and burn large parcels of forest every year to create grazing and croplands, but the forest&#x27;s nutrient-poor soil often renders the land ill-suited for agriculture, and within a year or two, the farmers move on.

===Positive perspectives===
Clearcutting can be practiced to encourage the growth and proliferation of tree species that require high light intensity. Generally, a harvest area wider than double the height of the adjacent trees will no longer be subject to the moderating influence of the woodland on the microclimate. The width of the harvest area can thus determine which species will come to dominate. Those with high tolerance to extremes in temperature, soil moisture, and resistance to browsing may be established, in particular secondary successional pioneer species.

Clearcutting can be used by foresters as a method of mimicking a natural disturbance and increasing primary successional species, such as poplar (aspen), willow and black cherry in North America. Clearcutting has also proved to be effective in creating animal habitat and browsing areas, which otherwise would not exist without natural stand-replacing disturbances such as wildfires, large scale windthrow, or avalanches.

Clearcuts are used to help regenerate species that cannot compete in mature forests. A number of them are aspen, jack pine, and, in areas with poor soils, oaks—are important species for both game and nongame wildlife species. Clearcutting can also lead to increased vascular-plant diversity in the area. This is most pronounced after a couple years of clearcutting and in herb-rich forests where scarification took place.

No significant changes in water temperature were observed when patch clearcutting was done away from a river. This suggests that patch clearcutting is a possible solution to concerns about changes in water temperature due to clearcutting. The effects of clearcutting on soil nutrient content were not examined in this study.

More recently, forest managers have found that clearcutting oak stands helps regenerate oak forests in areas of poor soil. The tree canopies in oak forests often shade out the ground, making it impossible for newly sprouted oaks to grow. When the mature trees are removed, the saplings stand a chance of recruiting into the forest.

===Effects on wildlife===
Clearcutting&#x27;s main destruction is towards habitats, where it makes the habitats more vulnerable in the future to damage by insects, diseases, acid rain, and wind. Removal of all trees from an area destroys the physical habitats of many species in wildlife. Also, clearcutting can contribute to problems for ecosystems that depend on forests, like the streams and rivers that run through them.

In Canada, the black-tailed deer population is at further risk after clearcutting. The deer are a food source for wolves and cougars, as well as First Nations and other hunters. While deer may not be at risk in cities and rural countryside, where they can be seen running through neighbourhoods and feeding on farms, in higher altitude areas they require forest shelter.

===In Maine===
In Maine, a form of land management known as Outcome Based Forestry (OBF) allows for a wide range of harvesting as long as the removed trees do not exceed the amount of tree growth. Since implemented, this program has led to large-scale clearcutting and monoculture tree planting, and research by the University of Maine&#x27;s Sustainability Solutions Initiative has found that of certified forest land in (primarily northern) Maine is being overharvested, leading to reduced long-term stability of timber harvests and increased erosion and pollution in the watershed. These practices have sparked environmental justice concerns regarding the health and well-being of foresters and locals.

<text>Forschungszentrum Jülich (FZJ; “Jülich Research Centre”) is a German national research institution that pursues interdisciplinary research in the fields of energy, information, and bioeconomy. It operates a broad range of research infrastructures like supercomputers, an atmospheric simulation chamber, electron microscopes, a particle accelerator, cleanrooms for nanotechnology, among other things. Current research priorities include the structural change in the Rhineland lignite-mining region, hydrogen, and quantum technologies. As a member of the Helmholtz Association with roughly 6,800 employees in ten institutes and 80 subinstitutes, Jülich is one of the largest research institutions in Europe. 

Forschungszentrum Jülich&#x27;s headquarters are located between the cities of Aachen, Cologne, and Düsseldorf on the outskirts of the North Rhine-Westphalian town of Jülich. FZJ has 15 branch offices in Germany and abroad, including eight sites at European and international neutron and synchrotron radiation sources, two joint institutes with the University of Münster, Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), and Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), and three offices of Project Management Jülich (PtJ) in the cities of Bonn, Rostock, and Berlin. Jülich cooperates closely with RWTH Aachen University within the Jülich Aachen Research Alliance (JARA).

The institution was established on 11 December 1956 by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia as a registered association before it was renamed Nuclear Research Centre Jülich in 1967. In 1990, its name was changed to &quot;Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH&quot;.
== History ==
On 11 December 1956, the State Parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia decided to establish an &quot;atomic research centre&quot;. The Society for the Promotion of Nuclear Physics Research (GFKF) was thus established as a registered association (e. V.). Its founder is considered to be State Secretary Leo Brandt (Ministry of Economic Affairs and Transport of the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia). Several locations were considered but the decision was made in favour of the Stetternich forest in what was then the district of Jülich. The Society for the Promotion of Nuclear Physics Research (GFKF) was renamed Nuclear Research Centre Jülich (or KFA for short, which was taken from the German). Seven years later, it was converted into a limited liability company (GmbH), and in 1990, it was named Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH. The partners of Forschungszentrum Jülich are the Federal Republic of Germany (90%) and the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (10%).

=== MERLIN and DIDO ===
In 1958, the foundation stone was laid for the research reactors MERLIN (FRJ-1) and DIDO (FRJ-2), and they went into operation in 1962. The FRJ-1 research reactor was decommissioned in 1985 and completely dismantled between 2000 and 2008. The FRJ-2 research reactor was a DIDO-class reactor and it was used for neutron scattering experiments. It was operated by the Central Research Reactors Division (ZFR). FRJ-2 was the strongest neutron source in Germany until the research neutron source Heinz Maier-Leibnitz in Garching (FRM II) was put in operation. FRJ-2 was primarily used to conduct scattering and spectroscopic experiments on condensed matter. It was in operation from 14 November 1962 until 2 May 2006. In 2006, the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS) was founded, reflecting Forschungszentrum Jülich&#x27;s role as a national competence centre for neutron scattering. Six of the most important instruments were moved from FRJ-2 to FRM II; new instruments were also assembled there.

=== AVR ===

In 1956, an interest group was formed to prepare the construction of the AVR reactor. In 1959, it became the &quot;Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor GmbH&quot; (AVR GmbH) – a consortium of 15 local electricity suppliers headed by the Düsseldorf municipal utilities (Stadtwerke Düsseldorf) as the owner and operator (other partners included the municipal utilities in Aachen, Bonn, Bremen, Hagen, Hanover, Munich, and Wuppertal). The aim was to demonstrate the feasibility and operability of a graphite-moderated, gas-cooled high-temperature reactor to produce electricity. BBC and Krupp were responsible for construction of the AVR reactor, which began in August 1961 and was completed in 1966, after the consortium had received the design contract in April 1957 and the construction contract in February 1959. The cost of construction was in the region of DM 100 million.

In 1967, the AVR reactor was put into operation and began feeding electricity into the national power grid. On 31 December 1988, the AVR reactor was shut down; during its operation, it had proven the feasibility of the pebble bed reactor. Karl Strauss said in 2016 that &quot;the facility had generally been operated without any problems&quot;. The mean availability was 60.4%. AVR received scientific support and operating subsidies from the Nuclear Research Centre Jülich (KFA) but was formally independent. From the mid-1980s, the then KFA reduced its commitment to the further development of the gas-cooled high-temperature reactor.

The AVR pebble bed reactor is still being dismantled today (see its dismantling and disposal). The severe contamination of the reactor core with radioactive graphite dust particles proved particularly difficult. This contamination was caused by the coating of the fuel pellets made of silicon carbide and porous carbon, which leaked under the high temperatures in the reactor core and released radioactive fission products. The BBC and Krupp construction consortium had miscalculated the temperatures in the reactor core as 300 K lower. FZJ solved the problem by filling the reactor core with foamed lightweight concrete, which binds the dust particles and stabilizes the reactor core. Safety researcher Rainer Moormann, who raised public attention to the graphite dust contamination, was awarded the Whistleblower Prize in 2011. Immediately after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, FZJ and AVR GmbH established an independent expert group to investigate the history of the AVR reactor, and in particular, to issue an official statement on Moormann&#x27;s public disclosures.

=== Fields of research since the 1960s ===

Source:

In addition to research on nuclear physics and nuclear energy, work began soon after FZJ&#x27;s foundation on new, non-nuclear topics and projects, such as environmental research and soil research for agriculture. One of the first institutes to be founded was the Institute of Biology (Botany department) on 1 May 1961. In autumn 1961, the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics (ZAM) was established, combining a mathematical institute with a computer centre, which was unusual at that time. Research into what is now known as neuroscience began in 1964 when the Institute of Nuclear Medicine was founded and radiotracers were developed and used in imaging techniques. Another research priority was understanding solid states as a basis for the investigation and modification of material properties, for example for new materials in energy research. In 1970, the Institute of Solid State Research was established.

In the decades that followed, Jülich expanded its range of research fields to include life sciences, energy and environmental research, materials science, and information technologies. The Institute of Biotechnology was founded in 1977. In 1981, the large-scale facility TEXTOR was put into operation. It was Jülich&#x27;s fusion experiment for exploring nuclear fusion reactor technology in the field of plasma-wall interaction. The facility was decommissioned at the end of 2013. In 1993, the COSY particle accelerator went into operation. In 1984, the CRAY X-MP supercomputer, one of the fastest computers in the world, was inaugurated at ZAM. ZAM played a pivotal role in founding the first national supercomputing centre (HLRZ) in 1987. In 2007, ZAM became the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC), which today operates the powerful supercomputer JUWELS and makes it available to European researchers.

The new scientific orientation led to a name change and &quot;Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH&quot; (FZJ) came into being in 1990. Forschungszentrum Jülich is a founding member of the then Association of National Research Centres (AGF, 1970), which became the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres in 1995. In 2004, the Ernst Ruska-Centre for Electron Microscopy was founded. It is equipped with transmission electron microscopes. Soil and environmental research were interlinked with climate research. In 2001, the SAPHIR atmospheric simulation chamber was inaugurated, followed by the PhyTec experimental facility for plants in 2014. Collaboration with RWTH Aachen University was consolidated in 2007 by establishing the Jülich Aachen Research Alliance (JARA). In 2011, Forschungszentrum Jülich, in partnership with the universities in Aachen, Bonn, Cologne, and Düsseldorf, founded the Bioeconomy Science Center (BioSc) as a scientific centre of excellence for sustainable bioeconomy. FZJ also works closely with the universities in Bonn, Cologne, and Aachen within the Geoverbund ABC/J. In 2011, the ESS Competence Centre was established at Forschungszentrum Jülich. It coordinates the German contributions to the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Lund, Sweden.

== Corporate structure ==
Forschungszentrum Jülich is a limited liability company (GmbH) with the following company bodies: Partners&#x27; Meeting, Supervisory Board, and Board of Directors. The Partners&#x27; Meeting comprises representatives of the German federal government and state government of North Rhine-Westphalia. The chair of the board of directors is Wolfgang Marquardt, who has been in office since 1 July 2014. The other members of the Board of Directors are – as of October 2021 – Karsten Beneke (vice-chair since 2011), Astrid Lambrecht (since 2021), and Frauke Melchior (since 2021). FZJ&#x27;s committees are the Scientific Advisory Council and the Scientific and Technical Council (WTR).

===Finances===

The annual budget of Forschungszentrum Jülich was approximately €948 million in 2022. Of this, 48% was institutional funding from the German federal government and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 52% was external funding. External funding comprises international (EU) and national (federal and state government, DFG, and other) project funding, R&amp;D and infrastructure services (contracts), as well as project management on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany and the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

===Employees===

Forschungszentrum Jülich has 6,796 employees (as of Dec. 2020). Almost 2,700 of these employees are scientists, and of these scientists 850 are doctoral researchers. The scientists work in the natural, life, and engineering sciences in the fields of information, energy, and bioeconomy. Around 867 people work in the administration and service areas; 1,380 individuals work for Project Management Jülich; and 500 employees are classed as technical employees. FZJ also has more than 300 vocational trainees and students on placement in 23 different professions. In 2020, 672 visiting scientists from 62 countries were conducting research at Jülich.

===Prizes and awards for Jülich employees===

On 10 December 2007, Peter Grünberg from Forschungszentrum Jülich was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Albert Fert from Paris-Sud University in France. The two scientists were honoured for the discovery of giant magnetoresistance, which they had made independently of each other. This was the first Nobel Prize for an employee of Forschungszentrum Jülich or the Helmholtz Association. In 1998, Peter Grünberg had been awarded the German Future Prize, and in 2007, he and Albert Fert were joint recipients of the Japan Prize as well as the Israeli Wolf Prize in Physics. The Wolf Prize in Physics was also jointly awarded in 2011 to Knut Urban from Forschungszentrum Jülich, Maximilian Haider from CEOS GmbH, Heidelberg, and Harald Rose from the Technical University of Darmstadt for their breakthrough in electron microscopy. They also received the Japanese Honda Prize in 2008 for the same discovery. In 2002, Maria-Regina Kula und Martina Pohl won the German Future Prize for the development of biological catalysts.

===Training and teaching at Forschungszentrum Jülich===

In 2020, more than 300 people trained in 23 different professions at Forschungszentrum Jülich. In cooperation with RWTH Aachen University and Aachen University of Applied Sciences, FZJ also offers dual vocational and academic courses. After successful completion of their final exams, trainees are offered a six-month employment contract in their chosen profession. Since Forschungszentrum Jülich was founded, more than 5,000 trainees have completed their training in more than 25 different professions.

In a joint procedure with the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the institute directors at Forschungszentrum Jülich are appointed professors at one of the neighbouring universities (e.g. in Aachen, Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf, Bochum, Duisburg-Essen, Münster) in line with the &quot;Jülich model&quot;. In cooperation with the universities, graduate and research schools are established (e.g. International Helmholtz Research School of Biophysics and Soft Matter with the universities in Cologne Düsseldorf). The idea behind this is to support and encourage the interdisciplinary scientific education of doctoral students.

== Research fields and activities ==

=== Research areas ===
Forschungszentrum Jülich groups its research activities into three interdisciplinary strategic research areas: energy, information, and bioeconomy.

==== Information ====
Scientists in the research area of information investigate how information is processed in biological and technical systems. They are working on simulation and data sciences within high-performance computing (HPC) or supercomputing, brain research, and research into bioelectronics- and nanoelectronics-based information technologies with the aim of transferring findings on biological information processing to technical systems. In the field of supercomputing, Jülich develops and operates its own supercomputers (see section on research infrastructures), which can be used for simulation calculations. Brain research also draws on these facilities. Brain research at Jülich aims to shed light on the molecular and structural organization of the brain to better understand illnesses such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Research is conducted in cooperation with the neighbouring university hospitals in Bonn, Cologne, Aachen, and Düsseldorf.

Research into quantum technologies is associated with the research field of information. This includes work on quantum computers, with components, concepts, and prototypes being developed at Jülich. Forschungszentrum Jülich cooperated with Google in developing the Sycamore quantum computer, and it will be home to the first universal quantum computer developed in Europe as part of the OpenSuperQ project.

===Energy===

Jülich research is aimed towards an energy system based on renewable energy sources. This research field is primarily covered by the Institute of Energy and Climate Research (IEK). IEK has 14 subinstitutes that focus on various tasks in collaboration with other institutes. Its research priorities include photovoltaics, fuel cells, and hydrogen as an energy carrier, research into batteries and new methods of energy storage, as well as processes for increasing the efficiency of fossil energy. In the context of the feasibility of the energy transition, Forschungszentrum Jülich explores and models energy systems. With its materials research, the institute is also involved in developing nuclear fusion reactors (such as ITER and Wendelstein 7-X). In the field of producing energy through nuclear fission (atomic energy), FZJ now only conducts research into the disposal of nuclear waste. Two subinstitutes of IEK are involved in atmospheric and climate research, focusing on the interactions between human activities, air quality, and climate, as well as on improving climate and atmospheric models in cooperation with the Jülich Supercomputing Centre.

FZJ, with 265 full-time positions (as of 2019), boasts the largest site for investigating hydrogen technologies within the Helmholtz Association. Research is conducted into the production, conversion, and storage (e.g. in liquid media, liquid organic hydrogen carriers) of hydrogen, as well as into the infrastructure of a hydrogen economy.

===Sustainable bioeconomy===

The bioeconomy is an economic system based on the sustainable use of biological resources including plants, animals, and microorganisms. It is argued that a bioeconomy will become necessary due to the finite nature of oil reserves, on which many industrial and everyday products are based, anthropogenic climate change, and the continued growth of the world population. In the area of sustainable bioeconomy, FZJ concentrates on the transition from an oil-based economy to a bioeconomy. This research is conducted in the field of biotechnology in an effort to use renewable raw materials to biotechnologically produce industrially or pharmaceutically relevant base materials. Plant research focuses on optimizing crop yield and the usability of plants as fuels. The third research area at FZJ focuses on chemical and physical processes in soil.

===Structural change in the Rhineland lignite-mining region===

The Rhineland lignite-mining region, where FZJ is located, is undergoing an important structural change due to the coal phase-out. The state government of North Rhine-Westphalia aims to transform the region into a European model region for energy supply and resource security. Through its research projects, FZJ will support the successful transformation of the Rhineland region. These projects include the cultivation of novel plants, sustainable agriculture, and the hydrogen economy, as well as collaborations between the field of information and industry, for example in the area of artificial intelligence or data analysis. The aim is to create a locational advantage for innovative enterprises.

== Research infrastructures ==
Forschungszentrum Jülich operates numerous research infrastructures, which are available to internal and external users. FZJ coordinates and is involved in several research infrastructures in the ESFRI Roadmap, which identifies strategically important facilities and platforms in the EU. Examples include the neuroscientific digital platform EBRAINS, the EMPHASIS project for plant phenotyping, the coordination of the European supercomputer network PRACE, and the IAGOS cooperation for research into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere using instruments on commercial aircraft. The Ernst Ruska-Centre 2.0 for ultrahigh-resolution electron microscopy and the German contribution to the European Aerosols, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS-D) have been part of Germany&#x27;s National Roadmap since 2019. In this Roadmap, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) prioritizes infrastructure projects that are important in terms of strategy and research policy.

=== Helmholtz Nano Facility ===
The Helmholtz Nano Facility (HNF) is a facility with a large (1,100 m2) ISO 1–3 classified clean room. The HNF is a central technology platform for the production of nanostructures and circuits within the Helmholtz Association. Work at the HNF focuses on green microchips/computing, quantum computing, neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and microfluidics.

=== Ernst Ruska-Centre ===
The Ernst Ruska-Centre for Microscopy and Spectroscopy with Electrons (ER-C) was selected by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as a national research infrastructure for ultrahigh-resolution electron microscopy. The electron-optical instruments at ER-C can also be used by external scientists and enterprises. They make it possible to investigate structures at the atomic and molecular level. The PICO electron microscope can be used for this work as it is can correct the lens errors of spherical and chromatic aberration.

=== SAPHIR atmospheric simulation chamber ===

In the 20-metre-long SAPHIR chamber (Simulation of Atmospheric PHotochemistry In a large Reaction Chamber), the Institute of Energy and Climate Research – Troposphere (IEK-8) explores photochemical reactions in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

=== Jülich Plant Phenotyping Centre ===
The Jülich Plant Phenotyping Center (JPPC) is a leading international institution for the development and application of non-invasive techniques for quantifying the structure and function of plants. At JPPC, technology is developed and plant traits are analysed on a mechanistic level under high-throughput and field conditions.

=== Supercomputers ===
The Jülich Supercomputing Centre at Forschungszentrum Jülich operates supercomputers of the highest performance class and emerged from the first German high-performance computing centre (HLRZ), which was founded at Jülich in 1987. In 2003, a 1,000 m2 machine hall was built for the supercomputers next to the Jülich Supercomputing Centre. JSC joined forces with the High Performance Computing Centre Stuttgart (HLRS) and the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) in Garching near Munich to form the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing (GCS), which unites the three most powerful computing centres under one roof. In addition, JSC coordinates the development of the European supercomputer network PRACE. JSC is headed by physicist and computer scientist Thomas Lippert.

==== JURECA (2015) ====
The JURECA supercomputer replaced JUROPA in 2015 and was expanded to include a GPU-based booster module in 2017. This made JURECA the world&#x27;s first supercomputer with a modular architecture to be put into productive operation. With a computer performance of 3.78 petaflop/s, the system ranked 29th in the TOP500 list of November 2017. Between autumn 2020 and the beginning of 2021, the JURECA cluster module was replaced by the JURECA-DC module, which is designed to process large volumes of data and increased the system&#x27;s peak performance to 23.5 petaflop/s.
==== JUWELS (2018) ====
The JUWELS supercomputer (Jülich Wizard for European Leadership Science) was put into operation in 2018 and was expanded in 2020 to include a GPU-based booster module. The combined cluster and booster modules have a theoretical peak performance of 85 quadrillion floating point operations per second (85 petaflop/s), which made JUWELS the most powerful supercomputer in Europe and the 7th most powerful in the world when the booster debuted on the November 2020 TOP500 list. Furthermore, the JUWELS booster module was the most energy-efficient system of the ten most powerful computers in the world when it was introduced.

==== JUPITER (2024) ====
As part of the EuroHPC JU the Jülich Supercomputing Centre will host the JUPITER supercomputer (Joint Undertaking Pioneer for Innovative and Transformative Exascale Research), which is to be the first exascale supercomputer in Europe. The machine is being installed in 2024 and should eclipse the threshold of one quintillion (&quot;1&quot; followed by 18 zeros) calculations per second.

=== Medical imaging ===
The Institute of Neurosciences and Medicine (INM) develops and applies medical imaging techniques using MRI and PET for clinical applications and to investigate neurological, neuropsychological, and psychological issues. Equipment at INM includes a combined 3 tesla and 9.4 Tesla MRI PET tomograph as well as a 7 Tesla, 4 Tesla, and 3 Tesla MRI system.

=== Research with neutrons ===
Forschungszentrum Jülich is a national competence centre for neutron scattering. The Jülich Centre for Neutron Science (JCNS), which operates instruments at various neutron sources all over the world, was established in 2006 – a few months before the original neutron source (the Jülich research reactor FRJ-2) was decommissioned. Six of the most important instruments were moved from FRJ-2 to FRM II; new instruments were also assembled there. In addition, JCNS has branch offices at the Institut Laue-Langevin (ILL) in Grenoble and at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) in Oak Ridge. JCNS also plans to operate instruments at the European Spallation Source (ESS), which is currently being constructed in Lund, Sweden, as well as at future high-brilliance accelerator-driven neutron sources. The instruments will be made available to a wide range of users, for example to conduct research into energy materials and active ingredients for medications or to analyse protein structures and magnetic materials.

=== Cooler synchrotron (COSY) ===
The COSY cooler synchrotron is a particle accelerator (synchrotron) and storage ring (circumference: 184 m) for accelerating protons and deuterons operated by the Nuclear Physics Institute (IKP) at FZJ.

COSY is characterized by beam cooling, which reduces the deviation of particles from their predetermined path (can also be understood as the thermal motion of particles) using electron or stochastic cooling. At COSY, there are a number of experimental facilities for studies in the field of hadron physics. Research currently focuses on investigating the electric dipole moment of protons, testing components and methods for the planned Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research, and on preparatory experiments constructing an accelerator-based neutron source. Previous core experiments such as the ANKE magnetic spectrometer, the TOF time-of-flight mass spectrometer, and the WASA universal detector, which was moved to COSY from the CELSIUS storage ring of The Svedberg Labors (TSL) in Uppsala, have been decommissioned and mostly dismantled. The synchrotron is used by scientists from German and international research institutions at internal and external target stations. It is one of the research facilities used for collaborative research funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.

=== EBRAINS ===
EBRAINS is a digital, European research infrastructure that was created as part of the EU-funded Human Brain Project (HBP). Forschungszentrum Jülich supports the infrastructure by providing computing capacities for simulations and big data analyses. The aim is to further brain research and to apply scientific findings in this field to innovations inspired by the brain in computing, medicine, and industry.

=== EMPHASIS ===
The European Infrastructure for Multi-Scale Plant Phenomics and Simulation for Food Security in a Changing Climate (EMPHASIS) is a pan-European, distributed infrastructure for plant phenotyping. The aim of this EU platform, which is coordinated by Forschungszentrum Jülich, is to analyse and quantify the external characteristics of plants (the &quot;phenotype&quot;) such as the root architecture or the number of leaves. EMPHASIS integrates information systems with data acquisition using mathematical models and helps scientists to analyse plants for a sustainable European agriculture in different environments with the aim of enabling more efficient plant production in a changing climate. The EU has provided €4 million in funding for the creation of the platform.

=== Biomolecular NMR Centre ===

The Biomolecular NMR Centre is a cooperation between the Institute of Biological Information Processing – Structural Biochemistry at Forschungszentrum Jülich and the Institute of Physical Biology at HHU Düsseldorf. It operates various high-field NMR spectrometers for liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy for research into biologically and medically relevant proteins in order to determine, for example, the three-dimensional structure with a high resolution. This technology is also used to investigate the structural basis for affinities and specificities of these macromolecules in protein-ligand interactions.

The Biomolecular NMR Centre has one 900 MHz NMR spectrometer for liquid-state NMR spectroscopy, one 800 MHz NMR spectrometer for liquid- and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, a 700 MHz device for liquid-state NMR, two 600 MHz devices for liquid-state NMR, and another 600 MHz NMR spectrometer for solid-state NMR spectroscopy. A novel 600 MHz DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR device was installed in 2014.

=== Membrane Centre ===
The Membrane Centre at Forschungszentrum Jülich (approx. 1550 m2) provides a research infrastructure for the development of membrane systems, covering the entire spectrum of services from the production of the materials needed and the characterization using analytical instruments right up to the testing of modules and components. A priority is the development of novel membrane systems for energy technology in order to separate greenhouse gases from exhaust gases and to provide a basis for novel fuel cells and solid-state batteries.

== Other research projects ==
Forschungszentrum Jülich has a lattice steel mast (124 metres high) for meteorological measurements. It is equipped with platforms at 10 m, 20 m, 30 m, 50 m, 80 m, 100 m, and 120 m, on which measuring instruments are positioned. The measuring mast was erected in 1963/4 and is a triangular steel framework construction.

== Former research activities ==

=== Early supercomputers ===

==== IBM p690 cluster &quot;Jump&quot; (2004) ====
The massively parallel supercomputer IBM p690 cluster Jump was put into operation at the beginning of 2004. With 1,312 Power4+ 2C 1.7 GHz processors (41 nodes, each with 32 processors) and an internal memory of 5 terabytes (128 gigabytes per node), the computer had a maximum performance of 5.6 teraflop/s. It was ranked 30th in the list of the world&#x27;s most powerful computers at the time of its inauguration. The nodes were connected to each other by a high performance switch (HPS). Through a globally parallel data system, applications had access to more than 60 terabytes of storage space and an integrated tape drive with a capacity of one petabyte. The IBM p690 cluster Jump was run on the operating system AIX 5.1. In 2008, the system was temporarily replaced by IBM Power6 p6 575 until JuRoPA began operating.

==== Jülich BlueGene/L supercomputer (JUBL, 2006) ====
JUBL was unveiled in 2006 and is considered to be JUGENE&#x27;s predecessor. It was decommissioned following JUGENE&#x27;s successful installation in mid-2008.

==== Jülich BlueGene/P supercomputer (JUGENE, 2008) ====

On 22 February 2008, the massively parallel supercomputer JUGENE, which was based on IBM&#x27;s BlueGene/P architecture, went into operation. At times, it was the fastest computer in Europe and the fastest civil computer in the world. In 2012, it was replaced by JUQUEEN.

==== HPC-FF and JuRoPA (2009) ====
On 26 May 2009, the two computers HPC-FF and JuRoPA went into operation. The two computers could be connected for specific tasks and together they achieved a performance of 274.8 teraflop/s with Linpack, which placed them tenth worldwide. The operating system was SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. This meant that three computers were effectively in operation in 2009. Both computers were decommissioned in June 2015 and replaced by JURECA.

* &quot;HPC-FF&quot; – A computer built by Bull for fusion research with 1080 cluster nodes, each with two Xeon quad-core processors (Xeon X5570, 2.93 GHz).
* &quot;JuRoPA&quot; was built by Sun with 4416 Xeon X5570 processors (2208 processor nodes).

==== JUQUEEN (2012) ====
The supercomputer known as JUQUEEN went into operation in 2012. It has a peak performance of 5.9 petaflop/s and was Europe&#x27;s fastest supercomputer at the time of its inauguration.

== Location and accessibility ==
Forschungszentrum Jülich is situated in the middle of the Stetternich Forest in Jülich (Düren district, North Rhine-Westphalia) and covers an area of 2.2 square kilometres. It is located about 4 km to the south-east of Jülich, approx. 30 km to the north-east of Aachen, and 45 km to the west of Cologne. Some of the facilities of Forschungszentrum Jülich are not located on campus but about 1 km west of campus on the premises of the former federal railways repair shop (BAW).

== Infrastructure ==
In addition to the scientific institutes and the large-scale facilities, Forschungszentrum Jülich has several infrastructure divisions and central institutes, including for example a Works Fire Brigade that is staffed 24/7, ready to protect people, property, animals, and the nature in and around Forschungszentrum Jülich. The aim of the work at the Medical Service is to ensure healthy working conditions at Forschungszentrum Jülich. The services offered range from occupational health and safety to emergency medical care and psychosocial counselling.

On campus, the State Institute for Occupational Safety &quot;(LAfA)&quot; for North Rhine-Westphalia operates a state collection centre for radioactive waste for North Rhine-Westphalia and Lower Saxony. This collection centre accepts radioactive waste from Forschungszentrum Jülich as well as other (low-level) radioactive waste from the two aforementioned federal states.

Since 1979, Forschungszentrum Jülich has also had its own railway track for freight transport, which is a dead-end track within campus.

<text>Rondell Bernard White (born February 23, 1972) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as an outfielder and designated hitter. In addition to being a solid defensive player, White also had a batting average of .300 or higher for four consecutive seasons from 1998 to 2001.

==Pre-Major League Baseball career==
White is a 1990 graduate of Jones County High School in Gray, Georgia, where he played baseball and basketball. He was the Atlanta Journal-Constitution&#x27;s Player of the Year in 1990 and was also selected to the &quot;USA Today&quot; and Collegiate Baseball All-America squads that year.

==Professional baseball career==
White was drafted by the Montreal Expos as the 24th overall pick in the first round of 1990 Major League Baseball draft as a compensation pick from the California Angels for signing Mark Langston. White played in the Expos&#x27; minor league system for four years from 1990 to 1994. In 1993, White posted an impressive .380 batting average in 42 games for the Ottawa Lynx of the International League, earning him a promotion to the Expos. He made his major league debut on September 1, 1993 at the age of 21.

On June 11, 1995, White had the best game of his career when he hit for the cycle and had 6 hits in 7 at bats during a thirteen-inning game against the San Francisco Giants. He became the fourth Expos player in team history to hit for the cycle (preceded by Tim Foli on April 22, 1976, Chris Speier on July 20, 1978, and Tim Raines on August 16, 1987). He had two singles, two doubles, an extra-inning triple, and a home run.

In 1997, White hit a career-high 28 home runs for the Expos. He also led the National League center fielders with 379 putouts and 3 double plays and finished the 1997 season ranked second in the league with a 2.7 Defensive Wins Above Replacement (WAR). On July 31, 2000, the Expos traded White to the Chicago Cubs for Scott Downs.

After playing two seasons for the Cubs, he signed a two-year deal with the New York Yankees on December 17, 2001. On March 19, 2003 he was traded from the Yankees to the San Diego Padres for Bubba Trammell and Mark Phillips. That year he was named as a reserve player for the National League team in the 2003 All-Star Game. On August 26, 2003 he was traded to the Kansas City Royals for Chris Tierney and Brian Sanches. He ended the 2003 season with a career-high 87 runs batted in between the two teams. After the season, he became a free agent and signed with the Detroit Tigers. After two seasons with the Tigers, he signed with the Minnesota Twins on December 22, 2005. White played in his final major league game on September 30, 2007, at the age of 35.

==Career statistics==
In a fifteen-year major league career, White played in 1,474 games, accumulating 1,519 hits in 5,357 at bats for a .284 career batting average along with 198 home runs, 768 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .336. He led the league in putouts in 1997, twice led the league in fielding percentage as an outfielder and retired with a .989 fielding percentage as a center fielder and a .985 fielding percentage as a left fielder, and overall with a .987 fielding percentage.

On December 13, 2007, White was mentioned in the Mitchell Report in connection to steroids.

<text>Abbé (from Latin &quot;abbas&quot;, in turn from Greek , &quot;abbas&quot;, from Aramaic &quot;abba&quot;, a title of honour, literally meaning &quot;the father, my father&quot;, emphatic state of &quot;abh&quot;, &quot;father&quot;) is the French word for an abbot. It is also the title used for lower-ranking Catholic clergy in France who are not members of religious orders.

==History==

A concordat between Pope Leo X and King François I of France (1516) gave the monarchs of France the right to nominate 255 commendatory abbots () for almost all French abbeys, who received income from a monastery without needing to render service, creating, in essence, a sinecure. 

From the mid-16th century, the title of &quot;abbé&quot; has been used in France for all young clergy, with or without consecration. Their clothes consisted of black or dark violet robes with a small collar, and they were tonsured.

Since such &quot;abbés&quot; only rarely commanded an abbey, they often worked in upper-class families as tutors, spiritual directors, etc.; some (such as Gabriel Bonnot de Mably) became writers.

Clerical oblates and seminarians of the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest also have the honorific title of &quot;abbé&quot;.

<doc id="1091696" wikidata="Q964149" url="?curid=1091696" title="The Hissing of Summer Lawns">
<text>The Hissing of Summer Lawns is the seventh studio album by the Canadian-American singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell, released in November 1975 on Asylum Records. It continues the jazz-influenced sound of Mitchell&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Court and Spark,&quot; with more unconventional and experimental material. It features synthesizers such as the Moog and ARP, sampling, backing from the jazz-rock groups the L.A. Express and the Jazz Crusaders, and contributions from James Taylor, David Crosby, and Graham Nash.

The lyrics focus on women&#x27;s experiences with patriarchal norms (&quot;Don&#x27;t Interrupt the Sorrow&quot;) or frustrations with suburban life (&quot;Harry&#x27;s House&quot;). As with many of her albums, Mitchell created the cover art. It depicts a painting of a group of men carrying a large snake superimposed over the Beverly Hills suburbs; Mitchell&#x27;s house is shaded in blue.

While it did not spawn a major hit single like its predecessor, &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; reached number 4 in the US and remains Mitchell&#x27;s last top-10 album. &quot;In France They Kiss on Main Street&quot;, the only single, reached number 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. 

&quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; initially received negative reviews, with critics finding the jazz stylings a disservice to Mitchell&#x27;s lyrics and comparing it negatively to &quot;Court and Spark&quot;. However, it later became one of her most acclaimed works. It appeared at number 258 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2020 edition of its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and at number 217 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; in 2000.

==Background==
The slick jazz-pop sound Mitchell developed on &quot;Court and Spark&quot; (1974) would be pushed into more adventurous territory on &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot;. Some tracks reflect a fusion of jazz and &quot;shimmering avant-pop&quot;. The album also uses an ARP synthesizer.

On &quot;The Jungle Line&quot;, Mitchell is credited with the first commercially released song to include a sample, featuring a looped recording of percussion by the African ensemble the Drummers of Burundi. This interest in world music presaged the work of Peter Gabriel and Paul Simon in subsequent years. In a 1983 interview for &quot;Musician Magazine&quot; Mitchell was asked what prompted her to use the drums. Mitchell explained: &quot;Because I loved that Burundi warriors passage. It had a Bo Diddley lick in it which I took out and made into a loop and then ran this black cultural poem under it. I thought I was black for about three years. I felt like there was a black poet trapped inside me, and that song was about Harlem—the primitive juxtaposed against the Frankenstein of modern industrialization; the wheels turning and the gears grinding and the beboppers with the junky spit running down their trumpets. All of that together with that Burundi tribal thing was perfect. But people just thought it was weird.&quot;

==Songs==

The first track, &quot;In France They Kiss on Main Street&quot;, is a jazz-rock song about coming of age in a small town in the 1950s rock &amp; roll era. (The song was released as the single from the album and reached number 66 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts.) &quot;The Jungle Line&quot; uses a field recording from Africa of the Drummers of Burundi (called &#x27;warrior drums&#x27; in the credits), onto which are dubbed guitar, Moog synthesizer and the vocal line. The lyrics pay homage to the works of the French Post-Impressionist painter Henri Rousseau. Mitchell blends details of his works with imagery of modern city life, the music industry and the underground drug culture.

&quot;Edith and the Kingpin&quot; marks a return to jazz in a story of a gangster&#x27;s new moll arriving in his home town. &quot;Don&#x27;t Interrupt the Sorrow&quot; is an acoustic guitar-based song with stream-of-consciousness lyrics, focused on women standing up to male dominance and proclaiming their own existence as individuals. &quot;Shades of Scarlett Conquering&quot; is an orchestral-based piece about a modern southern belle basing her life and self-image on the stereotypes of the Scarlett O&#x27;Hara character from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

The second side begins with the title track, &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot;, which is about a woman who chooses to stay in a marriage where she is treated as part of her husband&#x27;s portfolio. &quot;The Boho Dance&quot; comments on people who feel that artists betray their artistic integrity for commercial success, with an ironic glance at those who said this of Mitchell herself and parallels Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Painted Word&quot;. &quot;Harry&#x27;s House / Centerpiece&quot; concerns failing marriage as example of the loneliness of modern life and frames the jazz standard &quot;Centerpiece&quot; by Harry &quot;Sweets&quot; Edison and Jon Hendricks. &quot;Sweet Bird&quot; is a sparser acoustic track that is a slight return to Mitchell&#x27;s so-called &#x27;confessional&#x27; singer-songwriter style and addresses the loss of beauty power with ageing. Its lyrics indicate that it may also be a reference to Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;. The final track is &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;, consisting of many overdubs of her voice and an ARP String Machine (credited as an ARP-Farfisa on the album sleeve).

The African theme of &quot;The Jungle Line&quot; also features on the album sleeve, with an image of dark-skinned people carrying a large snake (both were embossed on the original vinyl album cover). Mitchell&#x27;s own house is marked in blue (green for the UK issue) on the back cover.

==Reception==
The album initially received harsh criticism. In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Stephen Holden wrote that the album&#x27;s lyrics were impressive but the music was a failure. &quot;If &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; offers substantial literature, it is set to insubstantial music... Four members of Tom Scott&#x27;s L.A. Express are featured on &quot;Hissing&quot;, but their uninspired jazz-rock style completely opposes Mitchell&#x27;s romantic style... &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; is ultimately a great collection of pop poems with a distracting soundtrack. Read it first. Then play it.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau called the musical accompaniment &quot;the most ambitious of her career,&quot; but criticized Mitchell&#x27;s choice of session musicians and opined that &quot;only on a couple of cuts — &#x27;The Jungle Line&#x27; and &#x27;Don&#x27;t Interrupt the Sorrow&#x27; — do these skillful sound effects strengthen the lyrics. The result is that Mitchell&#x27;s words must stand pretty much on their own.&quot;

The record&#x27;s reputation has grown in stature over the years. Music writer Howard Sounes has called &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; Mitchell&#x27;s masterpiece, &quot;an LP to stand alongside &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;&quot;. Prince, a lifelong fan of Mitchell, praised it in interviews; he reportedly called it &quot;the last album I loved all the way through.&quot; Critic Jessica Hopper of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; noted that the album was originally felt as a betrayal by some listeners, but stated that while &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have the rhapsodic rep as &quot;Blue&quot;, it&#x27;s unquestionably one of Mitchell&#x27;s finest albums, and it is certainly her most timeless.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1977, at the 19th Grammy Awards, Mitchell was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for the album.

It was voted number 217 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). The album was included in Robert Dimery&#x27;s &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. in 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the album at number 258 in the 2020 edition of its 500 greatest albums of all time.

==History==
The area, once part of the ancient &quot;Noricum&quot; province, in the 7th century was resettled by Slavic tribes, who lived within the Principality of Carantania. The migration concentrated around the former Roman settlement of &quot;Juenna&quot; (near present-day Globasnitz in an area later called &quot;Podjuna&quot; in Slovene or &quot;Jauntal&quot; in German. Up to today, significant parts of the population refer to themselves as Carinthian Slovenes. 

The descendants of Count Siegfried I of Sponheim, who about 1035 had come to the Duchy of Carinthia as a follower of Emperor Conrad II, had a trading post erected at the site about 1090, where a church was built soon afterwards at the behest of the archbishop of Salzburg. In 1217 Duke Bernhard von Spanheim gave orders to build a bridge across the Drava River and had the settlement rebuilt in 1231. Völkermarkt was granted town privileges in the 13th century already and developed quickly as an important centre for trade in iron from the surrounding ore mines.

In the Carinthian Plebiscite of 1920, a majority of the population voted for adhesion to the Republic of Austria. On 18 September 1979, the Yugoslav Department of State Security firebombed the Völkermarkt town hall, severely injuring three men, including two of the agents, and causing heavy damages.

==Population==
According to the 2001 census 2.6% of the population were Carinthian Slovenes.

==Transport==
The town has access to the Austrian Süd Autobahn (A2) with two junctions. The projected Koralm Railway is expected to improve the area&#x27;s transport facilities.

== Notable people ==
* Markus Hansiz (1683-1766), Jesuit and historian.
* Johann Joseph Peyritsch (1835-1889), physicician and botanist
* Julius Ringel (1889-1967), general of the Gebirgstruppe (Mountain troops) of the Wehrmacht
=== Sport ===
* Stephanie Graf (born 1973), athlete; silver medallist in the 800m at the 2000 Summer Olympics
* Elmar Lichtenegger (born 1974), hurdler, now subject to a lifetime ban
* Magdalena Lobnig (born 1990), rower, bronze medallist at the 2020 Summer Olympics

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Völkermarkt is twinned with:
* San Giorgio di Nogaro, Italy

<doc id="1091707" wikidata="Q4664329" url="?curid=1091707" title="Abbotsleigh">
<text>Abbotsleigh is an independent Anglican early learning, primary, secondary day, and boarding school for girls located in Wahroonga, on the Upper North Shore of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.
The school currently educates approximately 1,400 students from Transition (pre-school) to Year 12, including 170 boarders from Year 7 to 12.

Abbotsleigh is affiliated with various educational organizations, including the Alliance of Girls&#x27; Schools Australasia (AGSA), the Junior School Heads Association of Australia (JSHAA), the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), the Australian Boarding Schools&#x27; Association (ABSA), and a founding member of the Association of Heads of Independent Girls&#x27; Schools (AHIGS).

The school ranked first based on academic performance among independent schools in New South Wales from 2013 to 2015. In 2023, the school ranked tenth in the High School Certificate (HSC).

==History==
Abbotsleigh was founded by Marian Clarke in 1885 in a small terrace house in North Sydney. The school then moved to Parramatta; first to Honiton House, then to more spacious premises at the corner of Church and Marsden streets, a site now covered by a car park. The school proved successful in Parramatta, but in 1895 Clarke left 80 pupils behind to set out for a year in England to visit her family. The school declined during her absence, and on her return only a small number of boarders remained.

In 1930 a new headmistress, Gladys Gordon Everett, was chosen from a long list of candidates. Everett had been head of Pymble Ladies&#x27; College before she left to study in France. She had taught in France and England before she led Katanning Church of England Girls&#x27; School. In 1931 Gordon Everett arranged the students into houses and in 1933 the school celebrated founder&#x27;s day. In the same year the school began buying land and nearby houses. The school&#x27;s expansion plans involved more land purchases in 1937. The plans succeeded and by 1938 there was a waiting list for families who wanted to enrol their daughters. Gordon Everett taught lessons in Divinity and in French.

In 1939 new classrooms opened, but the waiting list continued to grow. Some schools closed during the Second World War, but Abbotsleigh continued.

By the time Gordon Everett retired in 1954, there were 660 students, a separate junior school had started, and there was still a waiting list.

Buildings that developed over the years include the Marian Clarke building facing the Pacific Highway, Vindin House, Lynton House, and Poole House on the junior campus. The last three are listed on the local government heritage register.

== Headmistresses ==
The following individuals have served as the Headmistress:
== Structure ==
Abbotsleigh has a total enrolment of approximately 1,400 girls across Years K–12. In 2016, the Senior School campus had an enrolment of approximately 900 girls in Years 7–12. The main high school is divided into the Middle School (Year Seven and Eight), Senior College Archdale (Year Nine and Ten), and Senior College (Year Eleven and Twelve).

Each house group within a year has a tutor, and every year is managed by a year coordinator, and overseen by the Dean of Middle School or Deans of Senior College.

There is also a nearby Junior School, also located in Wahroonga, which houses the Early Learning Centre, Transition and Kindergarten to Year Six. Each year, approximately two-thirds of the incoming Year Seven class at Senior School are from the Junior School, while the rest are drawn from schools in Sydney, from interstate and overseas, having passed selective entry examinations and/or interviews to gain an enrolment place.

The school council is responsible for the school&#x27;s governance. Kanishka Raffel, Archbishop of Sydney, serves as its chair.

==Campus==

The senior and junior campuses cater for 1400 students in total from Transition to Year 12 (Higher School Certificate).

===Junior Campus===
The Junior Campus is located on Woonona Avenue in Wahroonga. Poole House, the oldest building on the campus, serves as an after-school care and music center with music rooms for lessons. The campus includes a library, school hall, and administration center alongside junior classrooms.In 2002, a center for Years 4–6 was built around a grassy courtyard that features an arts facility and canteen. Sporting facilities include a large oval, outdoor pool, three tennis courts, and various play areas. An underground parking facility was completed in 2007, with kindergarten classrooms above it..

The new Early Learning Center was completed in January 2010. It includes a new Infants precinct and an Early Learning Centre for the youngest learners from birth to five years old. It is a seventy-place, coeducational center providing long day care. Girls of the age of 5 are now able to enter the school in the Transition class (preschool age), where they are able to make the smooth transition from preschool to kindergarten. The ELC is run according to the Reggio Emilia principles.

===Senior Campus===

The Senior Campus is located on the Pacific Highway and includes an auditorium, assembly hall, Senior Studies Centre, Aquatic Centre, and two gymnasiums. Sporting facilities feature 11 tennis courts, three indoor gyms, two weights gyms, two cricket nets, a 25-metre indoor pool, and two large ovals for hockey, touch football, and soccer, including a multi-purpose synthetic turf oval with spectator stands. A new library named the Abbotsleigh Research Centre (ARC) was built and officially opened on 2 April 2006. The ARC has won awards for its unique interior design. Vindin House was converted into the Grace Cossington Smith Gallery (named after Old Girl Grace Cossington Smith),

In addition to this, a new canteen was built in 2008 to join with the Saturday morning sports canteen, featuring new outdoor café-style eating areas overlooking the oval. The Judith Poole Sports Hall was built in 2015 an award-winning design at the 2018 World Architecture Awards.

==Motto and crest==
The Abbotsleigh motto, &quot;Tempus celerius radio fugit&quot;, may be translated from Latin as &quot;Time flies faster than the weaver&#x27;s shuttle&quot;. As the shuttle flies a pattern is woven; the shuttle of time also weaves a pattern of which the threads are people, buildings and events. The motto was given to the school by Marian Clarke, whose family crest was a weaver&#x27;s shuttle surrounded by the motto, &quot;Tempus fugit radio celerit&quot;. The school used this form until 1924, when it decided that the ungrammatical Latin should be changed to the present word order, which has been used ever since.

The reference to the weaver&#x27;s shuttle is also believed by many to be a reference to the &quot;proper&quot; place of women in terms of domestic duties/servitude to men. Some members of the school community have called for the motto to be changed to keep pace with modern views on feminine rights.

The 1934 edition of &quot;The Weaver&quot; explains the symbolism of the school crest: &quot;the lion for the strength in God, lillies for purity and fish as the symbol of Christianity through baptism.&quot;

== Associated schools ==
Abbotsleigh has a number of international sister schools and exchange agreements with other institutes, including the École Alsacienne in Paris, France, Ohtani High School, Japan, Beijing Yucai School, China, Annette-von-Droste-Hülshoff-Gymnasium in Münster, Germany, Miami&#x27;s Palmer Trinity School, Moreton Hall in Oswestry, England, Queenswood School in Hertfordshire, England, and Ridley College in Ontario, Canada. Girls have the opportunity to host an incoming exchange student or, in Years 9 and 10, to attend one or more of these schools on exchange for a period of one or two terms.

Abbotsleigh is also unofficially associated as the sister school to The King&#x27;s School, an independent Anglican day and boarding school for boys in North Parramatta, and Sydney Church of England Grammar School, an independent Anglican day and boarding school for boys in North Sydney.

Chamber groups such as String Quartets, Flute Ensemble, Brass Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble and Clarinet and Saxophone Ensemble are also available to girls without an audition. Girls are invited to participate in Choir, and may audition for smaller vocal groups such as Vocal Ensemble and Chamber Choir. Girls can also be involved in the Gospel Choir, which performs at various Chapel services throughout the year. These ensembles participate in multiple school-based events throughout the year, as well as eisteddfods and music festivals. There are also opportunities to participate in interstate and international music tours, musicals and gala concerts.

Abbotsleigh also offers an Extended Tuition music program from Kindergarten to Year 12, where girls have the opportunity to learn an instrument (piano, singing, woodwind, brass, strings or percussion instruments) from one of their Peripatetic instrumental teachers. Girls who are involved in this program are also encouraged to participate in their co‑curricular ensembles.

Additionally, Abbotsleigh&#x27;s Junior School offers a Year 2 String Program, where girls are required to learn either violin or cello. Girls in Year 3 participate in the Year 3 Instrumental Program, where they are introduced to a band instrument, such as flute, clarinet or trumpet. Girls then have the option of continuing these studies in the Extended Tuition music program and Junior School co‑curricular ensembles.

=== Performing arts ===
Abbotsleigh caters for a range of creative talents and provides an performing arts program. In addition to drama classes (compulsory in Middle School), it is offered as a subject in Senior College years and the HSC. Student-directed productions, Middle and Senior School plays, an annual &quot;Shakespeare festival&quot;, theatre sports and school musicals are included in the school calendar. Musicals and plays are often produced and performed in collaboration with Knox Grammar, a neighbouring boys&#x27; college.

=== Debating and public speaking ===
Abbotsleigh has a tradition of debating and public speaking. The school participates in several major competitions, including the Independent Schools Debating Association (ISDA), consisting of 32 private schools, the Archdale Debating Competition established in honour of former headmistress Miss Betty Archdale, also involving over 20 schools and the Sydney Debating Network (SDN). Abbotsleigh has consistently achieved championship results in these competitions, fostered due to extensive coaching and development squad programs. Girls also often debate at representative level in AHIGS and NSW state squads.

Abbotsleigh also participates in several public speaking competitions including Rostrum Voice of Youth, Legacy Public Speaking, SMH Plain English Speaking Award and AHIGS Festival of Speech.

==House system==
The house system was introduced by Miss Everett, and is similarly based upon that of Dr Arnold&#x27;s house system at Rugby School. The &quot;Weaver&quot; for May 1931 explains: &quot;Points are awarded for work, conduct and sport and a shield will be presented annually to the winning House&quot;. The &quot;Malloch Shield&quot;, given the following year by A Malloch, was won for the first time by Sturt.

In the junior school there are five houses:

In the senior school there are eight houses:

The house system has been modified over time to reflect the changing needs of the school, and its increased enrolment. One of the most significant changes occurred in the late 1960s under then Headmistress Betty Archdale. Senior school houses had previously been named after well-known male Australian poets, and Archdale introduced new house names recognising accomplished Australian women. This was the basis for the senior school houses in use today. Houses now compete for the House Choir banner and the Spirit Cup, as well as the Sports Cup.

<doc id="1091721" wikidata="Q3328057" url="?curid=1091721" title="Murder (song)">
<text>&quot;Murder&quot; is the eighth single by British band New Order.

Released on the Belgian Factory Benelux label in 1984, it is an instrumental piece that contains samples of dialogue from the films &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Caligula&quot;. It was recorded in winter 1982 during the sessions for the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot;.

The B-side is an instrumental version of the previous single by the group, &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;.

&quot;Murder&quot; was only released in Belgium as a single, but was available in the UK on import and made number 92. As such, it is the band&#x27;s only release to miss the UK Top 75.

== Sleeve ==
The single&#x27;s cover design by Peter Saville was based on a &#x27;metaphysical&#x27; painting by Giorgio de Chirico. It forms a set with &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;.

== Covers ==
The Charlatans covered the song as an exclusive download for their 2008 single &quot;Oh! Vanity&quot;. The Charlatans&#x27; lead singer Tim Burgess is a notable fan of the band and has cited &quot;Power, Corruption &amp; Lies&quot; as his favourite album.

It was also covered by K-X-P and the track included on the &quot;Power Corruption &amp; Lies Covered&quot; CD (free with the February 2012 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine).

==Releases==
As well as the original single, both tracks are available on the CD version of 1987&#x27;s compilation, &quot;Substance&quot;, although neither track appears on the LP issue. &quot;Murder&quot; does not appear on Disc 1 of &quot;Substance&quot;, which otherwise contains versions of every New Order single A-side up to 1987. It instead appears on disc 2, which otherwise contains versions of every New Order B-side through 1987 (including &quot;Thieves Like Us (Instrumental)&quot;). The double cassette version of &quot;Substance&quot; (FACT200c) has &quot;Murder&quot; correctly located between &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Kiss&quot; on the A-sides cassette, but omits it from the track listing, instead incorrectly listing it as being on the B-sides cassette.

<doc id="1091733" wikidata="Q3502372" url="?curid=1091733" title="Sub-culture (song)">
<text>&quot;Sub-culture&quot; is the tenth single by English rock band New Order. It was released as the second and final single from their third studio album, &quot;Low-Life&quot; (1985) on 28 October 1985 by Factory Records.

==Release==
The single release, remixed by John Robie, is a drastic departure from the album version of the track. Robie&#x27;s 12&quot; and 7&quot; single mixes feature more club-oriented, electronic instrumentation and prominent soulful female backing vocals.

The B-side is an instrumental remix titled &quot;Dub-vulture&quot;. An alternate seven-inch edit of the Robie remix taken from the Benelux version of the &quot;Sub-culture&quot; single appears on the group&#x27;s 1987 compilation, &quot;Substance&quot;. This version also appears on the US 12&quot; alongside the longer mixes.

A collection of Razormaid remixes of the track were released in 1986, which include additional vocals by Deborah Iyall of Romeo Void.

==Artwork==
&quot;Sub-culture&quot; has only a regular black sleeve, as graphic designer Peter Saville reportedly deemed the mix of the song unworthy of his talents. Saville&#x27;s input was present only in a P/S/A (Peter Saville Associates) credit for typography.
However this rumour was debunked in 2017 when Saville stated, &quot;I never had the authority to say that there shouldn&#x27;t be a sleeve. No, all I can presume is that one was not asked for.&quot;

<doc id="1091736" wikidata="Q506672" url="?curid=1091736" title="Michael Michai Kitbunchu">
<text>Michael Michai Kitbunchu (, ; born 25 January 1929) is a Thai prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Bangkok from 1973 to 2009 and was made a cardinal in 1983. He has been the Protopriest of the College of Cardinals since 14 December 2016. He is the first cardinal from Thailand. He was president of the Thai Episcopal Conference from 1979 to 1982 and from 2000 to 2006. Kitbunchu is currently the longest serving cardinal.

==Early life and ministry==
Kitbunchu was born in Sam Phran, a district of the Nakhon Pathom Province, to a family of Chinese descent and studied at the minor seminary of Si Racha. He then furthered his studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, where he obtained a licentiate in both philosophy and theology. While in Rome, he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian on 20 December 1959.

He returned to Thailand and served as assistant pastor and then pastor in Bang Kham, and later became pastor of Calvary Parish in Bangkok. He was also an archdiocesan consultor and served as rector of the metropolitan seminary of Bangkok from 1965 to 1972.

==Episcopal career==
On 18 December 1972, Pope Paul VI appointed Kitbunchu the second Archbishop of Bangkok. He received his episcopal consecration on 3 June 1973 from Archbishop Joseph Khiamsun Nittayo, with Bishops Lawrence Thienchai Samanchit and Michel-Auguste–Marie Langer, MEP, serving as co-consecrators. He served as President of the Thai Episcopal Conference from 1979 to 1982, and again from 2000 to 2006.

Pope John Paul II created him Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna in the consistory of 2 February 1983; he was the first cardinal from Thailand. Kitbunchu was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2005 papal conclave that selected Pope Benedict XVI. He denied funeral Masses to drug traffickers, saying that such people &quot;destroy society&quot; and engage in &quot;acts of indirect murder.&quot; He once expressed his opposition to abortion by saying, &quot;Abortion is a great crime, because the one who should protect the child in her womb becomes the one who destroys the child.&quot;

During the 2006 political crisis in his Thailand, Kitbunchu called for unity, saying, &quot;All Thai people are patriotic and want the country to progress and develop on all fields, but now the political crisis has disturbed and worried the people.&quot; He also asked Thais to &quot;correct what is wrong and forgive each other.&quot;

Kitbunchu resigned from his position as Archbishop of Bangkok on 14 May 2009. At the time of his retirement, he was the oldest active head of an archdiocese in the Latin Church. In addition to his native language, Central Thai (official and national) and his ethnic Chinese dialect of Teochew, he can also speak other languages such as Latin, English, Italian, French and Standard Mandarin.

From the death of Roger Etchegaray in 2019, Kitbunchu and Alexandre do Nascimento were tied as the longest-tenured members of the College of Cardinals, both having been appointed in 1983. After do Nascimento&#x27;s death on September 28, 2024, Kitbunchu became the sole longest-tenured member of the College.

<doc id="1091766" wikidata="Q2353540" url="?curid=1091766" title="Krasnikov tube">
<text>A Krasnikov tube is a speculative mechanism for space travel involving the warping of spacetime into permanent superluminal tunnels. The resulting structure is analogous to a wormhole or an immobile Alcubierre drive (and like them requires exotic matter with negative energy density) with the endpoints displaced in time as well as space. The idea was proposed by Sergey Krasnikov in 1995.

==Structure==
The tube is a distortion of spacetime that can be intentionally created (using hypothetical technology) in the wake of travel near the speed of light. The Krasnikov tube allows for a return trip that takes travelers back to the time right after they left. Experiencing the effect requires that the traveler race along the tube at speeds close to that of light.

==Causality violations==

===One-tube case===

Krasnikov argues that despite the time-machine-like aspects of his metric, it cannot violate the law of causality (that a cause must always precede its effects in all coordinate systems and along all space-time paths) because all points along the round-trip path of the spaceship always have an ordered timelike separation interval (in algebraic terms, is always larger than ). This means, for example, that a light-beam message sent along a Krasnikov tube cannot be used for back-in-time signaling.

===Two-tube case===
While one Krasnikov tube can be seen to present no problems with causality, it was proposed by Allen E. Everett and Thomas A. Roman of Tufts University that two Krasnikov tubes going in opposite directions can create a closed timelike curve, which would violate causality.

For example, suppose that a tube is built connecting Earth to a star 3000 light-years away. The astronauts are travelling at relativistic velocities, so that the journey through this Tube I only takes 1.5 years from their perspective. Then the astronauts lay down tube II rather than travelling back in tube I, the first tube they produced. In another 1.5 years of ship time they will arrive back on Earth, but at a time 6000 years in the future of their departure. But now that two Krasnikov tubes are in place, astronauts from the future can travel to the star in tube II, then to Earth in tube I and will arrive 6000 years earlier than their departure. The Krasnikov tube system has become a time machine.

In 1993, Matt Visser argued that the two mouths of a wormhole with an induced clock difference could not be brought together without causing quantum field and gravitational effects that would either make the wormhole collapse or the two mouths repel each other. (See Time travel using wormholes and the Chronology protection conjecture.) It has been suggested that a similar mechanism would destroy time-machine Krasnikov tubes. That is, vacuum fluctuation would grow exponentially, eventually destroying the second Krasnikov tube as it approaches the timelike loop limit, in which causality is violated.

<doc id="1091767" wikidata="Q7049089" url="?curid=1091767" title="Non-well-founded set theory">
<text>Non-well-founded set theories are variants of axiomatic set theory that allow sets to be elements of themselves and otherwise violate the rule of well-foundedness. In non-well-founded set theories, the foundation axiom of ZFC is replaced by axioms implying its negation.

The study of non-well-founded sets was initiated by Dmitry Mirimanoff in a series of papers between 1917 and 1920, in which he formulated the distinction between well-founded and non-well-founded sets; he did not regard well-foundedness as an axiom. Although a number of axiomatic systems of non-well-founded sets were proposed afterwards, they did not find much in the way of applications until the book Non-Well-Founded Sets by Peter Aczel introduces hyperset theory in 1988.

The theory of non-well-founded sets has been applied in the logical modelling of non-terminating computational processes in computer science (process algebra and final semantics), linguistics and natural language semantics (situation theory), philosophy (work on the Liar Paradox), and in a different setting, non-standard analysis.

== Details ==
In 1917, Dmitry Mirimanoff introduced the concept of well-foundedness of a set:

:A set, x0, is well-founded if it has no infinite descending membership sequence formula_1

In ZFC, there is no infinite descending ∈-sequence by the axiom of regularity. In fact, the axiom of regularity is often called the &quot;foundation axiom&quot; since it can be proved within ZFC− (that is, ZFC without the axiom of regularity) that well-foundedness implies regularity. In variants of ZFC without the axiom of regularity, the possibility of non-well-founded sets with set-like ∈-chains arises. For example, a set &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot; is non-well-founded.

Although Mirimanoff also introduced a notion of isomorphism between possibly non-well-founded sets, he considered neither an axiom of foundation nor of anti-foundation. In 1926, Paul Finsler introduced the first axiom that allowed non-well-founded sets. After Zermelo adopted Foundation into his own system in 1930 (from previous work of von Neumann 1925–1929) interest in non-well-founded sets waned for decades. An early non-well-founded set theory was Willard Van Orman Quine’s New Foundations, although it is not merely ZF with a replacement for Foundation.

Several proofs of the independence of Foundation from the rest of ZF were published in 1950s particularly by Paul Bernays (1954), following an announcement of the result in an earlier paper of his from 1941, and by Ernst Specker who gave a different proof in his Habilitationsschrift of 1951, proof which was published in 1957. Then in 1957 Rieger&#x27;s theorem was published, which gave a general method for such proof to be carried out, rekindling some interest in non-well-founded axiomatic systems. The next axiom proposal came in a 1960 congress talk of Dana Scott (never published as a paper), proposing an alternative axiom now called SAFA. Another axiom proposed in the late 1960s was Maurice Boffa&#x27;s axiom of superuniversality, described by Aczel as the highpoint of research of its decade. Boffa&#x27;s idea was to make foundation fail as badly as it can (or rather, as extensionality permits): Boffa&#x27;s axiom implies that every extensional set-like relation is isomorphic to the elementhood predicate on a transitive class.

A more recent approach to non-well-founded set theory, pioneered by M. Forti and F. Honsell in the 1980s, borrows from computer science the concept of a bisimulation. Bisimilar sets are considered indistinguishable and thus equal, which leads to a strengthening of the axiom of extensionality. In this context, axioms contradicting the axiom of regularity are known as anti-foundation axioms, and a set that is not necessarily well-founded is called a hyperset.

Four mutually independent anti-foundation axioms are well-known, sometimes abbreviated by the first letter in the following list:
# AFA (&quot;Anti-Foundation Axiom&quot;) – due to M. Forti and F. Honsell (this is also known as Aczel&#x27;s anti-foundation axiom);
# SAFA (&quot;Scott’s AFA&quot;) – due to Dana Scott,
# FAFA (&quot;Finsler’s AFA&quot;) – due to Paul Finsler,
# BAFA (&quot;Boffa’s AFA&quot;) – due to Maurice Boffa.
They essentially correspond to four different notions of equality for non-well-founded sets. The first of these, AFA, is based on accessible pointed graphs (apg) and states that two hypersets are equal if and only if they can be pictured by the same apg. Within this framework, it can be shown that the equation &quot;x&quot; = {&quot;x&quot;} has one and only one solution, the unique Quine atom of the theory.

Each of the axioms given above extends the universe of the previous, so that: V ⊆ A ⊆ S ⊆ F ⊆ B. In the Boffa universe, the distinct Quine atoms form a proper class.

It is worth emphasizing that hyperset theory is an extension of classical set theory rather than a replacement: the well-founded sets within a hyperset domain conform to classical set theory.

== Applications ==
In published research, non-well-founded sets are also called hypersets, in parallel to the hyperreal numbers of nonstandard analysis.

The hypersets were extensively used by Jon Barwise and John Etchemendy in their 1987 book &quot;The Liar&quot;, on the liar&#x27;s paradox. The book&#x27;s proposals contributed to the theory of truth. The book is also a good introduction to the topic of non-well-founded sets.

<text>Vereeniging ( ; ) is a city located in the south of Gauteng province, South Africa, situated where the Klip River empties into the northern loop of the Vaal River. It is also one of the constituent parts of the Vaal Triangle region and was formerly situated in the Transvaal province. Vereeniging is the third largest city in Gauteng. The name &quot;Vereeniging&quot; is the Dutch word meaning &quot;association&quot;, although the spelling has since changed to &quot;vereniging&quot;, with a single &quot;e&quot;.

== Geographical information ==

Vereeniging is situated in the southern part of Gauteng Province, and forms the southern portion of the Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeninging (PWV) conurbation, and its neighbors are Vanderbijlpark (to the west), Three Rivers (east), Meyerton (north) and Sasolburg (south). The city is currently one of the most important industrial manufacturing centres in South Africa, with its chief products being iron, steel, pipes, bricks, tiles and processed lime.

The predominant language in Vereeniging is English followed closely by Sesotho language and Afrikaans.

== History ==

In 1879, George William Stow was commissioned by the Orange Free State government to look for coal deposits in the Bethlehem district With no deposits found he moved northwards to &quot;Maccauvlei&quot; on the Vaal River and then crossed the river to the Transvaal side. On the farm &quot;Leeuwkuil&quot;, he found a coal deposit twelve feet thick. But the Orange Free State government believed that the deposit was too far away and there was a lack of transport so turned down the idea of mining there. 

Stow settled in Kimberley to find a job, where he met Samuel Marks. After hearing Stow&#x27;s story, Marks saw an opportunity to use the coal for energy generation at the Kimberley diamond fields. Marks formed &quot;De Zuid Afrikaanshe en Oranje Vrystaatsche Kolen and Mineralen Vereeniging&quot; (The South African and Orange Free State Coal and Mineral Association) and sent Stow to purchase the farms where the coal was found. On 25 November 1880 he purchased the 12,000 acre farm &quot;Leeuwkuil&quot; for £5,000. Marks&#x27; agent J.G. Fraser also purchased the 6,000 acre &quot;Klipplaatdrift&quot; farm from Karl August Pistorius in October 1881 for £15,500. This was opposite the farm &quot;Maccauvlei&quot;. 

From 1881, coal was taken by ox-wagon to Kimberley, and by 1882 there was so much development around the mining area that a village was surveyed on the two former farms. The &quot;Volksraad&quot; agreed to name it Vereeniging, a shortened version of the company&#x27;s name.

===Second Boer War===
The Treaty of Vereeniging ending the Second Boer War (1899–1902) was negotiated here by delegates of the South African Republic, the Orange Free State, and the British Empire. During the conflict, a concentration camp was set up in the area by the British in September 1900, and by October 1901 it housed 185 men, 330 women, and 452 children. Conditions at the camp were very poor: drinking water was brought by cart from a fountain (there was no direct water supply although it was situated next to the Vaal River) and there were only 24 latrines. Most inmates lived in bell-tents but there was a dispensary and a school.

The concentration camp was situated where the Mittal Steel plant (Vaal Works) is situated. Today, the Maccauvlei Golf Course is on the opposite side of the Vaal River to where the concentration camp was, and a Garden of Remembrance is situated at Maccauvlei. All the British soldiers killed in and around Vereeniging during the war were re-buried on this site.

===Apartheid===
 Near Vereeniging is the predominantly black community of Sharpeville, Gauteng, the site of the Sharpeville massacre in 1960.

===Post-Apartheid===
Since 1999 its municipal services were provided by the Emfuleni Local Municipality. In 2018 the municipality was placed under administration after years of wasteful practices and poor service delivery. In February 2022 it was reported that Vereeniging had 14 out-of-service police vehicles for visible policing, and only 20 operational vehicles.

=== Flooding 2011 ===
In December 2010 and January 2011 the southern part of Gauteng and Mpumulanga experienced a higher than normal rainfall. This resulted in the need to release more water from the nearby Vaal dam. As a consequence, parts of Vereeniging, Three Rivers and the rest of the towns downstream were flooded.

== Trade and industry ==

The city&#x27;s motto is &quot;Per Pacem ad Industriam&quot; (&quot;Through Peace to Industry&quot;). It is currently one of the most important industrial manufacturing centres in South Africa, with its chief products being iron, steel, pipes, bricks, tiles and processed lime. Several coal mines are also still situated in the area, with reserves being estimated at four billion tons. Other mines nearby extract fire-clay, silica and building stone. Vereeniging also has several Eskom thermal power plants that supply electricity to the nearby goldmines.

The latest annual crime statistics for Vereeniging Police Precinct was issued by the South African Police Service (SAPS) in 2021. The SAPS crime report showed the following information:

==Coat of arms==

Vereeniging established a municipality in 1912. By 1931, the town council had assumed an emblem depicting bridge across a river, and two clasped hands.

The town council obtained a coat of arms from the College of Arms in October 1955, registered it with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in October 1957 and with the Bureau of Heraldry in June 1987.

The arms were : &quot;Sable, on a fess wavy Or a barrulet wavy Tenne, the fess between in chief a thunderbolt between two picks, Or, and in base a steel pipe palewise proper between two cogwheels, also Or&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, the design is a black shield displaying, from top to bottom, a golden heraldic thunderbolt between two picks, a wavy orange stripe edged in gold, and an upright golden pipe between two cogwheels.

The crest was a dove of peace perched on two clasped hands; the supporters were a lion and a zebra standing on a grassy base strewn with veld flowers; and the motto was &quot;Per pacem ad industriam&quot;.

<doc id="1091775" wikidata="Q4634534" url="?curid=1091775" title="30 Seconds to Fame">
<text>30 Seconds to Fame is an American television series that was shown on the Fox Network from July 17, 2002 to June 26, 2003, featuring a talent show where acts could only last up to 30 seconds each, regardless of any resolution to the act. The series was hosted by Craig Jackson.

Many different talents were exhibited, such as contortionism, juggling, magic tricks, stand-up comedy, and beatboxing, in addition to singing and dancing acts. Much of the charm of the show was derived from the fact that each act lasted only 30 seconds, leading to a variety of different acts being displayed. The live audience acted as the judges. During the performances, if the audience found an act undesirable to watch, they booed and used electronic devices to put in a vote for elimination, complete with an on-screen &quot;Eliminator&quot; scale graphic (colored in green, yellow, and red). If enough people did so (i.e. the &quot;Eliminator&quot; scale needle hit any part of the red area), the act was to be cut short, regardless of how much time was left on the clock.

At the end of the show, every member of the audience voted for his or her favorite act, and the top three acts got a chance to do another 30-second performance. After this, a final round of voting occurred, and the winner earned a cash prize of US$25,000.

The network began to rerun the series on their Saturday late night block in January 2011 in order to fill the half-hour after &quot;Fringe&quot; which was vacated by the canceled &quot;Running Wilde&quot;, until the launch of the &quot;Animation Domination High Definition&quot; block in July 2013; the late night timeslot was used for repurposed reruns of recent Fox series after Fox temporarily ending original late night programming in September 2010.

<doc id="1091790" wikidata="Q6779566" url="?curid=1091790" title="Mary Foote">
<text>Mary Foote (November 25, 1872 – January 28, 1968) was an American painter and producer of notes of Carl Jung&#x27;s seminars. As an artist, she lived and worked in New York&#x27;s Washington Square, Paris and Peking. From 1928 to the 1950s she lived in Zürich and created and published notes of Carl Jung&#x27;s seminars until World War II. She returned to the United States in the 1950s and spent her later years in Connecticut, where she died.

==Early life==
Mary Foote was the daughter of Charles Spencer Foote and Hannah Hubbard Foote. She was born in Guilford, Connecticut, as was her younger sister, Margaret Foote Hawley, who also became an artist and painted a profile portrait of a girl named Mary Foote. After the girls were orphaned, Margaret was raised by her aunt, Harriet Foote Hawley and her husband in Washington, D.C. Mary was taken in by an aunt who lived in Hartford, Connecticut after she became an orphan at the age of 13.

Her cousin was Lilly Gillette Foote, who was governess to Mark Twain&#x27;s children. For a period of time Mary Foote lived in the Mark Twain (Samuel L. Clemens) household and was friends with Susy Clemens.

Mary Foote was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, the great-great-granddaughter of General Andrew Ward (1727-1799) and Diana Hubbard Ward. Ward, who was born and died in Guilford, Connecticut, was commended for his bravery by George Washington. Foote&#x27;s grandparents were George Augustus Foote and Eliza Spencer and her great-grandparents were Eli Foote and Diana Ward.

==Career==

===Art===
Beginning in 1890, she studied art at Yale School of Art. In 1894, the Alice Kimball English Prize, which was established to support summer travel, was awarded to Foote. The William Wirt Winchester Prize, which funded two years of study in Europe, was awarded to Foote in 1897; It was considered the &quot;largest prize of its kind&quot; in the United States at that time. Foote travelled to Paris, France and studied with John Singer Sargent. She was a student of Frederick MacMonnies at the Académie Carmen in Paris and at Giverny; the gardens there became the subject of many of her paintings. She also made a portrait painting of MacMonnies. Her friends included art patron Mabel Dodge, dancer Isadora Duncan, author Henry James, writer Gertrude Stein, James McNeill Whistler, Ellen Emmet Rand, and Cecilia Beaux.

In 1901, she returned to New York City to set up a studio on Washington Square where she earned a comfortable living from her portrait commissions; her list of clients reads as a Who&#x27;s Who of the art scene of her day. Foote painted a wide range of subjects including portraits, figures, florals, and landscapes.

Her work was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, along with the works of Robert Henri, Cecilia Beaux, Edmund Tarbell and other noted artists. Her work was described as follows:
 At the Armory Show in 1913, she exhibited &quot;Old Lady&quot;.

Foote lived and worked in Peking, China from December 1926 into early 1927.

During the 1920s, she shared her studio and had a relationship with Frederick MacMonnies. She went into a deep depression after it ended. She sought treatment from Smith Ely Jelliffe, and in 1927, closed down her studio. One of her friends, Robert Edmond Jones, a stage designer in New York, had been a analysand of Carl Jung and Toni Wolff. He advised Foote, who has been described as neurotic, to seek the treatment of Jung in Zürich, Switzerland.

===Carl Jung===
After closing her studio, Foote went to Zürich to see Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Beginning in 1928, she worked for Jung, first transcribing his seminars and editing Jung&#x27;s English phrasing, and then producing the bound copies for their participants. For instance, her notes became the basis for &quot;The Visions Seminars,&quot; which was published in 1976. Her secretary and assistant from the 1930s until the seminar series ended with the start of World War II was an Englishwoman, Mrs. Emily Köppel, who was married to a man from Switzerland. The work was paid for by subscriptions, and supplemented initially by Mary Foote, and later by Mary and Paul Mellon and Alice Lewisohn Crowley.

In the 1930s, Foote had a secret liaison with Harvard-educated German businessman and Nazi, Ernst Hanfstaengl. She returned to Connecticut shortly before her death; her obituary listed her as having been Jung&#x27;s &quot;secretary.&quot;

She was among the social circle of Mabel Dodge Luhan and visited her at her Villa Curonia. A fellow friend, Muriel Draper, said of Foote:

She was also described as a tall, elegant woman. Mary Mellon, wife of Paul Mellon, said of her, &quot;She has great style. From her you will learn about the feeling relationships among people there. She is very frail, and I&#x27;m afraid not very well. Take her to dinner at the Baur-au-Lac and feed her on champagne and caviar.&quot;

==Later years and death==
In the 1950s, Foote returned to Connecticut.
She died among friends on January 28, 1968, and is buried in the Foote-Ward Cemetery in Guilford, Connecticut. Her papers are with the Yale University Library.

<text>Charles&quot;Carl&quot;Panzram (June 28, 1892 – September 5, 1930) was an American serial killer, spree killer, mass murderer, rapist, child molester, arsonist, robber, thief and burglar. In prison confessions and in his autobiography, Panzram confessed to having murdered twenty-one boys and men, only five of which could be corroborated; he is suspected of having killed more than a hundred boys and men in the United States alone, and several more in Portuguese Angola.

Panzram also confessed to having committed more than a thousand acts of rape against males of all ages. After a lifetime of crime, during which he served many prison terms and escaped from many prisons, Panzram was executed by hanging in 1930 for the murder of a prison employee at the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas.

== Early life ==
Carl Panzram was born on June 28, 1892, on a farm near East Grand Forks, Minnesota, the sixth of seven children born to East Prussian immigrants Johann &quot;John&quot; Gottlieb Panzram and Mathilda Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Panzram (&quot;née&quot; Bolduan).

Panzram and his six siblings were made to work on the family farm from a young age until truancy laws came into effect. Panzram&#x27;s parents, angry about having their children sent to school during the day, forced them to work in the fields throughout the night instead; Panzram later reported he would receive just two hours of sleep before he would have to get up for school. Punishments in the household ranged from being bound by chains to being starved.

Panzram later reflected on his early childhood with the sentiment that he was not liked by other children; by the age of five he claimed that he was a liar and thief, and recalled that he became meaner the older he grew. Panzram&#x27;s father abandoned the family when he was seven years old. Eventually, four of his five older brothers left as well; one of them drowned.

=== Early criminal record ===

Panzram&#x27;s run-ins with the law started in 1899, at age 8, when he was charged in juvenile court with being drunk and disorderly, and in 1903, at age 11, when he was arrested and jailed for being drunk and &quot;incorrigible.&quot; Not long after this second arrest, Panzram stole cake, apples and a revolver from a neighbor&#x27;s home.

In October 1903, Panzram&#x27;s mother sent him to the Minnesota State Training School, purportedly a reform school; Panzram later wrote in his autobiography, however, that he was repeatedly beaten, tortured and raped by staff members, in a workshop the children dubbed &quot;the paint shop&quot; due to leaving the room &quot;painted&quot; with bruises and blood. Panzram hated the school so much that he decided to burn it down, and did so successfully and without detection on July 7, 1905.

In January 1906, Panzram was paroled from Red Wing Training School, where he had been detained after stealing money from his mother&#x27;s pocketbook. By his early-teens Panzram exhibited alcoholism and had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, mostly for burglary and robbery offenses. At age 14, a couple of weeks after his parole and two weeks after attempting to kill a Lutheran cleric with a revolver, Panzram ran away from home to live on the streets. He often traveled via train cars, and later recalled having been gang raped by a group of homeless men on one of these occasions.

== Crimes ==
=== Early crimes ===
In the summer of 1906, Panzram was arrested for burglary in Butte, Montana, and sentenced to one year&#x27;s imprisonment at Montana State Reform School in Miles City. He later claimed that after a guard punished him, he assaulted and critically injured the man with a wooden board; as punishment, Panzram had to spend some time in solitary confinement. The following year, Panzram and a fellow inmate named James Benson escaped from Montana State Reform School and stole guns in Terry, Montana. In the coming weeks, Panzram and Benson repeatedly broke into stores and burned down buildings, especially churches, in acts of arson. In Fargo, North Dakota, the two men separated.

Later in 1907, after getting drunk in a saloon in Helena, Montana, Panzram enlisted in the United States Army and was assigned to the 6th Infantry at Fort William Henry Harrison. Refusing to take orders from officers and being generally insubordinate, he was convicted of larceny for stealing $80 worth of supplies and served a prison sentence in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, between 1908 and 1910, with U.S. Secretary of War William Howard Taft officially approving Panzram&#x27;s sentence. Panzram later claimed that while he had been a &quot;rotten egg&quot; before imprisonment at the military penitentiary, &quot;any shred of goodness left in him was smashed out&quot; during his time at Fort Leavenworth.

After his release and dishonorable discharge, Panzram resumed his criminal activities as a thief. Stealing items that ranged from bicycles to yachts, he was caught and imprisoned multiple times. He served prison sentences both under his own name and various aliases in: Fresno, California; Rusk, Texas; The Dalles, Oregon; Harrison, Idaho; Butte, Montana; Montana State Prison; Oregon State Penitentiary; Bridgeport, Connecticut (as &quot;John O&#x27;Leary&quot;); Sing Sing Correctional Facility, New York; Clinton Correctional Facility, New York; and Washington, D.C., and Leavenworth, Kansas. While incarcerated, Panzram frequently attacked guards and refused to follow their orders. The guards retaliated, subjecting him to beatings and other punishments.

In his autobiography, Panzram wrote that he was &quot;rage personified&quot; and that he would often rape men whom he had robbed. He was noted for his large stature and great physical strength—due to years of hard labor at Leavenworth and other prisons—which aided him in overpowering most men; he also engaged in vandalism and arson. By his own admission, one of the few times Panzram did not engage in criminal activities was when he was employed as a strikebreaker against union employees. On one occasion, he tried to sign aboard as a ship&#x27;s steward on an Army transport vessel but was discharged when he reported to work intoxicated. The last thing that he had stolen before he was caught was a radio.

=== Escalating violence ===
Panzram claimed in his autobiography that after escaping from a chain gang sentence at Rusk, Texas, he went to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, in the winter of 1910 to try to enlist in the &quot;Federales&quot;. He took a train to Del Rio, Texas, and got off in a small town east of El Paso. He later claimed to have abducted, assaulted and strangled a man about a mile from the town and then stolen $35 from the victim.

In the summer of 1911, Panzram, going by the alias &quot;Jefferson Davis&quot;, was arrested in Fresno, California, for stealing a bicycle. He was sentenced to six months in county jail, but escaped after thirty days. Panzram later claimed that after his escape, while riding on a boxcar in California, he disarmed an armed man he either called a &quot;railway detective&quot; or a &quot;railway brakeman&quot;, whom he then forced to rape a homeless man at gunpoint, before throwing both of them off the train. He proceeded to Oregon, where he made a living as a logger.

Panzram admitted years later that once, when hiding in a bordello, his wallet was stolen and he was infected with gonorrhea; he also became paranoid. In 1913, Panzram, going by the alias &quot;Jack Allen&quot;, was arrested in The Dalles, Oregon, for highway robbery, assault and sodomy. He broke out of jail after two months. He was later arrested in Harrison, Idaho, but again he escaped from county jail. He was again arrested in Chinook, Montana, and sentenced to one year in prison for burglary, to be served at the Montana State Prison.

On April 27, 1913, Panzram, using his &quot;Jefferson Davis&quot; alias, was admitted to the Montana State Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana. He escaped on November 13. Within a week, he was arrested for burglary in Three Forks, giving his name as &quot;Jeff Rhoades&quot;. He was incarcerated at Deer Lodge for an additional year. By his own account he committed sodomy while imprisoned. Panzram was released on March 3, 1915, with a new suit of clothing, $5 and a ticket to the next town six miles away. He rode the rails through Washington State, Idaho, Nebraska and South Dakota via the Columbia River. On June 1, he burglarized a house in Astoria, Oregon, where he was soon arrested while attempting to sell some of the stolen items.

Under the name &quot;Jeff Baldwin&quot;, Panzram was sentenced to seven years in prison, to be served at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, where he was taken on June 24, 1915. Fifty-year-old Warden Harry Minto believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other disciplinary measures. Later, Panzram stated that he swore he &quot;would never do that seven years and I defied the warden and all his officers to make me.&quot; Later that year, Panzram helped fellow inmate Otto Hooker escape from the prison. While attempting to evade recapture, Hooker killed Minto. This event marked Panzram&#x27;s first known involvement in a murder, as an accessory before the fact. In his prison record which noted his two aliases, &quot;Jefferson Davis&quot; and &quot;Jeff Rhodes&quot;, he falsely gave his age as 30, and his place of birth as Alabama. His only truthful statement was when he stated his occupation as &quot;thief&quot;.

Panzram was disciplined several times while at Salem, including sixty-one days in solitary confinement, before escaping on September 18, 1917. After two shootouts, in which he attempted to shoot Chief Deputy Sheriff Joseph Frum, Panzram was recaptured and returned to the prison. On May 12, 1918, he escaped again by sawing through the bars of his cell and caught a freight train heading east. He began going by the name &quot;John O&#x27;Leary&quot; and shaved off his mustache to change his appearance. Panzram would never return to the Pacific Northwest. He allegedly ended up in New York City, got a Seaman Identification card and sailed on the steamship &quot;James S. Whitney&quot; to Panama. There, he tried to steal a small boat with the help of a drunken sailor, who killed everyone on board and was arrested. Still free, Panzram travelled to Peru to work in a copper mine. After that, he traveled to Chile; Port Arthur, Texas; London; Edinburgh; Paris and Hamburg.

=== Murder spree ===
In 1920, Panzram committed a robbery in Newport, Rhode Island. On September 16, 1920, he burglarized the Taft Mansion in New Haven, Connecticut, a residence of William Howard Taft, by that time a former U.S. President. Panzram specifically targeted the mansion out of animus he had been holding against Taft since his incarceration at Fort Leavenworth. He stole a large amount of jewellery and bonds, as well as Taft&#x27;s Colt M1911 .45 caliber handgun.

Using Taft&#x27;s stolen money, Panzram bought a small sailing yacht, the &quot;Akista&quot;, and embarked on an eight-year-long murder spree which spanned several countries and involved multiple victims. Sailing south to New York City, for three months Panzram lured sailors away from port bars onto the yacht, made them drunk before raping them and then murdered the men with Taft&#x27;s stolen pistol, subsequently dumping their bodies near Execution Rocks Light in Long Island Sound. Panzram later claimed to have killed ten men in this manner. The sailor murders ended only after &quot;Akista&quot; ran aground and sank near Atlantic City, New Jersey, during which his last two potential victims escaped to parts unknown. On October 26, Panzram was arrested in Stamford, Connecticut, for burglary and possession of a loaded handgun. In 1921, he served six months in jail in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

After being released, Panzram caught a ship to southern Africa and landed in Luanda, the capital of colonial Portuguese Angola. By late 1921, Panzram was foreman of an oil rig in Angola, which he later burned down out of what he said was &quot;spitefulness.&quot; Shortly after, he decided to seek out a virgin girl. Panzram paid a resident Angola family 80 escudos (US$8) and, in exchange, was given a 12-year-old girl, whom he raped in his shack that night. He returned the girl to her family demanding his money back on suspicion of the girl not being an actual virgin. The family then gave Panzram an 8-year-old girl, whom he also raped in his shack, but who was eventually taken back to the family because he suspected that she too was not a virgin. He then claimed that he raped and killed an Angolan boy estimated to be eleven or twelve years old. In his confession to this murder, he wrote: &quot;His brains were coming out of his ears when I left him and he will never be any deader.&quot; He also claimed that he hired a boat with six rowers, shot the rowers with a Luger pistol and threw their bodies to the crocodiles.

After his return to the U.S., Panzram asserted he raped and killed two small boys, beating one to death with a rock on July 18, 1922, in Salem, Massachusetts, and strangling the other later that year near New Haven. After his murder spree in Salem, Panzram worked as a night watchman in Yonkers, New York, north of Manhattan, at the Abeeco Mill factory. In Providence, Rhode Island, he stole a yawl and sailed to New Haven, seeking victims to rob and rape, and boats to steal. In June 1923, in New Rochelle, New York, Panzram stole a yacht belonging to the local police chief. He picked up a 15-year-old boy named George Walosin and promised him a job on the boat, but instead sodomized him.

On June 27, on the river near Kingston, New York, Panzram claimed to have picked a man up but, believing the man was going to attempt to rob him, used a .38 caliber pistol from the stolen yacht to kill the John Doe victim. Panzram threw the body into the river. On June 28, Panzram and Walosin docked at Poughkeepsie. Panzram stole $1,000 worth of fishing nets. At Newburgh, Walosin, having witnessed the murder the day before, jumped overboard and swam to shore. He reported to police in Yonkers that he had been sexually assaulted by Panzram. An alert went out for &quot;Captain John O&#x27;Leary&quot;. On June 29, &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; was arrested in Nyack.

On July 9, Panzram tried to escape from jail. He later conned his lawyer by giving him ownership of a stolen boat in return for bail money. He then skipped bail, and the boat was confiscated by government agents. On August 26, &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; was arrested in Larchmont, New York, after breaking into a train depot. Three days later, on August 29, &quot;O&#x27;Leary&quot; was cleared as a suspect in the stabbing death of Dorothy Kaufman of Greenburgh, committed a month prior. He was sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment for the break-in. While in county jail, he confessed to the alias &quot;Jeff Baldwin&quot;, and that he was wanted in Oregon for the murder of Minto. After first being imprisoned in Sing Sing Prison, in October, Panzram was imprisoned at Clinton Prison in Dannemora as Inmate #75182. While there he tried to escape but ended up with an injured spine and broken ankles. He was discharged in July 1928, and he allegedly committed another murder that summer in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Final capture==

On August 30, 1928, Panzram was arrested in Baltimore for a Washington, D.C., burglary – stealing a radio and jewelry from the home of a dentist on August 20. Three men were also arrested as accomplices and most of the jewelry was recovered. Panzram gave his correct name, although he lied by claiming his age as 41 and that he was from Nevada. During his interrogation, he confessed to killing three young boys earlier that month – one in Salem, one in Connecticut, and a 14-year-old newsboy in Philadelphia. Panzram&#x27;s confession to killing a boy at Pier 28 on League island near Philadelphia in August 1928 was confirmed. Boston police were unable to corroborate his other confession, the murder of a boy in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Panzram later wrote that he had contemplated mass murders and other acts of mayhem, such as poisoning a city&#x27;s water supply with arsenic, or scuttling a British warship in New York Harbor to provoke a war between the United States and Britain.

In light of his extensive criminal record, Panzram was sentenced to 25-years-to-life. Upon arriving at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, identified as inmate #31614, he warned the warden: &quot;I&#x27;ll kill the first man that bothers me&quot;. Because he was considered too psychotic, he was assigned to work alone in the prison laundry room, where the foreman, Robert Warnke, was known to bully and harass other prisoners under him. Warnke soon antagonized Panzram, despite the latter repeatedly warning him to back off. On June 20, 1929, Panzram beat Warnke to death with an iron bar. He was convicted and sentenced to death. He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote: &quot;The only thanks you and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one neck and that I had my hands on it.&quot;

While on death row, Panzram was befriended by an officer named Henry Philip Lesser, who would give him money to buy cigarettes. Panzram was so astonished by this act of kindness that, after Lesser provided him with writing materials, Panzram wrote a detailed summary of his crimes and nihilistic philosophy while awaiting execution. Panzram explicitly denied having any remorse for any of his actions and began his journal with the statement that: &quot;In my lifetime I have murdered 21 human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons and, last but not least, I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all these things I am not in the least bit sorry. I have no conscience so that does not worry me.&quot;

==Execution==
Panzram was hanged on September 5, 1930. As officers attempted to place the customary black-hood over his head, he spat in the executioner&#x27;s face. When asked for any last words, he responded: &quot;Yes. Hurry it up, you Hoosier bastard; I could kill a dozen men while you&#x27;re screwing around!&quot;

== Legacy ==
Former prison guard Henry Lesser preserved Panzram&#x27;s letters and autobiographical manuscript. He spent the next four decades trying to have this material published. In 1980, Lesser donated Panzram&#x27;s materials to the San Diego State University, where they are housed as the &quot;Carl Panzram papers&quot; in Malcolm A. Love Library. Writers Thomas E. Gaddis and Joe Long co-wrote &quot;&quot; (1970). They had consulted with Lesser who let them draw from Panzram&#x27;s manuscript for their work. In 2005, Fantagraphics Books published Joe Coleman&#x27;s comic book &quot;Muzlers, Guzzlers, and Good Yeggs&quot;, which included a section dedicated to the life and times of Carl Panzram.

===Films===
The Yugoslav film &quot;Strangler vs. Strangler&quot; (&quot;Davitelj protiv davitelja&quot;) (1984), about an ostensible serial killer, opens with a Panzram quote: &quot;I wish you all had one neck and my hands were around it.&quot; The German horror film &quot;Schramm&quot; begins with a quote of Panzram: &quot;Today I am dirty, but tomorrow I&#x27;ll be just dirt.&quot; Filmmaker John Borowski released a documentary, &quot;Carl Panzram: The Spirit of Hatred and Vengeance&quot; (2012). Also, the 1995 film, &quot;&quot;, starred James Woods as Carl Panzram.

<text>Igor Rostislavovich Shafarevich (; 3 June 1923 – 19 February 2017) was a Soviet and Russian mathematician who contributed to algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. Outside mathematics, he wrote books and articles that criticised socialism and other books which were described as anti-semitic. 

==Mathematics==
From his early years, Shafarevich made fundamental contributions to several parts of mathematics
including algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic algebraic geometry. In particular, in algebraic number theory, the Shafarevich–Weil theorem extends the commutative reciprocity map to the case of Galois groups, which are central extensions of abelian groups by finite groups.

Shafarevich was the first mathematician to give a completely self-contained formula for the Hilbert pairing, thus initiating an important branch of the study of explicit formulas in number theory. Another famous (and slightly incomplete) result is Shafarevich&#x27;s theorem on solvable Galois groups, giving the realization of every finite solvable group as a Galois group over the rationals. 

Another development is the Golod–Shafarevich theorem on towers of unramified extensions of number fields.

Shafarevich and his school greatly contributed to the study of algebraic geometry of surfaces. He started a famous Moscow seminar on classification of algebraic surfaces that updated the treatment of birational geometry around 1960 and was largely responsible for the early introduction of the scheme theory approach to algebraic geometry in the Soviet school. His investigation in arithmetic of elliptic curves led him, independently of John Tate, to the introduction of the group related to elliptic curves over number fields, the Tate–Shafarevich group (usually called &#x27;Sha&#x27;, and denoted as &#x27;Ш&#x27;, the first Cyrillic letter of his surname). 

He contributed the Grothendieck–Ogg–Shafarevich formula and to the Néron–Ogg–Shafarevich criterion. 

With former student Ilya Piatetski-Shapiro, he proved a version of the Torelli theorem for K3 surfaces.

He formulated the Shafarevich conjecture, which stated the finiteness of the set of Abelian varieties over a number field having fixed dimension and prescribed set of primes of bad reduction. The conjecture was proved by Gerd Faltings as a partial step in his proof of the Mordell conjecture.

Shafarevich&#x27;s students included Yuri Manin, Alexey Parshin, Igor Dolgachev, Evgeny Golod, Alexei Kostrikin, Suren Arakelov, G. V. Belyi, Victor Abrashkin, Andrey Todorov, Andrey N. Tyurin, and Victor Kolyvagin. 

He was a member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in the department of Mathematics, Physics and Earth Sciences.
In 1960, he was elected a Member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 1981, he was elected as a foreign member of the Royal Society.

In 2017, Shafarevich was awarded the Leonhard Euler Gold Medal by the Russian Academy of Sciences.

==Soviet politics==
Shafarevich came into conflict with the Soviet authorities in the early 1950s but was protected by Ivan Petrovsky, the Rector of Moscow University. He belonged to a group of Pochvennichestvo-influenced dissidents who endorsed the Eastern Orthodox tradition. Shafarevich published a book, &quot;The Socialist Phenomenon&quot; (French edition 1975, English edition 1980), which was cited by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in his 1978 address to Harvard University.

In the 1970s, Shafarevich, with Valery Chalidze, Grigori Podyapolski and Andrei Tverdokhlebov, became one of Andrei Sakharov&#x27;s human rights investigators and so was dismissed from Moscow University. Shafarevich opposed political interference in universities. 

==&quot;The Socialist Phenomenon&quot;==
Shafarevich&#x27;s book &quot;The Socialist Phenomenon&quot;, which was published in the US by Harper &amp; Row in 1980, analyzed numerous examples of socialism from ancient times to various medieval heresies and a variety of modern thinkers and socialist states. From those examples, he claimed that all the basic principles of socialist ideology derive from the urge to suppress individualism. &quot;The Socialist Phenomenon&quot; consists of three major parts:

# Chiliastic Socialism: Identifies socialist ideas amongst the ancient Greeks, especially Plato, in numerous medieval heretic groups such as the Cathars, Brethren of the Free Spirit, Taborites, Anabaptists, in various religious groups during the English Civil War, in modern writers such as Thomas More, Tommaso Campanella and numerous Enlightenment writers in 18th-century France.
# State Socialism: Describes the socialism of the Incas, the Jesuit state in Paraguay, Mesopotamia, Egypt and China.
# Analysis: Identifies three persistent abolition themes in socialism: the abolition of private property, the abolition of the family, and the abolition of religion (mainly but not exclusively Christianity)

Shafarevich argued that ancient socialism (such as Mesopotamia and Egypt) was not ideological, as an ideology socialism was a reaction to the emergence of individualism in the Axial Age. He compared Thomas More&#x27;s (&quot;Utopia&quot;) and Tommaso Campanella&#x27;s (&quot;City of the Sun&quot;) visions with what is known about the Inca Empire and concluded that there are striking similarities. He claimed that we become persons through our relationship with God and argued that socialism is essentially nihilistic and is unconsciously motivated by a death instinct. He concluded that we have the choice of pursuing death or life.

==Religious views==
Shafarevich adhered to Russian Orthodox Christianity and incorporated the neo-Platonic views of Eastern Orthodoxy into his understanding of the relation of mathematics and religion.

In his talk to the Göttingen Academy of Sciences upon receiving a prize, Shafarevich presented his view of the relationship between mathematics and religion. He noted the multiple discoveries in mathematics, such as that of non-Euclidean geometry, to suggest that pure mathematics reflects an objective reality, not a set of conventional definitions or a formalism. He claimed that the growth of mathematics itself is not directed or organic. To have a unity and direction, mathematics needs a goal. It can be practical applications or God as the source for the direction of development. Shafarevich opted for the latter, as pure mathematics is not in itself driven by practical applications.

==Russian politics==

On 21 December 1991 he took part in the first congress of the Russian All-People&#x27;s Union, headed by Sergei Baburin. In October 1992, he became a member of the founding committee of the National Salvation Front. In 1993, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the State Duma with Mikhail Astafyev&#x27;s Constitutional Democratic Party - Party of Popular Freedom.

Shafarevich was a member of the editorial board of the magazine &quot;Nash Sovremennik&quot; and in 1991–1992 of the editorial board of &quot;Den&quot; of Alexander Prokhanov, which was banned in October 1993 following the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis and later reopened under the title &quot;Zavtra&quot;. In 1994, he joined the &quot;All-Russian National Right Wing Centre&quot;, led by Mikhail Astafyev.

==Accusations of antisemitism==
Shafarevich&#x27;s essay &quot;Russophobia&quot; was expanded into his book &quot;Three Thousand-Year-Old Mystery&quot; (Трехтысячелетняя загадка) and resulted in accusations of antisemitism. He completed the &quot;Russophobia&quot; essay in 1982 and it was initially circulated as &quot;samizdat&quot;. In the Soviet Union, it was first officially published in 1989. At the same time, Shafarevich condemned the methods that were used to screen out applicants of Jewish origin when entering prestigious Moscow universities in the 1970s and early 1980s.

In &quot;Russophobia&quot;, he argued in the essay that great nations experience periods in their history of reformist elitist groups (&#x27;small nations&#x27;) having values that differ fundamentally from the values of the majority of the people but gaining the upper hand in the society. In Shafarevich&#x27;s opinion, the role of such a &#x27;small nation&#x27; in Russia was played by a small group of intelligentsiya, dominated by Jews, &quot;who were full of hatred against traditional Russian way of life and played an active role in the terrorist regimes of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin&quot;.

Its publication led to a request by the United States National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to Shafarevich to resign his membership, because the NAS charter prohibited stripping an existing membership. In an open letter to the NAS, Shafarevich explained that &quot;Russophobia&quot; is not antisemitic. Shafarevich also noted that since NAS enlisted him without his request or knowledge, delisting him was its internal matter. Nevertheless, when the United States invaded Iraq, Shafarevich faxed his resignation.

Accusations of antisemitism continued and involved Shafarevich&#x27;s other publications. Semyon Reznik targets the &quot;Russophobia&quot; essay for factual inaccuracies: Shafarevich misassigned Jewish ethnicity to a number of non-Jews involved in the execution of Nicholas II, repeated the false assertion of graffiti in Yiddish at the murder site and suggested that Shafarevich&#x27;s phrase &quot;Nicholas II was shot specifically as the &quot;Tsar&quot;, and this ritual act drew a line under an epoch in Russian history&quot; – is read by some as a blood libel. (An accusation which ignores the remainder of Shafarevich&#x27;s sentence: &quot;so it can only be compared with the execution of Charles I in England or of Louis XVI in France&quot;.) Aron Katsenelinboigen wrote that Shafarevish&#x27;s work &quot;lives up to the best traditions of antisemitic propaganda&quot;.

Later, Shafarevich expanded on his views in his book &quot;Three Thousand-Year-Old Mystery&quot; in which he further claimed that Jews effectively marginalise and exclude non-Jews in all types of intellectual endeavors. The work was published in Russian in 2002; an introductory section explains the relationship with the &quot;Russophobia&quot; essay, explaining that the essay developed from an appendix to an intended work of wider scope, which he started writing in &quot;samizdat&quot;.

In 2005, Shafarevich was amongst the signatories of the Letter of 5000.

The issue of Shafarevich&#x27;s alleged antisemitism has been the subject of a 2009 doctoral thesis at the University of Helsinki, which was later turned into a book in which the author, Krista Berglund, stated that Shafarevich&#x27;s views have been misconstrued as antisemitic.

<text>Pickled pigs&#x27; feet is a type of pork associated with the cuisine of the Southern United States, Mexico, China, French Canada, and Scandinavia.

The feet of domestic pigs are typically salted and smoked in the same manner as other pork cuts, such as hams and bacon. It is common to preserve them in a manner very similar to home canning and processes for pickled vegetables; typically a saturation of hot vinegar brine is used. Such methods allow them to be preserved without the need for refrigeration until the jar is opened. They were once popular in American bars.

<doc id="1091821" wikidata="Q2632719" url="?curid=1091821" title="Rastriya Prajatantra Party">
<text>The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (; ; , ()) is a constitutional monarchist and Hindu nationalist political party in Nepal.

The party was formed by Panchayat era prime ministers Surya Bahadur Thapa and Lokendra Bahadur Chand in 1990. The party led two coalition governments in 1997 under Thapa and Chand. The two were also appointed prime minister by King Gyanendra in the 2000s; Chand in 2002 and Thapa in 2003.

Rajendra Prasad Lingden is currently serving as party chairman after being elected at the party&#x27;s general convention in December 2021. Rastriya Prajatantra Party is currently the fifth-largest political party in the House of Representatives after winning 14 seats at the 2022 general election and is one of seven national parties recognized by the Election Commission. The party was briefly part of the ruling coalition government following the election, but has been in opposition since 25 February 2023.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years, 1990–1994 ===
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party was formed by the ruling elite of the Panchayat era on 29 May 1990. The party split in the same year after another group also registered itself with the Election Commission. The two parties had the same name, ideology and statute but different flags and election symbols. The two parties, one led by Surya Bahadur Thapa zand the other led by Lokendra Bahadur Chand, contested the 1991 elections. The two parties won four seats between them with Chand&#x27;s party winning three seats and Thapa&#x27;s party winning one seat. Following their performance at the elections the two parties agreed to merge into a single Rastriya Prajatantra Party on 8 February 1992.

The party held its first general convention from in 1992 from 11 to 16 June in Kathmandu and unanimously elected Surya Bahadur Thapa as its chairman. Lokendra Bahadur Chand and Rajeshwor Devkota were elected leader and co-chairman, respectively. The party emerged as a third force at the 1992 local elections and the 1994 general elections. The party received 18 percent of the votes and won 20 seats to the House of Representatives, making them the third largest party in the parliament.

=== Government and second split, 1995–1999 ===

==== Coalition governments, 1995–1997 ====
The party initially supported the minority government of CPN (UML) but later withdrew their support and backed a no-confidence motion Manmohan Adhikari. The party then joined a coalition government with Nepali Congress and Nepal Sadbhawana Party under the premiership of Congress leader Sher Bahadur Deuba. A faction of the party led by former prime minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand were dissatisfied with the coalition government and in March 1996 some cabinet ministers close to Chand withdrew their support for the Deuba government and resigned before a no-confidence vote was set to table by the opposition CPN (UML). The ministers withdrew their resignation before the no-confidence vote and Deuba won the confidence vote. Six cabinet ministers close to Chand again resigned from the government in December 1996 but supported Deuba in the confidence vote later and rejoined the cabinet.

==== Chand and Thapa governments, 1997–1998 ====
In March 1997 a faction of the party led by Lokendra Bahadur Chand joined a coalition government with CPN (UML), with Chand as prime minister. On 3 October 1997, the faction led by Surya Bahadur Thapa voted for a no-confidence motion tabled by Nepali Congress and toppled the government. Thapa was then made the prime minister on 6 October 1997 with the support of Congress.

After losing support within his party Thapa asked King Birendra to dissolve the house and call for fresh elections. After the recommendation of the Supreme Court, the king called forth a special session of the parliament to debate the no-confidence motion filed against Thapa. Thapa survived the no-confidence vote and expelled six central committee members for threatening to back a no-confidence motion against him.

The second general convention of the party took place from 12 to 16 November 1997 in Birgunj. Surya Bahadur Thapa was re-elected for a second term as chairman. Prakash Chandra Lohani, Pashupati SJB Rana and Kamal Thapa were nominated as vice-chairman, general secretary and spokesman respectively. Lokendra Bahadur Chand however created his own Rastriya Prajatantra Party on 9 January 1998 claiming that Thapa had mismanaged the party, did not listen to the directions of the central committee and accused Thapa of not holding the general election in a fair manner. He broke off with 10 members of parliament including 8 from the House of Representatives and 2 from the National Assembly. Thapa resigned as prime minister on 10 April 1998 and was replaced by Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala.

The two parties contested the 1999 elections and fared badly in the election with the party winning 11 seats and the party led by Chand not winning any seats. Following the elections, the parties decided to merge again on 31 December 1999. A group led by Rajeshwar Devkota however decided not to rejoin the party and formed their own Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Nationalist).

=== Direct rule and internal conflicts, 2002–2015 ===

==== Second Chand and Thapa governments, 2002–2006 ====

The king dismissed the government of Sher Bahadur Deuba on 4 October 2002 after failing to conduct the elections following the dissolution of the House of Representatives on May earlier that year. Lokendra Bahadur Chand was then appointed as prime minister on 11 October 2002. He resigned on 31 May 2003 after protests from opposition parties calling for the restoration of the parliament and the formation of a national consensus government. Chand had also faced accusations from within his party of failing to address these issues. He was replaced by Surya Bahadur Thapa on 5 June 2002.

At the third general convention of the party held in Pokhara from 12 to 14 December 2002, Surya Bahadur Thapa completed his second four-year term as party chairman and could not compete for the post of chairman again as per the party constitution. Pashupati SJB Rana was elected chairman during the convention and Padma Sundar Lawati, Kamal Thapa and Rosan Karki were nominated vice-president, general secretary and spokesperson respectively.

There were calls within the party for Surya Bahadur Thapa to resign as prime minister for undermining democracy by failing to form a national consensus government. He resigned on 7 May 2004 and was replaced by Nepali Congress (Democratic) leader Sher Bahadur Deuba. On 4 November 2004, Thapa announced that he would be quitting the party and forming a new centre-right liberal party. The party was formally launched on 13 March 2005 as Rastriya Janashakti Party.

On 1 February 2005, King Gyanendra dismissed Deuba as prime minister and seized executive powers. The party announced their support for the pro-democracy agitation led by the Seven Party Alliance but ten members of the party&#x27;s central committee, including Kamal Thapa who had rejoined the party after leaving for Janashakti, supported the coup. Thapa along with six central committee members were appointed to the King&#x27;s cabinet in December 2005 with Thapa becoming Home Minister.

On 10 January 2006, members of the central committee close to Kamal Thapa voted to replace Pashupati SJB Rana as party chairman with Thapa. Thapa&#x27;s claim as new chairman was dismissed by other members of the party. Thapa&#x27;s faction of the party contested the 2006 local elections that was boycotted by the Seven Party Alliance and the Rana faction of the party. The party won mayoral positions in major cities including Kathmandu, Pokhara, Bharatpur and Dhangadhi in an election marred by a lack of candidates, violence and low turnout. The party members that supported Thapa, including six incumbent cabinet ministers, were expelled. On 28 October 2006, they formed their own party, the royalist Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal, under the leadership of Kamal Thapa.

==== Constituent Assembly, 2007–2015 ====
The party held its fourth general convention from 9 to 11 December 2007 and re-elected Pashupati SJB Rana as party chairman. Following the 2006 revolution a national consensus government under the leadership of Girija Prasad Koirala was formed. The parliament was reinstated and eventually transformed into the Interim Legislature Parliament after including the Maoists. The party had eight seats in the parliament but two MPs, Budhhiman Tamang and Brijesh Kumar Gupta, were dismissed because of their support of the royal coup.

In the 2008 elections the party failed to win a seat from the constituency vote but got 2.45% of the party list votes and won 8 seats to the 1st Constituent Assembly through the party-list proportional representation system. Party chairman Pashupati SJB Rana also lost from Sindhupalchowk 1. On 28 May 2008, at the first session of the 1st Constituent Assembly. The party voted in favor of abolishing the monarchy and turning Nepal into a republic. Lokendra Bahadur Chand who was serving as the parliamentary party leader of the party was absent during the vote. The party joined the Madhav Kumar Nepal led government in June 2009.

At the party&#x27;s fifth general convention from 17 to 19 May 2013, the Rastriya Janashakti Party merged into the party and Surya Bahadur Thapa was elected as the chairman of the unified party. It was also decided that the senior leadership would rotate annually between Surya Bahadur Thapa, Lokendra Bahadur Chand, Pashupati SJB Rana and Prakash Chandra Lohani. In the 2013 elections, the party won constituency seats in Rupandehi 2, Chitwan 5 and Dhankuta 2 and got 2.75% of the party list votes and won 10 seats through the party-list proportional representation system for a total of 13 seats in the 2nd Constituent Assembly. The party supported the CPN (UML)–Nepali Congress coalition government under Sushil Koirala following the election and sent two ministers to the cabinet.

=== Federal Nepal, 2016–present ===
==== Continued internal conflicts, 2016–2020 ====
On 21 November 2016, the party announced its unification with the Kamal Thapa led Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal. The new party retained the name of Rastriya Prajatantra Party. The new party had a total strength of 37 in the Parliament of Nepal, becoming the fourth largest party. Thapa was elected as chairman of the party in a special general convention in Kathmandu in February 2017. The party joined the coalition government on 9 March 2017 under CPN (Maoist Centre) chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal with Kamal Thapa serving as deputy prime minister. Prakash Chandra Lohani split away from the party following the decision to join the government and because of issues regarding the electoral symbol of the party. He announced the formation of Ekikrit Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Nationalist) on 29 March 2017. Another split occurred on 6 August 2017 after Pashupati SJB Rana broke away forming Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Democratic). The party joined the coalition government under Nepali Congress president Sher Bahadur Deuba on 13 October 2017 with Kamal Thapa again serving as deputy prime minister.

In the 2017 general and provincial elections, Rastriya Prajantatra Party formed an alliance with Nepali Congress and Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Democratic). The party only won one seat to the House of Representatives and party chairman Kamal Thapa lost in Makwanpur 1. Only general secretary Rajendra Lingden was elected from Jhapa 3 after forging an electoral pact with the Left Alliance against Nepali Congress in some eastern districts including Jhapa. The party got 2.06% of the party list votes and could not become a national party after failing to pass the 3% threshold in party list voting. The party also won one seat each to provincial assemblies of Province 1, Province 3 and Province 6.

==== Re-unification and new leadership, 2020–present ====

The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (Samyukta), created through the merger of Rana and Lohani&#x27;s splinter groups, merged with the party on 12 March 2020, with Kamal Thapa, Pashupati Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana and Prakash Chandra Lohani all acting as chairs. In July 2020, Sunil Bahadur Thapa, the son of former prime minister Surya Bahadur Thapa, resigned from the party and joined Nepali Congress. The party conducted its general convention from 1 to 3 December 2021 and elected Rajendra Prasad Lingden as the party&#x27;s chairman. He defeated former deputy prime minister and incumbent party chairman Kamal Thapa at the general convention. The party also announced that it had 150,000 active party members. The general convention also elected Nepalgunj mayor Dhawal Shamsher Rana as the party&#x27;s general secretary and former member of constituent assembly Bikram Pandey as the party vice-president. Following the general convention, Kamal Thapa left the party and revived the Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal.

The party announced intentions to unify other pro-monarchist groups under their umbrella and groups including &quot;Nepal Ka Lagi Nepali&quot; Campaign, &quot;Mission Nepal&quot;, &quot;Gorach Abhiyan&quot; and the Gyanendra Shahi led &quot;Hamro Nepal Hami Nepali&quot; Campaign joined the party in the following months. Former chairman of Bibeksheel Sajha Party, Rabindra Mishra also joined the party on 28 September 2022 as senior vice-president.

The party fielded 140 candidates to the House of Representatives at the 2022 general and provincial elections and forged an election pact with CPN (UML) in Jhapa, Banke and Rupandehi districts. Party chairman Rajendra Lingden retained his seat in Jhapa 3 and the party gained 6 more direct seats. The party also got 5.58% of the party list vote to become one of seven national parties in the Federal Parliament. The party won 7 proportional seats for a total of 14 seats at the House of Representatives. The party was also successful in winning seats to all seven provincial assemblies.

== Ideology ==
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party was established as an alternative force to the major political parties, Nepali Congress and Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist). The party was founded on the principles of democracy, constitutional monarchy, nationalism and economic liberalism. At the time of the party&#x27;s foundation Surya Bahadur Thapa&#x27;s party was considered as the more liberal party and Lokendra Bahadur Chand&#x27;s party was considered as the more conservative party.

=== Monarchy and federal structure ===
At the first session of the 1st Constituent Assembly, the party voted to abolish the monarchy and turn Nepal into a secular republic. Later however, the party advocated for turning Nepal into a Hindu republic. Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal, a splinter group of the party which had voted against abolishing the monarchy changed its constitution to support the re-establishment of the Hindu state and a return to constitutional monarchy. After the merger between the two parties in November 2016 it was announced that the unified party would take up the constitution of Rastriya Prajatantra Party Nepal. The party has stated support for a &quot;Sanatan&quot; Hindu state with full religious freedom and registered an amendment proposal for such on 19 March 2017. The Election Commission removed the portion of the party statute that advocated for a Hindu state and monarchy on 17 March 2017 and asked the party to remove the provisions again on 22 January 2022 claiming that it was against Article 260 of the Constitution of Nepal.

The party supports a ceremonial monarch, a directly elected prime minister and a fully proportional parliament. The party also calls for the scrapping of the provincial governments claiming that it is an expensive experiment. The party wants to instead strengthen the local governments and create a two-tier federal structure.

<doc id="1091823" wikidata="Q942171" url="?curid=1091823" title="Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud">
<text>The Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud is a luxury automobile produced by Rolls-Royce Limited from April 1955 to March 1966. It was the core model of the Rolls-Royce range during that period. The Silver Cloud replaced the Silver Dawn and was, in turn, replaced by the Silver Shadow. The John P. Blatchley design was a major change from the pre-war models and the highly derivative Silver Dawn. As part of a range rationalisation, the Bentley S1 was made essentially identical, apart from its radiator grille and badging.

==Models==
===Silver Cloud===

Construction is body-on-frame, which permitted special bodied versions, though the overwhelming majority were built with the standard Pressed Steel Company manufactured steel body shell. A light-weight aluminium alloy was used for doors, bonnet/hood and boot/trunk lid. The chassis is a simple steel box section, welded together and very rigid. The car is long, wide, and weighs 1.95 tonnes. The engine is a 155 hp / 4000 rpm six-cylinder unit with inlet over exhaust valves: twin SU carburettors were added in September 1957. The standard transmission was a four-speed automatic, the General Motors designed Hydramatic transmission. The turning circle was .

Brakes are hydraulic and assisted by the Rolls-Royce mechanical servo with drums and suspension was independent coils at the front and semi-elliptic springs at the rear. Twin brake master cylinders were incorporated from April 1956.

Power steering and air conditioning became available as options in 1956.

A long-wheelbase version lengthened by was also made available in September 1957, outwardly very similar to the existing car but offering improved leg space for rear-seat passengers.

The British &quot;Motor&quot; magazine tested a standard-wheelbase factory-bodied Series I in 1956 recording a top speed of and acceleration from 0- in 13.5 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £5078 including taxes.

The coachbuilder Harold Radford offered conversions of the 4-door saloon into an estate car. One of these conversions, chassis no. LSMH65, sold in March 2017 for $583,000 (inclusive of applicable buyer&#x27;s fee) at RM Sotheby&#x27;s Amelia Island auction.


===Silver Cloud II===

The Silver Cloud II was introduced in 1959. It was little changed externally, but was given a new Rolls-Royce developed 6.2 L V8 engine, which pushed the weight to 2.11 tonnes. Performance was greatly improved and top speed was raised to , but the main improvements were in acceleration and torque. Power steering became standard. Electrically operated windows were now available as an option.

Although the improved performance of the new car was welcomed, commentators of the time noted that the V8-engined Silver Cloud II was neither as quiet nor as smooth as the straight-six-cylinder-engined Silver Cloud I, despite the new engine&#x27;s hydraulic tappet operation. The new wet-linered V8 was also a little cramped in an engine bay intended originally for a narrower unit: in order to change the spark plugs it was necessary to remove the front wheel on the car&#x27;s right side. There seems to have been a problem with crankshaft breakages in the earlier V8s: this was blamed on lack of lubrication to the bearings.

The basic architecture of the Silver Cloud II did not change between 1959 and 1963, but there were numerous minor changes implemented, notable among them a succession of improvements to the ventilation system. Interior changes in 1961 included the adoption of blue instrument lighting, the introduction of a combined indicator / headlamp flasher switch and of a handbrake warning light. A remodelled rear light assembly was introduced in May 1962 and a change to single sealed-beam headlamps was made in August 1962.

The &quot;Motor&quot; magazine tested a Series II in 1960. They recorded a top speed of , acceleration from 0- in 10.9 seconds and a fuel consumption of . The test car cost £6092 including taxes.


===Silver Cloud III===

The Silver Cloud III was first displayed to the public at the Paris salon at the beginning of October 1962 but along with the Bentley S3 the cars were displayed on a specialist coachwork stand as if the modifications were to the special order of a particular customer. External dimensions were slightly altered, the interior remodelled, the weight reduced by a little over and improvements made to the engine which included fitting SU carburettors in place of the inch units used on the Series II Silver Cloud. 

The compression ratio was increased to 9:1, reflecting the higher octane levels of premium fuel in major markets, although the option of a lower 8:1 compression ratio was still offered in markets where non-availability of higher octane fuels might be an issue. Rolls-Royce, as before, refused to disclose overall engine power output, but indicated that there had been an improvement of &quot;perhaps 7%&quot;. Increased power and weight reduction boosted speed and performance slightly. The engine now included a nitride hardened crankshaft to reflect the extra power being generated and in response to reports of broken crankshafts in the earlier V8 Silver Clouds. The transmission was a GM Hydramatic which Rolls-Royce used under licence.

The headlights were grouped in a four-headlamp layout subsequently continued in the later Silver Shadow. Other external changes included a slightly increased slope of the bonnet to correspond with a reduction in radiator grille height.

Between 1963 and 1966 there were no major changes. Stainless steel wheel trims replaced chrome-plated ones in April 1963, and an improved rear window demister was introduced in November of the same year. Wider front seats were fitted in January 1964, and five months later a revised headlamp surround now incorporated a very small RR monogram. A chrome badge reading &quot;Silver Cloud III&quot; in an italic font can be seen on the right bottom side of the boot of most UK and European delivered examples, whilst US versions were delivered without this badge.

As with earlier models, Rolls-Royce continued to make the Silver Cloud chassis available to traditional coachbuilders. A notable version is the Fixed Head and Drop Head Coupe styled by Mulliner Park Ward, having unusual slanted headlights, also found on contemporary Italian designed or Italian-influenced high performance cars from Lancia, Triumph, Lagonda and Gordon-Keeble. It was derived from the earlier Park Ward design for the Bentley S1 and S2 Continentals, made also available for the S3. Some 100 of the 328 coach-built Silver Cloud IIIs were of this style.

This is a large, functionally diverse protein family belonging to the AAA+ protein superfamily of ring-shaped P-loop NTPases, which exert their activity through the energy-dependent remodeling or translocation of macromolecules.

AAA proteins couple chemical energy provided by ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes which are transduced into mechanical force exerted on a macromolecular substrate.

AAA proteins are functionally and organizationally diverse, and vary in activity, stability, and mechanism. Members of the AAA family are found in all organisms and they are essential for many cellular functions. They are involved in processes such as DNA replication, protein degradation, membrane fusion, microtubule severing, peroxisome biogenesis, signal transduction and the regulation of gene expression.

== Structure==
The AAA proteins contain two domains, an N-terminal alpha/beta domain that binds and hydrolyzes nucleotides (a Rossmann fold) and a C-terminal alpha-helical domain. The N-terminal domain is 200-250 amino acids long and contains Walker A and Walker B motifs, and is shared in common with other P-loop NTPases, the superfamily which includes the AAA family. Most AAA proteins have additional domains that are used for oligomerization, substrate binding and/or regulation. These domains can lie N- or C-terminal to the AAA module.

=== Classification ===
Some classes of AAA proteins have an N-terminal non-ATPase domain which is followed by either one or two AAA domains (D1 and D2). In some proteins with two AAA domains, both are evolutionarily well conserved (like in Cdc48/p97). In others, either the D2 domain (like in Pex1p and Pex6p) or the D1 domain (in Sec18p/NSF) is better conserved in evolution.

While the classical AAA family was based on motifs, the family has been expanded using structural information and is now termed the AAA family.

=== Evolutionary relationships ===
AAA proteins are divided into seven basic clades, based on secondary structure elements included within or near the core AAA fold: clamp loader, initiator, classic, superfamily III helicase, HCLR, H2-insert, and PS-II insert.

== Quaternary structure ==

AAA ATPases assemble into oligomeric assemblies (often homo-hexamers) that form a ring-shaped structure with a central pore. These proteins produce a molecular motor that couples ATP binding and hydrolysis to changes in conformational states that can be propagated through the assembly in order to act upon a target substrate, either translocating or remodelling the substrate.

The central pore may be involved in substrate processing. In the hexameric configuration, the ATP-binding site is positioned at the interface between the subunits. Upon ATP binding and hydrolysis, AAA enzymes undergo conformational changes in the AAA-domains as well as in the N-domains. These motions can be transmitted to substrate protein.

== Molecular mechanism ==

ATP hydrolysis by AAA ATPases is proposed to involve nucleophilic attack on the ATP gamma-phosphate by an activated water molecule, leading to movement of the N-terminal and C-terminal AAA subdomains relative to each other. This movement allows the exertion of mechanical force, amplified by other ATPase domains within the same oligomeric structure. The additional domains in the protein allow for regulation or direction of the force towards different goals.

== Prokaryotic AAAs ==

AAA proteins are not restricted to eukaryotes. Prokaryotes have AAA which combine chaperone with proteolytic activity, for example in ClpAPS complex, which mediates protein degradation and recognition in &quot;E. coli&quot;. The basic recognition of proteins by AAAs is thought to occur through unfolded protein domains in the substrate protein. In HslU, a bacterial ClpX/ClpY homologue of the HSP100 family of AAA proteins, the N- and C-terminal subdomains move towards each other when nucleotides are bound and hydrolysed. The terminal domains are most distant in the nucleotide-free state and closest in the ADP-bound state. Thereby the opening of the central cavity is affected.

== Functions ==
AAA proteins are involved in protein degradation, membrane fusion, DNA replication, microtubule dynamics, intracellular transport, transcriptional activation, protein refolding, disassembly of protein complexes and protein aggregates.

=== Molecular motion ===

Dyneins, one of the three major classes of motor protein, are AAA proteins which couple their ATPase activity to molecular motion along microtubules.

The AAA-type ATPase Cdc48p/p97 is perhaps the best-studied AAA protein. Misfolded secretory proteins are exported from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and degraded by the ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD). Nonfunctional membrane and luminal proteins are extracted from the ER and degraded in the cytosol by proteasomes. Substrate retrotranslocation and extraction is assisted by the Cdc48p(Ufd1p/Npl4p) complex on the cytosolic side of the membrane. On the cytosolic side, the substrate is ubiquitinated by ER-based E2 and E3 enzymes before degradation by the 26S proteasome.

=== Targeting to multivesicular bodies ===

Multivesicular bodies are endosomal compartments that sort ubiquitinated membrane proteins by incorporating them into vesicles. This process involves the sequential action of three multiprotein complexes, ESCRT I to III (ESCRT standing for &#x27;endosomal sorting complexes required for transport&#x27;). Vps4p is a AAA-type ATPase involved in this MVB sorting pathway. It had originally been identified as a ”class E” vps (vacuolar protein sorting) mutant and was subsequently shown to catalyse the dissociation of ESCRT complexes. Vps4p is anchored via Vps46p to the endosomal membrane. Vps4p assembly is assisted by the conserved Vta1p protein, which regulates its oligomerization status and ATPase activity.

=== Proteasome functions ===

AAA proteases use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to translocate a protein inside the proteasome for degradation. Cdc48p/p97 functions as a hexameric AAA+ ATPase that provides the mechanical force necessary for substrate dislocation. Its activity is tightly regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis, which induce conformational changes required for protein unfolding and extraction. The HbYX motif plays a crucial role in regulating this process by mediating interactions between Cdc48p/p97 and downstream effectors such as the 20S proteasome or specific cofactors (e.g., Ufd1/Npl4). This interaction facilitates substrate transfer from Cdc48p/p97 to the proteasome, ensuring efficient protein degradation.

Given its pivotal role in protein homeostasis, Cdc48p/p97 has been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes beyond ERAD, including autophagy, mitochondrial quality control, and DNA repair. The dysregulation of its function, particularly through mutations affecting the ATPase domain or HbYX-mediated interactions, has been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.

<text>William Allen Henderson (born November 6, 1944) is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and music producer. Henderson is best known for his work as lead singer and guitarist with the group Chilliwack in the 1970s and 1980s,

==Career==
As a young man, Henderson performed as a guitarist in the Panorama Trio at the Vancouver Hilton Hotel&#x27;s Panorama Roof restaurant. He then helped form the psychedelic rock group The Collectors.

After The Collectors disbanded, Henderson and other former Collectors formed the band Chilliwack. The group played together for more than 30 years, and produced the hits &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;, &quot;California Girl&quot;, and &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)&quot;. He is also part of the folk music supergroup UHF.

As well as performing, Henderson has produced many recordings; he won the 1983 Juno Award for &quot;Producer of the Year&quot;, with Brian MacLeod, for Chilliwack&#x27;s &quot;Opus X&quot; album. He also won a Genie Award for best original song in a movie (&quot;When I Sing&quot;, from &quot;Bye Bye Blues&quot;), and was musical director for the Canadian edition of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1989 to 1995. Henderson was a founding inductee to the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame in 1994.

Henderson has served as director of the Canadian Association of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) and as president of the Songwriters Association of Canada. In 2014 he was awarded the Special Achievement Award by SOCAN at the 2014 SOCAN Awards in Toronto.

Henderson was named a Member of the Order of Canada in 2015.

In 2016, Henderson continues to tour Canada as a solo musician and to perform with Chilliwack.

==Personal==
Henderson&#x27;s daughter Camille Henderson is a singer; she was a member in the early 1990s of the pop trio West End Girls, and has appeared as a guest vocalist on albums by Sarah McLachlan and Delerium. Another daughter, Saffron Henderson is a singer and voice actress.

<text>The 2004 OFC Nations Cup was the edition of the tournament for the OFC Nations Cup and doubled as the qualification tournament to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, except the two-legged final. A separate playoff between Australia and Solomon Islands was held in September 2005, for World Cup Qualifying purposes.

The competition was divided in two Group stages (the first is the Qualifying Stage), with Australia and New Zealand seeded into the second stage (Final Stage). The Oceania champion (Australia) qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.

==Qualification==

The 10 teams in the first round were divided into two sections of five teams each. Each team played every other team once. The top two teams from each group then progressed to the second group stage, where they were joined by the two seeded teams.

==Final tournament==
The four surviving members (first and second place teams from each group in stage one) of the first stage joined the two seeded teams (Australia and New Zealand) and took part in a tournament where each team played every other once in a tournament held in Adelaide, Australia.

As this doubled as the 2004 Oceania Nations Cup, the top two teams from the second group stage progressed to a two-legged final to determine the winner of the OFC Nations Cup. These two games on home-and-away basis was separate from World Cup qualifying.

The top two teams from this stage also progressed to the final stage of the 2006 Oceania World Cup qualifying tournament.

==Final==

The final of the 2004 Oceania Nations Cup was a two-legged home and away final between the top two teams from the second group stage.




Australia won 11–1 on aggregate and became the 2004 Oceania Nations Cup Champions. They also qualified for the 2005 Confederations Cup.

Although the second round of 2004 OFC Nations Cup doubled the second round of 2006 FIFA World Cup Oceanian qualification, the final play-off for the World Cup was held separately. Australia defeated Solomon Islands again, winning 9–1 on aggregate, and advanced to a play-off against the CONMEBOL (South American) nation Uruguay.

<doc id="1091918" wikidata="Q131006" url="?curid=1091918" title="Baryonyx">
<text>Baryonyx () is a genus of theropod dinosaur which lived in the Barremian stage of the Early Cretaceous period, about 130–125 million years ago. The first skeleton was discovered in 1983 in the Smokejack Clay Pit, of Surrey, England, in sediments of the Weald Clay Formation, and became the holotype specimen of Baryonyx walkeri, named by palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner in 1986. The generic name, &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, means &quot;heavy claw&quot; and alludes to the animal&#x27;s very large claw on the first finger; the specific name, &quot;walkeri&quot;, refers to its discoverer, amateur fossil collector William J. Walker. The holotype specimen is one of the most complete theropod skeletons from the UK (and remains the most complete spinosaurid), and its discovery attracted media attention. Specimens later discovered in other parts of the United Kingdom and Iberia have also been assigned to the genus, though many have since been moved to new genera.

The holotype specimen, which may not have been fully grown, was estimated to have been between long and to have weighed between . &quot;Baryonyx&quot; had a long, low, and narrow snout, which has been compared to that of a gharial. The tip of the snout expanded to the sides in the shape of a rosette. Behind this, the upper jaw had a notch which fitted into the lower jaw (which curved upwards in the same area). It had a triangular crest on the top of its nasal bones. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; had a large number of finely serrated, conical teeth, with the largest teeth in front. The neck formed an S-shape, and the neural spines of its dorsal vertebrae increased in height from front to back. One elongated neural spine indicates it may have had a hump or ridge along the centre of its back. It had robust forelimbs, with the eponymous first-finger claw measuring about long.

Now recognised as a member of the family Spinosauridae, &quot;Baryonyx&quot; affinities were obscure when it was discovered. Some researchers have suggested that &quot;Suchosaurus cultridens&quot; is a senior synonym (being an older name), and that &quot;Suchomimus tenerensis&quot; belongs in the same genus; subsequent authors have kept them separate. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was the first theropod dinosaur demonstrated to have been piscivorous (fish-eating), as evidenced by fish scales in the stomach region of the holotype specimen. It may also have been an active predator of larger prey and a scavenger, since it also contained bones of a juvenile iguanodontid. The creature would have caught and processed its prey primarily with its forelimbs and large claws. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; may have had semi-aquatic habits, and coexisted with other theropod, ornithopod, and sauropod dinosaurs, as well as pterosaurs, crocodiles, turtles and fishes, in a fluvial environment.

==History of discovery==
In January 1983, the plumber and amateur fossil collector William J. Walker explored the Smokejack Clay Pit, a clay pit in the Weald Clay Formation near Ockley in Surrey, England. He found a rock wherein he discovered a large claw, but after piecing it together at home, he realised the tip of the claw was missing. Walker returned to the same spot in the pit some weeks later, and found the missing part after searching for an hour. He also found a and part of a . Walker&#x27;s son-in-law later brought the claw to the Natural History Museum of London, where it was examined by the palaeontologists Alan J. Charig and Angela C. Milner, who identified it as belonging to a theropod dinosaur. The palaeontologists found more bone fragments at the site in February, but the entire skeleton could not be collected until May and June due to weather conditions at the pit. A team of eight museum staff members and several volunteers excavated of rock matrix in 54 blocks over a three-week period. Walker donated the claw to the museum, and the Ockley Brick Company (owners of the pit) donated the rest of the skeleton and provided equipment. The area had been explored for 200 years, but no similar remains had been found before.

Most of the bones collected were encased in siltstone nodules surrounded by fine sand and silt, with the rest lying in clay. The bones were and scattered over a area, but most were not far from their natural positions. The position of some bones was disturbed by a bulldozer, and some were broken by mechanical equipment before they were collected. Preparing the specimen was difficult, due to the hardness of the siltstone matrix and the presence of siderite; acid preparation was attempted, but most of the matrix was removed mechanically. It took six years of almost constant preparation to get all the bones out of the rock, and by the end, dental tools and air mallets had to be used under a microscope. The specimen represents about 65 per cent of the skeleton, and consists of partial skull bones, including premaxillae (first bones of the upper jaw); the left maxillae (second bone of the upper jaw); both nasal bones; the left lacrimal; the left prefrontal; the left postorbital; the braincase including the occiput; both dentaries (the front bones of the lower jaw); various bones from the back of the lower jaw; teeth; cervical (neck), dorsal (back), and caudal (tail) ; ribs; a ; both (shoulder blades); both ; both (upper arm bones); the left and (lower arm bones); finger bones and (claw bones); hip bones; the upper end of the left (thigh bone) and lower end of the right; right (of the lower leg); and foot bones including an ungual. The original specimen number was BMNH R9951, but it was later re-catalogued as NHMUK PV R9951.

In 1986, Charig and Milner named a new genus and species with the skeleton as holotype specimen: &quot;Baryonyx walkeri&quot;. The generic name derives from ancient Greek; βαρύς (&quot;barys&quot;) means &quot;heavy&quot; or &quot;strong&quot;, and ὄνυξ (&quot;onyx&quot;) means &quot;claw&quot; or &quot;talon&quot;. The specific name honours Walker, for discovering the specimen. At that time, the authors did not know if the large claw belonged to the hand or the foot (as in dromaeosaurs, which it was then assumed to be). The dinosaur had been presented earlier the same year during a lecture at a conference about dinosaur systematics in Drumheller, Canada. Due to ongoing work on the bones (70 per cent had been prepared at the time), they called their article preliminary and promised a more detailed description at a later date. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was the first large Early Cretaceous theropod found anywhere in the world by that time. Before the discovery of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; the last significant theropod find in the United Kingdom was &quot;Eustreptospondylus&quot; in 1871, and in a 1986 interview Charig called &quot;Baryonyx&quot; &quot;the best find of the century&quot; in Europe. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was widely featured in international media, and was nicknamed &quot;Claws&quot; by journalists punning on the title of the film &quot;Jaws&quot;. Its discovery was the subject of a 1987 BBC documentary, and a cast of the skeleton is mounted at the Natural History Museum in London. In 1997, Charig and Milner published a monograph describing the holotype skeleton in detail. The holotype specimen remains the most completely known spinosaurid skeleton.

===Assigned specimens===
Fossils from other parts of the UK and Iberia, mostly isolated teeth, have subsequently been attributed to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; or similar animals. Isolated teeth and bones from the Isle of Wight, including hand bones reported in 1998 and a vertebra reported by the palaeontologists Steve Hutt and Penny Newbery in 2004, have been attributed to this genus. A maxilla fragment from La Rioja, Spain, was attributed to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; by the palaeontologists Luis I. Viera and José Angel Torres in 1995 (although the palaeontologist Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues raised the possibility that it could have belonged to &quot;Suchomimus&quot; in 2004). In 1999, a postorbital, , tooth, vertebral remains, (hand bones), and a phalanx from the Salas de los Infantes deposit in Burgos Province, Spain, were attributed to an immature &quot;Baryonyx&quot; (though some of these elements are unknown in the holotype) by the palaeontologist Carolina Fuentes Vidarte and colleagues. Dinosaur tracks near Burgos have also been suggested to belong to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; or a similar theropod.
In 2011, a specimen (Catalogued as ML1190 in Museu da Lourinhã) from the Papo Seco Formation in Boca do Chapim, Portugal, with a fragmentary dentary, teeth, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, a scapula, and a phalanx bone, was attributed to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; by the palaeontologist Octávio Mateus and colleagues, the most complete Iberian remains of the animal. The skeletal elements of this specimen are also represented in the more complete holotype (which was of similar size), except for the mid-neck vertebrae. In 2018, the palaeontologist Thomas M. S. Arden and colleagues found that the Portuguese skeleton did not belong to &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, since the front of its dentary bone was not strongly upturned. This specimen was made the basis of the new genus &quot;Iberospinus&quot; by Mateus and Darío Estraviz-López in 2022. Multiple studies found that additional spinosaurid remains from Iberia may belong to taxa other than &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, such as &quot;Vallibonavenatrix&quot; and &quot;Protathlitis&quot;, or may be indeterminate. A 2024 article by the palaeontologist Erik Isasmendi and colleagues reviewed the spinosaurid fossil record of Iberia and concluded that no specimens from there could be assigned to &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. They moved a specimen formerly assigned to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; from La Rioja to the new genus &quot;Riojavenatrix&quot;.

In 2021, the palaeontologist Chris T. Barker and colleagues described two new spinosaurid genera from the Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight, &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot; and &quot;Riparovenator&quot; (the latter named &quot;R. milnerae&quot; honouring Milner for her contributions to spinosaurid research), and stated that spinosaurid material from there that had previously been attributed to the contemporary &quot;Baryonyx&quot; could have belonged to other taxa instead. These specimens had previously been assigned to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; in a 2017 conference abstract. Barker and colleagues stated that the recognition of the Wessex Formation specimens as new genera renders the presence of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; there ambiguous, and most of the previously assigned isolated material from the Wealden Supergroup is therefore indeterminate. A 2023 study of an isolated tooth by Barker and colleagues found that it and other teeth from the Wealden Supergroup that have previously been assigned to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; probably do not belong to the genus, based on their morphology and age.

===Possible synonyms===

In 2003, Milner noted that some teeth at the Natural History Museum previously identified as belonging to the genera &quot;Suchosaurus&quot; (the first named spinosaurid) and &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; probably belonged to &quot;Baryonyx&quot;. The type species of &quot;Suchosaurus&quot;, &quot;S. cultridens&quot;, was named by the biologist Richard Owen in 1841, based on teeth discovered by the geologist Gideon A. Mantell in Tilgate Forest, Sussex. Owen originally thought the teeth to have belonged to a crocodile; he was yet to name the group Dinosauria, which happened the following year. A second species, &quot;S. girardi&quot;, was named by the palaeontologist Henri Émile Sauvage in 1897, based on jaw fragments and a tooth from Boca do Chapim, Portugal. In 2007, the palaeontologist Éric Buffetaut considered the teeth of &quot;S. girardi&quot; very similar to those of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; (and &quot;S. cultridens&quot;) except for the stronger development of the flutes (or &quot;ribs&quot;; lengthwise ridges), suggesting that the remains belonged to the same genus. Buffetaut agreed with Milner that the teeth of &quot;S. cultridens&quot; were almost identical to those of &quot;B. walkeri&quot;, but with a ribbier surface. The former taxon might be a senior synonym of the latter (since it was published first), depending on whether the differences were within a taxon or between different ones. According to Buffetaut, since the holotype specimen of &quot;S. cultridens&quot; is a single tooth and that of &quot;B. walkeri&quot; is a skeleton, it would be more practical to retain the newer name. In 2011, Mateus and colleagues agreed that &quot;Suchosaurus&quot; was closely related to &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, but considered both species in the former genus &quot;nomina dubia&quot; (dubious names) since their holotype specimens were not considered diagnostic (lacking distinguishing features) and could not be definitely equated with other taxa. Barker and colleagues agreed with this in 2023.
In 1997, Charig and Milner noted that two fragmentary spinosaurid snouts from the Elrhaz Formation of Niger (reported by the palaeontologist Philippe Taquet in 1984) were similar enough to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; that they considered them to belong to an indeterminate species of the genus (despite their much younger Aptian geological age). In 1998, these fossils became the basis of the genus and species &quot;Cristatusaurus lapparenti&quot;, named by Taquet and the palaeontologist Dale Russell. The palaeontologist Paul Sereno and colleagues named the new genus and species &quot;Suchomimus tenerensis&quot; later in 1998, based on more complete fossils from the Elrhaz Formation. In 2002, the German palaeontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and colleagues proposed that &quot;Suchomimus tenerensis&quot; was similar enough to &quot;Baryonyx walkeri&quot; to be considered a species within the same genus (as &quot;B. tenerensis&quot;), and that &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was identical to &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot;. Milner concurred that the material from Niger was indistinguishable from &quot;Baryonyx&quot; in 2003. In a 2004 conference abstract, Hutt and Newberry supported the synonymy based on a large theropod vertebra from the Isle of Wight which they attributed to an animal closely related to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot;. Later studies have kept &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot; separate, whereas &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot; has been proposed to be either a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; or possibly distinct from both. A 2017 review paper by the palaeontologist Carlos Roberto A. Candeiro and colleagues stated that this debate was more in the realm of semantics than science, as it is generally agreed that &quot;B. walkeri&quot; and &quot;S. tenerensis&quot; are distinct, related species. Barker and colleagues found &quot;Suchomimus&quot; to be closer related to the British genera &quot;Riparovenator&quot; and &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot; than to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; in 2021.

==Description==
&quot;Baryonyx&quot; is estimated to have been between long, in hip height, and to have weighed between . The fact that elements of the skull and vertebral column of the &quot;B. walkeri&quot; holotype specimen (NHM R9951) do not appear to have co-ossified (fused) suggests that the individual was not fully grown, and the mature animal may have been much larger (as is the case for some other spinosaurids). On the other hand, the specimen&#x27;s fused sternum indicates that it may have been mature.

===Skull===

The skull of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; is incompletely known, and much of the middle and hind portions are not preserved. The full length of the skull is estimated to have been long, based on comparison with that of the related genus &quot;Suchomimus&quot; (which was 20% larger). It was elongated, and the front of the premaxillae formed a long, narrow, and low snout (rostrum) with a smoothly rounded upper surface. The (bony nostrils) were long, low, and placed far back from the snout tip. The front of the snout expanded into a spatulate (spoon-like), &quot;terminal rosette&quot;, a shape similar to the rostrum of the modern gharial. The front of the lower margin of the premaxillae was downturned (or hooked), whereas that of the front portion of the maxillae was upturned. This morphology resulted in a sigmoid or S-shaped margin of the lower upper tooth row, in which the teeth from the front of the maxilla were projecting forward. The snout was particularly narrow directly behind the rosette; this area received the large teeth of the mandible. The maxilla and premaxilla of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; fit together in a complex articulation, and the resulting gap between the upper and lower jaw is known as the . A downturned premaxilla and a sigmoid lower margin of the upper tooth row was also present in distantly related theropods such as &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. The snout had extensive (openings), which would have been exits for blood vessels and nerves, and the maxilla appears to have housed sinuses.
&quot;Baryonyx&quot; had a rudimentary , similar to crocodiles but unlike most theropod dinosaurs. A rugose (roughly wrinkled) surface suggests the presence of a horny pad in the roof of the mouth. The nasal bones were fused, which distinguished &quot;Baryonyx&quot; from other spinosaurids, and a sagittal crest was present above the eyes, on the upper mid-line of the nasals. This crest was triangular, narrow, and sharp in its front part, and was distinct from those of other spinosaurids in ending hind wards in a cross-shaped process. The lacrimal bone in front of the eye appears to have formed a horn core similar to those seen, for example, in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, and was distinct from other spinosaurids in being solid and almost triangular. The occiput was narrow, with the paroccipital processes pointing outwards horizontally, and the were lengthened, descending far below the (the lowermost bone of the occiput). Sereno and colleagues suggested that some of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; cranial bones had been misidentified by Charig and Milner, resulting in the occiput being reconstructed as too deep, and that the skull was instead probably as low, long and narrow as that of &quot;Suchomimus&quot;. The front of the dentary in the mandible sloped upwards towards the curve of the snout. The dentary was very long and shallow, with a prominent Meckelian groove on the inner side. The , where the two halves of the lower jaw connected at the front, was particularly short. The rest of the lower jaw was fragile; the hind third was much thinner than the front, with a blade-like appearance. The front part of the dentary curved outwards to accommodate the large front teeth, and this area formed the mandibular part of the rosette. The dentary–like the snout—had many foramina.
Most of the teeth found with the holotype specimen were not in articulation with the skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were still borne by the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, where slightly flattened from sideways, and their curvature was almost uniform. The roots were very long, and tapered towards their extremity. The carinae (sharp front and back edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles on the front and back, and extended all along the crown. There were around six to eight denticles per mm (0.039 in), a much larger number than in large-bodied theropods like &quot;Torvosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained (outermost layer of teeth), while others bore no flutes; their presence is probably related to position or ontogeny (development during growth). The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large compared to most other theropods, with six to seven teeth in each premaxilla and thirty-two in each dentary. Based on the closer packing and smaller size of the dentary teeth compared to those in the corresponding length of the premaxilla, the difference between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws appears to have been more pronounced than in other theropods. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw of the holotype had thirteen (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side, showing tooth count asymmetry. The first four upper teeth were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Small subtriangular were present between the alveoli.

===Postcranial skeleton===

Initially thought to have lacked the sigmoid curve typical of theropods, the neck of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; does appear to have formed an S shape, though straighter than in other theropods. The cervical vertebrae of the neck tapered towards the head and became progressively longer front to back. Their (the processes that connected the vertebrae) were flat, and their (processes to which neck muscles attached) were well developed. The (the second neck vertebra) was small relative to the size of the skull and had a well-developed . The of the cervical vertebrae were not always sutured to the (the bodies of the vertebrae), and the there were low and thin. The were short, similar to those of crocodiles, and possibly overlapped each other somewhat. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae of the back were similar in size. Like in other theropods, the skeleton of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; showed skeletal pneumaticity, reducing its weight through (openings) in the neural arches and (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the ). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal vertebrae changed from short and stout to tall and broad. One isolated dorsal neural spine was moderately elongated and slender, indicating that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; may have had a hump or ridge along the centre of its back (though incipiently developed compared to those of other spinosaurids). &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was unique among spinosaurids in having a marked constriction from side to side in a vertebra that either belonged to the or front of the tail.
The coracoid tapered hind-wards when viewed in profile, and, uniquely among spinosaurids, connected with the scapula in a peg-and-notch articulation. The scapulae were robust and the bones of the forelimb were short in relation to the animal&#x27;s size, but broad and sturdy. The humerus was short and stout, with its ends broadly expanded and flattened—the upper side for the and muscle attachment and the lower for articulation with the radius and ulna. The radius was short, stout and straight, and less than half the length of the humerus, while the ulna was a little longer. The ulna had a powerful and an expanded lower end. The hands had three fingers; the first finger bore a large claw measuring about along its curve in the holotype specimen. The claw would have been lengthened by a keratin (horny) sheath in life. Apart from its size, the claw&#x27;s proportions were fairly typical of a theropod, i.e. it was bilaterally symmetric, slightly compressed, smoothly rounded, and sharply pointed. A groove for the sheath ran along the length of the claw. The other claws of the hand were much smaller. The (main hip bone) of the pelvis had a prominent , an anterior process that was slender and vertically expanded, and a posterior process that was long and straight. The ilium also had a prominent and a deep grove that faced downwards. The (the socket for the femur) was long from front to back. The (lower and rearmost hip bone) had a well developed at the upper part. The margin of the blade at the lower end was turned outward, and the pubic foot was not expanded. The femur lacked a groove on the fibular condyle, and, uniquely among spinosaurids, the fibula had a very shallow fibular (depression).

==Classification==
In their original description, Charig and Milner found &quot;Baryonyx&quot; unique enough to warrant a new family of theropod dinosaurs: Baryonychidae. They found &quot;Baryonyx&quot; to be unlike any other theropod group, and considered the possibility that it was a thecodont (a grouping of early archosaurs now considered unnatural), due to having apparently primitive features, but noted that the articulation of the maxilla and premaxilla was similar to that in &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;. They also noted that the two snouts from Niger (which later became the basis of &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot;), assigned to the family Spinosauridae by Taquet in 1984, appeared almost identical to that of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and they referred them to Baryonychidae instead. In 1988, the palaeontologist Gregory S. Paul agreed with Taquet that &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, described in 1915 based on fragmentary remains from Egypt that were destroyed in World War II, and &quot;Baryonyx&quot; were similar and (due to their kinked snouts) possibly late-surviving dilophosaurs. Buffetaut also supported this relationship in 1989. In 1990, Charig and Milner dismissed the spinosaurid affinities of &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, since they did not find their remains similar enough. In 1997, they agreed that Baryonychidae and Spinosauridae were related, but disagreed that the former name should become a synonym of the latter, because the completeness of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; compared to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; made it a better type genus for a family, and because they did not find the similarities between the two significant enough. Holtz and colleagues listed Baryonychidae as a synonym of Spinosauridae in 2004.

Discoveries in the 1990s shed more light on the relationships of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and its relatives. In 1996, a snout from Morocco was referred to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and &quot;Irritator&quot; and &quot;Angaturama&quot; from Brazil (the two are possible synonyms) were named. &quot;Cristatusaurus&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot; were named based on fossils from Niger in 1998. In their description of &quot;Suchomimus&quot;, Sereno and colleagues placed it and &quot;Baryonyx&quot; in the new subfamily Baryonychinae within Spinosauridae; &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Irritator&quot; were placed in the subfamily Spinosaurinae. Baryonychinae was distinguished by the small size and larger number of teeth in the dentary behind the terminal rosette, the deeply keeled front dorsal vertebrae, and by having serrated teeth. Spinosaurinae was distinguished by their straight tooth crowns without serrations, small first tooth in the premaxilla, increased spacing of teeth in the jaws, and possibly by having their nostrils placed further back and the presence of a deep neural spine sail. They also united the spinosaurids and their closest relatives in the superfamily Spinosauroidea, but in 2010, the palaeontologist Roger Benson considered this a junior synonym of Megalosauroidea (an older name). In a 2007 conference abstract, the palaeontologist Denver W. Fowler suggested that since &quot;Suchosaurus&quot; is the first named genus in its group, the clade names Spinosauroidea, Spinosauridae, and Baryonychinae should be replaced by Suchosauroidea, Suchosauridae, and Suchosaurinae, regardless of whether or not the name &quot;Baryonyx&quot; is retained. A 2017 study by the palaeontologists Marcos A. F. Sales and Cesar L. Schultz found that the clade Baryonychinae was not well supported, since serrated teeth may be an ancestral trait among spinosaurids.

Barker and colleagues found support for a Baryonychinae-Spinosaurinae split in 2021, and the following cladogram shows the position of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; within Spinosauridae according to their study:

===Evolution===

Spinosaurids appear to have been widespread from the Barremian to the Cenomanian stages of the Cretaceous period, about 130 to 95 million years ago, while the oldest known spinosaurid remains date to the Middle Jurassic. They shared features such as long, narrow, crocodile-like skulls; sub-circular teeth, with fine to no serrations; the terminal rosette of the snout; and a secondary palate that made them more resistant to torsion. In contrast, the primitive and typical condition for theropods was a tall, narrow snout with blade-like (ziphodont) teeth with serrated carinae. The skull adaptations of spinosaurids converged with those of crocodilians; early members of the latter group had skulls similar to typical theropods, later developing elongated snouts, conical teeth, and secondary palates. These adaptations may have been the result of a dietary change from terrestrial prey to fish. Unlike crocodiles, the post-cranial skeletons of baryonychine spinosaurids do not appear to have aquatic adaptations. Sereno and colleagues proposed in 1998 that the large thumb-claw and robust forelimbs of spinosaurids evolved in the Middle Jurassic, before the elongation of the skull and other adaptations related to fish-eating, since the former features are shared with their megalosaurid relatives. They also suggested that the spinosaurines and baryonychines diverged before the Barremian age of the Early Cretaceous.

Several theories have been proposed about the biogeography of the spinosaurids. Since &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was more closely related to &quot;Baryonyx&quot; (from Europe) than to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;—although that genus also lived in Africa—the distribution of spinosaurids cannot be explained as vicariance resulting from continental rifting. Sereno and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were initially distributed across the supercontinent Pangea, but split with the opening of the Tethys Sea. Spinosaurines would then have evolved in the south (Africa and South America: in Gondwana) and baryonychines in the north (Europe: in Laurasia), with &quot;Suchomimus&quot; the result of a single north-to-south dispersal event. Buffetaut and the Tunisian palaeontologist Mohamed Ouaja also suggested in 2002 that baryonychines could be the ancestors of spinosaurines, which appear to have replaced the former in Africa. Milner suggested in 2003 that spinosaurids originated in Laurasia during the Jurassic, and dispersed via the Iberian land bridge into Gondwana, where they radiated. In 2007, Buffetaut pointed out that palaeogeographical studies had demonstrated that Iberia was near northern Africa during the Early Cretaceous, which he found to confirm Milner&#x27;s idea that the Iberian region was a stepping stone between Europe and Africa, which is supported by the presence of baryonychines in Iberia. The direction of the dispersal between Europe and Africa is still unknown, and subsequent discoveries of spinosaurid remains in Asia and possibly Australia indicate that it may have been complex.

Candeiro and colleagues suggested in 2017 that spinosaurids of northern Gondwana were replaced by other predators, such as abelisauroids, since no definite spinosaurid fossils are known from after the Cenomanian anywhere in the world. They attributed the disappearance of spinosaurids and other shifts in the fauna of Gondwana to changes in the environment, perhaps caused by transgressions in sea level. Malafaia and colleagues stated in 2020 that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; remains the oldest unquestionable spinosaurid, while acknowledging that older remains had also been tentatively assigned to the group. Barker and colleagues found support for a European origin for spinosaurids in 2021, with an expansion to Asia and Gondwana during the first half of the Early Cretaceous. In contrast to Sereno, these authors suggested there had been at least two dispersal events from Europe to Africa, leading to &quot;Suchomimus&quot; and the African part of Spinosaurinae.

==Palaeobiology==
===Diet and feeding===
In 1986, Charig and Milner suggested that its elongated snout with many finely serrated teeth indicated that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was piscivorous (fish-eating), speculating that it crouched on a riverbank and used its claw to gaff fish out of the water (similar to the modern grizzly bear). Two years earlier, Taquet pointed out that the spinosaurid snouts from Niger were similar to those of the modern gharial and suggested a behaviour similar to herons or storks. In 1987, the biologist Andrew Kitchener disputed the piscivorous behaviour of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and suggested that it would have been a scavenger, using its long neck to feed on the ground, its claws to break into a carcass, and its long snout (with nostrils far back for breathing) for investigating the body cavity. Kitchener argued that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; jaws and teeth were too weak to kill other dinosaurs and too heavy to catch fish, with too many adaptations for piscivory. According to the palaeontologist Robin E. H. Reid, a scavenged carcass would have been broken up by its predator and large animals capable of doing so—such as grizzly bears—are also capable of catching fish (at least in shallow water).

In 1997, Charig and Milner demonstrated direct dietary evidence in the stomach region of the &quot;B. walkeri&quot; holotype. It contained the first evidence of piscivory in a theropod dinosaur, acid-etched scales and teeth of the common fish &quot;Scheenstia mantelli&quot; (then classified in the genus &quot;Lepidotes&quot;), and abraded or etched bones of a young iguanodontid. They also presented circumstantial evidence for piscivory, such as crocodile-like adaptations for catching and swallowing prey: long, narrow jaws with their &quot;terminal rosette&quot;, similar to those of a gharial, and the downturned tip and notch of the snout. In their view, these adaptations suggested that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; would have caught small to medium-sized fish in the manner of a crocodilian: gripping them with the notch of the snout (giving the teeth a &quot;stabbing function&quot;), tilting the head backwards, and swallowing them headfirst. Larger fish would be broken up with the claws. That the teeth in the lower jaw were smaller, more crowded and numerous than those in the upper jaw may have helped the animal grip food. Charig and Milner maintained that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; would primarily have eaten fish (although it would also have been an active predator and opportunistic scavenger), but it was not equipped to be a macro-predator like &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. They suggested that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; mainly used its forelimbs and large claws to catch, kill and tear apart larger prey. An apparent gastrolith (gizzard stone) was also found with the specimen. The German palaeontologist Oliver Wings suggested in 2007 that the low number of stones found in theropods like &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; could have been ingested by accident. In 2004, a pterosaur neck vertebra from Brazil with a spinosaurid tooth embedded in it reported by Buffetaut and colleagues confirmed that the latter were not exclusively piscivorous.

A 2005 beam-theory study by the palaeontologist François Therrien and colleagues was unable to reconstruct force profiles of &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, but found that the related &quot;Suchomimus&quot; would have used the front part of its jaws to capture prey, and suggested that the jaws of spinosaurids were adapted for hunting smaller terrestrial prey in addition to fish. They envisaged that spinosaurids could have captured smaller prey with the rosette of teeth at the front of the jaws, and finished it by shaking it. Larger prey would instead have been captured and killed with their forelimbs instead of their bite, since their skulls would not be able to resist the bending stress. They also agreed that the conical teeth of spinosaurids were well-developed for impaling and holding prey, with their shape enabling them to withstand bending loads from all directions. A 2007 finite element analysis of CT scanned snouts by the palaeontologist Emily J. Rayfield and colleagues indicated that the biomechanics of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; were most similar to those of the gharial and unlike those of the American alligator and more-conventional theropods, supporting a piscivorous diet for spinosaurids. Their secondary palate helped them resist bending and torsion of their tubular snouts. A 2013 beam-theory study by the palaeontologists Andrew R. Cuff and Rayfield compared the biomechanics of CT-scanned spinosaurid snouts with those of extant crocodilians, and found the snouts of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; similar in their resistance to bending and torsion. &quot;Baryonyx&quot; was found to have relatively high resistance in the snout to dorsoventral bending compared with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and the gharial. The authors concluded (in contrast to the 2007 study) that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; performed differently than the gharial; spinosaurids were not exclusive piscivores, and their diet was determined by their individual size.

In a 2014 conference abstract, the palaeontologist Danny Anduza and Fowler pointed out that grizzly bears do not gaff fish out of the water as was suggested for &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, and also ruled out that the dinosaur would not have darted its head like herons, since the necks of spinosaurids were not strongly S-curved, and their eyes were not well-positioned for binocular vision. Instead, they suggested the jaws would have made sideways sweeps to catch fish, like the gharial, with the hand claws probably used to stamp down and impale large fish, whereafter they manipulated them with their jaws, in a manner similar to grizzly bears and fishing cats. They did not find the teeth of spinosaurids suitable for dismembering prey, due to their lack of serrations, and suggested they would have swallowed prey whole (while noting they could also have used their claws for dismemberment).

A 2016 study by the palaeontologist Christophe Hendrickx and colleagues found that adult spinosaurs could displace their mandibular rami (halves of the lower jaw) sideways when the jaw was depressed, which allowed the pharynx (opening that connects the mouth to the oesophagus) to be widened. This jaw-articulation is similar to that seen in pterosaurs and living pelicans, and would likewise have allowed spinosaurids to swallow large prey such as fish and other animals. They also reported that some possible Portuguese &quot;Baryonyx&quot; fossils were found associated with isolated &quot;Iguanodon&quot; teeth, and listed it along with other such associations as support for opportunistic feeding behaviour in spinosaurs. Another 2016 study by the palaeontologist Romain Vullo and colleagues found that the jaws of spinosaurids were convergent with those of pike conger eels; these fish also have jaws that are compressed side to side (whereas the jaws of crocodilians are compressed from top to bottom), an elongated snout with a &quot;terminal rosette&quot; that bears enlarged teeth, and a notch behind the rosette with smaller teeth. Such jaws likely evolved for grabbing prey in aquatic environments with low light, and may have helped in prey detection.

A 2023 study by Barker and colleagues based on CT scans of the braincases of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; and &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot; found that the brain anatomy of these baryonychines was similar to that of other non-maniraptoriform theropods. Their neurosensory capabilities such as hearing and olfaction (sense of smell) were unexceptional, and their gaze stabilisation less developed than those of spinosaurines, so their behavioural adaptations were probably comparable to those of other large-bodied terrestrial theropods. This suggests that their transition from terrestrial hypercarnivores to semi-aquatic “generalists” during their evolution did not require substantial modification of their brain and sensory systems. This could mean that spinosaurids were either pre-adapted for detection and capture of aquatic prey, or that their transition to semi-aquatic lifestyles only required modifications to the bones associated with the mouth. Their reptile encephalization quotient values imply that the cognitive capacity and behavioural sophistication of baryonychines did not deviate much from that of other basal theropods.

===Motion and semi-aquatic habits===
In their original description, Charig and Milner did not consider &quot;Baryonyx&quot; to be aquatic (due to its nostrils being on the sides of its snout—far from the tip—and the form of the post-cranial skeleton), but thought it was capable of swimming, like most land vertebrates. They speculated that the elongated skull, long neck, and strong humerus of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; indicated that the animal was a facultative quadruped, unique among theropods. In their 1997 article they found no skeletal support for this, but maintained that the forelimbs would have been strong enough for a quadrupedal posture and it would probably have caught aquatic prey while crouching—or on all fours—near (or in) water. A 2014 re-description of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; by the palaeontologist Nizar Ibrahim and colleagues based on new remains suggested that it was a quadruped, based on its anterior centre of body mass. The authors found quadrupedality unlikely for &quot;Baryonyx&quot;, since the better-known legs of the closely related &quot;Suchomimus&quot; did not support this posture.

In 2017, the palaeontologists David E. Hone and Holtz hypothesized that the head crests of spinosaurids were probably used for sexual or threat display. The authors also pointed out that (like other theropods) there was no reason to believe that the forelimbs of &quot;Baryonyx&quot; were able to pronate (crossing the radius and ulna bones of the lower arm to turn the hand), and thereby make it able to rest or walk on its palms. Resting on or using the forelimbs for locomotion may have been possible (as indicated by tracks of a resting theropod), but if this was the norm, the forelimbs would probably have showed adaptations for this. Hone and Holtz furthermore suggested that the forelimbs of spinosaurids do not seem optimal for trapping prey, but instead appear similar to the forelimbs of digging animals. They suggested that the ability to dig would have been useful when excavating nests, digging for water, or to reach some kinds of prey. Hone and Holtz also believed that spinosaurids would have waded and dipped in water rather than submerging themselves, due to their sparsity of aquatic adaptations.

A 2010 study by the palaeontologist Romain Amiot and colleagues proposed that spinosaurids were semi-aquatic, based on the oxygen isotope composition of spinosaurid teeth from around the world compared with that of other theropods and extant animals. Spinosaurids probably spent much of the day in water, like crocodiles and hippopotamuses, and had a diet similar to the former; both were opportunistic predators. Since most spinosaurids do not appear to have anatomical adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, the authors proposed that submersion in water was a means of thermoregulation similar to that of crocodiles and hippopotamuses. Spinosaurids may also have turned to aquatic habitats and piscivory to avoid competition with large, more-terrestrial theropods. In 2016, Sales and colleagues statistically examined the fossil distribution of spinosaurids, abelisaurids, and carcharodontosaurids, and concluded that spinosaurids had the strongest support for association with coastal palaeoenvironments. Spinosaurids also appear to have inhabited inland environments (with their distribution there being comparable to carcharodontosaurids), which indicates they may have been more generalist than usually thought.

Sales and Schultz agreed in 2017 that spinosaurids were semi-aquatic and partially piscivorous, based on skull features such as conical teeth, snouts that were compressed from side to side, and retracted nostrils. They interpreted the fact that histological data indicates some spinosaurids were more terrestrial than others as reflecting ecological niche partitioning among them. As some spinosaurids have smaller nostrils than others, their olfactory abilities were presumably lesser, as in modern piscivorous animals, and they may instead have used other senses (such as vision and mechanoreception) when hunting fish. Olfaction may have been more useful for spinosaurids that also fed on terrestrial prey, such as baryonychines. A 2022 study by the palaeontologist Matteo Fabbri and colleagues revealed that &quot;Baryonyx&quot; possessed dense bones that would have allowed it to dive underwater. This same adaptation was revealed in the related &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, and they are believed to have been subaqueous foragers that dived after aquatic prey, while &quot;Suchomimus&quot; was better adapted to a non-diving lifestyle by comparison according to the provided analysis. This discovery also showcases the unique and ecologically disparate lifestyles spinosaurids had, with more hollow-boned genera preferring to hunt in shallower water.

==Palaeoenvironment==
The Weald Clay Formation consists of sediments of Hauterivian (Lower Weald Clay) to Barremian (Upper Weald Clay) age, about 130–125 million years old. The original &quot;Baryonyx&quot; specimen was found in the latter, in clay representing non-marine still water, which has been interpreted as a fluvial or mudflat environment with shallow water, lagoons, and marshes. During the Early Cretaceous, the Weald area of Surrey, Sussex, and Kent was partly covered by the large, fresh-to-brackish water Wealden Lake. Two large rivers drained the northern area (where London now stands), flowing into the lake through a river delta; the Anglo-Paris Basin was in the south. Its climate was sub-tropical, similar to the present Mediterranean region. Since the Smokejack Clay Pit consists of different stratigraphic levels, fossil taxa found there are not necessarily contemporaneous. Dinosaurs from the locality include the ornithopods &quot;Mantellisaurus&quot;, &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, and small sauropods. Other vertebrates from the Weald Clay include crocodiles, pterosaurs, lizards (such as &quot;Dorsetisaurus&quot;), amphibians, sharks (such as &quot;Hybodus&quot;), and bony fishes (including &quot;Scheenstia&quot;). Members of ten orders of insects have been identified, including &quot;Valditermes&quot;, &quot;Archisphex&quot;, and &quot;Pterinoblattina&quot;. Other invertebrates include ostracods, isopods, conchostracans, and bivalves. The plants &quot;Weichselia&quot; and the aquatic, herbaceous &quot;Bevhalstia&quot; were common. Other plants found include ferns, horsetails, club mosses, and conifers.

Other dinosaurs from the Wessex Formation of the Isle of Wight where &quot;Baryonyx&quot; may have occurred include the theropods &quot;Riparovenator&quot;, &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot;, &quot;Neovenator&quot;, &quot;Eotyrannus&quot;, &quot;Aristosuchus&quot;, &quot;Thecocoelurus&quot;, &quot;Calamospondylus&quot;, and &quot;Ornithodesmus&quot;; the ornithopods &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, &quot;Hypsilophodon&quot;, and &quot;Valdosaurus&quot;; the sauropods &quot;Ornithopsis&quot;, &quot;Eucamerotus&quot;, and &quot;Chondrosteosaurus&quot;; and the ankylosaur &quot;Polacanthus&quot;. Barker and colleagues stated in 2021 that the identification of the two additional spinosaurids from the Wealden Supergroup, &quot;Riparovenator&quot; and &quot;Ceratosuchops&quot;, has implications for potential ecological separation within Spinosauridae if these and &quot;Baryonyx&quot; were contemporary and interacted. They cautioned that it is possible the Upper Weald Clay and Wessex Formations and the spinosaurids known from them were separated in time and distance.
It is generally thought that large predators occur with small taxonomic diversity in any area due to ecological demands, yet many Mesozoic assemblages include two or more sympatric theropods that were comparable in size and morphology, and this also appears to have been the case for spinosaurids. Barker and colleagues suggested that high diversity within Spinosauridae in a given area may have been the result of environmental circumstances benefiting their niche. While it has been generally assumed that only identifiable anatomical traits related to resource partitioning allowed for coexistence of large theropods, Barker and colleagues noted that this does not preclude that similar and closely related taxa could coexist and overlap in ecological requirements. Possible niche partitioning could be in time (seasonal or daily), in space (between habitats in the same ecosystems), or depending on conditions, and they could also have been separated by their choice of habitat within their regions (which may have ranged in climate).

===Taphonomy===

Charig and Milner presented a possible scenario explaining the taphonomy (changes during decay and fossilisation) of the &quot;B. walkeri&quot; holotype specimen. The fine-grained sediments around the skeleton, and the fact that the bones were found close together (skull and forelimb elements at one end of the excavation area and the pelvis and hind-limb elements at the other), indicates that the environment was quiet at the time of deposition, and water currents did not carry the carcass far—possibly because the water was shallow. The area where the specimen died seems to have been suitable for a piscivorous animal. It may have caught fish and scavenged on the mud plain, becoming mired before it died and was buried. Since the bones are well-preserved and had no gnaw marks, the carcass appears to have been undisturbed by scavengers (suggesting that it was quickly covered by sediment).

The disarticulation of the bones may have been the result of soft-tissue decomposition. Parts of the skeleton seem to have weathered to different degrees, perhaps because water levels changed or the sediments shifted (exposing parts of the skeleton). The girdle and limb bones, the dentary, and a rib were broken before fossilisation, perhaps from trampling by large animals while buried. Most of the tail appears to have been lost before fossilisation, perhaps due to scavenging, or having rotted and floated off. The orientation of the bones indicates that the carcass lay on its back (perhaps tilted slightly to the left, with the right side upwards), which may explain why all the lower teeth had fallen out of their sockets and some upper teeth were still in place.

<text>Staurikosaurus (Pronounced , &quot;&quot;; &quot;Southern Cross lizard&quot;) is a genus of herrerasaurid dinosaur from the Late Triassic of Brazil, found in the Santa Maria Formation.

== Description ==

Colbert (1970) described &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; as a small and agile, bipedal predator. &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; lived during the late-Carnian and early-Norian stage, of the Late Triassic, approximately 225 million years ago—which makes it one of the earliest dinosaurs known. Its length is measured at long, but Gregory S. Paul presented a lower length estimate of and a body mass estimate of . &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was small in comparison to later theropods like &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;. The type specimen has long but relatively slender limb bones.

There exists a very incomplete fossil record of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;, consisting of most of the spine, the legs and the large lower jaw. However, dating from such an early period in the dinosaurs&#x27; history and being otherwise so primitive, most of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;&#x27; other features as being primitive also can be reconstructed. For example, &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; is usually depicted with five toes and five fingers—very simple features of an unspecialized dinosaur. However, since the skeletal structure of the legs is known, it can be seen that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was a quick runner for its size. It also had just two vertebrae joining the pelvis to the spine, a distinctly primitive condition.

The available teeth for &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; bear a morphology that strongly suggests a carnivorous diet. The teeth are all serrated, laterally compressed, and caudally curved (i.e. the top of each tooth is curved back toward the throat). This dentition suggests that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; could catch and hold prey, as well as slice and tear flesh to aid in mechanical digestion.

The tail of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was relatively long (with more than 40 vertebrae) compared to the rest of its body and was held straight and off the ground as it ran. The rear part of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;″s tail is stiffened by features of the tail vertebrae. Ostrom (1969a) considered this adaptation to serve as a dynamic stabilizer facilitating the animal&#x27;s leaping and running.

A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Sues (1990), &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; can be distinguished based on the following 14 features: (i) a mandible almost as long as the femur, suggesting a proportionately large head; (ii) a fairly deep but thin dentary with 13 to 14 teeth and with a well-developed retroarticular process; (iii) a vertebral column with 9 to 10 cervical, 15 dorsal, 2 sacral, and more than 40 caudal vertebrae. &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; is considered to be more primitive than any other dinosaur because only two sacral vertebrae are present; (iv) an elongated 3rd, 4th, and 5th cervical vertebrae, which represents a primitive condition; (v) cranial cervical vertebrae that lack epipophyses; (vi) the absence of accessory intervertebral articulations; (vii) a slender scapular blade that is not expanded proximally; (viii) a large and plate-like coracoid; (ix) a humerus featuring a prominent deltopectoral crest (represents a primitive condition) as well having distinctly expanded articular ends; (x) an ilium with an extensively developed medial wall of a semiperforate acetabulum (like &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot;, but unlike any other dinosaur); (xi) a long pubis, two-thirds the length of the femur; (xii) hollow limb bones that feature fairly thick walls; (xiii) a robust femur with an S-shaped shaft: and (xiv) a tibia and fibula slightly longer than the femur. Novas (1993) added that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; is distinguished from other dinosaurs based on the presence of a distal bevel on anterior margin of its pubis. Langer and Benton (2006) noted that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; can be distinguished based on the anterior trochanter being reduced to a scar. Bittencourt and Kellner (2009) also noted that the proximal fibula has a medial sulcus, which is unique to &quot;Staurikosaurus pricei.&quot;

== Discovery and occurrence ==

&quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; is named after the &quot;Southern Cross&quot; the star constellation visible from the Southern Hemisphere (from the Greek “Stauros” meaning cross and &quot;saurus&quot; meaning lizard), thus &quot;Cross Lizard&quot;. The species name &quot;pricei&quot; is in the honor of paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price.

The first known specimen of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; (MCZ 1669) was recovered from the Paleontological Site Jazigo Cinco of the Santa Maria Formation, Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was found in mid-Carnian sediments. The genus name refers to the star constellation &quot;The Southern Cross&quot;, pictured in the coat of arms of Brazil and only visible in the Southern Hemisphere—when &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was described in 1970, it was unusual to find dinosaurs in the Southern Hemisphere. The specific name honors the Brazilian paleontologist Llewellyn Ivor Price, who discovered it in 1936. It was described by Edwin Harris Colbert, working at the American Museum of Natural History. The rarity of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; remains may be a result of it being uncommon while alive, or because it lived in an environment like a forest, where fossils rarely form. Nonetheless, Garcia et al. (2019) referred the holotype of &quot;Teyuwasu barberenai&quot; as a second specimen of &quot;Staurikosaurus pricei&quot; (see Classification).

== Classification ==
Later research by Sues et al. (2011) supports that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; and the related genus &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot; are theropods and evolved after the sauropod line had split from the Theropoda. Mortimer points out that Benedetto (1973) and Galton (1985) were the first to recognize that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Herrerasaurus &quot;were more closely related to each other than to sauropodomorphs or avepods, placing them both in the Herrerasauridae and Herrerasauria. &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; differs from &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot; because of its considerably smaller size (femur length of vs. ). Sereno et al. (1993) concluded that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was not a theropod and considered it a basal saurischian outside Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha.&quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was originally incorrectly assigned by Colbert to Palaeosauriscidae, a defunct family based largely on &quot;Efraasia&quot;, a prosauropod dinosaur. All major phylogenetic analyses since 1994 have assigned &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; to the clade Herrerasauridae, which is the current scientific consensus on classification of this genus. Bittencourt and Kellner (2009) stated that the phylogenetic position of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; is constrained by its close relationship with &quot;Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis&quot;, which is more complete and well known. Below is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Sues et al. in 2011, showing the relationships of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;:

=== Related genera ===
&quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was placed in the clade Herrerasauridae by Benedetto in 1973. Herrerasauridae also includes &quot;Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis&quot;, both small predatory animals that were either dinosaurs or precursors to dinosaurs. These three dinosaurs lived during the Carnian stage of the Triassic period. Most phylogenetic analyses excluded &quot;Eoraptor&quot; from the Herrerasauridae. Phylogenetic analysis by Sues, Nesbitt, Berman and Henrici, in 2011, exclude &quot;Eoraptor&quot;, and include &quot;Chindesaurus&quot; along with &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot; as more derived than &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;. &quot;Sanjuansaurus&quot; was assigned to Herrerasauridae by Alcober and Martínez (2010). Sues (1990) assigned Ischisaurus to Herrerasauridae. Other proposed members of the clade have included &quot;Sanjuansaurus&quot; from the same Ischigualasto Formation of Argentina as &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot;, and possibly &quot;Caseosaurus&quot; from the Dockum Formation of Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Alcober and Martinez (2010) concluded that &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; and &quot;Sanjuansaurus&quot; are closely related based on similarities in their pubis and tibia.

=== Synonyms ===

The controversial dinosauriform &quot;Teyuwasu barberenai&quot; was recently considered a synonym of &quot;Staurikosaurus pricei&quot;. Both taxa are known from single incomplete and somewhat poorly preserved specimens, therefore the former holotype specimen of &quot;Teyuwasu&quot; would be the second specimen ascribed to &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; within almost 50 years of its naming. The synonymy was based on a combination of five osteological features that are only present in both specimens among Triassic early dinosauriforms: (i) femur without a trochanteric shelf; (ii) symmetric fourth trochanter of the femur; (iii) crista tibiofibularis poorly separated from the lateral condyle at the distal end of the femur; (iv) posterolateral flange of the distal end of the tibia does not exceeds the lateral margin of the bone; (v) and rounded distal end of the tibia.

The synonymy is commented in two subsequent papers, which cast doubt in the association of &quot;Teyuwasu&quot; with &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;. In the first paper, the authors only mention that the holotype of &quot;Teyuwasu&quot; is not well preserved, and thus cannot be attributed to &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;. In the second, the authors argue that several of the five character states cited to unite the taxa are present in immature specimens of other dinosauriforms. However, the combination (that is, the simultaneous presence) of the five characters listed by Garcia et al. is not present in any of the aforementioned dinosauriforms, and therefore remains unique between &quot;&quot;Teyuwasu&quot; and &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;.

Therefore, further investigations are needed in order to whether confirm or not the synonymy between &quot;Teyuwasu barberenai&quot;&quot; and &quot;Staurikosaurus pricei&quot;.

== Paleobiology ==
=== Feeding ===
&quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; was a small but active bipedal predator, that preyed on small and medium-sized terrestrial vertebrates such as cynodonts, rhynchosaurs, and herbivorous synapsids. The mandible of &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; suggests that a sliding joint in the jaw allowed it to move backwards and forwards, as well as up and down. However, some authors questioned the presence of an intramandibular joint in &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;, due to the poor preservation of the holotype. Smaller prey could be worked backwards towards &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;″s throat, aided along by its small, backwards-curving teeth. This feature was common in theropods of its time, but would disappear in later theropods.

== Paleoecology ==

During the Late Triassic dinosaurs played only a minor role in terrestrial life; a fact that would change by the Early Jurassic. &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot; coexisted with large rauisuchian archosaurs like &quot;Rauisuchus&quot;, which were the top carnivores in their ecosystem &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;″s paleocommunity included medium- to large-sized herbivorous rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts. Medium-sized omnivorous aetosaurs and cynodonts were also present. Dinosaurs were represented by the Herrerasaurids, which include &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;, and the basal sauropodomorph &quot;Saturnalia&quot;. The contemporaneous occurrence of basal theropods &quot;Staurikosaurus&quot;, &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot;, and &quot;Eoraptor&quot; with the ornithischian &quot;Pisanosaurus&quot; suggests that the main carnivorous and herbivorous lineages were established during the middle part of the Carnian stage. A U-Pb (uranium decay) dating found that the Santa Maria Formation dated around 233.23 million years ago, putting it 1.5 million years older than the Ischigualasto Formation, and making the two formations approximately equal as the earliest dinosaur localities.

<text>Coelophysis ( traditionally; or , as heard more commonly in recent decades) is a genus of coelophysid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 215 to 208.5 million years ago during the Late Triassic period from the middle to late Norian age in what is now the southwestern United States. &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; was once considered to be a species within this genus, but this interpretation has been challenged since 2017 and the genus &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; is now considered valid.

&quot;Coelophysis&quot; was a small, slenderly built, ground-dwelling, bipedal carnivore that could grow up to long. It is one of the earliest known dinosaur genera. Scattered material representing similar animals has been found worldwide in some Late Triassic and Early Jurassic formations.

The type species &quot;C. bauri&quot;, originally given to the genus &quot;Coelurus&quot; by Edward Drinker Cope in 1887, was described by the latter in 1889. The names &quot;Longosaurus&quot; and &quot;Rioarribasaurus&quot; are synonymous with &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. &quot;Coelophysis&quot; is one of the most specimen-rich dinosaur genera.

== History of discovery ==

The type species of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was originally named as a species of &quot;Coelurus&quot;. Edward Drinker Cope first named &quot;Coelophysis&quot; in 1889 to name a new genus, outside of &quot;Coelurus&quot; and &quot;Tanystropheus,&quot; which &quot;C. bauri&quot; was previously classified in, for &quot;C. bauri&quot;, &quot;C. willistoni&quot;, and &quot;C. longicollis&quot;. David Baldwin, an amateur fossil collector working for Cope, had found the first remains of the dinosaur in 1881 in the Chinle Formation in northwestern New Mexico. Early in 1887, Cope referred the specimens collected to two new species, &quot;C. bauri&quot; and &quot;C. longicollis&quot; of the genus &quot;Coelurus&quot;. Later on in 1887, Cope reassigned the material to a yet another genus, &quot;Tanystropheus&quot;. Two years later, Cope corrected his classification after realizing differences in the vertebrae and named &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, with &quot;C. bauri&quot; as the type species, which was named for Georg Baur, a comparative anatomist whose ideas were similar to Cope&#x27;s. The name &quot;Coelophysis&quot; comes from the Greek words κοῖλος/koilos (meaning &#x27;hollow&#x27;) and φύσις/physis (meaning &#x27;form&#x27;), together &quot;hollow form&quot;, which is a reference to its hollow vertebrae. However, the first finds were too poorly preserved to give a complete picture of the new dinosaur.

In 1947, a substantial &quot;graveyard&quot; of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; fossils was found by George Whitaker, the assistant of Edwin H. Colbert, in New Mexico, at Ghost Ranch, close to the original find. American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Edwin H. Colbert conducted a comprehensive study of all the fossils found up to that date and assigned them to &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. The Ghost Ranch specimens were so numerous, including many well-preserved and fully articulated specimens, that one of them has since become the diagnostic, or type specimen, for the entire genus, replacing the original, poorly preserved specimen.
In the early 1990s, there was debate over the diagnostic characteristics of the first specimens collected, compared to the material excavated at the Ghost Ranch &quot;Coelophysis&quot; quarry. Some paleontologists were of the opinion that the original specimens were not diagnostic beyond themselves and, therefore, that the name &quot;C. bauri&quot; could not be applied to any additional specimens. They therefore applied a different name, &quot;Rioarribasaurus&quot;, to the Ghost Ranch quarry specimens.

Since the numerous well-preserved Ghost Ranch specimens were used as &quot;Coelophysis&quot; in most of the scientific literature, the use of &quot;Rioarribasaurus&quot; would have been very inconvenient for researchers. So, a petition was given to have the type specimen of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; transferred from the poorly preserved original specimen to one of the well-preserved Ghost Ranch specimens. This would make &quot;Rioarribasaurus&quot; a definite synonym of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, specifically a junior objective synonym. In the end, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) voted to make one of the Ghost Ranch samples the actual type specimen for &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and dispose of the name &quot;Rioarribasaurus&quot; altogether (declaring it a &quot;nomen rejectum&quot;, or &quot;rejected name&quot;), thus resolving the confusion. The name &quot;Coelophysis&quot; became a &quot;nomen conservandum&quot; (&quot;conserved name&quot;).

In a situation affecting many dinosaur taxa, some more recently discovered fossils were originally classified as new genera, but may be species of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. For example, Prof. Mignon Talbot&#x27;s 1911 discovery, which she named &quot;Podokesaurus holyokensis&quot;, has long been considered to be related to &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and some modern scientists consider &quot;Podokesaurus&quot; a synonym of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. Another specimen from the Portland Formation of the Hartford Basin, now at the Boston Museum of Science, has also been referred to &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. The specimen consists of sandstone casts of a pubis, tibia, three ribs, and a possible vertebra that probably originated in a quarry in Middletown, Connecticut. However, both the type specimen of &quot;Podokesaurus&quot; and the Middletown specimen are typically considered indeterminate theropods today.

Sullivan &amp; Lucas (1999) referred one specimen from Cope&#x27;s original material of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; (AMNH 2706) to what they thought was a newly discovered theropod, &quot;Eucoelophysis&quot;. However, subsequent studies have shown that &quot;Eucoelophysis&quot; was misidentified and is actually a silesaurid, a type of non-dinosaurian ornithodiran closely related to &quot;Silesaurus&quot;.

===Formerly assigned species===
&quot;&quot;Syntarsus&quot; rhodesiensis&quot; was first described by Raath (1969) and assigned to Podokesauridae. The taxon &quot;Podokesauridae&quot;, was abandoned because its type specimen was destroyed in a fire and can no longer be compared to new finds. Over the years, paleontologists assigned the genus to Ceratosauridae (Welles, 1984), Procompsognathidae (Parrish and Carpenter, 1986), and Ceratosauria (Gauthier, 1986). In 2004, &quot;Syntarsus&quot; was found to be synonymous with &quot;Coelophysis&quot; by Tykoski and Rowe (2004). Ezcurra and Novas (2007) and Ezcurra (2007) also concluded that &quot;Syntarsus&quot; was synonymous with &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. In a phylogenetic analysis by Ezcurra (2017), &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; was recovered in a clade with &quot;Segisaurus&quot; and &quot;Camposaurus&quot;, supporting the generic distinction of &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;. This was supported by Barta and colleagues in 2018, noting that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; still bears the vestigial 5th metacarpal, a feature absent in &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;.

The genus &quot;Syntarsus&quot; was named by Raath in 1969 for the type species &quot;Syntarsus rhodesiensis&quot; from Africa and later applied to the North American &quot;Syntarsus kayentakatae&quot;. It was renamed by American entomologist Dr. Michael Ivie (Montana State University of Bozeman), Polish Australian Dr. Adam Ślipiński, and Polish Dr. Piotr Węgrzynowicz (Muzeum Ewolucji Instytutu Zoologii PAN of Warsaw), the three scientists who discovered that the genus name &quot;Syntarsus&quot; was already taken by a colydiine beetle described in 1869. Many paleontologists did not like the naming of &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;, partially because taxonomists are generally expected to allow original authors of a name to correct any mistakes in their work. Raath was aware of the homonymy between the dinosaur &quot;Syntarsus&quot; and beetle &quot;Syntarsus&quot;, but the group who published &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; have claimed that they believed Raath was deceased and unable to correct his mistake, so they proceeded accordingly. Mortimer (2012) pointed out that &quot;Paleontologists might have reacted more positively if the replacement name (&quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;) hadn&#x27;t been facetious, translating to &quot;big dead lizard&quot;. Yates (2005) analyzed &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; and concluded that the two genera are almost identical, suggesting that &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; was possibly synonymous with &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. In 2004, Raath co-authored two papers in which he argued that &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; (formerly &quot;Syntarsus&quot;) was a junior synonym of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; was regarded by Paul (1988) and Downs (2000) as being congeneric with &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. In 1993, Paul then suggested that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; should be placed in &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot; (then known as &quot;Syntarsus&quot;) to get around the above-mentioned taxonomic confusion. Downs (2000) examined &quot;Camposaurus&quot; and concluded that it was a junior synonym of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; because of its similarity to some of the &quot;Coelophysis&quot; Ghost Ranch specimens. However, a reassessment of the &quot;Camposaurus&quot; holotype by Martin Ezcurra and Stephen Brusatte, published in 2011, revealed a pair of autapomorphies in the holotype, indicating that &quot;C. arizonensis&quot; was not a synonym of &quot;C. bauri&quot;, although it was a close relative of &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot;. Barta &quot;et al&quot;. (2018) concluded that &quot;C. bauri&quot; differed from &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot; in that it bears its 5th metacarpal and several features in the musculature of the limbs according to Griffin (2018).

== Description ==

&quot;Coelophysis&quot; is known from a number of complete fossil skeletons of the species &quot;C. bauri&quot;. This lightly built dinosaur measured up to long and was more than a meter tall at the hips. Gregory S. Paul (1988) estimated the weight of the gracile form at and the weight of the robust form at , but later presented a higher estimate of . &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was a bipedal, carnivorous, theropod dinosaur and a fast, agile runner. Despite its basal position within Theropoda, the bauplan of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; differed from those of other basal theropods, such as &quot;Herrerasaurus&quot;, showing more derived traits common in theropods that superseded it. The torso of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; conforms to the basic theropod bauplan, but the pectoral girdle displays some special characteristics. &quot;C. bauri&quot; had a furcula (wishbone), the earliest known example in a dinosaur. &quot;Coelophysis&quot; also preserves the ancestral condition of possessing four digits on the hand (manus). It had only three functional digits, with the fourth being embedded in the flesh of the hand.

&quot;Coelophysis&quot; had narrow hips, arms adapted for grasping prey, and narrow feet. Its neck and tail were long and slender. The pelvis and hindlimbs of &quot;C. bauri&quot; are also slight variations on the theropod body plan. It has the open acetabulum and straight ankle hinge that define Dinosauria. The leg ended in a three-toed foot (pes) with a raised dewclaw (hallux). The tail had an unusual structure within its interlocking prezygapophysis of its vertebrae, which formed a semi-rigid lattice, apparently to stop the tail from moving up and down.
&quot;Coelophysis&quot; had a long and narrow head (approximately ), with large, forward-facing eyes that afforded it stereoscopic vision and, as a result, excellent depth perception. Rinehart &quot;et al.&quot; (2004) described the complete sclerotic ring found for a juvenile &quot;Coelophysis bauri&quot; (specimen NMMNH P-4200) and compared it to data on the sclerotic rings of reptiles (including birds), concluding that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was a diurnal, visually oriented predator. The study found that the vision of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was superior to most lizards&#x27; vision and ranked with that of modern birds of prey. The eyes of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; appear to be the closest to those of eagles and hawks, with a high power of accommodation. The data also suggested poor night vision, which would mean this dinosaur had a round pupil rather than a split pupil.

&quot;Coelophysis&quot; had an elongated snout with large fenestrae that helped to reduce skull weight, while narrow struts of bones preserved the structural integrity of the skull. The neck had a pronounced curve. The braincase is known in &quot;Coelophysis bauri&quot;, but little data could be derived because the skull was crushed. Unlike some other theropods, the cranial ornamentation of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was not located at the top of its skull. Low, laterally raised bony ridges were present on the dorsolateral margin of the nasal and lacrimal bones in the skull, directly above the antorbital fenestra.

=== Distinguishing anatomical features ===
A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group.

According to Ezcurra (2007) and Bristowe and Raath (2004), &quot;Coelophysis&quot; can be distinguished based on the absence of an offset rostral process of the maxilla, the quadrate being strongly caudally, a small external mandibular fenestra (which is 9–10% of the mandibular length), and the anteroposterior length of the ventral lacrimal process is greater than 30% of its height.

Several paleontologists consider &quot;Coelophysis bauri&quot; to be the same dinosaur as &quot;Megapnosaurus rhodesiensis&quot; (formerly &quot;Syntarsus&quot;). However, this has been refuted by many paleontologists. Downs (2000) concluded that &quot;C. bauri&quot; differs from &quot;C. rhodesiensis&quot; in cervical length, proximal and distal leg proportions, and proximal caudal vertebral anatomy. Tykoski and Rowe (2004) concluded that &quot;C. bauri&quot; differs from &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot; in that it lacks a pit at the base of the nasal process of the premaxilla. Bristowe and Raath (2004) concluded that &quot;C. bauri&quot; differs from &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot; in having a longer maxillary tooth row. Barta &quot;et al&quot;. (2018) concluded that &quot;C. bauri&quot; differed from &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot; in that it bears its 5th metacarpal. Griffin (2018) concluded that &quot;C. bauri&quot; differs from &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot; in several differences in the musculature of the limbs.

== Classification ==



&quot;Coelophysis&quot; is a distinct taxonomic unit (genus), composed of the single species &quot;C. bauri.&quot; Two additional originally described species, &quot;C. longicollis&quot; and &quot;C. willistoni&quot;, are now considered dubious and undiagnostic. &quot;M. rhodesiensis&quot; was referred to &quot;Coelophysis&quot; for several years, but it is likely its own genus and is known from the early Jurassic of southern Africa. A third possible species is &quot;Coelophysis kayentakatae&quot;, previously referred to the genus &quot;Megapnosaurus,&quot; from the Kayenta Formation of the southwestern US. In recent phylogenetic analyses, &quot;&quot;Syntarsus&quot; kayentakatae&quot; has been shown to be distantly related to &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and &quot;Megapnosaurus&quot;, suggesting that it belongs to its own genus.

== Paleobiology ==

=== Feeding ===

The teeth of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; were typical of predatory dinosaurs, as they were blade-like, recurved, sharp, jagged, and finely serrated on both the anterior and posterior edges. Its dentition shows that it was carnivorous, probably preying on the small, lizard-like animals that were discovered with it. It may also have hunted in packs to tackle larger prey. &quot;Coelophysis bauri&quot; has approximately 26 teeth on the maxillary bone of the upper jaw and 27 teeth on the dentary bone of the lower jaw. Kenneth Carpenter (2002) examined the bio-mechanics of theropod arms and attempted to evaluate their usefulness in predation. He concluded that the arm of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was flexible and had a good range of motion, but its bone structure suggested that it was comparatively weak. The &quot;weak&quot; arms and small teeth in this genus suggested that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; preyed upon animals that were substantially smaller than itself. Rinehart &quot;et al.&quot; agreed that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was a &quot;hunter of small, fast-moving prey&quot;. Carpenter also identified three distinct models of theropod arm use and noted that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was a &quot;combination grasper-clutcher&quot;, as compared to other dinosaurs that were &quot;clutchers&quot; or &quot;long armed graspers&quot;.

It has been suggested that &quot;C. bauri&quot; was a cannibal, based on supposed juvenile specimens found &quot;within&quot; the abdominal cavities of some Ghost Ranch specimens. However, Robert J. Gay showed in 2002 that these specimens were misinterpreted. Several specimens of &quot;juvenile coelophysids&quot; were actually small crurotarsan reptiles, such as &quot;Hesperosuchus&quot;. Gay&#x27;s position was lent support in a 2006 study by Nesbitt &quot;et al.&quot; In 2009, new evidence of cannibalism came to light when additional preparation of previously excavated matrix revealed regurgitate material in and around the mouth of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; specimen NMMNH P-44551. This material included tooth and jaw bone fragments that Rinehart &quot;et al.&quot; considered &quot;morphologically identical&quot; to a juvenile &quot;Coelophysis.&quot;

In 2010, Gay examined the bones of juveniles found within the thoracic cavity of AMNH 7224 and calculated that the total volume of these bones was 17 times greater than the maximum estimated stomach volume of the &quot;Coelophysis&quot; specimen. Gay observed that the total volume would be even greater when considering that there would have been flesh on these bones. This analysis also noted the absence of tooth marks on the bones as would be expected in defleshing and the absence of expected pitting by stomach acids. Finally, Gay demonstrated that the alleged cannibalized juvenile bones were deposited stratigraphically below the larger animal that had supposedly cannibalized them. Taken together, these data suggested that the &quot;Coelophysis&quot; specimen AMNH 7224 was not a cannibal and that the bones of the juvenile and adult specimens were found in their final position as a result of &quot;coincidental superposition of different sized individuals.

=== Pack behavior ===
The discovery of over 1,000 specimens of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; at the Whitaker quarry at Ghost Ranch has suggested gregarious behavior to researchers like Schwartz and Gillette. There is a tendency to see this massive congregation of animals as evidence for huge packs of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; roaming the land. No direct evidence for flocking exists because the deposits only indicate that large numbers of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, along with various other Triassic animals, were buried together. Some of the evidence from the taphonomy of the site indicates that these animals may have been gathered together to feed or drink from a depleted water hole or to feed on a spawning run of fish, being later buried in a catastrophic flash flood or a drought.

With 30 specimens of &quot;C. rhodesiensis&quot; found together in Zimbabwe, some palaeontologists have suggested that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was indeed gregarious. Again, there is no direct evidence of flocking in this case and it has also been suggested that these individuals were also victims of flash flooding as it appears to have been commonplace during this period.

=== Growth and sexual dimorphism ===

Rinehart (2009) assessed the ontogenic growth of this genus using data gathered from the length of its upper leg bone (femur) and concluded that &quot;Coelophysis&quot; juveniles grew rapidly, especially during the first year of life. &quot;Coelophysis&quot; likely reached sexual maturity between the second and third year of life and reached its full size, just above 10 feet in length, by its eighth year. This study identified four distinct growth stages: 1-year, 2-year, 4-year, and 7+ year. It was also thought that, as soon as they were hatched, they would have to fend for themselves.

Two &quot;morphs&quot; of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; have been identified. One is a more gracile form, as in specimen AMNH 7223, and the other is a slightly more robust form, as in specimens AMNH 7224 and NMMNH P-42200. Skeletal proportions were different between these two forms. The gracile form has a longer skull, a longer neck, shorter arms, and has sacral neural spines that are fused. The robust form has a shorter skull, a shorter neck, longer arms, and unfused sacral neural spines. Historically, many arguments have been made that this represents some sort of dimorphism in the population of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, probably sexual dimorphism. Raath agreed that dimorphism in &quot;Coelophysis&quot; is evidenced by the size and structure of the arm. Rinehart &quot;et al.&quot; studied 15 individuals, and agreed that two morphs were present, even in juvenile specimens, and suggested that sexual dimorphism was present early in life, prior to sexual maturity. Rinehart concluded that the gracile form was female and the robust form was male based on differences in the sacral vertebrae of the gracile form, which allowed for greater flexibility for egg laying. Further support for this position was provided by an analysis showing that each morph comprised 50% of the population, as would be expected in a 50/50 sex ratio.

However, more recent research has found that &quot;C. bauri&quot; and &quot;C. rhodesiensis&quot; had highly variable growth between individuals, with some specimens being larger in their immature phase than smaller adults were when completely mature. This indicates that the supposed presence of distinct morphs is simply the result of individual variation. This highly variable growth was likely ancestral to dinosaurs but later lost and may have given such early dinosaurs an evolutionary advantage in surviving harsh environmental challenges.

=== Reproduction ===
Through the compilation and analysis of a database of nearly three dozen reptiles (including birds) and comparison with existing data about the anatomy of &quot;Coelophysis&quot;, Rinehart &quot;et al.&quot; (2009) drew the following conclusions. It was estimated that average egg of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; was 31–33.5 millimeters across its minor diameter and that each female would lay between 24 and 26 eggs in each clutch. The evidence suggested that some parental care was necessary to nurture the relatively small hatchlings during the first year of life, where they would reach 1.5 meters in length by the end of their first growth stage. &quot;Coelophysis bauri&quot; invested as much energy in reproduction as other extinct reptiles of its approximate size.

=== Paleopathology ===
In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 14-foot bones referred to &quot;Coelophysis&quot; were examined for signs of stress fracture, but none were found.

In &quot;C. rhodesiensis&quot;, healed fractures of the tibia and metatarsus have been observed, but are very rare. &quot;[T]he supporting butresses of the second sacral rib&quot; in one specimen of &quot;Syntarsus rhodesiensis&quot; showed signs of fluctuating asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry results from developmental disturbances and is more common in populations under stress and can therefore be informative about the quality of conditions a dinosaur lived under.

== Ichnology ==

Edwin H. Colbert has suggested that the theropod footprints referred to the ichnogenus &quot;Grallator&quot;, located in the Connecticut River Valley across Connecticut and Massachusetts, may have been made by &quot;Coelophysis&quot;. The footprints are from the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic aged Newark Supergroup. They clearly show digits II, III, and IV, but not I or V. That condition is strange for footprints of their age. The digits I and V were presumed to be stubby and ineffective, not touching the ground when the dinosaur was walking or running. They have been thought to be from an unidentified, primitive saurischian similar to &quot;Coelophysis&quot; by David B. Weishampel and L. Young more recently. Skeletal remains resembling &quot;Coelophysis&quot; have also been found in the valley, supporting the idea that a species similar to &quot;Coelophysis&quot; is responsible for the footprints.

== Paleoenvironment ==
Specimens of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; have been recovered from the Chinle Formation of New Mexico and Arizona, more famously at the Ghost Ranch (Whitaker) quarry in the Rock Point member among other quarries in the underlying Petrified Forest member, the sediments of which have been dated to approximately 212 million years ago, making them part of the middle Norian stage of the Late Triassic, but Thomas Holtz Jr. interpreted that it was during the Rhaetian stage from approximately 204 to 201.6 million years ago.

&quot;C. rhodesiensis&quot; has been recovered in the Upper Elliott Formation in the Cape and Free State provinces of South Africa, as well as the Chitake River bonebed quarry at the Forest Sandstone Formation in Zimbabwe.

Ghost Ranch was located close to the equator over 200 million years ago, and had a warm, monsoon-like climate with heavy seasonal precipitation. Hayden Quarry, a new excavation site at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico, has yielded a diverse collection of fossil material that included the first evidence of dinosaurs and less-advanced dinosauromorphs from the same time period. The discovery indicates that the two groups lived together during the early Triassic period 235 million years ago.

Therrien and Fastovsky (2001) examined the paleoenvironment of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and other early theropods from Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona and determined that this genus lived in an environment that consisted of floodplains marked by distinct dry and wet seasons. There was a great deal of competition during drier times when animals struggled for water in riverbeds that were drying up.

In the upper sections of the Chinle Formation where &quot;Coelophysis&quot; is found, dinosaurs were rare. So far, only &quot;Chindesaurus&quot; and &quot;Daemonosaurus&quot; are known, the terrestrial fauna being dominated instead by other reptiles like the rhynchocephalian &quot;Whitakersaurus&quot;, the pseudosuchian &quot;Revueltosaurus&quot;, the aetosaurs &quot;Desmatosuchus&quot;, &quot;Typothorax&quot; and &quot;Heliocanthus&quot;, the crocodilomorph &quot;Hesperosuchus&quot;, the &quot;rauisuchians&quot; &quot;Shuvosaurus&quot;, &quot;Effigia&quot;, and &quot;Vivaron&quot;, along with other rare components like the dinosauriform &quot;Eucoelophysis&quot; and the amniote &quot;Kraterokheirodon&quot;. In the waterways there are the phytosaur &quot;Machaeroprosopus&quot;, the archosauromorph &quot;Vancleavea&quot;, the amphibians &quot;Apachesaurus&quot; and &quot;Koskinonodon&quot;, and the fishes &quot;Reticulodus&quot;, &quot;Arganodus&quot;, and &quot;Lasalichthyes&quot;.

=== Taphonomy ===
The multitude of specimens deposited so closely together at Ghost Ranch was probably the result of a flash flood that swept away a large number of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and buried them quickly and simultaneously. In fact, it seems that such flooding was commonplace during this period of the Earth&#x27;s history and, indeed, the Petrified Forest of nearby Arizona is the result of a preserved log jam of tree trunks that were caught in one such flood. Whitaker quarry at Ghost Ranch is considered a monotaxic site because it features multiple individuals of a single taxon. The quality of preservation and the ontogenic (age) range of the specimens helped make &quot;Coelophysis&quot; one of the best known of all genera. In 2009, Rinehart &quot;et al.&quot; noted that in one case the &quot;Coelophysis&quot; specimens were &quot;washed into a topographic low containing a small pond, where they probably drowned and were buried by a sheet flood event from a nearby river.&quot;

The 30 specimens of &quot;C. rhodesiensis&quot; found together in Zimbabwe was also probably the result of a flash flood that swept away a large number of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; and buried them quickly and simultaneously as well.

== Cultural significance ==
&quot;Coelophysis&quot; was the second dinosaur in space, following &quot;Maiasaura&quot; (STS-51-F). A &quot;Coelophysis&quot; skull from the Carnegie Museum of Natural History was aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-89 when it left the atmosphere on 22 January 1998. It was also taken onto the space station Mir before being returned to Earth.

Since the discovery of &quot;Coelophysis&quot; fossils more than 100 years ago, it is one of the best-known dinosaurs in literature. It was designated as the official state fossil of New Mexico in 1981 and is now the logo of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History.

<text>Hadrosaurids (), or hadrosaurs, are members of the ornithischian family Hadrosauridae. This group is known as the duck-billed dinosaurs for the flat duck-bill appearance of the bones in their snouts. The ornithopod family, which includes genera such as &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot;, was a common group of herbivores during the Late Cretaceous Period. Hadrosaurids are descendants of the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous iguanodontian dinosaurs and had a similar body layout. Hadrosaurs were among the most dominant herbivores during the Late Cretaceous in Asia and North America, and during the close of the Cretaceous several lineages dispersed into Europe, Africa, and South America.

Like other ornithischians, hadrosaurids had a predentary bone and a pubic bone which was positioned backwards in the pelvis. Unlike more primitive iguanodonts, the teeth of hadrosaurids are stacked into complex structures known as dental batteries, which acted as effective grinding surfaces. Hadrosauridae is divided into two principal subfamilies: the lambeosaurines (Lambeosaurinae), which had hollow cranial crests or tubes; and the saurolophines (Saurolophinae), identified as hadrosaurines (Hadrosaurinae) in most pre-2010 works, which lacked hollow cranial crests (solid crests were present in some forms). Saurolophines tended to be bulkier than lambeosaurines. Lambeosaurines included the aralosaurins, tsintaosaurins, lambeosaurins and parasaurolophins, while saurolophines included the brachylophosaurins, kritosaurins, saurolophins and edmontosaurins.

Hadrosaurids were facultative bipeds, with the young of some species walking mostly on two legs and the adults walking mostly on four.

==History of discovery==

Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden, during expeditions near the Judith River in 1854 through 1856, discovered the very first dinosaur fossils recognized from North America. These specimens were obtained by Joseph Leidy, who described and named them in 1856; two of the several species named were &quot;Trachodon mirabilis&quot; of the Judith River Formation and &quot;Thespesius occidentalis&quot; of the &quot;Great Lignite Formation&quot;. The former was based on a collection of teeth whilst the latter on two and a . Although most of the &quot;Trachodon&quot; teeth turned out to belong to ceratopsids, the holotype and remains of &quot;T. occidentalis&quot; would come to be recognized as the first recognized hadrosaur specimens. Around the same time in Philadelphia, on the other side of the continent, geologist William Parker Foulke was informed of numerous large bones accidentally uncovered by farmer John E. Hopkins some twenty years earlier. Foulke obtained permission to investigate the now scattered fossils in 1858, and these specimens as well were given to Leidy. They were described in the same year as &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;, giving a slightly better picture of the form of a hadrosaur. Leidy provided additional description in a 1865 paper. Among his 1858 work Leidy briefly suggested that the animal was likely amphibious in nature; this school of thought about hadrosaurs would come to be dominant for over a century to come.

Further discoveries such as &quot;&quot;Hadrosaurus minor&quot; and &quot;Ornithotarsus immanis&quot;&quot; would come from the East, and Edward Drinker Cope led an expedition to the Judith River Formation where &quot;Trachodon&quot; was found. Upon the fragments discovered he named seven new species in two genera, as well as assigning material to &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;. Cope had studied the jaws of hadrosaurs and come to the conclusion that the teeth were fragile and could have been dislodged incredibly easily. As such, he supposed the animals must have fed largely on soft water plants; he presented this idea to the Philadelphia Academy in 1883, and this idea would come to be very influential on future study. Research would continue in the Judith River area for years to come, but the formation never yielded much more than fragmentary remains, and Cope&#x27;s species as well as &quot;Trachodon&quot; itself would in time be seen as of doubtful validity. The Eastern states, too, would never yield particularly informative specimens. Instead, other sites in the American West would come to provide many very complete specimens that would form the backbone of hadrosaur research. One such specimen was the very complete AMNH 5060 (belonging to &quot;Edmontosaurus annectens&quot;), recovered in 1908 by the fossil collector Charles Hazelius Sternberg and his three sons in Converse County, Wyoming. It was described by Henry Osborn in 1912, who dubbed it the &quot;Dinosaur mummy&quot;. This specimen&#x27;s skin was almost completely preserved in the form of impressions. The skin around its hands, thought to represent webbing, was seen as further bolstering the idea that hadrosaurs were very aquatic animals.

Cope had planned to write a monograph about the group Ornithopoda, but never made much progress towards it before his death. This unrealized endeavor would come to be the inspiration for Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright to work on a similar project decades later. Eventually they realized the whole of Ornithopoda was too broad of a scope, until eventually it was narrowed down to specifically North American hadrosaurs. Their monograph, &quot;Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America&quot;, was published in 1942, and looked back at the whole of understanding about the family. It was designed as a definitive work, covering all aspects of their biology and evolution, and as part of it every known species was re-evaluated and many of them redescribed. They agreed with prior authors on the semi-aquatic nature of hadrosaurs, but re-evaluated Cope&#x27;s idea of weak jaws and found quite the opposite. The teeth were rooted in strong batteries and would be continuously replaced to prevent them getting worn down. Such a system seemed incredibly overbuilt for the job of eating soft Mesozoic plants, and this fact confused the authors. Though they still proposed a diet of water plants, they considered it likely this would be supplemented by occasional forrays into browsing on land plants.

Twenty years later, in 1964, another very important work would be published, this time by John H. Ostrom. It challenged the idea that hadrosaurs were semi-aquatic animals, which had been held since the work of Leidy back in the 1850s. This new approach was backed using evidence of the environment and climate they lived in, co-existing flora and fauna, physical anatomy, and preserved stomach contents from mummies. Based on evaluation of all this data, Ostrom found the idea that hadrosaurs were adapted for aquatic life incredibly lacking, and instead proposed they were capable terrestrial animals that browsed on plants such as conifers. He remained uncertain, however, as to the purpose of the paddle-like hand Osborn had described, as well as their long and somewhat paddle-like tails. Thus he agreed with the idea that hadrosaurs would have taken refuge from predators in water. Numerous important studies would follow this; Ostrom&#x27;s student Peter Dodson published a paper about lambeosaur skull anatomy that made enormous changes to hadrosaur taxonomy in 1975, and Michael K. Brett-Surman conducted a full revision of the group as part of his Graduate studies through the 1970s and 1980s. John R. Horner would also begin to leave his impact on the field, including with the naming of &quot;Maiasaura&quot; in 1979.

Hadrosaur research experienced a surge in the decade of the 2000s, similar to the research of other dinosaurs. In response to this, the Royal Ontario Museum and the Royal Tyrrell Museum collaborated to arrange the International Hadrosaur Symposium, a professional meeting about ongoing hadrosaur research that was held at the latter institution on September 22 and 23 in 2011. Over fifty presentations were made at the event, thirty-six of which were later incorporated into a book, titled &quot;Hadrosaurs&quot;, published in 2015. The volume was brought together primarily by palaeontologists David A. Eberth and David C. Evans, and featured an afterword from John R. Horner, all of whom also contributed to one or more of the studies published therein. The first chapter of the volume was a study by David B. Weishampel about the rate of ornithopod research over history, and the interest in different aspects of it over that history, using the 2004 volume &quot;The Dinosauria&quot; as the source of data on the amount of works published in each decade. Various periods of high and low activity were found, but the twenty-first century was found to overwhelmingly be the most prolific time, with over two-hundred papers published. The advent of the internet was cited as a likely catalyst for this boom. Hadrosaur research experienced high levels of diversity within the decade, with previously uncommon subjects such as growth, phylogeny, and biogeography experiencing more attention, though the functional morphology of hadrosaurids was found to have declined in study since the Dinosaur Renaissance.

== Distribution ==

Hadrosaurids likely originated in North America, before shortly dispersing into Asia. During the late Campanian-Maastrichtian, a saurolophine hadrosaurid migrated into South America from North America, giving rise to the clade Austrokritosauria, which is closely related to the tribe Kritosaurini. During the late early Maastrichtian, several lineages of Lambeosaurinae from Asia migrated into the European Ibero-Armorican Island (what is now France and Spain), including Arenysaurini and Tsintaosaurini. One of these lineages later dispersed from Europe into North Africa, as evidenced by &quot;Ajnabia,&quot; a member of Arenysaurini.

==Classification==
The family Hadrosauridae was first used by Edward Drinker Cope in 1869, then containing only &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;. Since its creation, a major division has been recognized in the group between the hollow-crested subfamily Lambeosaurinae and the subfamily Saurolophinae, historically known as Hadrosaurinae. Both of these have been robustly supported in all recent literature. Phylogenetic analysis has increased the resolution of hadrosaurid relationships considerably, leading to the widespread usage of tribes (a taxonomic unit below subfamily) to describe the finer relationships within each group of hadrosaurids.

Lambeosaurines have also been traditionally split into Parasaurolophini and Lambeosaurini. These terms entered the formal literature in Evans and Reisz&#x27;s 2007 redescription of &quot;Lambeosaurus magnicristatus&quot;. Lambeosaurini is defined as all taxa more closely related &quot;Lambeosaurus lambei&quot; than to &quot;Parasaurolophus walkeri&quot;, and Parasaurolophini as all those taxa closer to &quot;P. walkeri&quot; than to &quot;L. lambei&quot;. In recent years Tsintaosaurini and Aralosaurini have also emerged.

The use of the term &quot;Hadrosaurinae&quot; was questioned in a comprehensive study of hadrosaurid relationships by Albert Prieto-Márquez in 2010. Prieto-Márquez noted that, though the name Hadrosaurinae had been used for the clade of mostly crestless hadrosaurids by nearly all previous studies, its type species, &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;, has almost always been excluded from the clade that bears its name, in violation of the rules for naming animals set out by the ICZN. Prieto-Márquez defined Hadrosaurinae as just the lineage containing &quot;H. foulkii&quot;, and used the name Saurolophinae instead for the traditional grouping.

===Phylogeny===
Hadrosauridae was first defined as a clade, by Forster, in a 1997 abstract, as simply &quot;Lambeosaurinae plus Hadrosaurinae and their most recent common ancestor&quot;. In 1998, Paul Sereno defined the clade Hadrosauridae as the most inclusive possible group containing &quot;Saurolophus&quot; (a well-known saurolophine) and &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot; (a well-known lambeosaurine), later emending the definition to include &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, the type genus of the family. According to Horner &quot;et al.&quot; (2004), Sereno&#x27;s definition would place a few other well-known hadrosaurs (such as &quot;Telmatosaurus&quot; and &quot;Bactrosaurus&quot;) outside the family, which led them to define the family to include &quot;Telmatosaurus&quot; by default. Prieto-Marquez reviewed the phylogeny of Hadrosauridae in 2010, including many taxa potentially within the family. The family is now formally defined in the &quot;PhyloCode&quot; as &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;, &quot;Lambeosaurus lambei&quot;, and &quot;Saurolophus osborni&quot;&quot;. The two main subfamilies of Lambeosaurinae and Saurolophinae belong to the clade Euhadrosauria (sometimes called Saurolophidae), defined as &quot;the smallest clade containing &quot;Lambeosaurus lambei&quot; and &quot;Saurolophus osborni&quot;, provided it does not include &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot;&quot;. This clade excludes basal hadrosaurids such as &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Yamatosaurus&quot; but self-destructs if &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; is descended from the last common ancestor of &quot;Lambeosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saurolophus&quot;.


Below is a cladogram from Prieto-Marquez &quot;et al.&quot; 2016. This cladogram is a recent modification of the original 2010 analysis, including more characters and taxa. The resulting cladistic tree of their analysis was resolved using Maximum-Parsimony. 61 hadrosauroid species were included, characterized for 273 morphological features: 189 for cranial features and 84 for postcranial features. When characters had multiple states that formed an evolutionary scheme, they were ordered to account for the evolution of one state into the next. The final tree was run through TNT version 1.0.


The following cladogram is from Ramírez-Velasco (2022), including most recently named taxa.

==Anatomy==

The most recognizable aspect of hadrosaur anatomy is the flattened and laterally stretched rostral bones, which gives the distinct duck-bill look. Some members of the hadrosaurs also had massive crests on their heads, probably for display and/or to make noises. In some genera, including &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;, the whole front of the skull was flat and broadened out to form a beak, which was ideal for clipping leaves and twigs from the forests of Asia, Europe and North America. However, the back of the mouth contained thousands of teeth suitable for grinding food before it was swallowed. This has been hypothesized to have been a crucial factor in the success of this group in the Cretaceous compared to the sauropods.

Skin impressions of multiple hadrosaurs have been found. From these impressions, the hadrosaurs were determined to be scaled, and not feathered like some dinosaurs of other groups.

Hadrosaurs, much like sauropods, are noted for having their manus united in a fleshy, often nail-less pad.

The two major divisions of hadrosaurids are differentiated by their cranial ornamentation. While members of the Lambeosaurinae subfamily have hollow crests that differ depending on species, members of the Saurolophinae (Hadrosaurinae) subfamily have solid crests or none at all. Lambeosaurine crests had air chambers that may have produced a distinct sound and meant that their crests could have been used for both an audio and visual display.

==Paleobiology==
===Diet===
While studying the chewing methods of hadrosaurids in 2009, the paleontologists Vincent Williams, Paul Barrett, and Mark Purnell found that hadrosaurs likely grazed on horsetails and vegetation close to the ground, rather than browsing higher-growing leaves and twigs. This conclusion was based on the evenness of scratches on hadrosaur teeth, which suggested the hadrosaur used the same series of jaw motions over and over again. As a result, the study determined that the hadrosaur diet was probably made of leaves and lacked the bulkier items, such as twigs or stems, that might have required a different chewing method and created different wear patterns. However, Purnell said these conclusions were less secure than the more conclusive evidence regarding the motion of teeth while chewing.

The hypothesis that hadrosaurs were likely grazers rather than browsers appears to contradict previous findings from preserved stomach contents found in the fossilized guts in previous hadrosaur studies. The most recent such finding before the publication of the Purnell study was conducted in 2008, when a team led by University of Colorado at Boulder graduate student Justin S. Tweet found a homogeneous accumulation of millimeter-scale leaf fragments in the gut region of a well-preserved partially grown &quot;Brachylophosaurus&quot;. As a result of that finding, Tweet concluded in September 2008 that the animal was likely a browser, not a grazer. In response to such findings, Purnell said that preserved stomach contents are questionable because they do not necessarily represent the usual diet of the animal. The issue remains a subject of debate.
Mallon &quot;et al.&quot; (2013) examined herbivore coexistence on the island continent of Laramidia, during the Late Cretaceous. It was concluded that hadrosaurids could reach low-growing trees and shrubs that were out of the reach of ceratopsids, ankylosaurs, and other small herbivores. Hadrosaurids were capable of feeding up to a height of when standing quadrupedally, and up to a height of bipedally.

Coprolites (fossilized droppings) of some Late Cretaceous hadrosaurs show that the animals sometimes deliberately ate rotting wood. Wood itself is not nutritious, but decomposing wood would have contained fungi, decomposed wood material and detritus-eating invertebrates, all of which would have been nutritious. Examination of hadrosaur coprolites from the Grand Staircase-Escalante indicates that shellfish such as crustaceans were also an important component of the hadrosaur diet.

It&#x27;s thought that chewing behaviour may have changed throughout life in hadrosaurids. Very young specimens show simple cup shapes occlusion zones, or areas where the teeth contact one another in chewing, whereas in adulthood there is a &quot;dual function&quot; arrangement with two distinct areas of different tooth wear. This change during growth may have helped transition from a diet of softer plants when young to more tough and fibrous ones during adulthood. It&#x27;s thought the transition between states, characterized by a more gradual transition from one wear state to another, occurred at different times in the growth of different species; in &quot;Hypacrosaurus stebingeri&quot; it did not occur until a nearly adult stage, whereas in a saurolophine specimen likely less than a year old from the Dinosaur Park Formation the transition had already begun.

===Neurology===

Hadrosaurs have been noted as having the most complex brains among ornithopods, and indeed among ornithischian dinosaurs as a whole. The brains of hadrosaurid dinosaurs have been studied as far back at the late 19th century, when Othniel Charles Marsh made an endocast of a specimen then referred to &quot;Claosaurus annectens&quot;; only basic remarks were possible but it was noted that the organ was proportionally small. John Ostrom would give a more informed analysis and review in 1961, pulling on data from &quot;Edmontosaurus regalis&quot;, &quot;E. annectens&quot;, and &quot;Gryposaurus notabilis&quot; (then considered a synonym of &quot;Kritosaurus&quot;). Though still obviously small, Ostrom recognized that the brains may be more significantly developed than expected, but supported the view that dinosaur brains would have only filled some of the endocranial cavity, limiting possibility of analysis. In 1977 James Hopson introduced the use of estimated encephalization quotients to the topic of dinosaur intelligence, finding &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; to have an EQ of 1.5, above that of other ornithischians including earlier relatives like &quot;Camptosaurus&quot; and &quot;Iguanodon&quot; and similar to that of carnosaurian theropods and modern crocodilians but below that of coelurosaurian theropods. Reasonings suggested for their comparably high intelligence were the need for acute senses in the lack of defensive weapons, and more complex intraspecific behaviours as indicated by their acoustic and visual display structures.

The advent of CT scanning for use in palaeontology has allowed for more widespread application of this without the need for specimen destruction. Modern research using these methods has focused largely on hadrosaurs. In a 2009 study by palaeontologist David C. Evans and colleagues, the brains of lambeosaurine hadrosaur genera &quot;Hypacrosaurus&quot; (adult specimen ROM 702), &quot;Corythosaurus&quot; (juvenile specimen ROM 759 and subadult specimen CMN 34825), and &quot;Lambeosaurus&quot; (juvenile specimen ROM 758) were scanned and compared to each other (on a phylogenetic and ontogenetic level), related taxa, and previous predictions, the first such large-scale look into the neurology of the subfamily. Contra the early works, Evans&#x27; studies indicate that only some regions of the hadrosaur brain (the dorsal portion and much of the hindbrain) were loosely correlated to the brain wall, like modern reptiles, with the ventral and lateral regions correlating fairly closely. Also unlike modern reptiles, the brains of the juveniles did not seem to correlate any closer to the brain wall than those of adults. It was cautioned, however, that very young individuals were not included in the study.

As with previous studies, EQ values were investigated, although a wider number range was given to account for uncertainty in brain and body mass. The range for the adult &quot;Hypacrosaurus&quot; was 2.3 to 3.7; the lowest end of this range was still higher than modern reptiles and most non-maniraptoran dinosaurs (nearly all having EQs below two), but fell well short of maniraptorans themselves, which had quotients higher than four. The size of the cerebral hemispheres was, for the first time, remarked upon. It was found to taking up around 43% of endocranial volume (not considering olfactory bulbs) in ROM 702. This is comparable to their size in saurolophine hadrosaurs, but far larger than in any ornithischians outside of Hadrosauriformes, and all large saurischian dinosaurs; maniraptors &quot;Conchoraptor&quot; and &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, an early bird, had very similar proportions. This lends further support to the idea of complex behaviours and relatively high intelligence, for non-avian dinosaurs, in hadrosaurids.

&quot;Amurosaurus&quot;, a close relative of the taxa from the 2009 study, was the subject of a 2013 paper once again looking into a cranial endocast. A nearly identical EQ range of 2.3 to 3.8 was found, and it was again noted this was higher than that of living reptiles, sauropods and other ornithischians, but different EQ estimates for theropods were cited, placing the hadrosaur numbers significantly below even more basal theropods like &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot; (with an EQ range of 3.31 to 5.07) and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; (with a range of 2.4 to 5.24, compared to only 1.6 in the 2009 study); more bird-like coelurosaurians theropods such as &quot;Troodon&quot; had stated EQs higher than seven. Additionally, the relative cerebral volume was only 30% in &quot;Amurosaurus&quot;, significantly lower than in &quot;Hypacrosaurus&quot;, closer to that of theropods like &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; (with 33%), though still distinctly larger than previously estimated numbers for more primitive iguanodonts like &quot;Lurdusaurus&quot; and &quot;Iguanodon&quot; (both at 19%). This demonstrated a previously unrecognized level of variation in neuro-anatomy within Hadrosauridae.

===Reproduction===

Neonate sized hadrosaur fossils have been documented in the scientific literature. Tiny hadrosaur footprints have been discovered in the Blackhawk Formation of Utah.

In a 2001 review of hadrosaur eggshell and hatchling material from Alberta&#x27;s Dinosaur Park Formation, Darren Tanke and M. K. Brett-Surman concluded that hadrosaurs nested in both the ancient upland and lowlands of the formation&#x27;s depositional environment. The upland nesting grounds may have been preferred by the less common hadrosaurs, like &quot;Brachylophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Parasaurolophus&quot;. However, the authors were unable to determine what specific factors shaped nesting ground choice in the formation&#x27;s hadrosaurs. They suggested that behavior, diet, soil condition, and competition between dinosaur species all potentially influenced where hadrosaurs nested.

Sub-centimeter fragments of pebbly-textured hadrosaur eggshell have been reported from the Dinosaur Park Formation. This eggshell is similar to the hadrosaur eggshell of Devil&#x27;s Coulee in southern Alberta as well as that of the Two Medicine and Judith River Formations in Montana, United States. While present, dinosaur eggshell is very rare in the Dinosaur Park Formation and is only found in two different microfossil sites. These sites are distinguished by large numbers of pisidiid clams and other less common shelled invertebrates, like unionid clams and snails. This association is not a coincidence, as the invertebrate shells would have slowly dissolved and released enough basic calcium carbonate to protect the eggshells from naturally occurring acids that otherwise would have dissolved them and prevented fossilization.

In contrast with eggshell fossils, the remains of very young hadrosaurs are somewhat common. Tanke has observed that an experienced collector could discover multiple juvenile hadrosaur specimens in a single day. The most common remains of young hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation are dentaries, bones from limbs and feet, as well as vertebral centra. The material showed little or none of the abrasion that would have resulted from transport, meaning the fossils were buried near their point of origin. Bonebeds 23, 28, 47, and 50 are productive sources of young hadrosaur remains in the formation, especially bonebed 50. The bones of juvenile hadrosaurs and fossil eggshell fragments are not known to have been preserved in association with each other, despite both being present in the formation.

===Growth and development===

The limbs of the juvenile hadrosaurs are anatomically and proportionally similar to those of adult animals. However, the joints often show &quot;predepositional erosion or concave articular surfaces&quot;, which was probably due to the cartilaginous cap covering the ends of the bones. The pelvis of a young hadrosaur was similar to that of an older individual.

Evidence suggests that young hadrosaurs would have walked on only their two hind legs, while adults would have walked on all four. As the animal aged, the front limbs became more robust in order to take on weight, while the back legs became less robust as they transitioned to walking on all four legs. Furthermore, the animals&#x27; front limbs were shorter than their back limbs.

===Daily activity patterns===
Comparisons between the scleral rings of several hadrosaur genera (&quot;Corythosaurus&quot;, &quot;Prosaurolophus&quot;, and &quot;Saurolophus&quot;) and modern birds and reptiles suggest that they may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.

===Pathology=== 
Spondyloarthropathy has been documented in the spine of a 78-million year old hadrosaurid. Other examples of pathologies in hadrosaurs include healed wounds from predators, such as those found in &quot;Edmontosaurus annectens&quot;, and tumors such as Langerhans cell histiocytosis, hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastomas, found in genera such as &quot;Brachylophosaurus&quot; and &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot;. Osteochondrosis is also commonly found in hadrosaurs.

<text>Barapasaurus ( ) is a genus of basal sauropod dinosaur from Jurassic rocks of India. The only species is &quot;B. tagorei&quot;. &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; comes from the lower part of the Kota Formation, which is of Early to Middle Jurassic age. It is therefore one of the earliest known sauropods. &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; is known from approximately 300 bones from at least six individuals, so that the skeleton is almost completely known except for the anterior cervical vertebrae and the skull. This makes &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; one of the most completely known sauropods from the early Jurassic.

== Discovery and naming ==
All known fossils come from a single locality in the vicinity of the village of Pochampally Pin Code: 442504, bordering Telangana (Pochampally Sironcha Taluka, Gadchiroli District, Vidarbha, Maharastra, in central India). The first bones were discovered in 1958, but most specimens were unearthed in 1960 and 1961. In 1975, the finds were described scientifically by palaeontologist Sohan Lal Jain and colleagues. In 2010, a more detailed osteological description was published by Bandyopadhyay and colleagues. The material is archived in the palaeontological collection of the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI), while a majority of the bones are part of a mount at the Geological Museum of the ISI.

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; (&quot;big-legged lizard&quot;) is derived from &quot;bara&quot; meaning &#x27;big&#x27; and &quot;pa&quot; meaning &#x27;leg&#x27; in several Indian languages including Bengali; the Greek word &quot;sauros&quot; means &#x27;lizard&#x27;. This name was used as a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; since a femur measuring over 1.7 m was unearthed at 1961. The specific name &quot;tagorei&quot; means &#x27;Tagore&#x27;s&#x27;, which honours Bengali poet, writer, painter, and musician Rabindranath Tagore. The first year of fieldwork was carried out in the centenary year of Tagore&#x27;s birth.

==Fossil record==

&quot;Barapasaurus tagorei&quot; is known from a large bone bed found in the Lower Kota Formation, containing approximately 300 bones from at least six individuals of various ages. No remains of the skull, other than teeth, have been found. The age of this fossil site is disputed, because no volcanic rocks whose age can be determined by radiometric dating are associated with the Kota Formation and its age can only be estimated by biostratigraphic comparisons to other rock layers, which is made difficult by the lack of reliable index fossils in the formation. The age has generally been interpreted as Early Jurassic, with the Lower Kota Formation in particular dating to the Sinemurian to Pliensbachian, roughly 184–200 million years ago. However, some studies have argued that the Kota Formation dates to the Middle Jurassic or even later.
=== Taphonomy ===
The approximately 300 bones were found together with large trunks of trees scattered over an area of 276 square meters. Although one of the specimens was found partly articulated, most bones were found disarticulated. Because there are six left femora, the total number of individuals is at least six.

Bandyopadhyay and colleagues (2002, 2010) interpret this assemblage as a herd that died due to a catastrophic event, likely a flood. This flood could have unearthed the trees and transported both trees and &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; a distance before they began to decompose. After decomposition progressed, the bones began to disarticulate. The disarticulated skull bones were removed by the water stream because they were light, leaving only the heavy postcranial bones at the site, which would explain why no skull bones were found.

== Description ==

Although a very early and unspecialised sauropod, &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; shows the building plan typical for later, more derived sauropods: the cervical vertebrae were elongated, resulting in a long neck. The trunk was short and holds columnar limbs which indicate an obligate quadrupedal posture. Even the size, which is estimated at approximately 12-14 meters long and 7 tonnes in weight, is comparable with that of later sauropods.

The vertebral column already shows many traits that are typical for later sauropods which allowed them to attain great body sizes, although in later sauropods these traits are much more developed. The central and neural spines show early hints of hollowing as a weight-saving measure. The dorsal vertebrae are stabilised with hyposphene-hypantrum articulations, accessory projections that link the vertebrae with each other. The sacrum is strengthened through an additional fourth sacral vertebra.

From the skull, only three whole teeth and three crowns are known. The largest known tooth is 5.8 cm in height. Like that of later sauropods, the teeth are spoon shaped and show wrinkled enamel. A basal trait is the coarse serration.

== Classification ==
The relationships of this genus within the Sauropoda are debated. When first described in 1975, it was not attributed to one specific group at all, although the presence of many basal, prosauropod-like features was noted. Since 1984, &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; was united with another early sauropod, &quot;Vulcanodon&quot;, in a family called Vulcanodontidae, although this family was declared invalid by Paul Upchurch in 1995 because it was recognised as polyphyletic. Upchurch erected a clade named Eusauropoda that includes all known sauropods except some very basal forms. While &quot;Vulcanodon&quot; was classified outside the Eusauropoda, &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; was classified inside it, which means that &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; is more derived than &quot;Vulcanodon&quot;. Although Upchurch&#x27;s classification was accepted by most palaeontologists, a recent study from Bandyopadhyay and colleagues came to a contrary conclusion: these palaeontologists stated that &quot;Barapasaurus&quot; was in fact more basal than &quot;Vulcanodon&quot; and removed it from Eusauropoda.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Barapasaurus&quot; comes from clay and sandstone that belongs to the lower part of the Kota Formation. Other vertebrates of this part include another early sauropod, &quot;Kotasaurus&quot;, as well as the mammals &quot;Kotatherium&quot;, &quot;Indotherium&quot; and &quot;Indozostrodon&quot;. The upper part of the Kota Formation additionally contained a pterosaur (&quot;Campylognathoides&quot;), a turtle, two rhynchocephalians, a lepidosaur and some mammals.

<text>Boundary Street is a three-lane one-way street in Kowloon, Hong Kong. It runs in an easterly direction from its start at the intersection with Tung Chau Street in the west, and ends at its intersection with Prince Edward Road West in the east, near the former Kai Tak Airport.

==History==
The street previously marked the boundary between the southern part of Kowloon, ceded by the Qing dynasty to Great Britain in 1860 along with Stonecutters Island, and the northern part of Kowloon (New Kowloon) (which remained part of China until it was leased as part of the New Territories to the United Kingdom in 1898 for 99 years under the Second Convention of Peking). After the lease, the boundary was renamed from Boundary Line to Old Frontier Line.

The boundary was marked by a long line of tall bamboo fences, which effectively blocked smuggling between Chinese Kowloon and British Kowloon at that time. The barrier became obsolete when the New Territories joined the colony.

Although the street marks the historical boundary, the road did not come to exist until 1934, more than 30 years after the lease of boundary north. The road was built to accelerate the development of Kowloon Tong and identify the difference in calculation of rates between the boundary north and south.

==Present==
In everyday life, New Kowloon is no longer regarded as part of the New Territories, but as part of the Kowloon urban area (on both sides of Boundary Street), except for statutory and land rent proposes, where the original arrangement has remained in place.

Administratively its portion west of the East Rail line forms part of the boundary between Yau Tsim Mong and Sham Shui Po districts, until the former western coast of the peninsula, from whereupon the boundary follows the streets on the reclamation.

On 1 July 1997, sovereignty of the territories on both sides of Boundary Street was handed over from the United Kingdom to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, along with the rest of Hong Kong.

==Notable places along the street==
* Fa Hui Park
* La Salle Primary School
* Maryknoll Convent School
* Sycamore Street Playground
