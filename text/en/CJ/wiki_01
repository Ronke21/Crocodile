<text>Paul Hamilton (October 16, 1762 – June 30, 1816) was the 3rd United States Secretary of the Navy, from 1809 to 1813.
==Service in the American War of Independence==
Paul Hamilton was born in Saint Paul&#x27;s Parish, South Carolina, on October 16, 1762. He left school at the age of sixteen due to financial problems. During the American War of Independence he served in military roles in the Southern United States, fighting under General Francis Marion. He participated with Colonel William Harden in the capture of Fort Balfour.
==Political career==
Following the war, he was a planter and public figure. Hamilton served South Carolina in many public offices including state Representative (1787), State Senator (1794), Comptroller (1800), and the 42nd Governor (1804).

In 1809, President James Madison selected Hamilton to become the third Secretary of the Navy. His term in office included the first months of the War of 1812, during which time the small United States Navy achieved several remarkable victories over British warships.
Hamilton was a proponent of military preparedness, especially sea fortifications. Although he wanted to strengthen the Navy, he found the Congress hostile and the President indifferent to his ideas. However, he was responsible for the Naval Hospitals Act of 1811. Secretary Hamilton resigned at the end of 1812 and returned to South Carolina, where he died in Beaufort on June 30, 1816.

==Legacy==
Three Navy destroyers have been named in his honor along with and one Liberty ship named . Also bearing his name is the town of Hamilton, Georgia.

<doc id="1078723" wikidata="Q595453" url="?curid=1078723" title="Colostomy">
<text>A colostomy is an opening (stoma) in the large intestine (colon), or the surgical procedure that creates one. The opening is formed by drawing the healthy end of the colon through an incision in the anterior abdominal wall and suturing it into place. This opening, often in conjunction with an attached ostomy system, provides an alternative channel for feces to leave the body. Thus if the natural anus is unavailable for that function (for example, in cases where it has been removed as part of treatment for colorectal cancer or ulcerative colitis), an artificial anus takes over. It may be reversible or irreversible, depending on the circumstances.

== Uses ==
There are many reasons for this procedure. Some common reasons are:
* A part of the colon has been removed, e.g. due to colon cancer requiring a total mesorectal excision, diverticulitis, injury, etc., so that it is no longer possible for feces to exit via the anus.
* A part of the colon has been operated upon and needs to be &#x27;rested&#x27; until it is healed. In this case, the colostomy is often temporary and is usually reversed at a later date, leaving the patient with a small scar in place of the stoma. Children undergoing surgery for extensive pelvic tumors commonly are given a colostomy in preparation for surgery to remove the tumor, followed by reversal of the colostomy.
* Fecal incontinence that is not responsive to other treatments.

== Types ==

Types of colostomy include:
* Loop colostomy: This type of colostomy is usually used in emergencies and is a temporary and large stoma. A loop of the bowel is pulled out onto the abdomen and held in place with an external device. The bowel is then sutured to the abdomen and two openings are created in the one stoma: one for stool and the other for mucus.
* End colostomy: A stoma is created from one end of the bowel. The other portion of the bowel is either removed or sewn shut (Hartmann&#x27;s procedure).
* Double barrel colostomy: The bowel is severed and both ends are brought out onto the abdomen. Only the proximal stoma is functioning. Most often, double-barrel colostomy is a temporary colostomy with two openings into the colon (distal and proximal). The elimination occurs through the proximal stoma.

Colostomy surgery that is planned usually has a higher rate of long-term success than surgery performed in an emergency situation.

=== Duration ===
A colostomy may be temporary; and reversed at a later date; or permanent.

=== Alternatives ===
Colostomy or ileostomy is now rarely performed for rectal cancer, with surgeons usually preferring primary resection and internal anastomosis, e.g. an ileo-anal pouch. In place of an external appliance, an internal ileo-anal pouch is constructed using a portion of the patient&#x27;s lower intestine, to act as a new rectum to replace the removed original.

== Procedure ==
Placement of the stoma on the abdomen can occur at any location along the colon, but the most common placement is on the lower left side near the sigmoid where a majority of colon cancers occur. Other locations include the ascending, transverse, and descending sections of the colon.

==Routine care==

Pouches and the stick-on appliances to which they attach must be changed regularly. Sometimes an odor neutralizer and lubricant is squirted into a new pouch before it is attached. Two types of pouches are available: one disposable and one drainable. Most pouches are opaque and filter out air through a charcoal filter. The recommended practice is to empty such pouches when one-third full. Appliances, in contrast with pouches, are usually replaced every three to seven days except in cases where their seals have broken contact with the skin, when they should be replaced immediately.

Even as long ago as the 1940s, surgeons conducting a review at the Cleveland Clinic (Jones and Kehm, 1946) could summarize the routine care of the permanent colostomy as usually quite satisfactory, stating that after patients recover from the initial worry prompted by the need for a colostomy, most of them learn to manage their colostomy quite well. &quot;These patients come from all walks of life and carry on their daily work as usual. One patient stated that he could see no advantage of the normal anus over a colostomy. While this may be somewhat overstated, it is true that most people with a permanent colostomy can live a useful, happy life.&quot; They found that, just as in anyone else, dietary indiscretion was the usual factor in occasional bowel habit disruption. This historical experience has been borne out, as today the conclusion still stands that most patients can successfully manage a colostomy as part of their activities of daily living.

Jones and Kehm preferred tissue paper as a colostomy cover (held in place with a band or garment) rather than a colostomy bag. They found that irrigation of the colostomy varied with each patient&#x27;s bowel habit but that most patients developed a routine of every-other-day irrigation, whereas a few needed no irrigation.

People with colostomies must wear an ostomy pouching system to collect intestinal waste. Ordinarily, the pouch must be emptied or changed a couple of times a day depending on the frequency of activity; in general the further from the anus (i.e., the further &#x27;up&#x27; the intestinal tract) the ostomy is located the greater the output and more frequent the need to empty or change the pouch.

=== Colostomy and irrigation ===
People with colostomies who have ostomies of the sigmoid colon or descending colon may have the option of irrigation, which allows for the person to not wear a pouch, but rather just a gauze cap over the stoma, and to schedule irrigation for times that are convenient. To irrigate, a catheter is placed inside the stoma, and flushed with water, which allows the feces to come out of the body into an irrigation sleeve. Most colostomates irrigate once a day or every other day, though this depends on the person, their food intake, and their health.

==Complications==
Parastomal hernia (PH) is the most common late complication of stomata through the abdominal wall, occurring in 10-25% of patients, even up to 50% by some estimates. Prolapse of bowel wall through the stoma occasionally happens and can require reoperation to repair.

Clinical pilates-based exercises have been demonstrated to improve patients&#x27; core abdominal strength and to reduce the risk of a hernia worsening.

Other common complications of colostomy are high output, skin irritation, prolapse, retraction, and ischemia.

<doc id="1078724" wikidata="Q3619319" url="?curid=1078724" title="Antonio Bryant">
<text>Antonio Bryant (born March 9, 1981) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Pittsburgh Panthers, earning consensus All-American honors and winning the Fred Biletnikoff Award. Bryant was picked by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 2002 NFL draft, and he also played professionally for the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers and Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the NFL.

==Early life==
Bryant was born in Miami, Florida and graduated from Miami Northwestern High School, where he was a standout high school football player for the Bulls. He was selected as a team captain in three straight years and helped lead his team as a senior to a Class 6A state title and an undefeated record (16–0).

==College career==
Bryant attended the University of Pittsburgh, and played for the Pittsburgh Panthers football team from 1999 to 2001. He was a first-team All-Big East selection in 2000 and 2001, and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American as a sophomore in 2000. He also won the Fred Biletnikoff Award as the season&#x27;s outstanding college football receiver in 2000; he was the second sophomore to win the award (after Randy Moss). He declared for the NFL Draft after his junior year, leaving as the conference&#x27;s record holder for regular-season touchdowns (26) and 100-yard receiving games (13).

==Professional career==
===Dallas Cowboys===
Bryant was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round (63rd overall) of the 2002 NFL draft, after dropping because of character concerns. He was given number 88 with the expectation of developing into a great player and was the first rookie wide receiver to start in a season opener since Michael Irvin. At the time, his 44 receptions ranked third, his 733 receiving yards ranked fourth and his 6 touchdown receptions ranked second all-time for a Cowboys rookie in a season. On October 13, he had his signature moment against the Carolina Panthers on a 4th and 14, last minute game-winning acrobatic touchdown reception from quarterback Quincy Carter.

In 2003, he was moved to third receiver after Terry Glenn was signed as a free agent.

In 2004, the arrival of free agent Keyshawn Johnson started to affect his attitude. During a mini-camp practice after being unsatisfied with the number of reps he had, he started cursing and threw his jersey aiming at Bill Parcells head, before the team broke up the fight. Although Parcells gave him a second chance, tensions kept escalating from that point forward. He was eventually traded to the Cleveland Browns after the fifth game of the season, in exchange for wide receiver Quincy Morgan, who also had issues with his team.

===Cleveland Browns===
In 2005, he had his best season up to that point, leading the team in catches (69), receiving yards (1,009 yards) and touchdowns (four). He became a free agent at the end of the year.

===San Francisco 49ers===
Bryant signed as a free agent with the San Francisco 49ers in 2006. On December 22, 2006, he was suspended four games for violating the NFL&#x27;s substance abuse policy. On March 1, 2007, he was released one year after he signed a four-year, $14 million contract.

===Free agency===
On September 17, 2007, Bryant was reinstated by the league, but was not able to sign with a team, partly because of a failed drug test over the summer. In October, he filed a lawsuit against the NFL to try to get them to stop drug testing him since he was not a player at the time, and to drop the failed drug test. In December, the case was resolved without the details being released.

===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
After not playing the previous year, on March 10, 2008, Bryant signed a deal for the veteran minimum with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He had a career game against the Carolina Panthers, finishing with 9 receptions for 200 yards, including a one-handed touchdown catch dubbed &quot;catch of the year&quot;. Despite his performance, the Buccaneers lost 38–23. Bryant finished his best season as a pro with 83 catches for 1,248 yards and 7 touchdowns while averaging 15 yards per catch. He became the team&#x27;s leading receiver and the second player in franchise history to record three or more consecutive 100-yard receiving games. On February 18, 2009, he was given the franchise tag by the Buccaneers. On February 25, 2010, he was waived after a somewhat disappointing and injury-plagued season.

===Cincinnati Bengals===
After finishing an injury-plagued season and coming off surgery to repair cartilage damage in his left knee, the Cincinnati Bengals signed Bryant on March 10, 2010, to a four-year contract worth a reported $28 million, along with multiple incentives.

After the Bengals signed Terrell Owens, Bryant gave up his No. 81 jersey for Owens, who had worn the number his entire career. In return for the number, Bryant requested Owens make a donation to his charity and wore jersey No. 19 instead. After struggling in practices and not being able to play in any of the pre-season games because of problems with his left knee, the Bengals released him on August 29.

===Seattle Seahawks===
On June 12, 2012, Bryant worked out for the Seattle Seahawks by attending their three-day mini-camp and took a physical for the team as well. On June 15, 2012, it was reported that he finished all three of the minicamp practices, indicating that his chronic knee injury had healed. After being out of football for two years, Bryant signed with the Seahawks on July 26. His stay with the team was short lived, as he was released on August 5.

<text>The  (; ; abbr. BAnQ) is a Quebec government agency which manages the province&#x27;s legal deposit system, national archives, and national library. Located at the Grande Bibliothèque in Montreal, the BAnQ was created by the merging of the Bibliothèque nationale du Québec and the Archives nationales du Québec in 2006. The Bibliothèque nationale du Québec had previously merged with the Grande Bibliothèque du Québec in 2002.

==History==
The National Archives of Quebec (, ANQ) were founded on 2 September 1920, with Pierre-Georges Roy as Quebec&#x27;s first Head Archivist. The purpose of the institution was to process historical materials, more specifically public archives and the Quebec government&#x27;s archives, and to collect documents pertaining to the history of Quebec. the ANQ were brought under the jurisdiction of the Department of Cultural Affairs in 1961, and renamed the Archives de la province de Québec in 1963.

On 12 August 1967, the National Assembly of Quebec legislated to establish the National Library of Quebec (, BNQ), an institution that would also come under the Department of Cultural Affairs. The BNQ held the collections and furniture of the Bibliothèque Saint-Sulpice, founded by the Sulpician Order in 1915 and managed by the Government of Quebec since 1941.

In 1968, the provincial regulation on legal deposit came into effect requiring that Quebec publishers deposit with the BNQ two copies of their printed works, including books, brochures, newspapers, magazines and journals, artists&#x27; books and musical scores. In 1992, a regulation of the National Assembly expanded legal deposit to original prints, posters, art work reproductions, postcards, sound recordings (microgroove vinyl records, compact discs, and more), software, electronic documents, and desktop publishing.

In 1997, the idea of creating a Grande Bibliothèque was born out of the desire to provide widespread availability to the materials of the BNQ and of the Montreal Public Libraries Network. The institution founded to create a major public library, called the Grande bibliothèque du Québec (GBQ), was merged with the BNQ in 2002. The new entity pursued the acquisition, preservation and promotion of the national collection, and the acquisition and promotion of the circulating collection for the general public. The construction work of the Grande Bibliothèque took place from 2001 to 2004 in downtown Montreal, and the collections of the Montreal Library, the circulating collections of the BNQ and the new acquisitions were placed on the shelves of the Grande Bibliothèque in Fall 2004. The Grande Bibliothèque was formally inaugurated on 29 April 2005, and it began its operations on 3 May 2005. 

On 31 January 2006, the Bibliothèque nationale du Québec and the Archives nationales du Québec merged to become the .

Following a data breach in 2021 of a related provider, several of BAnQ&#x27;s online offerings were taken offline.

== Collection ==

The library&#x27;s collection includes legal deposit copies of all works printed in Quebec, concerning Quebec, or written or contributed to by an author from Quebec.

==Facilities==
BAnQ carries out its mandate in twelve facilities which are open to the public: the Grande Bibliothèque, BAnQ Vieux-Montréal and BAnQ Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie in Montreal; BAnQ Gaspé, BAnQ Gatineau, BAnQ Québec, BAnQ Rimouski, BAnQ Rouyn-Noranda, BAnQ Saguenay, BAnQ Sept-Îles, BAnQ Sherbrooke and BAnQ Trois-Rivières.

Located in the &quot;Quartier Latin&quot;, in the heart of Montreal, the Grande Bibliothèque is the flagship library facility of the . This major public library was specifically designed to encourage the discovery and exploration of BAnQ&#x27;s collections with free and open access. Materials from the universal collection are available for circulation while rarer documents such as most of the legal deposit collection can be consulted on site. The building, each of its six levels fostering a different atmosphere, opened to the public in 2005. Its patrons include scholars and the general public alike. It welcomes close to 50,000 visitors each week.

==Mission==
The mission of is to gather, permanently preserve and promote Quebec&#x27;s published heritage materials, any Quebec-related material of cultural interest, and any Quebec-related material published outside Quebec. It aims to provide democratic access to the heritage material constituted by its collections, to culture and universal knowledge, and to act, in this respect, as a catalyst for the library and information institutions of Quebec, thus contributing to the fulfillment of its citizens.

BAnQ also aims to provide structure, support and advise public bodies regarding the management of their materials, ensure the preservation of public archives, make them more accessible and boost their visibility. The institution is also responsible for promoting the preservation and accessibility of private archives. To this end, BAnQ carries out the responsibilities provided under the Archives Act. In the archival field, the institution can also provide research support services and contribute to the development and international outreach of Quebec heritage materials and expertise.

BAnQ serves as the official representative of the Agence francophone pour la numérotation internationale du livre regarding the assignment of ISBN prefixes in Quebec and Canada.

===National library===
BAnQ is responsible for acquiring, processing, preserving and highlighting the heritage collections. These collections bring together the entire production of printed materials in Quebec, mostly through legal deposit, and of Quebec-related materials. The Preservation Branch (Direction générale de la conservation) which handles this aspect of the institution&#x27;s mission, operates out of BAnQ Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, in Montreal. Designed to ensure the long-term preservation of the materials stored there, the facility also houses BAnQ&#x27;s head office. Patrons can access the heritage collections&#x27; materials in the reading room of the Collection nationale, located in the Grande Bibliothèque. The special collections, however, can be viewed on site at BAnQ Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie.

===National archives===
 carries out its activities in the archival field through 10 regional facilities: BAnQ Vieux-Montréal, BAnQ Québec, BAnQ Gaspé, BAnQ Gatineau, BAnQ Rimouski, BAnQ Saguenay, BAnQ Sherbrooke, BAnQ Trois-Rivières, BAnQ Rouyn-Noranda and BAnQ Sept-Îles.

The Montreal facility is housed in the Gilles Hocquart Building, formerly the HEC Montréal building, on Avenue Viger. The Quebec City facility is located in the Louis-Jacques-Casault pavilion on the Université Laval campus.

=== Digitized collection ===

BAnQ operates a web portal, BAnQ numérique, to distribute its digitized collections of books and newspapers.

<text>Robert Henry FRSE FSA (Scot) (18 February 1718 – 24 November 1790) was a Scottish minister and historian.

==Life==

He was born on 18 February 1718, the son of Jean Galloway and James Henry, a farmer at Muirton Farm near St. Ninians, Stirlingshire.

Henry was educated at St Ninian&#x27;s Parish School then Stirling Grammar School. He then studied at the University of Edinburgh. After teaching at Annan Grammar School, he entered the Church of Scotland, being licensed by the Presbytery of Annan in 1746, but not finding a patron. He was finally ordained in 1748, just over the Scottish border in Carlisle, and translated in 1760 to Berwick-upon-Tweed, still just over the Scottish border (the rules on patronage were different in England).

In May 1768 he finally got a position in Scotland: as minister at New Greyfriars in Edinburgh. The University of Edinburgh granted him an honorary doctorate (DD) in July 1770. At this time he lived at Bristo Street, just south of Greyfriars Church.

He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1774.

In 1776 he moved from New Greyfriars to Old Kirk, St Giles and remained in this role until death.

In 1783 he was one of the co-founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

He died on 24 November 1790 at his home in Merchant Street in Edinburgh (just south of St Giles) but is buried with his family in Polmont churchyard. His position at St Giles was filled by Henry Grieve. He bequeathed his library to the Town Council of Linlithgow but his link to this town is unclear.

==Family==

In June 1763 he was married to Anne Balderston (d. 1800).

==Works==
He wrote a &quot;History of Great Britain on a New Plan&quot; (1771), covering the period from the first Roman invasion until the reign of King Henry VIII. The novelty consisted in dividing the subjects into different heads, civil history, military, social, and so on, and following out each of them separately. The work was mainly a compilation, having no critical qualities. Despite the persistent and ferocious attacks of Dr Gilbert Stewart, it was successful, and brought the author over £3000. It attracted the support of the Earl of Mansfield, whose persuasion gained for Henry a government pension of £100. The work was posthumously concluded by Malcolm Laing.

<text>John Abraham Heraud (1799–1887) was an English journalist and poet. He published two extravagant epic poems, &quot;The Descent into Hell&quot; (1830), and &quot;The Judgment of the Flood&quot; (1834). He also wrote plays and travel books.
== Life ==
He was born in the parish of St Andrew&#x27;s, Holborn, London, on 5 July 1799. His father, James Abraham Heraud, of Huguenot descent, was a law stationer, and died at Tottenham, Middlesex, on 6 May 1846, having married Jane, daughter of John and Elizabeth Hicks; she died 2 August 1850. John Abraham, the son, was privately educated, and originally destined for business, but in 1818 began writing for the magazines.

Heraud had a large circle of literary acquaintances, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth, and John Gibson Lockhart. Southey was a correspondent, who thought Heraud capable of learning anything, except &quot;how to check his own exuberance in verse&quot;, as he wrote to Robert Gooch.

Heraud wrote for the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; and other reviews, and from 1830 to 1833 assisted in editing &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. There he was sub-editor to William Maginn, taking on literary criticism and philosophy. At this period he was still in partnership with his father, in legal stationery. The partnership was dissolved in 1841, when he went into the trade on his own in the Chancery Lane area, but unsuccessfully.

With the Carlyles Heraud was very close. Thomas Carlyle was well aware of Heraud assiduously cultivating favour, and of James Fraser&#x27;s opinion that Heraud was &quot;mad as a March hare&quot;, writing to Jane Carlyle about him in 1834.

Heraud edited &quot;The Sunbeam. A Journal devoted to Polite Literature&quot;, in 1838 and 1839; the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; from 1839 to 1842; and subsequently the &quot;Christian&#x27;s Monthly Magazine&quot;. In 1843 he became a contributor to &quot;The Athenæum&quot;, and later served as its dramatic critic until his retirement in 1868. From 1849 to 1879 he was also the dramatic critic of the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;. In 1869 he used that position to call for censorship of &quot;Formosa&quot;, Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;courtesan play&quot;, prompting William Bodham Donne of the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office to tighten up licensing of drama with sexual overtones.

In the late 1840s friends were trying to sort out Heraud&#x27;s financial problems, amounting to insolvency; a fund-raising committee was formed, with officers John Forster, Thomas Kibble Hervey and John Westland Marston. On 21 July 1873, on the nomination of William Gladstone, he was appointed a brother of the London Charterhouse, where he died on 20 April 1887. He was buried in Islington Cemetery on 23 April 1887.

== The Syncretics ==
Heraud was identified as a leading figure in the &quot;Syncretics&quot;, a proto-aesthetic group mocked in &quot;Punch&quot; and prominent around 1840. After a few years the excitement around their eclectic approach subsided. A biographer of Ralph Waldo Emerson, who initially took a great interest, has called Heraud in particular a &quot;general failure&quot;.

=== The group ===
Other Syncretics were Francis Foster Barham, Richard Henry Horne, and John Westland Marston. Barham and Heraud founded the Syncretic Society, or Syncretic Association. It grew out of an earlier group round James Pierrepont Greaves, the &quot;Aesthetic Society&quot; or &quot;Aesthetic Institution&quot;, based in Burton Street on the north side of Bloomsbury, with a core of Greaves and a few neighbours. Heraud and Barham took over the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot;, and it functioned as the organ of the group in the period 1839 to 1841. Camilla Toulmin gained the impression in 1841, visiting Horne, that there was a group of younger and ambitious men in the Syncretics, besides the better-known names. For example, the Syncretics took up the &quot;Festus&quot; of Philip James Bailey.

=== Transatlantic ties ===
The group also found kinship with, and encouragement from, the New England transcendentalists. Bronson Alcott corresponded with Greaves. He also sent books to Greaves and Heraud; Greaves sent back books including Heraud&#x27;s &quot;Lecture on Poetic Genius&quot;. Approval of the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; was strong from Alcott, Convers Francis and George Ripley. Heraud published one piece from New England in 1839, an oration by Robert Bartlett. It proved a false start, though. Later in the year the transcendentalists founded their own periodical, &quot;The Dial&quot;, along the same lines.

Writing in &quot;The Dial&quot; in 1842, Emerson in his article &quot;English Reformers&quot; praised Heraud as an interpreter of Jakob Boehme and Emanuel Swedenborg; and referenced his papers &quot;Foreign Aids to Self Intelligence&quot;, which had been announced as a three-volume work. Heraud took Emerson to be a disciple of Carlyle, and was contradicted in &quot;The Present&quot;. A few years later he was explaining that Swedenborg was to be taken only as an example and inspiration, since the transcendentalist approach was at odds with an established church. It was through the pages of the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; that two notable Swedenborgians, James John Garth Wilkinson and Henry James Sr., came to know each other.

Carlyle in fact disapproved of the group around Heraud and Alcott House, Greaves&#x27;s project. These included John Goodwyn Barmby, Newton Crosland, Horne, Henry Mansel, and James Elishama Smith.

=== Drama activism ===
A series of public lectures by the Syncretic Association started early in 1841. Bayle Bernard was one of the speakers, and the talks took place in the Suffolk Street Gallery, London. A circumstantial account, &quot;&quot;Damned&quot; Tragedies&quot;, was given in the July 1842 &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. Bernard&#x27;s talk was light-hearted chat about actors, but Heraud and Frederick Guest Tomlins addressed more serious aspects and limitations of current British theatre, before the weekly series outstayed its welcome at the Gallery.

The Syncretics, who included also George Stephens, became active in agitation to have unperformed drama staged. The context was the restriction in London to three theatres with patents, and an absence of new verse drama productions. Not short of ambition, the Dramatic Committee of the Association, through Heraud, pressed for a reformed and poetic theatre, an actors&#x27; joint stock company, and the performance of new work, as well as drama schools to elevate taste. A failed demonstration, &quot;Martinuzzi&quot; of 1841, written by Stephens, led to Heraud in particular being lampooned in &quot;Punch&quot;, by William Makepeace Thackeray. The existing theatrical monopoly was, however, abolished by the Theatres Act 1843.

Heraud himself wrote dramas and persisted. The tragedy of &quot;Videna&quot;, based on Geoffrey of Monmouth, was acted at the Marylebone Theatre in 1854, with James William Wallack; and &quot;Wife or No Wife&quot; and a version of Ernest Legouvé&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot; were staged later.

== Heraud as poet ==
&quot;Harper&#x27;s Cyclopædia of British and American poetry&quot; noted that as a poet, Heraud had been snubbed by the critics, &quot;and not always unjustly&quot;. It also repeated the story attributed to Douglas Jerrold, asked by Heraud whether he had seen &quot;his &quot;Descent into Hell&quot;&quot;, and replying that he&#x27;d like to. Heraud made two attempts at epic grandeur in his poems &quot;The Descent into Hell&quot;, 1830, and &quot;The Judgment of the Flood&quot;, 1834. The view of &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Cyclopædia of English Literature&quot; was that he attempted in poetry what John Martin did in art: the vast, the remote, and the terrible. It found his &quot;Descent&quot; and &quot;Judgment&quot; to be &quot;psychological curiosities&quot; of &quot;misplaced power&quot;. George Saintsbury put Heraud on a level with Edwin Atherstone, and above Robert Pollok. Herbert Tucker regards the &quot;Judgement of the Flood&quot; as &quot;deranged&quot;, but has more time for the &quot;Descent into Hell&quot;. He places it with other, earlier attempts to dramatise Christian typology, such as those of William Gilbank and Elizabeth Smith of Birmingham. He notes Heraud&#x27;s familiarity with Coleridge&#x27;s apologetics, and his reference to Martin in the annotations.

Heraud later wrote a political epic, which remained unpublished. This work was under the influence of William James Linton.

<doc id="1078745" wikidata="Q1283501" url="?curid=1078745" title="Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Thomas Herbert, 1st Baronet (1606–1682), was an English traveller, historian and a gentleman of the bedchamber of King Charles I while Charles was in the custody of Parliament (from 1647 until the king&#x27;s execution in January 1649).

==Biography==
Herbert was born to a Yorkshire family. His birthplace, a timber-framed structure, still stands in York and is known as the Herbert House. Several of Herbert&#x27;s ancestors were aldermen and merchants in that area – such as his grandfather and benefactor, Alderman Herbert (d. 1614) – and they traced a connection with the Earls of Pembroke. After attending St Peter&#x27;s School, York and Tonbridge School, he is said to have studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, and Jesus College, Oxford (1621), but afterwards removed to Cambridge, through the influence of his uncle Dr Ambrose Akroyd.

In 1627 William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, procured his appointment in the suite of Sir Dodmore Cotton, then starting as ambassador for Persia with Sir Robert Shirley. Sailing in March they visited the Cape, Madagascar, Goa and Surat; landing at Gambrun on the Persian coast (10 January 1628), they travelled inland to Ashraf and thence to Qazvin, where both Cotton and Shirley died, and whence Herbert made extensive travels in the Persian hinterland, visiting Kashan, Baghdad and Amol. On his return voyage Herbert touched at Ceylon, the Coromandel coast, Mauritius and St Helena. He reached England in 1629, travelled in Europe in 1630–1631, married in 1632 and retired from court in 1634 (his prospects perhaps blighted by Pembroke&#x27;s death in 1630); after this he resided on his Tintern estate and elsewhere until the English Civil War, when he sided with Parliament. He later published an account of his travels.

He was gentleman of the bedchamber to King Charles I from 1647 up to the king&#x27;s execution. During the first civil war he was a keen supporter of Parliament, and when he was in the king&#x27;s service the New Model Army found no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.

There is varied opinion on the matter of Herbert&#x27;s devotion to King Charles. In 1678 he published &quot;Threnodia Carolina&quot;, an account of the last two years of the king&#x27;s life. In this account Herbert seems devoted in the extreme, being too distraught to be with the king on the scaffold and bursting into tears when the king seemed upset by some news he had brought. It is true that many of the staunch Roundheads Parliament appointed to the king&#x27;s service were converted into royalists on getting to know him. However &quot;Threnodia Carolina&quot; may have been an attempt to give Herbert a good name in Charles II&#x27;s government (the king made him a baronet) and to clear the name of his son-in-law Robert Phayre, who was a regicide.

After the execution Herbert followed the New Model Army to Ireland arriving that summer to take up a position as a parliamentary commissioner. He was to remain in Ireland during the following decade serving in various governmental offices. In December 1653 he was appointed secretary to the Governing Commission for Ireland, which was redesigned in the August 1654 the Governing Council of Ireland. He served as its Clerk until 1659. Henry Cromwell knighted him for his services in July 1658. At the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 Herbert returned to London to take advantage of the offer of a general pardon. On 3 July 1660, shortly after his arrival in England, he had an audience with King Charles II who created him a baronet (his previous Cromwellian knighthood having passed into oblivion at the restoration). After this Herbert dropped out of public life, but initially he remained in London residing in York Street, Westminster, until the Great Plague in 1666, when he retired to York, where he died (at Petergate House) on 1 March 1682, and was buried in the church of St. Crux in that city, where his widow placed a brass tablet to his memory.

==Works==

Herbert&#x27;s chief work is the &quot;Description of the Persian Monarchy now beinge&#x27; the Orientall Indyes, Iles and other ports of the Greater Asia and Africk&quot; (1634), reissued with additions, &amp;c., in 1638 as &quot;Some Yeares Travels into Africa and Asia the Great&quot; (al. &quot;into divers parts of Asia and Afrigue&quot;), a third edition followed in 1664, and a fourth in 1677. This is one of the best records of 17th-century travel. Among its illustrations are remarkable sketches of the dodo, cuneiform inscriptions and Persepolis.

Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Threnodia Carolina; or, Memoirs of the two last years of the reign of that unparallell&#x27;d prince of ever blessed memory King Charles I.&quot;, was in great part printed at the author&#x27;s request in Wood&#x27;s &quot;Athenae Oxonienses&quot;, in full by Dr C Goodall in his &quot;Collection of Tracts&quot; (1702, repr. G. &amp; W. Nicol, 1813).

Sir William Dugdale is understood to have received assistance from Herbert in the &quot;Monasticon Anglicanum&quot;, vol. iv.; see two of Herbert&#x27;s papers on St John&#x27;s, Beverley and Ripon collegiate church, now cathedral, in Drake&#x27;s &quot;Eboracum&quot; (appendix). Cf. also Robert Davies account of Herbert in &quot;The Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Journal&quot;, part ni., pp. 182–214 (1870), containing a facsimile of the inscription on Herbert&#x27;s tomb; Wood&#x27;s &quot;Athenae&quot;, iv. I5-41; and &quot;Fasti&quot;, 11. 26, 131, 138, 143–144, 150.

==Family==
Herbert married, on 16 April 1632, Lucia, daughter of Sir Walter Alexander, Gentleman Usher to Charles I. She died in 1671. They had four sons and six daughters, but only one son and three daughters survived their father:
* Henry (died 1687), who succeed his father as baronet Herbert of Tintern
* Elizabeth, who married Colonel Robert Phaire of Cork on 16 August 1658
* Lucie
* Anne

Within a year of Lucia&#x27;s death Herbert married Elizabeth (died 1696), daughter of Gervase Cutler, of Stainbrough, Yorkshire and Magdalen Egerton, and niece of the Earl of Bridgewater. They had one child, a daughter, who died in infancy.

<text>David Herd (1732 – 10 June 1810) was a noted Scottish anthologist of songs and ballads.

==Biography==
Herd was born in Balmakelly in the parish of Marykirk in Kincardineshire in 1732 to Margaret Herd (née Low) (1691–1751) and John Herd, a farmer. The child David was baptised on 23 October 1732. Later in life he became clerk to an accountant in Edinburgh, where he became a well-known figure among the literary men. He devoted his leisure to collecting old Scottish poems and songs. In 1769 he published his first compilation of nearly 60 &#x27;heroic ballads&#x27; and 300 songs as &quot;Ancient Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads, etc.&quot; Later enlarged editions appeared in 1776 and 1791.

Herd was a member and Sovereign (president) of the Edinburgh Cape Club, a tavern based convivial society with members including the poet Robert Fergusson, the painters Alexander Nasmyth, Henry Raeburn and Alexander Runciman (a close friend of Herd&#x27;s), as well as John Wotherspoon (the printer of Herd&#x27;s book) and Deacon William Brodie. Herd was also friendly with Sir Walter Scott, who made use of Herd&#x27;s manuscript collections in his collection of ballads, the &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;.

Herd died at Potterrow, Edinburgh on 10 June 1810 and was buried in the Buccleuch Parish Church yard.

<doc id="1078755" wikidata="Q10862179" url="?curid=1078755" title="Great Year">
<text>The term Great Year has more than one major meaning. It is defined by scientific astronomy as &quot;The period of one complete cycle of the equinoxes around the ecliptic, or about 25,800 years&quot;. Ptolemy reported that his teacher Hipparchus, by comparing the position of the vernal equinox against the fixed stars in his time and in earlier observations, discovered that it shifts westward approximately one degree every 72 years. Thus the time it would take the equinox to make a complete revolution through all the zodiac constellations and return to its original position would be approximately 25,920 years. In the heliocentric model, the precession can be pictured as the axis of the Earth&#x27;s rotation making a slow revolution around the normal to the plane of the ecliptic. The position of the Earth&#x27;s axis in the northern night sky currently almost aligns with the star Polaris, the North Star. But as the direction of the axis is changing, this is a passing coincidence which was not always so and will not be so again until a Great Year has passed.

The Platonic Year, which is also called the Great Year, has a different more ancient and mystical meaning. Plato hypothesized that winding the orbital motions of the Sun, Moon and naked eye planets forward or back in time would arrive at a point where they are in the same positions as they are today. He called this time period the Great Year and suggested that such a unified return would take place about every 36,000 years.

By extension, the term &quot;Great Year&quot; can be used for any concept of eternal return in the world&#x27;s mythologies or philosophies. Historian Otto Neugebauer writes: 

== Description of the science ==
The plane of the ecliptic is the plane described by the apparent motion of the Sun against the starry background. It is the Earth&#x27;s orbital motion about the Sun which causes this apparent motion to occur. The Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation is not set perpendicular to this plane but at a present angle of 23.5 degrees to the perpendicular. The alignment of the axis is maintained throughout the year so that the point of sky above the north or south poles remains unchanged throughout the Earth&#x27;s annual rotation around the Sun.

A slow conical motion of the Earth&#x27;s polar axis about its normal to the plane of the ecliptic is caused by the attractive force of the other heavenly bodies on the equatorial protuberance of the Earth. A similar conical motion can also be observed in a gyroscope that is subjected to lateral forces.

The resultant motion of the Earth&#x27;s axis is called general precession and the equinox points in the ecliptic move westward along the ecliptic at the rate of about 50.3 seconds of arc per year as a result. In 25,772 years, the points are once again at the same point in the sky where observations began.

In addition the tilt, or obliquity, of the Earth&#x27;s axis is not constant but changes in a cycle of its own. During a cycle that averages about 40,000 years, the tilt of the axis varies between 22.1 and 24.5 degrees.
==History of both definitions==
Plato (c. 360 BC) used the term &quot;perfect year&quot; to describe the return of the celestial bodies (planets) and the diurnal rotation of the fixed stars (circle of the Same) to their original positions; there is no evidence he had any knowledge of axial precession. The cycle which Plato describes is one of planetary and astral conjunction, which can be postulated without any awareness of axial precession.

Hipparchus (c. 120 BC) is the first Greek credited with discovering axial precession roughly two hundred years after Plato&#x27;s death (see below).

Cicero (1st century BC) followed Plato in defining the Great Year as a combination of solar, lunar and planetary cycles.

Plato&#x27;s description of the perfect year is found in his dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot;: 
In &quot;De Natura Deorum&quot;, Cicero wrote

Macrobius (early fifth century AD) in his commentary on Cicero&#x27;s Somnium Scipionis states that &#x27;the philosophers&#x27; reckon the Great Year as 15,000 years.

Censorinus (3rd century AD) wrote that Aristarchus of Samos reckoned a Great Year as 2484 years: but it has been argued that this is a miscopying of 2434, which represents 45 Exeligmos cycles.

The origin of the Platonic Year would seem to have no connection with the precession of the equinoxes as this was unknown in Plato&#x27;s time. Two centuries after Plato, Hipparchus is credited with discovering the period of equinox precession, and the term &quot;Great Year&quot; eventually came to be applied to the period of that precession caused by the slow gyration of the Earth&#x27;s axis.

It is argued that a confusion between the two originated with the astronomer Ptolemy (c. 170 AD), who &quot;adopted the larger, erroneous, figure, with the result that henceforth the two versions of the Great Year — the Platonic Great Year, defined by the planets, and the precessional, defined by the stars — were to be increasingly confused.&quot;

Ptolemy has even been accused of committing scientific fraud by making up observations that would give the figure of 36,000 years even though the data available to him were good enough to get very near the true figure of 26,000.

Josephus (first century AD) refers to a &#x27;Great Year&#x27; () of 600 years.

It has been suggested that he obtained this value from Berossos (c. 3rd century BC) who reckoned time in intervals of 60, 600 and 3600 years.

Isaac Newton (1642 – 1726/27) determined the cause of precession and established the rate of precession at 1 degree per 72 years, very close to the best value measured today, thus demonstrating the magnitude of the error in the earlier value of 1 degree per century.

<doc id="1078762" wikidata="Q424607" url="?curid=1078762" title="Morpholino">
<text>A Morpholino, also known as a Morpholino oligomer and as a phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomer (PMO), is a type of oligomer molecule (colloquially, an oligo) used in molecular biology to modify gene expression. Its molecular structure contains DNA bases attached to a backbone of methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups. Morpholinos block access of other molecules to small (~25 base) specific sequences of the base-pairing surfaces of ribonucleic acid (RNA). Morpholinos are used as research tools for reverse genetics by knocking down gene function.

This article discusses only the Morpholino antisense oligomers, which are nucleic acid analogs. The word &quot;Morpholino&quot; can occur in other chemical names, referring to chemicals containing a six-membered morpholine ring. To help avoid confusion with other morpholine-containing molecules, when describing oligos &quot;Morpholino&quot; is often capitalized as a trade name, but this usage is not consistent across scientific literature. Morpholino oligos are sometimes referred to as PMO (for phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer), especially in medical literature. Vivo-Morpholinos and PPMO are modified forms of Morpholinos with chemical groups covalently attached to facilitate entry into cells.

Gene knockdown is achieved by reducing the expression of a particular gene in a cell. In the case of protein-coding genes, this usually leads to a reduction in the quantity of the corresponding protein in the cell. Knocking down gene expression is a method for learning about the function of a particular protein; in a similar manner, causing a specific exon to be spliced out of the RNA transcript encoding a protein can help to determine the function of the protein moiety encoded by that exon or can sometimes knock down the protein activity altogether. These molecules have been applied to studies in several model organisms, including mice, zebrafish, frogs and sea urchins. Morpholinos can also modify the splicing of pre-mRNA or inhibit the maturation and activity of miRNA. Techniques for targeting Morpholinos to RNAs and delivering Morpholinos into cells have recently been reviewed in a journal article and in book form.

Morpholinos are in development as pharmaceutical therapeutics targeted against pathogenic organisms such as bacteria or viruses and genetic diseases. A Morpholino-based drug eteplirsen from Sarepta Therapeutics received accelerated approval from the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2016 for the treatment of some mutations causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy, although the approval process was mired in controversy. Other Morpholino-based drugs golodirsen, viltolarsen, and casimersen (also for Duchenne muscular dystrophy) were approved by the FDA in 2019–2021.

== History ==
Morpholino oligos were conceived by Summerton (Gene Tools) at AntiVirals Inc. (now Sarepta Therapeutics) and originally developed in collaboration with Weller.

== Structure ==
Morpholinos are synthetic molecules that are the product of a redesign of natural nucleic acid structure. Usually 25 bases in length, they bind to complementary sequences of RNA or single-stranded DNA by standard nucleic acid base-pairing. In terms of structure, the difference between Morpholinos and DNA is that, while Morpholinos have standard nucleic acid bases, those bases are bound to methylenemorpholine rings linked through phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphates. The figure compares the structures of the two strands depicted there, one of RNA and the other of a Morpholino. Replacement of anionic phosphates with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate groups eliminates ionization in the usual physiological pH range, so Morpholinos in organisms or cells are uncharged molecules. The entire backbone of a Morpholino is made from these modified subunits.

== Function ==
Morpholinos do not trigger the degradation of their target RNA molecules, unlike many antisense structural types (e.g., phosphorothioates, siRNA). Instead, Morpholinos act by &quot;steric blocking&quot;, binding to a target sequence within an RNA, inhibiting molecules that might otherwise interact with the RNA. Morpholino oligos are often used to investigate the role of a specific mRNA transcript in an embryo. Developmental biologists inject Morpholino oligos into eggs or embryos of zebrafish, African clawed frog (&quot;Xenopus&quot;), sea urchin and killifish (&quot;F. heteroclitus&quot;) producing morphant embryos, or electroporate Morpholinos into chick embryos at later development stages. With appropriate cytosolic delivery systems, Morpholinos are effective in cell culture. Vivo-Morpholinos, in which the oligo is covalently linked to a delivery dendrimer, enter cells when administered systemically in adult animals or in tissue cultures.

===Normal gene expression in eukaryotes===
In eukaryotic organisms, pre-mRNA is transcribed in the nucleus, introns are spliced out, then the mature mRNA is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The small subunit of the ribosome usually starts by binding at the 5&#x27; end of the mRNA and is joined there by various other eukaryotic initiation factors, forming the initiation complex. The initiation complex scans along the mRNA strand until it reaches a start codon, and then the large subunit of the ribosome attaches to the small subunit and translation of a protein begins. This entire process is referred to as gene expression; it is the process by which the information in a gene, encoded as a sequence of bases in DNA, is converted into the structure of a protein. A Morpholino can modify splicing, block translation, or block other functional sites on RNA depending on the Morpholino&#x27;s base sequence.

===Blocking translation===

Bound to the 5&#x27;-untranslated region of messenger RNA (mRNA), Morpholinos can interfere with progression of the ribosomal initiation complex from the 5&#x27; cap to the start codon. This prevents translation of the coding region of the targeted transcript (called &quot;knocking down&quot; gene expression). This is useful experimentally when an investigator wishes to know the function of a particular protein; Morpholinos provide a convenient means of knocking down expression of the protein and learning how that knockdown changes the cells or organism. Some Morpholinos knock down expression so effectively that, after degradation of preexisting proteins, the targeted proteins become undetectable by Western blot.

In 2016 a synthetic peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) was found to inhibit the expression of New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase, an enzyme that many drug-resistant bacteria use to destroy carbapenems.

===Modifying pre-mRNA splicing===

Morpholinos can interfere with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked. Splice modification can be conveniently assayed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and is seen as a band shift after gel electrophoresis of RT-PCR products.

===Other applications: blocking other mRNA sites and use as probes===
Morpholinos have been used to block miRNA activity and maturation. Fluorescein-tagged Morpholinos combined with fluorescein-specific antibodies can be used as probes for in-situ hybridization to miRNAs. Morpholinos can block ribozyme activity. U2 and U12 snRNP functions have been inhibited by Morpholinos. Morpholinos targeted to &quot;slippery&quot; mRNA sequences within protein coding regions can induce translational frameshifts. Morpholinos can block RNA editing, poly(A) tailing and translocation sequences. Morpholino activities against this variety of targets suggest that Morpholinos can be used as a general-purpose tool for blocking interactions of proteins or nucleic acids with mRNA.

==Specificity, stability and non-antisense effects==
Morpholinos have become a standard knockdown tool in animal embryonic systems, which have a broader range of gene expression than adult cells and can be strongly affected by an off-target interaction. Following initial injections into frog or fish embryos at the single-cell or few-cell stages, Morpholino effects can be measured up to five days later, after most of the processes of organogenesis and differentiation are past, with observed phenotypes consistent with target-gene knockdown. Control oligos with irrelevant sequences usually produce no change in embryonic phenotype, evidence of the Morpholino oligo&#x27;s sequence-specificity and lack of non-antisense effects. The dose required for a knockdown can be reduced by coinjection of several Morpholino oligos targeting the same mRNA, which is an effective strategy for reducing or eliminating dose-dependent off-target RNA interactions.

mRNA rescue experiments can sometimes restore the wild-type phenotype to the embryos and provide evidence for the specificity of a Morpholino. In an mRNA rescue, a Morpholino is co-injected with an mRNA that codes for the morphlino&#x27;s protein. However, the rescue mRNA has a modified 5&#x27;-UTR (untranslated region) so that the rescue mRNA contains no target for the Morpholino. The rescue mRNA&#x27;s coding region encodes the protein of interest. Translation of the rescue mRNA replaces production of the protein that was knocked down by the Morpholino. Since the rescue mRNA would not affect phenotypic changes due to the Morpholino&#x27;s off-target gene expression modulation, this return to wild-type phenotype is further evidence of Morpholino specificity. In some cases, ectopic expression of the rescue RNA makes recovery of the wild-type phenotype impossible.

In embryos, Morpholinos can be tested in null mutants to check for unexpected RNA interactions, then used in a wild-type embryo to reveal the acute knockdown phenotype. The knockdown phenotype is often more extreme than the mutant phenotype; in the mutant, effects of losing the null gene can be concealed by genetic compensation.

Because of their completely unnatural backbones, Morpholinos are not recognized by cellular proteins. Nucleases do not degrade Morpholinos, nor are they degraded in serum or in cells.

Up to 18% of Morpholinos appear to induce nontarget-related phenotypes including cell death in the central nervous system and somite tissues of zebrafish embryos. Most of these effects are due to activation of p53-mediated apoptosis and can be suppressed by co-injection of an anti-p53 Morpholino along with the experimental Morpholino. Moreover, the p53-mediated apoptotic effect of a Morpholino knockdown has been phenocopied using another antisense structural type, showing the p53-mediated apoptosis to be a consequence of the loss of the targeted protein and not a consequence of the knockdown oligo type. It appears that these effects are sequence-specific; as in most cases, if a Morpholino is associated with non-target effects, the 4-base mismatch Morpholino will not trigger these effects.

A cause for concern in the use of Morpholinos is the potential for &quot;off-target&quot; effects. Whether an observed morphant phenotype is due to the intended knockdown or an interaction with an off-target RNA can often be addressed in embryos by running another experiment to confirm that the observed morphant phenotype results from the knockdown of the expected target. This can be done by recapitulating the morphant phenotype with a second, non-overlapping Morpholino targeting the same mRNA, by confirmation of the observed phenotypes by comparing with a mutant strain (though compensation will obscure a phenotype in some mutants), by testing the Morpholino in a null mutant background to detect additional phenotypic changes or by dominant-negative methods. As mentioned above, rescue of observed phenotypes by coinjecting a rescue mRNA is, when feasible, a reliable test of specificity of a Morpholino.

==Delivery==
For a Morpholino to be effective, it must be delivered past the cell membrane into the cytosol of a cell. Once in the cytosol, Morpholinos freely diffuse between the cytosol and nucleus, as demonstrated by the nuclear splice-modifying activity of Morpholinos observed after microinjection into the cytosol of cells. Different methods are used for delivery into embryos, into cultured cells or into adult animals. A microinjection apparatus is usually used for delivery into an embryo, with injections most commonly performed at the single-cell or few-cell stage; an alternative method for embryonic delivery is electroporation, which can deliver oligos into tissues of later embryonic stages. Common techniques for delivery into cultured cells include the Endo-Porter peptide (which causes the Morpholino to be released from endosomes), the Special Delivery system (no longer commercially available, used a Morpholino-DNA heteroduplex and an ethoxylated polyethylenimine delivery reagent), electroporation, or scrape loading.

Delivery into adult tissues is usually difficult, though there are a few systems allowing useful uptake of unmodified Morpholino oligos (including uptake into muscle cells with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or the vascular endothelial cells stressed during balloon angioplasty). Though they permeate through intercellular spaces in tissues effectively, unconjugated PMOs have limited distribution into the cytosol and nuclear spaces within healthy tissues following IV administration. Systemic delivery into many cells in adult organisms can be accomplished by using covalent conjugates of Morpholino oligos with cell-penetrating peptides, and, while toxicity has been associated with moderate doses of the peptide conjugates, they have been used &quot;in vivo&quot; for effective oligo delivery at doses below those causing observed toxicity. An octa-guanidinium dendrimer attached to the end of a Morpholino can deliver the modified oligo (called a Vivo-Morpholino) from the blood to the cytosol. Delivery-enabled Morpholinos, such as peptide conjugates and Vivo-Morpholinos, show promise as therapeutics for viral and genetic diseases.

<doc id="1078765" wikidata="Q7430726" url="?curid=1078765" title="Scenario paintball">
<text>Scenario paintball is a colloquialism used to represent a diverse array of paintball events that encompass many themes that may include historical re-enactments, movies, current pop culture, futuristic or video game simulations, and more. Others have no theme at all. They frequently feature game mechanics such as &quot;medics&quot; and &quot;snipers&quot; and &quot;helicopters&quot; carried out through various simulations. The common denominator for this type of play is anywhere from 75 to 5000 players, with at least 6 hours of continuous play. These events average 12 hours of game play across a weekend in 2 major play periods. The longest and most challenging events run 24 hours straight with no breaks, with elite players covering ultra marathon distances. Instead of playing on a single field at a venue, all fields are combined into one continuous playable area. To further enhance the theme of a game, field locations may be named for important story locations, and props of various sorts are added to the game. These may be objects that players collect for points, or even vehicles that take part in the fighting, like paintball tanks. Players may don costumes specific to the theme, such as historic military uniforms or other costumes. 

These events are best broken into sub-categories.

A Big Game is a type of scenario game that revolves around territory control with very few specific tasks given to players. They may or may not have a theme. These are designed for paintball first and foremost, but sometimes feature simulations. As player density at events increases, the tactics become increasingly Napoleonic, moving principal masses of players into perceived weak points to gain territory. 

A Paintball Scenario is a type of scenario game that revolves around 2 large sides of players performing specific tasks. These tasks at their core are designed to entertain players and encourage paint consumption by placing 2 relatively balanced teams in the same place at the same time. The tasks can be very simple such as a &quot;take and hold&quot; of territory on field, or very complex involving many locations, role-playing, mini games, and more. Game tasks are distributed by giving the task to an assigned commander for the team, who chooses players to carry out the task. Sometimes these tasks are simply put on a poster for all to see. 

A Scenario Paintball event is an immersive gaming experience that puts the theme, story line, role-playing, and simulation experiences above the paintball play. These events feature the most players in costumes, often with a bevy of melee weapons and unique experiences. These games may include escape rooms, large numbers of props, extensive simulations, and even open-world game play features. 

A Real Time Tactical event is a mixture of Big Game play and video game Real Time Strategy game mechanics. Players use the event mobile app&#x27;s Augmented Reality features to capture territory, build virtual structures, upgrade their forces, unlock special powers, and score points. Advanced game mechanics including capturing territory based on player GPS proximity, RGB light indicators on control points, image recognition, Heads Up Display compatibility, and AI content distribution. 

A Battle Royale event plays the same as video game Battle Royales. Using the event&#x27;s mobile app, players play over an increasingly shrinking playing field until only 1 person or team is left standing. 

Scenario events are usually planned far in advance, both by the event &quot;producers&quot; or fields, and by the players themselves. Players may form large, lasting networks of players and teams that play together year after year in a specific scenario. These organizations help plan game strategy and direct their groups on the field and offer a level of organization beyond the basic two-sided team play.

Modern events may feature many different playing styles in a single weekend, featuring Battle Royale games, A Big Game, and a Paintball Scenario across 3 days.

Like all forms of paintball, scenario paintball has a very good per-capita safety record. Due to longer play times, heat-related injuries are one of the more common injuries in scenario paintball. Many players often carry 1- to 3-liter water bladders, allowing players to drink water without removing their safety masks, to combat heat and dehydration.

==Gameplay==

Scenario paintball games allows paintball players (who may be divided into teams) to participate in a scenario, or story; which can include historical re-enactments, or fictional simulations. Because of the addition of a storyline to the game, and a larger contingent of players, scenario games tend to run over the course of hours or even days. Because of the potential size and length of matches, players tagged by paintballs, and hence eliminated, might be able to return to the playing field after a set time. The scenario itself may be punctuated by smaller rounds, in which teams may need to complete a simple objective such as holding a location while another team attacks.

A paintball scenario will have often have pre-planning by a director or producer and incorporate a theme - with popular simulations possibly drawn from action movies, military events, science fiction, historical events, or television shows. Games are generally designed for either single day play, which are run over an eight- to twelve-hour timespan during the daylight hours, or 24-hour play, which last for much longer and are more intricate. The entire game itself can be either one continuous match, or divided into smaller skirmishes and missions; with scoring for individual matches contributing to an overall score.

===Player roles===
Many scenario games add special roles to the paintball game. Some are strictly for the story line, describing the player as part of the group he or she is portraying. A player may be almost anything to fit the storyline, such as a rebel, an angry villager, a scientist or more. These roles have no effect on how the player plays.

Some roles have special game abilities that assist their team. For example, a player could be a demolitions expert, medic, pilot or spy. These roles offer the player a chance to perform additional tasks on top of shooting opposing players. For example, a medic player may be able to &quot;heal&quot; a certain number of teammates that have been hit by a paintball, returning them to the action that much faster.

When a player starts the game he/she is in some games issued an identification card. Some cards also indicate the player&#x27;s role in the scenario. Often, players enter scenario games purely for this role-playing aspect. Players are not required to play a role in the game, but those that accept a role may be provided with specific goals to accomplish in the game.

An important aspect of role-playing scenario games is that while missions win games, role-players develop information about those missions that gain more points.

This role-playing aspect extends off the field as well, and it is common for players to be &quot;in character&quot; both on and off the field for the duration of the game. Role-players often negotiate with other teams for props and information, and even attempt to get opposing players to defect. For role-players, the event may start before the game as they talk with other players on internet BBS/forums, perform character research, make phone calls between teams, and assemble costumes. These pre-game activities may start weeks or months before the first paintball is fired.

===Fields===
Fields are normally much bigger than standard paintball fields and can even have a combined total of many paintball fields. Fields can range from a small 3 vs 3 square, to a few acres, to over . Fields are generally an entire venue with every field put into use simultaneously and an out-of-bounds tape strung around it. This includes speed ball fields, castles, wooded areas, urban environments, and more.

===Props===
In most scenarios, props are incorporated to enhance the fun and role-playing aspects of the game. Typically these props are small, simple in make and design, clearly identifiable, and serve a specific purpose. Conventional examples would be a small wooden box, labeled “EXPLOSIVES,” or fake money used as currency between different sides during the game.

Props almost always have specific rules written about them by the scenario producers. For example, rules pertaining to the aforementioned box of explosives may specify that only specific role-players (such as demolitions, engineers, etc.) of the game may handle or operate the prop, and that if taken to the enemy base the prop may be used to “blow up” their base thus eliminating any players inside.

Some props are randomly strewn about on fields for players to find, turn in to their base, and earn their side points. Often scenario producers will write missions for each side to retrieve or defend a particular prop from a specified spot on the field. For instance, at EMR’s Castle Conquest XXI big game, in which 200 defenders defended a three-story castle against upwards of 800 attackers, the removal of any four (out of ten) props from the castle resulted in victory for the attackers.

===Equipment===
Not all, but many scenario players prefer military simulation, or &quot;Mil-Sim&quot; style gear, choosing equipment that emulates real military gear in form and function. It is not uncommon to see elaborate costumes, paintball rocket- and grenade-launchers, radios, electronic bugs, and other props built especially for the game.

Mil-Sim markers are not the only markers used. Standard paintball markers are often used, although some brightly colored models make it more difficult to remain hidden while using them.

Because players are on the field for many hours at a time, they generally pack more gear than they would in a regular woodsball game. Players may carry a large number of items, including maps, ID Cards, smoke and paint grenades, night vision systems, radios, and water. Vests emulating those worn by law enforcement and military personnel may be used. Because scenarios tend to be played in the woods or in a mix of woods and buildings, camouflage jerseys and pants are often worn.

===Tanks===
Paintball scenario games may include Armored Tanks the players have to interact with.

Motorized Tanks, (Heavy Armor), have specific rules which vary from field to field. A common rule is that players are not allowed within of a moving tank. Tanks are always limited to a speed of . Tanks can be constructed from golf carts, ATVs, 6x6s or even utility vehicles that have been converted into auto based tanks which are usually quite large. Some people have even fabricated scale tanks from scratch.

===Teams===
There are many scenario paintball teams that attend various events throughout the world. Teams may be informal, playing for the recreational value of the scenario game, or may be more competitive. Play styles and player types vary greatly, since the pace of scenario games offers opportunities for a wide variety of athletic levels to participate.

===Software===
Some teams use Force Tracking and communications mobile apps. These include BattleTac, BlueFox Tracker, and RKE Warlord.

==Big Game vs Paintball Scenario vs Scenario Paintball==
A Big Game focuses heavily on paintball play, typically carried out in a territory control format.
A paintball scenario game focuses heavily on paintball play, typically carried out in a task-based format, with the tasks designed for 2 evenly matched forces to run into each other somewhere on the field.
A scenario paintball game focuses heavily on the simulation and role-playing aspects, at the expense of the paintball play. These use a wide variety of tasks for players, territory control, and other game mechanics.

<text>Baylor School, commonly called Baylor, is a private, coeducational college-preparatory school in Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States. Founded in 1893, the school&#x27;s current campus comprises 690 acres and enrolls students in grades 6 to 12, including boarding students in grades 9 through 12. These students are served by Baylor&#x27;s 148-member faculty, over two-thirds of whom hold advanced degrees, including nearly 40 adults who live on campus and serve as dorm parents. Baylor has had a student win the Siemens Award for Advanced Placement in math and science and a teacher received the National Siemens Award for Exemplary Teaching.

As of 2005, Baylor had the best high school sports program in Tennessee and was in the top 25 nationwide according to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. In the past 21 years, Baylor has won 157 state championships, including a national record of 16 consecutive victories in women&#x27;s golf from 1995-2012. The school has also repeatedly been named national champion in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming, by &quot;Swimming World&quot; magazine. For the 2011-12 school year, Baylor enrolled 1070 young men and women, 20% of whom lived on campus, as representatives of 25 states and 30 countries.

==History==

===Origins===

Baylor School was founded in 1893 by John Roy Baylor, a graduate of the University of Virginia. He had been hired by leading men of Chattanooga to establish a college-preparatory school for the &quot;young men of the city&quot;, and on September 12, Baylor&#x27;s University School of Chattanooga opened its doors for its first class, a group of 31 boys between ages of 10 and 17, each charged a tuition of $100.
These classes were originally held in an old house in downtown Chattanooga, located at 101 McCallie Avenue; the school later moved to a location on Palmetto Street, also in the city. The first classes of the school were all-male; in 1900, the school began enrolling young women, but by 1912 had reverted to having an all-male class. The school did not again admit women until 1985, over 70 years later. In 1915, with the help of philanthropist John Thomas Lupton, Baylor moved to its current location overlooking the Tennessee River. That campus has since expanded to , but the quadrangle in the center of campus has never moved, marking the location of the heart of Baylor School.

===Military school===
In 1914, World War I broke out in Europe; by the fall of 1917, hundreds of thousands of American soldiers were fighting in the war. In response to the growing need of the United States for honorable, well-educated soldiers, Baylor became a military school, fully accredited by the U.S. War Department. Baylor remained a military school until 1971—the midst of the Vietnam War, when public support for the war was at an all-time low.

===New headmasters===
In 1925, the school began calling itself &quot;Baylor School&quot; in honor of its founder, who died in the following year. The school then named Dr. Alexander Guerry as its second headmaster. He remained in that position from 1926 to 1929, before leaving the school to become chancellor of the University of Chattanooga and then later chancellor of . His successor was Herbert B. Barks Sr., who remained as headmaster for the next 35 years. His successor was headmaster Scott Wilson, a graduate of the class of 1975. In 2021 Wilson retired. He is succeeded by Chris Angel, Baylor class of 1989.

===Rivalries===

The school has maintained a strong rivalry with the crosstown boys-only McCallie School ever since McCallie&#x27;s founding in 1905. Baylor historically had close ties with Chattanooga&#x27;s Girls Preparatory School, until Baylor admitted girls in 1985. The two schools are now rivals in girls&#x27; athletics.

==Finances==

===Endowment===
Baylor&#x27;s endowment (or net fund balance) was $132 million according to a tax return filed on November 14, 2011.
This endowment is maintained by about 20 trustees and is one of the 30 highest endowments among boarding schools in the United States.
On a per-student basis, $132 million divided by 1070 students yields an average value of over $120,000 per student, higher even than several universities such as Babson College, The College of William &amp; Mary, and Rochester Institute of Technology.

===Tuition===
Baylor&#x27;s tuition for 2022-2023 was $28,310 for day students, $57,340 for domestic boarding students and $61,875 for international boarding students. For boarders, Baylor offers need-based financial aid in addition to merit scholarships via its Distinguished Scholars Program. Baylor offers other scholarships to deserving boarding students for outstanding academic performance and character via donations through specific funds, one of which includes VMWare Fellowship Fund. For day students, Baylor also offers need-based financial aid, and awards the Jo Conn Guild Scholarship for students of exceptional merit. For Baylor&#x27;s 2015-16 school year, the average boarding student received an aid package worth $27,118; the average day student received an aid package worth $11,096.

==Academics==
*Baylor offers 22 advanced placement courses. In 1954, it was one of only 38 secondary schools, and the only one in the South, invited to participate in the then-new AP program.
*Baylor&#x27;s core curriculum consists of mathematics, English, science, history, and language classes. Baylor offers language classes in: Spanish, French, Latin, German, and Chinese.

*The graduating class of 2011 sent four graduates to Ivy League schools. Two students attended Stanford University. Colleges chosen most often the class of 2011 were the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (13), the University of Alabama (9), Sewanee: The University of the South (7), Ole Miss (6), the University of Florida (5), the University of Tennessee at Knoxville (5), Georgia Southern University (5), and Emory University (4).

==Athletics==
In 2005, Baylor was named the leading high school sports program in Tennessee for six consecutive years, and in the top 25 nationwide by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. For the 2006-07 school year, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; again named Baylor as the top athletic program in the state of Tennessee. Baylor&#x27;s 1973 football team was named national champions by the National Sports News Service, and both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swim teams have been named national champions by &quot;Swimming World&quot; magazine. Brian Gottfried, who played tennis for Baylor and was later inducted into its Hall of Fame, rose after graduating to become the number-three ranked singles player in the world. Baylor&#x27;s teams are nicknamed the Red Raiders and Lady Raiders. Baylor competes in the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association and its varsity sports are:
===State Championships===
&quot;As of December 2024&quot;
==Programs==
*Baylor students can participate in Baylor&#x27;s Walkabout program, an outdoors program that takes students kayaking, rock climbing, bouldering, trekking, hiking, and caving. Walkabout also goes on an annual trip to Costa Rica for advanced kayakers and a biennial trip to India to trek.
*Baylor&#x27;s community service program, which is known as &quot;R.E.S.P.E.C.T.&quot; (Regard Every Soul Purely Embracing Compassionate Thoughts), takes 10 students (juniors and seniors) to Kingston, Jamaica, every Spring Break after they have spent the school year raising money to send Jamaican children to school. On this trip, they visit a state-run home for the aged, a state-run orphanage, and the community whose children are sent to school with the money these high school students have raised. Students from the community service program also take trips to Asheville, North Carolina, twice a year to volunteer in a local homeless shelter. Baylor also does community service within the community of Chattanooga; there is an after school program in which students go to schools or centers within Chattanooga to help tutor children from surrounding schools and help them in their school work. This program is offered throughout the entire school year.
*Baylor has more than 60 other extracurricular organizations, including the Round Table Literary Discussion Society, which began in 1942, the Peer Tutor Program, the Student Congress and Model United Nations Team, and the annual &quot;Periaktoi&quot; art magazine.
*Tenth- and eleventh-grade students can participate in a student exchange program with schools around the world, such as the Southport School and St Hilda&#x27;s School in Southport, Queensland, Australia, along with Bishops College in Cape Town, South Africa.
*Seniors end their year with a senior camping trip, a tradition begun in 1975.

==Campus==
Baylor&#x27;s campus is located on the banks of the Tennessee River with red-brick buildings scattered around the campus, some almost 100 years old. Some of the buildings and facilities include:

*The Parry Center, located near the Tennis Center, is home to Baylor&#x27;s Walkabout program. There is also an indoor climbing gym located directly behind the Parry Center.

===Other campus features===
*Perched in the quadrangle in the heart of the campus is a statue of the mythological character Icarus, placed in memory of a student, Johnson Bryant, who died in a 2003 car wreck while a student at Baylor. The statue stands as a reminder to students to always find balance to avoid a similar fate, which was huffing butane gas while driving.

==Traditions==
As an outgrowth of the well-known Baylor/McCallie rivalry, the oldest rivalry in Tennessee, the school week of the football game is referred to as &quot;Spirit Week&quot;. During this time, students may forgo wearing the required uniform to wear themed costumes. The most commonly recurring of these themes is &quot;Red Day,&quot; which typically is on the Friday of the Baylor/McCallie football game, in celebration of the school&#x27;s color, in which the theme is to dress in as much red as is humanly possible. Prizes are awarded to whichever student is deemed by the school to be wearing the most red. In 2009 Baylor won the well-known rivalry football game against McCallie for the first time in eleven years, and had won the game against McCallie five times since then, from 2009-2013. Their most recent win against McCallie was in 2015. (The wins occurred in four regularly scheduled Baylor-McCallie games as well as a TSSAA playoff game.) In 2014, Baylor&#x27;s streak was cut short when McCallie decided to play at their home field, Spears Stadium. After that, the winning team was usually determined by home field advantage. That is until 2017 when McCallie won big against Baylor at Heywood Stadium. Since then, Baylor had suffered 6 straight losses against McCallie on both fields, as well as Finley Stadium in 2020 (they could not play at Spears Stadium due to the Coronavirus pandemic). . In 2022, the Red Raiders finally snapped the Blue Tornados 6 game win streak, winning 31-27.

==Honor code and Honor Council==
Baylor students must abide by the rules of Baylor&#x27;s honor code, established in 1916. Baylor School&#x27;s honor code is based on the honor code at the University of Virginia. When students enter the school, they sign a pledge: &quot;the Honor System is an understanding among Baylor student that they do not want among them one who will lie, cheat, or falsify information. I understand this principle, and I recognize that I shall be expected to live in accordance with it.&quot; After entry to Baylor, before every test, Baylor students sign their name, pledging &quot;I pledge that I have upheld both the letter and the spirit of the Baylor Honor Code, neither giving nor receiving unauthorized assistance on this assessment.&quot; Students who are charged with violating the honor code must stand trial with the Honor Council, consisting of two freshmen, three sophomores, four juniors, and five seniors. Punishments for violation of the honor code range from a warning to expulsion.

==Notable alumni and faculty==

===Alumni===

Baylor alumni excel in a multiplicity of fields. Perhaps the Baylor alum with the most historical significance is businessman Jo Conn Guild, who together with Wendell Willkie sued to oppose the Tennessee Valley Authority nearly one hundred years ago. In the current era, many alumni are noted for their work in politics, including U.S. Ambassador to NATO David M. Abshire, U.S. presidential candidate Thomas J. Anderson, Tennessee State Senator Bo Watson, Tennessee Attorney General Robert E. Cooper Jr., current Chattanooga mayor Tim Kelly, former Chattanooga mayor Andy Berke, Georgia Congressman Charlie Norwood, and the 48th Governor of Alabama, Fob James. Several Baylor graduates have excelled in medicine, including emergency medicine physician Francis M. Fesmire, and psychiatrist Robert Taylor Segraves. A number of Baylor graduates, such as Hugh Beaumont (famous for being the father on the classic 1950s and early 1960s TV show &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;), have gone on to have notable careers in entertainment. Many Baylor students go on to play sports collegiately and professionally, including Brian Gottfried who reached Nº3 in the world in tennis, World No. 4-ranked tennis player Roscoe Tanner, collegiate and pro golfers Keith Mitchell and Harris English, Olympic Gold Medal-winning swimmer Geoff Gaberino, swimmer Brad Hamilton, Pro Football Hall of Famer John Hannah, College Football Hall of Famer Herman Hickman, and pro football player Jacques McClendon and pro football player David Thomas. Notable alumni involved in journalism and literature include Pulitzer Prize–winning journalists and authors Bill Dedman and Wendell Rawls Jr.; newspaper editors Shelby Coffey III, and Albert Hodges Morehead; and authors Coleman Barks, William E. Duff, and Arthur Golden.

<doc id="1078770" wikidata="Q61101" url="?curid=1078770" title="Siegfried Buback">
<text>Siegfried Buback (3 January 1920, Wilsdruff, Saxony – 7 April 1977, Karlsruhe) was the Attorney General of West Germany from 1974 until his murder in 1977.

== Life and career ==
Buback studied at the University of Leipzig. From 1940 to 1945, he was a member of the Nazi Party, while serving as a soldier in World War II. From 1945 to 1947, he was a prisoner of war in France. In 1953 he became an attorney, and continued his career until 1972 as general attorney. 

His name first appeared in public in 1962 when he accused the political magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; of high treason in the &quot;Spiegel&quot; scandal. In 1966, the case lead to a groundbreaking ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany about the freedom of the press.

In the 1970s he was decidedly opposed to the Red Army Faction (RAF) and became the first assassination victim, along with his driver Wolfgang Göbel and judicial officer Georg Wurster, in a series of events called the &quot;German Autumn&quot;.

==Assassination==
On 7 April 1977, Buback was shot by members of the RAF while travelling from his home in Neureut to the Bundesgerichtshof in Karlsruhe. While Buback&#x27;s Mercedes 230.6 was stopped at a traffic light, two unknown persons on a Suzuki GS 750 motorcycle pulled alongside him, both wearing olive green motorcycle helmets. The passenger on the rear of the motorcycle quickly fired fifteen shots with a semi-automatic HK43 rifle at the vehicle before fleeing. Buback and his driver, Göbel, died at the scene of the crime; Wurster died six days later from his injuries. Even though four RAF members (Christian Klar, Knut Folkerts, Günter Sonnenberg, and Brigitte Mohnhaupt) were formally charged and prosecuted in connection with the Buback murder, important details of their involvement have not been solved. German authorities have so far been unable to find out who was driving the motorcycle and who was firing the weapon at Buback.
In April 2007, 30 years after his assassination, Buback&#x27;s violent death again became the subject of public discussion when his son, Michael Buback, was contacted by former RAF member Peter-Jürgen Boock. Boock shared details with Buback&#x27;s son indicating that it was Stefan Wisniewski who had fired the gun at Siegfried Buback. Verena Becker, another former RAF member, has also claimed Wisniewski was the killer.

On 6 July 2012, Becker was convicted of assisting the (still unknown) murderers and sentenced to four years in prison.

<doc id="1078772" wikidata="Q6489247" url="?curid=1078772" title="Largest naval battle in history">
<text>The &quot;largest naval battle in history&quot; is a disputed title between adherents of varying criteria which include the numbers of personnel or vessels involved in the naval battle, the total displacement of the vessels involved and sometimes the significance and implications of the battle. While battles fought in modern times are comparatively well-documented, the figures from those in pre-Renaissance era are generally believed by contemporary chroniclers to be exaggerated.

==Helmut Pemsel&#x27;s evaluation==
In 1975, the Austrian historian attempted to evaluate naval battles in history by a scoring system. He assigned a score to each of four aspects of a battle as follows:
* Numbers involved (1–4)
* Strategic significance (0–2)
* Tactical execution (0–2)
* Political significance (0–1)

According to him, the largest naval battle ever is the Battle of Leyte Gulf, scoring 8 of a possible 9 points total, while six others tied for second at 7 points each: Salamis, the Aegates, Actium, La Hogue, Trafalgar and Jutland.

==Candidates==
*Salamis, September 480BC. A fleet of 371 Greek ships defeated 600–900 Persian ships in this decisive battle off the coast of Athens. The high-end estimate of 1,271 ships involved is the largest number of ships involved in a single battle. Greek triremes typically had crews of about 200 men, and the smaller penteconters were each crewed by 50 oarsmen, yet the total number of personnel involved in the battle is uncertain.
*Cape Ecnomus, 256BC. One of Ancient Rome&#x27;s first major naval victories over its rival, the city of Carthage, during the First Punic War. In total the Roman fleet had 140,000 men on board: rowers, other crew, marines and soldiers. The number of Carthaginians is less certainly known but was estimated by Polybius at 150,000, and most modern historians broadly support this. If these figures are approximately correct, then this is possibly the largest naval battle of all time, by the number of combatants involved.
*Red Cliffs, winter of 208–209 AD. A decisive battle between the warlord Cao Cao and the warlords Sun Quan, Liu Bei and Liu Qi saw the much smaller allied force of 50,000 defeat Cao Cao&#x27;s at least 220,000-strong force. The precise estimates of numbers are likely lost to time, but it may be the largest in terms of participants as supported by some sources.
*Yamen, 19March 1279. This battle completed the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty&#x27;s conquest of the Southern Song Dynasty. It is claimed that more than 1,000 Song dynasty ships were destroyed by the Yuan dynasty fleet near Yamen, Guangdong, China. This is greater than the low-end estimate of ships involved at the Battle of Salamis; however not all Song ships were warships.
*Lake Poyang, 30August4October 1363. It is claimed to be the largest naval battle in terms of personnel, with a reported 850,000 sailors and soldiers involved. A Ming dynasty rebel force, said to be 200,000 strong, commanded by Zhu Yuanzhang, met a Han rebel force, claimed to be 650,000 strong, commanded by Chen Youliang, on Lake Poyang, China&#x27;s largest freshwater lake.
*Jutland, 31May1June 1916. The Imperial German Navy&#x27;s High Seas Fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer and the British Grand Fleet under Admiral Sir John Jellicoe engaged in battle near Jutland, Denmark, during World War I. The German fleet consisted of 16 dreadnought and 6 pre-dreadnought battleships, 5 battle cruisers, 11 light cruisers, and 61 fleet torpedo boats, while the British fleet was composed of 28 battleships, 9 battle cruisers, 8 armoured cruisers, 26 light cruisers, 78 destroyers, 1 minelayer, and 1 seaplane carrier. Britain suffered more casualties and lost more ships than Germany but the outcome was a strategic success for the British since it resulted in the successful containment of the German fleet. In terms of total displacement of ships involved, it was the largest surface battle.
*Philippine Sea, 19–20June 1944. This was the largest aircraft carrier battle in history, involving fifteen American fleet and light carriers, nine Japanese carriers, 170 other warships, and some 1,700 aircraft. In terms of displacement, the U.S. Fifth Fleet&#x27;s Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 58) is the largest single naval formation ever to give battle.

*Leyte Gulf, 23–26October 1944. The largest in terms of displacement of ships in the combined orders of battle, if not necessarily in terms of displacement of the ships engaged, was also the largest in terms of the displacement of ships sunk and in terms of the size of the area within which the component battles took place. The United States Third and Seventh Fleets (in total, Task Forces 38, 77, 78, and 79) including some Australian warships, comprised 8 large aircraft carriers, 8 light carriers, 18 escort carriers, 12 battleships, 24 cruisers, 141 destroyers and destroyer escorts, and many other ships, as well as about 1,500 aircraft. The Allies won a decisive victory over Japanese forces, which consisted of 1 large aircraft carrier, 3 light carriers, 9 battleships, 19 cruisers, 34 destroyers, and several hundred aircraft. The opposing fleets carried a combined total of about 200,000 personnel. Leyte Gulf consisted of four major subsidiary battles: the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, the Battle of Surigao Strait, the Battle off Samar, and the Battle off Cape Engaño, along with other actions. They are counted together by virtue of all being a result of the Japanese operation &quot;Sho-Go&quot;, which was aimed at destroying the Allied amphibious forces involved in the invasion of Leyte. However, the individual battles were separated by distances as great as two hundred miles, as well as several days time, from the first submarine action to the Japanese withdrawal.

<doc id="1078776" wikidata="Q882861" url="?curid=1078776" title="James Lee Byars">
<text>James Lee Byars (April 10, 1932 – May 23, 1997) was an American conceptual artist and performance artist specializing in installations and sculptures, as well as a self-considered mystic. He was best known for his use of personal esoteric motifs, and his creative persona that has been described as &#x27;half dandified trickster and half minimalist seer&#x27;. Byars was born Detroit, Michigan, and died in Cairo, Egypt.

Byars&#x27; notable performance works include &quot;The Death of James Lee Byars&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Smile&quot;, and in terms of multiple sculptures, the many letters he wrote that were composed as decorated sculptures.

==Themes and motifs in his works==
Byars&#x27; works are often noted as constantly incorporating specific personal themes and motifs, leaning towards the esoteric while simultaneously being ritualistic and materialistic: Robert Clark, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot; on the occasion of a Milton Keynes exhibition of his work, described it as &#x27;impenetrably yet intriguingly hermetic&#x27;. Most in particular was gold as a material, which served as an elemental identifier. As well as this, works of his demonstrate a fascination with the symbolism of numbers: Clark quotes in the same exhibition, referring to a specific piece of his, writing that he &#x27;imbued the number 100 with symbolic significance, having made a symmetrical arrangement of 100 white marbles and draping 100 nude volunteers in a collective red garment&#x27;.

A common theme in his works is perfection (especially upon the word &#x27;Perfect&#x27;), which he extended into a personal journey that led to his ambiguously celebratory exploration of shapes, numbers and precious materials. A MoMA text explaining his oeuvre, in the context of his piece &quot;The Table of Perfect&quot;, noted that while it &quot;looks pristine, it—like any other object—can only ever exist as a sign of perfection and can never embody the total concept.&quot;

Byars was in 1972 the first artist invited to visit the physics laboratory CERN in Geneva—an event that was featured on the cover of the &quot;CERN Courier&quot;. Later many artists have passed through the laboratory, since 2012 mainly within the framework of the Arts at CERN programme. Arts resulting from his visit to CERN was exposed at Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in 2004 and is digitally available from the Harvard Art Museums. 

The American artist Matthew Barney played Byars in the film &quot;River of Fundament&quot; (2014), a work loosely based on the Norman Mailer novel &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot;. Barney has argued,
I think Byars had this Egyptian subtext through his work. [...] &quot;Ancient Evenings&quot; is to do with the ambition of the Pharaoh and the ambition of the nobleman to live again and again and again. So there&#x27;s something about Byars that has always interested me in his work to do with its ambition to become pure gold and its failure to be pure gold. It&#x27;s always a veneer. It wants to be something it can&#x27;t be. And I love that about the work, I love the theatre of it.

Byars also showed fascination in predicting his own death and others&#x27; deaths.

<text>is a Japanese professional football club based in Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. They currently play in J2 League, the Japanese second tier of professional football.

== History ==
Founded in 1988 as &quot;Tohoku Electric Power Co., Inc. Soccer Club&quot;, Vegalta Sendai joined the J-League in 1999 after playing a few seasons in the JFL, with the nickname &quot;Brummell Sendai&quot;, to which they had been promoted in 1994 from the Tohoku Regional League. When joining the J-League, the name Vegalta was chosen as a homage to the famous Tanabata festival in Sendai. The names of the two celestial stars of the Tanabata legend, &quot;Vega&quot; and &quot;Altair&quot; were combined to form &quot;Vegalta&quot;.

They were first promoted to the top flight in 2002, but the team went back down the following season. They were promoted again for the 2010 season.

In 2011, despite the earthquake and tsunami, they achieved their highest position up to that time, 4th place in the top division.

In 2012, despite leading the table for most of the season, Sanfrecce Hiroshima&#x27;s challenge proved too strong, and losing the penultimate week game to relegation battler Albirex Niigata cost them the title, rendering them second-place winners, their highest position in history.

In 2018, the Vegalta reached the final of the Emperor&#x27;s Cup, losing 1-0 to Urawa Reds.

After twelve years spent in the J1 League, Vegalta returned to the J2 in 2022, after being relegated from the J1 at the end of 2021. After finishing in seventh place in the 2022 J2 League, thus failing to reach the promotion play-offs. Ryang Yong-gi, a symbol of Sendai, retired at the end of the 2023 season.

For the 2024 season, Yoshiro Moriyama, who has a track record of developing players at Sanfrecce Hiroshima&#x27;s training age group and the U17 Japan National Team, was appointed as Manager.

== Stadium ==
Their home stadium is Yurtec Stadium Sendai, in Izumi-ku, Sendai, although a few home games have also been played at nearby Miyagi Stadium.

Sendai Stadium ranks among the top stadiums in Japan for its presence, comfort, and accessibility, and was once ranked second in an evaluation by a famous Japanese football media. It was also used by the Italian national football team as their basecamp during the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

Miyagi Stadium is famous for the Japan national team, and for hosting matches of the Argentine national team in the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

==Supporters and rivalries==

As with most football clubs, fans in Sendai sing and dance during matches. However, most of the songs used by fans from other clubs are avoided due to the more eclectic set. Club themes sung before each game are &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot;, and during the game. Toy Dolls, Blitzkrieg Bop and other KISS and Twisted Sister songs.

Since Sendai is the hometown of Hirohiko Araki, who wrote JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure, fans often wave flags with the same motifs of characters portrayed in Araki&#x27;s manga.

===Michinoku Derby===
Vegalta&#x27;s traditional rivals are Montedio Yamagata from Yamagata Prefecture. The two have been rivals since meeting in the Tohoku Football League in 1991. Among the Tohoku derbies, this match is famous as the Michinoku derby.

===Tohoku Derby===
This is the derby played by the Tohoku region teams, currently the most important match is that of Vegalta Sendai and Montedio Yamagata. Other teams included in this classic include Blaublitz Akita, Iwate Grulla Morioka, Iwaki FC.

=== Mascot ===

*VEGATTA (Brother)
** He has won &quot;the J League mascot general election&quot; many times and is quite popular.
** The eagle, which is also used in the club emblem as a symbol of victory in Greek mythology, is associated with the Aquila constellation, to which Hikoboshi (Altair) belongs, which is the origin of the club&#x27;s name. The name was decided by public submission. Vegatta&#x27;s SNS (BLOG, Twitter), which is updated daily, is loved and popular among soccer fans in Japan, as the mascot loves mischief, and is by some fans, hard to believe it is a mascot.
* LTAANA (Sister)
** From the Sendai summer tradition &quot;Sendai Tanabata&quot;, which is the origin of the team name, &quot;Luta&quot; for Vega (Orihime) and Altair (Hikoboshi), and &quot;Tana&quot; for Tanabata, it was named as a girlish name by combining &quot;na&quot;, on a 7 August, which is the date of the event and the birthday. Sometimes she tweet with [#ルターナ] (LTAANA written phonetically on Katakana) on Sendai&#x27;s official Twitter.
** When Vegalta wins any match, she expresses her joy on Twitter.

=== Cheerleaders ===

*The Vegalta Cheerleaders mainly support &quot;Vegalta Sendai&quot;, participate in many events, and continue to work as a cheering group for people who are doing their best in the area. She has the longest history as a cheerleader for a professional sports team in Sendai, and has been active since 2003.

== Best Match ==
① and ② were selected as &quot;that game I want to see again&quot; on the J League official YouTube channel, and 2 was also selected as &quot;10 Best Matches&quot; by J Chronicle Best. ② was also selected as the &quot;Best Match&quot; of the J30 Best Awards.

=== J Chronicle Best ===
This is a project to select the J.League &quot;Best Eleven&quot;, &quot;Best Goal&quot; and &quot;Best Match&quot; over the past 20 years. A project held in 2013 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Japan Professional Soccer League. The mentioned two game is often featured as a legendary game in each media.

=== J30 BEST AWARDS ===

A project to select the &quot;MVP&quot;, &quot;Best Eleven&quot;, &quot;Best Goal&quot;, &quot;Best Match&quot;, and &quot;Best Scene&quot; of the J League over the past 30 years. An award hosted by the J.League to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of the J.League in 2023.

Even in &quot;Soccer Digest&quot; (Japan&#x27;s famous football media),the two were selected as &quot;the best 3 selected J.League matches&quot; by the reporter in charge of Sendai. Sendai&#x27;s Yoshiaki Ota, who scored the equalizing goal against Kawasaki, said, &quot;I think it was a goal that everyone worked together, including the thoughts of my teammates.&quot;

*The notation of the match card and the stadium where the match was held is at the time of the match.
== Continental record ==

Sendai also participated in the ACL for the first time in 2013.

It was a tournament with many challenges other than matches, such as long-distance travel, overcrowded schedule with the J.League and local climate, but they did not lose in the extreme cold of Nanjing and the intense heat of Thailand and the final match was a draw or better in the qualifying.

It was a good point to leave the possibility of breaking through.

<text>Peter Heylyn or Heylin (29 November 1599 – 8 May 1662) was an English ecclesiastic and author of many polemical, historical, political and theological tracts. He incorporated his political concepts into his geographical books &quot;Microcosmus&quot; in 1621 and &quot;Cosmographie&quot; (1657).

==Life==
Heylyn was born in Burford, Oxfordshire, the son of Henry Heylyn and Elizabeth Clampard. He entered Merchant Taylors&#x27; School in March 1612. At 14 he was sent to Hart Hall, Oxford, and matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford, on 19 January 1616, aged 16. He was awarded BA on 17 October 1617 and was elected a Fellow in 1618. He lectured on historical geography at Magdalen.

Heylyn was awarded MA on 1 July 1620. In 1620 he presented his lecture to Prince Charles, at Theobalds. He was incorporated at Cambridge University in 1621. In 1621 his lectures were published as &quot;Microcosmos: a Little Description of the Great World&quot;. This would prove to be his most popular work and by 1639, eight editions had been produced.

At college, where he was dubbed &#x27;the perpetual dictator&#x27;, Heylyn had been an outspoken controversialist. He subsequently became an outspoken preacher and one of Charles I&#x27;s clerical followers. He was awarded a BD on 13 June 1629. As a member of the Arminian party he played a part in struggles between the Arminians and their opponents that disturbed England in the 1630s. In 1630 he lectured against the Feoffees for Impropriations. He became licensed Canon of Westminster in 1631 and Rector of Hemingford, Huntingdonshire, in the same year. He became Rector of Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, in 1632 and rector of Alresford, Hampshire, in 1633. Also in 1633 he was licensed to preach and was awarded D.D. on 13 April 1633. He became a chaplain to Charles I. In 1639 he became Rector at South Warnborough, Hampshire.

He suffered for his loyalty to the king when, under the Commonwealth, he was deprived of his preferments. He subsequently settled at Lacies Court in Abingdon, from 1653 until 1660. Lacies Court is now the heads residence at Abingdon School. Heylyn supported Anthony Huish (Master of the School) in maintaining the services at St Nicholas Church where Huish was rector. This was opposed by the Puritan dominated town council. A house facing Bath Street from the Abingdon School grounds is named &#x27;Heylyns&#x27; in commemoration.

At the Restoration, he left Abingdon and was made sub-Dean of Westminster, but poor health prevented further advancement.

He married Letitia Highgate and had a large family. His monument is in Westminster Abbey.

==Works==

He was a prolific writer, and a keen and acrimonious controversialist against the Puritans. Among his works are a &quot;History of the Reformation of the Church of England&quot;, and a Life of Archbishop William Laud (&quot;Cyprianus Anglicanus&quot;) (1668). He affixed Greek titles to two of his books, &quot;Κειμήλια Ἐκκλησιαστικά: Historical and miscellaneous tracts&quot; (1662) and &quot;Ἡρωολογία Anglorum; or, a help to English history&quot; (1641).

He was the writer of the &quot;Cosmographie&quot;, an attempt to describe in meticulous detail every aspect of the known world in 1652, the geography, climate, customs, achievements, politics, and belief systems. It appears to have been the first description in print of Australia, and perhaps of California, Terra del Fuego, and other territories in the New World. He objected to the name &quot;America&quot; as it placed undue glory on Amerigo Vespucci, and recommended &quot;Columbana&quot; or &quot;Cabotia&quot; as more indicative of the true discoverers, Columbus and Cabot.

<doc id="1078785" wikidata="Q738153" url="?curid=1078785" title="Ileus">
<text>Ileus is a disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine. It can be caused by lack of peristalsis or by mechanical obstruction.
The word &#x27;ileus&#x27; derives . The term &#x27;subileus&#x27; refers to a partial obstruction.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of ileus include, but are not limited to:
* moderate to severe, diffuse abdominal pain
* constipation
* abdominal distension
* nausea/vomiting, especially after meals
* vomiting of bilious fluid (green or yellowish-green in colour)
* flatulence and/or lack of bowel movement
* excessive belching

==Cause==
Decreased propulsive ability may be broadly classified as caused either by bowel obstruction or by intestinal atony or paralysis. However, instances with symptoms and signs of a bowel obstruction occur, but with the absence of a mechanical obstruction, mainly in acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, Ogilvie&#x27;s syndrome. In 2023 the US FDA reported gastrointestinal ileus as an adverse effect of the medication semaglutide, with frequency and causal relationship unknown.

===Bowel obstruction===

A bowel obstruction is generally a mechanical obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract and can occur anywhere from the Ligament of Treitz to the anus. When the obstruction affects only the small intestine, it is generally referred to as a small bowel obstruction to distinguish it from a colonic obstruction, which may or may not affect the small intestine. The distinction helps to narrow the possible causes and treatment.

Common causes of small bowel obstruction include post-operative adhesions, hernias, intussusception, and intraabdominal tumors. Common causes of colonic obstruction include primary colon cancer, volvulus and post-operative adhesions. When the ileocecal valve is competent, colonic obstruction may manifest as gaseous distention of the colon, but not the small intestine; when the ileocecal valve is incompetent, it does not prevent retrograde passage of air and stool and a colonic obstruction will cause dilation of both large and small bowel. 

Bowel obstructions can be partial or complete. They can be differentiated on imaging by the intestinal gas pattern. Partial obstructions will have gas distal to the obstruction, whereas a complete obstruction will not. Sounds of &quot;rushes and tinkles&quot; are associated with partial obstructions and represent brief passages of fluid and gas (respectively) through the partial obstruction. Complete obstructions do not make these sounds.

===Intestinal paralysis===
Paralytic ileus is paralysis of the intestine, whether or not complete, sufficient to prohibit the passage of food through the intestine and lead to intestinal blockage. It causes constipation and bloating. On listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope, no bowel sounds are heard because the bowel is inactive. It is a common side effect of some types of surgery, termed postsurgical ileus. It can also result from certain drugs and from various injuries and illnesses, such as acute pancreatitis. 

A temporary paralysis of a portion of the intestines occurs typically after abdominal surgery. Since the intestinal content of this portion is unable to move forward, food or drink should be avoided until peristaltic sound is heard, by auscultation (use of a stethoscope) of the area where this portion lies. Intestinal atony or paralysis may be caused by inhibitory neural reflexes, inflammation or other implication of neurohumoral peptides.

===Risk factors===
* gastrointestinal surgery or other GI procedures
* electrolyte imbalance (Namely hypokalemia and hypercalcemia)
* diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and other causes of metabolic acidosis
* hypothyroidism
* diabetes
* medications (e.g. opioids or antimuscarinics)
* severe illness (inflammation with peritonitis)
* spinal cord injury, those with injury above thoracic vertebra 5 (T5) will have hypomotility problems within the bowel
* acute intermittent porphyria

==Treatment==
Traditionally, nothing by mouth was considered to be mandatory in all cases, but gentle feeding by enteral feeding tube may help to restore motility by triggering the gut&#x27;s normal feedback signals, so this is the recommended management initially. When the patient has severe, persistent signs that motility is completely disrupted, nasogastric suction and parenteral nutrition may be required until passage is restored. In such cases, continuing aggressive enteral feeding causes a risk of perforating the gut.

Several options are available in the case of paralytic ileus. Most treatment is supportive. If caused by medication, the offending agent is discontinued or reduced. Bowel movements may be stimulated by prescribing lactulose, erythromycin or, in severe cases that are thought to have a neurological component (such as Ogilvie&#x27;s syndrome), neostigmine. There is also evidence from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that chewing gum, as a form of &#x27;sham feeding&#x27;, may stimulate gastrointestinal motility in the post-operative period and reduce the duration of postoperative ileus.

If possible the underlying cause is corrected (e.g. replace electrolytes).

==Other animals==
Ileus is a cause of colic in horses due to functional obstruction of the intestines. It is most commonly seen in horses postoperatively, especially following colic surgery. Horses experiencing ileus are at risk for gastric rupture due to rapid reflux build-up, and require intense medical management with frequent nasogastric intubation. Ileus may increase adhesion formation, because intestinal segments have more prolonged contact and intestinal distention causes serosal injury and ischemia. It is usually treated with aggressive fluid support, prokinetics, and anti-inflammatories.

==Terminology==
ICD-10 coding reflects both impaired-peristalsis senses and mechanical-obstruction senses of the term as modified by various adjectives. Some authors have argued for trying to reserve the term for the impaired-peristalsis senses, under which prescription certain older terms such as &quot;gallstone ileus&quot; and &quot;meconium ileus&quot;, although now technically misnomers, are still accepted as correct owing to their long-established usage.

<doc id="1078791" wikidata="Q880060" url="?curid=1078791" title="Black Athena">
<text>Black Athena: The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization, published in 1987 (vol. 1), 1991 (vol. 2), and 2006 (vol. 3), is a pseudoarchaeological trilogy by Martin Bernal proposing an alternative hypothesis on the origins of ancient Greece and classical civilisation. Bernal&#x27;s thesis discusses the perception of ancient Greece in relation to Greece&#x27;s North African and West Asian neighbours, especially the ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians who, he believes, colonized ancient Greece producing the bulk of Classical civilization. Bernal proposed that a change in the Western perception of Greece in the 18th century lead to the denial of any significant Egyptian and Phoenician influence on ancient Greek civilization.

&quot;Black Athena&quot; has been heavily criticised and rejected by academics. They often highlight the fact that there is no archaeological or historical evidence for ancient Egyptian colonization of mainland Greece or the Aegean Islands. Academic reviews of Bernal&#x27;s work overwhelmingly reject his heavy reliance on ancient Greek mythology, speculative assertions, and handling of archaeological, linguistic, and historical data.

==Thesis==
===Origins of Ancient Greek civilization===

Bernal rejects the theory that Greek civilization was founded by Indo-European settlers from Central Europe. This theory, which Bernal calls &quot;the Aryan model&quot;, came to be generally accepted during the 19th century. Bernal defends instead what he calls &quot;the Ancient model&quot;; the name refers to the fact that Egyptian and Phoenician (as well as Mesopotamian and Anatolian) influences on the Greek world were widely accepted in antiquity.

Bernal discusses Aeschylus&#x27;s play, &quot;The Suppliants&quot;, which describes the arrival in Argos from Egypt of the &quot;Danaids&quot;, daughters of Danaus. Cadmus was believed to have introduced the Asiatic Phoenician alphabet to Greece. Herodotus also mentions Eastern influences. Thucydides did not, which Bernal explains with his nationalistic wish to set up a sharp distinction between Greeks and barbarians. Plutarch attacked Herodotus&#x27; view that the Greeks had learned from barbarians. Yet Alexander the Great was very interested in Egypt; Plutarch himself wrote a work &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot;, part of the &quot;Moralia&quot;, which is a major source on Egypt. Admiration for Egypt was widespread in the Hellenistic and Roman civilizations, especially in the Neoplatonic school. Hermeticism was based on writings attributed to Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus, the so-called Hermetica or &quot;Hermetic corpus&quot;. These pro-Egyptian currents influenced Christianity, Judaism and Islam, as well as Renaissance figures such as Copernicus, Ficino and Giordano Bruno. It was demonstrated in 1614 that the Hermetic corpus was not very ancient at all and originated in late antiquity, though more recent scholarship has established that parts of it do probably have a Pharaonic origin. Casaubon&#x27;s textual analysis partly discredited the Hermetic corpus, but Bernal maintained that respect for Ancient Egypt survived and contributed to the Enlightenment in the 18th century. The Freemasons are particularly relevant.

Bernal traces thus the influence from the Ancient Egyptians and Phoenicians to the Ancient Greeks, and a tradition of acknowledgement of those links from Antiquity to the Enlightenment.

Bernal uses linguistic evidence to support his claim of a link between Ancient Greece and earlier Egyptian and Phoenician civilizations. The Classical Greek language arose from the Proto-Greek language with influences from the Anatolian languages such as Hittite, Luwian, Hurrian and Hattian that were spoken nearby, and the culture is assumed to have developed from a comparable amalgamation of elements.

However, Bernal attempts to emphasize North African elements in Ancient Near Eastern culture and denounces the alleged Eurocentrism of 19th and 20th century research, including the very slogan &quot;Ex Oriente Lux&quot; of Orientalists which, according to Bernal, betrays &quot;the Western appropriation of ancient Near Eastern culture for the sake of its own development.&quot;

Bernal proposes instead that Greek evolved from the contact between an Indo-European language and culturally influential Egyptian and West Asian Semitic languages. He believes that many Greek words have Egyptian or Semitic roots. Bernal places the introduction of the Greek alphabet (unattested before 750 BC) between 1800 and 1400 BC, and the poet Hesiod in the tenth century.

===Ideologies of classical scholarship===
The first volume of &quot;Black Athena&quot; describes in detail Bernal&#x27;s views on how the &quot;Ancient model&quot; acknowledging Egyptian and Phoenician influences on Greece came under attack during the 18th and 19th centuries. Bernal concentrates on four interrelated forces: the Christian reaction, the idea of &quot;progress&quot;, racism and Romantic Hellenism.

&quot;The Christian reaction&quot;. Already Martin Luther had fought the Church of Rome with the Greek Testament. Greek was seen as a sacred Christian tongue which Protestants could plausibly claim was more Christian than Latin. Many French students of Ancient Greece in the 17th century were brought up as Huguenots. The study of Ancient Greece especially in Protestant countries created an alliance between Greece and Protestant Christianity which tended to exclude other influences.

&quot;The idea of progress&quot;. The antiquity of Egypt and Mesopotamia had previously made those civilizations particularly worthy of respect and admiration, but the emergence of the idea of progress portrayed later civilizations as more advanced and therefore better. Earlier cultures came to be seen as based on superstition and dogmatism.

&quot;Racism&quot;. The Atlantic slave trade and later European colonialism required the intellectual justification of racism. It became paramount to divorce Africans and Africa from high civilisation, and Egypt from Africa itself. Ancient Greeks would be divorced from Ancient Egypt through the concept of the Greek Miracle, and would be reclaimed as whites and Europeans.

&quot;Romanticism&quot;. Romantics saw humans as essentially divided in &quot;national&quot; or &quot;ethnic&quot; groups. The German philosopher Herder encouraged Germans to be proud of their origins, their language and their national characteristics or national &quot;genius&quot;. Romantics longed for small, virtuous and &quot;pure&quot; communities in remote and cold places: Switzerland, North Germany and Scotland. When considering the past, their natural choice was Greece. The Philhellenic movement led to new archaeological discoveries as well as contributed to the Greek War of Independence from the Ottoman empire. Most Philhellenes were Romantics and Protestants.

== Reception ==
The original response to Bernal by Near Eastern scholars, historians, classicists, biological anthropologists, linguists, egyptologists and archaeologists was overwhelmingly negative and critical. A 2013 article noted that Bernal&#x27;s trilogy &quot;has been an object of much ridicule and a little curiosity&quot;.

As of 1999, over 100 negative reviews had been published about Black Athena, as well as several books refuting its assertions. According to Jacques Berlinerblau:

Ronald H. Fritze expands on Berlinerbau&#x27;s statement, writing that:

According to Christina Riggs, &quot;Black Athena&quot; was embraced by Afrocentrists and postcolonial studies even as archaeology, Egyptology and classical scholarship rejected much of Bernal&#x27;s evidence and, implicitly or explicitly, his central thesis.

There is no archaeological evidence that would clearly indicate a colonization which Bernal suggests. He himself says: “Here again, it should be made clear that, as with archaeological evidence, there are no smoking guns. There are no contemporary documents of the type &#x27;X the Egyptian/Phoenician arrived at this place in Greece and established a city/kingdom (t)here&#x27;, explicitly confirming the Ancient Model. Nor, for that matter, are there others denying it”. Bernal also dedicates &quot;Black Athena&quot; to V. Gordon Childe and his book does fall into Childe&#x27;s outdated paradigm of culture-historical archaeology. Michael Shanks criticized this outdated approach to archaeology stating:

In her review &quot;The Use and Abuse of Black Athena&quot; Professor of Classics Molly Myerowitz Levine states that:

Paul Oskar Kristeller, writing in the &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas,&quot; states that Bernal’s work is full of gross errors and that it has not received the criticism it deserves due to political reasons.

Scholars also criticized the fact that Bernal speaks of a unified Ancient Greek people and speaks of &quot;Hellenic nationalism&quot; and &quot;national pride&quot; in the 5th century BC which does not have any historical backing as the Greeks were not unified until the Hellenistic period and the tensions between different poleis was sometimes so great that it escalated into wars like the Peloponnesian War.

The book also ignited a debate in the academic community. While some reviewers contend that studies of the origin of Greek civilization were tainted by a foundation of 19th century racism, many have criticized Bernal for what they perceive to be the speculative nature of his hypothesis, unsystematic and linguistically incompetent handling of etymologies and a naive handling of ancient myth and historiography. The claims made in &quot;Black Athena&quot; were heavily questioned &quot;inter alia&quot; in &quot;Black Athena Revisited&quot; (1996), a collection of essays edited by Mary Lefkowitz and her colleague Guy MacLean Rogers.

Critics voice their strongest doubts over Bernal&#x27;s approach to language and word derivations (etymologies). Cambridge Egyptologist John D. Ray has accused Bernal&#x27;s work of having a confirmation bias. Edith Hall compares Bernal&#x27;s thesis to the myth of the Olympian gods overwhelming the Titans and Giants, which was once thought of as a historical recollection of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; taking over from Neanderthal man. She asserts that this historical approach to myth firmly belongs in the 19th century.

Others have challenged the lack of archaeological evidence for Bernal&#x27;s thesis. Egyptologist James Weinstein points out that there is very little evidence that the ancient Egyptians were a colonizing people in the third millennium and second millennium BC. Furthermore, there is no evidence for Egyptian colonies of any sort in the Aegean world. Weinstein accuses Bernal of relying primarily on his interpretations of Greek myths as well as distorted interpretations of the archaeological and historical data.

Bernal has also been accused of pursuing political motives and enlisting Bronze Age Greece in an academic war against Western civilisation. Bernal in fact made no secret of his political motives and at the end of his introduction to Black Athena wrote that, “the political purpose of Black Athena is, of course, to lessen European cultural arrogance”. According to historian David Gress:

In 2001, Bernal published &quot;Black Athena Writes Back: Martin Bernal Responds to Critics&quot; as a response to criticism of his earlier works. After the publication of this volume, according to scholar A.K Jayesh, &quot;Bernal’s critics had realized the futility of their enterprise and given up: neither the response, nor the final instalment of Black Athena – aimed to furnish linguistic evidence for the claim that close to forty percent of the Greek vocabulary with no known Indo=European cognates has its roots, in fact, in Afroasiatic languages – elicited much of a response&quot;.

The Egyptologist John Baines has, while rejecting his overall thesis, praised Bernal for the fact that he studied ancient Greece in a wider cultural and geographical context, which Baines asserts classicists tend not to do. Thomas McEvilley concluded in 2002 that while Bernal&#x27;s &quot;analysis of earlier periods of anti-Semitic attitude in regard to ancient Near Eastern culture may remain valuable, his attempt ... to derive Greek philosophy from Africa seems so glaringly unsupported by evidence that it is likely to pass without leaving a trace.&quot;

Classicist and linguist Jean-Fabrice Nardelli, in one of the very few reviews of Black Athena&#x27;s third volume, writes that Bernal&#x27;s &quot;faith in his ability to pinpoint sound shifts in (P)IE matching, or stemming from, Afroasiatic and in the rightness of multilateral lexical comparisons &quot;à la&quot; Greenberg over the standard comparative method, looks misplaced; for he has not checked his facts and stands at the mercy of sources notorious for their quirks and errors. He notes that Bernal suffers from &quot;proneness to blunders [which] further compromises his construct&quot;. Nardelli concludes that Bernal &quot;applies no method but &quot;ad hoc&quot; reasoning based on contingency&quot; and that &quot;[t]he book is full of red herrings that betray its quality&quot;.

A number of archaeogenetic studies in the modern era have since refuted Bernal&#x27;s hypotheses of an Egyptian or Phoenician colonisation of Greece. For instance, a 2017 study from Harvard University led by leading population geneticist Iosif Lazaridis, the full genomes of 19 Bronze Age individuals, including Minoans from Crete and Mycenaeans from mainland Greece were extracted and analysed. With regards to Bernal&#x27;s claims, the authors concluded that:

Nevertheless, since 2010, other scholars have argued for the ongoing relevance of Bernal&#x27;s work, even while disagreeing with many of its specifics. In &quot;African Athena: New Agendas&quot; (2011), the contributors argue that some of the issues that Bernal&#x27;s books raise have been neglected until relatively recently. These researchers have begun to examine Bernal&#x27;s trilogy through a different lens, arguing that it still holds some importance.

<text>Aaron Hill (10 February 1685 – 8 February 1750) was an English dramatist and miscellany writer.

==Biography==
The son of a country gentleman of Wiltshire, Hill was educated at Westminster School, and afterwards travelled in the East. He was the author of 17 plays, some of them, such as his versions of Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zaire&quot; and &quot;Mérope&quot;, being adaptations. He also wrote poetry, which is of variable quality. Having written some satiric lines on Alexander Pope, he received in return a mention in &quot;The Dunciad&quot;, which led to a controversy between the two writers. Afterwards a reconciliation took place. He was a friend and correspondent of Samuel Richardson, whose &quot;Pamela&quot; he highly praised. In addition to his literary pursuits Hill was involved in many commercial schemes, usually unsuccessful.

Hill was the manager of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane when he was 24 years old, and before being summarily fired for reasons unknown, he staged the premier of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s &quot;Rinaldo,&quot; the first Italian opera designed for a London audience. The composer was very involved in the production, and Hill collaborated on the libretto, although it is disputed what his actual contributions were.

In 1724 he founded the bi-weekly periodical &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot;. A posthumous collection of Hill&#x27;s essays, letters and poems was published in 1753. His &quot;Dramatic Works&quot; were published in 1760. His biography was recorded in &quot;Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, to the Time of Dean Swift&quot;, volume 5 (ostensibly by Theophilus Cibber but generally accepted to be of anonymous authorship).

==Selected works ==

<doc id="1078820" wikidata="Q2896842" url="?curid=1078820" title="Vog">
<text>Vog is a form of air pollution that results when sulfur dioxide and other gases and particles emitted by an erupting volcano react with oxygen and moisture in the presence of sunlight. The word is a portmanteau of the words &quot;volcanic&quot; and &quot;smog&quot;. The term is in common use in the Hawaiian Islands, where the Kīlauea volcano, on the Island of Hawaii (the &quot;Big Island&quot;), erupted continuously between 1983 and 2018. Based on June 2008 measurements, Kīlauea emits 2,000–4,000 tons of sulfur dioxide (SO2) every day.

==Description==
Vog is created when volcanic gases (primarily oxides of sulfur) react with sunlight, oxygen and moisture. The result includes sulfuric acid and other sulfates. Vog is made up of a mixture of gases and aerosols which makes it hard to study and potentially more dangerous than either on their own.

Vog, which originates from volcanic vents, differs from laze, created when lava enters the ocean.


==Vog in Hawaii==
In Hawaii, the gas plumes of Kīlauea rise up from three locations: Halemaʻumaʻu, Puʻu ʻŌʻō, and from along the coastline where lava flows from the East Rift zone enter the ocean. The plumes create a blanket of vog that can envelop the island. Vog mostly affects the Kona coast on the west side of the Island of Hawaii, where the prevailing trade winds blow the vog to the southwest and southern winds then blow it north up the Kohala coast.

Prolonged periods of southerly Kona winds, however, can cause vog to affect the eastern side of the Island on rare occasions, and affect islands across the entire state as well. By the time the vog reaches other islands, the sulfur dioxide has largely dissipated, leaving behind ash, smoke, sulfates, and ammonia.

During the 2016 volcanic events at Kīlauea, the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, in collaboration with other agencies, published a vog dashboard so community members could track the vog.

==Comparing vog and smog==

Vog and smog are different. Vog is formed when sulfur oxides emitted by a volcano react with moisture to form an aerosol. The aerosol scatters light, thus making the vog visible. Smog is formed largely from the incomplete combustion of fuel, reacting with nitrogen oxides and ozone produced from carbon monoxide by reactions with sunlight. The result is also a visible aerosol.

When smog levels are high, the sky appears yellowish-grey because nitrogen oxides are yellow. In contrast, sulfur oxides are colorless and vog looks grey. Once the vog layer dissipates, grey spots of vog in the sky may, for a time, remain trapped in the inversion layer.

Several chemicals emitted from cars are not emitted from volcanoes. Similarly, some chemicals emitted from volcanoes, such as hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride, are not created by exhaust gas. Moreover, smog generated by factories has its own unique mix of contaminants.

==Health hazards==
Most studies of vog have been in areas where vog is naturally present and not in controlled conditions. Vog contains chemicals that can damage the environment and the health of plants, humans and other animals. Most of the aerosols are acidic and of a size where they can remain in the lungs to damage the lungs and impair function. Headaches, watery eyes, sore throat, breathing difficulties (including inducing asthma attacks), flu-like symptoms and general lethargy are commonly reported. These effects are especially pronounced in children and in people with respiratory conditions. Vog generally reduces visibility, creating a hazard for road, air and ocean traffic.

The long-term health effects of vog are unknown.

==Recent events==
Several studies are underway to measure the air quality near volcanoes more carefully.
Sulfur dioxide emissions increased on March 12, 2008, when a new vent opened. The increased vog level has caused evacuations and damaged crops. In the summer of 2008 and in 2012, the County of Hawaii received a disaster designation due to the agricultural damage.

A recent multi-year computer-modeling feasibility study, known as VMAP, designed to predict the location and concentrations of vog from Kīlauea was conducted by the University of Hawaii.

<text>The Krashovani (, ) are a Croat community inhabiting Carașova and Lupac in the Caraș-Severin County within Romanian Banat. They are Catholic by faith and speak a Torlakian dialect.

==Names==

In Romanian, they are commonly known as &quot;Carașoveni&quot;; other variants include &quot;Carșoveni&quot;, &quot;Cârșoveni&quot;, &quot;Cotcoreți&quot; or &quot;Cocoși&quot;. In Croatian, they are commonly known as &quot;Krašovani&quot;; other variants include &quot;Karašovani&quot;, &quot;Krašovanje&quot;, &quot;Karaševci&quot; and &quot;Koroševci&quot;.

==Settlements==
Krashovani, declared as Croats, form a majority in two communes of Caraș-Severin County: Carașova and Lupac.

*Carașova commune
**Carașova (Karaševo)
**Nermed (Neremić)
**Iabalcea (Jabalče)
*Lupac commune
**Clocotici (Klokotič)
**Rafnic (Ravnik)
**Vodnic (Vodnik)
**Lupac (Lupak)

==Identity==
The Krashovani are adhere to the Catholic Church and identify their language as Croatian. Their dialect is regarded a sub-dialect of the Torlak dialect, a transitional dialect spoken in southeastern Serbia, westernmost Bulgaria and northeastern Macedonia.

According to the 2002 census in Romania, the population of the Carașova commune comprised 84.60% Croats, 4.96% others, 4.47% Roma, 4.41% Romanians and others. 93.12% of the population in that commune declared their mother tongue as Croatian. Only 207 persons declared Krashovani ethnicity in the 2002 census.

==History==
Their ancestors first settled Carașova in the 13th and 14th centuries from northwestern Bosnia. They formed a community in the northern plateau of the Caraș river, in seven villages, the oldest, Carașova, being mentioned in the 13th and 14th centuries while the rest are first mentioned in the 17th century.

Serbian ethnographer Jovan Cvijić concluded that the community was &quot;very old settlers with origin in Crna Reka who were Catholicised&quot;; Stanko Žuljić claims that their origin is in Turopolje, in Croatia.

The Carașoveni were considered Bulgarians by some Bulgarian scientists in the first half of the 20th century (such as G. Cibrus, M. Mladenov, K. Telbizov, and T. Balkanski), partially based on their view that Torlakian-speakers are ethnically Bulgarians.

According to the Austrian population census there were over 10,000 Carașoveni in Banat. In the 1847 census over 10,000 people declared as Carașoveni. In 1896 the Austro-Hungarian census around 7,500 Carașoveni were listed. The same was stated by the authorities of the Kingdom of Romania in 1940. Their number dropped to 2,775 in 1992.

The Union of Croats of Romania (, ZHR; , UCR) is an ethnic minority political party in Romania representing the Croatian community.

<doc id="1078824" wikidata="Q951164" url="?curid=1078824" title="Doug Williams (quarterback)">
<text>Douglas Lee Williams (born August 9, 1955) is an American professional football executive and former quarterback and coach who is a senior advisor for the Washington Commanders of the National Football League (NFL). Williams was the first black quarterback to both start and win a Super Bowl, doing so with Washington in Super Bowl XXII when they were known as the Redskins. He was named Super Bowl MVP after throwing four touchdowns in a single quarter.

Following his playing career, Williams began coaching, most notably serving as the head coach of the Grambling State Tigers. Following that, Williams has been a team executive for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Virginia Destroyers, and Commanders.

==College career==
Williams played quarterback for the Grambling State Tigers from 1974 to 1977. In his first two seasons, he played on the same team as future NFL receiver Sammy White. Williams guided the Tigers to a 36–7 (.837 winning percentage) record as a four-year starter, and led the Tigers to three Southwestern Athletic Conference Championships. Williams was named Black College Player of the Year twice.

In 1977, Williams led the NCAA in several categories, including total yards from scrimmage (3,249), passing yards (3,286), touchdown passes (38), and yards per play (8.6). Williams finished fourth in the Heisman Trophy voting, behind Earl Campbell, Terry Miller, and Ken MacAfee. Williams graduated from Grambling with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education, and began student teaching while working on his master&#x27;s degree before the 1978 NFL draft.

Despite the success that he enjoyed on the field, Tampa Bay Buccaneers offensive coordinator Joe Gibbs was the only NFL coach who visited Williams to work him out and scout him. Gibbs spent two days with the , quarterback, reviewing play books, film, and going through passing drills. Impressed by his poise, work ethic, and studious nature, Gibbs rated Williams as the best quarterback in the draft, writing in his scouting report that Williams had &quot;a big-time arm with perfect passing mechanics&quot; and was &quot;a natural leader...very academic and extremely prepared...football smart,&quot; and recommended that the Buccaneers select Williams with their first-round draft choice.

==Professional career==
===Tampa Bay Buccaneers===
Following the recommendation of Gibbs, Tampa Bay drafted Williams in the first round (17th overall) of the 1978 NFL draft. Williams became the first African-American quarterback taken in the first round of an NFL draft. His first preseason pass, a 75-yard incompletion that sailed 10 yards past receiver Isaac Hagins, drew a standing ovation from the Tampa Stadium crowd. He was the first quarterback in Buccaneer history capable of throwing long passes downfield. In a 1979 game against the Chicago Bears, Williams and Bears quarterback Vince Evans made history by making it the first NFL game ever to have a black starting quarterback on both teams. Tampa Bay, which had won just two games in the first two years of the franchise, went to the playoffs three times in five seasons with Williams as starter and played in the 1979 NFC Championship game. During his time in Tampa Bay, Williams improved his completion percentage each season.

Williams was the only starting African-American quarterback in the NFL at that time, and dealt with racism from the fans, and even his own coaching staff. In his book &quot;Rise of the Black QB&quot;, author Jason Reid cited an incident in the 1978 Tampa Bay training camp, in which quarterbacks coach Bill Nelsen began berating Williams in what was described as going beyond coaching and becoming a personal attack. &quot;I think Coach Gibbs knew that it wasn&#x27;t a matter of being coached hard,&quot; recalled Williams. &quot;I mean, I played for Eddie Robinson at Grambling, so he &quot;knew&quot; I could handle that. But he (Gibbs) immediately sensed that something else was going on.&quot; Gibbs, who was at the opposite end of the field, sprinted over to Nelsen and confronted him. Gibbs threw his clipboard down, pointed his finger in Nelsen&#x27;s face and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you ever talk to him like that again! Is that clear?&quot; According to Williams, Nelsen never confronted Williams in that manner again.

During his tenure with the Buccaneers, Williams was paid $120,000 a year, the lowest salary for a starting quarterback in the league and less than the salary of 12 backups. After the 1982 season, Williams asked for a $600,000 contract. Bucs owner Hugh Culverhouse refused to budge from his initial offer of $400,000 despite protests from coach John McKay. Feeling that Culverhouse was not paying him what an NFL starter should earn, Williams sat out the 1983 season. That year, the Bucs went 2–14, and did not make the playoffs again until the 1997 season 14 years later. Tampa Bay lost ten games in every season but one in that stretch, including 12 in a row from 1983 to 1994. Culverhouse&#x27;s willingness to let Williams walk away over such a relatively small amount of money was seen as insensitive, especially as it came only months after Williams&#x27; wife Janice died of an aneurysm.

===Oklahoma / Arizona Outlaws===
After a year away from football, Williams signed with the Oklahoma Outlaws of the upstart United States Football League. The Outlaws briefly called Hall of Fame coach and quarterback guru Sid Gillman out of retirement as director of football operations, and Williams was Gillman&#x27;s highest-profile signing. Williams signed a $3 million contract with a $1 million signing bonus, making him easily one of the highest-paid players in all of football. Years later, he recalled that he was won over when Outlaws owners William Tatham Sr. and Bill Tatham Jr. &quot;treated me as a human,&quot; rather than &quot;a piece of cattle in a stockyard.&quot;

In 1984, Williams led the Outlaws of the USFL in passing, completing 261 out of 528 passes for 3,084 yards and 15 touchdowns. However, he threw 21 interceptions, ending up with a passer rating of 60.5 during a 6–12 season. In 1985, the team moved to Arizona and merged with the Arizona Wranglers to become the Arizona Outlaws. Williams showed some improvement, completing 271 out of 509 passes for 3,673 yards with 21 touchdowns and 17 interceptions.

===Washington Redskins===

After the USFL was shut down in 1986, Williams returned to the NFL, joining the Washington Redskins. He was reunited with his former offensive coordinator, Joe Gibbs, who was now the team&#x27;s head coach. Initially, Williams served as the backup for starting quarterback Jay Schroeder, but after Schroeder became injured, Williams stepped in and led the Redskins to an opening-day victory against the Philadelphia Eagles in the 1987 season. Williams and Schroeder had a somewhat chilly relationship, stemming from Schroeder ordering Williams to get off the field when the Redskins thought Schroeder had been injured in the 1986 NFC title game and sent Williams in to substitute for him. It would be one of three times in 1987 that Williams substituted for Schroeder and led the team to victory (the other two were November 15 against Detroit and December 26 at Minnesota). Williams only started two games, September 20 at Atlanta and November 23 against the Rams. While both starts were losses, at the end of the season, when the Redskins had qualified for the playoffs, Williams, with his 94.0 passer rating, was chosen as the starter. He led the team to Super Bowl XXII in which they routed the Denver Broncos, becoming the first black quarterback to both play in and win a Super Bowl.

According to legend, Williams was asked this question on Media Day: &quot;How long have you been a black quarterback?&quot; He supposedly replied, &quot;I&#x27;ve been a quarterback since high school, and I&#x27;ve been black all my life.&quot; On February 1, 2013, Williams was interviewed on the Boomer and Carton show, and he was asked by the host Craig Carton if the question ever happened. He replied that it was true. Williams said he thought the reporter was a little nervous and the question may have come out the wrong way and that no ill will was meant towards him.
On the day before Super Bowl XXII, Williams had a six-hour root canal surgery performed to repair a dental bridge abscess. On January 31, 1988, he engineered a 42–10 rout over the Broncos, who were led by quarterback John Elway. Williams completed 18 of 29 passes for 340 yards with four touchdown passes. All four touchdowns were thrown in the second quarter, which set a Super Bowl record for most touchdowns thrown in a single half, let alone a quarter. It was part of a 35-point second quarter that put the game out of reach. He was named Super Bowl MVP for his efforts, making him the first African-American quarterback to both win a Super Bowl and be named its MVP. He broke the Super Bowl single-game record of 331 passing yards set in 1985 by Joe Montana, who broke Williams&#x27; record the following year with 357. Williams tied the Super Bowl single-game record for passing touchdowns set by Terry Bradshaw in 1979, which Montana surpassed with five in Super Bowl XXIV. Williams&#x27; 80-yard scoring pass to Ricky Sanders tied the Super Bowl record for the longest pass, set by Jim Plunkett&#x27;s throw to Kenny King in 1981; it was broken in 1997 by Brett Favre&#x27;s 81-yard pass to Antonio Freeman for the longest Super Bowl play from scrimmage.

Williams suffered from injuries the following season and was outplayed by Mark Rypien, who eventually won the starting job. Despite competing for the same starting job, Williams and Rypien were so supportive of each other that T-shirts were sold with the caption &quot;United We Stand&quot;, depicting the two quarterbacks as cartoon characters with Williams saying &quot;I&#x27;m for Mark&quot; and Rypien saying &quot;I&#x27;m for Doug&quot;. Williams would play one final season in 1989, as Rypien&#x27;s backup, during the latter&#x27;s first Pro Bowl season.

Finances played a large part in Williams&#x27; departure from the Redskins, with Williams slated to make $1 million in 1990 as the team&#x27;s backup quarterback. The Redskins were able to sign former New York Giants quarterback Jeff Rutledge for the backup role for substantially less money, making Williams expendable. Williams received scant attention from other teams following his waiver by the Redskins – a situation which he flatly attributed to racism. Williams retired with a 5–9 record as Redskins starter (8–9, counting playoffs) and a 38–42–1 record as a regular season starter (42–45–1, including 7 playoff starts). He had 100 passing touchdowns, and 15 rushing touchdowns, in 88 NFL games.

==Coaching and executive career==

Following his departure from the NFL, Williams worked on television in 1990 as a college football analyst for Black Entertainment Television (BET). Despite enjoying the change of pace, Williams longed to return to football and when a high school head coaching position opened up in 1991 at the new Pointe Coupee Central High School in the unincorporated Labarre area of Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana, Williams applied for the job and was hired for the position. Williams led the 35-player team to a 5–5 record in the season, including an upset of the second-ranked school in the state.

In 1992, Williams was able to move on to coach at his former high school in Zachary, now renamed Northeast High. Playing its home games on a field bearing his name, Williams was able to lead the team to an undefeated regular season, finally falling in the state semi-finals. During the 1993 Louisiana HS playoffs, his team notably knocked out Isidore Newman High School, then led by senior quarterback Peyton Manning.

Williams moved to the collegiate coaching ranks in 1994, when he was hired as the running backs coach for the football team of the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. He worked as offensive coordinator for the Scottish Claymores of the World League of American Football early in 1995 and as a scout for the NFL&#x27;s Jacksonville Jaguars during the 1995 NFL season.

Williams began his collegiate head coaching career at Morehouse College in 1997. He was named the head football coach at Grambling State University in 1998, succeeding the legendary Eddie Robinson. He led the Tigers to three consecutive Southwestern Athletic Conference titles from 2000 to 2002, before leaving to rejoin the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as a personnel executive.

At the conclusion of Super Bowl XLII, on the 20th anniversary of being named Super Bowl XXII MVP, Williams carried the Vince Lombardi trophy on to the field for presentation to the winning New York Giants. Williams was named the director of professional scouting for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in February 2009. He was relieved of this position on May 11, 2010.

Williams was subsequently hired as general manager of the Norfolk expansion franchise in the United Football League, now known as the Virginia Destroyers. On February 21, 2011, Williams resigned from the Destroyers to begin his second stint as the head football coach at Grambling State University. He was fired from this position on September 11, 2013.

In February 2014, Williams rejoined the Redskins as a personnel executive. The hiring marked Williams&#x27; return to the Redskins. Williams was promoted to the position of Senior Vice President of Player Personnel in June 2017. In 2020, following a front office restructure after the hiring of Ron Rivera as head coach, Williams was named the team&#x27;s senior vice president of player development. The following year he became a senior advisor to team president Jason Wright.

==Personal life==

Williams was born in Zachary, Louisiana, a town of about 8,000 people located near Baton Rouge. Williams and his third wife, Raunda, have eight children: Laura, Lee, Ashley, Adrian, Doug Jr., Jasmine, Temessia, and Carmaleta. His sons Adrian and Doug Jr. (D.J.) are both accomplished collegiate athletes. Adrian played basketball for Brown University until graduating after the 2010–11 season while D.J. signed to play for his father at Grambling State University. His daughter Laura has committed to playing basketball at University of Southern California for the 2024–2025 season. Doug&#x27;s nephew Johnny Huggins also played in the NFL.

In 2009, Williams and fellow Grambling State alumnus James Harris co-founded the Black College Football Hall of Fame. Each year, several notable football players from historically black colleges and universities are entered in its hall of fame at an induction ceremony in Atlanta. In July 2019, Grambling State honored Williams by naming a street in his honor on the college&#x27;s campus.

<text>SS &quot;Conte di Savoia&quot; (&quot;Count of Savoy&quot;) was an Italian ocean liner built in 1932 at the Cantieri Riuniti dell&#x27;Adriatico, Trieste.

&quot;Conte di Savoia&quot; was originally ordered for the Lloyd Sabaudo line; however, after a merger with the Navigazione Generale Italiana, the ship was completed for the newly formed Italia Flotte Riunite. The new Italia Line also controlled , a similar though slightly larger ship completed just two months before &quot;Conte di Savoia&quot;. The &quot;Conte di Savoia&quot; was more modern in decoration and appearance than &quot;Rex&quot; and was the first major liner fitted with gyroscopic stabilizers.

==History==
In November 1932, she made her maiden voyage to New York. Unlike &quot;Rex&quot;, she never made a record transatlantic crossing, reaching a best speed of in 1933.

&quot;Conte di Savoia&quot; had one unusual feature designed to increase passenger numbers. Three huge anti-rolling gyroscopes were fitted low down in a forward hold. These rotated at high revolutions and were designed to mitigate rolling - a persistent problem on the rough North Atlantic crossing that affected all shipping lines. In practice they reduced the rolling by slowing down the rolling period, but they also caused the vessel to &quot;hang&quot; annoyingly when the vessel was on the extreme limit of her rolls. For safety reasons the system was quickly abandoned on eastbound crossings where the prevailing weather produced following seas, although it was still used on westbound crossings. This was because with a following sea (and the deep slow rolls this generated) the vessel tended to &#x27;hang&#x27; with the system turned on, and the inertia it generated made it harder for the vessel to right herself from heavy rolls. None of this affected the operation of the shipping line&#x27;s advertising department and the benefits of a &quot;smooth crossing&quot; were heavily promoted during the life of the ship.

In 1931, Italian architect, Melchiorre Bega was selected to design the interior lay-out and furnishings of the Conte di Savoia. Bega, who was well-known for his innovative designs of stores, cafés and hotels, created a modernist interior. 
&quot;Conte di Savoia&quot; was requisitioned for war service in 1940, and was sunk in 1943. The hulk was refloated in 1945 and later scrapped in 1950.

<doc id="1078828" wikidata="Q2268608" url="?curid=1078828" title="Dextropropoxyphene">
<text>Dextropropoxyphene is an analgesic in the opioid category, patented in 1955 and manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company. It is an optical isomer of levopropoxyphene. It is intended to treat mild pain and also has antitussive (cough suppressant) and local anaesthetic effects. The drug has been taken off the market in Europe and the US due to concerns of fatal overdoses and heart arrhythmias. It is still available in Australia, albeit with restrictions after an application by its manufacturer to review its proposed banning. Its onset of analgesia (pain relief) is said to be 20–30 minutes and peak effects are seen about 1.5–2.0 hours after oral administration.

Dextropropoxyphene is sometimes combined with acetaminophen. Trade names include Darvocet-N, Di-Gesic, and Darvon with APAP (for dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol). The British approved name (i.e. the generic name of the active ingredient) of the paracetamol/dextropropoxyphene preparation is co-proxamol (sold under a variety of brand names); however, it has been withdrawn since 2007, and is no longer available to new patients, with exceptions. The paracetamol combination(s) are known as Capadex or Di-Gesic in Australia, Lentogesic in South Africa, and Di-Antalvic in France (unlike co-proxamol, which is an approved name, these are all brand names).

Dextropropoxyphene is known under several synonyms, including:
* Alpha-d-4-dimethylamino-3-methyl-1,2-diphenyl-2-butanol propionate
* [(2&quot;S&quot;,3&quot;R&quot;)-4-(Dimethylamino)-3- methyl-1,2-diphenylbutan-2-yl] propanoate
* (+)-1,2-Diphenyl-2-propionoxy- 3-methyl-4-di-methylaminobutane
* Desoxypropiophen

==Uses==

===Analgesia===
Dextropropoxyphene is generally considered a weak analgesic, with several studies finding its efficacy is no better than acetaminophen.
Like codeine, it is a weak opioid. However, dextropropoxyphene has one-third to one-half of the analgesic activity of codeine.

===Restless legs syndrome===
Dextropropoxyphene has been found to be helpful in relieving the symptoms of restless legs syndrome.

===Contraindications===
Dextropropoxyphene is contraindicated in patients allergic to paracetamol (acetaminophen) or dextropropoxyphene, and in alcoholics. It is not intended for use in patients who are prone to suicide, anxiety, panic, or addiction.

===Side effects===
Severe toxicity can occur with small increments above the therapeutic dose including cardiotoxicity, and fatal overdoses. This is especially true when the drug is combined with alcohol.
Other side effects include:
*Constipation
*Itching
*Drowsiness
*Nausea
*Sensorineural deafness

== Pharmacology ==

Dextropropoxyphene acts as a mu-opioid receptor agonist. It also acts as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, as well as a weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

==Toxicity==
Overdose is commonly broken into two categories - liver toxicity (from paracetamol poisoning) and dextropropoxyphene overdose.

An overdose of dextropropoxyphene may lead to various systemic effects. Excessive opioid receptor stimulation is responsible for the CNS depression, respiratory depression, aspiration pneumonia, miosis, and gastrointestinal effects seen in propoxyphene poisoning. It may also account for mood- or thought-altering effects. In the presence of amphetamine, propoxyphene overdose increases CNS stimulation and may cause fatal convulsive seizures.

In addition, both propoxyphene and its metabolite norpropoxyphene have local anesthetic effects at concentrations about 10 times those necessary for opioid effects. Norpropoxyphene is a more potent local anesthetic than propoxyphene, and they are both more potent than lidocaine. Local anesthetic activity appears to be responsible for the arrhythmias and cardiovascular depression seen in propoxyphene poisoning.

Both propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene are potent blockers of cardiac membrane sodium channels, and are more potent than lidocaine, quinidine, and procainamide in this respect. As a result, propoxyphene and norpropoxyphene appear to have the characteristics of a Vaughn-Williams Class Ic antiarrhythmic.

These direct cardiac effects include decreased heart rate (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased contractility, and decreased electrical conductivity (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects appear to be due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by naloxone. Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and sodium bicarbonate therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS dysrhythmia.

Seizures may result from either opioid or local anesthetic effects. Pulmonary edema may result from direct pulmonary toxicity, neurogenic/anoxic effects, or cardiovascular depression.

Balance disorder is possible, with risk of falls from standing height.

==Available forms==
Propoxyphene was initially introduced as propoxyphene hydrochloride. Shortly before the patent on propoxyphene expired, propoxyphene napsylate form was introduced to the market. The napsylate salt (the salt of naphthalene-2-sulfonic acid) is claimed to be less prone to non-medical use, because it is almost insoluble in water, so cannot be used for injection. Napsylate also gives lower peak blood level. Because of different molar mass, a dose of 100 mg of propoxyphene napsylate is required to supply an amount of propoxyphene equivalent to that present in 65 mg of propoxyphene hydrochloride.

Before the FDA-directed recall, dextropropoxyphene HCl was available in the United States as a prescription formulation with paracetamol (acetaminophen) in ratio from 30 mg / 600 mg to 100 mg / 650 mg (or 100 mg / 325 mg in the case of Balacet), respectively. These are usually named Darvocet. Darvon is a pure propoxyphene preparation that does not contain paracetamol.

In Australia, dextropropoxyphene is available on prescription, both as a combined product (32.5 mg dextropropoxyphene per 325 mg paracetamol branded as Di-gesic, Capadex, or Paradex; it is also available in pure form (100 mg capsules) known as Doloxene, however its use has been restricted.

==Drug testing==
Detectable levels of propoxyphene/dextropropoxyphene may stay in a person&#x27;s system for up to 9 days after last dose and can be tested for specifically in nonstandard urinalysis, but may remain in the body longer in minuscule amounts. Propoxyphene does not show up on standard opiate/opioid tests because it is not chemically related to opiates as part of the OPI or OPI 2000 panels, which detect morphine and related compounds. It is most closely related to methadone.

== History ==
Dextropropoxyphene was successfully tested in 1954 as part of US Navy and CIA-funded research on nonaddictive substitutes for codeine.

== Use in organic synthesis ==
Without the propionyl group on the oxygen, the non-esterified alcohol precursor of propoxyphene (both enantiomers, known as darvon alcohol and novrad alcohol) have been employed as stoichiometric chiral reagents for asymmetric carbonyl reduction reactions involving aluminium hydride reagents.

==Usage controversy and regulation==
Dextropropoxyphene is subject to some controversy; while many physicians prescribe it for a wide range of mildly to moderately painful symptoms, as well as for treatment of diarrhea, many others refuse to prescribe it, citing limited effectiveness. In addition, the therapeutic index of dextroproxyphene is relatively narrow.

Caution should be used when administering dextropropoxyphene, particularly with children and the elderly and with patients who may be pregnant or breastfeeding; other reported problems include kidney, liver, or respiratory disorders, and prolonged use. Attention should be paid to concomitant use with tranquillizers, antidepressants, or excess alcohol.

Darvon, a dextropropoxyphene formulation made by Eli Lilly, which had been on the market for 25 years, came under heavy fire in 1978 by consumer groups that said it was associated with suicide. Darvon was never withdrawn from the market, until recently, but Lilly has waged a sweeping, and largely successful, campaign among doctors, pharmacists, and Darvon users to defend the drug as safe when it is used in proper doses and not mixed with alcohol. After determining the risks outweigh the benefits, the USFDA requested physicians stop prescribing the drug. On November 19, 2010, the FDA announced that Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals agreed to withdraw Darvon and Darvocet in the United States, followed by manufacturers of dextropropoxyphene.

===Australia===
In Australia, both pure dextropropoxyphene capsules (as napsylate, 100 mg), marketed as Doloxene, and combination tablets and capsules (with paracetamol) all containing 32.5 mg dextropropoxyphene HCl with 325 mg paracetamol, which are currently available on prescription were supposed to be withdrawn from 1 March 2012, but Aspen Pharma sought a review in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which ruled in 2013 that the drugs could be sold under strict conditions.

===Canada===
On December 1, 2010, Health Canada and Paladin Labs Inc. announced the voluntary recall and withdrawal of Darvon-N from the Canadian market and the discontinuation of sale of Darvon-N.

=== European Union ===
In November 2007, the European Commission requested the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to review the safety and effectiveness of dextropropoxyphene based medicines and on 25 June 2009 the EMA recommended a gradual withdrawal throughout the European Union. The EMA&#x27;s conclusion was based on evidence that dextropropoxyphene-containing medicines were weak painkillers, the combination of dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol was no more effective than paracetamol on its own, and the difference between the dose needed for treatment and a harmful dose (the &quot;therapeutic index&quot;) was too small.

=== New Zealand ===
In February 2010, Medsafe announced Paradex and Capadex (forms of dextropropoxyphene) were being withdrawn from the marketplace due to health issues, and withdrawal in other countries.

===India===
On June 12, 2013, the Indian government suspended the manufacture, sale, and distribution of the drug under Section 26A of the 1940 Drugs and Cosmetic Act.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, physicians had long been discouraged by the medical products agency to prescribe dextropropoxyphene due to the risk of respiratory depression and even death when taken with alcohol. Physicians had earlier been recommended to prescribe products with only dextropropoxyphene and not to patients with a history of substance use disorder, depression, or suicidal tendencies. Products with mixed active ingredients were taken off the market and only products with dextropropoxyphene were allowed to be sold. Dextropoxyphene was &quot;de facto narcotica&quot; labelled.

As of March 2011, all products containing the substance are withdrawn because of safety issues after a European Commission decision.

At the time, people who drank excessive amounts of alcohol and other substances and take combination dextropoxyphene / acetaminophen (paracetamol) were discussed as needing to take many combination tablets to reach euphoria, because the amount of dextropropoxyphene per tablet is relatively low (30–40 mg). The ingested paracetamol—the other component—may then reach liver toxic levels. In the case of alcoholics, who often already have damaged livers, even a relatively small overdose with paracetamol may produce hepatotoxicity, liver failure, and necrosis. This toxicity with the combination of overdosed dextroproxyphene (with its CNS/respiratory depression/vomit with risk for aspiration pneumonia, as well as cardiotoxicity) and paracetamol-induced liver damage can result in death.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, preparations containing only dextropropoxyphene were discontinued in 2004. In 2007, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency removed the licence for co-proxamol, also called distalgesic. From then on in the UK, co-proxamol is only available on a named patient basis, for long-term chronic pain and only to those who have already been prescribed this medicine. Its withdrawal from the UK market is a result of concerns relating to its toxicity in overdose (even small overdoses can be fatal), and dangerous reaction with alcohol. Recreational use in the UK is uncommon. Many patients have been prescribed alternative combinations of drugs as a replacement.

The motivation for the withdrawal of co-proxamol was the reduction in suicides and a key part of the agency&#x27;s justification of its decision was based upon studies showing co-proxamol was no more effective than paracetamol alone in pain management.

The co-proxamol preparations available in the UK contained a subtherapeutic dose of paracetamol, 325 mg per tablet. Patients were warned not to take more than eight tablets in one day, a total dose of 2600 mg paracetamol per day. Despite this reduced level, patients were still at a high risk of overdose; coproxamol was second only to tricyclic antidepressants as the most common prescription drugs used in overdose. Following the reduction in prescribing in 2005–2007, prior to its complete withdrawal, the number of deaths associated with the drug dropped significantly. Additionally, patients have not substituted other drugs as a method of overdose.

The decision to withdraw co-proxamol has met with some controversy; it has been brought up in the House of Commons on two occasions, 13 July 2005 and on 17 January 2007. Patients have found alternatives to co-proxamol either too strong, too weak, or with intolerable side effects. During the House of Commons debates, it is quoted that originally some 1,700,000 patients in the UK were prescribed co-proxamol. Following the phased withdrawal, this has eventually been reduced to 70,000. However, this apparently is the residual pool of patients who cannot find alternate analgesia to co-proxamol.

The safety net of prescribing co-proxamol after license withdrawal from 31 December 2007, on a &quot;named patient&quot; basis where doctors agree a clinical need exists, has been rejected by most UK doctors because the wording that &quot;responsibility will fall on the prescriber&quot; is unacceptable to most doctors. Some patients intend to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights. However, the European Medicines Agency has recently backed the agency&#x27;s decision, and recommended in June 2009 that propoxyphene preparations be withdrawn across the European Union.

On 28 March 2017, NHS Clinical Commissioners announced that co-proxamol will be no longer available under NHS England as part of £400m of spending cuts for prescriptions that are believed to have little or no clinical value.

===United States===
In January 2009, an FDA advisory committee voted 14 to 12 against the continued marketing of propoxyphene products, based on its weak pain-killing abilities, addictiveness, association with drug deaths and possible heart problems, including arrhythmia. A subsequent re-evaluation resulted in a July 2009 recommendation to strengthen the boxed warning for propoxyphene to reflect the risk of overdose. Dextropropoxyphene subsequently carried a black box warning in the U.S., stating:

Propoxyphene should be used with extreme caution, if at all, in patients who have a history of substance/drug/alcohol abuse, depression with suicidal tendency, or who already take medications that cause drowsiness (e.g., antidepressants, muscle relaxants, pain relievers, sedatives, tranquilizers). Fatalities have occurred in such patients when propoxyphene was misused.

Because of potential for side effects, this drug is on the list for high-risk medications in the elderly.

On November 19, 2010, the FDA requested manufacturers withdraw propoxyphene from the US market, citing heart arrhythmia in patients who took the drug at typical doses. Tramadol, which lacks the cardiotoxicity, has been recommended instead of propoxyphene, as it is also indicated for mild to moderate pain, and is less likely to be misused or cause addiction than other opioids.

== In Popular Culture ==
In the Stephen King short story collection &quot;Night Shift&quot;, the final story of the book, &quot;The Woman in the Room&quot;, tells a tale in which the main character contemplates and then finally performs a mercy killing using a drug called &quot;Darvon Complex.&quot;

==Use by right-to-die societies==
High toxicity and relatively easy availability made propoxyphene a drug of choice for right-to-die societies. It is listed in Dr. Philip Nitschke&#x27;s &quot;The Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot; and Dr. Pieter Admiraal&#x27;s &quot;Guide to a Humane Self-Chosen Death&quot;. &quot;With the withdrawal of the barbiturate sleeping tablets from the medical prescribing list, propoxyphene has become the most common doctor-prescribed medication used by seriously ill people to end their lives.&quot;

<text>Astor Place is a street in NoHo/East Village, in the lower part of the New York City borough of Manhattan. It is divided into two sections: One segment runs from Broadway in the west (just below East 8th Street) to Lafayette Street, and the other runs from Fourth to Third Avenues. The street encompasses two plazas at the intersection with Cooper Square, Lafayette Street, Fourth Avenue, and Eighth Street – Alamo Plaza and Astor Place Station Plaza. &quot;Astor Place&quot; is also sometimes used for the neighborhood around the street. It was named for John Jacob Astor (at one time the richest person in the United States), soon after his death in 1848. A $21 million reconstruction to implement a redesign of Astor Place began in 2013 and was completed in 2016.

==Geography==
The &quot;American Guide Series&quot; describes the Astor Place district as running from Houston Street north to 14th Street, between Broadway and Third Avenue. &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; defines the neighborhood as between 4th Street and 8th Street, from Broadway to Third Avenue.

==History==
Astor Place was originally a powwow point for the various Lenape tribes of Manhattan and was called Kintecoying or, &quot;Crossroads of Three Nations&quot;.

Astor Place was once known as Art Street. From 1767 through 1859, Vauxhall Gardens, a country resort, was located on this street. The area belonged to John Jacob Astor, and Astor Place was renamed after him soon after his death, in 1848. In 1826, he carved out an upper-class neighborhood from the site with Lafayette Street bisecting eastern gardens from western homes. Wealthy New Yorkers, including Astor and other members of the family, built mansions along this central thoroughfare. Astor built the Astor Library in the eastern portion of the neighborhood as a donation to the city. Architect Seth Geer designed row houses called LaGrange Terrace for the development, and the area became a fashionable, upper-class residential district. This location made the gardens accessible to the people of both the Broadway and Bowery districts.

Astor Place was the site of the Astor Opera House, at the intersection of Astor Place, East 8th Street, and Lafayette Street. Built to be &quot;the&quot; fashionable theater in 1847, it was the site of the Astor Place Riot of May 10, 1849. Anti-British feelings were running so high among New York&#x27;s Irish at the height of the Great Famine that they found an outlet in the rivalry between American actor Edwin Forrest and the English William Charles Macready, who were both presenting versions of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in nearby theatres. The protest in the streets against Macready became so violent that the police fired into the crowd. At least 18 died, and hundreds were injured. The theater itself never recovered from the association with the riot and was closed down shortly afterwards. The interior was demolished, and the building was turned over to the use of the New York Mercantile Library.

From 1852 until 1936, Astor Place was the location of Bible House, headquarters of the American Bible Society.

In the mid- to late-19th century, the area was home to many of the wealthiest New Yorkers, including members of the Astor, Vanderbilt, and Delano families. Editor and poet William Cullen Bryant, and inventor and entrepreneur Isaac Singer lived in the neighborhood in the 1880s. By the turn of the century, however, warehouses and manufacturing firms moved in, the elite moved to places such as Murray Hill, and the area fell into disrepair. The neighborhood was revitalized beginning in the late 1960s and 1970s.

The New York City Department of Transportation&#x27;s &quot;Reconstruction of Astor Place and Cooper Square&quot; plan called for some changes to be made to Astor Place beginning in 2013. The street would end at Lafayette Street rather than continuing east to Third Avenue. This allowed the expansion of the &quot;Alamo Plaza&quot;, where the Alamo Cube is located, south to the southern sidewalk of Astor Place between Lafayette Street and Cooper Square, and the creation of an expanded sidewalk north of the Cooper Union Foundation Building. The Astor Place subway entrance plaza was also redesigned, and Fourth Avenue south of East 9th Street and the western part of Cooper Square was converted to be used by buses only, with a new pedestrian plaza created on Cooper Square between East 5th and 6th Streets. The traffic pattern of the area changed significantly, with Astor Place from Lafayette Street to Third Avenue becoming East Eighth Street eastbound, and the formerly bidirectional Cooper Square bus lane becoming northbound-only. The $16 million project was first proposed in 2008, then abandoned and re-proposed in 2011. Construction started in September 2013, and the work was completed in November 2016.

==Points of interest==
The current 299-seat Off-Broadway Astor Place Theatre, has been located in the landmark Colonnade Row on Lafayette Street, half a block south, since 1969. It was known for premiering works by downtown playwrights like Sam Shepard, but since 1991 has been the home of Blue Man Group, which now owns the theatre. The Joseph Papp Public Theater (home to the New York Shakespeare Festival) is located across the street in the former Astor Library building.

The trapezium-shaped traffic island in the center of Astor Place is a popular meeting place and center of much skateboarding activity. The island is most notably home to Tony Rosenthal&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Alamo&quot;, known popularly as &quot;The Cube&quot;, which consists of a large, black metal cube mounted on one corner. Installed in 1967 as part of the &quot;Sculpture and the Environment&quot; organized by the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, the Alamo Cube has since become a popular meeting place in the East Village. The sculpture can be spun on its vertical axis by one person with some effort, and two or more people without trouble. In 2003, the cube was the subject of a prank played by the ATF squad (All Too Flat) in which it was turned into a giant Rubik&#x27;s Cube. The members of the organization were careful with the prank, as they didn&#x27;t want to be destructive. The cube stayed up for about 24 hours before city maintenance removed the painted cardboard panels from the sculpture. On March 10, 2005, the Parks Department removed the Cube for maintenance. The original artist and crew replaced a missing bolt, and made a few other minor repairs. A makeshift replica of PVC tubes named the &quot;Jello Cube&quot; in honor of Peter Cooper was placed in its stead. As of November 2005, the Cube returned with a fresh coat of black paint, still able to spin.

Other nearby points of interest include:
* In 1860, Abraham Lincoln came to the attention of the fledgling Republican party with his Cooper Union Address. Given in The Cooper Union&#x27;s Great Hall, the &#x27;Right Makes Might&#x27; speech examined federal control of slavery and the thoughts of the signers of the Constitution. Cooper Union also housed one of the first free public libraries.
* One of the original libraries making up the New York Public Library, the Astor Library was housed in the Astor Library Building. The building is home today to Joseph Papp Public Theater.
* The Astor Place subway station () is among the original 28 subway stations, and is on the List of Registered Historic Places in New York. The tile mosaics on the station platform feature beavers, a tribute to John Jacob Astor, whose fortune was founded in beaver-pelt trading.
* The Peter Cooper Memorial by Augustus Saint Gaudens is one block south on Cooper Square.
* 21 Astor Place (also known as &quot;Clinton Hall&quot; and &quot;13 Astor Place&quot;) stands on the site which was once the Astor Opera House. After the Astor Place riot, the building was turned over to the New York Mercantile Library, which used it until 1890, when they tore it down and built the current 11-story building. The Library left in 1932, and the building became the headquarters for a union. It has now been redeveloped into modern condominiums behind the original 19th century façade, an example of the technique of facadism.
* The Cooper Station Post Office, built in the 1920s, is just three blocks north.
* The last Kmart in Manhattan was located in Astor Place before its closure in July 2021, in the space first created as a Wanaker&#x27;s department store. A Wegmans supermarket opened in the former Kmart space in October 2023.

==Transportation==
The IRT Lexington Avenue Line of the New York City Subway has a station named Astor Place at the intersection of Lafayette &amp; East 8th Streets, which is served by the .

No bus route serves the first block of Astor Place. The second block is used by the eastbound (westbound buses use East 9th Street) and the uptown out of service from Cooper Square, making their first stops at Third Avenue.

<text>Bouvard et Pécuchet () is an unfinished satirical novel by Gustave Flaubert, published in 1881 after his death in 1880.

== Background ==
Although it was conceived in 1863 as &quot;Les Deux Cloportes&quot; (&quot;The Two Woodlice&quot;), and partially inspired by a short story by Barthélemy Maurice (&quot;Les Deux Greffiers&quot;, &quot;The Two Court Clerks&quot;, which appeared in &quot;La Revue des Tribunaux&quot; in 1841 and which he may have read in 1858), Flaubert did not begin the work in earnest until 1872, at a time when financial ruin threatened. Over time, the book obsessed him to the degree that he claimed to have read over 1500 books in preparation for writing it—he intended it to be his masterpiece, surpassing all of his other works. He only took one minor break during its composition, in order to write &quot;Three Tales&quot; in 1875–76. Left unfinished at Flaubert&#x27;s death in 1880, &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot; was published the following year to lukewarm reviews: critics failed to appreciate both its message and its structural devices.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot; details the adventures of two Parisian copy-clerks, François Denys Bartholomée Bouvard and Juste Romain Cyrille Pécuchet, of the same age and nearly identical temperament. They meet one hot summer day in 1838 by the canal Saint-Martin and form an instant, symbiotic friendship. When Bouvard inherits a sizable fortune, the two decide to move to the countryside. They find a property near the town of Chavignolles in Normandy, between Caen and Falaise, and west of Rouen. Their search for intellectual stimulation leads them, over the course of years, to flounder through almost every branch of knowledge.

Flaubert uses their quest to expose the hidden weaknesses of the sciences and arts, as nearly every project Bouvard and Pécuchet set their minds on comes to grief. Their endeavours are interleaved with the story of their deteriorating relations with the local villagers; and the Revolution of 1848 is the occasion for much despondent discussion. The manuscript breaks off near the end of the novel. According to one set of Flaubert&#x27;s notes, the townsfolk, enraged by Bouvard and Pécuchet&#x27;s antics, try to force them out of the area, or have them committed. Disgusted with the world in general, Bouvard and Pécuchet ultimately decide to &quot;return to copying as before&quot; (&quot;copier comme autrefois&quot;), giving up their intellectual blundering. The work ends with their eager preparations to construct a two-seated desk on which to write.

This was originally intended to be followed by a large sample of what they copy out: possibly a &quot;sottisier&quot; (anthology of stupid quotations), the &quot;Dictionary of Received Ideas&quot; (encyclopedia of commonplace notions), or a combination of both.

== Structure ==
The work resembles the earlier &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; in that the plot structure is episodic, giving it a picaresque quality. Because Bouvard and Pécuchet rarely persevere with any subject beyond their first disappointments, they are perpetually rank beginners: the lack of real achievement and the constant forward movement through time (as shown through the rapid political changes from 1848 to 1851) create a strong sense of tension in the work.

==Major themes==

Nowhere does Flaubert&#x27;s exploration of the relation of signs to the objects they signify receive a more thorough treatment than in this work. Bouvard and Pécuchet systematically confuse signs and symbols with reality, an assumption that causes them much suffering, as it does for Emma Bovary and Frédéric Moreau. Yet here, due to the explicit focus on books and knowledge, Flaubert&#x27;s ideas reach a climax.

The relentless failure of Bouvard and Pécuchet to learn anything from their adventures raises the question of what is knowable. Whenever they achieve some small measure of success (a rare occurrence), it is the result of unknown external forces beyond their comprehension. In this sense, they strongly resemble Anthony in &quot;The Temptation of Saint Anthony&quot;, a work which addresses similar epistemological themes as they relate to classical literature. Lionel Trilling wrote that the novel expresses a belief in the alienation of human thought from human experience. The worldview that emerges from the work, one of human beings proceeding relentlessly forward without comprehending the results of their actions or the processes of the world around them, does not seem an optimistic one. But given that Bouvard and Pécuchet do gain some comprehension of humanity&#x27;s ignorant state (as demonstrated by their composition of the &quot;Dictionary of Received Ideas&quot;), it could be argued that Flaubert allows for the possibility of relative enlightenment.

In &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot;, Gustave Flaubert made fun of 18th- and 19th-century attempts to catalogue, classify, list, and record all of scientific and historical knowledge. In October 1872, he wrote, the novel is &quot;a kind of encyclopedia made into a farce... I am planning a thing in which I give vent to my anger... I shall vomit over my contemporaries the disgust they inspire in me... It will be big and violent.&quot; It is possible that the stress contributed to his death as he was drawing near to the close of the novel. Indeed, in 1874, he confessed to George Sand &quot;[it] is leading me very quietly, or rather relentlessly, to the abode of the shades. It will be the death of me!&quot;

==Literary significance and criticism==
Ezra Pound wrote &quot;Flaubert having recorded provincial customs in &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and city habits in the &quot;Sentimental Education&quot;, set out to complete his record of nineteenth century life by presenting all sorts of things that the average man of the period would have had in his head.&quot; Pound compared &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot; to Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;.

Julian Barnes said that it &quot;requires a stubborn reader, one willing to suspend normal expectations and able to confront both repetitious effects and a vomitorium of pre-digested book learning.&quot;

In his essay &quot;A Defense on &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot;&quot; Jorge Luis Borges writes that &quot;Flaubert was the author who forged the realist novel was also the first to shatter it.&quot; He compares the novel with the satirical parables of Jonathan Swift and Voltaire and thinks that it anticipates Franz Kafka&#x27;s absurdism.

<text>Stoneage Romeos is the debut album by Australian rock group Hoodoo Gurus. Released in March 1984 by Big Time Records in Australia, the album&#x27;s release saw them receive record sales to complement their already strong reputation for live performances. With radio and television support for their third single &quot;My Girl&quot; (1983), complete with a film clip about a greyhound of the same name, the band&#x27;s following grew. The album&#x27;s other singles were &quot;Leilani&quot;, &quot;Tojo&quot; and &quot;I Want You Back&quot;. The album peaked at number 29 on the Australian charts.

The band won &quot;Best Debut Album&quot; at the 1984 &quot;Countdown&quot; Awards.

A&amp;M Records released the album in the United States on 7 September 1984.

&quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot; was re-released by Arcadia Records on 1 October 2002, with two additional tracks, &quot;Hoodoo You Love&quot; and &quot;Be My Guru&quot;. EMI also re-released the album on 24 October 2005 with three bonus tracks, &quot;Leilani Pt. 2&quot;, &quot;Be My Guru&quot; and &quot;Hoodoo You Love&quot;, a fold-out poster and liner notes by Lindsay &quot;The Doctor&quot; McDougall of Frenzal Rhomb.

In October 2010, the album was listed in the top 30 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot;.

==Release==
The title &quot;Stoneage Romeos&quot; is taken from a Three Stooges short film. The Australian LP, designed by Yanni Stumbles, sported a cartoonish nod to the 1966 caveman flick &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot;, all menacing dinosaurs and Day-Glo colors, whilst in America, consumers got a stylized sleeve featuring arty renditions of the giant reptiles. On the change of covers, the band&#x27;s frontman Dave Faulkner would later recall:

<text>Vibrio harveyi is a Gram-negative, bioluminescent, marine bacterium in the genus &quot;Vibrio&quot;. &quot;V. harveyi&quot; is rod-shaped, motile (via polar flagella), facultatively anaerobic, halophilic, and competent for both fermentative and respiratory metabolism. It does not grow below 4 °C ( optimum growth: 30° to 35 °C). &quot;V. harveyi&quot; can be found free-swimming in tropical marine waters, commensally in the gut microflora of marine animals, and as both a primary and opportunistic pathogen of marine animals, including Gorgonian corals, oysters, prawns, lobsters, the common snook, barramundi, turbot, milkfish, and seahorses. It is responsible for luminous vibriosis, a disease that affects commercially farmed penaeid prawns. Additionally, based on samples taken by ocean-going ships, &quot;V. harveyi&quot; is thought to be the cause of the milky seas effect, in which, during the night, a uniform blue glow is emitted from the seawater. Some glows can cover nearly .

== Quorum sensing ==
Groups of &quot;V. harveyi&quot; bacteria communicate by quorum sensing to coordinate the production of bioluminescence and virulence factors. Quorum sensing was first studied in &quot;V. fischeri&quot; (now &quot;Aliivibrio fischeri&quot;), a marine bacterium that uses a synthase (LuxI) to produce a species-specific autoinducer (AI) that binds a cognate receptor (LuxR) that regulates changes in expression. Coined &quot;LuxI/R&quot; quorum sensing, these systems have been identified in many other species of Gram-negative bacteria. Despite its relatedness to &quot;A. fischeri&quot;, &quot;V. harveyi&quot; lacks a LuxI/R quorum-sensing system, and instead employs a hybrid quorum-sensing circuit, detecting its AI through a membrane-bound histidine kinase and using a phosphorelay to convert information about the population size to changes in gene expression. Since their identification in &quot;V. harveyi&quot;, such hybrid systems have been identified in many other bacterial species. Qrr RNA molecules are responsible for controlling regulator translation, repressing and promoting factors dependent on cell density. &quot;V. harveyi&quot; uses a second AI, termed autoinducer-2 or AI-2, which is unusual because it is made and detected by a variety of different bacteria, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive. Thus, &quot;V. harveyi&quot; has been instrumental to the understanding and appreciation of interspecies bacterial communication.

<text>The X-Files (also known as The X-Files: Fight the Future) is a 1998 American science fiction thriller film based on Chris Carter&#x27;s television series of the same name&quot;, &quot; which revolves around fictional unsolved cases called the X-Files and the characters solving them. It was directed by Rob Bowman, written by Carter and Frank Spotnitz and featured five main characters from the television series: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mitch Pileggi, John Neville, and William B. Davis reprise their respective roles as FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner, Well-Manicured Man, and the Cigarette-Smoking Man. The film was promoted with the tagline &quot;Fight the Future&quot;.

The film takes place between seasons five (episode &quot;The End&quot;) and six (episode &quot;The Beginning&quot;) of the television series, and is based upon the series&#x27; extraterrestrial mythology. The story follows agents Mulder and Scully, removed from their usual jobs on the X-Files, and investigating the bombing of a building and the destruction of criminal evidence. They uncover what appears to be a government conspiracy attempting to hide the truth about an alien colonization of Earth.

Carter decided to make a feature film to explore the show&#x27;s mythology on a wider scale and appeal to non-fans. He wrote the story with Frank Spotnitz at the end of 1996 and, with a budget from 20th Century Fox, filming began in 1997, following the end of the show&#x27;s fourth season. Carter assembled cast and crew from the show, as well as some other, well-known actors such as Blythe Danner and Martin Landau, to begin production on what they termed &quot;Project Blackwood&quot;. The film was produced by Carter and Daniel Sackheim. Mark Snow continued his role as &quot;X-Files&quot; composer to create the film&#x27;s score.

The film premiered on June 19, 1998, in the United States, and received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, earning $189 million worldwide against a budget of $66 million. A sequel, titled &quot;I Want to Believe&quot;, was released ten years later in 2008.

==Plot==
In 35,000 B.C. during the Ice Age, in what will become North Texas, two cavemen hunters encounter an extraterrestrial life form in a cave, which kills one and infects the other with a black oil-like substance. In 1998, a boy falls into a hole and is also infected by the black oil after it seeps from the ground. Firefighters who enter the hole to rescue him do not come out. A team of men wearing hazmat suits later extract the bodies of the boy and the firefighters. Meanwhile, FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, investigating a bomb threat against a federal building in Dallas, discover the bomb in a building across the street. As the building is evacuated, Special Agent in Charge Darius Michaud remains, ostensibly to disarm the bomb. However, he simply waits for the bomb to detonate.

Mulder and Scully are later chastised because, in addition to Michaud, the firefighters and the boy were in the building during the bombing. That evening, Mulder is accosted by paranoid doctor Alvin Kurtzweil, who explains that the &quot;victims&quot; were already dead and that the bombing was staged to cover up how they died. At the hospital morgue, Scully examines one of the victims, finding evidence of an alien virus. Meanwhile, The Smoking Man goes to Texas, where Dr. Ben Bronschweig shows him one of the lost firefighters, who now has an alien organism residing inside his body. The Smoking Man orders Bronschweig to administer a vaccine to it, but to burn the body if it fails. Later, the alien organism gestates and kills Bronschweig.

Mulder and Scully travel to the site of the hole in Texas, finding it has been hastily turned into a new playground, and encountering the boys whose friend fell inside. Driving in the direction indicated by the boys, the pair encounters a train with white gasoline tankers and follow it to a cornfield surrounding two glowing domes. Inside the domes, grates in the floor open and swarms of bees fly out, overwhelming the agents. They flee through an adjacent cornfield, chased by black helicopters, but manage to escape when the helicopters disappear.

In Washington, D.C., Scully attends a performance hearing; meanwhile, Mulder meets with Kurtzweil in an attempt to get more information. Scully arrives at Mulder&#x27;s apartment to tell him she has been transferred to Salt Lake City. The two are about to kiss when Scully is stung by a bee that had lodged itself under her shirt collar. She falls unconscious while Mulder calls paramedics, but the ambulance driver shoots Mulder and takes Scully away. She is seen later in an isolation unit being loaded onto a plane. An unconscious Mulder is picked up by another ambulance. Not severely injured, he slips out of the hospital with the help of The Lone Gunmen and FBI Assistant Director Walter Skinner. He then meets a former adversary, the Well-Manicured Man, who gives him Scully&#x27;s location, along with a vaccine against the virus that has infected her. As Mulder leaves, the Well-Manicured Man shoots his driver and then kills himself in a car bomb before his betrayal of The Syndicate is discovered.

Forty-eight hours later, Mulder finds Scully in an underground facility in Antarctica which also contains many humans suspended in ice-like enclosures. He breaks Scully&#x27;s confinement and uses the vaccine to revive her, but this disrupts the facility and the cocooned aliens begin trying to escape. After Mulder and Scully escape to the surface, an alien vessel emerges from beneath the ice and travels into the sky. Mulder watches it disappear into the distance as Scully regains full consciousness.

At another hearing, Scully&#x27;s testimony is disregarded and evidence in Texas is destroyed. To the hearing moderator, she hands over the only remaining proof of their ordeal—the bee that stung her—noting that the FBI is not currently capable of investigating this evidence. Outside, Mulder reads an article that has covered up the domes and crop field in Texas. Scully reveals that she is willing to continue working with him: &quot;If I quit now, they win.&quot; At another crop outpost in Tunisia, the Smoking Man warns Conrad Strughold that Mulder remains a threat, explaining what Mulder has found out about the virus. He then hands him a telegram revealing that the X-files unit has been re-opened.

==Production==

===Conception and pre-production===

After five successful seasons, Chris Carter wanted to tell the story of the series on a wider scale, which ultimately meant creating a feature film. He later explained that the main problem was to create a story for which the viewer would not need to be familiar with the show&#x27;s setting and the various story arcs.

Carter and Frank Spotnitz wrote major parts of the script in Hawaii over Christmas 1996. They used the same method that they had used when writing episodes and sketching out scenes for the series on 3x5 index cards. By the time the Christmas break had ended, the whole narrative for the film had been written. Upon his return from Hawaii, Carter looked for spare time to write the script. He returned to Hawaii and in ten days wrote about half of the 124-page screenplay for the film.

Carter gave 90 pages of the screenplay to Fox who received it well. While not officially greenlighted, he got a budget from Fox and began to make plans as to when and where it would be filmed. Carter then enlisted Daniel Sackheim as a producer on the film. Sackheim had previously produced the pilot episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; and directed several episodes in the first two seasons. &quot;The X-Files&quot; marked his first contribution as producer to a feature film. Carter&#x27;s choice for director was Rob Bowman, who had been the series&#x27; executive producer and a director before the production base was moved from Vancouver to Los Angeles.

During production, the filmmakers went to great lengths to preserve secrecy, including printing the script on red paper to prevent photocopying, and leaking disinformation to the media and giving the film the codename &quot;Project Blackwood&quot;. The code was cracked by fans who speculated on the meaning behind it. During the North Texas scene, &quot;Blackwood County&quot; can be seen on the fire trucks responding to the infected boy. According to Spotnitz, &quot;Blackwood&quot; held no particular significance.

At the beginning of the pre-production phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg for his 1993 film, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the Ten Thirteen Productions staff members—but not to take it away. At this time, most of the staff members had not read the script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as production designer, Ward Russell as director of photography and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel six weeks before principal filming began.

===Writing and casting===

Both Carter and Spotnitz wanted to make the film &quot;bigger&quot; than the series, so they decided to start and end the film at an &quot;extreme place&quot; and explain aspects of the story arc that the show had not. While gathering research materials, they learned that the Earth was once covered with ice and decided to open the film in Texas in 35,000 BC with human &quot;Primitives&quot; as the first characters to appear.

The film included known actors from the show such as David Duchovny as Fox Mulder, Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, Mitch Pileggi as Walter Skinner and William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man, as well as new actors and characters to the franchise. These included Martin Landau and Blythe Danner. The signing of these actors broke with what had become tradition for &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Carter had purposely cast virtually unknown actors for the television series, to make it more believable; &quot;As soon as you put in an actor whose face is very recognizable, you&#x27;ve got a situation that works against the reality of the show.&quot; He saw creating the film as a chance to break this rule. He offered Glenne Headly the small role of a bartender. A fan of the show, she accepted enthusiastically.

===Set design===
Chris Nowak was hired as production designer for the film by Daniel Sackheim. Nowak was a former architect who had worked as a professional theater set designer for eight years, before moving towards the film business as an art director. Nowak had previously worked with Sackheim on a television production, which led to Sackheim contacting him to do an interview for the selection of a production designer. According to Sackheim, Nowak was hired because he was the only one able to create a &quot;focused vision&quot; for the film.

Nowak wanted to start the design process after talking through the story with the filmmakers so that he could formulate &quot;a sense of the atmosphere&quot; which they wanted to create for the film. He wanted to create a &quot;dark, scary and oppressive environment&quot; for the characters, especially Mulder. While familiar with the television series, Nowak decided not to review any episodes as preparation for his role in the production. Explaining this decision, he said, &quot;I wanted the movie to be as fresh and new as possible in its design. Of course, there were some elements from the show that had to be retained.&quot;

The design department found all their locations and designed sets in eight weeks, guided by input from the filmmakers. Nowak started by creating artwork for all the major sets and locations, working with the two concept artists Tim Flattery and Jim Martin. Nowak created drafts and sent them to Flattery and Martin who continued to develop them until they were complete. The complete artwork was then presented to Chris Carter, Rob Bowman, Lata Ryan and Sackheim for approval. While considering the time schedule, they made no notable changes to the artwork.

Once the set concepts were approved by Carter, Bowman, Sackheim and Ryan, they were sent to the blueprint stage so that construction of the sets could begin under the supervision of construction coordinator Bill Liams. All the major sets were constructed &quot;simultaneously&quot; because of the schedule. However, this proved to be a challenge for the production team, because it meant they had to pay the rent on all the stages at the same time. The set construction started seven weeks before filming.

===Filming===

Carter and Bowman wanted to film in as many different locations as possible to give the film a &quot;grander&quot; feel than had usually been achievable for the television episodes. The tighter schedule, with only eight weeks of pre-production and 45 days of principal photography, still caused the production to have less location shooting than planned. Los Angeles ended up standing in for Dallas and London (though a shot was done in London with a double), and the ice scenes, initially envisaged for an ice field in Alaska, were moved to Whistler, British Columbia, nearby the show&#x27;s regular locations in Vancouver. Principal photography for the film started on June 16, 1997.

&quot;The X-Files&quot; was filmed in the hiatus between the show&#x27;s fourth and fifth seasons and re-shoots were conducted during the filming of the show&#x27;s fifth season. Due to the demands of the film shoot on the actors&#x27; schedules, some episodes of the fifth season did not revolve around both Mulder and Scully but just one of the two lead stars.

===Music===

Two soundtracks, &quot;The X-Files: Original Motion Picture Score&quot; and &quot;The X-Files: The Album&quot; were both released to home markets in 1998. &quot;The X-Files: The Album&quot; included a take on the original theme song by the American duo The Dust Brothers, and included a hidden track on which Chris Carter details a summary of &quot;The X-Files&quot; mythology. Mark Snow, who had worked on the television series as a composer, was hired to score the film. Chris Carter wanted a &quot;very minimal approach&quot; to the music. He did not want much &quot;melody&quot; and wanted to replace it with plain &quot;ambient atmosphere&quot; and &quot;sound design&quot;. Snow mixed electronic music with an 85-member orchestra to give the film a &quot;great sense of scope and grandeur.&quot;

When creating the music for the film, Snow had a couple of months to write and produce the music, composing the television series simultaneously. The film marked the first time in the history of the franchise that music was composed and recorded with the help of an orchestra, although, according to Snow, there was no significant change in the recording and writing process during the production of the film. The most substantial difference was that Snow used MIDI files to save his musical scores and pieces, which would afterward be sent to a copyist who would take it through one of their programs and eventually give it to the orchestrators.

==Release==

===Theatrical run===
The film was distributed by 20th Century Fox and premiered theatrically in the United States (as well as Canada) on June 19, 1998, along with Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mulan&quot;. It closed after 14 weeks, with its widest release having been 2,650 theaters.

===Home media===
The same year as the international theatrical release, &quot;The X Files&quot; was released on VHS on October 13, 1998 with an Extended Cut that is 41 seconds longer than the theatrical release. The VHS comes in either pan and scan fullscreen or widescreen releases and both versions are THX certified. The film later debuted on DVD in Region 1 on May 4, 1999 and in Region 2 on January 24, 2000. On January 23, 2001, the DVD was released once again, this time featuring a DTS enhanced widescreen version and THX Optimode. In 2008, producer Frank Spotnitz announced plans to release a new special edition DVD and Blu-ray edition of the film. &quot;We are working on packing the [re-issued] DVD and Blu-ray releases with as many extras as they will fit, including video and audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, trailers, a new documentary, and several other cool surprises.&quot; The Blu-ray version was released on December 2, 2008. In addition, a novelization of the film was written by Elizabeth Hand and released on June 19, 1998.

===Television airing===
The film was originally scheduled to air on Fox on September 14, 2001, but was pulled following the September 11 attacks which happened three days prior to its scheduled airing. It was replaced with a repeat airing of &quot;Nine Months&quot;. This also happened to &quot;Independence Day&quot;, which was pulled from its scheduled September 16, 2001 airing as &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; took its spot.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film grossed $83,898,313 in the U.S. and $105,278,110 abroad, giving a total worldwide gross of $189,176,423. In its opening weekend, showing at 2,629 theaters, it earned $30,138,758 which was 35.9% of its total gross. According to Box Office Mojo, it ranked at No. 23 for all films released in the U.S. in 1998 and No. 10 for PG-13 rated films released that year.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 66% rating based on reviews from 73 critics and an average rating of 6.1/10. The consensus states, &quot;Results may vary for newcomers, but fans of the series will enjoy its big-screen transition.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 23 critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A− on scale of A to F.
Roger Ebert gave a positive review of the film with three out of four stars, saying, &quot;As pure movie, &quot;The X-Files&quot; more or less works. As a story, it needs a sequel, a prequel, and Cliff Notes.&quot; Gene Siskel also gave the film three out of four stars, saying that he was intrigued by the characters and was &quot;now seriously tempted to watch the TV show.&quot; Joyce Millman of &quot;Salon&quot; was more equivocal, writing, &quot;... You really can&#x27;t treat &quot;The X-Files&quot; as a movie because it isn&#x27;t one. It&#x27;s a two-hour episode of the show,&quot; and said it was far from the &quot;most satisfying&quot; of &quot;X-Files&quot; releases. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reviewer Bob Graham was positive towards the film, calling &quot;David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson [...] enormously sympathetic heroes.&quot; Michael O&#x27;Sullivan, a reviewer from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the film, &quot;stylish, scary, sardonically funny and at times just plain gross.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reviewer Kenneth Turan felt that it was difficult to make sense of the film, saying that it relied too heavily on the series&#x27; mythology. Lisa Alspector wrote that &quot;Only two scenes in this spin-off are worth the time of followers of the TV series.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Todd McCarthy remarked, &quot;As it is, the pic serves up set-pieces and a measure of scope that are beyond TV size but remain rather underwhelming by feature standards.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; responded negatively towards the film, opining that it was uneventful and scorning the &quot;hush-hush atmosphere&quot; surrounding the production. Andrew Johnston reviewed the film in &quot;Time Out New York&quot; and observed: &quot;The X-Files has always been the most cinematic show on TV, and Bowman (who&#x27;s directed many of its best episodes) expands the show&#x27;s scale and impact on the big screen while keeping its charms intact.&quot;

==Sequel==

&quot;The X-Files&quot; has spawned one sequel, a 2008 film entitled &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot; released six years after the series ended. The film grossed $68 million and received a lower approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes than the first film. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chris Carter announced that if &quot;I Want to Believe&quot; proved successful, he would propose that a third film go back to the television series&#x27; mythology and focus on the alien invasion foretold within the series, due to occur in December 2012. No third film appeared; instead, the TV series was revived in 2016.

<text>The semicollared flycatcher (Ficedula semitorquata) is a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family, one of the four species of Western Palearctic black-and-white flycatchers. It breeds in montane forests of the southeastern corner of Europe (Balkan Peninsula) to Northwest Iran. It is migratory, wintering in Central and Eastern Africa. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe. Tracking studies using geolocators have revealed that weather conditions during spring migration can have a large impact on the timing of Semicollared flycatcher migration and survival of adult birds.

This is a 12–13.5 cm long bird, intermediate in appearance between collared flycatcher and European pied flycatcher. It has often been classed as a subspecies of collared flycatcher.

The breeding male is mainly black above and white below, with a white half-collar, extending further back than in pied, large white wing patch, extensively white tail sides and a large white forehead patch. It has a pale grey rump. The bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. It mainly takes insects in flight, rarely hunting caterpillars amongst the tree foliage like pied flycatcher.

Non-breeding male, females and juvenile semi-collared flycatchers have the black replaced by a pale brown, and may be very difficult to distinguish from other &quot; Ficedula&quot; flycatchers, particularly the collared flycatcher. A distinction is that semicollared may show a white second wing bar, but many individuals are not separable in the field.

Semicollared flycatchers are birds of belts of deciduous woodlands, especially oak and hornbeam, in mountainous areas. They build an open nest in a native tree-holes and old nests of woodpeckers, also the species can occupy nest-boxes. The clutch size is 4-7 eggs. The song is again intermediate between collared and pied flycatchers, with slow strained whistles, but some rhythmic elements.

<text>Enercon GmbH is a wind turbine manufacturer based in Aurich, Lower Saxony, Germany. It has been the market leader in Germany since the mid-1990s. Enercon has production facilities in Germany (Aurich, Emden and Magdeburg), Brazil, India, Canada, Turkey and Portugal. In June 2010, Enercon announced that they would be setting up Irish headquarters in Tralee.

The Aloys-Wobben-foundation of founder Aloys Wobben owns the UEE Holding, which owns the Enercon GmbH. Aloys Wobben, Simon Wobben and Hans-Dieter Kettwich control the company.

, Enercon had installed more than 26,300 wind turbines, with a power generating capacity exceeding 43 GW. The most-often installed model is the E-40, which pioneered the gearbox-less design in 1993. As of July 2011, Enercon has a market share of 7.2% worldwide (fifth-highest) and 59.2% in Germany.


== Company structure ==
Aloys Wobben founded the Aloys-Wobbe-Stiftung. The foundation owns the UEE Holding, which Enercon belongs to. 

Over 30 supply companies exclusively work for Enercon. In 2018 some of them, including WEC Turmbau Emden, WEC Turmbau Magdeburg and Aero Ems GmbH, announced that they would fire a total of 800 employees. Enercon declared that these companies would be completely independent. 

In fact, the companies belong to the Grp Aloys B A Wobben Breeze Trust based in Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands through nested ownership structures. At the time, the NDR assumed that the structure was set up so that Aloys Wobben could skim off his profits but not have to make any social obligations to his employees.

== History ==
In 1984, Wobben founded a wind turbine manufacturer called Enercon in Aurich by developing and producing wind turbines with three employees. In 1993, Wobben switched production to the gearless wind turbine with a full converter, a technology that he had developed. The Enercon E-40 turbine met expectations and was gained worldwide success.

Wobben withdrew from the operational business in 2012 and transferred his company shares to the Aloys-Wobben Foundation with effect from 1 October 2012. Since 2016 his nephew Simon Wobben is part of the managing team. 

On 24 February 2022, the day of the Russian full scale invasion of Ukraine, the remote maintenance units of 5,800 Enercon wind turbines were affected by a suspected Russian cyber-attack on the satellite system operator Viasat and had to be replaced. 

According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Aloys Wobben had a net worth of $7.1 billion as of August 2021.

==Technologies==
Enercon wind turbines have some special technical features compared to turbines of most other manufacturers. One is the gearless propulsion concept, which Enercon pioneered since 1993. The first generation of gearless turbines was the E-40/500 kW series. (Earlier Enercon designs had a transmission train.) The hub with the rotor blades connects directly to the rotor of the ring generator (direct drive). The rotor unit rotates on a front and rear main bearing about a fixed axis. The speed of the rotor is transmitted directly to the high-pole synchronous generator, where the rotor rotates in the stator, differently. The Enercon generator has no permanent magnets, allowing the company to not rely on rare-earth metals. However, the direct connection also causes grid losses. Rotation speed and the mechanical load changes over the service life are lower than geared systems. Rotation speed varies from 18 to 45 revolutions per minute (RPM) for the E-33 and 5-11.7 RPM for the E-126 depending on wind speed, while a geared generator has a speed of about 1500 RPM at rated power. Thus the large Enercon generators lead to high tower head masses, and construction and logistical challenges. In 2022, the first integrated box-shaped nacelles with inverter and transformer reduced logistics - all previous Enercon turbines had power systems in the tower base.

Most Enercon systems are visually distinct from systems of other manufacturers. Their nacelles have been drop-shaped since 1995/1996. This unique design was developed by British architect Norman Foster, who also designed the dome of the Berlin Reichstag. In Germany and many other countries, the tower has coloured green rings above the foundation, which get brighter from bottom to top. On islands such as Borkum, the gradation is blue. The NCS grading is intended to better integrate the plant towers into the horizon. The rotor blades were the only ones on the market with blade tips similar to the winglets on aircraft.

In 2008, the first E-126 turbines (successor of the E-112) were installed at sites throughout Germany and Belgium, including the Estinnes wind farm (consisting of eleven E-126 turbines) in Belgium. Although the E-126 turbine was initially developed with a power rating of 6 MW, it has since been upgraded to 7.5 MW. The E-82 turbine was also upgraded and is available in 2, 2.3, and 3 MW versions.

Currently Enercon does not offer or supply wind turbines to offshore projects and has at times expressed skepticism about offshore wind parks. Enercon was rumored to have been ready to supply turbines to Germany&#x27;s Alpha Ventus offshore wind farm and to a near-shore park near Wilhelmshaven but did not do so.

==Turbines==
Note: wind turbine designations with a &quot;*&quot; mean the turbine is either temporarily unavailable, or has been taken off sale permanently.

==Issues==
===Patent dispute===
Enercon was prohibited from exporting their wind turbines to the US until 2010 due to alleged infringement of . In a dispute before the United States International Trade Commission, Enercon did not challenge the validity of the US patent but argued that their technology was not affected. The ITC decided that the patent covered the technology in question and banned Enercon turbines from the US market until 2010. Later, a cross patent agreement was made with the competitor General Electric, the successor of Kenetech, after similar claims of Enercon against GE. According to a NSA employee detailed information concerning Enercon was passed on to Kenetech via ECHELON. The aim of the alleged industrial espionage against Enercon was the forwarding of details of Wobben&#x27;s generator technology to a US firm.

==Other ventures==
From 2008 to 2020, Enercon was part owner of a railway company, which among other things owns the Abelitz–Aurich railway, (via :de:Eisenbahninfrastrukturgesellschaft Aurich-Emden) which is used to deliver wind turbine blades made by Enercon via rail to customers. During the time Enercon part-owned the rail line, the company undertook large scale investments in its infrastructure. In 2020 Enercon sold its rail ventures To Hermann Bettels GmbH.

<doc id="1078877" wikidata="Q3026751" url="?curid=1078877" title="Dictionary of Received Ideas">
<text>The Dictionary of Received Ideas (or Dictionary of Accepted Ideas; in French, Le Dictionnaire des idées reçues) is a short satirical work collected and published in 1911–13 from notes compiled by Gustave Flaubert during the 1870s, lampooning the clichés endemic to French society under the Second French Empire. It takes the form of a dictionary of automatic thoughts and platitudes, self-contradictory and insipid. It is often paired with the &quot;Sottisier&quot; (a collection of stupid quotations taken from the books of famous writers).

==Purpose==
At the time of Flaubert&#x27;s death, it was unclear whether he intended eventually to publish it separately, or as an appendix to his unfinished novel &quot;Bouvard et Pécuchet&quot;. In some of his notes, it seems that Flaubert intended the dictionary to be taken as the final creation of the two protagonists. In other notes, it seems the &quot;Sottisier&quot; is intended as their final work. Flaubert&#x27;s two main themes are the &quot;castigation of the cliché&quot; and &quot;an attack on misinformation, prejudice and incoherence as regards matters of fact&quot;.

==Background==
The idea of a spoof encyclopedia had fascinated him all his life. As a child, he had amused himself by writing down the absurd utterances of a friend of his mother&#x27;s, and over the course of his career he speculated as to the best format for a compilation of stupidities. In a letter to Louis Bouilhet from 1850, Flaubert wrote: Such a book, with a good preface in which the motive would be stated to be the desire to bring the nation back to Tradition, Order and Sound Conventions—all this so phrased that the reader would not know whether or not his leg was being pulled—such a book would certainly be unusual, even likely to succeed, because it would be entirely up to the minute. He wrote to Louise Colet in 1852: No law could attack me, though I should attack everything. It would be the justification of &quot;Whatever is, is right&quot;. I should sacrifice the great men to all the nitwits, the martyrs to all the executioners, and do it in a style carried to the wildest pitch—fireworks... After reading the book, one would be afraid to talk, for fear of using one of the phrases in it.

==Examples==
*ABSINTHE. Extra-violent poison: one glass and you&#x27;re dead. Newspapermen drink it as they write their copy. Has killed more soldiers than the Bedouin.
*ARCHIMEDES. On hearing his name, shout &quot;Eureka!&quot; Or else: &quot;Give me a fulcrum and I will move the world.&quot; There is also Archimedes&#x27; screw, but you are not expected to know what it is.
*ARTS. Are quite useless, since they are replaced by machines that manufacture even more quickly.
*FEUDALISM. No need to have one single precise notion about it: thunder against.
*OMEGA. Second letter of the Greek alphabet. [reference to alpha and omega]
*THIRTEEN. Avoid being thirteen at table; it brings bad luck. The sceptics should not fail to crack jokes: &quot;What is the difference? I&#x27;ll eat enough for two!&quot; Or again, if there are ladies, ask if any is pregnant.
*WALTZ. Wax indignant about. A lascivious, impure dance that should only be danced by old ladies.

==Parallels==
The dictionary is comparable in many respects to Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, but takes the opposite tack by affirming all the commonplace notions.

==Influence==
The British impresario and humorist Willie Donaldson was long interested in the &quot;Dictionary&quot;; and, as &quot;Henry Root&quot;, published something similar for the Britain of the 1980s: &quot;Henry Root&#x27;s World of Knowledge&quot;.

<text>Christopher Bradley Owens (born 7 September 1961) is a Canadian actor. He is best known for his performances on the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;.
==Early life==
Owens was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Jeannette, a jazz singer, and Garry Owens, a jazz drummer.

==Career==
Owens has performed in many feature films, often in minor roles, including appearances in &quot;Cocktail&quot; and &quot;The Recruit&quot;. However, he is best known for his performances on the television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Owens initially guest starred as the younger version of William B. Davis&#x27;s character, the Cigarette Smoking Man, in a 1996 episode &quot;Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;. He returned in 1997 in the same role in an episode called &quot;Demons&quot;. Later that year, he played the Frankenstein-esque Great Mutato in a surreal episode called &quot;The Post-Modern Prometheus&quot;.

In 1998, Owens was cast as special agent Jeffrey Spender, son of The Smoking Man and alien abductee Cassandra Spender. Owens was credited as &#x27;Also Starring&#x27; but only appeared in eight episodes, spread across the show&#x27;s fifth and sixth seasons, before his character died at the hand of his father. Owens returned in a 2002 episode called &quot;William&quot;, playing a hideously disfigured Jeffrey Spender who had survived the &quot;murder&quot;. He appeared a few episodes later in &quot;The Truth&quot;, the series finale.
Owens appeared one final time as Jeffrey Spender, on January 3rd, 2018, in The X-Files Eleventh Season Premiere, &quot;My Struggle III&quot;, in order to warn Agent Scully and also divulged the last name of her son’s adoptive parents.

He has been nominated for numerous awards, including a 2002 Genie Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for &quot;The Uncles&quot;.

<doc id="1078887" wikidata="Q279169" url="?curid=1078887" title="Mitch Pileggi">
<text>Mitch Pileggi (born April 5, 1952) is an American actor. He played Horace Pinker in &quot;Shocker&quot;, Walter Skinner on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Colonel Steven Caldwell on &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, Ernest Darby in &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;, and Harris Ryland in the TNT revival of &quot;Dallas&quot; (2012–2014).

==Early life and education==
Pileggi was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Maxine, a homemaker, and Vito Pileggi, a defense contractor. Pileggi&#x27;s family moved frequently because of his father&#x27;s occupation, and Pileggi lived in Oregon, California, and Texas before spending most of his adolescence in Turkey.

==Career==
Pileggi began acting while he was a high school student in Turkey, playing musical theater. After returning to Austin from Iran, he performed in local theaters and continued his acting career with small roles in B-movies and guest roles in television series, such as &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;China Beach&quot;, &quot;Code of Vengeance&quot;, and &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot;.

In the 1980s, Pileggi starred in several films, including &quot;Three O&#x27;Clock High&quot;, as Duke &quot;The Duker&quot; Herman, an overzealous tough-as-nails high school parking lot security guard. In 1988, he starred in &quot;Brothers In Arms&quot; as one of the villains (Caleb) and in &quot;Shocker&quot; as body-possessing serial killer Horace Pinker. The latter was directed by horror icon Wes Craven. Pileggi played the villain in the 1991 television film, &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot;, a sequel to the original television series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. He also appeared briefly in the 1992 film &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; as an investigating police officer in the interrogation scene of Michael Douglas. He also appeared in the 1995 vampire film &quot;Vampire in Brooklyn&quot; (also directed by Craven) starring Eddie Murphy as an Italian mobster.

His most notable role was as the FBI&#x27;s Assistant Director Walter Skinner on &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The role was originally recurring, but the part expanded, and in 2001 he became a regular member of the cast. The character gradually became the most integral character besides the two leads. He remained with the series until its end in 2002. Pileggi played the character in the 1998 &quot;The X-Files&quot; film and in the 2008 film &quot;The X-Files: I Want to Believe&quot;. He also reprised the role in the 2016 miniseries.

Pileggi&#x27;s later work has included starring in the short-lived series &quot;Tarzan&quot; and co-starring with Barbara Hershey and Oliver Hudson in the short-lived series &quot;The Mountain&quot;. He played the recurring role of character Colonel Steven Caldwell, Commander of the Earth Battlecruiser, &quot;Daedalus&quot;, in the second (2005) and subsequent seasons of the television series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;&quot; and in 2006 had a regular guest role on &quot;Day Break&quot; as Robbery/Homicide Detective Spivak. Pileggi also appeared on the &quot;Cold Case&quot; episode &quot;Offender&quot;, as a father accused of molesting and murdering his own son, who then threatens to murder one child sex offender per day until the case is reopened and solved. Pileggi also played the role of Larry Jennings, chairman of the board of the hospital, in &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. In a first-season episode of &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; he played Red Forman&#x27;s swinger, navy buddy, Bull, alongside his real life wife, Arlene.

Pileggi appeared in two episodes of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as DEA agent Jack Hammond. Since 2008, Pileggi has played Ernest Darby, the head of a white supremacist gang called the &quot;Nordics&quot;, in the FX drama &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; . He also played spree killer Norman Hill (AKA The Road Warrior) on a season four episode of &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;, titled &quot;Normal&quot;. Pileggi has also done some voice acting. His voice was featured as the githzerai Dak&#x27;kon in the video game &quot;&quot;. He voices Commissioner James Gordon on the Kids&#x27; WB series &quot;The Batman&quot;. Pileggi also hosted the Fox specials &quot;Breaking the Magician&#x27;s Code: Magic&#x27;s Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed&quot; and &quot;Conspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon?&quot;. He also played the recurring role of Sam and Dean Winchester&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Samuel Campbell, in the TV series &quot;Supernatural&quot;.

Pileggi starred in the TNT drama series &quot;Dallas&quot; as Harris Ryland. He was promoted to series regular in the second season.

As of 2014, Pileggi is on the advisory board of Sci-Fest, the first annual Los Angeles Science Fiction One-Act Play Festival, held in May 2014.

Since 2021, Pileggi has played Bonham Walker, the father of the titular Cordell Walker, in The CW crime drama series &quot;Walker&quot; reboot.

She acted in daytime soap operas such as &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, &quot;Another World&quot;, and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; before moving to primetime television with a recurring role on &quot;Knots Landing&quot;. From 1992 to 1997, she starred as Kimberly Shaw on &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Cross played the role of the housewife Bree Van de Kamp on the ABC television series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004–2012), for which she was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She had a recurring role as President Claire Haas on the ABC series &quot;Quantico&quot;.

==Early life==
Cross was born in Marlborough, Massachusetts, and she is of English and Irish descent. She is one of three daughters of Janet, a teacher, and Mark J. Cross, a personnel manager. Cross was raised Catholic. She graduated from Marlborough High School in 1980 and received a half-scholarship to Juilliard. She completed college in 1984 earning a B.F.A. in Acting. Cross returned to school in 1997 receiving a master&#x27;s degree in psychology from Antioch University Los Angeles in 2003.

==Career==
Cross began her television career in 1984 on the soap opera &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, playing the recurring role of Liz Correll. Afterwards, she relocated from New York to Los Angeles, and soon landed roles in television movies such as &quot;The Last Days of Frank and Jesse James&quot;, co-starring with Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson. In 1986, she joined the cast of the daytime soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, where she played the role of Kate Sanders, until 1987. She followed this with guest roles on primetime shows such as &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;, &quot;Knots Landing&quot; and &quot;Cheers&quot;.

In 1992, Cross was cast as Dr. Kimberly Shaw in the primetime soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. She left in the fifth season. She also appeared in sitcoms such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;Spin City&quot; and &quot;The King of Queens&quot;. Her dramatic roles include appearances on &quot;&quot;, &quot;Strong Medicine&quot;, &quot;Profiler&quot; and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;. Her film credits include &quot;Bad Influence&quot; (1990), &quot;Always Say Goodbye&quot; (1996), &quot;Just Peck&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bringing Up Bobby&quot; (2011). In 2003, Cross spent a season co-starring as Linda Abbott on the TV series &quot;Everwood&quot;.

In 2004, Cross starred in the role of Bree Van de Kamp in &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. The show was one of the breakout hits of the 2004–2005 television season, and Cross was nominated for several awards for her role, including an Emmy Award, three Golden Globe Awards, and five Screen Actors Guild Awards (winning two with cast). She also received a Satellite Award for her performance in the show&#x27;s second season. The series ran for eight seasons until 2012. In 2014, after two years on hiatus, Cross co-starred as the lead character&#x27;s mother in the unsuccessful comedy pilot &quot;Fatrick&quot;. In 2015, Cross guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and later she joined the cast of the thriller series &quot;Quantico&quot;, playing the recurring role of President Claire Haas, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee.

==Personal life==
As a child, Cross showed an early interest in performing. She took piano and dance lessons at the Ceil Sharon School of Dance, and was her high school&#x27;s mascot at school games. Her first acting role was in grade school, in a play called &quot;The Witch of Blackbird Pond&quot;.

=== Relationships ===
Cross was the long-time companion of actor Richard Jordan, who was 25 years her senior; Jordan died from a brain tumor in 1993. In 2006, she married stockbroker Tom Mahoney. Cross underwent in vitro fertilization soon after their wedding, and gave birth to fraternal twin daughters in February 2007, shortly before her 45th birthday.

=== Activism ===
In September 2018, Cross revealed she had been in remission for eight months after receiving treatment for anal cancer. She explained months later that she had decided to &quot;put a dent in the stigma&quot; because she had discovered through online research that anal cancer patients were embarrassed about their diagnosis. &quot;I found myself in a position where nobody wants this job. Nobody wants to come forward. And I knew that people were suffering and people were ashamed,&quot; she said at the 2019 The Atlantic&#x27;s People v. Cancer event. She advocates for open discussions and further public information about the HPV infection, which can cause cancers of the anus, cervix, ovary, penis, and throat: &quot;In spite of the optics, I care deeply about saving lives. To that end, the important thing to do is educate the public about HPV.&quot;

Cross expressed support for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war, citing the Israeli bombing of the Gaza Strip, including on healthcare facilities. In an Instagram post, she stated: &quot;I&#x27;m struggling to comprehend how to live among people with eyes that don&#x27;t water, hearts that don&#x27;t flinch, and voices that remain silent. There are no words for the horror that has and is being unleashed. And the silence has me believing I am deaf.&quot;

<doc id="1078895" wikidata="Q5630972" url="?curid=1078895" title="HMCS Yukon (DDE 263)">
<text>HMCS &quot;Yukon&quot; was a that served in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) and later the Canadian Forces. She was the first Canadian naval unit to carry the name. She was named for the Yukon River that runs from British Columbia through Yukon and into Alaska in the United States.

Entering service in 1963, she was primarily used as a training ship on the west coast. She was decommissioned in 1993 and sold for use as an artificial reef and sunk as such at Sunken Harbor off San Diego, California in 2000.

==Design==
The &quot;Mackenzie&quot; class was an offshoot of the design. Initially planned to be an improved version of the design, budget difficulties led to the Canadian government ordering a repeat of the previous , with improved habitability and better pre-wetting, bridge and weatherdeck fittings to better deal with extreme cold. The original intention was to give the &quot;Mackenzie&quot; class variable depth sonar during construction, but would have led to delays of up to a year in construction time, which the navy could not accept.

===General characteristics===
The &quot;Mackenzie&quot;-class vessels measured in length, with a beam of and a draught of . The &quot;Mackenzie&quot;s displaced fully loaded and had a complement of 290.

The class was powered by two Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers connected to the two-shaft English-Electric geared steam turbines creating . This gave the ships a maximum speed of .

===Armament===
The most noticeable change for the &quot;Mackenzie&quot;s was the replacement of the forward /50 calibre Mk 22 guns of the &quot;St. Laurent&quot; design with a dual Vickers 3-inch/70 calibre Mk 6 gun mount and the presence of a fire-control director atop the bridge superstructure. The bridge was raised one full deck higher than on previous classes in order to see over the new gun mount. The class did retain the rear dual 3-inch/50 calibre gun mount and for anti-submarine warfare, the class was provided with two Mk 10 Limbo mortars. The ships were initially fitted with Mark 43 torpedoes to supplement their anti-submarine capability, but were quickly upgraded to the Mark 44 launched from a modified depth charge thrower. This was to give the destroyers the ability to combat submarines from a distance.

===Sensors===
The &quot;Mackenzie&quot; class were equipped with one SPS-12 air search radar, one SPS-10B surface search radar and one Sperry Mk.2 navigation radar. For detection below the surface, the ships had one SQS-501 high frequency bottom profiler sonar, one SQS-503 hull mounted active search sonar, one SQS-502 high frequency mortar control sonar and one SQS-11 hull mounted active search sonar.

===DELEX refit===
The DEstroyer Life EXtension (DELEX) refit was born out of the need to extend the life of the steam-powered destroyer escorts of the Canadian Navy in the 1980s until the next generation of surface ship was built. Encompassing all the classes based on the initial &quot;St. Laurent&quot; (the remaining &quot;St. Laurent&quot;, &quot;Restigouche&quot;, &quot;Mackenzie&quot;, and vessels), the DELEX upgrades were meant to improve their ability to combat modern Soviet submarines, and to allow them to continue to operate as part of NATO task forces.

The DELEX refit for the &quot;Mackenzie&quot; class was the same for the Improved &quot;Restigouche&quot;-class vessels. This meant that the ships would receive the new tactical data system ADLIPS, new radars, new fire control and satellite navigation. They exchanged the SQS-503 sonar for the newer SQS-505 model.

They also received a triple mount for torpedo tubes that would use the new Mk 46 homing torpedo. The Mark 46 torpedo had a range of at over with a high-explosive warhead weighing .

==Construction and career==
&quot;Yukon&quot; was ordered in 1957 and laid down on 25 October 1959 at Burrard Dry Dock Ltd., North Vancouver. She was launched on 27 July 1961 and commissioned into the RCN on 25 May 1963 with the classification number DDE 263.

Though built on the west coast, &quot;Yukon&quot; immediately transferred to the east coast, sailing for Halifax, Nova Scotia on 27 July. She remained on the east coast for a year, where as part of the First Canadian Escort Squadron, &quot;Yukon&quot; escorted Queen Elizabeth II aboard on visits to several Canadian port cities. She returned to the Pacific in 1965. She was largely used as a training ship following her transfer by the RCN and later in the CF under Maritime Forces Pacific.

In 1970, &quot;Yukon&quot; sailed with sister ship and the auxiliary vessel on a training deployment throughout the Pacific, working with several navies and visiting Japan. In February 1975 underwent a mid-life refit. Upon completion, the ship joined Training Group Pacific. On 17 January 1983, &quot;Yukon&quot; collided with the U.S. aircraft carrier , with &quot;Yukon&quot; reporting slight damage to her mast. She underwent the DELEX refit at the Burrard Yarrow shipyard at Esquimalt, British Columbia from 28 May 1984 to 16 January 1985. In 1986, &quot;Yukon&quot; was one of three Canadian vessels that took part in the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s 75th anniversary celebrations. She was decommissioned from Maritime Command on 3 December 1993.

===As an artificial reef===
The ship was initially purchased by the Artificial Reef Society of British Columbia anchored on the New Westminster docks for almost a year before it was bought for $250,000. &quot;Yukon&quot;″s hulk was purchased by the San Diego Oceans Foundation which towed her from CFB Esquimalt to San Diego, California in 2000. She was gutted and cleaned before being scuttled in of water in the Pacific Ocean at Sunken Harbor off Mission Bay in San Diego as an artificial reef on 15 July 2000. However the day before she was to be scuttled, she flooded in rough weather and sank at the site on 14 July. The explosive charges intended to sink her were still intact on board, and United States Navy SEALs were sent in to remove the charges. The wreck was off limits for weeks while this was being done.

The ship ended up lying on her port side, with her masthead lying below the water instead of the planned . This made recreational diving on the wreck much more difficult. By December 2012, five people had died while diving on &quot;Yukon&quot;″s wreck.

The ship&#x27;s bell of &quot;Yukon&quot; is currently located in the Yukon Legislative Building.

<text>Nicholas Lea (born Nicholas Christopher Herbert; June 22, 1962) is a Canadian actor known for his portrayal of Alex Krycek on &quot;The X-Files&quot; and of Tom Foss on &quot;Kyle XY&quot;.

==Life and career==
Lea was born in New Westminster, British Columbia. He attended Prince of Wales Secondary School where he graduated in 1980.

Lea&#x27;s first major role was on the TV series &quot;The Commish&quot; where he played Officer Enrico Caruso from 1991 to 1994. It was during this time that he had a minor guest role in a first-season episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; called &quot;Gender Bender&quot;. The producers were impressed by his performance and when, in the second season, he auditioned for the role of turncoat FBI agent Alex Krycek, he was successful.

Lea guest starred in eleven episodes from 1994 to 1996 and became a popular character amongst fans. Because of his character&#x27;s willingness to switch sides, he was known as the &#x27;ratboy&#x27;. In the season three episode &quot;Apocrypha,&quot; Krycek was left to die in an abandoned missile silo with an alien ship. This allowed Lea to take a starring role in the series &quot;Once a Thief&quot;—which followed on from the 1996 John Woo film—alongside Ivan Sergei. The series was cancelled after one season. Lea continued to play Krycek, who became a nemesis not just of Mulder and Scully but particularly of A.D. Skinner (Mitch Pileggi).

Lea co-starred with Lau Ching-Wan, Theresa Lee and Bif Naked in the Hong Kong-Canadian film &quot;Lunch with Charles&quot; in 2001.

In 2006, Lea had a role on ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;Kyle XY&quot; (26 episodes) playing Tom Foss, Kyle&#x27;s tutor, and was one of the lead actors (playing Ethan McKaye) on the Canadian TV series &quot;Whistler&quot;. He was also that series&#x27; associate producer. He did not return to &quot;Whistler&quot; for its second season in 2007.

He has guest starred in shows such as &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; (3 episodes), &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Burn Notice&quot;, &quot;Sliders&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;&quot; (4 episodes) (as Catherine Willows&#x27; boyfriend) and &quot;Men in Trees&quot; (10 episodes) (as Eric, the minister). Nicholas has also guest starred in the ABC remake of the sci-fi series &quot;V&quot;. He is also a member of the board of directors for the Lyric School of Acting in Vancouver.

Lea appeared in the film &quot;Guido Superstar: The Rise of Guido&quot;, starring, produced, and directed by Silvio Pollio, including Lea, John Cassini, Terry Chen, and Michael Eklund. The film screened at the 2010 Vancouver International Film Festival. In 2012 he portrayed Eliot Ness who formed the law enforcement group The Untouchables in the &quot;Supernatural&quot; episode &quot;Time after Time&quot;. Also in 2012, Lea starred in the movie &quot;The Philadelphia Experiment&quot; as Bill Gardner in the lead role. Lea had a minor role on &quot;Arrow&quot; as Mark Francis, who was Moira Queen&#x27;s campaign manager. He appeared in three episodes.

<text>Little Johnny jokes are about a small boy who naively poses questions and makes statements that are very embarrassing to his &quot;grownup&quot; listeners (such as parents and teachers), and has a very straightforward way of thinking. At times he is well educated in the terminology of sex, while at others he is all too innocent.

<doc id="1078913" wikidata="Q335281" url="?curid=1078913" title="36th Chess Olympiad">
<text>The 36th [[Chess Olympiad]] (; ), organized by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs (FIDE) and comprising an open and a women&#x27;s tournament, as well as several events designed to promote the game of chess, took place between October 14 and October 31, 2004, in Calvià on the Spanish island of Mallorca. There were 129 teams in the open event and 87 in the women&#x27;s event. In total, 1204 players were registered (some of whom did not play, though).

Both tournament sections were officiated by international arbiter Ignatius Leong (Singapore). Teams were paired across the 14 rounds of competition according to the Swiss system. The open division was played over four boards per round, whilst the women&#x27;s was played over three. In the event of a draw, the tie-break was decided by 1. The Buchholz system; 2. Match points; 3. The Sonneborn-Berger system; and 4. The Median Buchholz system.

The time control for each game permitted each player 90 minutes for all their moves, with an additional 30 seconds increment for each player after each move, beginning with the first.

==Open event==

The open division was contested by 129 teams representing 125 nations. Spain, as hosts, fielded three teams, whilst the &quot;International Braille Chess Association&quot; (IBCA) and the &quot;International Physically Disabled Chess Association&quot; (IPCA) each provided one squad.

Led by first board Vasyl Ivanchuk, the seventh highest-rated player at the tournament, who recorded 9½ points over 13 rounds, and second reserve Sergey Karjakin who, aged just 14 years, won 6 of his 7 games (surrendering a draw only to American Gregory Kaidanov), Ukraine scored all four possible points in each of their first three matches before &quot;only&quot; defeating Russia 2½-1½ in the fourth round, eventually accumulating a nearly insurmountable three-point lead after the penultimate round. The Ukrainian team nevertheless scored three points against France and claimed their first title, three points ahead of Russia, who had entered the tournament as the top seed, having brought four of the tournament&#x27;s nine highest-rated players, and as defending six-time champions.

Armenia, one of just four teams to draw a match with Ukraine, paced by second board Levon Aronian, who did not lose in 12 games, and third board Rafael Vaganian, who scored 8½ points in 11 games, lost 1½-2½ to Russia in the eighth round. Ultimately, on the strength of a 3½-½ final round defeat of Georgia, they tied Russia&#x27;s 36½ points. Armenia were placed after Russia, though, on the Buchholz tie-breaker system employed by the Olympiad, and finished, as in the previous Olympiad, with the bronze medals. Hosts Spain, led by Alexei Shirov, just managed to squeeze into the top ten.

Notable absentees from the tournament were the no. 1 player in the world, Garry Kasparov, as well as classical World Champion Vladimir Kramnik and his challenger Peter Leko, who were just finishing their championship match (Kramnik retained his title with a 7–7 tie). FIDE Champion Rustam Kasimdzhanov was present, however, and led Uzbekistan to 14th place by going undefeated in his 8 games (+4-0=4).
:

1 Bermuda actually scored 22 and Papua New Guinea 23 points, but because some of their players refused to submit to doping tests, the points scored by those players were deducted from the final scores: 3½ points from Bermuda and 7½ from Papua New Guinea.

===Group prizes===

In addition to the overall medals, prizes were given out to the best teams in five different seeding groups—in other words, the teams who exceeded their seeding the most. Overall medal winners were not eligible for group prizes.

===Individual medals===

* Performance rating: Baadur Jobava 2842
* Board 1: Evgenij Ermenkov 10½ / 12 = 87.5%
* Board 2: Mohamed Tissir 7½ / 9 = 83.3%
* Board 3: Rafael Vaganian 9½ / 12 = 79.2%
* Board 4: Baadur Jobava 8½ / 10 = 85.0%
* 1st reserve: Vaidas Sakalauskas 6 / 7 = 85.7%
* 2nd reserve: Sergey Karjakin and Ibrahim Chahrani 6½ / 7 = 92.9%

==Women&#x27;s event==

The women&#x27;s division was contested by 87 teams representing 84 nations. Spain, as hosts, fielded two teams, whilst the &quot;International Braille Chess Association&quot; (IBCA) and the &quot;International Physically Disabled Chess Association&quot; (IPCA) each provided one squad.

China, led by first board Xie Jun (ex-World Champion) and second board Xu Yuhua (future champion), entered the competition as top seed and defending triple champions and quickly took the lead, conceding just two draws in their first five matches. They then defeated the silver and bronze medallists from the previous Olympiad, Russia and Poland (each 2–1), in the sixth and eighth rounds, respectively. Eventually they carried a six-point lead into a tenth round match with second placed United States.

Susan Polgar (another ex-World Champion), who entered the tournament as the second highest-rated player and achieved the best performance rating of all, drew Xie Jun, while Irina Krush won her second board game against Xu Yuhua. A draw by Anna Zatonskih against Zhao Xue gave the Americans a 2–1 win over the Chinese team. In rounds eleven and twelve, China drew Hungary and lost to Georgia, whilst the US team defeated Slovakia and then scored a 2½-½ victory over Hungary, drawing within three points of China with two rounds remaining. China, though, defeated sixth-seed India and 12th-seed Slovakia in the final two rounds, scoring four points to preserve what was ultimately a three-point win and to clinch the Vera Menchik Trophy for a fourth consecutive time.

Second-seed Russia were led by Nadezhda Kosintseva, who won top honours on the first reserve board for scoring 10 points in 12 rounds. The Russians were only in eighth place after ten rounds but had advanced to fourth place entering the penultimate round, where they faced Georgia, who they trailed by half a point. Although first board Maya Chiburdanidze (ex-World Champion) and second board Nana Dzagnidze, who both scored 8½ points for their team over the event, drew their matches, third board Lela Javakhishvili lost to Kosintseva, giving the Russian team a half-point lead over Georgia; although Georgia defeated Ukraine 2½-½ in the final round, Russia managed to secure two points against France, equalling Georgia&#x27;s total and winning the bronze medals on tie-breaks.

Newly crowned World Champion Antoaneta Stefanova disappointed as captain of the Bulgarian team, scoring only 5½ points in 11 games. Bulgaria eventually finished in 14th place.

==Overall title==

The Nona Gaprindashvili Trophy is awarded to the nation that has the best average rank in the open and women&#x27;s divisions. Where two or more teams are tied, they are ordered by best single finish in either division and then by total number of points scored.

The trophy, named after the former women&#x27;s World Champion (1961–78), was created by FIDE in 1997.

==Controversies==

===Azmaiparashvili incident===

Prior to the closing ceremony of the Olympiad, FIDE vice president Zurab Azmaiparashvili attempted to ascend the stage in order to inform the presenter of the Nona Gaprindashvili Trophy that the latter ought more clearly to explain Gaprindashvili&#x27;s contributions to the game of chess (Gaprindashvili had been World Champion for 17 years). Security officers, in conjunction with local police, did not permit Azmaiparashvili access to tournament organizers, and a struggle ensued after which Azmaiparashvili, having sustained several injuries, was arrested by the local law enforcement. He secured his release on bail for € 500 after having been held for 40 hours, and the charges against him were later dropped.

Azmaiparashvili and FIDE averred that Azmaiparashvili was detained and physically accosted despite he had properly and &quot;clearly [displayed] his VIP credentials&quot;, whilst representatives of the Spanish chess federation (&quot;Federación Española de Ajedrez&quot;) and tournament organizers blamed Azmaiparashvili for the incident, saying that he &quot;without any previous provocation, assaulted [an] agent with a head butt to [the] mouth&quot;.

===Drug testing===

Having been formally recognized by the International Olympic Committee in 1999, in preparation for prospective inclusion in future iterations of the Olympic Games, FIDE implemented (in 2001) doping restrictions consistent with those adopted by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Two players, Shaun Press of Papua New Guinea and Bobby Miller of Bermuda, refused, for various reasons, to submit urine samples for analysis. Both players appeared before the FIDE Doping Hearing panel, which decided to cancel the players&#x27; performances (Press had scored 7½ points in 14 games, while Miller had scored 3½ points in 9 games), reducing the final score of Papua New Guinea to 15½ (from 23) and that of Bermuda to 18½ (from 22).

==Associated events==

Concomitant to the tournaments were several chess-related events planned by the organizing committee of the Olympiad, some under the auspices of FIDE; the events were known collectively as the &quot;First Chess Festival Calvià 2004&quot;. Within the festival were held simultaneous exhibitions, game demonstrations and lectures by top Spanish players, and several secondary tournaments, including one for amateur players, a rapid chess event for players aged under 16, and one for senior players.

Chess classes were introduced into the primary and secondary schools, as well as senior centers, in and around Calvià in an effort to promote chess generally, and chess films were screened on the beaches of Calvià every weeknight during the Olympiad. Chess-oriented art was displayed at an &quot;International Chess Fair&quot;, with prizes for top works awarded by a jury.

<doc id="1078914" wikidata="Q2036706" url="?curid=1078914" title="Otakou">
<text>Otakou ( ) is a settlement within the boundaries of the city of Dunedin, New Zealand. It is located 25 kilometres from the city centre at the eastern end of Otago Peninsula, close to the entrance of Otago Harbour. Though a small fishing village, Otakou is important in the history of Otago for several reasons. The settlement is the modern centre and traditional home of the Ōtākou (assembly) of Ngāi Tahu. In 1946 Otakou Fisheries was founded in the township; this was later to become a major part of the Otago fishing industry.

==History==
The name is thought to come from Māori words meaning either &quot;single village&quot; or &quot;place of red earth&quot;. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the place was a prominent Māori settlement, and it is still the site of Otago&#x27;s most important (meeting ground). By the early 19th century, the three Māori of Ngāi Tahu, Kāti Māmoe and Waitaha had blended into a single tribal entity. The Treaty of Waitangi was signed nearby in 1840 on the &quot;H.M.S Herald&quot; by two important chiefs, who were descended from all three tribes.

Prior to the standardisation of Māori spelling in the 1840s, the name was written as &quot;Otago&quot;, reflecting its pronunciation in a local southern Māori dialect. This prestandardised form was adopted by European settlers as the name for the surrounding area, the Otago region, and it is commonly mistaken as a European corruption of . The name originally referred to the channel off Wellers Rock but was transferred to the lower harbour as a whole, the port, the nearby Māori settlements and the Weller brothers&#x27; whaling establishment, one of the region&#x27;s oldest European settlements, which had been founded in 1831. The old Māori names for the Māori settlements were Te Ruatitiko, Tahakopa, Omate and Ohinetu.

In December 1817 the &quot;Sophia&quot;, a Hobart sealing ship captained by James Kelly, anchored in the waters of the harbour near Otakou. A small group of men, including Captain Kelly, took a rowing boat around Heyward Point to visit Whareakeake, then the site of a Māori (village), where one of the men, William Tucker, had a house and a business selling . For reasons that remain speculative, the encounter turned violent and three of Kelly&#x27;s men, including Tucker, were killed. The survivors rowed back to the &quot;Sophia&quot; but, according to Kelly&#x27;s account of the event, found her boarded by Māori from Otakou and retook her in a bloody fight. Historians caution that Kelly&#x27;s account, made to justify the actions he took, exaggerates the danger he and his men were in. Kelly destroyed multiple canoes and set fire to &quot;the beautiful city of Otago&quot;, which was almost certainly Otakou, although the at Whareakeake was also burned and abandoned around this time, which some historians believe to have been Kelly&#x27;s doing. This incident is treated as an episode in the ongoing state of lawless conflict known as the Sealers&#x27; War.

==Present use==
Otakou remains an important centre of Ngāi Tahu life, as the location of Ōtākou Marae. It is a of Ngāi Tahu and the branch of Te Rūnanga o Ōtākou, and includes the Tamatea (meeting house).

Otakou is located close to Taiaroa Head, the site of an albatross colony and other wildlife such as seals and penguins. Local Māori still call Taiaroa Head by its original name, , which was also the name of the (fortification) established there around 1750 and still occupied by Māori in the 1840s, before the land was taken by the Government under the Public Works Act for building the lighthouse and the fortifications used during the Russian Scare of the 1880s.

==Demographics==
Statistics New Zealand describes Ōtākou-Harington Point as a rural settlement which covers , and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2. It is part of the much larger Otago Peninsula statistical area.
Ōtākou-Harington Point had a population of 192 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 30 people (18.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 21 people (12.3%) since the 2006 census. There were 102 households, comprising 99 males and 90 females, giving a sex ratio of 1.1 males per female.

Ethnicities were 81.2% European/Pākehā, 32.8% Māori, 3.1% Pasifika, 3.1% Asian, and 1.6% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 59.4% had no religion, 31.2% were Christian and 4.7% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 30 (17.2%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 30 (17.2%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $19,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 12 people (6.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 48 (27.6%) people were employed full-time, 36 (20.7%) were part-time, and 9 (5.2%) were unemployed.

<doc id="1078916" wikidata="Q848394" url="?curid=1078916" title="Lateran Palace">
<text>The Apostolic Palace of the Lateran (; ), informally the Lateran Palace (), is an ancient palace of the Roman Empire and later the main papal residence in Rome.

Located on Saint John&#x27;s Square in Lateran on the Caelian Hill, the palace is adjacent to the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, the cathedral church of Rome. The wealthy Lateran (&quot;Laterani&quot;) family held the palace estate during the Roman Empire, and the estate eventually came into the hands of the Emperor Constantine the Great who gifted it to Pope Damasus I who was residing at the Basilica of Santa Pudenziana. 

From the fourth century, the palace was the principal residence of the popes, and continued so for about a thousand years until the Apostolic Residence ultimately moved to the nearby Vatican. The palace is now used by the Vatican Historical Museum, which illustrates the history of the Papal States. The palace also houses the offices of the Diocese of Rome, as well as the residential apartments of the Cardinal Vicar, the pope&#x27;s delegate for the daily administration of the diocese. Until 1970, the palace was also home to the important collections of the Lateran Museum, now dispersed among it and other parts of the Vatican Museums.

The building that stands today, after many waves of construction and destruction since Roman times, is nearly all from the rebuilding begun in the 1580s to the designs of Domenico Fontana. This is a rectangular building with a central courtyard, higher but less sprawling and so smaller than the medieval palace, of which only fragments remain, themselves largely rebuilt later. The &quot;Leonian Triclinium&quot;, the end wall of a great medieval hall, and the &quot;Santa Scala&quot; or &quot;Holy steps&quot; are the largest of these. These are now incorporated into a separate building across the square from the main palace.

Following the Lateran Treaty of 1929, the palace and adjoining basilica are extraterritorial properties of the Holy See.

==History==

===Pre-papal use===
The site on which the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano sits was occupied during the early Roman Empire by the &quot;domus&quot; of the Plautii Laterani family. The Laterani served as administrators for several emperors; their ancestor Lucius Sextius Lateranus is said to have been the first plebeian to attain the rank of consul, in 366 BC. One of the Laterani, Consul-designate Plautius Lateranus, became famous for being accused by Nero of conspiracy against the emperor. The accusation resulted in the confiscation and redistribution of his properties.

===Constantinian era===

The &quot;Domus Laterani&quot; came into the possession of the emperor when Constantine I married his second wife Fausta, sister of Maxentius. Around 312, Constantine had razed the imperial horse-guards barracks adjoining the palace, which was known as &quot;Domus Faustae&quot; or &quot;House of Fausta&quot; by this time; the &quot;equites singulares&quot; &quot;Augusti&quot; had supported Maxentius against Constantine. He commissioned the construction of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano on the site. 

The &quot;Domus Laterani&quot; was eventually given to the Bishop of Rome by Constantine I. It is believed that this happened during the pontificate of Pope Miltiades, in time to host a synod of bishops in 313 that was convened to challenge the Donatists.

===Medieval Palace===
As Byzantium grew less able to help prevent Lombard incursions, the papacy became more independent of the Empire. Prior to the early eighth century, the residence of the bishops of Rome was not called a palace, but rather the &quot;Lateran patriarchate&quot; (&quot;patriarchium)&quot;. The incentive to refurbish the Lateran patriarchate as a true palace was to create an imperial residence from which the pope could exercise not only spiritual but also temporal authority.

The pope&#x27;s palace at the Lateran in Rome was extensively added to in the late eighth century by Pope Hadrian I (772–95) and Pope Leo III (795–816). Pope Hadrian I restructured the portico by the entrance staircase (Zaccaria&#x27;s portico) and erected another tower next to it, which functioned as residential space. This portico was used to distribute alms and was also the location of the statue of the Capitoline Wolf and the &quot;Lex de imperio Vespasiani&quot; tables.

Pope Leo III built two &quot;triclinia&quot; (the first known simply as the &quot;Triclinium&quot; or &quot;triclinium maius&quot; while the second one became known as &quot;Aula Concilii&quot;) around 800 to serve as the heart of papal ceremonial. Architecturally they were reminiscent of Byzantine imperial buildings in Constantinople. Both triclinia were ornate with mosaics and fountains, and were the location of papal ceremonies, banquets and meetings. The decorations had an explicitly political theme, and they were meant to be a symbol of papal power and authority. 

The &quot;Leonian Triclinium&quot; or &quot;triclinium maius&quot; was one of the most famous halls of the ancient palace and was the state banqueting hall, lined with mosaics. It was a two story structure, 50m long from end to end. The upper floor was constituted of a large 26 meter long main chamber with a main apse at the end and one apse on each side, and a rectangular entrance antechamber, maybe with a portico. Frescoes covered the two apses projecting the main chamber and the two apses in the antechamber, while the main apse was covered in a mosaic and hosted the papal throne. Nothing remains of this, but in 1743 copies of the mosaics were made from drawings and placed in a specially built structure opposite the palace. The existing structure is not ancient, but a representation of the original mosaics is preserved in a three-part mosaic: In the centre Christ gives their mission to the Apostles; on the left he gives the keys to St. Peter and the Labarum to Constantine; while on the right St. Peter gives the stole to Leo III and the standard to Charlemagne, an image meant to represent the Frankish king&#x27;s duty to protect the Church. 

The &quot;second triclinium&quot; built by Leo III, also known as the &quot;Aula Concilii&quot; (&quot;Hall of the Council&quot; or Sala del Concilio in Italian), was situated next to the basilica and in perpendicularly to it. It was a magnificent oblong hall (53 m long by 13 wide) with eleven apses, the major apse on one end and five on each side. The side apses had a diameter of 6.7 meters and were 2.34 meters apart, while the end ones were 4.47 meters away from the front and end walls. A large Porphyry fountain was placed in front of the main apse, spouting jets of water from pressurized pipes of the restored Aqua Claudia, a technical marvel meant to impress visitors. Each of the 10 lateral apses held accubita for banquets, on the model of the reception hall of the 19 accubita in the Great Palace of Constantinople. The main apse was decorated with a mosaic showing Christ and Mary with Saints Peter and Paul and three other figures, while each of the ten lateral apses was decorated with frescoes depicting an apostle preaching to the gentiles. On the left of the main apse was a staircase that led to the basilica. The hall was adorned with columns, pilasters, a floor in opus sectile. A drawing by Pompeo Ugonio (BAV, Cod. Barb. lat. 2160, fol.157v) survives as evidence of its structure and ornamentation.

Leo III and his successor Paschal I (817–24) decorated the &quot;Sancta Sanctorum&quot; (“Holy of Holies”, the private papal chapel) with new jeweled reliquaries and a reliquary chest modeled on the Ark of the Covenant, which stored some of Rome’s most precious relics. Around the 820s the Liber Pontificalis starts calling the complex a palace, &quot;palatium&quot;.

The private apartments of the popes in this palace were situated between the &quot;triclinium&quot; and the city walls. It later was called &quot;Aula Concilii&quot; (&quot;Hall of the Council&quot;) due to its role as a place of meetings.
In the tenth century Sergius III restored the palace after a disastrous fire, and later it was greatly embellished by Innocent III. This was the period of its greatest magnificence, when Dante speaks of it as beyond all human achievements. At this time the centre of the piazza was occupied by the palace and tower of the Annibaldi family.

After the Great Schism of 1054, the Lateran palace was the venue of the first ecumenical council to be held in Western Europe in 1123. Four other ecumenical councils (in 1139, in 1179, in 1213 &amp; in 1512) were also held in this site. 

Between this palace and the Lateran basilica was the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, which at the time was erroneously believed to represent the Christian Emperor Constantine (which association probably accounted for its preservation). A copy of the equestrian statue is now placed in the centre of the Capitoline Square while the original has been safely preserved for display in the Capitoline Museums.

Boniface VIII added the Loggia delle Benedizioni to the northern side of the Aula Concilii.

In its place, the Lateran obelisk was erected. Originally commissioned by the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Thuthmosis III, it was completed by his grandson, Thuthmosis IV. At 32.18 m (45.70 m including the base) it is the tallest obelisk in Rome and the largest standing ancient Egyptian obelisk in the world, weighing over 230 tons. Following the annexation of Egypt to the Empire, it was taken from the temple of Amun in Karnak and brought to Alexandria with another obelisk by Constantius II. From there it was brought on its own to Rome in 357 to decorate the &quot;spina&quot; of the Circus Maximus. The dedication on the base, however, gives the glory to Constantine I, not to his son who brought it to Rome.

===Avignon Papacy===
The fall of the palace from this position of glory was the result of the departure of the popes from Rome during the Avignon Papacy.

Two destructive fires, in 1307 and 1361, did irreparable harm, and although vast sums were sent from Avignon for the rebuilding, the palace never again attained its former splendour. The palace had Gothic architectural elements at this point. When the popes returned to Rome they resided first at Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, then at Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore, and lastly fixed their residence at the Vatican. St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, also built by Constantine, had until then served primarily as a pilgrimage church. Sixtus V, more concerned with rationalized urban planning than the preservation of antiquities, then destroyed what still remained of the ancient palace of the Lateran in 1586 preserving only the &quot;Sancta Sanctorum&quot;, and erected the present much smaller edifice in its place, designed by his favorite architect Domenico Fontana.

===16th-century building===
The architect he employed, immediately upon his election, was Domenico Fontana, who was engaged in alterations to the basilica at the same time. Fontana&#x27;s strong, restrained style was influenced by Giacomo Vignola and modeled upon Palazzo Farnese for its regular and harmonious if somewhat bland major façade. Fontana&#x27;s sound engineering basis and power of coordinating a complicated architectural program on a tightly constrained site, which Sixtus urged forward at top speed, have been considered remarkable.

A notice on 29 August 1589 announced that the work had been completed: &quot;A great palace in Piazza Lateranese has been brought to completion by Sixtus V.&quot; Fontana reapplied motifs of the Lateran Palace in the part of the Vatican Palace containing the present papal apartments, which he undertook later, and in his additions to the Quirinal Palace. The east front was finished under Clement XII, who surmounted it with his coat-of-arms in 1735.

From the old Lateran constructions three monuments survive, two of which are located in one building built by Domenico Fontana in 1589 opposite the Lateran Basilica. These monuments are the Scala Santa and the Chapel of the Sancta Sanctorum.

==Modern use==
The Lateran remained in a suburban environment, surrounded by gardens and vineyards, until the growth of modern Rome in the later nineteenth century. Its site was considered unhealthy in Rome&#x27;s malarial summers, however. In the late seventeenth century, Innocent XII located, in a part of it, a hospice for orphans who were set to work in a little silk manufactory. In the nineteenth century, Gregory XVI and Pius IX founded at the Lateran a museum of religious art and pagan culture for overflow from the Vatican galleries.

In 1925 Pius XI established an ethnographic museum devoted to artifacts sent back by missionaries. On 11 February 1929, the Lateran Treaty was signed here, at last regulating the relations between the Holy See and the Italian State. It established that both the basilica and the Lateran Palace were extraterritorial properties of the Holy See, enjoying privileges similar to foreign embassies on Italian soil.

During the Second World War, the Lateran and its related buildings provided a safe haven from the Nazis and Italian Fascists for numbers of Jews and other refugees. Among those who found shelter there were Alcide De Gasperi, Pietro Nenni, Ivanoe Bonomi and others. The Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul and the sixty orphan refugees they cared for were ordered to leave their convent on the Via Carlo Emanuele. The Sisters of Maria Bambina, who staffed the kitchen at the Pontifical Major Roman Seminary at the Lateran offered a wing of their convent. The grounds also housed Italian soldiers.

Fathers Vincenzo Fagiolo and Pietro Palazzini, vice-rector of the seminary, were recognized by Yad Vashem for their efforts to assist Jews.

===Seat of the Vicariate of Rome===
Pope John XXIII returned to the palace some pastoral functions by fixing here the seat of the vicariate and offices of the Diocese of Rome. He removed the collections of the Lateran Museum to the Vatican. Since 1987 the Lateran Palace has housed the Museo Storico Vaticano, which opened in 1991 and illustrates the history of the Papal States.

On 27 July 1993, a bomb explosion devastated the facade of the Rome Vicariate at the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran. The attack is widely assumed to have been the work of the Italian Mafia, a warning against Pope John Paul II&#x27;s frequent anti-Mafia statements. Repairs were completed in January 1996.

The palace houses the offices of the Vicariate of Rome and the living quarters of the cardinal vicar.

Tourists can visit the papal apartments, usually in the morning.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood (2010)&quot;, the basilica of the palace is presented as a dilapidated structure which holds a scroll of Romulus.

<text>Melinda McGraw (born October 25, 1968) is an American actress. She has appeared in movies such as &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008), &quot;Wrongfully Accused&quot; (1998), and &quot;Skateland&quot; (2010), and is also known for her television performances on &quot;Mad Men&quot;, &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot;, &quot;X-Files&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and &quot;NCIS&quot;.

==Early life==
McGraw was born in Nicosia, Cyprus, to American parents.

The youngest of three daughters, she grew up in Cambridge and Dover in the Boston area. Her father served as a diplomat for the Agency of International Development before becoming an executive with a major hotel in Boston. She attended the Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols School in Cambridge and got her start in acting with the Boston Children&#x27;s Theater.

After attending Bennington College, McGraw was accepted to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (one of only seven women admitted in her year). Theatrical performances in the West End and elsewhere in Britain followed, among them &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, &quot;The Foreigner&quot; and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

She guest-starred in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot; episode &quot;Crush&quot; as Samantha Copeland. She had a recurring role as seductive adulteress Bobbie Barrett in the second season of AMC&#x27;s &quot;Mad Men&quot;. McGraw co-starred with Kelsey Grammer on the ABC sitcom &quot;Hank&quot; before its cancellation on November 11, 2009. She enjoyed a recurring role as Erin, Scott Bakula&#x27;s love interest, on the TNT original series &quot;Men of a Certain Age&quot; in 2010–11. In 2011 and 2012, she made guest appearances in the 9th season of &quot;NCIS&quot; in the episodes &quot;Devil&#x27;s Triangle&quot;, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Trifecta&quot; and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Triad&quot; as Diane Sterling, an ex-wife of both Leroy Jethro Gibbs and Tobias Fornell. In season 12 of the series, her character&#x27;s arc was closed when she was murdered in the episode &quot;Check&quot;. McGraw appeared again as Diane in 2019, but as a ghost in the episode “Daughters” (season 16). In 2013 she appeared in ABC series &quot;Scandal&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Bashaw&quot; (SS/SSK/AGSS-241), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bashaw. Between 10 March 1944 and 29 April 1945, she completed six war patrols in the Celebes, Philippine, and South China Seas during World War II. &quot;Bashaw&quot; sank three Japanese merchant vessels totaling 19,269 gross register tons as well as several small craft. She later served in the Vietnam War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bashaw&quot; was laid down on 4 December 1942 by Electric Boat Company, Groton, Conn. She was launched on 25 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Florence Ives, wife of Captain Norman S. Ives (killed 2 August 1944 near Dol-de-Bretagne, France, while commanding a naval patrol), and commissioned on 25 October 1943, Lieutenant Commander Richard E. Nichols in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===

Following shakedown training in Long Island Sound, &quot;Bashaw&quot; proceeded south to provide services for the Fleet Sound School at Key West, Florida. She ended 1943 in training off Florida.

On 9 January 1944, &quot;Bashaw&quot; got underway for duty in the Pacific Ocean. She transited the Panama Canal on 14 January and exercised with the submarines and off the Panama Canal Zone before beginning a voyage to New Guinea. She reported to Commander, Task Force (TF) 72, at Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 3 March 1944.

====First war patrol====

After voyage repairs and provisioning, &quot;Bashaw&quot; and the submarine got underway on 10 March 1944 to patrol off the Palau Islands in the hope of intercepting Japanese ships trying to escape through Toagel Mlungui Pass. On the night of 21 March 1944, &quot;Bashaw&quot; conducted a surface radar attack on what she believed to be a Japanese submarine tender. Firing six torpedoes, &quot;Bashaw&quot; scored one hit, but she was unable to regain position to sink what proved to be the salvage ship . While the Japanese destroyer screened the operation, the destroyer towed the crippled ship to safety.

On 13 April 1944, a U.S. Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator patrol bomber mistakenly bombed &quot;Bashaw&quot; in the Pacific Ocean west-southwest of Truk Atoll at . &quot;Bashaw&quot; submerged and avoided damage.

On 27 April 1944, &quot;Bashaw&quot; attacked and damaged three Japanese trawlers with gunfire. On 10 May, she concluded her patrol with her arrival at Brisbane, Australia, for a refit.

====Second war patrol====

&quot;Bashaw&quot; got underway on 27 May 1944 for her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the waters around Mindanao in the Philippines. During the patrol, she made only one contact, when she attacked a convoy between Halmahera and Taland Island on 25 June 1944. Before the night was over, she scored three torpedo hits on &quot;Yamamiya Maru&quot;, a 6,440-gross register ton Imperial Japanese Army cargo ship, and sank her. On 16 July 1944, &quot;Bashaw&quot; moored alongside the submarine tender in Seeadler Harbor at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands for a refit.

====Third war patrol====

After training exercises, &quot;Bashaw&quot; stood out of Seeadler Harbor for her third war patrol on 7 August 1944, bound for the Mindanao Sea and Moro Gulf in Philippine waters. Opportunities to attack proved scarce but, on 8 September 1944 she approached what turned out to be the Japanese cargo ship &quot;Yanagigawa Maru&quot;. &quot;Bashaw&quot; fired a six-torpedo salvo from periscope depth and scored three hits that sent &quot;Yanagigawa Maru&quot; to the bottom. She completed her patrol by providing lifeguard services during carrier air strikes against Cagayan, Mindanao. On 9 September 1944, she assisted four airplanes to sink a 225-gross register ton interisland supply ship loaded with drums of fuel oil. &quot;Bashaw&quot; rescued one of the ship&#x27;s crew members and later turned him over to the authorities in Australia. &quot;Bashaw&quot; also rescued an American fighter pilot on 19 September 1944 before ending her patrol at Brisbane on 4 October 1944.

====Fourth war patrol====

Following a refit, &quot;Bashaw&quot; began her fourth war patrol on 27 October 1944 in a coordinated attack group which also included the submarines &quot;Flounder&quot; (SS-251) and . They proceeded to the coast of Japanese-occupied French Indochina to patrol in the South China Sea, but found meager pickings. Finally, a small Japanese tanker crossed &quot;Bashaw&quot;′s track on 21 November 1944. &quot;Bashaw&quot; fired four torpedoes and scored one hit. The lone hit failed to damage the tanker severely enough to sink her, and &quot;Bashaw&quot; was unable to reach a firing position again. Continuing the patrol, &quot;Bashaw&quot; sighted a large and heavily escorted Japanese task force on 14 December 1944. Although unable to attack, she reported the contact. On 25 December 1944, &quot;Bashaw&quot; made a submerged transit of Lombok Strait while returning to Australia, where she arrived at Fremantle on 31 December 1944. She began the year 1945 undergoing refit alongside &quot;Euryale&quot;.

====Fifth war patrol====

&quot;Bashaw&quot; stood out of Fremantle on 26 January 1945 and set course for her designated patrol area along the east coast of Hainan Island in the eastern part of the Gulf of Tonkin and off the northeastern coast of French Indochina. &quot;Bashaw&quot; sank one small coastal freighter on 10 February 1945, then joined the submarine in pursuing another, which they sank with gunfire. On 25 February 1945, &quot;Bashaw&quot; mounted several unsuccessful attacks against a small cargo ship. &quot;Flasher&quot; later finished off the ship. On 27 February 1945, Bashaw again worked with &quot;Flasher&quot; in sinking two &quot;sea trucks&quot; and damaging two others.

On 5 March 1944, a heavy fog hindered &quot;Bashaw&quot;′s patrolling until radar picked up a contact. She approached in daylight, surfaced, and fired six torpedoes at what turned out to be the 10,000-gross register ton tanker &quot;Ryoei Maru&quot;. Two torpedoes scored, and &quot;Bashaw&quot;&#x27;s crew cheered as &quot;Ryoei Maru&quot; sank. On 6 March, &quot;Bashaw&quot; sank another &quot;sea truck,&quot; then made for Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines, where she moored alongside the submarine tender on 12 March 1945.

====Sixth war patrol====

Bashaw got underway on 27 March 1945 for her sixth war patrol, which she also conducted off French Indochina and Hainan Island. Japanese forces were stretched thin, and she found no worthy targets. On 29 April 1945, she stood into Subic Bay.

====May–August 1945====
At Subic Bay, &quot;Bashaw&quot; received orders to continue on to Mare Island, California, for overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard. Upon completion of overhaul, she departed the Mare Island Navy Yard for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 13 August 1945. During her voyage, hostilities with Japan ended on 15 August 1945.

===Post-World War II===
====1945–1949====
Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 22 August 1945, &quot;Bashaw&quot; received orders to return to Mare Island Navy Yard to prepare for inactivation. On 5 September 1945, she arrived there and began her pre-inactivation overhaul, going into commission in reserve there on 24 November 1945. She remained berthed at Mare Island until her status was changed to out of commission in reserve on 20 June 1949, after which she was laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

====1951–1969====
&quot;Bashaw&quot; was recommissioned on 3 April 1951 and operated from San Diego, California, along the United States West Coast in local operations and training until 10 May 1952. She then was placed out of commission in reserve at Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco, California, where from May 1952 to March 1953, she underwent conversion to a Type IT anti-submarine &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot;. Accordingly, she was reclassified SSK-241 on 18 February 1953.

After the completion of her conversion, &quot;Bashaw&quot; was recommissioned on 28 March 1953 and reported to Submarine Division 33 (SubDiv 33) at San Diego. From March to August 1954, she made a Far Eastern cruise. During 1955, she took part in several submarine exercises, including one major exercise in the Hawaiian Islands area, before beginning an overhaul at Hunters Point on 28 June 1955.

When her overhaul was completed five months later, &quot;Bashaw&quot; was ordered to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. There she commenced a career of providing training services to antisubmarine warfare forces, deploying to the Far East as operational needs arose and participating in fleet exercises for readiness training. From January to August 1956, she conducted her second post-World War II tour of the Far East, completing it on 14 August 1956 with her arrival at the Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor.

Lieutenant Don Walsh relinquished command of &quot;Bashaw&quot; in 1959 to serve aboard the bathyscaphe &quot;Trieste&quot;. In January 1960, Walsh and Jacques Piccard made a record descent in &quot;Trieste&quot; to the bottom of the Challenger Deep, the deepest known point of the seabed of Earth.

&quot;Bashaw&quot; reverted to her original designation, SS-241, in August 1959. She was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-241, on 1 September 1962. In October 1962, she ended a lengthy transpacific training cruise with her arrival at the 1962 World&#x27;s Fair in Seattle, Washington. She returned to Hawaii to enter the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in April 1963 for a four-month overhaul.

&quot;Bashaw&quot; deployed to the Western Pacific in August 1964 after the Gulf of Tonkin incident, in which North Vietnamese Navy torpedo boats confronted the U.S. Navy destroyers on 2 August and may have confronted the destroyer on 4 August. &quot;Bashaw&quot; was one of several submarines alerted for support during retaliatory air strikes on North Vietnam by U.S. forces, but she ended the cruise in October 1964 without incident.

&quot;Bashaw&quot;′s home port reverted to San Diego, but she continued to deploy to the western Pacific in 1965. She patrolled in the Gulf of Tonkin as the American involvement in the Vietnam War escalated. Upon her return to San Diego on 21 December 1965, she resumed antisubmarine warfare training operations until she entered the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard on 16 May 1966 for a four-month overhaul.

&quot;Bashaw&quot; continued her routine of western Pacific deployments alternating with antisubmarine warfare training until the results of an operations readiness inspection on 3 July 1969 determined that she was too old to continue naval service.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Bashaw&quot; was finally decommissioned on 13 September 1969 at San Francisco and struck from the Naval Vessel Register the same day. She was the last &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine to be decommissioned. Sources claim both that she was sunk as a target off Hawaii in July 1972 and that she was sold for scrap to the National Metal and Steel Corporation on 4 August 1972.

==Honors and awards==
* Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal with five battle stars for World War II service
* Korean Service Medal
* Vietnam Service Medal with three service stars for Vietnam War service

==In popular culture ==

The 1978 Donny and Marie Osmond movie &quot;Goin&#x27; Coconuts&quot; includes an underwater picture of &quot;Bashaw&quot;′s wreck in the background of a scene. In the movie&#x27;s plot, the wreck is loaded with gold bars.

<doc id="1078933" wikidata="Q7333623" url="?curid=1078933" title="Right of Magistrates">
<text>The Right of Magistrates (; ) is a 1574 work written by Theodore Beza, and anonymously &quot;published by those from Magdeburg of 1550&quot;, as a polemical contribution to the pamphlet literature of the French Wars of Religion. It emphatically protested against French state tyranny in religious matters, and affirmed the resistance theory that it is legitimate for a people to oppose an unworthy magistracy in a practical manner and if necessary to use weapons and depose them.

<text>I See Good Spirits and I See Bad Spirits is the first studio album by the band My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. It was released in 1988 via Wax Trax!

The band&#x27;s sound was initially an amalgam of heavy dance rhythms, horror film sampling, and quasi-Satanic imagery. Their early recordings were extremely popular in industrial dance clubs. A music video was released for the song, &quot;...And This is What the Devil Does!&quot;, and appears on &quot;The Kult Kollection&quot; DVD. In 2004, the album was remastered and reissued with three bonus tracks, featuring two live tracks recorded on October 28, 1988, at The Riviera, Chicago.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that &quot;the dreary mix of electronic atmospherics, vaguely ominous chants, disco beats and B-movie samples aspires to sleaziness but never breaks (out in) a sweat.&quot;

==Track listing==

<doc id="1078939" wikidata="Q3545325" url="?curid=1078939" title="Branston, Lincolnshire">
<text>Branston is a large village in the civil parish of Branston and Mere, in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England, south-east of Lincoln on the B1188 road to Sleaford. In 2021 it had a population of 4283. It is the principal settlement in the parish of Branston and Mere.

==History==
Neolithic and Bronze Age axes have been found in the village, including ten Bronze Age axes in the grounds of Branston Hall in 1906. Evidence has also been found of a Roman villa or villa farm near Folly Lane: a Roman memorial stone, part of a statue, a bronze candlestick and pottery fragments. The inscription on the Roman memorial stone is incomplete but has been translated as &#x27;In this estate (lie the bones of) Aurelia Concessa, a very pure girl&#x27;.

The 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; records a village population of 350, a figure which stayed relatively stable until the 19th century. In the 19th century the population almost tripled, rising to 1216 in 1901. In the 20th century the population trebled further, to exceed 4000. The character of the village changed much over the second half of the 20th century but Branston has retained much of its historic centre, where the majority of buildings are constructed from local limestone.

The &#x27;Bran&#x27; in &#x27;Branston&#x27; may refer to a leader with the Norse name &#x27;Brandr&#x27;, in which case the name was likely coined during the Danelaw in the 9th–11th centuries, or it could be from the same Saxon root as &#x27;bourne&#x27; in Old English and &#x27;burn&#x27; in Scots, referring to the three streams in the village. In the Domesday book it is listed as Branztune or Branztone. In the Norman Conquest, land in Branston was passed from Haminc (Hemming, a thegn of Blankney) to Walter de Aincurt (a Norman Baron and kinsman of Remigius de Fécamp). In 1219 the De Aincurt estate passed from Oliver De Aincurt to his wife Amabila Camville, who remarried to Henry Le Eueske. Farming in Branston followed an open-field system, with commons for grazing, until Enclosure in 1765.

The village&#x27;s most notable buildings are Branston Hall, built 1884–86 and Branston All Saints&#x27; Church (parts dating to the 11th century). Branston Hall was preceded by Branston old hall, dating to 1735, which burnt down in 1903. There was also a major fire at Branston All Saints Church on Christmas Day in 1962.

Other historic buildings include a rectory house, built in 1765, and a Wesleyan Methodist chapel, built in 1883, which is of Gothic style, previously seated 300 and closed in 1998. An earlier Methodist chapel, beside it, became a Sunday school. A former public primary school on Branston High Street was built in 1873, and preceded by a fee-paying school on Hall Lane, built in 1837. Opposite the church still stands a blacksmith&#x27;s forge.

Two other public houses were once located in the village; The Plough which stood on the High Street opposite the Waggon and Horses, which was demolished in the 1970s to straighten a dangerous bend at the centre of the village, and the Bertie Arms, a small public house on Hall Lane, long ago converted into a private dwelling. The Bertie Arms was named after the family which built Branston old hall. The building now occupied by the Home Guard Club was formerly a hops store. 19th Century communal water pumps have been preserved on Hall Lane and Waterwheel Lane. The village used to have a railway station which was in the parish of Heighington. Before then, Station Road was called Heighington Road. Silver Street was formerly known as Bleak Street.

A war memorial to men of the parish killed in the First World War was erected on the village green in 1920.

In 1921 the civil parish had a population of 1275. The civil parish of Branston was merged with that of Mere to form the present unit on 1 April 1931. In the early 1930s parish occupations included twenty-one farmers and one smallholder, two poultry breeders, a horse dealer, a haulage contractor, two coal dealers, a motor bus proprietor, a cycle dealer, a fried fish dealer, three blacksmiths, a wheelwright, a plumber, two carpenters, a boot maker, two butchers, two grocers, three shopkeepers, two tailors, one of whom ran the post office, and four pub landlords.

Abel Smith Gardens was built on former allotments. In July 1977, more than fifty children from Branston Junior Academy had to go to Lincoln County Hospital after a crop spraying aircraft inadvertently sprayed their playground. The insecticide was a mixture of meta-systox and aphox; organophosphate and carbamate compounds designed to clear crops of aphids. A hotel called Moor Lodge Hotel stood on Moor Lane until it was demolished in 2005 to make way for housing.

==Geography and ecology==
Most of the village is around above sea level. It is built around the shallow valleys of three limestone streams which originate within of the village, at Westfield Farm, at Mere Farm and near Highfield House. These merge and flow northwards, joining the River Witham at Washingborough. Smaller freshwater springs have been found in the valleys.

The bedrock under the village is Jurassic limestone. Fossils in it are mostly marine animals, including ammonites, crinoids and coral, reflecting the fact that the area was under the sea for much of prehistory.

Arable farmland now dominates the surrounding countryside. The main crops are wheat, barley and potatoes. Sheep, horses and pigs are also raised in the village. Wildlife found in the arable fields includes barn owl, linnet and northern lapwing.
A marsh occupies the valley in the middle of the village, part of which is designated a Local Nature Reserve. The marsh is fed by two of the village streams but also probably by freshwater springs. Wildlife found in the local nature reserve, known as Branston Jungle, includes water rail, common frog, blackcap, hops, yellow flag iris and alder. Woodlands surrounding Branston Hall Hotel and within the boundary of the Village Conservation Area feature a range of woodland wildflowers as well as tawny owls, stoats and jays.

==Amenities==

Branston has one public house, the Waggon and Horses, a modern building which stands on the High Street close to the historic centre of the village. About farther along the High Street is the Home Guard Club, a private members club. The bar at Branston Hall Hotel is open to visitors and residents. There is a café on the High Street and a supermarket on Station Road. There are four takeaway restaurants. Social activities take place at the Church Hall on Church Hill as well as at the Village Hall on Lincoln Road.

Public recreation grounds can be found on Lincoln Road and Moor Lane. There are tennis courts, a skate park and lawns for bowls. Herons Fitness operate a swimming pool at Branston Community Academy. Pottergate Golf Club is on Moor Lane. There are three hairdressers, beauty salons and a spa. In the village there are social clubs for knitting, gardening and Lego construction. An annual garden show takes place at the Village Hall on Lincoln Road and there is a Christmas Market each winter, located close to the church.

There are two doctors&#x27; surgeries in the village; one on Station Road and the other on Beech Road. Lincoln County Hospital is only five miles away. Creche facilities are available at the Infant School and on the grounds of Branston Community Academy. Also at Branston Community Academy secondary school, there is a medium-sized public library run by volunteers. Branston All Saints&#x27; Church is an Anglican place of worship.

==Education==
Branston C of E Infant School is located on Beech Road, to the northern end of the village. Branston Junior Academy is located on Station Road, close to the Co-op supermarket. Branston&#x27;s secondary school is Branston Community Academy, situated on the outskirts of the village on the road to Heighington; the public library is situated in the school. Further education opportunities include Branston Community Academy Sixth Form and Lincoln College. Due to the concentration of schools in the village, children travel to Branston for school from many nearby villages. The nearest Higher Education institutions are the University of Lincoln and Bishop Grosseteste University (four and five miles away, respectively.)

==Economy==
Most local employment is the nearby city of Lincoln. Branston Potatoes, founded in 1968 employs 600 people nationwide as of 2018. The three schools in the village also provide employment.

A 94 hectare solar park was built between Mere Road and Sleaford Road, to generate electricity for the National Grid. It has been estimated that it will produce enough electricity to power 15,000 homes. Planning permission is temporary, for 35 years, after which time it may be dismantled and returned to agricultural use.

There has been a recent decline in retail businesses in the village, despite population growth. Since 1990 Branston has lost all its newsagents and post offices, as well as its hardware store and greengrocer.

Formerly, the local economy was based around wool production, as evidenced by the remains of the Sheepwash on Rectory Lane and the name of Dye House Farm. Wool and other goods were transported to the River Witham along Branston Causeway. In 2016 the artist James Sutton was commissioned by the Branston Christmas Market Committee and Branston History Group to produce a metal sculpture called &#x27;Lincoln Longwool Sheep Heading for the Sheepwash&#x27;, located on the High Street, to commemorate this past and a local variety of sheep, which has the longest fleece of any breed in the world. Wool production became uneconomical for most of the United Kingdom in the mid-20th century, due to cheap imports, and farmland in Lincolnshire transitioned away from mixed farming, to specialising in arable cropping.

<text>USS &quot;Bream&quot; (SS/SSK/AGSS-243), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the bream. She served during World War II, and her war operations extended from 1 June 1944 to 15 June 1945. During this period she completed six war patrols operating in the Java Sea, Celebes Sea, Sulu Sea, South China Sea, and Gulf of Siam. She sank two Japanese merchant ships totaling 6,934 gross register tons. In addition, &quot;Bream&quot; shared with the submarines and the destruction of a 6,806-gross register ton passenger-cargo ship. On 23 October 1944, while patrolling off western Luzon, &quot;Bream&quot; made a daring surface attack on a Japanese naval force, damaging the heavy cruiser .

After World War II, &quot;Bream&quot; operated in the United States Pacific Fleet during the 1950s and 1960s and saw service in the Vietnam War.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Bream&quot; was laid down on 5 February 1943 by the Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 17 October 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. Wreford G. Chapple, wife of the prospective commanding officer), and commissioned on 24 January 1944, with Commander Wreford &quot;Moon&quot; Chapple in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====January–May 1944====
Following shakedown training in the New London, Connecticut, area, &quot;Bream&quot; set out for the Pacific Ocean on 10 March 1944 and reached the Panama Canal Zone on 20 March 1944. She completed another series of exercises before transiting the Panama Canal on 10 April 1944 and continuing on to Brisbane, Australia, where she arrived on 8 May 1944.

On 10 May 1944, &quot;Bream&quot; left Australia bound for New Guinea. During her voyage, an Allied Liberty ship mistook her for a Japanese submarine and opened gunfire on her at a range of in the Coral Sea at , firing five or six rounds. &quot;Bream&quot; suffered no damage or casualties.

&quot;Bream&quot; reached Milne Bay, New Guinea, on 14 May 1944 and underwent voyage repairs alongside the submarine tender . Upon completion of that work, &quot;Bream&quot; proceeded to Seeadler Harbor on the Admiralty Islands. She reached Seeadler Harbor on 29 May 1944 and began preparations for her first war patrol.

====First war patrol====
On 1 June 1944, &quot;Bream&quot; got underway for her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the vicinity of Halmahera Island. She made several contacts with Japanese vessels in Morotai Strait, but conditions prevented her from taking any offensive action. Her luck changed on 8 June 1944, however, when she spotted a Japanese convoy, selected a transport as a target, and unleashed a six-torpedo spread. Members of &quot;Bream&quot;′s crew heard one loud explosion before she went deep. Several depth charges detonated nearby, but she survived unscathed. Postwar study of Japanese records failed to confirm a kill.

On 13 June 1944, while &quot;Bream&quot; tracked another Japanese convoy, a depth-charge barrage forced her to break off pursuit before she could maneuver into position for an attack. Her luck improved again on 16 June 1944 when she next encountered a Japanese convoy. She fired torpedoes at two transports, and breaking-up noises reverberated throughout the submarine shortly thereafter as the 5,704-gross register ton Japanese cargo ship &quot;Yuki Maru&quot; disintegrated and went to the bottom. Several days after that attack, damage to a hatch gasket in &quot;Bream&quot;′s conning tower while she was submerged allowed water to flood into her pump room and knock out all electrical power in the room. This forced &quot;Bream&quot; to head for Seeadler Harbor, where she arrived on 29 June 1944. Work to correct the damage began shortly thereafter.

====Second war patrol====

Following repairs, refitting, and training, &quot;Bream&quot; began her second war patrol on 21 July 1944, when she got underway for a patrol area in waters off the southern Philippine Islands. On 29 July 1944, she had almost reached the entrance to Davao Gulf when flames broke out in her maneuvering room. Centered over the port main motor, the fire ignited cork and auxiliary cable insulation in the overhead. Fifteen minutes after it broke out, the blaze was extinguished. The damage was not serious enough to force &quot;Bream&quot; to terminate her patrol, and she proceeded to the coast of Mindanao.

On 7 August 1944, &quot;Bream&quot; moved to an area off Davao Gulf in an attempt to intercept traffic coming from the Palau Islands. She encountered Japanese ships but expended no torpedoes. On the morning of 26 August 1944, as she retired toward Fremantle, Australia, &quot;Bream&quot; spotted a Japanese airplane. The plane dropped a bomb which exploded near her as she dived, raised her stern about , and shook her severely. A second bomb also detonated nearby and inflicted considerable damage. Nevertheless, &quot;Bream&quot; put into Brisbane safely on 6 September 1944.

====Third war patrol====
&quot;Bream&quot; underwent a refit by &quot;Euryale&quot; before beginning her third war patrol, getting underway for Darwin, Australia, on 2 October 1944. She paused at Darwin on 9 October for minor repairs and refueling before continuing on to her patrol area off the Philippine Islands between the northern end of Palawan Passage and Manila. On 16 October 1944, she sighted a two-masted barge with an escort but decided to let them pass to avoid alerting more valuable targets of her presence.

On 23 October 1944, three large ships — two Imperial Japanese Navy light cruisers and one heavy cruiser — appeared on &quot;Bream&quot;’s radar scope. One of the Japanese warships approached to within on &quot;Bream&quot;′s port quarter before &quot;Bream&quot; fired six torpedoes. Soon thereafter, &quot;Bream&quot;’s crew heard three loud explosions and believed that they had sunk a Japanese cruiser. A study of Japanese records after the war revealed that &quot;Bream&quot; had damaged the Japanese heavy cruiser severely enough to keep her from participating in the Battle of Leyte Gulf of &quot;Bream&quot; endured intermittent depth charging over the next five hours, but suffered no damage.

On 24 October 1944, &quot;Bream&quot; picked up six survivors of a Japanese ship sunk several days before by the submarine . On 25 October, she moved into position for an attempt to intercept the Japanese fleet retiring from Philippine waters after Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. On 30 October 1944, she spotted a Japanese convoy, fired a six-torpedo spread at a large transport, and went deep to avoid depth charges. Her torpedoes damaged the transport, but it was able to continue under its own power.

On 4 November 1944, &quot;Bream&quot; fired four torpedoes at another Japanese transport, but all missed. After weathering a total of eight depth charges, she eluded her pursuers and resumed her patrol. On 6 November, she came upon two Japanese cruisers and began closing for an attack on the leading ship. After careful maneuvering to avoid the cruiser’s escorts, she fired four torpedoes. Some &quot;Bream&quot; crewmen reported three explosions, but no damage to any Japanese ship seems to have resulted. &quot;Bream&quot; then shaped a course for Fremantle, where she arrived on 22 November 1944.

====Fourth war patrol====

Following refit and training, &quot;Bream&quot; commenced her fourth war patrol on 19 December 1944. She entered Exmouth Gulf on the coast of Western Australia on 22 December 1944 and refueled there that same day. She continued on through Lombok Strait northbound, entered the Java Sea, spotted a sailboat on 31 December, and decided to attack it with her gun. During the action, a Japanese plane approached, forcing &quot;Bream&quot; to cease fire and dive.

On 9 January 1945, &quot;Bream&quot; began patrolling the western approaches to Balabac Strait. After four uneventful days, she moved to the northern end of the strait but again made no contacts and so shifted to Miri on the coast of Borneo for reconnaissance work. She sighted a large Japanese vessel on 24 January, but the contact proved to be a hospital ship. &quot;Bream&quot; transited Lombok Strait southbound on 4 February 1945, paused at Onslow, Australia, for refueling on 6 February, and finally arrived at Fremantle on 10 February 1945.

====Fifth war patrol====

Bream left Australia on 7 March 1945 for her fifth war patrol, made a refueling stop at Exmouth Gulf on 10 March, and proceeded through Lombok Strait northbound to the shipping lanes between Balikpapan on Borneo and-Surabaya on Java. On 13 March 1945, she intercepted two Japanese &quot;sea trucks&quot; — the U.S. term for small cargo ships — and sank them with her gun. On 14 March, she came across a Japanese convoy of three small cargo ships and an escort. She fired three bow tubes at the leading cargo ship, but all of them broached. She then got off one more torpedo, and it seemed to hit the ship, which blew up with a tremendous explosion. However, postwar accounting failed to confirm a kill.

On 15 March 1945, &quot;Bream&quot; sighted a Japanese escort destroyer and began preparing for an attack. However, the destroyer detected &quot;Bream&quot; and began depth-charging her. Several depth charges went off close aboard and drove &quot;Bream&quot; to the bottom in of water. &quot;Bream&quot; remained on the ocean floor, mired in mud, for five hours and underwent repeated depth-charge barrages. During one attack, her conning tower hatch was lifted, forcing her crew to abandon the conning tower and secure it by closing the lower hatch. When the destroyer gave up the chase later that night, &quot;Bream&quot; surfaced and began evaluating the extent of her damage. The damage proved extensive, and she spent several days making temporary repairs.

&quot;Bream&quot; later detected two ships on radar that proved to be Japanese cargo ships. She fired four torpedoes from her bow tubes, but all four promptly sank. Apparently the tubes had been damaged in the encounter with the Japanese escort destroyer. &quot;Bream&quot; then set a course through Lombok Strait for Australia and reached Fremantle on 22 March 1945. she underwent a refit, during which both of her periscopes, her starboard propeller shaft, and both of her screws were replaced, and the damage to her torpedo tubes was corrected.

====Sixth war patrol====

On 20 April 1945, &quot;Bream&quot; commenced her sixth war patrol. She transited Lombok Strait northbound on 25 April 1945 and early on the morning of 26 April spotted what appeared to be an American submarine. The submarine quickly turned and headed toward &quot;Bream&quot;, which dived and manned her battle stations. Several depth charges dropped by a Japanese escort vessel shook &quot;Bream&quot;, but she managed to clear the area safely. A few hours later, she encountered two small Japanese patrol boats, but they were too small to merit a torpedo attack.

On 29 April 1945, while patrolling off southern Borneo, &quot;Bream&quot; picked up the trail of a Japanese oiler. After stalking the oiler for several hours, she fired four torpedoes at it. The first torpedo hit, and the oiler disintegrated in a mass of flames. &quot;Bream&quot; continued her patrol uneventfully until pulling into port at Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines on 14 May 1945 for voyage repairs and fuel. On 16 May, she put back out to sea and headed for lifeguard duty off the southern tip of Formosa. During her time on station, she rescued five downed American aviators. On 31 May 1945, she headed for Saipan in the Mariana Islands, where she arrived on 5 June 1945.

====End of war====

&quot;Bream&quot; departed Saipan on 6 June 1945 and, following a two-day stop at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arrived at San Francisco, California, on 24 June 1945. Upon her arrival, she began an overhaul at the Bethlehem Steel Company shipyard in San Francisco. While the work was in progress, the war in the Pacific ended on 15 August 1945 (14 August on the other side of the International Date Line in San Francisco). &quot;Bream&quot; later transferred to the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California. She was decommissioned there on 31 January 1946 and was laid up in the Pacific Reserve Fleet.

===1950s===

As a part of the Navy’s fleet expansion program in response to the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, &quot;Bream&quot; was recommissioned on 5 June 1951 and reported to Submarine Squadron 3, United States Pacific Fleet. From June 1951 to August 1952 she engaged in the training of submarine crews and services to the Fleet Sonar School at San Diego, California.

On 10 September 1952, &quot;Bream&quot; was decommissioned to undergo conversion to an antisubmarine &quot;hunter-killer submarine&quot; at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco. The conversion included the installation of a snorkel — which enabled her to take in air and operate her diesel engines while submerged — streamlining of her conning tower, improving the habitability of the crew’s living spaces, and the installation of special sonar listening equipment. She was redesignated SSK-243 on 18 February 1953. She was recommissioned on 20 June 1953.

&quot;Bream&quot; resumed operations with the Fleet Sonar School at San Diego. She also took part in numerous Pacific Fleet operations and exercises and conducted submarine crew training. She commenced a cold-weather training cruise to Alaska in September 1954 and made a stop at Pearl Harbor before returning to San Diego on 15 November 1954. She continued local operations along the coast of California until May 1955, when she made another voyage to Pearl Harbor. During her stay in Hawaii from 7 to 24 May 1955, she participated in an extensive antisubmarine warfare operation. She returned to San Diego late in May 1955 and resumed normal operations until late September 1955. On 22 September 1955, she entered Hunters Poit Naval Shipyard for an overhaul.

In February 1956, &quot;Bream&quot;′s home port changed to Pearl Harbor and she was assigned to Submarine Squadron 7, Submarine Division 72. She left Pearl Harbor on 6 March 1956 for an extended cruise in the western Pacific. She reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 11 June 1956 and operated in that area during the next two months. In early August 1956, he made a short cruise to Chinhae, South Korea, and returned to Yokosuka via Yokohama, Japan. In early October 1956 he made a return visit to Chinhae and a call at Hong Kong for shore leave during the first week of November 1956. She began the voyage back to Hawaii on 2 December 1956 and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 9 December.

From January to May 1957, &quot;Bream&quot; carried out local operations in the Hawaiian Islands from her base at Pearl Harbor. She commenced a trip to San Francisco 4 June 1957, arriving there on 13 June. After a week’s visit, Bream returned to Hawaii and remained at Pearl Harbor until mid-July 1957, when she began a cruise to Alaska from which she did not return until early September 1957. She departed Pearl Harbor on 31 October 1957 bound for the Far East. Following port calls at Pago Pago in American Samoa and Auckland, New Zealand, she reached Yokohama on 25 December 1957 She departed Yokohama on 7 January 1958 bound for Subic Bay on Luzon in the Philippines. Among her later ports of call were Yokosuka, Japan, and Hong Kong. After three more months of providing services in support of United States Seventh Fleet ships, &quot;Bream&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor early in April 1958.

Shortly after her arrival, &quot;Bream&quot; began an overhaul at the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Her overhaul was completed on 13 September 1958, and she resumed local operations in Hawaiian waters. She sailed for East Asia on 6 April 1959, reached Yokosuka on 18 April, and remained there until 28 April. She then proceeded to the Philippines for operations in Manila Bay, after which she visited Hong Kong and Buckner Bay on Okinawa. On 2 June 1959, she returned to Yokosuka, which became her base of operations for the remainder of June. In July 1959, she got underway for special operations. While carrying out that assignment, she reverted to the hull number SS-243 in August 1959. She stopped briefly at Yokosuka again before departing Japanese waters on 21 September 1959 on her way to Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 October 1959.

===1960s===
&quot;Bream&quot; carried out local operations in Hawaiian waters until 26 November 1960, when she again departed for Japan. After a stop at Chichi Jima in the Bonin Islands on 9 December 1960, she arrived at Yokosuka on the 11 December. Among her ports of call during this deployment were Atami, Japan; Buckner Bay; Hong Kong; Manila and Subic Bay, Philippines; and Guam in the Mariana Islands. The cruise ended on 24 May 1961 when &quot;Bream&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor. She participated in local operations in HAwaii until 1 September 1961, when she entered the Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard for an overhaul.

&quot;Bream&quot; left the shipyard on 28 January 1962 and got underway for San Francisco on 1 February. She arrived at San Francisco on 10 February 1962 and moved to Long Beach. California, a few days later. She left California on 19 February 1962 and returned to Pearl Harbor. During the next few months, she alternated between local training in Hawaiian waters and upkeep at Pearl Harbor. She began another cruise to the western Pacific on 8 August 1962 and visited Yokosuka, Japan, and Chinhae, South Korea, in the fall and early winter of 1962. She also provided services to Task Group 70.4, a Pacific Fleet anrisubmarine &quot;hunter/killer&quot; group. She also took part in Exercise Pilot Light before pulling into port at Yokosuka for the Christmas holidays in December 1962.

&quot;Bream&quot; departed Yokosuka on 1 January 1963 en route to Okinawa. After briefly pausing there, she moved on to Hong Kong. She also visited Guam before arriving at Pearl Harbor on 2 February 1963. She then participated in local operations until 27 August 1963, when she began a special operation. That mission terminated at Adak in the Aleutian Islands on 18 October 1963. She departed Alaskan waters on 20 October and visited Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, before calling at Seattle, Washington. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 13 November 1963 and spent the rest of 1963 in local operations.

On 1 February 1964, &quot;Bream&quot; was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine and redesignated AGSS-243. She continued to operate from Pearl Harbor through May 1964. On 1 June 1964, she got underway for her new home port, San Diego, and arrived there on the 11 June 1964. She was assigned to Submarine Squadron 3 and operated in the San Diego area for approximately two months. On 31 August 1964 she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for an overhaul which was completed on 26 January 1965.

After her overhaul, &quot;Bream&quot; began a training cruise which included stops at Port Angeles, Bangor, and Bremerton, Washington. She returned to Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 27 February 1965 for the installation of a new battery and a diesel engine overhaul before finally returning to San Diego on 11 July 1965 and resuming local operations.

&quot;Bream&quot; departed California on 12 November 1965 for Vietnam War operations in the western Pacific with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Upon her arrival in waters off Vietnam, she assumed duty on Yankee Station. She was relieved on 6 January 1966 and headed for Thailand. She visited Sattahip and Bangkok and held joint operations with the Royal Thai Navy. On 20 January 1966, she headed for Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and arrived there pn 26 January. She operated from Kaohsiung until 16 February 1966, when she sailed for Yokosuka, where she conducted local operations until 15 March 1966. She then departed Japan for the Philippines. After a voyage during which she provided services to aircraft, she finally reached Naval Station Sangley Point in the Philippines on 29 March 1966. She later made a brief call at Hong Kong for shore leave before returning to Yokosuka on 16 April 1966.

&quot;Bream&quot; left Japan on 24 April 1966 and headed back to the United States. After a short stop at Pearl Harbor in early May 1966, she arrived in San Diego on the 15 May. Following a leave and upkeep period, shcarried out local operations from San Diego until midsummer 1966, when she made a brief visit to the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard in San Francisco for installation of communications equipment. She returned to San Diego on 6 August 1966 to resume local operations, which continued until the Christmas holidays in December 1966.

During January and February 1967, &quot;Bream&quot; participated in operations along the coast of Southern California. On 3 March 1967, she embarked on an extended training cruise which included a port visit at Acapulco, Mexico. She returned to San Diego on 25 March 1967 and commenced preparations to deploy to the western Pacific. In April 1967, she entered the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard for drydocking and repairs. She then returned to San Diego to complete her preparations. On 9 June 1967, she got underway for the Far East. During this cruise, she visited Hong Kong; Songkhla and Bangkok, Thailand; Subic Bay and Cebu City in the Philippines; Keelung and Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Chinhae, South Korea; and Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan.

<text>So Much Shouting, So Much Laughter is the second live album by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, released in 2002 (see 2002 in music).

The opening track of the second disc, &quot;Comes a Time&quot;, is an excerpt from the famous speech by Mario Savio, given before Free Speech Movement demonstrators entered Sproul Hall to begin their sit-in on December 3, 1964. His climactic words about &quot;the operation of the machine&quot; have been quoted widely ever since, out of context, as the existential emblem of the FSM.

<doc id="1078966" wikidata="Q1674937" url="?curid=1078966" title="Isuzu Axiom">
<text>The Isuzu Axiom is a mid-size SUV introduced by Isuzu in 2001 for the 2002 model year. The Axiom is derived from the Isuzu Rodeo and was intended to be Isuzu&#x27;s response to the popularity of car-based SUVs, such as the Toyota Highlander, replacing the Trooper as Isuzu&#x27;s flagship vehicle in the United States.

Exclusively sold in the United States and Costa Rica, the Axiom was built alongside the Rodeo in Lafayette, Indiana, at Subaru Isuzu Automotive, Inc. The peculiar styling and truck-based platform was poorly received in the marketplace. The Axiom was discontinued and replaced by the Chevrolet TrailBlazer-derived Isuzu Ascender in 2004, leading to Isuzu&#x27;s withdrawal from manufacturing and selling passenger vehicles in North America in 2009.

The Axiom had two trim levels: the base and the up-level XS. The XS trim had features like fog lamps, a sunroof, heated front seats, an auto-dimming mirror with Homelink, 12-speaker premium audio, and leather upholstery. The name &quot;Axiom&quot; was determined by a naming contest held by Isuzu and won by Dr. Hakan Urey from Redmond, Washington, who suggested the name and won his own Axiom in 2001. The word means an established, accepted, or self-evidently true statement or proposition.

The Axiom is available with a Torque-On-Demand four-wheel drive system, a direct-injection 6VE1-DI V6 engine and an Aisin Warner AW30-40LS automatic transmission was added in 2004, boosting power from 230 to 250 hp (172 to 186 kW). A new chrome bar grille and liftgate chrome that stretched tail light to tail light was also added.

The Axiom was discontinued in July 2004, and the Lafayette plant was retooled to build the Subaru B9 Tribeca. With the retirement of the Rodeo and Axiom, Isuzu, which once sold a complete line of cars, trucks and SUVs, no longer offered any Japanese-built consumer vehicles in the United States (from 2006–2009, the lineup consisted only of rebadged General Motors vehicles).

In 2013, a recall was issued for the Isuzu Axiom for frames with severe rust issues, NHTSA Campaign Number 13V547000. Similar related vehicles, 1998–2002 Isuzu Rodeo and Honda Passport NHTSA Recall Campaign Number 10V436000, and Isuzu Amigo in 2012, Campaign Number 12V306000.

The Axiom is a slightly diluted production version of the 1999 Isuzu ZXS concept that debuted at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show. Isuzu also built 3 Axiom concepts: the 2001 Axiom XSF, 2002 Axiom XSR, and 2003 Axiom XST.

Chinese manufacturer Great Wall later copied the design of the Axiom for their Haval H3/Hover SUV, albeit with a minor restyling of the body.

The 2001 movie &quot;Spy Kids&quot; and its 2002 sequel featured an Isuzu Axiom as part of a promotion, even having a lenticular poster and an RC car made by RadioShack.

<doc id="1078969" wikidata="Q973254" url="?curid=1078969" title="Iban people">
<text>The Iban are an indigenous ethnic group native to Borneo, primarily found in the Malaysian state of Sarawak, Brunei and parts of West Kalimantan, Indonesia. They are one of the largest groups among the broader Dayak peoples, a term historically used to describe the indigenous communities of Borneo. The Iban are best known for their rich cultural traditions, which include distinctive practices in agriculture, music, weaving and social organisation.

Historically, the Iban were known for their warrior culture, particularly the practice of headhunting, which was a central element of their societal structure and spiritual beliefs until the early 20th century. The Iban’s traditional social units are based around longhouses, which serve as communal living spaces for extended families. In terms of agriculture, the Iban have long practiced shifting cultivation, particularly of rice, as well as hunting and gathering.

The Iban trace their origins to the Kapuas basin in Kalimantan Barat, specifically the Ketungau tributary which is considered their ancestral land prior to their migration into the territory of modern-day Sarawak from the middle of the 16th century. Their migration was influenced by factors such as tribal conflict, territorial expansion and the search for fertile land. Central to their cultural and spiritual identity is Tembawai Tampun Juah, located in the Segumon region of Sanggau, West Kalimantan, which is considered the symbolic birthplace of the Iban people.

Under the colonial administration of the Brooke family in the 19th century, the Iban played an important role in military campaigns, where they were recruited as soldiers and contributed to the defense of Sarawak and later, Malaysia. Over time, their migratory culture extended beyond Borneo, leading to the establishment of visible diaspora communities in Peninsula Malaysia.

In the contemporary context, the Iban remain a prominent ethnic group in Sarawak, constituting 28.8% of the total population. Despite the influences of modernisation, they have preserved a strong cultural identity. The Iban continue to uphold traditional practices, including their language, Pua Kumbu weaving and ceremonial music, while also participating actively in the region’s contemporary social and economic spheres.

==Etymology==
Before the establishment of the Raj of Sarawak in 1841, the term &quot;Iban&quot; was an exonym used by neighboring ethnic groups to describe the people who would later identify as Iban. At that time, the Iban did not commonly use the term &quot;Iban&quot; for themselves. Instead, they identified by the rivers they inhabited, such as &quot;Kami Saribas&quot; (We of the Saribas River), &quot;Kami Skrang&quot; (We of the Skrang River) or &quot;Kami Sebuyau&quot; (We of the Sebuyau River). In addition to river-based identifiers, the Iban also used names based on geographical areas, for instance, identifying themselves as the people of a particular locality. These identifiers were used to signify their regional and social affiliations, often reflecting their local settlements or areas of influence.

The term &quot;Iban&quot; is commonly believed to have originated as a corruption of the Kayan word &quot;hivan&quot;, meaning &quot;wanderer.&quot; The Kayan people, who lived in the upper reaches of the Rejang River, used the term disparagingly to refer to the Iban pioneers, whose restless nature and migration patterns made them unwelcome neighbors. This term remained largely confined to the Rejang area and was not known to other Dayak groups until the mid-1800s.

Prior to the 19th century, non-Malay indigenous groups in Borneo were often grouped together under the term &quot;Dyaks&quot; or &quot;Dayaks&quot; by outsiders, including Westerners and the Brooke administration. The term was used to describe various indigenous groups, though it was not specific to any one ethnic group. James Brooke, the first Rajah of Sarawak, coined the term &quot;Sea Dayak&quot; to distinguish the Iban from the &quot;Land Dayaks&quot; (such as the Bidayuh). This distinction reflected the Iban&#x27;s more mobile, riverine lifestyle in contrast to the more settled, agricultural lifestyle of other Dayak groups.

The name &quot;Iban&quot; became more widely accepted by the group over time, particularly after World War II. Despite its origins as an outsider&#x27;s term, the word &quot;Iban&quot; has been embraced by the people themselves and is now the commonly used term to refer to the group, especially in Sarawak.

==History==
===Pre-19th Century: Early Origin and Cultural Development===

The Iban people have a rich indigenous historical tradition, passed down primarily through oral literature, written records on &quot;Papan Turai&quot; (wooden plaques) and cultural practices. These sources preserve important details about the Iban’s historical migration and settlement.

A central aspect of Iban identity is their deep connection to their ancestral homeland, reflected in both their spiritual beliefs and historical narratives. One key site in this regard is &quot;Tembawai Tampun Juah&quot;, located in the Segumon region of Sanggau, West Kalimantan, Indonesia. According to Iban oral traditions, &quot;Tembawai Tampun Juah&quot; is considered the first settlement of the Iban people, symbolising their journey after being separated from their ancestral figures. This site remains culturally and historically significant, embodying the Iban’s connection to their land and heritage.
In addition to the spiritual significance of &quot;Tembawai Tampun Juah&quot;, the Iban trace their geographical origins to the Kapuas region in West Kalimantan, specifically the Ketungau tributary, which is traditionally regarded as the birthplace of early Iban leaders and communities. From the middle of the sixteenth century, the Iban began migrating to Sarawak due to tribal conflicts and the search for fertile land. Key locations along their migration included Melanjan in the Kapuas Valley, Pangkalan Tubau near the Kalimantan-Sarawak border, and Lubok Antu, their first major settlement in Sarawak. While Tembawai Tampun Juah represents their mythic origins, the Kapuas River region is considered the historical starting point of their migration. Key locations along their migration route include Melanjan in the Kapuas Valley, Pangkalan Tubau near the Kalimantan-Sarawak border and Lubok Antu, their first major settlement in Sarawak. The migration narrative highlights influential figures such as Lau Moa, a migration leader and ancestral chiefs like Ambau, Mawar Biak and Mawar Tuai, who are said to have guided the Iban to their new territories. This migration story is preserved in the Papan Turai and Iban oral traditions, which continue to hold a central place in Iban cultural identity.

A pivotal figure in the Iban migration narrative is Sengalang Burung, who holds an important place in Iban oral traditions. According to these traditions, Sengalang Burung and his followers initially settled along the Kapuas River in southwestern Borneo. His grandson, Sera Gunting, later led the Iban further westward into the Tiang Laju Range, now part of Sarawak. It is said that at Merakai, a tributary of the Kapuas River, Sengalang Burung convened a council with his followers to plan their migration to Batang Ai, a region that would become a major center of Iban settlement.

The historical timeline of the Iban migration has been further supported by the work of Benedict Sandin (1968), who suggested that the Iban began their migration from the Kapuas Hulu region in the 1550s. The first group of settlers moved into the Batang Lupar area, establishing a community near the Undop River. Over the course of five generations, the Iban expanded their settlements further west, east and north, founding new communities along the Batang Lupar, Batang Sadong, Saribas, and Batang Layar rivers.

Modern linguistic studies, such as those conducted by Asmah Haji Omar (1981), Rahim Aman (1997), Chong Shin and James T. Collins (2019), as well as material culture research by M. Heppell (2020), also support the claim that the Iban language and culture have their roots in the upper Kapuas region. These studies trace the development of the Iban people to this area, reinforcing the historical narratives preserved in oral and written forms.

===19th Century: Migration, Colonialism and Socio-Political Changes===

The 19th century marked a crucial period in Iban history, particularly with the arrival of the Brooke family and the establishment of the Raj of Sarawak. This era significantly impacted Iban society, influencing their social, economic and political structures. The period also witnessed large-scale migration that helped consolidate the Iban as one of the dominant ethnic groups in Sarawak today. The expansion of the Iban was not merely a physical relocation, but also a cultural and demographic shift, with their customs, language and traditions spreading throughout the western Borneo region.

During this period, the Iban encountered various hunting and gathering societies, as well as some agricultural communities. The presence of the Iban often resulted in the assimilation or displacement of these groups. While some of the original inhabitants were incorporated into Iban society, others were either destroyed or forced to leave their traditional territories.

By the early 1800s, the Iban began migrating into the Rejang River basin, which is now divided into Sarawak&#x27;s Third, Sixth, and Seventh Divisions. These early migrants primarily came from the northern tributaries of the Batang Lupar and Saribas rivers, moving southward into the Rejang&#x27;s southern tributaries. Others, from the upper Batang Lupar (such as Batang Ai), traveled through the Leboyan and Kanyau (Embaloh) rivers, eventually reaching the Katibas River, a tributary of the Rejang in central Sarawak.

The Brooke administration played a key role in facilitating Iban migration during Sarawak’s territorial expansion, which helped establish the Iban as a dominant ethnic group in the region. James Brooke, a British adventurer, arrived in Borneo in 1838 at the request of the Sultan of Brunei to suppress a rebellion. After his success, he was appointed Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, where he focused on controlling piracy and regulating indigenous practices like headhunting, which were common among the Dayak groups, including the Iban.
Brooke’s most significant opposition came from Rentap, a prominent Dayak leader. Brooke led three military expeditions against Rentap, culminating in Rentap’s defeat at the Battle of Sadok Hill. Throughout these campaigns, Brooke relied heavily on local Dayak soldiers, famously stating, &quot;Only Dayaks can kill Dayaks,&quot; underscoring both his dependence on local fighters and the complex dynamics of colonial military alliances. In 1851, Brooke faced accusations of excessive force against the Dayak people, allegedly under the pretext of anti-piracy operations. This led to a Commission of Inquiry in 1854, which cleared him of any wrongdoing. Despite the controversy, Brooke continued to employ Dayak soldiers in various military campaigns, against the Chinese-led uprising of Liu Shan Bang and local Malay resistance movements led by Syarif Masahor.
By 1870, large populations of Iban were reported to have established settlements along the Oya and Mukah Rivers. In the early 20th century, Iban migration extended further to regions such as Tatau, Bintulu (formerly Kemena), Balingian and the northern parts of Sarawak, including the Limbang River and Baram Valley.

As Iban populations grew, local resources came under strain, particularly in areas practicing traditional swidden agriculture. To manage this, the Brooke administration imposed migration restrictions to prevent overpopulation and resource depletion, leading to tensions in regions like the Balleh Valley. However, the government also encouraged Iban settlement in newly annexed territories, recognizing their expertise in resource management, including the exploitation of rattan, camphor, damar and wild rubber. Government-supported migration was encouraged in regions such as Limbang (annexed in 1890) and Baram.

By the late 1800s, as areas like Batang Lupar, Skrang Valley, and Batang Ai became overcrowded, the Brooke government facilitated Iban migration to less populated areas. Iban from regions like Simanggang, Batang Lupar, and the Second Division were encouraged to settle in places like Bintulu, Baram, Lundu, and Limbang. 

This migration played a crucial role in spreading Iban language, culture, and agricultural practices throughout Sarawak. However, it also led to social and political changes, such as the assimilation of the Bukitan people in Batang Lupar and the Lugat people through intermarriage. In other areas, including those inhabited by the Ukits, Seru, Miriek and Biliun, Iban migration led to violent conflicts and the near-total annihilation of these indigenous populations.

===20th Century: Participation in World War II and the Malayan Emergency===

In the 20th century, significant Iban migrations continued, with key movements including the settlement of the Baleh tributary of the Rejang River in 1922, the establishment of Iban communities in the Suai, Niah and Sibuti regions in 1927, and a government-supported relocation to Lundu in 1955. Additional migrations occurred in line with government development schemes in the Second and Fourth Divisions of Sarawak. The first Iban migrants arrived in Merotai, Tawau, Sabah around 1920, and the Iban population there grew significantly from the 1960s onward.

The outbreak of Second World War had a significant impact on the Iban and other indigenous groups in Borneo. Following the Japanese invasion, indigenous populations, including the Iban and Malay, faced severe mistreatment and massacres, particularly in the Kapit Division. In response, a force of Dayak fighters, including Iban, was formed to assist the Allied. Trained by a small team of US airmen and Australian special operatives, the Dayak force successfully killed or captured approximately 1,500 Japanese soldiers. They also provided critical intelligence about Japanese-held oil fields.

In the post-war period, during the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960), the British Army enlisted Iban personnel to assist in counterinsurgency operations against the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA). These individuals, often with extensive local knowledge and experience as trackers, were attached to British patrols to help navigate the difficult terrain. The involvement of the Iban in these operations became controversial when, in 1952, photographs were published by &quot;The Daily Worker&quot; (a British communist newspaper) showing Iban personnel and British soldiers posing with severed heads of suspected insurgents. Initially, the British government denied any official sanction for such practices. However, Colonial Secretary Oliver Lyttleton later confirmed that Iban troops had been authorized to engage in these actions as part of their military role. The incident led to the British Malayan headhunting scandal, which attracted widespread criticism. After the conclusion of the conflict, all Dayak troops, including the Iban, were disbanded.

==Ibanic regional groups==

Although Ibans generally speak various dialects which are mutually intelligible, they can be divided into different branches which are named after the geographical areas where they reside.

==Language==
The Iban language (&quot;jaku Iban&quot;) is spoken by the Iban, a branch of the Dayak ethnic group formerly known as &quot;Sea Dayak&quot;. The language belongs to Malayic languages, which is a Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family. It is thought that the homeland of the Malayic languages is in western Borneo, where the Ibanic languages remain. The Malayic branch represents a secondary dispersal, probably from central Sumatra but possibly also from Borneo.

==Religion==
For hundreds of years, the Iban&#x27;s ancestors practiced their own traditional custom and pagan religious system. European Christian colonial invaders, after the arrival of James Brooke, led to the influence of European missionaries and conversions to Christianity. Although the majority are now Christian; many continue to observe both Christian and traditional pagan ceremonies, particularly during marriages or festivals, although some ancestral practices such as &#x27;Miring&#x27; are still prohibited by certain churches. After being Christianized, the majority of Iban people have changed their traditional name to a Hebrew-based &quot;Christian name&quot; followed by the Ibanese name such as David Dunggau, Joseph Jelenggai, Mary Mayang, etc.

For the majority of Ibans who are Christians, some Christian festivals such as Christmas, Good Friday, Easter are also celebrated. Some Ibans are devout Christians and follow the Christian faith strictly. Since conversion to Christianity, some Iban people celebrate their ancestors&#x27; pagan festivals using Christian ways and the majority still observe Gawai Dayak (the Dayak Festival), which is a generic celebration in nature unless a proper is held and thereby preserves their ancestors&#x27; culture and tradition.

In Brunei, 1,503 Ibans have converted to Islam from 2009 to 2019 according to official statistics. Many Bruneian Ibans intermarry with Malays and convert to Islam as a result. Nevertheless, most Iban in Brunei are devout Christians similar to the Iban in Malaysia. Bruneian Ibans also often intermarry with the Murut or Christian Chinese due to their shared faith.

Despite the difference in faiths, Ibans of different faiths do live and help each other regardless of faith but some do split their longhouses due to different faiths or even political affiliations. The Ibans believe in helping and having fun together. Some elder Ibans are worried that among most of the younger Iban generation, their culture has faded since the conversion to Christianity and the adoption of a more modern life style. Nevertheless, most Iban embrace modern progress and development.

Many Christian Dayaks have adopted European names, but some continue to maintain their ancestors&#x27; traditional names. Since the conversion of most Iban people to Christianity, some have generally abandoned their ancestors&#x27; beliefs such as &#x27;Miring&#x27; or the celebration of &#x27;Gawai Antu&#x27;, and many celebrate only Christianized traditional festivals.

Numerous local people and certain missionaries have sought to document and preserve traditional Dayak religious practices. For example, Reverend William Howell contributed numerous articles on the Iban language, lore, and culture between 1909 and 1910 to the &quot;Sarawak Gazette&quot;. The articles were later compiled in a book in 1963 entitled, &quot;The Sea Dayaks and Other Races of Sarawak&quot;.

==Culture and customs==
===Music===

Iban music is percussion-oriented. The Iban have a musical heritage consisting of various types of agung ensembles – percussion ensembles composed of large hanging, suspended or held, bossed/knobbed gongs which act as drums without any accompanying melodic instrument. The typical Iban agung ensemble will include a set of (small gongs arranged together side by side and played like a xylophone), a (the so-called &quot;bass gong&quot;), a (which acts as a snare) and also a or (a single sided drum/percussion instrument).

One example of Iban traditional music is the &quot;taboh&quot;.
There are various kinds of (music), depending the purpose and types of , like (slow tempo). The can be played in some distinctive types corresponding to the purpose and type of each ceremony. The most popular ones are called (swinging blow) and (sweeping blow).

===Handicrafts===

Woven products are known as . Several types of woven blankets made by the Ibans are and . Using weaving, the Iban make blankets, bird shirts (), and . Weaving is the women&#x27;s warpath while (headhunting) is the men&#x27;s warpath. The blanket do have conventional or ritual motives depending on the purpose of the woven item. Those who finish the weaving lessons are called (finish the wood). Among well-known ritual motifs are Gajah Meram (Brooding Elephant), Tiang Sandong (Ritual Pole), Meligai (Shrine) and Tiang Ranyai.

===Land ownership===
Traditionally, Iban agriculture was based on actual integrated indigenous farming system. Iban Dayaks tend to plant paddy on hill slopes. Agricultural Land in this sense was used and defined primarily in terms of hill rice farming, ladang (garden), and hutan (forest). According to Prof Derek Freeman in his Report on Iban Agriculture, Iban Dayaks used to practice twenty-seven stages of hill rice farming once a year and their shifting cultivation practices allow the forest to regenerate itself rather than to damage the forest, thereby to ensure the continuity and sustainability of forest use and/or survival of the Iban community itself. The Iban Dayaks love virgin forests for their dependency on forests but that is for migration, territorial expansion, and/or fleeing enemies.
Once the Iban migrated into a riverine area, they will divide the area into three basic areas i.e. farming area, territorial domain (pemakai menoa) and forest reserve (pulau galau). The farming area is distributed accordingly to each family based on consensus. The chief and elders are responsible to settle any disputes and claims amicably. The territorial domain is a common area where the families of each longhouse are allowed to source for foods and confined themselves without encroachment into domains of other longhouses. The forest reserve is for common use, as a source of natural materials for building longhouse (ramu), boat making, plaiting, etc.

The whole riverine region can consist of many longhouses and thus the entire region belongs to all of them and they shall defend it against encroachment and attack by outsiders. Those longhouses sharing and living in the same riverine region call themselves shared owners (sepemakai).

Each track of virgin forest cleared by each family (rimba) will automatically belong to that family and inherited by its descendants as heirloom (pesaka) unless they migrate to other regions and relinquish their ownership of their land, which is symbolized by a token payment using a simple item in exchange for the land.

===Agriculture and economy===

Traditionally, Iban agriculture was based on actual integrated indigenous farming system. Ibans plant hill rice paddies once a year in twenty-seven stages as described by Freeman in his report on Iban Agriculture. Agricultural Land in this sense was used and defined primarily in terms of hill rice farming, ladang (garden), and hutan (forest). The main stages of the paddy cultivation is followed by the Iban lemambang bards to compose their ritual incantations. The bards also analogizes the headhunting expedition with the paddy cultivation stages. Other crops planted include , cucumber (), , corn, , millet and cotton (tayak). Downriver Iban plant wet rice paddy at the low-lying riverine areas which are beyond the reach of the salt water tide.

For cash, the Ibans find jungle produce to sell at the market or town. Later, they planted rubber, pepper and cocoa. Nowadays, many Ibans work in towns to seek better sources of income.

Trading is not a natural activity for the Iban. They did trade paddy for jars or salted fish coming from the sea in the old days but paddy lost its economic value a long time ago. Not much yield can be produced from repetitively replanted areas anyway because their planting relies on the natural source of fertilizer from the forest itself and the source of water for irrigation is from the rain, hence the cycle of the weather season is important and need to be correctly followed. Trading of sundries, jungle produce or agricultural produce is normally performed by the Chinese who commuted between the town and the location of the shop.

=== Piracy ===

The Sea Dayaks, as their name implies, are a maritime set of tribes, and fight chiefly in canoes and boats. One of their favorite tactics is to conceal some of their larger boats, and then to send some small and badly manned canoes forward to attack the enemy to lure them. The canoes then retreat, followed by the enemy, and as soon as they pass the spot where the larger boats are hidden, they are attacked by them in the rear, while the smaller canoes, which have acted as decoys, turn and join in the fight. The rivers bends are chosen for this kind of attack, the overhanging branches of trees and the dense foliage of the bank affording excellent hiding places for the boats.

Many of the sea dayaks were also pirates. In the 19th century there was a great deal of piracy, and it was secretly encouraged by the native rulers, who obtained a share of the spoil, and also by the Malays who knew well how to handle a boat. The Malay fleet consisted of a large number of long war boats or &quot;prahu&quot;, each about 90 feet (27 m) long or more, and carrying a brass gun in the bow, the pirates being armed with swords, spears and muskets. Each boat was paddled by from 60 to 80 men. These boats skulked about in the sheltered coves waiting for their prey, and attacked merchant vessels making the passage between China and Singapore. The Malay pirates and their Dayak allies would wreck and destroy every trading vessel they came across, murder most of the crew who offered any resistance, and the rest were made as slaves. The Dayak would cut off the heads of those who were slain, smoke them over the fire to dry them, and then take them home to treasure as valued possessions.

===Military history===

A Dayak war party in proas and canoes fought a battle with Murray Maxwell following the wreck of HMS Alceste in 1817 at the Gaspar Strait.

The Iban Dayak&#x27;s first direct encounter with the Brooke and his men was in 1843, during the attack by Brooke&#x27;s forces on the Batang Saribas region i.e. Padeh, Paku, and Rimbas respectively. The finale of this battle was the conference at Nagna Sebuloh to sign a peace Saribas treaty to end piracy and headhunting but the natives refused to sign it, rendering the treaty moot.

In 1844, Brooke&#x27;s force attacked Batang Lupar, Batang Undop, and Batang Skrang to defeat the Malay sharifs and Dayak living in these regions. The Malay sharifs were easily defeated at Patusin in Batang Lupar, without a major fight despite their famous reputation and power over the native inlanders. However, during the battle of Batang Undop, one of Brooke&#x27;s men, British Navy officer Mr. Charles Wade was killed in action at the battle of Ulu Undop while chasing the Malay sheriffs upriver. Subsequently, Brooke&#x27;s Malay force headed by Datu Patinggi Ali and Mr. Steward was totally defeated by the Skrang Iban force at the battle of Kerangan Peris in the Batang Skrang region.

In 1849, at the Battle of Beting Maru, a convoy of Dayak boats that were returning from a sojourn at the River Rajan spotted Brooke&#x27;s man of war, the &quot;Nemesis&quot;. They then landed on the Beting Maru sandbar and retreated to their villages, with two Dayak boats acting as a diversion by sailing towards the &quot;Nemesis&quot; and engaging her, with the two boats managing to retreat safely after a few shots were exchanged. The next day, the Dayak ambushed Brooke&#x27;s pursuing force, killing two of Brooke&#x27;s Iban entourage before pulling back.

Layang, the son-in-law of Libau &quot;Rentap&quot; was known as the first Iban slayer of a white man in the person of Mr. Alan Lee &quot;Ti Mati Rugi&quot; (died in vain) at the Battle of Lintang Batang in 1853, above the Skrang fort built by Brooke in 1850. The Brooke government had to launch three successive punitive expeditions against Libau Rentap to conquer his fortress known as Sadok Mount.
In total, the Brooke government conducted 52 punitive expeditions against the Iban including one against the Kayan.
The Sarawak Rangers which were mostly Dayak participated in the anti-communist insurgency during the Malayan Emergency between 1948 and 1960. The Sarawak Rangers were despatched by the British to fight during the Brunei Rebellion in 1962.

==Military contributions==

The Iban are famous for being fearsome warriors in the past in defence of homeland or for migration to virgin territories. Two highly decorated Iban Dayak soldiers from Sarawak in Malaysia are Temenggung Datuk and Kanang anak Langkau (awarded the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa or Grand Knight of Valour) and Awang anak Raweng of Skrang (awarded a George Cross). So far, only one Dayak has reached the rank of general in the military, Brigadier-General Stephen Mundaw in the Malaysian Army, who was promoted on 1 November 2010.

Malaysia&#x27;s most decorated war hero is Kanang Anak Langkau for his military service helping to liberate Malaya (and later Malaysia) from the communists, being the only soldier awarded both Seri Pahlawan (The Star of the Commander of Valour) and Panglima Gagah Berani (The Star of Valour). Among all the heroes are 21 holders of the Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) including 2 recipients of the Seri Pahlawan. Of this total, there are 14 Ibans, two Chinese army officers, one Bidayuh, one Kayan and one Malay. But the majority of the Armed Forces are Malays, according to a book – &quot;Crimson Tide over Borneo&quot;. The youngest of the PGB holders is ASP Wilfred Gomez of the police force.

There were six holders of Sri Pahlawan (SP) and Panglima Gagah Perkasa from Sarawak, and with the death of Kanang Anak Langkau, there is one SP holder in the person of Sgt. Ngalinuh (an Orang Ulu).

<text>Samuel Lewis Southard (June 9, 1787June 26, 1842) was a prominent American statesman of the early 19th century, serving as a U.S. Senator, Secretary of the Navy, and the tenth governor of New Jersey. He also served as President pro tempore of the Senate, and was briefly first in the presidential line of succession.

==History==

The son of Henry Southard and Sarah (Lewis) Southard, Henry was born in the Basking Ridge section of Bernards Township, New Jersey, on June 9, 1787. Southard&#x27;s ancestors included Anthony Janszoon van Salee, one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam (of partial Moorish descent), and his siblings included Isaac Southard. Southard attended the Brick Academy classical school and graduated from Princeton University in 1804.

===Early career===

After teaching in New Jersey, he worked for several years as a tutor in the Virginia home of John Taliaferro, his father&#x27;s congressional colleague. While living in Virginia, Southard studied law with Francis T. Brooke and Judge Williams, both of Fredericksburg. Upon being admitted to the bar, he returned to New Jersey, and started his practice in Flemington in 1811. He was appointed law reporter by the New Jersey Legislature in 1814. Elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1815, Southard was appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court to succeed Mahlon Dickerson shortly thereafter, and in 1820 served as a presidential elector. He was elected to a seat in the United States Senate over James J. Wilson, and was appointed to the remainder of Wilson&#x27;s term After Wilson resigned. Southard served in office from January 26, 1821, to March 3, 1823, when he resigned. During this time, he was a member of the committee that produced the Missouri Compromise.

===Navy career===

President James Monroe selected Senator Southard to be Secretary of the Navy in September 1823, and he remained in office under President John Quincy Adams. During these years, he also served briefly as &quot;ad interim&quot; Secretary of the Treasury (1825) and Secretary of War (1828). Southard proved to be one of the most effective of the Navy&#x27;s early Secretaries. He endeavored to enlarge the Navy and improve its administration, purchased land for the first Naval Hospitals, began construction of the first Navy dry docks, undertook surveys of U.S. coastal waters and promoted exploration in the Pacific Ocean. Responding to actions by influential officers, including David Porter, he reinforced the American tradition of civilian control over the military establishment. Also on Southard&#x27;s watch, the Navy grew by some 50% in personnel and expenditures and expanded its reach into waters that had not previously seen an American man-of-war.

===Political life===

In 1829 Southard became New Jersey Attorney General, succeeding Theodore Frelinghuysen. In 1832, the state legislature elected him Governor over Peter D. Vroom by a vote of 40 to 24. In 1833, he was again elected to the U.S. Senate. During the next decade, he was a leader of the Whig Party and attained national prominence as chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. As President pro tempore of the Senate, he was first in the presidential line of succession after the death of William Henry Harrison and the accession of Vice President John Tyler to the presidency.

Failing health forced Southard to resign from the Senate in 1842. He died in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on June 26, 1842. Southard was buried in Washington&#x27;s Congressional Cemetery.

===Societies===

During the 1820s, Southard was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. In 1839, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

===Legacy===

The destroyer , (later DMS-10), 1919–1946, was named in his honor.
There is also a public park in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, named after him. There is also a street named after him in Key West, FL as well as Southard Street in Trenton, New Jersey.

<text>The highest specific impulse chemical rockets use liquid propellants (liquid-propellant rockets). They can consist of a single chemical (a monopropellant) or a mix of two chemicals, called bipropellants. Bipropellants can further be divided into two categories; hypergolic propellants, which ignite when the fuel and oxidizer make contact, and non-hypergolic propellants which require an ignition source.

About 170 different propellants made of liquid fuel have been tested, excluding minor changes to a specific propellant such as propellant additives, corrosion inhibitors, or stabilizers. In the U.S. alone at least 25 different propellant combinations have been flown.

Many factors go into choosing a propellant for a liquid-propellant rocket engine. The primary factors include ease of operation, cost, hazards/environment and performance.

==History==

===Development in early 20th century===
Konstantin Tsiolkovsky proposed the use of liquid propellants in 1903, in his article &quot;Exploration of Outer Space by Means of Rocket Devices.&quot;

On March 16, 1926, Robert H. Goddard used liquid oxygen (&quot;LOX&quot;) and gasoline as propellants for his first partially successful liquid-propellant rocket launch. Both propellants are readily available, cheap and highly energetic. Oxygen is a moderate cryogen as air will not liquefy against a liquid oxygen tank, so it is possible to store LOX briefly in a rocket without excessive insulation. 

In Germany, engineers and scientists began building and testing liquid propulsion rockets in the late 1920s. According to Max Valier, two liquid-propellant Opel RAK rockets were launched in Rüsselsheim on April 10 and April 12, 1929.

===World War II era===
Germany had very active rocket development before and during World War II, both for the strategic V-2 rocket and other missiles. The V-2 used an alcohol/LOX liquid-propellant engine, with hydrogen peroxide to drive the fuel pumps. The alcohol was mixed with water for engine cooling. Both Germany and the United States developed reusable liquid-propellant rocket engines that used a storeable liquid oxidizer with much greater density than LOX and a liquid fuel that ignited spontaneously on contact with the high density oxidizer.[&quot;&quot;] 

The major manufacturer of German rocket engines for military use, the HWK firm, manufactured the RLM-numbered 109-500-designation series of rocket engine systems, and either used hydrogen peroxide as a monopropellant for &quot;Starthilfe&quot; rocket-propulsive assisted takeoff needs; or as a form of thrust for MCLOS-guided air-sea glide bombs; and used in a bipropellant combination of the same oxidizer with a fuel mixture of hydrazine hydrate and methyl alcohol for rocket engine systems intended for manned combat aircraft propulsion purposes. 

The U.S. engine designs were fueled with the bipropellant combination of nitric acid as the oxidizer; and aniline as the fuel. Both engines were used to power aircraft, the Me 163 Komet interceptor in the case of the Walter 509-series German engine designs, and RATO units from both nations (as with the &quot;Starthilfe&quot; system for the Luftwaffe) to assist take-off of aircraft, which comprised the primary purpose for the case of the U.S. liquid-fueled rocket engine technology - much of it coming from the mind of U.S. Navy officer Robert Truax.

===1950s and 1960s===

During the 1950s and 1960s there was a great burst of activity by propellant chemists to find high-energy liquid and solid propellants better suited to the military. Large strategic missiles need to sit in land-based or submarine-based silos for many years, able to launch at a moment&#x27;s notice. Propellants requiring continuous refrigeration, which cause their rockets to grow ever-thicker blankets of ice, were not practical. As the military was willing to handle and use hazardous materials, a great number of dangerous chemicals were brewed up in large batches, most of which wound up being deemed unsuitable for operational systems.[&quot;&quot;] In the case of nitric acid, the acid itself () was unstable, and corroded most metals, making it difficult to store. The addition of a modest amount of nitrogen tetroxide, , turned the mixture red and kept it from changing composition, but left the problem that nitric acid corrodes containers it is placed in, releasing gases that can build up pressure in the process. The breakthrough was the addition of a little hydrogen fluoride (HF), which forms a self-sealing metal fluoride on the interior of tank walls that &quot;Inhibited&quot; Red Fuming Nitric Acid. This made &quot;IRFNA&quot; storeable. 

Propellant combinations based on IRFNA or pure as oxidizer and kerosene or hypergolic (self igniting) aniline, hydrazine or unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) as fuel were then adopted in the United States and the Soviet Union for use in strategic and tactical missiles. The self-igniting storeable liquid bi-propellants have somewhat lower specific impulse than LOX/kerosene but have higher density so a greater mass of propellant can be placed in the same sized tanks. Gasoline was replaced by different hydrocarbon fuels, for example RP-1 a highly refined grade of kerosene. This combination is quite practical for rockets that need not be stored.

==Kerosene==

The V-2 rockets developed by Nazi Germany used LOX and ethyl alcohol. One of the main advantages of alcohol was its water content, which provided cooling in larger rocket engines. Petroleum-based fuels offered more power than alcohol, but standard gasoline and kerosene left too much soot and combustion by-products that could clog engine plumbing. In addition, they lacked the cooling properties of ethyl alcohol.

During the early 1950s, the chemical industry in the US was assigned the task of formulating an improved petroleum-based rocket propellant which would not leave residue behind and also ensure that the engines would remain cool. The result was RP-1, the specifications of which were finalized by 1954. A highly refined form of jet fuel, RP-1 burned much more cleanly than conventional petroleum fuels and also posed less of a danger to ground personnel from explosive vapours. It became the propellant for most of the early American rockets and ballistic missiles such as the Atlas, Titan I, and Thor. The Soviets quickly adopted RP-1 for their R-7 missile, but the majority of Soviet launch vehicles ultimately used storable hypergolic propellants. , it is used in the first stages of many orbital launchers.

==Hydrogen==
Many early rocket theorists believed that hydrogen would be a marvelous propellant, since it gives the highest specific impulse. It is also considered the cleanest when oxidized with oxygen because the only by-product is water. Steam reforming of natural gas is the most common method of producing commercial bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production of in 1998. At high temperatures (700–1100 °C) and in the presence of a metal-based catalyst (nickel), steam reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

Hydrogen is very bulky compared to other fuels; it is typically stored as a cryogenic liquid, a technique mastered in the early 1950s as part of the hydrogen bomb development program at Los Alamos. Liquid hydrogen can be stored and transported without boil-off, by using helium as a cooling refrigerant, since helium has an even lower boiling point than hydrogen. Hydrogen is lost via venting to the atmosphere only after it is loaded onto a launch vehicle, where there is no refrigeration.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s it was adopted for hydrogen-fuelled stages such as Centaur and Saturn upper stages. Hydrogen has low density even as a liquid, requiring large tanks and pumps; maintaining the necessary extreme cold requires tank insulation. This extra weight reduces the mass fraction of the stage or requires extraordinary measures such as pressure stabilization of the tanks to reduce weight. (Pressure stabilized tanks support most of the loads with internal pressure rather than with solid structures, employing primarily the tensile strength of the tank material.)

The Soviet rocket programme, in part due to a lack of technical capability, did not use liquid hydrogen as a propellant until the Energia core stage in the 1980s.

===Upper stage use===
The liquid-rocket engine bipropellant liquid oxygen and hydrogen offers the highest specific impulse for conventional rockets. This extra performance largely offsets the disadvantage of low density, which requires larger fuel tanks. However, a small increase in specific impulse in an upper stage application can give a significant increase in payload-to-orbit mass.

===Comparison to kerosene===

Launch pad fires due to spilled kerosene are more damaging than hydrogen fires, for two main reasons:
*Kerosene burns about 20% hotter in absolute temperature than hydrogen.
*Hydrogen&#x27;s buoyancy. Since hydrogen is a deep cryogen it boils quickly and rises, due to its very low density as a gas. Even when hydrogen burns, the gaseous that is formed has a molecular weight of only 18  compared to 29.9  for air, so it also rises quickly. Spilled kerosene fuel, on the other hand, falls to the ground and if ignited can burn for hours when spilled in large quantities.
Kerosene fires unavoidably cause extensive heat damage that requires time-consuming repairs and rebuilding. This is most frequently experienced by test stand crews involved with firings of large, unproven rocket engines.

Hydrogen-fuelled engines require special design, such as running propellant lines horizontally, so that no &quot;traps&quot; form in the lines, which would cause pipe ruptures due to boiling in confined spaces. (The same caution applies to other cryogens such as liquid oxygen and liquid natural gas (LNG).) Liquid hydrogen fuel has an excellent safety record and performance that is well above all other practical chemical rocket propellants.

==Lithium and fluorine==
The highest-specific-impulse chemistry ever test-fired in a rocket engine was lithium and fluorine, with hydrogen added to improve the exhaust thermodynamics (all propellants had to be kept in their own tanks, making this a tripropellant). The combination delivered 542 s specific impulse in vacuum, equivalent to an exhaust velocity of 5320 m/s. The impracticality of this chemistry highlights why exotic propellants are not actually used: to make all three components liquids, the hydrogen must be kept below −252 °C (just 21 K), and the lithium must be kept above 180 °C (453 K). Lithium and fluorine are both extremely corrosive. Lithium ignites on contact with air, and fluorine ignites most fuels on contact, including hydrogen. Fluorine and the hydrogen fluoride (HF) in the exhaust are very toxic, which makes working around the launch pad difficult, damages the environment, and makes getting a launch license more difficult. Both lithium and fluorine are expensive compared to most rocket propellants. This combination has therefore never flown.

During the 1950s, the Department of Defense proposed lithium/fluorine as ballistic-missile propellants. A 1954 accident at a chemical works that released a cloud of fluorine into the atmosphere convinced them to use LOX/RP-1 instead.

==Methane==
Using liquid methane and liquid oxygen as propellants is sometimes called methalox propulsion.
Liquid methane has a lower specific impulse than liquid hydrogen, but is easier to store due to its higher boiling point and density, as well as its lack of hydrogen embrittlement. It also leaves less residue in the engines compared to kerosene, which is beneficial for reusability. In addition, it is expected that its production on Mars will be possible via the Sabatier reaction. In NASA&#x27;s Mars Design Reference Mission 5.0 documents (between 2009 and 2012), liquid methane/LOX (methalox) was the chosen propellant mixture for the lander module.

Due to the advantages methane fuel offers, some private space launch providers aimed to develop methane-based launch systems during the 2010s and 2020s. The competition between countries was dubbed the Methalox Race to Orbit, with the LandSpace&#x27;s Zhuque-2 methalox rocket becoming the first to reach orbit.

, three methane-fueled rockets have reached orbit. Several others are in development and two orbital launch attempts failed:
* Zhuque-2 successfully reached orbit on its second flight on 12 July 2023, becoming the first methane-fueled rocket to do so. It had failed to reach orbit on its maiden flight on 14 December 2022. The rocket, developed by LandSpace, uses the TQ-12 engine.
* Vulcan Centaur successfully reached orbit on its first try, called Cert-1, on 8 January 2024. The rocket, developed by United Launch Alliance, uses the Blue Origin&#x27;s BE-4 engine, though the second stage uses the hydrolox RL10.
* New Glenn successfully reached orbit on its first try on 16 January 2025. The rocket and its engines are developed by Blue Origin. The first stage uses BE-4 engines, and the second stage uses the hydrolox BE-3U.
* Terran 1 had a failed orbital launch attempt on its maiden flight on 22 March 2023, and the development of the rocket was terminated. The rocket, developed by Relativity Space, uses the Aeon 1 engine.
* Starship achieved a transatmospheric orbit on its third flight on 14 March 2024, after two failed attempts. The rocket, developed by SpaceX, uses the Raptor engine.
* Nova is being developed by Stoke Space. The first stage uses methalox Zenith engine, and the second stage uses a hydrolox engine.

SpaceX developed the Raptor engine for its Starship super-heavy-lift launch vehicle. It has been used in test flights since 2019. SpaceX had previously used only RP-1/LOX and hypergolics in their engines.

Blue Origin developed the BE-4 LOX/LNG engine for their New Glenn and the United Launch Alliance Vulcan Centaur. The BE-4 provides 2,400 kN (550,000 lbf) of thrust. Two flight engines had been delivered to ULA by mid 2023.

ESA is developing a 980kN methalox Prometheus rocket engine which was test fired in 2023.

==Monopropellants==

;High-test peroxide: High test peroxide is concentrated Hydrogen peroxide, with around 2% to 30% water. It decomposes to steam and oxygen when passed over a catalyst. This was historically used for reaction control systems, due to being easily storable. It is often used to drive Turbopumps, being used on the V2 rocket, and modern Soyuz.
;Hydrazine: decomposes energetically to nitrogen, hydrogen, and ammonia (2N2H4 → N2+H2+2NH3) and is the most widely used in space vehicles. (Non-oxidized ammonia decomposition is endothermic and would decrease performance).
;Nitrous oxide: decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen.
;Steam: when externally heated gives a reasonably modest Isp of up to 190 seconds, depending on material corrosion and thermal limits.

==Present use==
, liquid fuel combinations in common use:

;Kerosene (RP-1) / liquid oxygen (LOX): Used for the lower stages of the Soyuz-2, Long March 6, Long March 7, Long March 8, and Tianlong-2; boosters of Long March 5; the first stage of Atlas V; and both stages of Electron, Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, Firefly Alpha, and Long March 12.
;Liquid hydrogen (LH) / LOX: Used in the stages of the Space Launch System, New Shepard, H3, GSLV, Long March 5, Long March 7A, Long March 8, Ariane 6, New Glenn and Centaur.
;Liquid methane (LNG) / LOX: Used in both stages of Zhuque-2, Starship (doing nearly orbital test flights), and the first stage of the Vulcan Centaur and New Glenn.
;Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) or monomethylhydrazine (MMH) / dinitrogen tetroxide (NTO or ): Used in three first stages of the Russian Proton booster, Indian Vikas engine for PSLV and GSLV rockets, many Chinese boosters, a number of military, orbital and deep space rockets, as this fuel combination is hypergolic and storable for long periods at reasonable temperatures and pressures.
;Hydrazine (): Used in deep space missions because it is storable and hypergolic, and can be used as a monopropellant with a catalyst.
;Aerozine-50 (50/50 hydrazine and UDMH): Used in deep space missions because it is storable and hypergolic, and can be used as a monopropellant with a catalyst.

<text>Henry Southard (October 7, 1747 – May 22, 1842) was a United States Representative from the state of New Jersey.

Southard was born in Hempstead, Long Island, New York. He moved with his parents to the Basking Ridge section of Bernards Township, New Jersey in 1755, where he attended the common schools and worked on a farm. Later, Southard served as a private and later as wagon master during the American Revolution. After the war, he engaged in agriculture, before serving as a Justice of the Peace from 1787 to 1792. Later, he served as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly, from 1797 to 1799 and again in 1811. He was elected as a Democratic-Republican to the 7th United States Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses, where he served from March 4, 1801 to March 3, 1811. During the 11th Congress, Southard was Chairman of the Committee on Revisal and Unfinished Business. He was later elected to the 14th, 15th, and 16th Congresses, serving from March 4, 1815 to March 3, 1821. After leaving Congress for good, Southard returned to farming. He died in Basking Ridge in Somerset County, New Jersey, and was interred in Basking Ridge Cemetery.

Henry Southard was the father of Isaac Southard and Samuel Lewis Southard.

<doc id="1079015" wikidata="Q4957574" url="?curid=1079015" title="Branston Hall">
<text>Branston Hall is a country house in the village of Branston, Lincolnshire, England. The hall, a Grade II listed building, is set in 88 acres (3.56 square kilometres) of wooded parkland and lakes.

Originally commissioned as the family seat of the Melville family, the house became an RAF hospital during the Second World War, and then a sanatorium run by Lindsey County Council. It lay derelict in the 1970s and 1980s, underwent restoration and conversion into a retirement home in the late 1980s, and is now restored and converted into a three-star hotel. Weddings are often held at the hotel.

Designed by John Macvicar Anderson in 1885, the house was built in Elizabethan Revival style.

==Early history==

Branston Hall Grounds were the inherited estate of Sir Cecil Wray 11th Baronet (1678–1736) (a descendant of Catherine Parr), whose family had been Baronets and parliamentarians in Lincolnshire since 1611 (see also Wray Baronets), and whose main residence was in Fillingham, north of Lincoln. Busts of Sir Cecil and his wife Mary can be seen in Branston All Saints Church. The property was inherited from Sir Cecil by his daughter out of wedlock, Anne Casey. Anne Casey married Lord Vere Bertie (1712–1768), the son of the 1st Duke of Ancaster. In 1735 Lord Vere Bertie built Branston old hall (a building which preceded the current Branston Hall, and which was located on a different part of the grounds, beside Hall Lane) The couple had four children. Lord Vere Bertie died in 1768 and his wife Anne continued to live at the house until her death in 1779. The property was then passed to their daughter Albinia who had married George Hobart, 3rd Earl of Buckinghamshire. In 1829, the old hall was advertised for sale and it seems that shortly after this it was purchased by Alexander Leslie Melville (1800–1881).

==The Leslie-Melville family==
Alexander Leslie Melville (1800–1881) was born in 1800 in Scotland. His father was Alexander Leslie Melville, the 7th Earl of Leven. In 1825, he married Charlotte Smith, the daughter of Samuel Smith M.P, of Woodhall Park, Hertfordshire. The couple had twelve children.

Their eldest son was Alexander Samuel Leslie Melville (1829–1919) and he inherited Branston old hall when his father died in 1881. He was born in 1829 and in 1858 he married Albinia Frances Broderick, daughter of Charles Brodrick, 6th Viscount Midleton. The couple had seven children.

In 1837 Alexander Leslie Melville constructed a private school on Hall Lane, which was attended by 70 children, each of whom paid 1p-2p per week.

In 1884, he commissioned the architect John MacVicar Anderson to build the present house. The old hall, still being in a good state of repair became accommodation for the servants and the staff. There were numerous servants employed by the family. The 1901 Census shows that there were six domestic maids, a butler, three footmen and a groom at the hall as well as outdoor gardening staff.

In 1903, the old hall burnt down and was removed from the site. Photos of the old hall have been preserved by Branston History Group. Albinia died in 1918 and Alexander died the following year in 1919. In 1920, the property was sold. In the intervening years the site of the old hall has been sensitively redeveloped.

The Melville family provided land for the village hall and recreation ground on Lincoln Road, Branston in the early 1920s. The heir of the Leslie-Melville family is the Lord Balgonie, and many items from Branston Hall are now found on the family&#x27;s estate in the Scottish Highlands.

==Grounds==

The grounds were once grazed by sheep but since around the year 2000 have been mechanically mown. There are many large beech trees and sycamores. Wildlife include muntjac deer, tawny owl and great cormorant. &quot;Lamium galeobdolon&quot;, &quot;Galium odoratum&quot; and &quot;Ruscus aculeatus&quot; grow in the beech woods and these are considered to be indicators of ancient woodland. Other plant species typical of shady woodland include &quot;Hyacinthoides non-scripta&quot;, &quot;Sanicula europaea&quot; and &quot;Mercurialis perennis&quot;.

In 1906, 10 Bronze Age axes were found on the grounds of Branston Hall.

On the grounds there is a spring-fed well, known as Anne&#x27;s Well, which it is believed supplied fresh water to the old hall building (photographs here). The well was probably named after Anne Casey, who owned the property in the 1700s, or possibly St. Anne. It is covered with a stone which bore the inscription:

 &quot;Clear may thy Waters ever flow,

Nor Gusts of Ruffling Tempest know,

Pure and unsullied as the fair

Whose Emblematic Name you bear&quot;

There is evidence of boating on the lake, in former times (remains of a small boat and boathouse).

<text>Educated Guess is the 13th album by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, released January 20, 2004 (see 2004 in music). It was recorded alone at her homes in Buffalo, New York and New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Critical reception==

The album so far has a score of 67 out of 100 from Metacritic based on &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. &quot;Filter&quot; gave it a score of 74% and said that DiFranco &quot;dives into a murkier, less-definable world that is part acoustic neo-soul, part spoken word and dreamier than you might imagine.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave it a positive review and stated that it &quot;benefits from DiFranco&#x27;s emphasis on spare shimmer, though it also perpetuates her recent tendency to let her songs languidly drift along, for better and for worse.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; also gave it a positive review and stated that &quot;It&#x27;s worth putting up with a few overbearing moments to hear someone so willing to take chances.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; likewise gave the album a positive review and said it was &quot;Characterized by production rawness—for better (the immediacy of the performance) and worse (traces of off-key harmonies).&quot;

Other reviews were average, mixed, or negative: &quot;Q&quot; gave it three stars out of five and said of DiFranco, &quot;The jazzy stylings are a mixed blessing... [but] her fans will not be disappointed.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album only two stars out of five and stated that the &quot;awkward, improbable tendency goes unchecked, as does DiFranco&#x27;s penchant for jarring arrangements.&quot; E! Online gave it a D and called the album &quot;so staccato and nonlinear, a sort of free-jazz version of rock with just too much going on and little worth hearing.&quot;

The album reached No. 55 on the Australian ARIA albums chart in January 2004, and spent five weeks in the top 100.

<text>Gus Kartes (born October 19, 1981), also known by his Greek name Kostas Karterouliotis, is an American retired soccer player who played as a striker.

Kartes initially became notable in 1996 when, at the age of 15, he signed a five-year, $2 million contract with Greek club Olympiacos, becoming the youngest player to ever sign a first-division contract in Greece. Kartes did not fulfill Olympiakos&#x27;s hopes, however, garnering little first team playing time, and eventually bought out his contract with a year remaining in order to return to America and play in Major League Soccer. Upon returning to the United States, the Colorado Rapids acquired Kartes in a lottery, but traded him to his hometown Tampa Bay Mutiny in exchange for draft picks. Kartes played the 2001 season for the Mutiny, but was largely unimpressive, registering no points in 516 minutes. After the Mutiny were contracted at the end of the 2001 season, Kartes went undrafted in the allocation and dispersal drafts.

Following this, Kartes returned to Greece to play for Kalamata FC of the Greek second division. He returned to the United States in 2004 to sign with the Chicago Storm of the Major Indoor Soccer League. The Storm was coached by fellow Greek-American Frank Klopas.

<doc id="1079041" wikidata="Q16160926" url="?curid=1079041" title="The Love of Richard Nixon">
<text>&quot;The Love of Richard Nixon&quot; is a song by Welsh alternative rock band Manic Street Preachers. It was released on 18 October 2004 by Sony Music UK as the first single from their seventh studio album, &quot;Lifeblood&quot; (2004), and reached number two on the UK Singles Chart.

==Content==
The song is, according to the band, &quot;a soundtrack to disillusion, hatred, love and never giving up&quot;. More specifically, the song is a sympathetic appraisal of former US president Richard Nixon and mentions some of his positive achievements, inevitably overshadowed by the Watergate Scandal. The timing of the single&#x27;s release, two weeks before George W. Bush&#x27;s victory at the 2004 US presidential elections, can also be seen as a statement by the band concerning the reputation of the USA&#x27;s leadership at the time.
In an interview with Repeat Fanzine, the band also said it represents how they feel in comparison to Radiohead. Nicky in particular commented that they feel like Richard Nixon compared to Radiohead&#x27;s John F. Kennedy: &quot;&#x27;If Radiohead are Kennedy, then Manic Street Preachers are Nixon: the ugly duckling who had to try 10 times harder than anyone else. Paranoid megalomaniacs.&#x27;&quot;

The sound is more electronic than most of their previous hits, indicative of a slight switch in sound on &quot;Lifeblood&quot;; according to the band the song contains no guitars.

==Release and reception==
&quot;The Love of Richard Nixon&quot; was released on 18 October 2004 by record label Sony Music UK as the first single from the band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;Lifebood&quot;. Unusually, the three formats of the single—two CDs and a DVD—could be bought together for £5 at most record stores, encouraging multiple purchases of the single. The song reached number two on the UK Singles Chart, number 15 on the Spanish Singles Chart, and number 17 on the Irish Singles Chart.

<text>Tarimela Nagi Reddy (11 February 1917 – 28 July 1976) was a communist politician from Andhra Pradesh, India. He was born in a wealthy family in Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. He completed his schooling from the Rishi Valley School India, founded by Andhra philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. He would later study at Loyola College in Chennai and at Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi. During his student days, he got involved with nationalism and Marxism. His political activities got him jailed in 1940, 1941 and 1946. He revolted against his father who was a landlord and donated his land of over 1000 acres to landless labourers.

Reddy was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly as a Communist Party of India candidate in 1951 from Anantapuram. He was elected to the Lok Sabha from Anantapuram in 1957. In 1962 he was elected to the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly as a Communist Party of India candidate from Puttur. In 1967 he was again elected to the assembly, now as a Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) candidate from Anantapuram. Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, a two-time Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh and the sixth President of India, was Nagi Reddy&#x27;s brother-in-law.

In 1968, T.N. Reddy broke with the CPI(M) and formed the Andhra Pradesh Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (APCCCR). He succeeded in attracting a large part of the CPI(M) cadre to APCCCR. During a brief period APCCCR was part of All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries (AICCCR). Reddy was however very critical of the left adventurist line of Charu Majumdar. Instead, he wanted to promote a mass line. Thus, Reddy and the APCCCR were expelled from the AICCCR.

In 1975, Unity Centre of Communist Revolutionaries of India (Marxist-Leninist) was formed through the merger of the APCCCR with three other smaller groups. T.N. Reddy worked as a leader of APCCCR until his death in 1976. His most famous work is &quot;India Mortgaged.&quot;

Siblings:
Tarimela Ranga Reddy, MLA and Samithi President
Tarimela Krishna Reddy, Samithi President
Tarimela Ramadoss Reddy, Communist leader.

<text>The Oxford Wits, a term coined later, were an identifiable group of literary and intellectual aesthetes and dandies, present as undergraduates at the University of Oxford in England in the first half of the 1920s.

Their leader in fashion was Harold Acton, but their later leader in intellectual matters was more noticeably Maurice Bowra. Their attitudes were those portrayed and parodied in the nostalgic &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; of Evelyn Waugh, the most important literary figure to emerge from the group.

Others who are cited as Oxford Wits are John Betjeman, Robert Byron, Cyril Connolly, Brian Howard, Alan Pryce-Jones, John Sparrow, John Sutro, and Christopher Sykes.

The origin of the Wonnarua language is unclear; however, linguists group closely related dialects together under the description &quot;language of the Hunter River/Lake Macquarie&quot; (HRLM). That term denotes the geographical location of the closely related dialects rather than the name of the language group. The area extends from north of the Hawkesbury–MacDonald River (HMR) language and south of the Lower North Coast language (LNC). Exact geographical locations of the language groups are, at this stage, speculative.

==Country==
Their traditional territory, estimated to comprise an area extending over , spreads from the Upper Hunter River above Maitland, west to the Great Dividing Range, towards Wollombi. The Wonnarua were bounded to the north by the Geawegal people, to the north–east by the Worimi peoples, to the south east by the Awabakal people, to the south by the Darkinung and to the west by the Wiradjuri people. The Wonnarua also had trade and ceremonial links with the Kamilaroi people.

==People==
The Wonnarua, at the beginning of contact with whites, are estimated to have numbered around 500.

The Gringai were a clan of the Worimi, whose traditional lands are in the Dungog area.

==Native title==
On behalf of the Plains Clans of the Wonnarua People, Scott Franks and Anor put in a native title claim on 19 August 2013. The document claimed rights over an area of roughly , embracing the catchment zone within the Great Dividing Range, the Liverpool Range, and the major rivers coming out of the Barringtons, under Yango. The claim included Singleton, Muswellbrook, Dungog, Maitland, and the shire council lands of the Upper Hunter. The claim was registered in January 2015 and referred to the Federal Court to deliberate over the claim and to make a determination. However, it was ultimately discontinued and removed from the register of native title claims on 2 March 2020. The discontinuance appears to have been the result of disputes with other Aboriginal people who claimed native title in the area but in a different way and these disputes led to an independent anthropologist, Dr Lee Sackett, being appointed by the Court to prepare a report to resolve the different views of native title in the area. Dr Sackett&#x27;s conclusions were to the effect that key details of the claim&#x27;s structure were not supported by the evidence.

<text>The  () was a pogrom carried out against the Jewish population of Baghdad, Iraq, on 1–2 June 1941 (coinciding with the Jewish holiday of Shavuot), immediately following the British victory in the Anglo-Iraqi War. The riots occurred in a power vacuum that followed the collapse of the pro-Nazi government of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani while the city was in a state of instability. The violence came immediately after the rapid defeat of Rashid Ali by British forces, whose earlier coup had generated a short period of national euphoria, and was fueled by allegations that Iraqi Jews had aided the British. More than 180 Jews were killed and 1,000 injured, although some non-Jewish rioters were also killed in the attempt to quell the violence. Looting of Jewish property took place and 900 Jewish homes were destroyed.

On account of the role of Axis and pro-Axis elements in inciting and eventually carrying out the pogrom, it is often argued to have constituted the extension of the Shoah in Iraq, though this classification, and even its inclusion as part of the wider Holocaust, have been disputed. In any case, as with other persecutions of Jews outside of Europe, it is often overlooked when compared to the Holocaust in Europe, especially outside of Israel (where the vast majority of Iraqi Jews, as well as their descendants, currently live).

The event spurred a migration of Iraqi Jews out of the country, although a direct connection to the 1951–1952 Jewish exodus from Iraq is also disputed, as many Jews who left Iraq immediately following the Farhud later returned to the country, and permanent Jewish emigration out of Iraq did not accelerate significantly until 1950–1951. 

==Background==
===Independence of Iraq===
After the Ottoman Empire was defeated in World WarI, the League of Nations granted the mandate of Iraq to Britain. After King Ghazi who inherited the throne of FaisalI, died in a 1939 car accident, Britain installed &#x27;Abd al-Ilah as Iraq&#x27;s governing regent.

By 1941 the approximately 150,000 Iraqi Jews played active roles in many aspects of Iraqi life, including farming, banking, commerce and the government bureaucracy.

===Iraq in World War II===
Iraqi nationalist Rashid Ali al-Gaylani was appointed prime minister again in 1940, and attempted to ally with the Axis powers in order to remove the remaining British influence in the country.

Much of the population had retained significant anti-British sentiments since the 1920 Iraqi revolt, although the Jewish population was viewed as pro-British during World WarII, contributing to the separation of the Muslim and Jewish communities.

In addition, between 1932 and 1941, the German embassy in Iraq, headed by Dr. Fritz Grobba, significantly supported antisemitic and fascist movements. Intellectuals and army officers were invited to Germany as guests of the Nazi party, and antisemitic material was published in the newspapers. The German embassy purchased the newspaper &quot;Al-alam Al-arabi&quot; (&quot;The Arab world&quot;) which published, in addition to antisemitic propaganda, a translation of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in Arabic. The German embassy also supported the establishment of Al-Fatwa, a youth organization based upon the model of the Hitler Youth.

==Events preceding the Farhud==
===The Golden Square coup===

In 1941 a group of pro-Nazi Iraqi officers, known as the &quot;Golden Square&quot; and led by General Rashid Ali, overthrew Regent Abdul Ilah on April 1 after staging a successful coup. The coup had significant popular support, particularly in Baghdad. Historian Orit Bashkin writes that &quot;All, apparently, yearned for the departure of the British after two long decades of interference in Iraqi affairs&quot;.

Iraq&#x27;s new government then was quickly involved in confrontation with the British over the terms of the military treaty forced on Iraq at independence. The treaty gave the British unlimited rights to base troops in Iraq and transit troops through Iraq. The British arranged to land large numbers of soldiers from India in Iraq to force the country to show its intentions. Iraq refused to let them land and confrontations afterward occurred both near Basra in the south and to the west of Baghdad near the British base complex and airfield. The Germans dispatched a group of 26 heavy fighters to aid in a futile air attack on the British airbase at Habbaniya which accomplished nothing.

Winston Churchill sent a telegram to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, warning him that if the Middle East fell to Germany, victory against the Nazis would be a &quot;hard, long and bleak proposition&quot; given that Hitler would have access to the oil reserves there. The telegram dealt with the larger issues of war in the Middle East rather than Iraq exclusively.

On 25 May Hitler issued his &quot;Order 30&quot;, stepping up German offensive operations: &quot;The Arab Freedom Movement in the Middle East is our natural ally against England. In this connection special importance is attached to the liberation of Iraq... I have therefore decided to move forward in the Middle East by supporting Iraq.&quot;

On 30 May the British-organized force called &quot;Kingcol&quot; led by Brigadier J.J. Kingstone reached Baghdad, causing the &quot;Golden Square&quot; and their supporters to escape via Iran to Germany. &quot;Kingcol&quot; included some elements of the Arab Legion led by Major John Bagot Glubb known as Glubb Pasha.

On 31 May Regent Abdul Illah prepared to fly back into Baghdad to reclaim his leadership. To avoid the impression of a British-organized countercoup, the regent entered Baghdad without a British escort.

Michael Eppel, in his book &quot;The Palestinian Conflict in Modern Iraq&quot;, blames the Farhud on the influence of German ideology on the Iraqi people, as well as extreme nationalism, both of which were heightened by the Golden Square coup.

===Antisemitic actions preceding the Farhud===
Sami Michael, a witness to the Farhud, testified: &quot;Antisemite propaganda was broadcast routinely by the local radio and Radio Berlin in Arabic. Various anti-Jewish slogans were written on walls on the way to school, such as &quot;Hitler was killing the Jewish germs&quot;. Shops owned by Muslims had &#x27;Muslim&#x27; written on them, so they would not be damaged in the case of anti-Jewish riots.&quot;

, the secretary of the Jewish community in Baghdad, testified that several days before the Farhud, the homes of Jews were marked with a red palm print (&quot;Hamsa&quot;), by al-Futuwa youth. Al-Sabawi also instructed Jews in Baghdad to pack suitcases and to wait to be taken to &quot;detention camps&quot; &quot;for their own safety&quot;.

Two days before the Farhud, Yunis al-Sabawi, a government minister who proclaimed himself the governor of Baghdad, summoned Rabbi Sasson Khaduri, the community leader, and recommended to him that Jews stay in their homes for the next three days as a protective measure. He had planned for a larger massacre, preparing to broadcast a call for the Baghdad public to massacre Jews. However, the broadcast was never made since al-Sabawi was forced to flee the country.

During the fall of the Rashid Ali government, false rumors were circulated that Jews used radios to signal the Royal Air Force and distributed British propaganda.

According to Hayyim Cohen, the Farhud &quot;was the only such instance of Jewish shops and synagogues destroyed, Jewish girls being gang raped, and mob violence known to the Jews of Iraq, at least during their last hundred years of life there&quot;. Historian Edy Cohen writes that up until the Farhud, Jews had enjoyed relatively favorable conditions and coexistence with Muslims in Iraq.

==Farhud (1–2 June 1941)==
According to Iraqi government and British historical sources violence started when a delegation of Jewish Iraqis arrived at the Palace of Flowers (Qasr al Zuhur) to meet with the Regent Abdullah, and were attacked en route by an Iraqi Arab mob as they crossed Al Khurr Bridge. Iraqi Arab civil disorder and violence then swiftly spread to the Al Rusafa and Abu Sifyan districts, and got worse the next day when elements of the Iraqi police began joining in with the attacks upon the Jewish population, involving shops belonging to it being set on fire and a synagogue being destroyed. Many Jewish girls were gang-raped and children maimed and killed in front of their families.

However, Zvi Yehuda, a professor of Jewish Studies, has suggested that the event that set off the rioting was anti-Jewish preaching in the Jami-Al-Gaylani mosque, and that the violence was premeditated rather than a spontaneous outburst.
Mordechai Ben-Porat, who later became the leader of the Iraqi Zionists, described his experience as follows:
We were mostly cut off from the center of the Jewish community and our Muslim neighbors became our friends. It was because of one Muslim neighbor, in fact, that we survived the Farhoud. We had no weapons to defend ourselves and were utterly helpless. We put furniture up against the doors and windows to prevent the rioters from breaking in. Then, Colonel Arif&#x27;s wife came rushing out of her house with a grenade and a pistol and shouted at the rioters, &#x27;If you don’t leave, I will explode this grenade right here!&#x27; Her husband was apparently not home and she had either been instructed by him to defend us or decided on her own to help. They dispersed, and that was thatshe saved our lives.

In some instances, common criminals came to the help of the Jews. In one case, a young Muslim woman, who, ironically, had been looting with her sister, saw a pogromist attacking a young Jewish man. The attacker responded by stabbing her to death. He was later convicted of murder and hanged. A man known to be a thief protected roughly 100 Jews in his neighborhood, forcing the local baker and grocery store owner to give them food. Jews themselves also fought back, using knives, rocks, pistols, and clubs.

The dean of Midrash Bet Zilkha, Yaakov Mutzafi, raced to open up the gates of the yeshiva to shelter the victims of the Farhud who were displaced from their homes, and secured money for their upkeep from philanthropists in the community.

Civil order was restored after two days of violence in the afternoon of 2 June, when Prime Minister Jamil Al Midfai imposed a curfew and shot violators on sight. An investigation conducted by British journalist Tony Rocca of the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; attributed the delay to a personal decision by Kinahan Cornwallis, the British Ambassador to Iraq, who failed to immediately carry out orders he received from the Foreign Office in the matter, and initially denied requests from British Imperial military and civil officers on the scene for permission to act against the attacking Arab mobs. The British also delayed their entry into Baghdad for 48 hours, which some testimonies suggest was due to having ulterior motives in allowing a clash to happen between Muslims and Jews in the city.

===Casualties===
The exact number of victims is uncertain. With respect to Jewish victims, some sources say that about 180 Jewish Iraqis were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed. Other accounts state that nearly 200 were killed and more than 2,000 injured, while 900 Jewish homes and hundreds of Jewish-owned shops destroyed and looted. The Israeli-based Babylonian Jewry Heritage Center maintains that in addition to 180 identified victims, around another 600 unidentified ones were buried in a mass grave. Zvi Zameret of Israel&#x27;s Education Ministry says 180 were killed and 700 wounded. Bashkin writes that &quot;a constant element that appears in most accounts of the Farhud is a narrative relating to a good neighbor [...] Judging by the lists of the Jewish dead, it seems that Jews in mixed neighborhoods stood a better chance of surviving the riots than those in uniformly Jewish areas.&quot; According to documents discovered from the Iraqi Jewish Archive, more than a thousand Jews were murdered or disappeared.

When the forces loyal to the regent entered to restore order, many rioters were killed. The Iraqi Commission Report noted that: &quot;After some delay the Regent... arranged for the dispatch of troops to take control... There was no more aimless firing into the air; their machine guns swept the streets clear of people and quickly put a stop to looting and rioting.&quot; The British Ambassador noted that the second day was more violent than the first, and that &quot;Iraqi troops killed as many rioters as the rioters killed Jews.&quot; The Iraqi Commission Report estimated the total number of Jews and Muslims killed at 130. Eliahu Eilat, a Jewish Agency agent estimated 1,000 as the total number of Jews and Muslims who died, with other similar accounts estimating 300–400 pogromists killed by the Regent&#x27;s army.

==Aftermath==
===Iraqi monarchist response===
Within a week of the riots, on 7 June, the reinstated monarchist Iraqi government set up a committee of inquiry to investigate the events. According to Peter Wien, the regime &quot;made every effort to present the followers of the Rashid &#x27;Ali movement as proxies of Nazism&quot;.

The monarchist government acted quickly to suppress supporters of Rashid Ali. Many Iraqis were exiled as a result, and hundreds were jailed. Military courts were convened to try the rioters and those responsible for the coup. A number of men, including Yunis al-Sabawi and multiple Iraqi Army officers and policemen, were legally sentenced to death in consequence of the violence by the newly established pro-British Iraqi government.

===Long-term impact===

In some accounts the &quot;Farhud&quot; marked the turning point for Iraq&#x27;s Jews. Other historians, however, see the pivotal moment for the Iraqi Jewish community much later, between 1948 and 1951, since Jewish communities prospered along with the rest of the country throughout most of the 1940s, and many Jews who left Iraq following the Farhud returned to the country shortly thereafter and permanent emigration did not accelerate significantly until 1950–1951. Bashkin writes that &quot;In the context of Jewish-Iraqi history, moreover, a distinction should be made between an analysis of the Farhud and the Farhudization of Jewish Iraqi historyviewing the Farhud as typifying the history of the relationship between Jews and greater Iraqi society. The Jewish community strived for integration in Iraq before and after the Farhud. In fact, the attachment of the community to Iraq was so tenacious that even after such a horrible event, most Jews continued to believe that Iraq was their homeland.&quot;

Either way, the Farhud is broadly understood to mark the start of a process of politicization of the Iraqi Jews in the 1940s, primarily amongst the younger population, especially as a result of the impact it had on hopes of long term integration into Iraqi society. In the direct aftermath of the Farhud, many joined the Iraqi Communist Party in order to protect the Jews of Baghdad, yet they did not want to leave the country and rather sought to fight for better conditions in Iraq itself. At the same time the Iraqi government which had taken over after the Farhud reassured the Iraqi Jewish community, and normal life soon returned to Baghdad, which saw a marked betterment of its economic situation during World WarII.

It was only after the Iraqi government initiated a policy shift towards the Iraqi Jews in 1948, curtailing their civil rights and firing many Jewish state employees, that the Farhud began to be regarded as more than just an outburst of violence instigated by foreign influences, namely Nazi propaganda.

On 23 October 1948, Shafiq Ades, a respected Jewish businessman, was publicly hanged in Basra on charges of selling weapons to Israel and the Iraqi Communist Party, despite the fact he was an outspoken anti-Zionist. The event increased the sense of insecurity among Jews. The Jewish community general sentiment was that if a man as well connected and powerful as Ades could be eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer, and the Farhud was no longer seen as an isolated incident. During this period, the Iraqi Jewish community became increasingly fearful.

===Remembrances===
A monument, called &quot;Prayer&quot;, located in Ramat Gan, is in memory of the Jews who were killed in Iraq during the Farhud and in the 1960s.

1 June 2015, was the first International Farhud Day at the United Nations.

<doc id="1079083" wikidata="Q3549765" url="?curid=1079083" title="Morgaine le Fey (DC Comics)">
<text>Morgaine le Fey is a supervillain appearing in DC Comics, based on Morgan le Fay, the mythical sorceress and half-sister of King Arthur. She debuted in &quot;The Demon&quot; #1 (September 1972), and was created by Jack Kirby.

==Fictional character biography==
Morgaine le Fey is the ancient sorceress of Arthurian legends. Her history is slightly different from the legends, but she is a sorceress gifted in the arts of black magic. In &quot;Madame Xanadu&quot; #1 (2008), Morgaine (or &quot;Morgana&quot;) is revealed as a sister of Nimue (the future Madame Xanadu) and Vivienne, the Lady of the Lake. All three descend from the &quot;Elder Folk&quot;, survivors of the fall of Atlantis that evolved into the &quot;Homo magi&quot;, explaining Morgaine&#x27;s affinity for magic. While Nimue is shown as kind and caring about the early, magic-free humans, Morgaine exhibits a mean streak, treating the new human breed as little more than playthings, using contempt even towards her kinder little sister.

After several centuries of manipulating humans and taking many lovers (including Julius Caesar), Morgaine sets her sights on Uther Pendragon, High King of Britain. Her advances are rejected, as Uther only has eyes for Igraine, the wife of Duke Gorlois of Cornwall. Seeking to meddle in their lives, Morgaine disguises herself as Igraine&#x27;s daughter. Afterward, she is exiled from the Elder Folk and travels to Avalon. In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Morgaine and Nimue are the biological daughters of Igraine, who is identified as a Fae.

In the early 6th century, Morgaine trains her sisters Morgause and Elaine to be adept with sorcery like her. After Uther kills Gorlois, Morgaine blames her half-brother King Arthur (Uther&#x27;s son) for stealing her and her sisters&#x27; birthright. She conspires against him throughout his time on the throne and seeks the destruction of Camelot. During this time, Merlin merges the demon Etrigan with the human Jason Blood in a last-ditch effort to defend the kingdom.

Following this, Morgaine continues to practice dark magic and retains her youth for many centuries, seeking power and a new kingdom to rule. By the 20th century, Merlin returns and tricks Morgaine, causing her to lose her youth.

In &quot;Batman Family&quot; #17, the Huntress&#x27;s use of the Justice League transporter frees Morgaine, who claims the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone. Le Fey seeks a baby with latent demon powers in the maternity ward where Man-Bat&#x27;s wife is giving birth. Several women give birth to demon children as a result. Etrigan also appears and together he and Man-Bat defeat le Fey.

Morgaine later attempts to steal Wonder Woman&#x27;s eternal youth, not realizing that she has given it up. She is killed, but revives and returns to battle Etrigan and Wonder Woman on many occasions.

Morgaine returns in &quot;Trinity&quot;, working with Enigma and Despero to usurp the symbolic position of Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. She infuses the villains with the Major Arcana of the Tarot, giving them a measure of control over reality. However, she is ultimately defeated and imprisoned in a stone idol, which is placed in Jason Blood&#x27;s custody.

Morgaine appears as a member of Hawkman and Hawkgirl&#x27;s group The Immortals, advising Kendra Saunders/Lady Blackhawk to use the Anti-Monitor&#x27;s brain to destroy the Dark Multiverse.

==Powers and abilities==
Morgaine le Fey is a sorceress skilled in the use of black magic. This gives her various abilities, including mind control, remote viewing, life force absorption, telepathy, and magic nullification.

<doc id="1079094" wikidata="Q4117101" url="?curid=1079094" title="City Council of Helsinki">
<text>The City Council of Helsinki ( , ) is the main decision-making organ in the local politics of Helsinki, Finland. The City Council deals with issues such as city planning, schools, health care, and public transport.

The 85-seat Council&#x27;s members are elected every four years in municipal elections. The seat of the Council is the Helsinki City Hall, which overlooks Market Square in central Helsinki. 
Historically, the center-right National Coalition Party has been the largest player in Helsinki&#x27;s local politics, with the center-left Social Democratic Party being the second largest. However, since the 2000 elections, the position of the Social Democrats has been challenged by the Green League, for which Helsinki is the strongest area of support nationally, with the former party becoming the second-largest in only the 2008 elections. As of 2021, the second-largest and third-largest parties in the Council are the Green League and the Social Democrats respectively.

The Left Alliance is the Council&#x27;s fourth-largest party while the Finns are the fifth-largest. The Swedish People&#x27;s Party is sixth, with the party&#x27;s support on a steady decline over the years; this can be attributed to the diminishing proportion of Swedish speakers in Helsinki. The agrarian Centre Party, despite being one of the major parties in national politics, has limited support in Helsinki. This is because there are very few farmers in Helsinki.

<text>USS &quot;Croaker&quot; (SS/SSK/AGSS/IXSS-246), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the croaker, any of various fishes which make throbbing or drumming noises.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Croaker&quot;′s keel was laid down on 1 April 1943 by Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 19 December 1943, sponsored by the wife of Admiral William H. P. Blandy, and commissioned on 21 April 1944, with Commander John E. Lee in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===

&quot;Croaker&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor from New London on 26 June 1944, and on 19 July put to sea on her first war patrol, sailing to the East China and Yellow Seas. In a series of brilliantly successful attacks which won her the Navy Unit Commendation, she sank the cruiser &quot;Nagara&quot; on 7 August, an auxiliary minesweeper, &quot;Taito Maru&quot;, on 16 August, and two freighters, &quot;Daigen Maru No. 7&quot; on 14 August and &quot;Yamateru Maru&quot; on 17 August. During this patrol, she served as lifeguard during air strikes on the Bonin Islands. She refitted at Midway Atoll from 31 August to 23 September, when she sailed in a coordinated attack group for the same area on her second war patrol. Again successful, she sank the freighters &quot;Shinki Maru&quot; on 9 October, and &quot;Hakuran Maru&quot; on 23 October. She shadowed a convoy on 23–24 October, sank the freighter &quot;Mikage Maru&quot;, and damaged &quot;Gassan Maru&quot; with her last torpedo. Tubes empty, she returned to Midway to fuel, and pushed on to Pearl Harbor, arriving for refit on 10 November.

&quot;Croaker&quot;″s third war patrol, in the Luzon Straits and South China Sea from 13 December 1944 to 12 February 1945, found her making no contacts with enemy shipping, but providing essential lifeguard service during strikes on Luzon preparatory to the invasion landings in Lingayen Gulf. She refitted at Fremantle, Australia, and on 12 March sailed for a patrol off the coast of Indo-China twice interrupted by the need to return to Australia for repairs. She refitted at Subic Bay, Philippines from 22 April to 15 May, then sailed for her fifth war patrol, in the Java Sea. On 30 May, she attacked a convoy of three small oilers guarded by an escort, with unconfirmed results, and on 5 June returned to Fremantle. Her final war patrol – from 1 July to 13 August – found her assigned to lifeguard duties in the South China Sea and off Hong Kong as the final series of air attacks on Japan were carried out.

Returning to Subic Bay, &quot;Croaker&quot; sailed for Saipan and continued on to Galveston, Tex., and New London, where she was then decommissioned and placed in reserve 15 May 1946 in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

===Post-War===

Recommissioned on 7 May 1951, she served as schoolship out of New London until 18 March 1953, when she was again decommissioned at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for conversion to a hunter-killer submarine. She was reclassified SSK-246 on 9 April 1953, and was recommissioned on 11 December 1953. Returning to active duty in February 1954, she operated along the East Coast and in the Caribbean, visiting ports in England while taking part in NATO exercises in 1957 and 1958.

&quot;Croaker&quot; was reclassified SS-246 again in August 1959. Special submarine exercises took her to England once more in February 1960, after which she resumed local operations out of New London. In September 1960, &quot;Croaker&quot; departed on a cruise which saw her sailing through the Mediterranean and Suez Canal to call at various Near Eastern ports and Karachi, Pakistan. She returned to New London in mid-December, retracing her outward track.

She was reclassified Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-246 in May 1967. Decommissioned for the last time on 2 April 1968, &quot;Croaker&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 20 December 1971 and reclassified Miscellaneous Unclassified Submarine IXSS-246 in December 1971. From 1977 to 1987, &quot;Croaker&quot; was displayed as a private attraction in Groton, Connecticut by the Submarine Memorial Association until the Navy revoked its agreement with the group citing a requirement for historical preservation of the vessel. Since 1988, &quot;Croaker&quot; has served as a museum ship at the Buffalo and Erie County Naval &amp; Military Park in Buffalo, New York.

==Awards==
*Navy Unit Commendation
*American Campaign Medal
*Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three battle stars
*World War II Victory Medal
*National Defense Service Medal with star

Along with the Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Croaker&quot; received three battle stars for those of her war patrols designated as &quot;successful&quot;: the first, second, and fifth of her six. She is credited with having sunk 19,710 tons of shipping.

&quot;Croaker&quot; was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on 12 September 2008.

<text>The [[Bishop]] of [[Northampton]] is the Ordinary of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Northampton in the Province of Westminster, England.

The see is in the town of Northampton where the bishop&#x27;s seat is located in the Cathedral Church of Our Lady and Saint Thomas of Canterbury.

The current bishop is the Right Reverend David Oakley, who was ordained bishop on 19 March 2020.

==History==
The Apostolic Vicariate of the Eastern District of England was created in 1840 out of the Midland District (which was renamed the Central District) and a couple of counties out of the London District. The Eastern District consisted of the counties of Cambridgeshire (with the Isle of Ely), Huntingdonshire, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Northamptonshire, Rutland, and Suffolk, all from the former Midland District, and the counties of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire from the London District.

On the restoration of the Catholic hierarchy in England and Wales by Pope Pius IX in 1850, most of the Eastern District became the Diocese of Northampton, with the Vicar Apostolic the Eastern District, William Wareing, appointed the first bishop of the diocese. The remainder of the Eastern District (Lincolnshire and Rutland) became part of the Diocese of Nottingham. Through the Local Government Act of 1972, a small area of Buckinghamshire became part of Berkshire, and Huntingdonshire and the Isle of Ely merged into Cambridgeshire. The Diocese of Northampton lost territory (Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk) on the creation of the Diocese of East Anglia in 1976.

<text>In physics, an open quantum system is a quantum-mechanical system that interacts with an external quantum system, which is known as the &quot;environment&quot; or a &quot;bath&quot;. In general, these interactions significantly change the dynamics of the system and result in quantum dissipation, such that the information contained in the system is lost to its environment. Because no quantum system is completely isolated from its surroundings, it is important to develop a theoretical framework for treating these interactions in order to obtain an accurate understanding of quantum systems.

Techniques developed in the context of open quantum systems have proven powerful in fields such as quantum optics, quantum measurement theory, quantum statistical mechanics, quantum information science, quantum thermodynamics, quantum cosmology, quantum biology, and semi-classical approximations.

==Quantum system and environment==

A complete description of a quantum system requires the inclusion of the environment. Completely describing the resulting combined system then requires the inclusion of its environment, which results in a new system that can only be completely described if its environment is included and so on. The eventual outcome of this process of embedding is the state of the whole universe described by a wavefunction formula_1. The fact that every quantum system has some degree of openness also means that no quantum system can ever be in a pure state.

Even if the combined system is in a pure state and can be described by a wavefunction formula_2, a subsystem in general cannot be described by a wavefunction. This observation motivated the formalism of density matrices, or density operators, introduced by John von Neumann in 1927 and independently, but less systematically by Lev Landau in 1927 and Felix Bloch in 1946. In general, the state of a subsystem is described by the density operator formula_3 and the expectation value of an observable formula_4 by the scalar product formula_5. There is no way to know if the combined system is pure from the knowledge of observables of the subsystem alone. In particular, if the combined system has quantum entanglement, the state of the subsystem is not pure.

== Dynamics ==
In general, the time evolution of closed quantum systems is described by unitary operators acting on the system. For open systems, however, the interactions between the system and its environment make it so that the dynamics of the system cannot be accurately described using unitary operators alone.

The time evolution of quantum systems can be determined by solving the effective equations of motion, also known as master equations, that govern how the density matrix describing the system changes over time and the dynamics of the observables that are associated with the system. In general, however, the environment that we want to model as being a part of our system is very large and complicated, which makes finding exact solutions to the master equations difficult, if not impossible. As such, the theory of open quantum systems seeks an economical treatment of the dynamics of the system and its observables. Typical observables of interest include things like energy and the robustness of quantum coherence (i.e. a measure of a state&#x27;s coherence). Loss of energy to the environment is termed quantum dissipation, while loss of coherence is termed quantum decoherence.

Due to the difficulty of determining the solutions to the master equations for a particular system and environment, a variety of techniques and approaches have been developed. A common objective is to derive a reduced description wherein the system&#x27;s dynamics are considered explicitly and the bath&#x27;s dynamics are described implicitly. The main assumption is that the entire system-environment combination is a large closed system. Therefore, its time evolution is governed by a unitary transformation generated by a global Hamiltonian. For the combined system bath scenario the global Hamiltonian can be decomposed into:

:formula_6

where formula_7 is the system&#x27;s Hamiltonian, formula_8 is the bath Hamiltonian and formula_9 is the system-bath interaction. The state of the system can then be obtained from a partial trace over the combined system and bath: formula_10.

Another common assumption that is used to make systems easier to solve is the assumption that the state of the system at the next moment depends only on the current state of the system. in other words, the system doesn&#x27;t have a memory of its previous states. Systems that have this property are known as Markovian systems. This approximation is justified when the system in question has enough time for the system to relax to equilibrium before being perturbed again by interactions with its environment. For systems that have very fast or very frequent perturbations from their coupling to their environment, this approximation becomes much less accurate.

=== Markovian equations ===
When the interaction between the system and the environment is weak, a time-dependent perturbation theory seems appropriate for treating the evolution of the system. In other words, if the interaction between the system and its environment is weak, then any changes to the combined system over time can be approximated as originating from only the system in question. Another typical assumption is that the system and bath are initially uncorrelated formula_11. This idea originated with Felix Bloch and was expanded upon by Alfred Redfield in his derivation of the Redfield equation. The Redfield equation is a Markovian master equation that describes the time evolution of the density matrix of the combined system. The drawback of the Redfield equation is that it does not conserve the positivity of the density operator.

A formal construction of a local equation of motion with a Markovian property is an alternative to a reduced derivation. The theory is based on an axiomatic approach. The basic starting point is a completely positive map. The assumption is that the initial system-environment state is uncorrelated formula_11 and the combined dynamics is generated by a unitary operator. Such a map falls under the category of Kraus operator. The most general type of a time-homogeneous master equation with the Markovian property describing non-unitary evolution of the density matrix ρ that is trace-preserving and completely positive for any initial condition is the Gorini–Kossakowski–Sudarshan–Lindblad equation or GKSL equation:
:formula_13

formula_14 is a (Hermitian) Hamiltonian part and formula_15:
:formula_16
is the dissipative part describing implicitly through system operators formula_17 the influence of the bath on the system.
The Markov property imposes that the system and bath are uncorrelated at all times formula_18.
The GKSL equation is unidirectional and leads any initial state formula_19 to a steady state solution which is an invariant of the equation of motion formula_20.
The family of maps generated by the GKSL equation forms a Quantum dynamical semigroup. In some fields, such as quantum optics, the term Lindblad superoperator is often used to express the quantum master equation for a dissipative system. E.B. Davis derived the GKSL with Markovian property master equations using perturbation theory and additional approximations, such as the rotating wave or secular, thus fixing the flaws of the Redfield equation. Davis construction is consistent with the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger stability criterion for thermal equilibrium i.e. the KMS state. An alternative approach to fix the Redfield has been proposed by J. Thingna, J.-S. Wang, and P. Hänggi that allows for system-bath interaction to play a role in equilibrium differing from the KMS state.

In 1981, Amir Caldeira and Anthony J. Leggett proposed a simplifying assumption in which the bath is decomposed to normal modes represented as harmonic oscillators linearly coupled to the system. As a result, the influence of the bath can be summarized by the bath spectral function. This method is known as the Caldeira–Leggett model, or harmonic bath model. To proceed and obtain explicit solutions, the path integral formulation description of quantum mechanics is typically employed. A large part of the power behind this method is the fact that harmonic oscillators are relatively well-understood compared to the true coupling that exists between the system and the bath. Unfortunately, while the Caldeira-Leggett model is one that leads to a physically consistent picture of quantum dissipation, its ergodic properties are too weak and so the dynamics of the model do not generate wide-scale quantum entanglement between the bath modes.

An alternative bath model is a spin bath. At low temperatures and weak system-bath coupling, the Caldeira-Leggett and spin bath models are equivalent. But for higher temperatures or strong system-bath coupling, the spin bath model has strong ergodic properties. Once the system is coupled, significant entanglement is generated between all modes. In other words, the spin bath model can simulate the Caldeira-Leggett model, but the opposite is not true.

An example of natural system being coupled to a spin bath is a nitrogen-vacancy (N-V) center in diamonds. In this example, the color center is the system and the bath consists of carbon-13 (13C) impurities which interact with the system via the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction.

For open quantum systems where the bath has oscillations that are particularly fast, it is possible to average them out by looking at sufficiently large changes in time. This is possible because the average amplitude of fast oscillations over a large time scale is equal to the central value, which can always be chosen to be zero with a minor shift along the vertical axis. This method of simplifying problems is known as the secular approximation.

=== Non-Markovian equations ===
Open quantum systems that do not have the Markovian property are generally much more difficult to solve. This is largely due to the fact that the next state of a non-Markovian system is determined by each of its previous states, which rapidly increases the memory requirements to compute the evolution of the system. Currently, the methods of treating these systems employ what are known as projection operator techniques. These techniques employ a projection operator formula_21, which effectively applies the trace over the environment as described previously. The result of applying formula_21 to formula_23(i.e. calculating formula_24) is called the &quot;relevant part&quot; of formula_23. For completeness, another operator formula_26 is defined so that formula_27 where formula_28 is the identity matrix. The result of applying formula_26 to formula_23(i.e. calculating formula_31) is called the &quot;irrelevant part&quot; of formula_23. The primary goal of these methods is to then derive a master equation that defines the evolution of formula_24.

One such derivation using the projection operator technique results in what is known as the Nakajima–Zwanzig equation. This derivation highlights the problem of the reduced dynamics being non-local in time:

: formula_34

Here the effect of the bath throughout the time evolution of the system is hidden in the memory kernel formula_35. While the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation is an exact equation that holds for almost all open quantum systems and environments, it can be very difficult to solve. This means that approximations generally need to be introduced to reduce the complexity of the problem into something more manageable. As an example, the assumption of a fast bath is required to lead to a time local equation: formula_36. Other examples of valid approximations include the weak-coupling approximation and the single-coupling approximation.

In some cases, the projection operator technique can be used to reduce the dependence of the system&#x27;s next state on all of its previous states. This method of approaching open quantum systems is known as the time-convolutionless projection operator technique, and it is used to generate master equations that are inherently local in time. Because these equations can neglect more of the history of the system, they are often easier to solve than things like the Nakajima-Zwanzig equation.

Another approach emerges as an analogue of classical dissipation theory developed by Ryogo Kubo and Y. Tanimura. This approach is connected to hierarchical equations of motion which embed the density operator in a larger space of auxiliary operators such that a time local equation is obtained for the whole set and their memory is contained in the auxiliary operators.

<text>I Never Told Anyone: Writings by Women Survivors of Child Sex Abuse is a 1983 book edited by Ellen Bass and Louise Thornton and marked Bass&#x27;s first published non-fiction work. It was published by Harper and Row and contains a collection of numerous child sexual abuse testimonials from a wide range of original source material including book excerpts, poems, and essays. The work was republished in 1991 through Harper Perennial and included a new afterword by Bass.

The book&#x27;s title is a reference to some abuse survivors stating that they had never told anyone about their abuse due to various reasons such as threats of harm or that they did not think that they would be believed.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;I Never Told Anyone&quot; contains 33 testimonials from women who were sexually abused as children. The book begins with a set of statistics about childhood sexual abuse such as information about the sex of the abuse survivors and perpetrators. The testimonials are placed into the categories of abuse by fathers, relatives, friends and acquaintances, and strangers, each section of which is prefaced by a section discussing the specific category. In the work Bass also details her own experiences and feelings towards female sexuality in the United States.

== Development ==
The idea for the collection came from a writing workshop that Bass held in Santa Cruz, entitled &quot;I Never Told Anyone&quot;. Bass, who had held writing workshops in the past, had been approached by a Boston area activist named Leslie who felt that the workshop, especially the act of publicizing its existence, would help serve to raise awareness and create social change. During the workshop Bass found that the issue of sexual abuse &quot;hit a common frayed nerve among workshop participants&quot;, many of whom agreed to help with the collection. In publishing the collection Bass and Thornton hoped that it would show that there was therapeutic value in the survivors writing about their abuse and that the work&#x27;s publication would help give them a voice.

== Reception ==
&quot;Psychology in the Schools&quot; reviewed the work positively in 1985, stating that it would have a &quot;most definite place&quot; in psychology literature. The journal &quot;Family Systems Medicine&quot; also reviewed &quot;I Never Told Anyone&quot;, which they felt was &quot;excellent reading for practitioners involved in treating families, as it illuminates the many varieties of possible child sexual abuse.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; was more critical, writing &quot;For the women, telling has been cathartic, and others in their situation may experience a similar release. Those involved with children, however, will gain a better understanding of the problem from Robert Geiser&#x27;s &quot;Hidden Victims&quot; (1979) and specific guidance from Linda Sanford&#x27;s &quot;Silent Children&quot; (1980).&quot;

&quot;I Never Told Anyone&quot; was criticized in the 1996 book &quot;Worlds of Hurt: Reading the Literatures of Trauma&quot;, where it was noted that it &quot;frequently compromises the integrity of the personal narratives, reducing and softening their impact on the reader, while at the same time creating the impression that, within each category, all incest experiences are somehow alike. The latter is accomplished, like an uncomfortable fit in a glass slipper, but a little judicious toe and heel trimming.&quot; The book also noted that the framework used by Bass and Thornton for &quot;I Never Told Anyone&quot; classified abused women as within the framework of mental illness and that &quot;By making it clear that child sexual abuse had dramatic effects upon its victims, and by advocating that women seek counseling, advice, and support from professionals and therapy groups, Bass and Thornton create the impression that the survivors are weak, harmless and &quot;sick&quot; - no threat to the status quo.&quot;

<text>The ABA digital signature guidelines are a set of guidelines published on 1 August 1996 by the American Bar Association (ABA) Section of Science and Technology Law. The authors are members of the Section&#x27;s Information Security Committee. The document was the first overview of principles and a framework for the use of digital signatures and authentication in electronic commerce from a legal viewpoint, including technologies such as certificate authorities and public key infrastructure (PKI). The guidelines were a product of a four-year collaboration by 70 lawyers and technical experts from a dozen countries, and have been adopted as the model for legislation by some states in the US, including Florida and Utah.

The Digital Signature Guidelines were followed by the Public Key Infrastructure Assessment Guidelines published by the ABA in 2003.

A similar effort was undertaken in Slovenia by the Digital Signature Working Group (within the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (CCIS)).

<doc id="1079111" wikidata="Q370784" url="?curid=1079111" title="Atlantic 252">
<text>Atlantic 252 was an Irish longwave radio station broadcasting to Ireland and the United Kingdom on 252 kHz (1190 metres) from its 1988 purpose-built transmission site at Clarkstown radio transmitter, County Meath, which provided service to Atlantic 252 from 1989 until 2002. The station&#x27;s studios were located 12 km (7 mi) away in Mornington House, Summerhill Road, Trim, County Meath. Atlantic 252 also had sales offices and studios at 74 Newman Street in London.

== Early history ==

The concept of Atlantic 252 can be traced to as far back as August 1986, when Irish state broadcaster RTÉ announced it was to use its allocated longwave frequency for a new pop music station. Ireland (and RTE) had been allocated a long wave frequency at the Regional Administrative Broadcasting Conference in Geneva in 1975. RTÉ teamed up with RTL Group / Radio Luxembourg to form Radio Tara – the trading name of Atlantic 252 – which, being on long wave, was able to provide reception across Ireland and the United Kingdom. The Irish Government allowed RTE to allocate the 252 licence to Radio Tara. The broadcaster Pat Kenny, who was a member of the RTE Board was Chairman of Radio Tara (Atlantic 252) between 1990 - 1992. This followed Chris Cary&#x27;s pirate Radio XIDY test transmissions on 254 kHz longwave in the mid-1980s.

The Radio Tara company was officially registered in 1985, with trading names of Radio Tara, Atlantic 252 and Tara 254, it was dissolved in 2011.

In 1987, RTÉ commenced building a giant three-sided 248-metre broadcast mast in Clarkstown, County Meath, using a specially built pair of air- and water-cooled 300 kW solid-state transmitters (which could be combined to give double power) built by Varian Associates, Texas, despite protests from local residents. Studios were set up in Mornington House, in the nearby town of Trim. The station cost £6 million to set up. Just over 47 million people were in the station&#x27;s broadcast area.

At 8.00 local time (7.00 GMT) on the morning of 1 September 1989 Gary King announced on Atlantic 252, &quot;Mine is the first voice you will ever hear on Atlantic 252&quot;. This was followed by a specially produced pre-recorded introduction tape that introduced everybody employed by the radio station on its launch day, from engineers, administration, management like Travis Baxter and John Catlett, and the station&#x27;s personality music presenter line-up, including ex-Laser 558 presenter Charlie Wolf, Henry Owens, Mary Ellen O&#x27;Brien, Dusty Rhodes, Al Dunne, Tony West, Jeff Graham and the station&#x27;s newsreader Andrew Turner. An appearance was even made by Rosalyn Reilly, who was to remain the station&#x27;s cleaning lady for its entire twelve-year history.

The station&#x27;s official &quot;first record ever played&quot; – on the launch date of 1 September 1989 – was &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love&quot; by Tears for Fears, followed by &quot;Monkey&quot; by George Michael. The first record played during the period of Atlantic 252&#x27;s test transmissions had been &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nobody&quot; by Rufus and Chaka Khan (&#x27;89 Remix).

Although the transmitter was in Ireland, the signal&#x27;s reach meant that it was often looked upon as a &quot;UK national station&quot;. Reception reports were received from such locations as Berlin, Finland, Ibiza and Moscow. The signal had even been received in Brazil at night-time. The Scottish musician Mylo has claimed that it was the only station with listenable reception on the Isle of Skye. At launch there were no UK-wide commercial stations (the first would be Classic FM in 1992), and the lack of a UK broadcast licence attracted the attention of the IBA. Although the transmitters were theoretically capable of being combined to operate at a radiated power of 600 kW, international agreements limited it to a daytime maximum 500 kW, and just 100 kW during the hours of darkness.

==Mid-1990s peak==
Initially, the station transmitted only from 6a.m. until 7p.m., outside of which listeners were invited to tune to Radio Luxembourg. In August 1990, the station extended its broadcasting hours to 2a.m. with post-midnight output being automated under the branding of &quot;The Big Mattress&quot;. In September 1991, Atlantic 252 began broadcasting a 24-hour service, although until the middle of the decade, overnight programming continued to be automated.

The music format consisted of high-rotation mainstream pop and rock music, with influences borrowed heavily from American radio, and through to 1993, a lot of the station&#x27;s music was drawn from the top part of the US charts. The station mixed the best songs from the last few years along with the best songs from the top 40 – this was called &quot;Today&#x27;s Best Music Variety&quot;. News summaries were broadcast at 10 to and 20 past the hour during the breakfast show and during part of the drivetine show. Commercial Radio and the BBC initially objected to the station, seeing it as a commercial pirate. However, as UK commercial radio developed and deregulation saw many more stations launching, formats similar to Atlantic&#x27;s began to appear on FM and Atlantic 252&#x27;s audience began to decline. Attempts at repositioning followed, including &quot;Real Music, Real Radio&quot;, when the station attempted to tackle BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &quot;new music&quot; format. At the peak of its popularity in 1993, Atlantic 252 had six million listeners aged 15+ in the UK and Ireland, but vastly increased competition from local radio stations with similar formats saw this decline yearly.

==Relaunch attempts==
In late 1998, under the direction of David Dunne, the station responded to dropping audiences by shifting its format to concentrate on indie and dance music, but it continued to lose listeners. This included 30 hours of &quot;specialist&quot; music, including programmes from The Wise Guys, Eddy Temple Morris and the Trade nightclub. Money was spent on advertising and a high-profile breakfast show was attempted fronted by Marc Brow (including several innovative ideas like travel news backed by new age chill out music called &#x27;Traffic Calming&#x27;, and specially re-formatted youth news presented by Specialist Producer Mark Ovenden which included one of the first broadcast uses of the term &#x27;The Noughties&#x27;), in 1999 the station suffered its lowest Rajar ratings since it first came on the air, with the audience falling to just under one million UK listeners in the last quarter of the year.

In November 1999, with the arrival of John O&#x27;Hara as the new managing director, the station re-launched in February 2000 as &quot;The New Atlantic 252&quot;. The format was changed to urban contemporary music (such as garage, house, hip hop and R&amp;B) and the station was rebranded with the slogan &quot;Non-stop Rhythm and Dance&quot;. There was over £1million spent on rebranding and marketing the station to a new audience and media buyers, including a new website. Under the new format RAJAR ratings rose once more above the one million mark, the station had a better market value, and the sale of the station was announced in early 2001 by its owners RTÉ and CLT.

==Last broadcast==
The last show on Atlantic was presented by Enda Caldwell on 20 December 2001. This was followed by a tribute show produced by Enda Caldwell and Eric Murphy celebrating the station&#x27;s twelve-year history of broadcasting and featuring classic airchecks of each year of Atlantic 252&#x27;s history. The station then transitioned to automation, and continued broadcasting music without continuity, along with pre-booked commercials, until midnight on 2 January 2002, when transmissions ceased.

==Notable DJs==
Many of the original presenters line-up came from Laser 558/UK Commercial Radio and BBC Radio 1, and the Irish presenters came from Dublin superpirates such as Sunshine 101 and SuperQ 102. During the early years the presenters used nicknames, an idea originated in the US at stations like WHTZ FM Z100. Notable presenters included:

* Bam Bam
* Robin Banks
* David Dunne
* Rick O&#x27;Shea
* Eddy Temple-Morris
* Charlie Wolf
* Tony Wrighton

==Post-closure==
===Teamtalk 252===
Atlantic 252 was briefly replaced by a sports station TEAMtalk 252, which opened in the early days of January 2002. This faced competition from BBC Radio 5 Live and talkSPORT, and was itself closed in the summer of 2002, just a few months after its launch.

===RTE&#x27;s use of the frequency===
From 2004, the frequency was used by RTÉ to provide a version of RTÉ Radio 1 to the expatriate community in Britain.

(DRM) tests have also been heard on this frequency since 2007.

In 2008, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on MW and the opt-outs, mostly for weekend sports coverage and for religious programming, were transferred to 252 long wave. It also meant that listeners in Northern Ireland, who had previously relied on the MW transmission, were still able to hear Radio 1.

The LW service was due to be withdrawn in 2014 but this was postponed several times and long wave transmissions continued until Friday night into Saturday morning of 14/15 April 2023. The daily cost of transmission was the primary reason for ending the service.

The transmitter mast was demolished on 27 July 2023, three months after it had fallen silent for the final time.

Mornington House is now used as regional offices for Meath County Council.

=== UK DAB station ===
In June 2024, a new station using the Atlantic 252 name and playing similar music to the original 1990s station launched on a number of DAB digital radio multiplexes in North West England.
