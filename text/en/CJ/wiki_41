<text>Northern Lights Festival Boréal is an annual summer music festival in Sudbury, Ontario. It is one of Canada&#x27;s oldest continuous music festivals, having been staged every year since 1972 until the COVID-19 pandemic.

The bilingual festival is held on the shores of Ramsey Lake at Bell Park, home of the Grace Hartman Amphitheatre. A diverse program of music is presented in a variety of genres including arts, crafts and children&#x27;s entertainment, featuring a mix of national, international and Northern Ontario artists and performers. Musicians at the festival typically participate in concert performances and workshop sessions, collaborating with several other musicians.

In addition to the main festival, the organizing committee also sponsors concerts and other cultural events in the city throughout the year.

The festival is normally held on the first weekend in July. Most commonly held over three days from Friday to Sunday, the festival at various times in its history has also taken place over one, two or four days.

==History==
Founded by a group of volunteers in 1972, the festival incorporated in 1975 at which time artists also began to be paid for performing. The event has always been multicultural, including Ukrainian, Indian, and Croatian Canadians at the first festival, and Indigenous artists since the third. 

Some of the highlights over the years: 

* In the 1970s, Colin Linden, then 14 years old, appeared at the festival.
* Canadian folk musician Stan Rogers wrote one of his most famous songs, &quot;Barrett&#x27;s Privateers&quot;, while at the festival. The song was written for a collaborative performance session with the band Friends of Fiddler&#x27;s Green.
* In the 1980s, the festival was one of the first major venues to book Shania Twain, then 10 years old.
* The 1990 event saw the first collaborative performance by folk musicians James Keelaghan and Oscar Lopez, who later recorded two Juno Award-nominated albums together as the &quot;Compadres&quot;.
* In 1992, the festival was profiled in the TVOntario series &quot;Putting On the Arts&quot;.
* In 1999, pop singer Amanda Marshall announced a concert in the city on a date that conflicted with the festival. The controversy was resolved when Marshall&#x27;s promoters offered a special promotional pass that enabled ticketholders to attend both events. Nevertheless, attendance at the festival fell below expectations, leaving a deficit. The following year, the festival recovered by offering a smaller program.
* In 2017, the festival expanded its three-day schedule with a Thursday night performance devoted exclusively to Indigenous music.
* In 2020 and 2021, the festival was cancelled for the first time in its history due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.
* The festival celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2022.

Festival artistic directors have included Scott Merrifield, Vickie McGauley, John Closs, Claude Faucon, Paul Loewenberg, and Max Merrifield.

==Awards==
The Jackie Washington Award is presented each year for distinguished contribution to Northern Ontario&#x27;s cultural life. Past recipients have included Robert Paquette, Ken Whiteley, Daniel Bédard, Paul Dunn and Charlie Angus. The winner of the award in 2024 was Iona Reed and Ron Kelly. The award is named for Jackie Washington, a blues musician who appeared at the festival 25 times between the festival&#x27;s inauguration in 1972 and Washington&#x27;s death in 2009.

The Bernie Melanson Volunteer Award is also awarded annually, named after one of the festival&#x27;s founding members and given to individuals or groups for longstanding or exceptional service to the festival.

<doc id="1093689" wikidata="Q3735578" url="?curid=1093689" title="Everything Sucks (Descendents album)">
<text>Everything Sucks is the fifth studio album by American punk rock band Descendents, released on September 24, 1996, through Epitaph Records. It was their first album of new studio material since 1987&#x27;s &quot;All&quot;, after which singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members (bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson) had changed the band&#x27;s name to All and released eight albums between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. When Aukerman decided to return to music the group chose to operate as two acts simultaneously, playing with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All. It is considered a return to the band&#x27;s angrier hardcore punk such as the &quot;Fat&quot; EP and &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;.

&quot;Everything Sucks&quot; was the first Descendents release to chart, reaching No. 132 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 4 on Top Heatseekers, supported by the singles &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; and &quot;When I Get Old&quot;. Aukerman returned to his biochemistry career following the album&#x27;s supporting tours, reuniting with them again in 2004 for &quot;Cool to Be You&quot;, and again in 2010 for live performances.

== Background ==
The Descendents formed in 1978 in Manhattan Beach, California, with an initial recording lineup of Tony Lombardo (bass guitar), Frank Navetta (guitar), and Bill Stevenson (drums). Adding singer Milo Aukerman in 1980, the band released three albums over the next six years, weathering several lineup changes (Navetta left the band in 1983 and was replaced by Ray Cooper, and Lombardo left in 1985 and was replaced by Doug Carrion) and a hiatus from 1983 to 1985 while Aukerman attended college and Stevenson joined Black Flag. By September 1986 Aukerman and Stevenson were the only remaining members, and recruited bassist Karl Alvarez and guitarist Stephen Egerton from Salt Lake City to continue the band. This Descendents lineup recorded &quot;All&quot; in 1987, an album themed around the concept of &quot;All&quot; invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion in 1980. When Aukerman left the band later that year to pursue a career in biochemistry, Alvarez, Egerton, and Stevenson changed the band&#x27;s name to All and continued with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. Stevenson stated at the time that he wished to preserve the Descendents as his and Aukerman&#x27;s project:
Milo has stuck with me for almost nine years now, so I wouldn&#x27;t exactly feel right about just continuing to call us the Descendents. In a sense that would be kind of like discrediting Milo&#x27;s nine years worth of effort. It&#x27;s kind of like, &quot;Let the Descendents be my and Milo&#x27;s sacred thing,&quot; or whatever. Who knows, at some point later on we might decide that we want to get together and record something.
Aukerman occasionally collaborated with All, writing &quot;Just Like Them&quot; for the album &quot;Allroy Saves&quot; (1990) and singing backing vocals on &quot;Breaking Things&quot; (1993), as well as filling in at occasional performances when Price would lose his voice. Lombardo also collaborated with All for the 1991 album &quot;New Girl, Old Story&quot;.

In 1995 Aukerman expressed a desire to return to recording and performing, so the band members decided to work with him as the Descendents while continuing to work with Price as All, in order to &quot;make room for Milo without pushing Chad out.&quot; Stevenson explained that the arrangement did not cause any resentment between the two singers: &quot;[I]t&#x27;s all totally good, it&#x27;s just that when we are playing, Milo couldn&#x27;t be All&#x27;s singer, cause Chad is All&#x27;s singer. So, we decided that we could be Descendents with Milo, and All with Chad. It&#x27;s not really a reunion, we&#x27;ve been together the whole time.&quot; Aukerman described his decision to rejoin the band as &quot;really just my re-entry into the song writing, I had been away for so long and I just wanted to make music which is what I love to do.&quot;

&quot;Everything Sucks&quot; was recorded in June and July 1996 at The Blasting Room, a studio built and run by Stevenson in Fort Collins, Colorado. Original Descendents members Tony Lombardo and Frank Navetta made appearances on the album: Navetta wrote the song &quot;Doghouse&quot; and both he and Lombardo played on it, marking the first recording by the original Descendents lineup of Aukerman, Lombardo, Navetta, and Stevenson since &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot; in 1982. Navetta also played on &quot;Eunuch Boy&quot;, a song Aukerman and Lombardo had written fifteen years earlier. According to Aukerman: Eunuch Boy&#x27; is the first song I ever wrote, really. When we formed, Tony Lombardo, the original bass player said, &#x27;Dude, you need to write some songs&#x27;, and I had never written a song before so I just wrote down some words and brought it to him. He made the music for it.&quot; Lombardo also wrote and played on &quot;Gotta&quot;, which was left off of the album but released as a B-side on the &quot;When I Get Old&quot; single. Chad Price sang backing vocals on the album, while Stevenson and Egerton produced and engineered it.

All had previously been signed to major label Interscope Records for 1995&#x27;s &quot;Pummel&quot;, but were dissatisfied with the experience. Both All and the Descendents signed to Epitaph Records, who released &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, the subsequent All albums &quot;Mass Nerder&quot; (1998) and &quot;Problematic&quot; (2000), and the All/Descendents double live album &quot;Live Plus One&quot; (2001). It was rumored that Epitaph would not sign All without getting the Descendents as well, but Stevenson explained that the arrangement was made because Epitaph head Brett Gurewitz would allow both bands to make albums at their discretion:
When we signed with Epitaph it was for both bands. It was a thing of knowing Brett forever, and so I just sat down and said, &quot;Well, we want to make records!&quot; At the time we were leaving Interscope. We weren&#x27;t happy with Interscope at all. So we sat down and told them we wanted to make both All and Descendents records whenever we want, at our choosing. Brett and I worked out a deal like that, so it was really flexible and we could basically do whatever we wanted.
The Descendents supported &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; with a series of tours from September 1996 to August 1997 covering the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Europe, touring with Swingin&#x27; Utters, The Bouncing Souls, The Suicide Machines, Shades Apart, Guttermouth, Less Than Jake, Handsome, Electric Frankenstein, Social Distortion, Pennywise, H2O, and others. Music videos were filmed for &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot; and &quot;When I Get Old&quot;, and both songs were released as singles in Europe.

&quot;Everything Sucks&quot; became the first Descendents release to chart, reaching No. 132 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 4 on Top Heatseekers. Ned Raggett of AllMusic remarked: &quot;take this out of its surrounding context and this was and is a prime Descendents album. All the humor and heart-on-sleeve showcasing one could hope for are here [...] anyone dismissing this as just like any other pop-punk around misses the point that these characters helped found it as much as anyone!&quot; Rock critic Robert Christgau, however, merely gave the album a &quot;neither&quot; rating, indicating it as neither impressive nor a dud, which &quot;may impress once or twice with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won&#x27;t.&quot; In a 2004 biography of the band, Jenny Eliscu, of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called their reunion &quot;unforgivable&quot; and stated that &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; &quot;lived up to its name.&quot;

<doc id="1093695" wikidata="Q2622596" url="?curid=1093695" title="Raich Carter">
<text>Horatio Stratton &quot;Raich&quot; Carter (21 December 1913 – 9 October 1994) was an English sportsman who played football for Sunderland, Derby County and Hull City, as well as representing England on thirteen occasions. He also played first-class cricket for Derbyshire in 1946. He later became a football manager.

In 2013 he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame.

==Background==
Carter was born at Hendon, Sunderland, the son of Robert Carter who played football for Port Vale, Fulham and Southampton. His Christian names come from his maternal grandfather and mother&#x27;s maiden name respectively. He had an elder brother who died as a baby and 2 sisters.

As a boy, Carter attended Hendon Board School. He excelled at most sports, including football, cricket and athletics. According to family legend, at the age of 3, Raich was promised a trial with Leicester City when he reached 17 by their scout George Metcalfe, a former South Shields player.

On 23 April 1927, he made his England Schoolboy debut, scoring once in the 6–1 win over Wales at Eastville Stadium, home of Bristol Rovers. He retained his place in the side for both games during the following season, captaining the side (and scoring twice) on his final appearance, a 3–2 win over Wales in Swansea.

On leaving school in summer 1928, Carter was presented with a gold watch inscribed with details of his England football and school cricket achievements. He was offered amateur terms and an office job by Sunderland. His uncle Ted, who had been acting as his guardian since his father&#x27;s death in March 1928, was not impressed and insisted he learn a trade to fall back on and also noted Carter was still too small and light for professional football. Carter was apprenticed as an electrician with the Sunderland Forge and Mechanical Company. He played football for their works team and also Whitburn St Mary&#x27;s whose team contained many of Sunderland&#x27;s best juniors.

On his 17th birthday, Carter reminded neighbour George Metcalfe of his long standing promise. When Leicester City visited Sunderland a few days later, Metcalfe arranged a trial for Carter with them. On 27 December 1931 on a heavy pitch, Carter did not impress and was told by the Leicester City manager Willie Orr that he was too small.

== Football career ==
In the summer of 1931 Carter signed amateur terms with Sunderland. After a trial he was still considered too small to be a professional. He moved to leading local amateur side Esh Winning. On 10 October 1931 Carter made his debut for Sunderland reserves against Walker Celtic He retained his place a week later. On 12 November 1931, he signed a professional contract. It was a part-time contract (training 2 nights a week) for £3 a week plus £1 for each reserve team appearance. A big increase on his 45p a week electrician&#x27;s apprenticeship. After 9 appearances, his wage was increased to £8 a week.

Carter captained Sunderland to the Football League title in 1936, at that time the youngest man ever to have captained a First Division title-winning side. On 28 March 1936, Carter was sent off for the only time in his career in a feisty 5–0 defeat at Middlesbrough. In December 1936 Carter received the usual benefit cheque of £650 for 5 years&#x27; service with the club. It was to rankle him that despite a long career it was the only benefit cheque he was to receive as he never did 5 years continuous service again. He followed that up with victory in the 1937 FA Cup final, scoring the second Sunderland goal in a 3–1 win over Preston North End.

The Second World War left him bereft of many of his peak years, like many great players of his age. Afterwards he picked up another Cup winners medal with Derby in 1946, becoming the only player to win Cup winners medals both before and after the war.

In November 1945 Carter was transfer listed by Sunderland after the club refused his request for a new 10-year contract. A number of clubs expressed an interest. On 21 December 1945 Carter joined Derby County for £6,000 minutes before the FA Cup transfer deadline. On 31 August 1946, Carter made his Football League debut for Derby at Sunderland. He later played for Hull City and Cork Athletic.

In February 1953, Carter signed a short term playing contract with Cork Athletic. The terms were £50 per match plus expenses compared to the £14 maximum wage in England. He was able to live in Hull and fly to Ireland every weekend for matches. He scored twice on his debut on 8 February 1953 against Waterford and helped his new club to do the cup double winning the FAI Cup and Munster Senior Cup. Whilst with Cork Athletic, he was selected to play for the League of Ireland against the English Football League.

Carter was also capped 13 times for England as an inside forward. On 14 April 1934 he made his international debut against Scotland at Wembley Stadium. Carter gained his last cap on 18 May 1947 in a 1–0 defeat against Switzerland in Zürich&#x27;s Hardturm Stadium. He also won 17 wartime international caps and played for the RAF and Combined Services.

Amongst his many admirers was the great Stanley Matthews, who said about him &quot;I felt [he] was the ideal partner for me... Carter was a supreme entertainer who dodged, dribbled, twisted and turned, sending bewildered left-halves madly along false trails. Inside the penalty box with the ball at his feet and two or three defenders snapping at his ankles, he&#x27;d find the space to get a shot in at goal... Bewilderingly clever, constructive, lethal in front of goal, yet unselfish. Time and again he&#x27;d play the ball out wide to me and with such service I was in my element.&quot;

On 20 April 1937, he sat for Madame Tussauds. On 20 September 1952 the first issue of the weekly nationwide magazine &quot;Raich Carter&#x27;s Soccer Star&quot; appeared, his name was dropped from the title in 1955 and the magazine was incorporated into World Soccer in 1970.

== Second World War ==
Carter joined the Auxiliary Fire Brigade and on 19 March 1940 was asked to join the Fire Service. Neither appointment was universally well received as some perceived it as a way of avoiding National Service and others suggested favouritism when he was the only man appointed to the Fire Service from 240 applicants. On 2 October 1941, Carter joined the RAF. He worked as a Physical Training Instructor and after several postings he was posted to the Loughborough Rehabilitation Centre, where Dan Maskell was his Squadron Leader, helping airmen, many in plaster casts, recover their fitness and general health.

Carter played 17 war time internationals as well as other representative games for the RAF and Combined Services. He guested for Huddersfield Town, Hartlepools United, York City, Derby County and Nottingham Forest.

==Cricket career==

Schoolboy ideas of a dual football-cricket career were discounted as Carter felt he would be unable to give his full attention to two sports and that cricket would probably involve moving away from home and his widowed mother and sisters and serving a residential qualification before being eligible to play for a first-class county.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dual football / cricket career&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1933 he made his debut in the Second Eleven Championship for Durham County Cricket Club against Yorkshire&#x27;s Second XI at Headingley. Batting at number 10, he top scored with 44 runs in a total of 145 and retained his place in the next game when Durham beat the touring West Indies at Ashbrooke, Sunderland, although he was dismissed for a duck. In July 1934, he was again selected to play for Durham against Yorkshire&#x27;s 2nd XI; he took 4/22 and scored 10 runs and retained his place in the side for the next game against the touring Australians side.

Whilst at Derby, Carter played first-class cricket for Derbyshire County Cricket Club. He made his County Championship debut in June 1946 against Worcestershire. He was a right-handed batsman and batted in four innings in his three first-class matches. He was a left-arm slow orthodox bowler and took two wickets.

During the summer, Carter was a regular club cricketer playing mainly in the Durham Senior League for Hendon and Sunderland Police. In the summer of 1936, due to loyalty to Hendon, he rejected interest from several clubs who wanted to employ him as their cricket professional. After moving to Derby, he played for Chaddesden. He was a regular for the cricket teams of Derby County and Hull City.

Carter kept some of his England shirts, removed the badge pocket, and used them for cricket.

A big hitter, Carter was known as the &quot;Gilbert Jessop of Durham&quot;.

== Managerial career ==
In February 1948, rumours began to circulate that Carter was to move to Leeds United. Carter was interviewed for the position but there were two stumbling blocks, the length of the contract and Leeds&#x27; wish to make the appointment at the end of the season. On 1 April 1948, Carter joined Hull City in a player / assistant manager role for £6,000. He turned down other offers believing he would learn more under manager Major Frank Buckley and Hull City would provide the fastest route into a manager&#x27;s position. He was appointed player – manager on 23 April 1948 after Buckley&#x27;s resignation. Carter continued his playing career at Hull City, winning the Division Three North title and reaching the Round 6 of the FA Cup in his first season and buying a young Don Revie. In the next 2 seasons, the side finished 7th and 10th in Division Two. On 5 September 1951, Carter offered his resignation. It was accepted by the directors on 12 September 1951, no reason was given and no discord was apparent. Several clubs expressed an interest in signing him but he continued to train with Hull City, who retained his playing contract, until the directors asked him not to. He maintained his match fitness by playing local amateur football in Leconfield. Following strong public support, although not all the directors were not supportive, he returned as a player with Hull City on 8 December 1951 for the rest of that season before retiring as a player.

In May 1953, Carter was appointed Leeds United manager; he stated he was joining as manager only, although he did play in several friendly games. In his first two seasons, they finished 10th and 4th in Division 2. In May 1955, Carter turned down an offer to return to Derby County as manager. He was rewarded with a new 3-year contract to replace the 2 one year contracts he&#x27;d previously had. In 1956, Leeds United finished runners-up and were promoted to Division 1 after a nine-year absence. The following season, they finished 8th in the top flight with John Charles scoring 38 goals. He left for Juventus FC in the summer. The following season, without his goals, Leeds United finished 17th. On 9 May 1958, the chairman, Sam Bolton announced Carter&#x27;s contract would not be renewed, saying,&quot;it was with regret that the decision had been reached&quot; and there were tears in his eyes when he said it. The decision was a shock to Carter.

In February 1960, Carter was appointed as Mansfield Town manager. He could not save them from relegation to Division 4 in his first season. A younger, rebuilt side finished 20th and 15th in the next 2 seasons. After a good start to the 1962/3 season, he was linked to Cardiff City in October 1962. On 11 January 1963, he left to become manager of Division 2 Middlesbrough. In 1964, Raich presented a young Philip Lowery with his town colours for Stockton Town Football club. The young team he left behind were to gain promotion back to Division 3 at the end of that season.

At Middlesbrough, his team finished 4th,10th and 17th before they parted company with Carter on 12 February 1966 when in 20th place. Subsequently, they dropped into the relegation places and were relegated at the end of the season.

== Style of playing and management ==
As a player, Carter was noted for his &quot;Carter Roar&quot;; some perceived it as Carter blaming others for his mistakes. Carter saw it as necessary to issue short and sharp instructions to teammates in a loud voice to be heard over crowd noise.

Carter was noted as a being a natural footballer who wanted his players to &quot;play it by ear&quot;, he did not want to over coach them.

In an interview with the Hull Daily Mail in February 1949, Carter joked, &quot;I used to be arrogant but I&#x27;ve matured and grown more tolerant; now I&#x27;m just conceited&quot; .

As a manager, Carter was a traditionalist with no real interest in coaching, believing in fostering a strong team spirit, being nurturing and, supportive of his players.

He could be demanding and authoritative and did not suffer fools gladly. He refused to sanction any illegal or underhand payments.

==Personal life==
When Carter reported for pre-season training in 1934, he measured 5 foot 8 inches and weighed 10 stones and 7 pounds. He&#x27;d gained an inch and 15 pounds over the previous 12 months. He was not to grow any taller. Carter was noted as &quot;silver haired&quot; during his Derby County days and advertised Nufix haircream when at Hull City.

On 26 April 1937 Carter married Rose Marsh, a long lost school friend, in Derby. Immediately after the wedding, he and best man, Bobby Gurney had to leave the reception to join up with their Sunderland teammates in the Bushey Hall Hotel, Watford, where they were preparing for the FA Cup Final. On 19 March 1943, their daughter Jennifer was born. Subsequently, Rose suffered from ill health and the family moved to Derby to be close to Rose&#x27;s parents.

On 19 November 1951, Carter and Rose opened a sweet and tobacco shop in George Street, Hull. It was sold on his appointment as Leeds United manager in 1953.

On 27 June 1953, Rose Carter died in a Hull hospital, having suffered from rheumatic fever as a child and since childbirth a weak heart. Jennifer went to live with her maternal grandmother in Sunderland.

On 3 January 1955, Carter married Patricia Dixon, a former Hull City office employee and Yorkshire netball player. On 18 June 1956, their daughter, Jane, was born. In 1969, their son, christened Raich Carter, was born.

In late 1958, the Carters opened a newsagent&#x27;s shop in Anlaby Road, opposite West Park, in Hull. Initially, business was slow due to a printing strike but improved in the summer of 1959 when they opened an ice cream parlour in a spare room in the premises.

Between managerial positions, Carter would return to live in Hull, eventually settling in Willerby.

After leaving Middlesbrough, Carter worked as a match reporter for the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot;, often reporting on matches of his former clubs. In 1968, Carter took a job to manage the sports department of the Hull Cooperative Store until it closed down a year later. In 1969, Carter accepted a role on the Pools Panel, a role that lasted 6 years. In 1969, Carter bought a local credit collection business which he ran for over 20 years.

==Death==
On 4 July 1992, Carter suffered a mild stroke, followed by a further stroke on 3 September 1993 which completely incapacitated him. He died at home in Willerby in October 1994.

After his death, his widow Pat arranged for his medal collection to be sold to the Sunderland City Council for display in the city. A request from Derby County for 4 items from his time with them to be donated to their Hall of Fame Derby County was accommodated. In October 2001, the Raich Carter Sports Centre in Hendon was opened.

==Legacy==
There is a road in Hull, that forms part of the A1033 road, named after Carter. Also named in his honour is The Raich Carter Sports Centre in the Hendon area of Sunderland, opened in 2001 near to where he grew up and loosely on the site of his hometown club&#x27;s first ever ground.

The opening game at the new KC Stadium between Hull City and Sunderland in December 2002 was played for the &#x27;Raich Carter Trophy&#x27;. The Tigers beat the Black Cats 1–0.

In 2013 he was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame, housed at the National Football Museum.

There is a mural of him painted on the gable end of the Blue House public house situated on Corporation Street, Hendon.

On 20 October 2024, Carter was inducted into Hull City&#x27;s Hall of Fame at the &#x27;Raich Carter Trophy&#x27; match against Sunderland.

<text>Walter Frederick Brown (born July 28, 1926) is an American politician and former presidential candidate of the Socialist Party USA (2004). Brown became a socialist in 1948 but served as a Democratic member of the Oregon State Senate from 1975 to 1987. Brown also served as a Socialist Party of Oregon candidate for the U.S. Congress (3rd Congressional District) in 1998, 2000, 2002 and 2004 and has been the Pacific Green Party candidate for two statewide offices.

==Family background==
Brown was born in Los Angeles, California, to Walter Andrew Brown (August 11, 1897 – November 10, 1978), attorney at law (with prior employment as an auto mechanic, truck driver, and claims adjuster), and Emily Anna (née Weber; October 30, 1897 – February 25, 1978), an elementary school teacher. His ancestry includes English, German, and French.

==Career as an attorney==

In June 1944, during World War II, Brown volunteered for active duty in the U.S. Navy at age 17. He served in the Pacific and China on the USS &quot;Carter Hall&quot; (LSD-3). After his honorable discharge in June 1946, and while in the inactive U.S. Navy Reserve, he attended the University of Southern California (USC) on the G.I. Bill, earning a B.A. in law, &quot;cum laude&quot; (1949), and a Juris Doctor (J.D.) (1952). While at USC he was a Rhodes Scholar nominee. He was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi.

In 1952, Brown was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. He was commissioned as an officer. While in the Navy he served as an attorney for disabled Navy personnel; an instructor at the U.S. Naval Justice School in Newport, Rhode Island; legal officer at Great Lakes (Illinois), Boston, and Subic Bay, Philippines; special prosecutor in Vietnam; an appellate attorney in Washington, D.C.; and as a general court-martial judge in San Diego serving in the Judge Advocate General Corps (JAG). He retired in 1970 as a commander, with 26 years of service. Brown also continued his education: Harvard Law School (constitutional law (1958)); Boston University (international relations M.A. (1961)); the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s School University of Virginia, (Master of Laws degree in military law (1965)); University of Oregon (library science M.L.S. (1975)).

Upon Brown&#x27;s retirement from the Navy he was hired as an associate professor at the Northwestern School of Law of Lewis and Clark College, teaching from 1970 to 1980. From 1975 to 1987 he also served in the Oregon State Senate as vice chair of the Judiciary Committee and as co-chair of the Legislative Counsel Committee (which drafts all bills for the Legislature). From 1989 to 1991, he served as Malheur County counsel and as Malheur County deputy district attorney. He volunteers as general counsel of the Oregon Consumer League from 1987 to 1989 and 1991 to present, and as a volunteer attorney with the Consumer Justice Alliance since 2000. In 2003 Brown received two awards from the Oregon State Bar in the active emeritus member category: one for the most Legal Services to the Poor, another for Total Hours of Pro Bono Services.

==Political career==

===Oregon Senate===
Brown served three terms in the Oregon State Senate, elected as a Democrat, from 1974 to 1986. He was responsible for passing the world&#x27;s first ban on ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in 1975, which served as a model for several other governments. The ban went into effect in 1977 in Oregon, allowing the Oregon Legislative Assembly to make any needed adjustments (such as to allow CFCs to continue to be used in inhalers for people with asthma).

===United States Congress===

Brown ran for the United States House of Representatives for Oregon&#x27;s 3rd congressional district four times against incumbent Earl Blumenauer.

===2004 presidential campaign===
Brown, a social democrat, was nominated by the Socialist Party USA (SPUSA) at their November 2003 convention over revolutionary socialist Eric Chester of Massachusetts. After the convention, party members learned that Brown had previously held anti-abortion views. Because of these views, a movement to recall Brown as the SPUSA presidential nominee ultimately failed, but much of the party&#x27;s organization failed to support the ticket. Despite this, Brown and his running mate Mary Alice Herbert won ballot access in eight states and had write-in status in eight others. On election day, Brown/Herbert earned 10,837 votes, which was more than any of the Socialist Party&#x27;s presidential candidates since 1952 and the most in the Socialist Party USA&#x27;s history. Several third party activists, including Darcy Richardson of Florida and Steve Hauser of Wisconsin, assisted with Brown&#x27;s presidential campaign.

===Oregon attorney general===
In 2008, Brown ran as a Pacific Green Party candidate for the office of Attorney General in Oregon in the November 2008 elections. Brown received 76,856 votes for 5.1% of the total vote.

===Oregon treasurer===
In June 2010, he was selected as the Pacific Green candidate for Oregon State Treasurer in the 2010 Oregon elections but he ended his campaign for their nomination and ultimately received the nomination of the Progressive Party instead and was listed as the Progressive candidate in the Oregon Voters&#x27; Pamphlet. Brown finished third of four candidates with 38,316 votes (3%).

==Other activities==

Brown is the President of the Eastside Democratic Club (not affiliated with the Democratic Party) and on their Agenda Committee as well. Brown is also on the Board of Directors for the Oregon Consumer League. He is a volunteer attorney for both the Oregon Consumer League and the Consumer-Justice Alliance. He and his wife, Beverly, volunteer to both the Sunnyside Homeless Shelter and the St. Francis Dining Hall in Portland.

===The Barbara S. and Walter F. Brown Memorial Park===
Near the conclusion of Brown&#x27;s twelve years in the Oregon State Senate, he served as Chairman of the Senate Agriculture and Forestry Committee. At that time Brown and his wife purchased of land on both sides of the Siletz River in Lincoln County on the Oregon Coast. This land had been clear-cut during World War I. The couple spent many years of hard work to reforest the land with Sitka spruce, western red cedar, and Douglas fir, all with the express intention of making a public park. When Barbara died in 1999, the park had not been completed and Walt continued to manage this forest alone. On August 8, 2007, he donated the land to Lincoln County, which guaranteed that hunting and logging would not be allowed.

<doc id="1093704" wikidata="Q527908" url="?curid=1093704" title="Samael Aun Weor">
<text>Samael Aun Weor (; March 6, 1917 – December 24, 1977), born Víctor Manuel Gómez Rodríguez, was a teacher and author of over sixty books of esoteric spirituality. He formed a new religious movement under the banner of &quot;Universal Gnosticism&quot;, or simply gnosis, and taught the practical and esoteric principles to awaken and fundamentally change the psychological condition.

He first made a name in the Gnosticism of his native country of Colombia, before moving to Mexico in 1956, where his movement gained increased popularity, and his works became popular among practitioners of occultism and Western esotericism, and were translated into other languages. His doctrine is studied widely to this day.

In 1948, Gómez referred to himself as the name of his being, Aun Weor, which means &quot;the verb or messenger of God.&quot; In 1954, after undergoing a ceremony he described as the birth of &quot;Inner Christ,&quot; he adopted the name of Samael Aun Weor, which he used until his death in 1977. Samael Aun Weor referred to his teachings as &quot;The Doctrine of Synthesis&quot;, which not only emphasizes the existence of the perennial philosophy, but that its highest teleological function is the accomplishment of &quot;Christification&quot; and &quot;Final Liberation&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Victor Manuel Gómez Rodriguez was born in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Republic of Colombia, son of Manuel Gómez Quijano and Francisca Rodríguez de Gómez. He was baptized in the Roman Catholic Church, but later rejected the Church of Rome. His childhood and family life are not well known, except that he had a brother, and his father remarried after a divorce.

He was sent to a Roman Catholic Jesuit school but soon dropped out, disappointed by religion; he was twelve years old at the time. Instead he said he invested most of his time in the study of metaphysical and esoteric treatises. At the age of 17, he was asked to lecture at the local Theosophical Chapter, and a year later was admitted into the occult society Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua (F.R.A.).

===Early adult life, marriages, and children===
Few details of his life are known between the mid-1930s and 1950. He became a spiritual vagabond of sorts, traveling with neither home nor income. At one point he said he had lived with a tribe of indigenous people in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia, learning the healing secrets which would later form the foundation of his medical treatise, &quot;Occult Medicine and Practical Magic&quot;. It was also during these years that he described his first experience of the Illuminating Void meeting his &quot;Inner Being&quot; or Atman whose name is &quot;Aun Weor&quot;, meaning in Hebrew &quot;Strength and Light&quot;.

He was briefly married to Sara Dueños and they had a son named &quot;Imperator&quot;. However, in 1946, he met and married the Lady-Adept &quot;Litelantes&quot; (born Arnolda Garro Mora) with whom he lived for 31 years and had four children: Osiris, Isis, Iris, and Hypatia. Samael Aun Weor explains that as soon as he met her, this &quot;Lady-Adept&quot; Genie began to instruct him in the Science of Jinnestan or Jinn State also known as Djinn State or Djinnestan, which involved placing the physical body in the fourth dimension. In Aztec religion this practice is known as Nahuatlism, and according to Aun Weor it is related with hyperspace.

===Career as an occult teacher and leader===
By 1948 he had started teaching a small group of students. In 1950, under the name &quot;Aun Weor&quot;, he managed to publish &quot;The Perfect Matrimony, or The Door to Enter into Initiation&quot; with the help of his close disciples. The book, later entitled &quot;The Perfect Matrimony,&quot; unveiled the secret of sexuality as the cornerstone of the world&#x27;s great religions. In it he addressed topics such as sexual transmutation, &quot;white tantra&quot;, and esoteric initiation.

According to his diary, writing about sex in such a candid manner was met with disdain by the majority of the public at the time. Seen as immoral and pornographic, Aun Weor found himself fleeing angry mobs attempting to silence him through violent means. From March 14 to 19 of 1952 Aun Weor spent five days in jail for &quot;committing the crime of healing the sick&quot;.) The account of his incarceration is recounted in a personal diary he later published as &quot;Secret Notes of a Guru&quot;.

After March 19, 1952, Aun Weor and some disciples built and lived near the &quot;Summum Supremum Sanctuarium&quot;, an &quot;underground temple&quot; in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia. On October 27, 1954, Aun Weor received what is referred to as the &quot;Initiation of Tiphereth&quot;, which, according to his doctrine, is the beginning of the incarnation of the Logos or &quot;Glorian&quot; within the soul. He states that in his case the name of his Glorian has always been called &quot;Samael&quot; through the ages. From then on, he would sign his name Samael Aun Weor.

Aun Weor stated that this union of Samael (the Logos) with Aun Weor (the human soul) is the Maitreya Buddha Kalki Avatar of the New Age of Aquarius. Upon being asked exactly what such a title meant, he replied:
Although he would declare himself as the true Kalki Avatar many times throughout his works, he regularly rejected idolization:
===Living in Mexico City===
In 1956, he left Colombia and went to Costa Rica and El Salvador. Later in 1956, he settled permanently in Mexico City, where he would begin his public life.

Before 1960, he had arguably published 20 more books with topics ranging from endocrinology and criminology to kundalini yoga. He founded numerous Gnostic Institutions and created Gnostic centers in Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Venezuela. A &quot;triangle&quot; relationship was established between the Universal Gnostic Movement founded by Samael Aun Weor, the South American Liberation Action (ALAS) in Argentina headed by Francisco A. Propato, Ph.D. (graduate of La Sorbonne and Spanish translator of &quot;The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam&quot;), and the Sivananda Aryabarta Ashram directed by Swami Sivananda in India.

In spite of its success, the development of the Gnostic Movement was not without dramatic setbacks, according to its followers. By the time of publishing the revised edition of &quot;The Perfect Matrimony&quot; (1961), the movement had fallen apart. Aun Weor wrote that &quot;those who did not leave the Gnostic Movement can be counted on the fingers of one hand.&quot; However, by the time of his death, Samael Aun Weor had completely re-established the broad international reaches the movement previously held.

Into the 1960s, he continued to write many books on topics, such as hermetic astrology, flying saucers, and the Kabbalah. However, he also wrote sociopolitical works such as the &quot;Platform of POSCLA&quot; (Partido Socialista Cristiano Latinoamericano, or Latin-American Christian Socialist Party) and &quot;The Social Christ&quot;. Topics such as the &quot;false&quot; doctrines of Wall Street materialism, atheism, and particularly Marxism-Leninism are discussed. POSCLA&#x27;s motto was given as, &quot;All for one and one for all,&quot; and its method, the conscious practice of ahimsa.

===Final written work===
In the last decade of his life, he penned works such as &quot;Parsifal Unveiled&quot;, which details the esoteric symbolism of the Wagner opera, and &quot;Gnostic Anthropology&quot; in which he heavily criticized the theories of Darwin, Haeckel, &quot;and their followers&quot;. The books &quot;The Great Rebellion&quot;, &quot;Treatise of Revolutionary Psychology&quot;, and &quot;The Revolution of the Dialectic&quot; provide a ground work for the vast knowledge of esoteric psychology purported to be found rooted in every genuine religion. During this time, he was preparing the highest vehicle of his doctrine, &quot;The Pistis Sophia Unveiled&quot;, in which he meditated, verse-by-verse, upon the Gnostic text &quot;Pistis Sophia&quot;.

===Death===
By 1972, Samael Aun Weor wrote that his death and resurrection would be occurring before 1978. In the chapter entitled &quot;The Resurrection,&quot; in his work &quot;The Three Mountains&quot; (1972), he stated that the eight years of ordeals within the &quot;Trial of Job&quot; would occur between his 53rd and 61st birthdays. Furthermore, in the same work, it is stated that this ordeal occurs prior to resurrection, and the one going through it is &quot;deprived of everything, even of his own sons, and is afflicted by an impure sickness.&quot; By August 1977 he had developed stomach cancer. During this time he continued to speak to both his students and the general public, giving radio and television interviews while touring Mexico. Eventually he was forced to stop, due to debilitating stomach pain. As his condition steadily worsened, he would mention to those at his bedside, &quot;Don&#x27;t cling to my battered body, instead cling to my doctrinal body.&quot; Aun Weor died on December 24, 1977.

Years before his death, he declared he would adopt the use of a duly prepared ancient Egyptian &quot;mummy&quot; as a vehicle for further work, a vehicle better prepared than his own &quot;physical body&quot;. Many of his followers expected him to return publicly shortly after his death. According to his own statements he planned to remain incognito for a certain time so that “the leaven will ferment.”

== Doctrine of Synthesis ==

The Doctrine of Synthesis is a term Aun Weor used to describe the teachings he delivered through his books and lectures, because it is an amalgam of an extensive variety of teachings.

Although many of the metaphysical concepts expounded by such authors as Blavatsky, Steiner, and Gurdjieff provide a conceptual foundation in Aun Weor&#x27;s teachings, he considered these works and movements conceptual preparation for the real unveiling of occultism or gnosis that he taught.

Aun Weor emphasizes that his doctrine is experiential, and must be put into practice for it to be of any value to the student. Throughout his works there are hundreds of techniques and exercises that are of help in the development of psychic powers, for example leaving the dense physical body at will (astral projection), in order to be taught in the schools of the &quot;Higher Worlds.&quot; The techniques are always combined with meditation and sexual transmutation, and the perfection of such powers may take more than one lifetime.

It is stated that if a student is successful in awakening consciousness, he or she will eventually experience a continuous state of vigilance not only during the day but also while the physical body is sleeping, and most importantly after death. This is significant because Aun Weor states that those who have a sleeping consciousness are not aware of their postmortem condition, just as they are not aware when they are physically sleeping. The awakening of consciousness allows a student to continue to work regardless of their physical state.

===Religion===

Religions are viewed as idiosyncratic expressions of immutable and eternal values. Religions are said to be born and die in time, yet their spiritual values always remain eternal. When a religious form has fulfilled its mission, it begins to degenerate and dies, then a new messenger appears and delivers a doctrine appropriate for that culture. Different cultures require different doctrines for their development and this results in a vast difference of religious doctrines. Nevertheless, if one understands their core values, all religions naturally support each other. It is stated that any authentic religion possess what are called &quot;The Three Factors of the Revolution of the Consciousness&quot; which are practical aspects of daily life:

#Death: The psychological work of eliminating the ego.
#Birth: Giving birth to the superior potential of the soul, which is done through chastity and sexual transmutation.
#Sacrifice: To work to aid suffering humanity &quot;without desiring the fruits of action, without desiring reward; pure, sincere, disinterested sacrifice, giving one&#x27;s life in order for others to live, and without asking for anything in return.&quot;

Among these 3 factors, Aun Weor highlights that the first one is the most important. 
A teaching that is missing any one of these components is considered incomplete or degenerate.

===Psychology===

The basis of Aun Weor&#x27;s practical work is of a psychological nature. He states in many of his books that the purpose of his doctrine is to affect a psychological change. The terms Gnostic, Esoteric or Revolutionary Psychology are used to describe the psychological methods taught, and are said to be synonymous with the psychological teachings of religion.

A fundamental axiom presented is that an ordinary human being is not really human at all, but rather an intellectual animal (a rational animal) with consciousness asleep. According to Samael Aun Weor, a true human being is someone who has no psychological imperfection, an image of God, as in Jesus&#x27; saying, &quot;Become perfect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.&quot; He believed himself to be an example of such a &#x27;human being&#x27;. Aun Weor writes of the awakening of consciousness as being very similar to the traditional Buddhist understanding, and throughout his works he describes many analogous processes as they are spoken of in different religions.

In order to awaken the consciousness correctly, Aun Weor stated it was necessary to annihilate the ego. He taught that one&#x27;s ego is really not one but many, or a multitude of independent, contradictory desires. Likewise, each person&#x27;s ego is said to actually contain many &quot;I&#x27;s,&quot; many &quot;egos,&quot; many &quot;aggregates.&quot; Each desire is an &quot;I&quot; and each &quot;I&quot; has its own specific causes and conditions that lead to its personification at a particular time. This is the mechanism behind what is commonly called &quot;changing one&#x27;s mind&quot; (metanoia) because when one &quot;I&quot; changes to another a literal exchange of personified psychological aggregates has taken place. This &quot;doctrine of the many&quot;, the Plural &#x27;I&#x27; or Pluralized Ego, is the same as that taught by G.I. Gurdjieff and his disciple P. D. Ouspensky and is one of the reasons Aun Weor was sometimes accused of plagiarism. To this he responded that Gurdjieff was not the author of this doctrine and that its origin is found in Egypt and Tibet.

====Consciousness====

Consciousness is described as a state of being, very closely related to God. The consciousness within the normal person is said to be 97% asleep. Consciousness asleep is consciousness that is subconscious, unconscious, or infraconscious, which are various levels of psychological sleep. Psychological sleep is a way to describe the lack of self-awareness, meaning that the common and ordinary person is not aware of 97% of what constitutes the ordinary state of being. A consciousness asleep is caused by what Aun Weor calls identification, fascination, or the incorrect transformation of impressions, which all imply a type of consciousness that is not aware of its own processes. It is said that to awaken consciousness one must understand that his or her consciousness is asleep. This implies that one must begin to understand every impulse, action, thought and movement one makes, a feat that is said to be accomplished through the mental discipline of meditation and self-observation. Furthermore, it is stated that the awakening of consciousness is the only way to acquiring gnosis and achieve a true and radical change by removing the spurious psychological aggregates that cause unnecessary suffering. The awakening of consciousness goes hand in hand with the transmutation of sexual energy because the higher states of consciousness depend upon the energy of sexual transmutation.

====Psychological aggregates====

The purpose of the psychological work is to dissolve all the psychological aggregates one has accumulated. The term &quot;psychological or mystical death&quot; is often used to describe the process one must undergo in order to reach liberation.&quot;Psychological aggregates&quot; are commonly known simply as aggregates in Buddhism, yet it is taught that other religions used a more veiled or less sophisticated method to describe them, such as: the &quot;Legion&quot; that Jesus is described as removing from a man in and Luke 8 in one of the alleged Miracles of Jesus; overcoming the tortures of the 49 Self-willed demons of Yaldabaoth written in the Pistis Sophia; the killing of the &quot;unbelievers&quot; in Islam; Moses escaping the tyranny of the Egyptians; Arjuna fighting against his own blood (the ego); the demons of Seth that attack Osiris; Jesus throwing the merchants out of the temple; the archetypal death and resurrection of the &quot;Solar Hero&quot; exemplified in the stories of Jesus and Osiris; the descent to Dante&#x27;s Inferno (representing our unconscious) or Paradise Lost&#x27;s Pandemonium in order to accomplish a great task, such as those performed by Hercules or Orpheus; the archetypal Dragon (ego) that must be slayed by the Knight, etc. Aun Weor states that this specific paradigm is called &quot;The Doctrine of the Many&quot; and has been taught in esoteric schools and religions since the beginning of time. The anatomy of the pluralized self being the divine spark imprisoned within hundreds of psychological aggregates.

In order to achieve psychological transformation, extensive methods of meditation, self-observation, and sexual transmutation are taught and prescribed for daily exercise. The goal of psychological work is the awakening of consciousness and ultimately the state of Paramarthasatya.

===Physiology and sexology===

Basic physiology is studied, mostly endocrinology and the hormonal influence of primary and secondary sexual characteristics. It is taught that there are three fundamental nervous systems, the cerebrospinal nervous system, grand sympathetic nervous system, and the parasympathetic nervous system. These nervous systems are referred to as the &quot;Three Brains&quot; or three centers of the intellectual animal, and are named the &quot;intellectual center&quot;, the &quot;emotional center&quot;, and the &quot;motor-instinctual-sexual center&quot;. Each center is studied in relation to the types of energies or &quot;occult hydrogens&quot; that animate them, the frequency at which each center operates (sexual center being the fastest, then emotional, then intellectual), and how psychological aggregates form and act within each center: psychological aggregates that are expressed through the intellect one way and through the emotions in a different way.

====Three centers and three traitors====
The three centers are directly related to the Trinity, Trimurti, or threefoldness of creation, the intellect being related to the Father (Kether, affirmation, positive), the emotion related to the Son (Chokmah, denial, negation), and the sexual center related to the Holy Spirit (Binah, reconcile, neutral). The primary energy of the intellectual brain (Father) is the air, which is then placed in the bloodstream which is related to the emotional brain (Son), and lastly the final condensation of blood is found in the semen or sexual hormones, which is directly related to the Holy Spirit: that which impregnates or manifests creation, Shakti, etc.

Aun Weor teaches that psychological aggregates form in one of these three centers; therefore, it is said that there are three fundamental defects: the demon of the mind related to the intellectual center, the demon of desire related to the emotional center, and the demon of evil will related to the motor-instinctual-sexual center. They are collectively referred to as the &quot;Three Traitors&quot;, and many references to religion are found that are held to symbolize them, for example: Judas (desire), Pilate (intellect), and Caiaphas (will) who crucify Jesus; Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum who murder Hiram Abiff; Seth, in the form of the serpent Apophis and its two monstrous helpers Sebau and Nakmurders Osiris; the three Furies who attack Orestes; the three daughters of Mara who attack Gautama Buddha and who are conquered through right Thinking (Intellectual Center), right Feeling (Emotional Center), and right Action (Motor-Instinctual-Sexual Center) (see Noble Eightfold Path).

====Lunar and solar bodies====
Occult or esoteric anatomy and physiology is also studied, which refers to the study of the supra-sensible bodies of minerals, plants, animals (rational and irrational), and human beings. It is said that everyone contains seven bodies, closely related to the Theosophical septenary, which Aun Weor calls physical, vital, emotional (astral), mental, causal, buddhic and atmic. Aun Weor differentiates between an intellectual animal and an authentic human being through the differences in the vehicles of emotion (astral body), mind (mental body) and will (causal body). Intellectual animals (ordinary man and woman) are said to contain the Lunar Astral Body, the Lunar Mental Body, and the Lunar Causal Body, each referred to by different names in different schools of Occultism. It is stated that these lunar bodies are the result of mechanical evolution through the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms and therefore, they are of an infrahuman or animal quality. The only true difference between the rational animal and irrational animals is the intellect, which gives the former the ability to become human, or as Aun Weor states, the intellectual animal has the &quot;seed&quot; or potential of a human latently existing within its sexual organs.

What are called authentic human beings, although physically appearing identical, have crystallized the solar bodies: &quot;solar astral body, solar mental body&quot;, and &quot;solar causal body&quot;. Lunar bodies are vehicles that receive the energy of creation (that is, God) at the level of an animal, while the solar bodies permit the reception of a much greater voltage allowing greater levels of wisdom and superior emotion to be incarnated. Aun Weor states that the solar bodies are collectively referred to as vehicles of the &quot;soul&quot;.

Aun Weor states that the solar bodies are formed in the same manner that physical bodies are formed: through use of the sexual function. In order to form the solar bodies, sexual transmutation is taught via the hetero sexual magic of married couples engaged in coitus without orgasm or seminal ejaculation. Sexual magic is the arousal of sexual energies through the act of coitus between husband and wife, but instead of expelling those energies through orgasm they are transmuted into higher octaves of energy. Each successive Solar Body is the result of the saturation of transmuted sexual energy at its respective octave: first, the &quot;Christ Astral&quot; is formed by transmuting the sex energy into a second octave; second, the &quot;Christ Mind&quot; is formed by saturating, condensing or crystallizing the sexual energy into a third octave, and the causal body or &quot;Christ Will&quot; is formed by transmuting the sexual energy called &quot;Hydrogen SI-12&quot;, into a fourth octave. The &quot;birth&quot; of the solar bodies is what Aun Weor states is the true meaning of being &quot;born again.&quot; It is taught that the solar bodies are referred to in the Bible as the three sons of Noah or the three companions of Daniel in the (alchemical) furnace of Nebuchadnezzar.

====Three forms of sexuality====

The topic of sexuality is approached from a very stern point of view, and it is indeed the crux of Aun Weor&#x27;s entire message. He states that there are three fundamental types of sexuality: suprasexuality, which is the sexual functioning of someone like Buddha or Jesus, who naturally transmutes all their energy perfectly; normal sexuality, which is defined as those who have no sexual conflict of any kind whatsoever and who transmute their sexual energy or use it to procreate the species; finally, the two spheres of infrasexuality, as described in the Kabbalistic texts: Nahemah&#x27;s sphere of influence which includes fornication, adultery, addiction and prostitution and Lilith&#x27;s sphere of influence, a category which includes homosexuality, masturbation, abortion, bestiality, sado-masochism and any other &quot;abuse&quot; of the sexual energy. In response to his harsh views towards sex (especially for a &quot;New Age&quot; teacher), he wrote:

===Soteriology===

Soteriology (study of salvation) is presented in the light of every notable religion yet usually with special differences not held by orthodox interpretations. There are many degrees of salvation generally accomplished by paying one&#x27;s karma, removing the psychological imperfections and finally creating the solar bodies. The idea held by many religions that belief in God alone achieves salvation is categorically rejected.

Many different levels of salvation are explained, each depending upon the willpower of the individual accomplishing it. For those who do not remove their psychological imperfection (ego) – which is the cause of karma and the suffering of humanity – after approximately 108 rebirths they will have their ego removed forcefully through mechanical devolution within the infradimensions (Hell). Here it is said that &quot;Mother Nature&quot; mechanically pays out one&#x27;s accumulated karma through a great deal of suffering over thousands of years until one is returned to the state of an innocent elemental, or Essence. This is said to be a state of being that is total happiness, yet not cognizant happiness and therefore not complete happiness. Hell is not taught as a place of eternal damnation, just a place to pay one&#x27;s karma, and in fact it is seen as a part of God&#x27;s grace because if the ego is not removed forcefully, these souls would continue to suffer indefinitely. It is held that after Hell, the elemental is reinserted into the mechanics of evolution in order to once again attempt to gain conscious happiness: They are first inserted at the basic level of existence (minerals), and through millions of years, transmigrate through increasingly complex organisms until the state of intellectual animal is reached again.

For those who do work on themselves, depending on the degree of perfection, happiness and wisdom they wish to attain, two distinct paths emerge: the Straight Path of the Razor&#x27;s Edge and the Spiral Path. The Spiral Path involves reaching a state of relative enlightenment by choosing the enjoyment of the Higher Worlds (Heaven or Nirvana), and occasionally returning to a physical body in order to pay out a little more karma and help humanity in the process. Aun Weor refers to these as the Pratyeka Buddhas and Sravakas, and that the vast majority who reach this state choose the Spiral Path because it is very easy and enjoyable. The dangerous Straight Path of the Razor&#x27;s Edge is the Path of the Bodhisattva who renounces the happiness of the Higher Worlds (Nirvana) in order to help humanity. In the doctrine of Aun Weor, the Bodhisattva has a very specific definition, as it is not merely someone who has taken the Bodhisattva vows. It is the physical (Malkuth), vital (Yesod), astral (Hod), mental (Netzach) and causal (Tiphereth) vehicles – in other words the human soul – of a self-realized spirit, (Geburah-Chesed) who has chosen the Straight Path of the Razor&#x27;s Edge in order to incarnate the Christ (Kether-Binah-Chokmah). In other words, the Bodhisattva is the &quot;Son&quot; of a self-realized God who is trying to return to the Absolute or 13th Aeon of the Pistis Sophia.

====Christology====

Christ is viewed as the savior but not as traditionally understood by contemporary Christianity. Instead, Christ is an impersonal force or intelligence that emanates from the Absolute as the Trinity and is also referred to as the Cosmic Christ. Christ is said to have existed before Jesus, and is represented in different traditions with names such as Thoth, Ormuz, Ahura Mazda, Osiris, Zeus, Jupiter, Quetzalcoatl, Okidanokh, Kulkulcan, Chrestos, Baldur, and Avalokitesvara. It is held that Christ enters into and exalts any individual who is properly prepared, which denotes the complete annihilation of the ego, the exhaustion of all karma and the birth of the solar vehicles, the latter is necessary to handle the super high voltage of Christ. Aun Weor writes that only those who choose the previously mentioned Straight Path of the Razor&#x27;s Edge can incarnate the Christ because the Spiral Path is not a path of total sacrifice. Likewise, any true Bodhisattva has incarnated the Christ or is in process of doing so. It is said that in history Christ incarnated in Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, Krishna, Moses, Padmasambhava, John the Baptist, Milarepa, Mahavatar Babaji, Joan of Arc, Fu Xi, Ramakrishna as well as many others now forgotten by time (or made up in works of fiction) e. g. Zanoni

It is important to notice that some of these individuals represent Christ as an impersonal force, e. g. Jesus, meaning that although he was an individual Christ, he taught the doctrine of the Cosmic Christ, intentionally molding his physical life after the psychological processes that one undergoes to incarnate the Christ. As with Buddha, Jesus is seen as a Bodhisattva who came to help humanity. Jesus is viewed as the Savior of the World because he is a Paramarthasatya (an inhabitant of the Absolute) that physically incarnated specifically for the sake of poor suffering humanity. According to Aun Weor, Jesus purposefully played out physically the internal or psychological struggle one must undergo in the path of Self-Realization; thus, the Gospels are a mixture of reality and kabbalistic, initiatic symbolism.
 According to Aun Weor, there is the historic Christ as depicted in Christian Churches; then, there is the Christ of Transubstantiation to be known exclusively through the Gnostic Church; and finally, there is the Apocalyptic Christ who is to come with the New Jerusalem, after the Great Cataclysm that will consume the world.

===Anthropology===
His work &quot;Cosmic Teachings of a Lama&quot; states that life on Earth did not occur through abiogenesis, but instead through pansperma. To Aun Weor, the theories of abiogenesis are similar to those of spontaneous generation, and that Pasteur had already implicitly refuted the former when the latter was empirically disproved. Furthermore, while evolution is a verified fact of nature, speciation through Darwinian evolution has never been witnessed and is &quot;an absurd theory without basis or foundation.&quot; Instead, the sum of zoological variation is determined by the seeds of life traveling throughout space (protected by electromagnetic &quot;whirlwinds&quot;) which determine the evolution and devolution of life on any planet. Life, according to Aun Weor, is eternal, however its expression is divided into evolutive and devolutive modes: species evolve, reach a pinnacle, and necessarily devolve and return to a germinal state.

Man, therefore, is not the outcome of the evolution from a common ancestor to the primates, but rather the exponent of an eternal anthropic principle. Monkeys, apes, and other primates are instead the outcome of certain sub-sects of ancient humanity copulating with animals, and are in a complete state of devolution.

He does state however that evolution within a species is possible, yet that no species can evolve from another species. Furthermore, he states that the human or &#x27;intellectual animal&#x27; naturally evolves in time, for example our society is an evolution from previous societies - however the evolution of species can never achieve spiritual liberation because it will always return to devolution. Spiritual liberation requires a &#x27;revolution of consciousness&#x27;.

=== Eschatology ===
In many books Aun Weor wrote about the &quot;Final Catastrophe&quot; or Apocalypse which was central to the framing of his teachings. His work &quot;The Aquarian Message&quot; is a commentary on the Book of Revelation, which affirms the notion that present civilization will end and a future one will emerge. Only those souls who remove their ego in the present time will avoid the Second Death and re-transmigrations. A specific date is never given, only that this civilization is in the twilight of its existence.

===&quot;The Social Christ&quot; and POSCLA===
Aun Weor wrote about social problems in the books &quot;The Social Christ&quot; and &quot;The Social Transformation of Humanity&quot;. &quot;The Social Christ&quot; is primarily concerned with a comprehensive critique of Marxism or Dialectical Materialism, but deals also with the injustices of the Capitalist system;

We are filled with horror in the presence of so much infamy. The ones that cannot pay for a stall in the public markets are persecuted, but they flatter and butter up the powerful gentlemen that steal millions of pesos from the people.In this way the capitalists fertilize the soil and prepare it in order that in it the filthy flower of Communism can germinate.

All political systems, Aun Weor states, are a reflection of our own psychology, and he explains that in order to finally finish with oppression it is necessary to change our own psychological state through the Death of Ego, combining this with non-violent resistance and the unionization of workers.The struggle for the triumph of social justice is very long and hard, but we must never use violence, nor revolutions of blood and liquor.

In order &quot;to start a new age and realize the Social Christ on the face of the earth,&quot; Aun Weor formed a political party called &#x27;POSCLA&#x27;, The Christian Socialist Party of Latin America, which he later disbanded as a formal organization.

===Medicine and elemental magic===

In his works, &quot;Occult Medicine and Practical Magic&quot;, &quot;Igneous Rose&quot; and others, Aun Weor taught about elemental magic. In the former work he expressed his opposition to the medicine of modern science, allopathy, and called for the Gnostics to learn the ways of Indigenous and Elemental Medicine.

Aun Weor taught that all the plants of nature are living Elemental Spirits, similarly to Paracelsus and many other esoteric teachers. He states that it is the Elemental Spirits who cure, not simply the &#x27;cadavers of the plants&#x27;. Plants should be treated as living beings, harvested at the proper hours etc. He stated that the Elementals of all plants are aspects of The Divine Mother in the form of Mother Nature. In &#x27;Occult Medicine and Practical Magic&#x27; he spoke about the healing methods of the Kogi Mamas, who diagnose sicknesses by means of clairvoyance.

==Criticism==
The Roman Catholic Church has labeled Aun Weor&#x27;s neo-Gnostic Movement as a pseudo-church and some Roman Catholic authors have accused Aun Weor of trying to seduce Roman Catholic priests and nuns to abandon their vows of celibacy and practice the sexual teachings promulgated by the neo-Gnostic Movement; these authors also believe that the current wave to discredit the legitimacy of the Roman Catholic Church comes from the same source while others go so far as to label it heresy.

As of 11 February 1984 or thereabouts, the Ministry of Tenerife, Spain, denied incorporation to Aun Weor&#x27;s Universal Christian Gnostic Church of Spain operating from 38 San Francisco St., in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, on the grounds that said organization is not a legitimate church as it does not have any record of incorporation as such in any country whatsoever.

In 1990, after numerous consultations with high-ranking members of the Roman Catholic Church and other figures who preferred to remain anonymous such as lawyers, public prosecutors, psychiatrists and psychologists, Pilar Salarrullana, who has been a political figure since 1974 and is considered an expert on sects, published &quot;Las Sectas&quot; (&quot;The Sects: a living testament to Messianic terror in Spain&quot;), which became a best-seller with six editions the first year alone and, in spite of its popularly inquisitorial tone, it denounces the Gnostic Movements among others as some of the most dangerous anti-social plagues in Spain.

In 1991, F. W. Haack (1935–1991), who was chief delegate of the Evangelical Church with responsibility for sects and ideologies, attacked Weor&#x27;s ideology in a German book published in Zürich — nevertheless, the Gnostic branches of the movement in Germany and Switzerland are still active and expanding. The Gnostic associations are active in Switzerland with a moderate following of Italian-, French- and German-speaking members.

<text>Theodore Curson (June 3, 1935 – November 4, 2012) was an American jazz trumpeter.

==Life and career==
Curson was born in Philadelphia. He became interested in playing trumpet after watching a newspaper salesman play a silver trumpet. Curson&#x27;s father, however, wanted him to play alto saxophone like Louis Jordan. When he was ten, he gained his first trumpet.

He attended Granoff School of Music in Philadelphia. At the suggestion of Miles Davis, he moved to New York in 1956. He performed and recorded with Cecil Taylor in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His composition &quot;Tears for Dolphy&quot; has been used in numerous films. He was featured in a profile on composer Graham Collier in the 1985 Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Hoarded Dreams&quot;.

He was a familiar face in Finland, having performed at the Pori Jazz festival every year since it began in 1966. In 2007, he performed at Finland&#x27;s Independence Day Ball at the invitation of president Tarja Halonen.

A longtime resident of Montclair, New Jersey, Curson died from a heart attack in the township on November 4, 2012.

<text>Abigail Marjorie &quot;Abby&quot; Lockhart, M.D. (née Wyczenski) is a fictional character from the NBC medical drama series &quot;ER,&quot; portrayed by Maura Tierney. She first appears as a guest star in the first half of the sixth season, before becoming a main character later that season, appearing until the beginning of the fifteenth season. Tierney returned to make one final guest appearance later in season fifteen. 

== Beginnings ==

The character Abby Lockhart first appears in season 6 of &quot;ER&quot; in the episode &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, guest starring as Carol Hathaway&#x27;s (Julianna Margulies) labor and delivery nurse. Three months later, she became a regular character. She first made an appearance in February 2000 as a third-year medical student beginning her ER rotation. On her first day, she meets Dr. Luka Kovač (Goran Visnjic), her first teacher, with whom she will experience both a professional and personal relationship, and who will become the most important character in her long-running story. Lockhart&#x27;s first months in the ER prove challenging for her, transitioning from OB nursing, to the ER. In that time, she sees Carter stabbed, and a medical student, Lucy Knight killed by a patient with schizophrenia. She also has had to speak to superiors Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes) and Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards) about John Carter&#x27;s (Noah Wyle) growing drug addiction. Although Carter is hostile at first, he and Abby become friends over the course of the next season.

Abby&#x27;s medical training had gone into hiatus and she had become a full-time obstetrics nurse to provide for her then-husband Richard Lockhart&#x27;s medical school education. Once they divorced, she resumed her medical training. At the start of season 7, Weaver breaks the news that her registration for her final year of medical school has been denied due to lack of payment. Abby confronts her ex-husband, who has stopped paying her tuition because had become bankrupt. She resumes her part-time OB nursing job. Soon, Weaver offers her a full-time ER nursing position, which she accepts. After several rewarding years as a nurse, Abby gets her ex-husband to sign off on a loan so she can finish medical school. The loan defaults, but John Carter pays the deficit. After she fails her first board certification exam, she passes on her second try. This leads to the earning of her MD in the Season 10 finale. Abby&#x27;s first day as a doctor begins when Pratt and Chen fall victim to a road rage incident. Abby is called in as a doctor to help save her friends&#x27; lives.

In the 2000–2001 season, Abby is visited by her mother, Maggie Wyczenski (Sally Field), who has bipolar disorder. Abby&#x27;s childhood is revealed to have been very difficult: she was forced to cope with her mother&#x27;s erratic behavior and long absences and had to take care of her younger brother Eric (Tom Everett Scott). Eric is introduced in later episodes. He is in the US Air Force but goes AWOL and is showing signs of bipolar disorder. He refuses to accept it and clashes with both Abby and Maggie as a result. Abby eventually reconciles with her mother during the beginning of Season 13 as Maggie is taking medications for her disorder regularly, and Abby is grateful for her support when her son Joe is born prematurely.

Abby&#x27;s father, Eddie, left the family when Abby was a child, due at least in part to Maggie&#x27;s uncontrollable behavior. Abby reunites with her father (Fred Ward) in season 13, when he initially approaches her under the guise of being a patient named Eddie Jackson before finally revealing his true identity to her. Abby tells him to stay away from her, although she later considers inviting him to her wedding.

Abby dates Dr. Kovač, Dr. Carter and Jake, a medical student, but eventually reunites with Kovač, with whom she has a son. They later marry. She befriends many colleagues in the ER throughout the series, co-workers such as Susan Lewis, and Kerry Weaver. Her closest friend is Dr. Neela Rasgotra, who graduates medical school with her and lives with her during some of Neela&#x27;s hard times. As Carter is phased out of the show and Weaver departs midway through Season 13, Abby and Luka Kovač are the senior figures on the show until their departure in 2009.

== Personal life ==
Prior to beginning medical school at County, Abby was married to Richard Lockhart; she and Richard were expecting a child at one point, but Abby chose to have an abortion, since she was afraid the child would have bipolar disorder like her mother. Abby never told her family about the pregnancy and Richard was unaware of it until after the abortion. The marriage began to break down after a short time, with Richard frustrated at Abby&#x27;s abortion and depression, and Abby angry over his insensitivity, since she was working overtime at home and at work to help pay for his medical schooling. They finally split for good when Richard cheated on her and part of the divorce agreement was that he would pay for her medical schooling. Abby chose to keep her married name of Lockhart, claiming &quot;it&#x27;s the only good thing I got out of the whole mess.&quot;

Soon after taking the position in the ER, Abby begins a relationship with Dr. Luka Kovač, who is initially a mentor figure to her until she has to quit medical school. The beginning of their relationship is strained when they are attacked by a mugger on their first date, whom Luka kills in defense. She and Luka stay together for about a year, but their relationship becomes more strained after the arrival of Abby&#x27;s mother and the increasing closeness between Abby and Dr. John Carter, and a heated argument leads to their break up at the beginning of the eighth season.

Despite an initial period of awkwardness and jealousy after their romance ends, Luka and Abby become good friends again. She criticizes him and expresses her concern when he behaves badly towards other staff during his depressive episode in season 9. From seasons 9 to 11 the two are very close friends, although their mutual attraction is still sometimes visible. In season 8 Abby&#x27;s neighbor Brian attacks her for protecting his abused wife, leaving Abby with a horribly bruised face. After allowing her to recover at his apartment, Luka traces Brian to a bar and beats him, threatening to kill him if he comes near Abby again.

Abby&#x27;s next relationship is with Dr. John Carter. Abby discovers Carter shooting up on painkillers during season 6. She tells the senior doctors about it, and at their urging and with their help, Carter enters a rehab program. Once he returns, he sees Abby at an AA meeting. She tells him that she is a recovering alcoholic and had been sober for five years. Against AA/NA suggestions, she agrees to become his AA sponsor. However, she drops the role as his sponsor after Carter’s refusal to take his recovery seriously. Abby and Carter develop a strong friendship, which strains her relationship with Luka. Several months later, Abby has a particularly horrible birthday and starts drinking again. When Carter catches her having a beer a few weeks after she was attacked, he confronts her, and she tells him not to worry about her. When Dr. Mark Greene passes away at the end of season 8, Carter seeks solace in Abby. She returns to her AA meetings, telling Carter she is doing it for him, and they are a couple throughout season 9. Abby continues drinking on occasion, however, and Carter compulsively tries to &quot;fix&quot; and &quot;change&quot; her. At one point, Carter is ready to propose to Abby at a special dinner he&#x27;s arranged for her. After Abby states that she is not changing, he puts the ring back in his pocket; although they discuss it briefly in a later episode, he never proposes again. Their relationship is badly strained when Carter&#x27;s grandmother (Frances Sternhagen) dies, and Abby&#x27;s brother, Eric, conclusively diagnosed with bipolar disorder, acts out at the funeral and falls into the grave. Soon after, Carter flies to the Congo and joins Luka, who is volunteering with Doctors Without Borders. On his return, Abby is extremely hostile towards him, kicking him out of her apartment, asking for her key to be returned and returning things of his. When Carter goes to Africa for a second time to recover the body of Luka, who, in a plot twist, has not actually died, he sends Abby a letter, ruling out all hope of reconciliation. Abby and Carter remain cordial after a period of distance between them, especially when Carter returns to Chicago with his pregnant girlfriend Kem; however, they are not in contact after Carter departs County in season 11.

Abby briefly dates a medical student named Jake in season 11, but their relationship fizzles when Abby does not respond positively to Jake&#x27;s desires to stay in Chicago to be with her. She also begins to grow closer in her friendships with Dr. Susan Lewis and Dr. Kerry Weaver. Her closest friend is Neela Ragostra, a bond formed while both were medical students in season 10. Dr. Lucien Dubenko, Chief of Surgery, is attracted to her for some time, but Abby does not return his affections, seeing him as just a friend. Nonetheless, Lucien remains rather protective of her for several seasons.

In season 12, Abby rekindles her relationship with Luka in the episode &quot;The Human Shield&quot; when her attempt to vent her frustration at him turns into a kiss and subsequently sleeping together. Initially, they decide to remain friends, but soon become lovers, noting that they always seem to find their way back to each other. Three weeks into their relationship, it is revealed that Abby is pregnant. Despite clearly wanting another child, his own having perished in Croatia, Luka states that he will support whatever choice she makes, as long as they can still remain together. After a week or so of uncertainty, Abby decides to keep the baby. Luka proposes to Abby while she is pregnant, but Abby is not comfortable with the idea because of her past problems, and later claims she &#x27;doesn&#x27;t need a white dress&#x27; to prove she loves him. Their baby, a son named Josip (after Luka&#x27;s father), or Joe for short (after Joe Frazier, the boxer whom Abby&#x27;s long-disappeared father was a fan of) is born prematurely by emergency C-section at the beginning of season 13. Abby has to have an emergency hysterectomy. Joe spends several weeks in the hospital&#x27;s NICU, requiring surgery during his stay. The trauma of their son&#x27;s birth and hospital stay takes a toll on them both, but they appear much happier in later episodes, caring for their now healthy baby boy.

Throughout season 13, Abby is shown growing into her role as Joe&#x27;s mother, first by taking time off to be with her seriously ill baby, then by participating in activities like Mommy and Baby classes and walks in the park, and then later by gradually reintroducing herself into the ER world. Mid-season, tension develops between Abby and Luka, partly as the result of Luka&#x27;s apparently paranoid behavior regarding Curtis Ames (Forest Whitaker), a disgruntled former patient who has sued Luka due to a stroke he suffered that cost him the use of his arm. Not realizing that Ames approached her and Joe in the park posing as a friendly stranger, and has been stalking both her and Luka for some time after he lost the case, Abby brushes off Luka&#x27;s concerns. However, Ames breaks into Abby and Luka&#x27;s apartment with a gun, and demands to see Luka. Abby tries to bargain with him, telling him that she is a recovering alcoholic, and recounting an occasion where she felt she had hit &#x27;rock bottom&#x27;. Luka is taken hostage, threatened and has his hand crushed by Ames, but survives when Ames commits suicide. In the next episode, an emotional Abby asks Luka to propose to her again. She says if they got through the shooting incident and the Curtis Ames nightmare, they can get through anything - he proposes and the couple get engaged. Later Luka realises that Abby is freaked out about planning the wedding, so he decides to prepare a surprise wedding for her. At first, she has her doubts but eventually she agrees and asks Neela Rasgotra to be her maid of honor.

At the end of the thirteenth season, Abby and Luka plan to honeymoon in Hawaii. However, the night before they are due to depart, Luka receives a phone call from Croatia informing him that his father is ill, so the honeymoon is put on hold until Luka can return from his urgent trip abroad. After Luka&#x27;s departure, Abby has a tough time with the stern new ER Chief Kevin Moretti (Stanley Tucci), who plans to mold the department into a more efficient and professional work environment, but Moretti quickly tells Abby he is very impressed with her work. Despite this, she seems to dislike him more than many of the other residents. In season 14, Abby is struggling to deal with Luka&#x27;s absence, raise Joe and work at the ER; in &quot;Gravity&quot;, Joe is injured after falling off a jungle gym at the playground and Abby ends up relapsing at the episode&#x27;s end. She approaches Dr. Janet Coburn (the O.B. Chief) who appears to have been her AA sponsor in the past. Abby&#x27;s drinking problem continues to escalate, and she realizes how bad it is in &quot;Blackout&quot; when she shows up drunk to a party in honor of Pratt and Morris passing their boards. Abby finds herself waking up at 3am in Moretti&#x27;s apartment realizing, after sobering up at the airport when trying to find a flight to Croatia to see Luka, that she slept with him.

Soon after Luka arrives back in Chicago, he gets news that his father has died. Abby tells Luka to take Joe to Croatia for the funeral while she seeks help for her alcoholism- though she does not initially reveal the infidelity that her blackout caused. Upon her return to the ER, Abby faces the reality of her situation; she must tell her co-workers the truth about her disease. The only negative reaction at work is from Sam (Linda Cardellini), who displays disgust at Abby&#x27;s weakness, but the two women mend fences when Sam tells Abby she was being harsh because of her own long history of being around alcoholics who refused to clean up their lives. Abby goes to Croatia and confesses her blackout and subsequent actions to Luka. Luka is angry that she cheated on him and put their son&#x27;s life in danger. When they return to the States, he decides to move out of the apartment, though he does not seek separation or divorce papers. He decides to work at a long-term care facility and soon has a change of heart about Abby&#x27;s mistake, especially after a tense conversation with Dr. Moretti. Moretti also attempts to apologize to Abby, but she coldly rebuffs him. At the conclusion of the 14th season, it would appear that Abby and Luka are willing to continue to work on their marriage, with Luka forgiving Abby with a kiss. Abby&#x27;s happiness at this is tempered when the ambulance she walks past explodes, jarring her and mortally wounding her friend and colleague Dr. Gregory Pratt.

At the beginning of the 15th season, we learn that Abby has sought a position at a hospital in Boston where she and Luka plan to move with their son for a new start. In the third episode, Abby&#x27;s secret that she has accepted the job and resigned from County is slowly revealed to the others in the ER, although Abby asks them to keep it secret because she does not want it to be a big deal. Long-serving nurse Haleh Adams shows the departing Abby a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees have put their locker name tags. Abby then adds both hers and Luka&#x27;s tags to the wall. Abby finally leaves, saying goodbye to most of the staff who are gathered in the ambulance bay. She is picked up by Luka who has arrived in his car with their son.

== Career as a doctor ==
In 2003, Abby starts her final year of medical school and newcomer Samantha Taggart replaces her as the central nurse character on the show. As both a nurse and later a doctor, Abby has a tendency for sarcasm towards troublesome patients (and her co-workers), but she exudes gentleness and security as well. Although she is not as intellectually gifted as Neela Rasgotra, John Carter, or Gregg Pratt, she has many years of experience and one of the highest patient-satisfaction scores. It is a mark of Kerry Weaver&#x27;s confidence in Abby that, when she has her hip-replacement surgery in Season 12, she asks Abby to be her son Henry&#x27;s legal guardian if something happens to her. Towards the end of her final quarter of medical school, she is told that someone has anonymously paid off the balance on her tuition. She later discovers it was Carter. Abby goes on to graduate from medical school and finally becomes Dr. Abby Lockhart. By season 14, Abby is a fourth-year resident. She applies for an Attending position at County when she becomes frustrated by the endless delays and interviews for a position at an upscale medical facility, although this is partly because she wants to keep her options open if Luka decides to reconcile with her. She gets the other position, but Dr. Pratt uses his pull to get County to offer her the Attending position, which she accepts, one episode before Luka decides to forgive her.

After leaving with Luka to work in Boston, Abby appears once more in season 15 episode 20, &quot;Shifting Equilibrium&quot;, during a phone call with Neela, who needs Abby&#x27;s encouragement to leave County. Abby is seen in her new home looking after a group of young children for her after-shift daycare, including a three-year-old Joe.

<text>Pescado Rabioso (Rabid Fish) was an Argentine rock band led by musician Luis Alberto Spinetta from 1971 to 1973. Initially a trio accompanied by drummer Black Amaya and bassist Osvaldo &quot;Bocón&quot; Frascino, it became a quartet with the addition of keyboardist Carlos Cutaia. Finally, David Lebón replaced Frascino in 1972 and featured on the album &quot;Pescado 2&quot;.

In spite of its short life, Pescado Rabioso is still considered an important and influential piece of Argentine rock history. It was the second major band of Spinetta, created after Almendra&#x27;s break up in the late 1960s and a seven-month trip through Brazil, United States and Europe.

Although labeled under the band&#x27;s name due to legal terms with his record company, Pescado Rabioso&#x27;s final album &quot;Artaud&quot; is actually a complete solo effort from Spinetta.

<text>Two Buttes is a dual-peaked mountain in Prowers County, Colorado. The two peaks, which are the highest point in Prowers County, rise about above the mostly flat Great Plains that surround them, making them visible for miles. The south peak is about higher than the north one, and both are connected by a saddle.

The peaks, on private land, are located just north of the Two Buttes Reservoir State Wildlife Area, located across the border in Baca County just to the south. They are located just east of Highway 385/287. The town of Two Buttes is also located in Baca County, to the south of the peaks.

<doc id="1093723" wikidata="Q2973490" url="?curid=1093723" title="Division of Casey">
<text>The Division of Casey is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. The division was created in 1969 and is named for Richard Casey, who was Governor-General of Australia 1965–69.

The division is located in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne and extends into the Yarra Valley and Dandenong Ranges. It covers an area of approximately . Major suburbs and towns include , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .

The current Member for Casey, since the 2022 federal election, is Aaron Violi, a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. His immediate predecessor is Tony Smith, who was Speaker of the House from 2015 through 2021, and was, after Bob Halverson, the second member for this electorate to occupy the chair.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

When it was created it was a highly marginal seat, and at the 1972 federal election it was regarded as the &quot; seat&quot;, which the Australian Labor Party had to win to gain government. Lost when the Liberals won in 1975, Labor picked it up again when Labor regained government in 1983. However, a redistribution ahead of the following year&#x27;s election made Casey marginally Liberal. The Liberals retook the seat in that election and have held it since then. Demographic changes have also contributed in making Casey a fairly safe seat for the Liberal Party, although a redistribution ahead of the 2013 federal election pushed the seat further north into the upper Yarra Valley, estimated to halve the Liberal two-party preferred majority of 4.2 per cent.

Prominent members to have represented Casey include Peter Howson, who served as a minister in the McMahon government; Bob Halverson, who was Speaker of the House of Representatives 1996–98; Michael Wooldridge, who served as Minister for Health in the first five years of the Howard government (1996–2001); and Tony Smith, Speaker from 2015 until 2021.

<text>Merano (, ; ) or Meran () is a (municipality) in South Tyrol, Northern Italy. Generally best known for its spa resorts, it is located within a basin, surrounded by mountains standing up to above sea level, at the entrance to the Passeier Valley and the Vinschgau.

The city has been a popular place of residence for several scientists, literary people, and artists, including Franz Kafka, Paul Lazarsfeld and also Empress Elisabeth of Austria, who appreciated its mild climate.

==Name==
Both the Italian () and the German () names for the city are used in English. The Ladin form of the name is . The official name of the municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) is &quot;Comune di Merano&quot; in Italian and &quot;Stadtgemeinde Meran&quot; in German (both are in official use).

==History==
Archaic names of the city are &quot;Mairania&quot; (from AD 857) and &quot;an der Meran&quot; (from the 15th century). In 17th-century Latin, the city was called &quot;Meranum&quot;. 

===Origin===
The area has been inhabited since the third millennium BC, as shown by the presence of menhirs and other finds. The story of the city proper began in 15 BC when the Romans occupied the Adige valley founding a road station, &quot;Statio Maiensis&quot;.

The settlement was first mentioned in an 857 deed as &quot;Mairania&quot;. The Counts at Castle Tyrol elevated Merano to the status of a city during the 13th century and made it the capital of their County of Tyrol. After the county had been handed over to the Habsburg dynasty in 1363 upon the abdication of Margaret, Countess of Tyrol, in 1420 Duke Friedrich IV of Austria moved the Tyrolean court to Innsbruck. Though Merano remained the official capital until 1848, it subsequently lost its predominant position and almost all its importance as an economic hub across the roads connecting Italy and Germany. The important mint was also moved to Hall in Tirol in 1477.

===Modern history===
The Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809 against the French occupation drew attention again to Merano. In that year, on the Küchelberg above the city, a peasants&#x27; army eked out a victory against the united French and Bavarian forces before their revolt was finally crushed. After World War I, under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Merano became part of the Kingdom of Italy with the rest of the southern part of the former Cisleithanian crown land of Tyrol.

During the Nazi occupation of the region in 1943–5, the Meranese Jewish population was almost completely deported and murdered within concentration camps.

===Coat of arms===

The city&#x27;s coat of arms depicts the red Tyrolean eagle sitting on a wall with four pieces of Ghibelline battlements and three arches that symbolize the city. The arms is known from the 14th century and the oldest seal dates from 1353, while the coloured one since 1390. In a 1759 image, the eagle is represented with a crown and a green wreath of honour. After World War I and the annexation of the city from Austria-Hungary to Italy, it was given a new coat of arms in 1928, which looked similar to the old one, but with five parts of the battlements and the arches with the gates opened on a lawn of shamrock. A mural crown was placed above the shield. The five parts of the battlement represented the districts of Maia Bassa, Merano (old city), Maia Alta, Quarazze and Avelengo, which were incorporated into the city by the Italian fascists. After World War II, Avelengo became independent again and the historical coat of arms was restored.

==Main sights==

Among the city&#x27;s landmarks are the medieval city gates such as the &quot;Vinschgauer Tor&quot;, &quot;Passeirer Tor&quot;, and the &quot;Bozener Tor&quot;. Also belonging to the fortifications is the medieval Ortenstein tower, popularly called &quot;Pulverturm&quot; (lit. &quot;powder tower&quot;).

The main churches are the Gothic St. Nicholas&#x27; Church and the St. Barbara&#x27;s Chapel, both dating to the 15th century. Also dating to this period is the Princely Castle (&quot;Landesfürstliche Burg&quot;), which was a residence of Archduke Sigismund of Austria.

The &quot;Steinerner Steg&quot; stone bridge crosses the Passer river and dates to the 17th century.

The city saw further development as it became increasingly popular as a spa resort, especially after Empress Elisabeth of Austria started visiting. Dating from the 19th century are the Civic Theatre, the &quot;Kurhaus&quot; and the Empress Elisabeth Park. Also famous are the arched &quot;Wandelhalle&quot; promenades along the river.

After the annexation of the city by Italy in 1919, the Fascist authorities constructed the new city hall in the 1920s.

Outside the city is Trauttmansdorff Castle and its gardens. Located there is the Museum of Tourism, which was opened in the spring of 2003 and shows the historical development of tourism in the province. Tirol Castle is also close by.

==Climate==

Merano is on the borderline between several climates. Officially, it has an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;). However, it is close to being humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;) due to the mean temperature in July being just under 22 °C; even on those terms, the overnight lows in the winter bring the mean temperatures low enough for the city as a whole to have continental (&quot;Dfa/Dfb&quot;) influences with more distinct seasons.

The average daily temperatures in summer in Merano lie between 27 and 30 °C, while at night temperatures usually drop to between 12 and 15 °C. The average daily temperatures in winter lie between 6 and 10 °C, while at night temperatures usually drop to between -4 and -2 °C. The wettest month is August with 96 mm, while the driest is February with only 25 mm. This data was measured at the weather station Merano/Gratsch at an altitude of 333 metres between 1983 and 2017.

==Culture==
===Food===
The area is well known for its wines, both white and red, and vineyards extend right into the city. The local wine, &quot;Meraner Leiten (Meranese di collina)&quot;, is a light red wine, best drunk young. There are also extensive orchards, and apples are exported throughout Europe. The Forst Brewery on the edge of the city produces a popular range of beers, sold throughout Italy and Europe.

===Cultural events===

Merano organizes the following events every year.
* Asfaltart

<doc id="1093736" wikidata="Q355742" url="?curid=1093736" title="Ademir da Guia">
<text>Ademir da Guia (born 3 April 1942) is a retired professional footballer who played as a midfielder during the 1960s and 1970s for Palmeiras, a leading association football team in Brazil, where he is still regarded as one of the club&#x27;s all-time best players. Usually a playmaker, he was known for his fantastic close control and passing ability. He was nicknamed O Divino, which means The Divine One, the same nickname given to his father, Domingos da Guia.

==Personal life==

Da Guia was born in Rio de Janeiro. His father, Domingos da Guia was a former national team member who played at the 1938 FIFA World Cup. His uncle, Ladislau da Guia, had pursued the same career path at an earlier stage, playing for Bangu Atlético Clube, and becoming their all-time best scorer with 215 goals.

==Career==
In the 16 years Ademir da Guia spent playing for Palmeiras, he holds the record for the most appearances for the club and is the third best goalscorer ever, and won, amongst other titles, both the Campeonato Paulista and the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A five times.

Unlike many distinguished football players in his country, Ademir did not have a prolonged and constant participation with the Brazil national team; playing in nine matches for Brazil in the total, the first six in 1965 and the other three in 1974, including at the 1974 FIFA World Cup when he got the chance to play in the match for third place against Poland (in which Brazil was defeated by 1–0). His lack of playing time was the result of being contemporary of such players as Pelé, Rivellino, Gérson, Tostão, Dirceu Lopes and Paulo César.

Da Guia played his farewell match on 18 September 1977 at Estádio do Morumbi, São Paulo in a Campeonato Paulista match between his club Palmeiras and Corinthians, which the latter won 2–0.

==Political career==
He was elected in 2004 for the legislative period of 2005–2008 as councilman for the city of São Paulo as a member of the Communist Party of Brazil, joining the Liberal Party later.

<text>The Cloyne Court Hotel, often referred to simply as Cloyne, is a historical landmark in Berkeley, California and currently one of the houses of the Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC), a student housing cooperative. It is located at the north side of the University of California, Berkeley campus at 2600 Ridge Road, near Soda Hall and Jacobs Hall, and is the next door neighbor of the Goldman School of Public Policy.

The building is owned by the Regents of the University of California.

==History==
Cloyne Court was named after Cloyne, the village in Ireland where George Berkeley was bishop.

Cloyne was built in 1904 for $80,000 by the University Land and Improvement Company, which included several University professors, University benefactresses Phoebe Apperson Hearst and Jane K. Sather, future Regent James K. Moffit, Dr. Louis Lisser, John L. Howard, Warren Olney, Dr. Kasper Pishel, Louis Titus, John Galen Howard, the architect of the building and James M. Pierce, the later owner of the hotel. The building, described as a &quot;high-class, modern apartment house,&quot; originally contained 32 suites, each with bath, that were not connected by common hallways, but rather were paired onto private stairways to the first floor public areas. Each section was separated by heavy brick firewalls with automatic fireproof doors and each suite was wired for telephone. In 1911, the music room (today called lib-ed room) was added to the building, directly opposite the main entrance, which hosted numerous lectures and music recitals.

The building was one of a rare few to survive the devastating 1923 Berkeley fire, remarkable also because the building is made of redwood and all of the buildings had (and still have) wood shake siding and roofs.

Pierce and his family purchased the hotel from the investors and managed it from its opening in 1904 until 1914. The family continued operating the hotel until it was sold in 1946.

The services and hospitality at Cloyne Court were always highly complimented by the many visitors who had the pleasure of staying at the hotel. Registered compliments in the hotel guest book include:
*Cloyne Court - Silence and peace in an insane world. - Ernest Bloch, 1944
*Cloyne Court, a haven and a place where the gentle art of hospitality is made manifest to the unknown stranger as well as to the great ones of our day. - Mary Lambert, 1942
*Giving people a happy home is a divine service. - Benjamin Ide Wheeler, 1923
*I came a stranger, stayed a guest and departed a friend. - unknown

Cloyne Court was sold by the Pierce family in 1946 to the University Students&#x27; Cooperative Association (today BSC) for $125,000. That year, 15 men occupied the new co-op house alongside the previous residents, whom the USCA had agreed to not displace but rather to allow to continue to live in the residence. Cloyne originally housed all men who often held dances and dined with the women of nearby Stebbins Hall and Hoyt Hall, both all-female co-ops at the time. In 1972, Cloyne Court became a co-ed house.

In 1970, the USCA was forced to sell the property to the Regents of the University of California, upon the threat of an eminent domain acquisition by the University, in exchange for a peppercorn lease, most recently renewed in July 2005.

The building was named a City of Berkeley Landmark in 1982, and placed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

On December 21, 2008, Cloyne Court was closed temporarily for earthquake renovations. It reopened at the beginning of the Fall 2009 semester.

Cloyne&#x27;s reputation for its party and rules-free culture became a problem for the entire organization when in 2010 John Gibson, then a 21-year-old resident, suffered extensive brain damage and lapsed into a coma, reportedly as a result of a cocaine overdose, in his room. A lawsuit followed his hospitalization, his family claiming his fellow housemates failed to call 911 in time to assist him. The BSC settled with his family with the agreement that Cloyne would dramatically change. From Fall 2014, Cloyne became the substance-free house of the BSC system. Prior members were forced to leave, but one member was allowed to stay after appeal.

== Co-op ==
Cloyne is the largest non-apartment style property in the BSC, the largest housing co-op organization in North America. Cloyne houses 140 UC Berkeley students (119 during summer), mostly undergraduates. Because it is owned by, and leased on University of California land, only UC students are eligible as residents.

Despite its size the house is student-run and student-governed. Members contribute 5 hours of workshift per week each for various tasks needed for the operation of the house: cooking, cleaning, house maintenance, gardening, etc. Since July 2005, a facility manager employed by the students and the BSC lives on the premises to help with day-to-day operations of the house. Every weekday and on Sundays members cook a communal dinner, and on Saturdays there is a communal brunch. House&#x27;s council, house&#x27;s governing body where all members democratically make decisions pertaining the house, meets every Sunday.

As the academic theme house of the BSC system, Cloyne has an increased number of studious spaces and lectures, including study rooms, a library, a makerspace/hackerspace (a rare case where members can both hack and live in the same building), and many lectures given by guest lecturers and members themselves. A common practice is also informal visits of UC Berkeley professors at communal dinners, allowing members to get to know them through a less formal setting. An example of a UC Berkeley faculty member visiting Cloyne is popular EECS professor John DeNero, who regularly presented about the joys of data for many semesters.

The house is known for its murals covering many of its internal walls. Murals have been made through years by members residing in the house.

===Music scene===
Cloyne has played a notable role in the Bay Area music scene. The bands No Doubt, Elliott Smith, Green Day, Operation Ivy, The Offspring, Rancid, Primus, 24-7 Spyz, Save Ferris, Skankin&#x27; Pickle, The Mr. T Experience, Two Gallants, Blüchunks and Rilo Kiley played at Cloyne before becoming well known. The house also hosted several lesser-known bands during its many events, presenting as many as a dozen bands in a single evening, commonly using two separate stages, though sometimes as many as four: the dining room, the lib-ed room, the basement, and the courtyard.

<doc id="1093768" wikidata="Q256845" url="?curid=1093768" title="Electron-beam lithography">
<text>Electron-beam lithography (often abbreviated as e-beam lithography or EBL) is the practice of scanning a focused beam of electrons to draw custom shapes on a surface covered with an electron-sensitive film called a resist (exposing). The electron beam changes the solubility of the resist, enabling selective removal of either the exposed or non-exposed regions of the resist by immersing it in a solvent (developing). The purpose, as with photolithography, is to create very small structures in the resist that can subsequently be transferred to the substrate material, often by etching.

The primary advantage of electron-beam lithography is that it can draw custom patterns (direct-write) with sub-10 nm resolution. This form of maskless lithography has high resolution but low throughput, limiting its usage to photomask fabrication, low-volume production of semiconductor devices, and research and development.

==Systems==
Electron-beam lithography systems used in commercial applications are dedicated e-beam writing systems that are very expensive (&gt; US$1M). For research applications, it is very common to convert an electron microscope into an electron beam lithography system using relatively low cost accessories (&lt; US$100K). Such converted systems have produced linewidths of ~20 nm since at least 1990, while current dedicated systems have produced linewidths on the order of 10 nm or smaller.

Electron-beam lithography systems can be classified according to both beam shape and beam deflection strategy. Older systems used Gaussian-shaped beams that scanned these beams in a raster fashion. Newer systems use shaped beams that can be deflected to various positions in the writing field (also known as vector scan).

===Electron sources===
Lower-resolution systems can use thermionic sources (cathode), which are usually formed from lanthanum hexaboride. However, systems with higher-resolution requirements need to use field electron emission sources, such as heated W/ZrO2 for lower energy spread and enhanced brightness. Thermal field emission sources are preferred over cold emission sources, in spite of the former&#x27;s slightly larger beam size, because they offer better stability over typical writing times of several hours.

===Lenses===
Both electrostatic and magnetic lenses may be used. However, electrostatic lenses have more aberrations and so are not used for fine focusing. There is currently no mechanism to make achromatic electron beam lenses, so extremely narrow dispersions of the electron beam energy are needed for finest focusing.

===Stage, stitching and alignment===
Typically, for very small beam deflections, electrostatic deflection &quot;lenses&quot; are used; larger beam deflections require electromagnetic scanning. Because of the inaccuracy and because of the finite number of steps in the exposure grid, the writing field is of the order of 100 micrometre – 1 mm. Larger patterns require stage moves. An accurate stage is critical for stitching (tiling writing fields exactly against each other) and pattern overlay (aligning a pattern to a previously made one).

===Electron beam write time===

The minimum time to expose a given area for a given dose is given by the following formula:
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the time to expose the object (can be divided into exposure time/step size), formula_3 is the beam current, formula_4 is the dose and formula_5 is the area exposed.

For example, assuming an exposure area of 1 cm2, a dose of 10−3 coulombs/cm2, and a beam current of 10−9 amperes, the resulting minimum write time would be 106 seconds (about 12 days). This minimum write time does not include time for the stage to move back and forth, as well as time for the beam to be blanked (blocked from the wafer during deflection), as well as time for other possible beam corrections and adjustments in the middle of writing. To cover the 700 cm2 surface area of a 300 mm silicon wafer, the minimum write time would extend to 7*108 seconds, about 22 years. This is a factor of about 10 million times slower than current optical lithography tools. It is clear that throughput is a serious limitation for electron beam lithography, especially when writing dense patterns over a large area.

E-beam lithography is not suitable for high-volume manufacturing because of its limited throughput. The smaller field of electron beam writing makes for very slow pattern generation compared with photolithography (the current standard) because more exposure fields must be scanned to form the final pattern area (≤mm2 for electron beam vs. ≥40 mm2 for an optical mask projection scanner). The stage moves in between field scans. The electron beam field is small enough that a rastering or serpentine stage motion is needed to pattern a 26 mm X 33 mm area for example, whereas in a photolithography scanner only a one-dimensional motion of a 26 mm X 2 mm slit field would be required.

Currently an optical maskless lithography tool is much faster than an electron beam tool used at the same resolution for photomask patterning.

===Shot noise===
As features sizes shrink, the number of incident electrons at fixed dose also shrinks. As soon as the number reaches ~10000, shot noise effects become predominant, leading to substantial natural dose variation within a large feature population. With each successive process node, as the feature area is halved, the minimum dose must double to maintain the same noise level. Consequently, the tool throughput would be halved with each successive process node.
Note: 1 ppm of population is about 5 standard deviations away from the mean dose.

&quot;Ref.: SPIE Proc. 8683-36 (2013)&quot;

Shot noise is a significant consideration even for mask fabrication. For example, a commercial mask e-beam resist like FEP-171 would use doses less than 10 μC/cm2, whereas this leads to noticeable shot noise for a target critical dimension (CD) even on the order of ~200 nm on the mask. CD variation can be on the order of 15–20% for sub-20 nm features.

===Defects in electron-beam lithography===
Despite the high resolution of electron-beam lithography, the generation of defects during electron-beam lithography is often not considered by users. Defects may be classified into two categories: data-related defects, and physical defects.

Data-related defects may be classified further into two sub-categories. Blanking or deflection errors occur when the electron beam is not deflected properly when it is supposed to, while shaping errors occur in variable-shaped beam systems when the wrong shape is projected onto the sample. These errors can originate either from the electron optical control hardware or the input data that was taped out. As might be expected, larger data files are more susceptible to data-related defects.

Physical defects are more varied, and can include sample charging (either negative or positive), backscattering calculation errors, dose errors, fogging (long-range reflection of backscattered electrons), outgassing, contamination, beam drift and particles. Since the write time for electron beam lithography can easily exceed a day, &quot;randomly occurring&quot; defects are more likely to occur. Here again, larger data files can present more opportunities for defects.

Photomask defects largely originate during the electron beam lithography used for pattern definition.

==Electron energy deposition in matter==
The primary electrons in the incident beam lose energy upon entering a material through inelastic scattering or collisions with other electrons. In such a collision the momentum transfer from the incident electron to an atomic electron can be expressed as formula_6, where &quot;b&quot; is the distance of closest approach between the electrons, and &quot;v&quot; is the incident electron velocity. The energy transferred by the collision is given by formula_7, where &quot;m&quot; is the electron mass and &quot;E&quot; is the incident electron energy, given by formula_8. By integrating over all values of &quot;T&quot; between the lowest binding energy, &quot;E0&quot; and the incident energy, one obtains the result that the total cross section for collision is inversely proportional to the incident energy formula_9, and proportional to &quot;1/E0 – 1/E&quot;. Generally, &quot;E » E0&quot;, so the result is essentially inversely proportional to the binding energy.

By using the same integration approach, but over the range &quot;2E0&quot; to &quot;E&quot;, one obtains by comparing cross-sections that half of the inelastic collisions of the incident electrons produce electrons with kinetic energy greater than &quot;E0&quot;. These secondary electrons are capable of breaking bonds (with binding energy &quot;E0&quot;) at some distance away from the original collision. Additionally, they can generate additional, lower energy electrons, resulting in an electron cascade. Hence, it is important to recognize the significant contribution of secondary electrons to the spread of the energy deposition.

In general, for a molecule AB:

:e− + AB → AB− → A + B−

This reaction, also known as &quot;electron attachment&quot; or &quot;dissociative electron attachment&quot; is most likely to occur after the electron has essentially slowed to a halt, since it is easiest to capture at that point. The cross-section for electron attachment is inversely proportional to electron energy at high energies, but approaches a maximum limiting value at zero energy. On the other hand, it is already known that the mean free path at the lowest energies (few to several eV or less, where dissociative attachment is significant) is well over 10 nm, thus limiting the ability to consistently achieve resolution at this scale.

===Resolution capability===

With today&#x27;s electron optics, electron beam widths can routinely go down to a few nanometers. This is limited mainly by aberrations and space charge. However, the feature resolution limit is determined not by the beam size but by forward scattering (or effective beam broadening) in the resist, while the pitch resolution limit is determined by secondary electron travel in the resist. This point was driven home by a 2007 demonstration of double patterning using electron beam lithography in the fabrication of 15 nm half-pitch zone plates. Although a 15 nm feature was resolved, a 30 nm pitch was still difficult to do due to secondary electrons scattering from the adjacent feature. The use of double patterning allowed the spacing between features to be wide enough for the secondary electron scattering to be significantly reduced.

The forward scattering can be decreased by using higher energy electrons or thinner resist, but the generation of secondary electrons is inevitable. It is now recognized that for insulating materials like PMMA, low energy electrons can travel quite a far distance (several nm is possible). This is due to the fact that below the ionization potential the only energy loss mechanism is mainly through phonons and polarons. Although the latter is basically an ionic lattice effect, polaron hopping can extend as far as 20 nm. The travel distance of secondary electrons is not a fundamentally derived physical value, but a statistical parameter often determined from many experiments or Monte Carlo simulations down to &lt; 1 eV. This is necessary since the energy distribution of secondary electrons peaks well below 10 eV. Hence, the resolution limit is not usually cited as a well-fixed number as with an optical diffraction-limited system. Repeatability and control at the practical resolution limit often require considerations not related to image formation, e.g., resist development and intermolecular forces.

A study by the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE) presented at the 2013 EUVL Workshop indicated that, as a measure of electron blur, 50–100 eV electrons easily penetrated beyond 10 nm of resist thickness in PMMA or a commercial resist. Furthermore dielectric breakdown discharge is possible. More recent studies have indicated that 20 nm resist thickness could be penetrated by low energy electrons (of sufficient dose) and sub-20 nm half-pitch electron-beam lithography already required double patterning.

As of 2022, a state-of-the-art electron multi-beam writer achieves about a 20 nm resolution.

===Scattering===
In addition to producing secondary electrons, primary electrons from the incident beam with sufficient energy to penetrate the resist can be multiply scattered over large distances from underlying films and/or the substrate. This leads to exposure of areas at a significant distance from the desired exposure location. For thicker resists, as the primary electrons move forward, they have an increasing opportunity to scatter laterally from the beam-defined location. This scattering is called forward scattering. Sometimes the primary electrons are scattered at angles exceeding 90 degrees, i.e., they no longer advance further into the resist. These electrons are called backscattered electrons and have the same effect as long-range flare in optical projection systems. A large enough dose of backscattered electrons can lead to complete exposure of resist over an area much larger than defined by the beam spot.

===Proximity effect===
The smallest features produced by electron-beam lithography have generally been isolated features, as nested features exacerbate the proximity effect, whereby electrons from exposure of an adjacent region spill over into the exposure of the currently written feature, effectively enlarging its image, and reducing its contrast, i.e., difference between maximum and minimum intensity. Hence, nested feature resolution is harder to control. For most resists, it is difficult to go below 25 nm lines and spaces, and a limit of 20 nm lines and spaces has been found. In actuality, though, the range of secondary electron scattering is quite far, sometimes exceeding 100 nm, but becoming very significant below 30 nm.

The proximity effect is also manifest by secondary electrons leaving the top surface of the resist and then returning some tens of nanometers distance away.

Proximity effects (due to electron scattering) can be addressed by solving the inverse problem and calculating the exposure function &quot;E(x,y)&quot; that leads to a dose distribution as close as possible to the desired dose &quot;D(x,y)&quot; when convolved by the scattering distribution point spread function &quot;PSF(x,y)&quot;. However, it must be remembered that an error in the applied dose (e.g., from shot noise) would cause the proximity effect correction to fail.

==Charging==
Since electrons are charged particles, they tend to charge the substrate negatively unless they can quickly gain access to a path to ground. For a high-energy beam incident on a silicon wafer, virtually all the electrons stop in the wafer where they can follow a path to ground. However, for a quartz substrate such as a photomask, the embedded electrons will take a much longer time to move to ground. Often the negative charge acquired by a substrate can be compensated or even exceeded by a positive charge on the surface due to secondary electron emission into the vacuum. The presence of a thin conducting layer above or below the resist is generally of limited use for high energy (50 keV or more) electron beams, since most electrons pass through the layer into the substrate. The charge dissipation layer is generally useful only around or below 10 keV, since the resist is thinner and most of the electrons either stop in the resist or close to the conducting layer. However, they are of limited use due to their high sheet resistance, which can lead to ineffective grounding.

The range of low-energy secondary electrons (the largest component of the free electron population in the resist-substrate system) which can contribute to charging is not a fixed number but can vary from 0 to as high as 50 nm (see section New frontiers and extreme ultraviolet lithography). Hence, resist-substrate charging is not repeatable and is difficult to compensate consistently. Negative charging deflects the electron beam away from the charged area while positive charging deflects the electron beam toward the charged area.

==Electron-beam resist performance==
Due to the scission efficiency generally being an order of magnitude higher than the crosslinking efficiency, most polymers used for positive-tone electron-beam lithography will also crosslink (and therefore become negative tone) at doses an order of magnitude higher than the doses used to cause scission in the polymer for positive tone exposure. In the case of PMMA, exposure of electrons at up to more than 1000 μC/cm2, the gradation curve corresponds to the curve of a “normal” positive process. Above 2000 μC/cm2, the recombinant crosslinking process prevails, and at about 7000 μC/cm2 the layer is completely crosslinked which makes the layer more insoluble than the unexposed initial layer. If negative PMMA structures should be used, a stronger developer than for the positive process is required. Such large dose increases may be required to avoid shot noise effects.

A study performed at the Naval Research Laboratory indicated that low-energy (10–50 eV) electrons were able to damage ~30 nm thick PMMA films. The damage was manifest as a loss of material.

*For the popular electron-beam resist ZEP-520, a pitch resolution limit of 60 nm (30 nm lines and spaces), independent of thickness and beam energy, was found.
*A 20 nm resolution had also been demonstrated using a 3 nm 100 keV electron beam and PMMA resist. 20 nm unexposed gaps between exposed lines showed inadvertent exposure by secondary electrons.
*Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) is a negative tone resist that is capable of forming isolated 2-nm-wide lines and 10 nm periodic dot arrays (10 nm pitch) in very thin layers. HSQ itself is similar to porous, hydrogenated SiO2. It may be used to etch silicon but not silicon dioxide or other similar dielectrics.

In 2018, a thiol-ene resist was developed that features native reactive surface groups, which allows the direct functionalization of the resist surface with biomolecules.

==New frontiers==
To get around the secondary electron generation, it will be imperative to use low-energy electrons as the primary radiation to expose resist. Ideally, these electrons should have energies on the order of not much more than several eV in order to expose the resist without generating any secondary electrons, since they will not have sufficient excess energy. Such exposure has been demonstrated using a scanning tunneling microscope as the electron beam source. The data suggest that electrons with energies as low as 12 eV can penetrate 50 nm thick polymer resist. The drawback to using low energy electrons is that it is hard to prevent spreading of the electron beam in the resist. Low energy electron optical systems are also hard to design for high resolution. Coulomb inter-electron repulsion always becomes more severe for lower electron energy.

Another alternative in electron-beam lithography is to use extremely high electron energies (at least 100 keV) to essentially &quot;drill&quot; or sputter the material. This phenomenon has been observed frequently in transmission electron microscopy. However, this is a very inefficient process, due to the inefficient transfer of momentum from the electron beam to the material. As a result, it is a slow process, requiring much longer exposure times than conventional electron beam lithography. Also high energy beams always bring up the concern of substrate damage.

Interference lithography using electron beams is another possible path for patterning arrays with nanometer-scale periods. A key advantage of using electrons over photons in interferometry is the much shorter wavelength for the same energy.

Despite the various intricacies and subtleties of electron beam lithography at different energies, it remains the most practical way to concentrate the most energy into the smallest area.

There has been significant interest in the development of multiple electron beam approaches to lithography in order to increase throughput. This work has been supported by SEMATECH and start-up companies such as Multibeam Corporation, Mapper and IMS. IMS Nanofabrication has commercialized the multibeam-maskwriter and started a rollout in 2016.

<text>Mitchell Froom (born June 29, 1953) is an American musician and record producer. He was a member of the bands Gamma and Latin Playboys, and is currently the keyboardist for Crowded House. He has produced albums for several artists, including Richard Thompson, Los Lobos, Suzanne Vega, and Vonda Shepard.

==Career==
Froom began his career as a keyboard player in Sonoma County, California. The band Crossfire featured two keyboard players; Mitchell on one side of the stage and brother David on the other with Gary Pihl on guitar. He also played keyboards on the Ronnie Montrose-led group Gamma&#x27;s third album &quot;Gamma 3&quot;, as well as &quot;It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&#x27;s&quot; David LaFlamme&#x27;s 1978 solo album &quot;Inside Out&quot;.

He produced the first three Crowded House albums, which led to more production jobs with Richard Thompson, Los Lobos, American Music Club, Suzanne Vega and Paul McCartney. In 1982, Froom scored the adult film &quot;Café Flesh&quot;; his soundtrack was later released as the album &quot;Key of Cool&quot;. In the late 1980s, Crowded House leader Neil Finn invited Froom to join the band as an official member, but Froom declined due to his producing career.

In 1987 he produced and wrote incidental music for the neo-noir film &quot;Slam Dance&quot;.

Between 1992 and 2002 Froom formed a full-time partnership with engineer Tchad Blake. Production credits include albums from American Music Club, Stevie Ann, Tasmin Archer, The Bangles, Peter Case, The Corrs, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow, Crowded House, The Ditty Bops, Tim Finn, Missy Higgins, Indigo Girls, Los Lobos, Robin Gibb, Maria McKee, Pat McLaughlin, Randy Newman, Nerina Pallot, Pearl Jam, Phantom Planet, Bonnie Pink, Daniel Powter, Bonnie Raitt, Ron Sexsmith, The Del Fuegos, Richard Thompson, and Suzanne Vega. Froom and Blake joined with David Hidalgo and Louie Perez of Los Lobos to form the experimental roots collaboration Latin Playboys.

Froom has produced over 60 albums
and has composed and produced music for numerous films. He has been nominated for several Grammys including for Record of the Year for &quot;La Bamba&quot; by Los Lobos (1988) and Producer of the Year in 1993 for both &quot;Kiko&quot; by Los Lobos and by Suzanne Vega. He was also nominated for the 1998 Golden Globe Award and the 1999 Grammy for 
Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media
for co-writing with Sheryl Crow the James Bond movie title song &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;.

As a musician, Froom has released two solo albums, &quot;Dopamine&quot; (1998) and &quot;A Thousand Days&quot; (2005). The song &quot;Noodletown&quot; from &quot;Dopamine&quot; won an Emmy when it was used as the theme for PBS&#x27; &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot;.

Froom was a judge for the 2nd annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

In December 2019 Froom was announced as a member of the new lineup of Crowded House. The first album with this lineup, &quot;Dreamers Are Waiting&quot;, was released on June 4, 2021.

==Personal life==
Froom is of Romanian ancestry. His brother was David Froom, a classical composer and Department Chair of the Music Department at St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland.

His first wife was Connie Jester, with whom he had a daughter Charlotte Froom (born 1986). Charlotte was the bassist in The Like.

Froom married Suzanne Vega in 1995; they separated and divorced in 1998. Soul Coughing&#x27;s 1994 album, &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot;, was named after their daughter, Ruby Froom (born July 8, 1994).

He married Vonda Shepard in 2004. They have a son, Jack Froom (April 15, 2006), named for Froom&#x27;s late father, a physician and educator.

<text>&quot;The First Nowell&quot; (or Nowel), modernised as &quot;The First Noel&quot; (or Noël), is a traditional English Christmas carol with Cornish origins most likely from the early modern period, although possibly earlier. It is listed as number 682 in the Roud Folk Song Index.

==Origin and history==
&quot;The First Nowell&quot; is of Cornish origin. Its current form was first published in &quot;Carols Ancient and Modern&quot; (1823) and &quot;Gilbert and Sandys Carols&quot; (1833), both of which were edited by William Sandys and arranged and edited by Davies Gilbert (who also wrote extra lyrics) for &quot;Hymns and Carols of God&quot;.

&quot;Nowell&quot; is an Early Modern English synonym of &quot;Christmas&quot; from French &quot;Noël&quot;, &quot;the Christmas season&quot;, ultimately from Latin &quot;natalis [dies]&quot; &quot;[day] of birth&quot;. The word was regularly used in the burden of carols in the Middle Ages towards the early modern period; Sir Christèmas (Ritson Manuscript), &quot;Nowell sing we now all and some&quot; (Trinity Carol Roll) and &quot;Nowel – out of youre slepe arise and wake&quot; (Selden Carol Book) being 15th century examples. As a result, the word also came to be used to mean a Christmas song or carol.

The melody is unusual among English folk melodies in that it consists of one musical phrase repeated twice, followed by a refrain which is a variation on that phrase. All three phrases end on the third of the scale. Writing in the &quot;Journal of the Folk-Song Society&quot; in 1915, Anne Gilchrist notes it was not recorded prior to Sandys&#x27; publication. She speculated based on a set of church gallery parts discovered in Westmorland that the tune may have had its origin as a treble part to another carol &quot;Hark, hark what news the angels bring&quot;; her suggestion was that the treble part was passed down orally and was later remembered as the melody rather than a harmony. A conjectural reconstruction of this earlier version can be found in &quot;The New Oxford Book of Carols&quot;.

Today, &quot;The First Nowell&quot; is usually performed in a four-part hymn arrangement by the English composer John Stainer, first published in his &quot;Carols, New and Old&quot; in 1871. Variations of its theme are included in Victor Hely-Hutchinson&#x27;s &quot;Carol Symphony&quot;.

American folklorist James Madison Carpenter made audio recordings of several traditional versions of the song in Cornwall in the early 1930s, which can be heard online via the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library.

==Textual comparison==
In common with many traditional songs and carols, the lyrics vary across books. The versions compared below are taken from &quot;The New English Hymnal&quot; (1986) (which is the version used in Henry Ramsden Bramley and John Stainer&#x27;s &quot;Carols, New and Old&quot;), Ralph Dunstan&#x27;s gallery version in the &quot;Cornish Songbook&quot; (1929) and Reverend Charles Lewis Hutchins&#x27;s version in &quot;Carols Old and Carols New&quot; (1916).

The annunciation to the shepherds and the adoration of the shepherds are episodes in the nativity of Jesus described in the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke (Luke 2). The Star of Bethlehem appears in the story of the Magi (the Wise Men) in the Gospel of Matthew; it does not appear in the story of the shepherds.

<doc id="1093779" wikidata="Q45021" url="?curid=1093779" title="Long After Dark">
<text>Long After Dark is the fifth studio album by American rock band Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, released on November 2, 1982, on Backstreet Records. Notable for the MTV hit &quot;You Got Lucky&quot;, the album was also the band&#x27;s first to feature Howie Epstein on bass and harmony vocals. Epstein&#x27;s vocals are prevalent throughout the album and from that point on, became an integral part of the Heartbreakers&#x27; sound.

Two other singles from the album were released, &quot;Change of Heart&quot; and &quot;Straight into Darkness&quot;, the former joining &quot;You Got Lucky&quot; in the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 40. In July 2018, &quot;Keep a Little Soul&quot;, an outtake from &quot;Long After Dark&quot;, was released as the first single to promote Petty&#x27;s box set &quot;An American Treasure&quot;. &quot;Keeping Me Alive&quot;, another outtake from the album sessions, was a Petty favorite, and was eventually released on his and the Heartbreakers&#x27; 1995 box set &quot;Playback&quot;, as well as on &quot;An American Treasure&quot;.

On August 30, 2024, the Tom Petty estate announced the release of an expanded Deluxe Edition of the album, which included 12 new live and previously unreleased songs, as well as a Blu-Ray Dolby Atmos remix. This version was released on streaming services, numbered vinyl and CD on October 18, 2024.

<doc id="1093780" wikidata="Q217329" url="?curid=1093780" title="Turbot">
<text>The turbot (English: , French: .; &quot;Scophthalmus maximus&quot;) is a relatively large species of flatfish in the family Scophthalmidae. It is a demersal fish native to marine or brackish waters of the Northeast Atlantic, Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. It is an important food fish. Turbot in the Black Sea were often included in this species, but are now generally regarded as separate - the Black Sea turbot or kalkan (&quot;S. maeoticus&quot;). True turbot are not found in the Northwest Atlantic; the &quot;turbot&quot; of that region, which was involved in the so-called &quot;Turbot War&quot; between Canada and Spain, is the Greenland halibut or Greenland turbot (&quot;Reinhardtius hippoglossoides&quot;).

==Etymology==

The word comes from the Old French , which may be a derivative of the Latin (&#x27;spinning top&#x27;), a possible reference to its shape. Another possible origin of the Old French word is from Old Swedish , from &#x27;thorn&#x27; + &#x27;stump, butt, flatfish&#x27;, which may also be a reference to its shape (compare native English halibut). Early reference to the turbot can be found in a satirical poem (&quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Fish&quot;) by Juvenal, a Roman poet of the late 1st and early 2nd centuries AD, suggesting this fish was a delicacy in the Roman empire.

==Description==
The turbot is a large left eyed flatfish found primarily close to shore in sandy shallow waters throughout the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the North Atlantic. The European turbot has an asymmetric disk-shaped body, and has been known to grow up to long and in weight.

==Fisheries==
Turbot is highly prized as a food fish for its delicate flavour, and is also known as , breet, britt, or butt. It is a valuable commercial species, acquired through aquaculture and trawling. Turbot are farmed in Bulgaria, Canada, France, Spain, Portugal, Romania, Turkey, Chile, Norway, and China.
Turbot has a bright white flesh that retains this appearance when cooked. Like all flatfish, turbot yields four fillets with meatier topside portions that may be baked, poached, steamed, or pan-fried.

<text>Coast Capital Savings Federal Credit Union (formerly Coast Capital Savings Credit Union) is a member-owned financial co-operative headquartered in Surrey, British Columbia. It has nearly 600,000 members through its 45-location branch network. In 2023, Coast Capital&#x27;s net income was at $58.5 million. and has branches located in British Columbia, including Metro Vancouver, Fraser Valley, Okanagan and Vancouver Island regions.

== History ==
Concerned about the uncertain financial future following the Great Depression, when money was hard to come by, groups of individuals on B.C.&#x27;s Vancouver Island, neighbouring Gulf Islands, and the Greater Vancouver cities of Richmond and Surrey formed small financial co-ops focused on helping their neighbours and colleagues obtain the financial assistance they required to better their lives.

Coast Capital Savings Credit Union was created out of a merger on December 31, 2000 between Pacific Coast Savings Credit Union and Richmond Savings Credit Union. At the time, the merged entity&#x27;s $3.2 billion in assets made it the second largest credit union in Canada behind Vancity&#x27;s $6.4 billion. In June 2002, Coast Capital Savings acquired Surrey Metro Savings, expanding the reach of the credit union from Vancouver Island to the Fraser Valley.

In the years that followed the merger with Surrey Metro Savings, Coast Capital Savings membership grew from 300,000 members in 2002 to nearly 600,000 members in 2021. The asset base of the credit union increased from $6.1 billion to over $22 billion between 2002 and 2023.

From October 17 to November 28, 2016, a vote was held for members on whether Coast Capital Savings should become a federal credit union. 79.2% of the 79,726 voting members voted in favour, with the announcement coming from a Special General Meeting held on December 14, 2016. Coast Capital Savings is the second federal credit union, after New Brunswick&#x27;s Fédération des caisses populaires acadiennes (UNI) in July 2016. Pursuant to a federal letters patent, Coast Capital was renamed Coast Capital Savings Federal Credit Union (and in French &quot;Coopérative de crédit fédérale Coast Capital Savings&quot;) effective November 1, 2018. 

In June 2018, Coast Capital became a Certified B Corporation and successfully recertified in late 2021. Coast Capital earned an overall score of 112.8 in 2021, an 11.9 point increase over its 2018 result. In March 2022, Coast Capital ranked in the platinum category of the 2022 Corporate Knight’s Social Purpose Ranking.

<doc id="1093793" wikidata="Q145065" url="?curid=1093793" title="Lyudmila Pavlichenko">
<text>Lyudmila Mikhailovna Pavlichenko (; , ; 10 October 1974) was a Soviet sniper in the Red Army during World War II. She is credited with killing 309 enemy combatants. She served in the Red Army during the siege of Odessa and the siege of Sevastopol, during the early stages of the fighting on the Eastern Front.

Her score of 309 kills likely places her within the top five snipers of all time, but her kills may be significantly more numerous, as a confirmed kill has to be witnessed by a third party.

After she was injured in battle by a mortar shell, she was evacuated to Moscow. After she recovered from her injuries, she trained other Red Army snipers and was a public spokeswoman for the Red Army. In 1942, she toured the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. After the war ended in 1945, she was reassigned as a senior researcher for the Soviet Navy. She died of a stroke at the age of 58.

== Early life and education ==

Lyudmila Belova was born in Bila Tserkva, Kiev Governorate, in the Russian Empire (now in Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine) on , to Mikhail Belov, a locksmith from Petrograd, and his wife Elena Trofimovna Belova (1897–1972).
The family moved to Kiev when Lyudmila was aged 14. Her father was a Communist Party member, and had served as a regimental commissar in the Red Army, being awarded the Order of the Red Banner.

As a child, Lyudmila was a self-described tomboy, who was fiercely competitive at athletic activities. In Kiev, she joined an OSOAVIAKhIM shooting club, developed into an amateur sharpshooter and earned her Voroshilov Sharpshooter badge and a marksman certificate.

In 1932, she married Alexei Pavlichenko, and gave birth to a son, Rostislav (1932–2007). However, the marriage was soon dissolved, and Lyudmila returned to live with her parents.
She attended night school as well as performing household chores. During the day, she worked as a grinder at the Kiev Arsenal factory.

She enrolled at Kiev University in 1937, where she studied history and intended to be a scholar and teacher. There, she competed on the university&#x27;s track team as a sprinter and pole vaulter. She was also enrolled in a military-style sniping school for six months by the Red Army.

== World War II ==
In June 1941, Pavlichenko was aged 25 in her fourth year studying history at Kiev University when Nazi Germany began its invasion of the Soviet Union. Pavlichenko was among the first round of volunteers at the Odessa recruiting office, where she requested to join the infantry.

The registrar pushed Pavlichenko to be a nurse, but she refused. After seeing that she had completed multiple training courses, she was finally accepted into the army as a sniper and assigned to the Red Army&#x27;s 25th Rifle Division. There, she became one of 2,000 female snipers in the Red Army, of whom about 500 survived the war. She was initially assigned to digging trenches and communication routes, armed with a single RGD-33 grenade due to weapons shortages. In the second half of July 1941, a comrade was severely injured by shrapnel and handed her his Mosin–Nagant model 1891 bolt-action rifle. On 8 August 1941 Lyudmila experienced her debut as a wartime sniper when she killed two Nazi officers in Biliaivka at a distance of 400 metres.

Pavlichenko fought for about months during the Siege of Odessa and is credited with killing 187 soldiers. She was promoted to senior sergeant in August 1941, when she added 100 more kills to her official tally. At 25, she married a fellow sniper, Alexei Kitsenko. Soon after the marriage, Kitsenko was mortally wounded by a mortar shell and died from his injuries a few days later in the hospital.

When the Nazis and their Romanian allies overran Odessa on 15 October 1941, her unit was withdrawn by sea to Sevastopol, on the Crimean Peninsula, to fight in the siege of Sevastopol. There, she trained other snipers, who were credited with killing over 100 Axis soldiers during the battle. In May 1942, newly promoted Lieutenant Pavlichenko was cited by the Southern Army Council for killing 257 Axis soldiers. The number of soldiers Pavlichenko is credited with killing during World War II was 309, including 36 Axis snipers.

In June 1942, Pavlichenko was hit in the face with shrapnel from a mortar shell. When she was injured, the Soviet High Command ordered for her to be evacuated from Sevastopol via submarine.

She spent around a month in the hospital. Once she had recovered from her injuries, instead of being sent back to the front, she became a propagandist for the Red Army, where she was nicknamed &quot;Lady Death.&quot; (The Germans called her &quot;the Russian bitch from hell.&quot;)
She also trained snipers for combat duty until the end of the war in 1945.

== Visits to Allied countries ==
In 1942, Pavlichenko was sent to Canada and the United States for a publicity visit as part of the Soviet Union&#x27;s attempts to convince the other Allies of World War II to open a second front against Nazi Germany. When she visited the United States, she became the first Soviet citizen to be received by a US president, as Franklin D. Roosevelt welcomed her to the White House. Pavlichenko was later invited by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to tour the US, relating her experiences as a female soldier on the front lines.

During the publicity tour, Pavlichenko was not taken seriously by the press and was referred to as the &quot;Girl Sniper.&quot; Not cut out to be a diplomat, she was shy and said she just wanted to kill fascists. When meeting with reporters in Washington, D.C., she was dumbfounded by the kind of questions put to her. &quot;One reporter even criticized the length of the skirt of my uniform, saying that in America women wear shorter skirts and besides my uniform made me look fat.&quot; They also asked if she used makeup on the front line. She challenged an especially sexist reporter to a fistfight. She responded to a question about her underwear so:&quot;I am proud to wear the uniform of the legendary Red Army. It has been sanctified by the blood of my comrades who&#x27;ve fallen in combat with the fascists.&quot;She was described by the reporters as very blunt and unemotional in her responses.

Pavlichenko appeared before the International Student Assembly being held in Washington, DC, attended the meetings of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and made appearances and speeches in New York City and Chicago. In New York City, she was given a raccoon fur coat by Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. In Chicago, she stood before large crowds, chiding the men to support a second front. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; she said, &quot;I am 26 years old and I have killed 309 fascist invaders by now. Don&#x27;t you think, gentlemen, that you have been hiding behind my back for too long?&quot; Her words settled on the crowd, then caused a surging roar of support. The United States government presented her with a Colt semi-automatic pistol.

In Toronto, Ontario, she was presented a Winchester Model 70 rifle equipped with a Weaver telescopic sight, now on display at the Central Armed Forces Museum in Moscow. While visiting Canada, along with fellow sniper Vladimir Pchelintsev and Moscow fuel commissioner Nikolai Kravchenko, she was greeted by thousands of people at Toronto&#x27;s Union Station.

On Friday 21 November 1942, Pavlichenko visited Coventry, England, accepting donations of £4,516 from local workers to pay for three X-ray units for the Red Army. She also visited the ruins of Coventry Cathedral, then the Alfred Herbert works and Standard Motor Factory, from where most funds had been raised. She had inspected a factory in Birmingham earlier in the day.

Having been made an officer, Pavlichenko never returned to combat, instead becoming an instructor and training snipers until the war&#x27;s end. In 1943, she was awarded the Gold Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union, as well as the Order of Lenin twice.

== Later life ==

When the war ended, Pavlichenko finished her education at Kiev University and began a career as a historian. From 1945 to 1953, she was a research assistant at Soviet Navy headquarters. She was later active in the Soviet Committee of the Veterans of War.

== Death and legacy ==

She died from a stroke on 10 October 1974 at 58 and was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Her son, Rostislav, is buried next to her.

A second Soviet commemorative stamp featuring her portrait was issued in 1976.

== In popular culture ==
The American folk singer Woody Guthrie composed a song (&quot;Miss Pavlichenko&quot;) as a tribute to her war record and to memorialize her visits to the United States and Canada. It was released as part of &quot;The Asch Recordings&quot;.

Pavlichenko was a subject of the 2015 film &quot;Battle for Sevastopol&quot; (original Russian title, &quot;Битва за Севастополь&quot;). A joint Russian-Ukrainian production, it was released in both countries on 2 April 2015. Its international premiere took place two weeks later at the Beijing International Film Festival. It is a heavily romanticized version of her life, with several fictitious characters and many departures from the events related in her memoirs.

The first English language edition of her memoirs, &quot;Lady Death&quot;, was published by Greenhill Books in February 2018. It has a foreword by Martin Pegler and is part of the Lionel Leventhal&#x27;s Greenhill Sniper Library series.

Pavlichenko&#x27;s experiences during World War II, both in battle and on tour in the United States, have inspired several historical fiction novels, including &quot;Beautiful Assassin&quot; (2010) and Kate Quinn&#x27;s 2022 novel &quot;The Diamond Eye&quot;.

<text>The City of Ember is a post-apocalyptic novel by Jeanne DuPrau that was published in 2003. The story is about Ember, a post-apocalyptic underground city threatened by aging infrastructure and corruption. The young protagonists, Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, follow clues left behind by the original builders of the City of Ember, to safety in the outside world.

It is the first book in the &quot;Books of Ember&quot; series, which also includes &quot;The People of Sparks&quot;, &quot;The Prophet of Yonwood&quot; (a prequel), and the final installment, &quot;The Diamond of Darkhold&quot;. In 2008, the book was adapted into a film by Walden Media and Playtone.

A graphic novel adaptation by comic book artist Niklas Asker was released on September 25, 2012.

==Plot summary==
As Earth is being ravaged by a series of apocalyptic events known as the Disaster, a coalition of architects, scientists, and doctors (called the Builders) create an underground city named Ember, with an initial population of 200 citizens (100 elderly adults, 100 babies), to ensure humanity survives, with the intention that future generations of the city will not know about the outside world or that they live underground. They build the city to last for two centuries, after which the citizens of Ember will evacuate and return to the surface world. The Builders give the first mayor of the city a box with a timed lock set to open after 200 years, containing instructions explaining how to leave Ember. The box is passed successfully from mayor to mayor, until the seventh mayor who, thinking it could contain a cure for the deadly coughing disease he contracted, takes the box home and tries multiple times to break it open, but fails. He then dies before he can return the box to its rightful place or inform the next mayor of its importance.

Approximately two hundred and forty-one years after Ember was established, the city&#x27;s supplies are in danger of exhaustion, and its hydroelectric generator is in decay, causing the power to go out intermittently. At their graduation ceremony, young people are assigned jobs by lottery: Lina Mayfleet is assigned the job of &quot;Pipeworks Laborer&quot; and Doon Harrow is given the job of &quot;Messenger&quot;. However, both are displeased with their assigned jobs so they exchange their assignments and begin work in their respective positions. It is revealed that the seventh mayor was Lina&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, and because of that, the box is actually in their own home. By now the timer has finished counting down and the lock has clicked open. When searching the closet, Lina&#x27;s grandmother finds the box but tosses it aside, not realizing its importance. The opened box is found by Lina&#x27;s baby sister, Poppy. When Lina comes home, she finds Poppy with torn pieces of paper in her hands and mouth. By the time Lina managed to get the paper from Poppy, they had already been mostly destroyed. After examining the paper, she decides that its contents had been written by the Builders due to its writing style. Using some glue, Lina reassembles the message as best she can. There are many gaps and some words make no sense, so it proves difficult for Lina to completely salvage the writing. With the help of her friend Doon and her late father&#x27;s friend Clary, she starts to piece together the writing. They discover that the title of this document is &quot;Instructions for Egress&quot;, and presume that the document must show the way out of Ember. After much trial and error, they eventually manage to decipher most of the document. The instructions lead to a hidden room built on the side of the river that flows underground throughout the city in the Pipeworks, an underground network of tunnels that carried the plumbing pipes of the city. The room contained hundreds of boats, matches, and candles to create portable light, something never successfully created in Ember. The builders meant for the citizens of Ember to board these boats and be carried down the river into the outside world.

Lina&#x27;s grandmother dies shortly after their discovery of the document, and Lina and Poppy move in with a neighbor, Mrs. Murdo. At work, Doon discovers that the mayor of Ember and a storeroom worker named Looper have been stealing supplies, and he and Lina report the crime to the guards, who unknown to them, are also corrupt. Instead of arresting the mayor, they learn that the guards have declared them criminals and there are notices everywhere with their names. Doon and Lina plan to escape Ember in the boats and agree to meet in the Pipeworks at a certain time, but just before, Lina is arrested and taken to the mayor, who plans to throw her in jail. Suddenly, a blackout occurs, allowing her to escape without being seen; she meets Doon in the Pipeworks with her sister Poppy in tow. Lina, Doon, and Poppy escape in a boat through the river, its current carrying them forward. When the boat stops, they learn the origin of Ember from a diary left by one of its original colonists. Shortly after they are faced with a very steep climb and emerge onto the surface. After exploring the above world, they find a tunnel with a steep drop into a cave. Below, they see Ember&#x27;s lights and realize they had lived underground for years. To alert the rest of the city about how to leave Ember, they throw a packet with a letter detailing the path to exit, down to the center of Ember. The packet is found by Mrs. Murdo on Harken Square.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The City of Ember&quot; was praised for its setting and main characters, Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; praised the characters, stating: &quot;The likable protagonists are not only courageous but also believably flawed by human pride, their weaknesses often complementing each other in interesting ways.&quot; Sally Estes from &quot;Booklist&quot; commented how readers would be able to connect to Lina and Doon&#x27;s courage amidst the conflicts. Robert Sutton from &quot;Horn Book Magazine&quot; compared the novel to &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; by Lois Lowry, noting how &quot;the darkness of Ember is essentially literal&quot; with the generator (the mechanical light operator) failing and running out of power, leading to frequent blackouts. Sutton noted how DuPrau does not explain the history of Ember all at once, which would confuse and overwhelm the reader and instead, &quot;allows the events of the story to convey the necessary information&quot;. Lina and Doon were described as &quot;good sorts&quot; that are &quot;deeply etched&quot;. Dian Roback from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; also praised the &quot;full blooded characters&quot; as every bit as good as the plot which would hook readers until the end. Although Jones Johns from &quot;School Library Journal&quot; wrote that the setting was not as ingenious as the ones in Joan Aiken&#x27;s &quot;Is&quot; and Lois Lowry&#x27;s &quot;The Giver&quot;, he said that the characters and pace of the plot would keep readers hooked.

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation of the novel, directed by Gil Kenan, was produced by Walden Media and Playtone with Bill Murray as the mayor, Saoirse Ronan as Lina, and Harry Treadaway as Doon. Filming was finished in October 2007, and the film was released in theaters a year later on October 10, 2008. &quot;City of Ember&quot; was released on DVD on January 20, 2009. The film received mixed reviews, with a Metacritic rating of 58/100, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

<text>Grappenhall is a village within the civil parish of Grappenhall and Thelwall in the Borough of Warrington in Cheshire, England. The parish had a population of 9,377 at the 2001 census, 9,687 at the 2011 census, and 9,651 at the 2021 census.

==History==
Grappenhall is first mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 with the name &quot;Gropenhale&quot; and with a valuation of five shillings.

St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church has a carving of a cat on the west face of the tower. This may have been Lewis Carroll&#x27;s inspiration for the grinning Cheshire Cat in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. The church itself was first constructed in 1120, though was rebuilt 400 years later. The church was also, at a time, in the possession of the Boidelle (Boydell) family.

Along with the church, the centre of the village contains two pubs, the Parr Arms and the Ram&#x27;s Head, and Grappenhall Hall Residential School (closed down) and St Wilfrid&#x27;s Primary School. Bradshaw Community Primary School is located north of the village centre.

On 1 April 1936 the parish of Thelwall was abolished and merged with Grappenhall, on 1 April 1974 the merged parish was renamed &quot;Grappenhall and Thelwall&quot;. In 1931 the parish of Grappenhall (prior to the merge) had a population of 2449.

==Leisure==
Grappenhall Heys Walled Garden is near the village.
Grappenhall is home to the 25th Warrington East (St Wilfred&#x27;s) Scout Troop. 

==Sport==
There is a cricket ground, which is the home of Grappenhall Cricket Club. Australian cricketer Steve Smith was signed for the club for five weeks in 2007, when he was 17.

==Library==
The Grappenhall Community library is a community-run library in the village. It was opened by the local authority in 1959 before being handed over to the Friends of Grappenhall Library after closure on 2 April 2011 due to local authority cuts. The library is run by the Friends of the Grappenhall library who pay £10 a year to help with its upkeep.

==In popular culture==
Parts of the &quot;Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot; were filmed in the centre of Grappenhall. The village name appears in the title of the song &quot;Grappenhall Rag&quot;, by the Darwen singer-songwriter Bryn Haworth.

==Notable people==
Grappenhall is the birthplace of actor and singer Tim Curry (born 19 April 1946).

<text>The of January 1914 involved collusion between several high-ranking members of the Imperial Japanese Navy, the British company Vickers, and the German industrial conglomerate of Siemens AG. It was one of several spectacular political scandals of late Meiji and Taishō period Japanese politics, leading to the fall of the cabinet of Yamamoto Gonnohyoe.

==Kickbacks in shipbuilding==
The Japanese navy engaged in a massive expansion program during the late Meiji period and early Taishō period. Many major orders of materiel (such as advanced warships and weaponry) were imported from Europe. Siemens had secured a virtual monopoly over Japanese naval contracts in return for a secret 15% kickback to the Japanese naval authorities responsible for procurement.

In 1914, the British firm of Vickers (via their Japanese agents Mitsui Bussan) offered the Japanese naval authorities a more lucrative deal, involving a 25% kickback, with 40,000 yen for Vice Admiral Matsumoto Kazu, the former Chief of the Navy Technical Department, specifically involving the procurement of the battlecruiser &quot;Kongō&quot;. When the German headquarters of Siemens found out about the deal, they sent a telegram to their Tokyo office demanding a clarification. An expatriate employee of the Siemens Tokyo office (Karl Richter) stole incriminating documents indicating that Siemens had previously paid a bribe of 1000 pounds sterling (~142,000 today) to the Japanese navy in return for a wireless contract, sold the documents to the Reuters news agency together with a copy of the telegram and fled back to Germany.

== Breaking of the scandal==
The London &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper edition of 21 January 1914 reported on the scandal, specifically the criminal proceedings against Karl Richter. Japanese newspapers, notably the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;, immediately reported the details of the corruption scandal, and the issue was raised in the Diet by members of the Rikken Doshikai political party. Both the Army and Navy Intelligence Services and the &quot;Kempeitai&quot; launched investigations.

Another newspaper, &quot;Japan Weekly Chronicle&quot;, reported that an Admiral Fuji (Fujii Terugoro) of the navy procurement office had confessed to receiving payments from Vickers of a total 210,000 yen in 1911 and 1912 on various occasions. It reminded its readers that whether or not the money was received illegally under Japanese law, it was certainly illegal under the British Prevention of Corruption Act, 1906.

Karl Richter was arrested in Germany for his theft of the incriminating papers, and sentenced to two years in prison. The head of the Siemens subsidiary in Japan, Hermann Kessler faced a public accusation in the German Reichstag by Karl Liebknecht, but was not charged.

==Japanese political fallout==
Large-scale demonstrations erupted in Tokyo in early February 1914, which turned violent on 10 February and 14 February. The largest protest drew some 50,000 attendees. The navy, backed by the Prime Minister Yamamoto, had earlier demanded a huge increase of 70 million yen for its budget, but this was so large that it would reduce the scope for a business tax reduction that had previously been expected and lobbied for. Public opinion was outraged. Although Prime Minister Yamamoto was not directly implicated in the bribery, public dissatisfaction with him continued to grow, and he was challenged to explain the bribery allegations before the House of Peers. Minister of the Navy Saito Makoto offered a reduced budget request of 30 million yen as a compromise, but this failed to stem the scandal.
After both houses of the Diet refused to pass the 1914 Navy budget, and with the cabinet facing a vote of censure in the lower house, Yamamoto resigned on 24 March 1914, bringing down his entire cabinet with him. Given that Yamamoto was also an officer of the Japanese Navy, a court martial demoted Yamamoto and Saito Makoto, both of whom had previously held the rank of Admiral. Subsequent courts martial sentenced several leading members of the navy procurement department to prison sentences, issued heavy fines to Vickers and Siemens, and banned both companies from future participation in contracts. Still, prosecutor-general Kiichirō Hiranuma declined to prosecute some of the navy officers alleged to be involved, perhaps due to fears of sullying the navy&#x27;s reputation too much.

Yamamoto&#x27;s cabinet was further damaged by influential politician Hara Takashi revoking his support. While Takashi expected his Rikken Seiyūkai politicial party to fill the resulting power vacuum, Ōkuma Shigenobu became the new prime minister instead.

<text>The Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada (APEC) was a group in Canada, which campaigned against the Canadian government&#x27;s policy of official bilingualism.

The group was formed in 1977 by Irene Hilchie, a government employee who felt that she was being discriminated against in her job because she did not speak French. The group&#x27;s most famous member, however, was Jock V. Andrew, whose book &quot;Bilingual Today, French Tomorrow&quot; alleged that bilingualism was part of a government plot to make Canada a unilingually French country.

The group was most influential in the late 1980s, as it engaged in activities which contributed to the defeat of the Meech Lake Accord. As well, the group was involved in a campaign to have Ontario municipalities declare themselves English-only, in response to the Ontario government&#x27;s &quot;French Language Services Act&quot;. While the act did not apply to municipal government services, APEC represented it as a slippery slope towards such a requirement to convince municipalities to pass English-only resolutions.

Most famously, the city of Sault Ste. Marie passed such a resolution on January 29, 1990. Quebec voters perceived the Sault Ste. Marie resolution and the Brockville flag incident as symbols of English Canada&#x27;s feelings toward Quebec, and the incidents contributed to the resurgence of the Quebec sovereignty movement in the 1990s and thus to the 1995 Quebec referendum.

APEC also worked closely with the Confederation of Regions Party and the Reform Party, two political parties which held similar views about bilingualism and the role of Quebec in Confederation.

APEC claims to be not anti-French, but believes that tax money was being wastefully used in the promotion of official bilingualism in Canada.

In February 2000, the organization moved its head office to Toronto, and changed its name to Canadians Against Bilingualism Injustice (CABI). In 2001, the organization changed its name again, becoming the Canadian Network for Language Awareness.

In the 2000 federal election, CABI spent just over $150,000 as a registered third party participant. Most of the funds were used to place advertisements in Ontario newspapers. No such participation has been recorded for subsequent elections.

For years, APEC / CABI owned the domain name www.bilingualism.org, but registration lapsed some time between 2000 and 2010.

<text>The scutum (; :&quot;scuta&quot;) was a type of shield used among Italic peoples in antiquity, most notably by the army of ancient Rome starting about the fourth century BC.

The Romans adopted it when they switched from the military formation of the hoplite phalanx of the Greeks to the formation with maniples (). In the former, the soldiers carried a round shield, which the Romans called a &quot;clipeus&quot;. In the latter, they used the &quot;scutum&quot;, which was larger. Originally, it was oblong and convex, but by the first century BC, it had developed into the rectangular, semi-cylindrical shield that is popularly associated with the &quot;scutum&quot; in modern times. This was not the only kind the Romans used; Roman shields were of varying types depending on the role of the soldier who carried it. Oval, circular and rectangular shapes were used throughout Roman history.

==History==

The first depictions of the scutum are by the Este culture in the 8th century BC, and subsequently spread to the Italians, Illyrians, and Celts. 

In the early days of ancient Rome (from the late regal period to the first part of the early republican period) Roman soldiers wore &quot;clipeus&quot;, which were like the (), smaller (than the scutum) round shields used in the Greek &quot;hoplite&quot; phalanx. The &quot;hoplites&quot; were heavy infantrymen who originally wore bronze shields and helmets. The phalanx was a compact, rectangular mass military formation. The soldiers lined up in very tight ranks in a formation that was eight lines deep. The phalanx advanced in unison, which encouraged cohesion among the troops. It formed a shield wall and a mass of spears pointing towards the enemy. Its compactness provided a thrusting force that had a great impact on the enemy and made frontal assaults against it very difficult. However, it worked only if the soldiers kept the formation tight and had the discipline needed to keep its compactness in the thick of the battle. It was a rigid form of fighting and its maneuverability was limited. The small shields provided less protection. However, their smaller size afforded more mobility. Their round shape enabled the soldiers to interlock them to hold the line together.

Sometime in the early fourth century BC, the Romans changed their military tactics from the &quot;hoplite&quot; phalanx to the &quot;manipular&quot; formation, which was much more flexible. This involved a change in military equipment. The &quot;scutum&quot; replaced the &quot;clipeus&quot;. Some ancient writers thought that the Romans had adopted the &quot;maniples&quot; and the &quot;scutum&quot; when they fought against the Samnites in the first or second Samnite War (343–341 BC, 327–304 BC). However, Livy did not mention the &quot;scutum&quot; being a Samnite shield and wrote that the oblong shield and the &quot;manipular&quot; formation were introduced in the early fourth century BC, before the conflicts between the Romans and the Samnites. Plutarch mentioned the use of the long shield in a battle that took place in 366 BC. Couissin notes archaeological evidence shows that the &quot;scutum&quot; was in general use among Italic peoples long before the Samnite Wars and argues that it was not obtained from the Samnites. In some parts of Italy the &quot;scutum&quot; had been used since pre-historical times.

Polybius gave a description of the early second-century scutum BC:

Roman rectangular scutums of later eras were smaller than Republican oval scutums and often varied in length from approximately tall (approximately 3 to 3.5 Roman feet, covering the shoulder to top of knee), and wide (approximately 2 to 2.7 Roman feet). 

The oval &quot;scutum&quot; is depicted on the Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus in Rome, the monument of Aemilius Paullus at Delphi, and there is an actual example found at Kasr el-Harit in Egypt. Gradually the &quot;scutum&quot; evolved into the rectangular (or sub-rectangular) type of the early Roman Empire.

By the end of the 3rd century the rectangular &quot;scutum&quot; seems to have disappeared. Fourth century archaeological finds (especially from the fortress of Dura-Europos) indicate the subsequent use of oval or round shields which were not semi-cylindrical but were either dished (bowl-shaped) or flat. Roman artwork from the end of the 3rd century until the end of Antiquity show soldiers wielding oval or round shields.

The word &quot;scutum&quot; survived the Fall of the Western Empire and remained in the military vocabulary of the Byzantine Empire. Even in the 11th century, the Byzantines called their armoured soldiers &quot;skutatoi&quot; (Grk. σκυτατοί), and several modern Romance languages use derivatives of the word.

==Structure==
The &quot;scutum&quot; was a 
large rectangle curved shield made from three sheets of wood glued together and covered with canvas and leather, usually with a spindle shaped boss along the vertical length of the shield.

The best surviving example, from Dura-Europos in Syria, was high, across, and deep (due to its semicylindrical nature). It is made from strips of wood that are 30 to 80 millimetres (1.2 to 3.1 in) wide and 1.5 to 2 millimetres (0.059 to 0.079 in) thick. They are put together in three layers, so that the total thickness of the wood layer is 4.5 to 6 millimetres (0.18 to 0.24 in). It was likely well made and extremely sturdy.

===Advantages and disadvantages===
The &quot;scutum&quot; was light enough to be held in one hand and its large height and width covered the entire wielder, making him very unlikely to be hit by missile fire and in hand-to-hand combat. The metal boss, or &quot;umbo&quot;, in the centre of the &quot;scutum&quot; also made it an auxiliary punching weapon. Its composite construction meant that early versions of the &quot;scutum&quot; could fail from a heavy cutting or piercing blow, which was experienced in the Roman campaigns against Carthage and Dacia where the &quot;falcata&quot; and &quot;falx&quot; could easily penetrate and rip through it. The effects of these weapons prompted design changes that made the &quot;scutum&quot; more resilient such as thicker planks and metal edges.

The &quot;aspis&quot;, which it replaced, provided less protective coverage than the &quot;scutum&quot; but was much more durable.

===Combat uses===
According to Polybius, the &quot;scutum&quot; gave Roman soldiers an edge over their Carthaginian enemies during the Punic Wars: 
&quot;Their arms also give the men both protection and confidence, which they owed to the size of the shield.&quot;

The Roman writer Suetonius recorded anecdotes of the heroic centurion Cassius Scaeva and legionary Gaius Acilius who fought under Caesar in the Battle of Dyrrachium and the battle of Massilia, respectively:

The Roman writer Cassius Dio in his &quot;Roman History&quot; described Roman against Roman in the Battle of Philippi: &quot;For a long time there was pushing of shield against shield and thrusting with the sword, as they were at first cautiously looking for a chance to wound others without being wounded themselves.&quot;

The shape of the &quot;scutum&quot; allowed packed formations of legionaries to overlap their shields to provide an effective barrier against projectiles. The most novel (and specialised, for it afforded negligible protection against other attacks) use was the &quot;testudo&quot; (Latin for &quot;tortoise&quot;), which added legionaries holding shields from above to protect against descending projectiles (such as arrows, spears, or objects thrown by defenders on walls).

Dio gives an account of a &quot;testudo&quot; put to good use by Marc Antony&#x27;s men while on campaign in Armenia:

However, the &quot;testudo&quot; was not invincible, as Dio also gives an account of a Roman shield array being defeated by Parthian knights and horse archers at the Battle of Carrhae:
===Special uses===
Cassius Dio describes &quot;scuta&quot; being used to aid an ambush:

Dio also notes the use of the &quot;scutum&quot; as a tool of psychological warfare during the capture of Syracuse:

In 27 BC, the emperor Augustus was awarded a golden shield by the senate for his part in ending the civil war and restoring the republic, according to the &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot;. The shield, the &quot;Res Gestae&quot; says, was hung outside the Curia Julia, serving as a symbol of the &quot;princeps&quot; &quot;valour, clemency, justice and piety&quot;.
The 5th century writer Vegetius added that &quot;scuta&quot; helped in identification:

==Other uses of the word==
The name Scutum has been adopted as one of the 88 modern constellations, and by UK luxury clothing maker Aquascutum, which became famous in the 19th century for its waterproof menswear. Hence the name, which in Latin means &quot;water shield&quot;.

In zoology, the term &quot;scute&quot; or &quot;scutum&quot; is used for a flat and hardened part of the anatomy of an animal, such as the shell of a turtle.

<doc id="1093855" wikidata="Q1728362" url="?curid=1093855" title="Capacitation">
<text>Capacitation is the penultimate step in the maturation of mammalian spermatozoa and is required to render them competent to fertilize an oocyte. This step is a biochemical event; the sperm move normally and look mature prior to capacitation.
&quot;&quot;, capacitation occurs after ejaculation, when the spermatozoa leave the vagina and enter the upper female reproductive tract. The uterus aids in the steps of capacitation by secreting sterol-binding albumin, lipoproteins, and proteolytic and glycosidasic enzymes such as heparin.

For purposes of &quot;&quot; fertilization, capacitation occurs by incubating spermatozoa that have either undergone ejaculation or have been extracted from the epididymis and incubated in a defined medium for several hours. There are different techniques to perform the capacitation step: simple washing, migration (swim-up), density gradients, and filter. The objective is to isolate as many motile spermatozoa as possible and to eliminate non-motile or dead spermatozoa. After either &quot;in vivo&quot; or &quot;in vitro&quot; capacitation the sperm must undergo the final maturation step, activation, involving the acrosome reaction.

Non-mammalian spermatozoa do not require this capacitation step and are ready to fertilize an oocyte immediately after release from the male.

== Function and mechanism ==
Capacitation has two effects: destabilisation of the acrosomal sperm head membrane which allows it to penetrate the outer layer of the egg, and chemical changes in the tail that allow a greater mobility in the sperm. The changes are facilitated by the removal of sterols (e.g. cholesterol) and non-covalently bound epididymal/seminal glycoproteins. The result is a more fluid membrane with an increased permeability to Ca2+ ion.

An influx of Ca2+ produces increased intracellular cAMP levels and thus, an increase in motility. Hyperactivation coincides with the onset of capacitation and is the result of the increased Ca2+ levels. It has a synergistic stimulatory effect with adenosine that increases adenylyl cyclase activity in the sperm.

The tripeptide fertilization promoting peptide (FPP) is essential for controlling capacitation. FPP is produced in the prostate gland as a component of the seminal fluid. FPP comes into contact with the spermatozoa during ejaculation, as the sperm and seminal fluid mix. High levels of active FPP prevent capacitation. After ejaculation, the concentration of FPP drops in the female reproductive tract. 

== Induction ==
Because assisted reproductive technologies, or ARTs, such as &quot;in vitro&quot; fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI) require the induction of sperm cell capacitation outside of normal biological parameters, numerous methods have been developed to induce this process in mammalian sperm cells. Sperm cells are harvested through ejaculation or harvested from the caudal epididymis and allowed to liquefy at room temperature. Capacitation can then be induced by adding media designed to mimic the electrolytic composition of the fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs. These media vary between species, but are saline-based and contain energy substrates such as lactate, pyruvate, and possibly glucose. A cholesterol acceptor is required to facilitate the removal of cholesterol from the sperm cell membrane, which is always albumin. Bovine serum albumin is typically used for &quot;in vitro&quot; animal studies, and human serum albumin (HSA) is used in human sperm capacitation induction.

Bicarbonate is a vital component of capacitation-inducing media, as it is co-transported into the cytosol where it activates soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) as well as acts as a pH buffer necessary to prevent decreasing the pH in the culture, a necessary addition when incubating cells at 5% CO2 as is generally used although not required. Calcium chloride is added to facilitated the influx via of calcium cations. In animal models, Tyrode&#x27;s albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP) medium is typically used as a base, which contains each of these components. In humans, human tubal fluid (HTF) is used.

These media can be supplemented with other chemicals to induce hyperactivated sperm motility and/or the acrosome reaction. For animal in vitro fertilization, caffeine at 5 mM concentration is a strong inducer of sperm capacitation &quot;in vitro&quot;. Calcium ionophores are also ideal to induce capacitation. Adding heparin to capacitation inducing medium mimics the secretion of heparin-like gycosaminoglycans (GAGs) near the oocyte and initiates the acrosome reaction. This effect is magnified when adding lysophosphatidylcholine (LC) in conjunction with heparin. Catecholamines such as norepinephrine at low concentrations have been shown to assist in acrosome reaction induction.

==&quot;In vitro&quot; capacitation techniques==

The traditional methods to perform &quot;in vitro&quot; capacitation are:

*Simple wash: this method only eliminates seminal plasma, it does not select the best spermatozoa. The sample is centrifuged and then, the supernatant is eliminated. It is used in severe oligozoospermia, cryptozoospermia or testis biopsy samples. It is performed before other capacitation techniques too.

*Migration (swim-up). Firstly, centrifugation takes place and seminal plasma is eliminated. Then, 0.5 -1 ml of culture medium is added at the top and after the incubation period at 37°C, the best motile spermatozoa will have ascend from the bottom to the top of the tube (healthy spermatozoa go to the culture medium). In order to obtain the fraction rich in spermatozoa, the top layer is collected. It is still widely used and useful in normozoospermia. It allows to obtain fractions with more than 90% of PR spermatozoa. 

*Density gradients. In this technique, a tube is filled with layers of liquids of different densities and semen is placed on the top layer. Then, The tube goes through a centrifugation to filter cell debris and non motile cells. After the centrifugation, healthy sperm are on the very bottom layer of the liquid in the tube, while debris and non-motile spermatozoa are in upper layers. This procedure takes approximately 60 minutes and it is specially indicated in oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia and abundant debris samples. At the end, all the cells will arrive to the bottom, but those with more motility will arrive sooner. This procedure is often called just the &quot;Percoll method&quot;, since Percoll was frequently used as the density medium, but other density mediums are now used.

*Filtration. It consist in a filter that does not allow every sperm to pass. It is less used nowadays and only spermatozoa with better motility will pass through the filter. 
However, nowadays there are new techniques which surpass these ones. For instance, we have PICSI, MACS or microfluidic chips.

== Measurement ==
Numerous methods have been developed to assess the degree to which sperm cells are undergoing capacitation in vitro. Computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) was developed in the 1980s for measuring sperm kinematics. CASA uses phase-contrast microscopy combined with sperm tracking software to analyze sperm motility parameters. Certain parameters such as curvilinear velocity (VCL), straightline velocity (VSL), average path velocity (VAP), and the amplitude of lateral head displacement (ALH) have been shown to be positively correlated with the acquisition of fertilization competency and are thus used to identify hyperactive sperm cell motility.

While motility measurements are critical for identifying the presence of hyperactive motility, additional methods have been developed to identify the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. A simple method uses Coomassie brilliant blue G250 to stain cells, providing visual evidence of intact or reacted acrosomes. More advanced techniques employ fluorescent or electron microscopy methods. Fluorescein-conjugated Peanut agglutinin (FITC-PNA) or &quot;Pisum sativum&quot; agglutinin (FITC-PSA) can be used to fluorescently tag the acrosome of sperm cells, which can be then used to assess the status of the acrosome using a fluorescent microscope.

==Discovery==
The discovery of this process was independently reported in 1951 by both Min Chueh Chang and Colin Russell Austin.

<doc id="1093860" wikidata="Q6928931" url="?curid=1093860" title="Mr. Mike's Mondo Video">
<text>Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video is a 1979 American Mondo-Mockumentary film conceived and directed by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; writer/featured player Michael O&#x27;Donoghue. It is a spoof of the controversial 1962 documentary &quot;Mondo Cane&quot;, showing people doing weird stunts (the logo for &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot; copies the original &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; logo).

Many cast members of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, including Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Laraine Newman, Bill Murray, Don Novello and Gilda Radner, appear in &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot;. People who had previously hosted &quot;SNL&quot;, or would go on to host (such as Carrie Fisher, Margot Kidder and Teri Garr) make cameo appearances in the film.

Others who appear in the film include musicians Sid Vicious, Paul Shaffer, Debbie Harry, Root Boy Slim, and Klaus Nomi; artist Robert Delford Brown; and model Patty Oja.

==History==
&quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot; was originally produced on videotape as an NBC television special that would have aired in place of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; during one of its live breaks. Because of the special&#x27;s vulgar and tasteless content, NBC declared that it did not meet the network&#x27;s programming standards and shelved it. Shortly thereafter, O&#x27;Donoghue met former NBC programming head Paul Klein at a party where the project was discussed; Klein was inspired to make a deal with NBC to pay the network the $300,000 it cost to produce the show in exchange for the rights to release it to movie theaters. The show was transferred from videotape to 35mm film for the release.

To pad the program to feature length, filmmaker Walter Williams created a special &quot;Mr. Bill Show&quot; episode, combining footage from his past Mr. Bill shorts from &quot;SNL&quot; with new wraparound scenes, to present at the head of the film as a short subject. Co-writer Mitchell Glazer states in the DVD&#x27;s audio commentary that many other scenes were added to pad the film&#x27;s runtime to the required 90 minutes for theatrical releases. However, some theaters showed a straight transfer of the master tape of the special, which included slots calling for the insertion of commercials.

The film would eventually be seen on television, albeit on pay cable and syndication, with several cuts, such as the non–sequitur &quot;Dream Sequences&quot;.

&quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video&quot; was released on home video in the early 1980s through Mike Nesmith&#x27;s Pacific Arts label. In January 2009, The film was released on DVD by Shout! Factory. The DVD and video tape releases mute the infamous &quot;My Way&quot; segment (see below), and removes Mr. Mike&#x27;s lead-in to the &quot;Church of the Jack Lord&quot; segment due to the inability of Shout! Factory to get the rights to use the &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; theme song.

==Plot==
The film is largely plotless; a series of vignettes linked together by interstitial pieces featuring Mr. Mike discussing how upsetting and odd the sequences are. He introduces some of the pieces via voiceover, and some open with no introduction.

Sequences include:
* Aykroyd displaying his webbed toes which he prodded with a screwdriver to prove they were not make-up.
* A church that worships Jack Lord as the one true god (also featuring Dan Aykroyd).
* A French restaurant that prides itself on how poorly it treats American patrons.
* A sequence where the movie&#x27;s &quot;guide&quot; takes viewers on a tour of an Amsterdam-based school that teaches cats how to swim, so they won&#x27;t drown in the city&#x27;s many canals.
* Several of the regular SNL female cast members at the time, including Jane Curtin and Gilda Radner, listing a wide variety of disgusting things men can do that would turn them on, including having &quot;a full, firm colostomy bag&quot;.
* &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; — a series of surreal film pieces bracketed by large light-up signs reading &quot;Dream Sequence&quot; and &quot;End Dream Sequence&quot; that track towards and away from the camera. One of these is merely performance footage of Klaus Nomi, while another features home movie footage shot by Emily Prager intercut with stop-motion animation.
* Jo Jo, The Human Hot Plate — a quick cutaway to performance artist Robert Delford Brown, smiling, undulating and dressed only in a pair of briefs while holding canned spaghetti in his cupped hands.
* The presentation of a classified government weapons project, &quot;Laserbra 2000&quot;. This piece is the last of a triptych of sequences that chronicle attempts to obtain the classified footage. In the first, the film (secreted in a violin case) is in fact someone&#x27;s home movies; in the second, the violin case contains a violin. &quot;National Lampoon&quot; writer Brian McConnachie appears in the footage as a scientist.
*Short films made by other directors:
** &quot;Cleavage&quot; by Mitchell Kriegman — closeup of a hand working its way out from (what is implied to be) between a large pair of breasts, feeling around gently, realizing where it was, and working its way back in.
** &quot;Crowd Scene Take One&quot;, by Andy Aaron and Ernie Fosselius — purports to be a director guiding background actors for a disaster movie scene.
** &quot;Uncle Si and the Sirens&quot; — anonymously-directed silent-era &quot;nudie-cutie&quot; short found by &quot;SNL&quot; alumnus Tom Schiller.

== Music ==
&quot;Mondo Cane&quot; features the hit song &quot;More&quot; (which was initially an instrumental song with words added later), sung by crooner Julius La Rosa. In &quot;Mr. Mike&#x27;s Mondo Video,&quot; O&#x27;Donoghue and writer Emily Prager (who also act in the film) take the instrumental song &quot;Telstar&quot; by Joe Meek and add lyrics to it, creating &quot;The Haunting Theme Song&quot;, also sung by La Rosa. The song is sung in English during the opening credits, and in nonsense Italian over the closing credits.

===Sid Vicious appearance===
&quot;Mondo Video&quot; features Sid Vicious performing the classic song &quot;My Way&quot; from &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot;, which had not yet been released in America at the time. On the initial Pacific Arts home video release, the audio is muted before Vicious begins singing. A crawl appears onscreen explaining that the owners of the song&#x27;s copyright would not permit audio of the performance to be included on the tape: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t a case of money&quot;, the crawl explains, &quot;they wouldn&#x27;t even discuss it.&quot; The sound returns when the performance switches to a heavy punk rock guitar riff, and Sid pulling out a gun, firing (presumably blanks) into the audience, flipping them the bird, and walking off.

The muted audio and explanatory crawl are carried over on the 2009 Shout! Factory release, despite the fact that the Sid Vicious version of the song can be seen and heard, in its entirety, in the DVD release of &quot;The Great Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Swindle&quot;, also released by Shout! Factory.

==Reception==
The film received reviews ranging from nearly-mixed to scathing.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the &quot;most depressing thing&quot; about the film &quot;is that there are beginnings of funny sketches all over the place but they&#x27;ve been abandoned before anything was done with them.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;pretty much confines itself to the sicker, more offensive end of the &#x27;Saturday Night Live&#x27; spectrum, though with far less humorous payoff than the latter regularly delivers.&quot; Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film one star out of four and called the humor &quot;sick and stupid,&quot; declaring that it was &quot;one case in which the television network is right, and the embattled performer is wrong. Truly wrong.&quot; Linda Gross wrote that the film &quot;feeds off television and mocks all that is middle-aged and middle-American. Its own methods are sophomoric and tacky. Rated R, it&#x27;s full of bad taste, but it doesn&#x27;t deliver its promised raunchiness.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;If you think that censors are always wrong, this show could change your mind. O&#x27;Donoghue doesn&#x27;t give offense by being obscenely funny. He gives offense by being obscenely pointless, tasteless and mean.&quot;

Bruce Blackadar of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; said that &quot;the truth is that not only is &quot;Mondo Video&quot; a prime candidate for worst movie of the year, it’s also bad television and it deserved to be censored because it’s stupid beyond redemption, joylessly repugnant, a rip-off of the first magnitude. It’s also the most boring unstructured and unintelligently produced effort ever by the Saturday Night group. But the worst crime of all is that &quot;Mondo Video&quot; has only enough truly funny moments to fill up the time it takes to sell a second-rate detergent in a television commercial.&quot; Michael Clark of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; wrote that the film &quot;hit town just one day after the merciful departure of &quot;Sammy Stops the World&quot;, another theatrically exhibited non-movie whose box-office performance will no doubt have theater owners all over the country pillaging their children&#x27;s college funds to come up with this month&#x27;s mortgage payment. &quot;Mike&quot; may do marginally better than &quot;Sammy&quot;, but most viewers will probably agree with the NBC censors who took one look at this slapdash collection of jokes about Gig Young&#x27;s groceries, Cheryl Tiegs&#x27; crotch, and a Cedar Rapids religious cult that worships Jack Lord as a living god and said, &#x27;NO.&#x27;&quot; Mitch Darden of &quot;The Indianapolis News&quot; said &quot;it&#x27;s billed as disgusting, disturbing, horrible, raunchy, gross, tasteless and if your children are falling asleep, wake them up to catch this show. That&#x27;s how the movie is billed, but don&#x27;t wake up the children to see this movie, it&#x27;s rated &#x27;R&#x27; for restricted—restricted to the few adults who like absurd comedy in its strangest form.&quot;

Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; wrote that &quot;yes, it’s good stuff, this Mondo. And it’s sick. And it’s a good thing it isn’t on TV, where some unwary soul could stumble on it in the wee hours only to be traumatized. At least moviegoers will know what to expect when they walk in. You are warned.&quot; Robert Alan Rose of the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; wrote that &quot;two disappointments quickly emerge in Mr. Mike&#x27;i Mondo Video, now in local theaters: Mr. Mike—alias Michael O&#x27;Donoghue—had nothing to do with writing or filming the animated antics of the clay sculpture, Mr. Bill. And—sadder to say—the rest of Mr. Mike&#x27;s 90-minute offering doesn&#x27;t come close to its opening segment.&quot; Greg Tozian of &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; said that &quot;in &quot;Mondo Video&quot;, a 90-minute grab bag of barf-styled humor that NBC first requested be filmed and finally refused to air (deciding it was &quot;offensive&quot;) O&#x27;Donohue seems to miss the mark much of the time.&quot; Bob Curtright of &quot;The Wichita Beacon&quot; said simply that &quot;the censor was right about this tasteless, offensive, sleazily-made hodge-podge.&quot; Walter V. Addiego of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; called it &quot;a collection of outrageous skits and jokes that are long on attempted offensiveness and sadly short on humor.&quot; Ernest Leogrande of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; said that the film &quot;evinces a kind of smugness, a suggestion that there are clods on the earth who need to have their conventional minds jolted by ideas that the &#x27;Mondo Video&#x27; crowd are able to take in stride.&quot;

Roger Catlin of the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; said it was &quot;not unlike a very good episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which may make you feel funny about dishing out money to see it. Without shampoo commercials and other interruptions, it’s almost worth it.&quot; Robert C. Trussell of &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; wrote that it &quot;gets two stars, not for its humor—of which there is little—but because its bizarre quality makes it an Interesting novelty piece.&quot; Jacqi Tully of &quot;The Arizona Daily Star&quot; wrote:

<text>Orlen S.A. (formerly ), commonly known as Orlen, is a Polish multinational oil refiner, petrol retailer and natural gas trader headquartered in Płock, Poland. The company&#x27;s subsidiaries include the main oil and gas companies of the Czech Republic and Lithuania, Unipetrol and Orlen Lietuva, respectively.

The corporation is a significant European publicly traded firm with operations in Poland as well as Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Pakistan, and Slovakia. As of 2025, the largest shareholder of the company is the Polish state (via the State Treasury) with 49.9% of the shares, ahead of Nationale-Nederlanden OFE with 5.2% of the shares.

The company is listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and, as of 2023, its reported revenue constituted over PLN 373 billion (ca. US$90 billion). It employs over 64,000 people, owns more than 3,400 service stations in seven countries and markets its products to over 100 countries worldwide.

Orlen is the largest company in Central and Eastern Europe and is listed in global rankings such as &quot;Fortune&quot; Global 500, Platts TOP250 and Thomson Reuters TOP100.

==History==
=== Foundation (1999–2002) ===
PKN Orlen was created in 1999 after the Council of Ministers of Poland in the previous year decided to partially privatise and merge two state-run petrochemical firms: Centrala Produktów Naftowych, Communist Poland&#x27;s petroleum retail monopoly, and Petrochemia Płock, the state firm in charge of the oil refineries in Płock, the largest complex of its kind in Poland. After said merger, the company was renamed Polski Koncern Naftowy (PKN), with Orlen added several months later as the consortium&#x27;s brand name. The new name is derived from Orl- for &quot;orzeł&quot; (Polish: eagle) and its adjective &quot;orli&quot;, and -en for &quot;energia&quot; (Polish: energy).

====Orlengate====

Orlengate is the biggest corruption scandal in the modern political history of Poland. The scandal was unearthed with the arrest on 7 February 2002 by the UOP (Office for State Protection) of Andrzej Modrzejewski, then CEO of PKN Orlen. He was accused of insider trading and disclosure of confidential information. Zbigniew Wrobel directly succeeded as CEO and proposed in December 2002 $160 million for the purchase of 295 German gas stations from the British BP PLC. It was the first step in Wrobel&#x27;s strategy of expanding west. At this time PKN Orlen was Poland&#x27;s largest company, with sales of $7.2 billion.

===International expansions (2003–2014)===
After losses in 2000 and 2001 the fund returned 25% in 2002. Until July 2003, it grew by nearly one-third since March and in total the fund was up by about 60% since the start of 1994.

In 2003, PKN Orlen acquired 500 filling stations in Northern Germany from BP under premise of a competition law when BP took over Aral AG. As of 2007 Orlen has 581 filling stations in Germany (484 under the Star brand, 58 under the Orlen brand and 29 under a supermarket brand).

In January 2003, PKN Orlen and MOL signed a Memorandum of Understanding whereby they agreed intention to initiate co-operation in the Central and Eastern European oil sector. They hoped that the collaboration would allow them both to benefit from the synergies and to compete more effectively in the global competition. In July 2003, the Croatian INA refinery was sold for $505 million to PKN Orlen&#x27;s competitor, the Hungarian oil company MOL. This strengthen MOL&#x27;s position in the battle for control of Central Europeans and Balkan fuel markets.

Furthermore, PKN Orlen was involved in merger talks with the MOL Group in 2005. If merged, the two firms would have created a regional giant, and controlled much of Central Europe&#x27;s oil industry. However, the planned merger failed due to high politicization. Following the dropped merger plans, PKN Orlen bought a majority stake in Czech Unipetrol. During May 2006, the company announced its largest investment ever when it took over a majority share of 84.3% of the largest company of Lithuania, Mažeikių Nafta. It was partly bought from Yukos (53.7%) and partly from the Lithuanian government (30.6%) in December. Earlier on 12 October a fire damaged the Mažeikių refinery, which caused a loss about $75 million. With the completion of the takeover, PKN Orlen became Central Europe&#x27;s largest company.

In May 2007, after Lithuania sold its refinery to PKN Orlen, the Russian government approved the construction of a new $2 billion pipeline, that passes Belarus and Lithuania.

In 2007, the unit of Polish oil group PKN Orlen PKNA.WA and Dwory Chemicals bought a synthetic rubber company Kaucuk from Czech oil group Unipetrol UNPEsp.PR. The sale was part of a drive by Unipetrol to divest non-core assets and to focus on petrochemical, oil refinery and fuel retailing business.

In 2010, PKN Orlen had a reported revenue of $28.8 billion. Next year it was the largest fuel retailer in Poland with over 2000 locations. The company ran the most advanced and the second largest complex for terephthalic acid production in Europe. PKN Orlen also sponsors the Orlen Arena in Płock since its opening in 2010.

In 2013, PKN Orlen and Klaipedos Nafta oil terminal negotiated the co-operation on a new pipeline supported by the Lithuanian government. In order to establish the company in Canada and to become an oil producer Orlen bought the oil and gas company TriOil Resources Ltd for $169 million in September 2013. After its first foreign expansion the company acquired Birchill Exploration Ltd due to double its production in May 2014.

PKN Orlen, under a joint venture with the Dutch-American firm LyondellBasell, also owns Poland&#x27;s largest plastics company called Basell Orlen Polyolefins Sp. z o.o.

===Diversification (2015–present)===

In 2019, PKN Orlen opened its first petrol station in Slovakia through its Czech subsidiary Unipetrol under the Benzina brand. At the end of 2020, 20 Orlen stations were operating in Slovakia.

At the end of 2019, PKN Orlen and PZU established the &quot;Sigma Bis&quot; media agency.

PKN Orlen has been implementing a development strategy since 2018, which involves transforming the company into a multi-energy and commercial group. In April 2020, Orlen acquired 80% of Energa shares, and on 14 July 2020 announced that it obtained permission the European Commission&#x27;s for the takeover of Grupa Lotos, first announced in 2018. On 1 August 2022, Orlen finalised the merger with Lotos.

In November 2020, PKN Orlen purchased 65% of the shares of the financially troubled newsagents chain Ruch SA. On 7 December 2020 Orlen signed an agreement to acquire 100% of shares in the media and press company &quot;Polska Press sp. z o.o.&quot; and the transaction was carried out on 1 March 2021. This decision was met with criticism from Polish Ombudsman, Adam Bodnar, who expressed his concern about the risk to freedom of speech that this takeover poses as PKN Orlen is a state-owned company and the constitutional right to press freedom excludes the possibility of political influence on the press, even an indirect one.

In December 2020, PKN Orlen bought an agricultural biogas plant Bioenergy Project, which it will transform into a biomethane plant. To secure supplies, the company Biozec, responsible for the sale and distribution of thermal energy supplied by the biogas plant, was also acquired. In 2021, Orlen bought 4 wind farms: in February, the Kanin farm with a capacity of 20 MW, and in March, another three with a total capacity of 89.4 MW.

On 14 July 2020, PKN Orlen announced its intention to take over PGNiG, and on 10 May 2021, it submitted a takeover application to the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection. In October 2022, shareholders of PGNiG approved the company&#x27;s takeover by PKN Orlen, this came after PKN Orlen Shareholders had done the same.

In 2020, the company announced its plans to become emission-neutral by 2050 becoming the first oil company from Central Europe to do so. In order to achieve this goal, by 2030, Orlen aims to reduce emissions from its current refining and petrochemical assets by 20% and emissions from power generation by 33% /MWh.

In June 2021, PKN Orlen opened its first &quot;Orlen w ruchu&quot; standalone convenience store in Warsaw, competing in this segment with Carrefour Express, Circle K and Żabka. In September 2021, the company entered the parcel locker sector with the launch of &quot;Orlen Paczka&quot; in co-operation with Poczta Polska.

In December 2022, PKN Orlen entered the Hungarian market with the takeover of 143 petrol stations from Hungary&#x27;s MOL in a deal related to the acquisition of 410 petrol stations in Poland by MOL under an agreement between Orlen and Grupa Lotos. The sale was the result of the European Commission requiring PKN Orlen to divest its assets in order to approve the company&#x27;s acquisition of Grupa Lotos in accordance with EU competition law.

In March 2023, PKN Orlen began to sponsor the Stadion im. Kazimierza Górskiego, located opposite the Orlen Arena in Płock. In the same month, Ukrainian oil company Ukrnafta signed a contract with PKN Orlen to allow the latter to export petrochemical products to Ukraine.

On 3 July 2023, the company changed its name from PKN Orlen to Orlen S.A., to reflect its diversification from fossil fuels. In September 2023, the European Commission approved the takeover by Orlen Group of the consumer retail division of the Austrian oil trading company , which operates 266 filling stations in Austria under the discount brand.

In August 2023, the company&#x27;s supervisory board conditionally approved an investment in an off-shore wind farm located on the Baltic Sea. The joint project between Orlen and Northland Power is aimed at achieving the company&#x27;s goal of generating 9 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030. The Baltic Power farm, located about 23 km off the coast, will consist of 76 wind turbines with a capacity of 15 MW each, providing energy to over 1.5 million households upon completion in 2026.

In December 2023, the Polish government approved the construction of 24 new small modular reactor (SMR) units in six sites across the country. Orlen Synthos Green Energy (OSGE), a joint venture between Orlen and chemicals company Synthos, plans to deploy Poland&#x27;s first small reactors by 2030.

Orlen will pay a dividend for 2023 in the amount of PLN 4.15 per share. The total value of the dividend is PLN 4,817,909.5 thousand. The dividend yield is 6.82%. The last listing with dividend rights took place on September 18, 2024, and the dividend payment date was set for December 20, 2024

== Sponsorship ==
PKN Orlen has sponsored the Polish Athletic Association, the Polish Volleyball Association, the Polish Olympic and Paralympic Committees, and various Polish motorsport competitors such as Bartosz Zmarzlik, Jakub Przygoński, Bartek Marszałek, Grupa Żelazny and Wojtek Bógdał.

In 2019, PKN Orlen sponsored Williams Racing and driver Robert Kubica in Formula One with €10 million. After Kubica&#x27;s move to Alfa Romeo Racing in a reserve driver role in 2020, the Polish petrol retailer became the co-title sponsor of the team as Alfa Romeo Racing Orlen in 2020 and 2021 and as Alfa Romeo F1 Team Orlen in 2022. In January 2023, PKN Orlen signed a multi-year agreement with Scuderia AlphaTauri as a principal partner. Orlen&#x27;s logo would continue to appear on the team&#x27;s cars as they were renamed to RB in . In November 2023, the company became an official sponsor of the ski jumping hill in Oberstdorf, Germany, presently known as ORLEN Arena Oberstdorf.

== Orlen loss ==

In early 2025, PKN Orlen announced a loss of approximately $378 million due to prepayments for Venezuelan oil that was never delivered. 

The deal was reportedly facilitated by Venezuelan oil trader Antonio Luis González Morales through his Dubai-based company, Hannon International Middle East DMCC. In December 2023, Orlen’s Swiss subsidiary transferred significant sums to Hannon and another intermediary, Horizon Global, with payments totaling $230 million and $100 million, respectively. However, Venezuela’s state oil company, PDVSA, never received the funds, and the oil was not delivered, resulting in substantial financial losses for Orlen. 

The former CEO of OTS, identified as Samer A., is suspected of authorizing the fraudulent transaction without proper oversight. He was arrested in the United Arab Emirates in early 2025 and may be extradited to Poland to face charges related to corruption and mismanagement. 

Orlen has so far managed to recover $100 million through a settlement, but investigations are ongoing to trace the remaining funds and determine the full extent of involvement of all parties.

<text>Alfred Ernest Jean III (born January 9, 1961) is an American screenwriter and producer. Jean is well known for his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. He was raised near Detroit, Michigan, and graduated from Harvard University in 1981. Jean began his writing career in the 1980s with fellow Harvard alum Mike Reiss. Together, they worked as writers and producers on television shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;.

Jean was offered a job as a writer on the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in 1989, alongside Reiss, and together they became the first members of the show&#x27;s original writing staff. They served as showrunners during the show&#x27;s third (1991–92) and fourth (1992–93) seasons, though they left &quot;The Simpsons&quot; after season four to create &quot;The Critic&quot;, an animated show about film critic Jay Sherman. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 (then aired its second season on Fox in March 1995) and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and only lasted for two seasons.

In 1994, Jean and Reiss signed a three-year development deal with The Walt Disney Company to produce other television shows for ABC. Among multiple pitches made by the duo, their sole project with ABC to come to fruition was the live-action sitcom &quot;Teen Angel&quot;, which was cancelled in its first season. Jean returned full-time to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; during the tenth season (1998–99). He became showrunner again with the start of the thirteenth season in 2001, without Reiss, and he stayed in that position until thirty-three. Jean was also one of the writers and producers who worked on &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, a feature-length film based on the series, released in 2007.

==Early life==

Alfred Ernest Jean III was born in Detroit, Michigan on January 9, 1961. He was raised in Farmington Hills, Michigan, graduated from Harrison High School, and is of Irish ancestry. After working at his father&#x27;s hardware store, Jean arrived at Harvard University when he was sixteen years old and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics. Daryl Libow, one of Jean&#x27;s freshman roommates, said he was a &quot;math whiz&quot; when he arrived at Harvard but &quot;soon blossomed and found his comedic feet.&quot; In Holworthy Hall at Harvard, Jean met fellow freshman Mike Reiss; they befriended one another and collaborated in their writing efforts for the humor publication &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot;. Jeff Martin, another writer for the &quot;Lampoon&quot;, said &quot;they definitely loomed large around the magazine. They were very funny guys and unusually polished comedy writers for that age. We were never surprised that they went on to success.&quot; Jean has also stated that the duo spent most of their time at the &quot;Lampoon&quot;, adding that &quot;it was practically my second dorm room.&quot; He eventually became vice-president of the publication.

==Career==
===Early career and &quot;The Simpsons&quot;===
The humor magazine &quot;National Lampoon&quot; hired Jean and Reiss after they graduated in 1981. During the 1980s, the duo began collaborating on various television material. During this period, they worked as writers and producers on television shows such as &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;. In 1989, Jean was offered a job as a writer on the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, a show created by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Sam Simon that continues to air today. Many of Jean&#x27;s friends were not interested in working on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; because it was a cartoon and they did not think it would last long. Jean, however, was a fan of the work of Groening, Brooks and Simon, and therefore took the job together with Reiss.

The duo became the first members of the original &quot;Simpsons&quot; writing staff and worked on the thirteen episodes of the series&#x27; first season (1989–90). While watching the first episode of the show, &quot;Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire&quot;, premiering on television in December 1989, Jean opined to himself that the series was the greatest project he had been involved with and desired to continue working on it for the rest of his professional career. What he enjoyed most about &quot;The Simpsons&quot; at the time was something he recognized from Brooks&#x27; previous work: although the show was largely based on humor, it had depth and warmth.
Although Jean has been credited as the sole writer of several episodes, he considers the process to be mainly collaborative: &quot;the principal writer [of an episode] has, at most, written 40% of the script. It&#x27;s a real team effort.&quot; The writer credited in the episode&#x27;s opening credits is the person that came up with the idea for the episode and wrote the first draft, even if he or she only contributed to a small part of the final script. Jean has stated that Lisa Simpson is one of his favorite characters to write for. She is the character he relates to the most because of their similar childhoods and the fact that he has a daughter.

Jean became showrunner of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; at the start of the third season (1991–92) together with Reiss. A showrunner has the ultimate responsibility of all the processes that an episode goes through before completion, including the writing, the animation, the voice acting and the music. According to Jean, when he began his tenure as showrunner, the only thing he thought to himself every day was &quot;Don&#x27;t blow it and screw up this thing everyone loves.&quot; The first episode Jean and Reiss ran was &quot;Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington&quot; (aired September 26, 1991), and they felt pressured to make it good, so much so that they did six to seven rewrites of the script in order to improve its humor. Jean said he &quot;kept thinking &#x27;It&#x27;s not good enough. It&#x27;s not good enough.&#x27;&quot; Reiss added that &quot;we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this.&quot;

Jean and Reiss served as showrunners until the end of the fourth season in 1993. Since the show had already established itself in the first two seasons, they were able to give it more depth during their tenure. Jean believes this is one of the reasons that many fans and critics regard season three and four as the best seasons of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Bill Oakley, another &quot;Simpsons&quot; writer, has commented that &quot;Mike and Al are responsible for the best thing that ever appeared on television, which was the third season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.&quot; Comedy writer Jay Kogen has said that &quot;those years with Al Jean and Mike Reiss running it were pretty darn good. And then the ones after that maybe not so much. Some people ran it better than others.&quot;

===&quot;The Critic&quot; and Disney===

Jean and Reiss left &quot;The Simpsons&quot; after its fourth season in order to create &quot;The Critic&quot;, an animated show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. &quot;The Critic&quot; was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since &quot;The Simpsons&quot; also aired on that network, Brooks was able to create a crossover between it and &quot;The Critic.&quot;

Said crossover occurred through the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;A Star Is Burns&quot; (1995). Groening was not fond of the crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for &quot;The Critic&quot;. Brooks said, &quot;for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right. The point is, Matt&#x27;s name has been on Mike&#x27;s and Al&#x27;s scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. &quot;The Critic&quot; is their shot and he should be giving them his support.&quot; Reiss stated that he was a &quot;little upset&quot; by Groening&#x27;s actions and that &quot;this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn&#x27;t say &#x27;Watch &quot;The Critic&quot;″ all over it.&quot; Jean added &quot;What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if &quot;The Critic&quot; never existed.&quot; On Fox, &quot;The Critic&quot; was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.

In 1994, Jean and Reiss signed a three-year deal with The Walt Disney Company to produce other television shows for ABC. The duo created and executive produced &quot;Teen Angel&quot;, which was canceled in its first season. Reiss said &quot;It was so compromised and overworked. I had 11 executives full-time telling me how to do my job.&quot; The pair periodically returned to work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;— for example, while under contract at Disney they were allowed to write and produce four episodes of the show, including season eight&#x27;s &quot;Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(Annoyed Grunt)cious&quot; (1997).

===Further work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;===

Following &quot;Teen Angel&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Jean and Reiss ceased their writing partnership. Subsequently, Jean alone returned full-time to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; during the tenth season (1998–99) and became a prominent writer and executive producer during the ensuing three seasons, all produced under Mike Scully&#x27;s supervision. Following Scully&#x27;s departure in 2001, Jean returned to the showrunner position with the start of the thirteenth season (2001–2002), likewise without Reiss. Jean called it &quot;a great job with a lot of responsibility,&quot; and cited &quot;the fact that people love it so much&quot; as &quot;great.&quot; He adds, however, that &quot;the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we&#x27;ve done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that&#x27;s good, but hasn&#x27;t been seen.&quot; Jean&#x27;s return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC&#x27;s Jon Bonné stating: &quot;Jean, who took the show&#x27;s helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show&#x27;s long-time fans.&quot; However, some critics have argued that the show&#x27;s quality has continued to decline in recent years during Jean&#x27;s tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s possible that we&#x27;ve declined. But honestly, I&#x27;ve been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, &#x27;It&#x27;s gone downhill.&#x27; If we&#x27;d listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I&#x27;m glad we didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Jean was one of the writers and producers who worked on &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, a feature-length film released in 2007. The show&#x27;s voice cast was signed on to do the film in 2001, and work then began on the script. The &quot;Simpsons&quot; producers were initially worried that creating a film would have a negative effect on the show, as they did not have enough crew to focus their attention on both projects. As the show progressed, additional writers and animators were hired so that both the show and the film could be produced at the same time. Groening and Brooks were therefore able to invite Jean (who continued to work as show runner on the television show) to produce the film with them.

Jean frequently appears on the &quot;Simpsons&quot; DVD audio commentaries for episodes which he has collaborated on. He told IGN that he enjoys doing them because he has not seen some of the episodes in ten to fifteen years, and &quot;it&#x27;s kind of like a reunion to see some of the people that I worked with before, so it&#x27;s a really pleasant experience.&quot;

As of 2020 he is joint showrunner with Matt Selman, showrunning four to six episodes per season himself beginning with the thirty-third. Jean has also co-written/produced a number of Simpsons shorts including “Maggie Simpson in ‘The Longest Daycare’” (Oscar nominated) “The Force Awakens From its Nap” (emmy nominated), “When Billie Met Lisa” (emmy nominated) and “Simpsons : Balenciega” (won Clio).

==Awards==
Jean has received ten Emmy Awards and two Peabody Awards for his work on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. In 1997, he and Reiss won an Annie Award in the &quot;Best Producing in a TV Production&quot; category for the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Springfield Files&quot;. In 1991 they shared the Writing A Comedy Series CableAce Award for the It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show Episode &quot;My Mother The Wife&quot;. In 2006, the duo was given the Animation Writers Caucus Animation Award which is given by the Writers Guild of America to writers that &quot;advanced the literature of animation in film and/or television through the years and who has made outstanding contributions to the profession of the animation writer.&quot;

==Personal life==
As of 2005, Jean lives in Los Angeles, California, with his wife, television writer Stephanie Gillis. Jean also has two daughters.

<text>Fritz Fischer (5 March 1908 – 1 December 1999) was a German historian best known for his analysis of the causes of World War I. In the early 1960s Fischer advanced the controversial thesis at the time that responsibility for the outbreak of the war rested solely on Imperial Germany. Fischer&#x27;s anti-revisionist claims shocked the West German government and historical establishment, as it made Germany guilty for both world wars, challenging the national belief in Germany&#x27;s innocence and converting its recent history into one of conquest and aggression. 
Fischer was named in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing&quot; as the most important German historian of the 20th century. In 1984, he was elected an honorary member of the American Historical Association.

== Biography ==
Fischer was born in Ludwigsstadt in Bavaria. His father was a railway inspector. Educated at grammar schools in Ansbach and Eichstätt, Fischer attended the University of Berlin and the University of Erlangen, where he studied history, pedagogy, philosophy and theology. Fischer joined the Nazi Party in 1939, and left the Party in 1942. Fischer&#x27;s major early influences were the standard Hegelian-Rankean opposition typical of the pre-1945 German historical profession, and as such, Fischer&#x27;s early writings bore a strong bent towards the right. This influence was reflected in Fischer&#x27;s first books, biographies of Ludwig Nicolovius, a leading 19th-century Prussian educational reformer and of Moritz August von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Prussian Minister of Education between 1858 and 1862.

In 1942, Fischer was given a professorship at the University of Hamburg and he married Margarete Lauth-Volkmann, with whom he fathered two children. He served in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; in World War II. After his release from a POW camp in 1947, he went on as a professor at the University of Hamburg, where he stayed until his retirement in 1978. He was made an honorary member of the American Historical Association in 1984.

== Theorist and author ==

=== National Socialism ===

After World War II, Fischer re-evaluated his previous beliefs, and decided that the popular explanations of National Socialism offered by such historians as Friedrich Meinecke in which Adolf Hitler was just a (an &#x27;occupational accident&#x27;, meaning &#x27;a spanner in the works&#x27;) of history were unacceptable. In 1949, at the first post-war German Historians&#x27; Congress in Munich, Fischer strongly criticized the Lutheran tradition in German life, accusing the Lutheran church of glorifying the state at the expense of individual liberties and thus helping to bring about Nazi Germany. Fischer complained that the Lutheran church had for too long glorified the state as a divinely sanctioned institution that could do no wrong, and thus paved the way for National Socialism. Fischer rejected the then popular argument in Germany that Nazi Germany had been the result of the Treaty of Versailles, and instead argued that the origins of Nazi Germany predated 1914, and were the result of long-standing ambitions of the German power elite.

=== Fischer thesis ===

In the 1950s, Fischer examined the Imperial German government archives – those that were extant and available at the time – relating to the First World War. (This had previously been done by Karl Kautsky, Professor Walther Schucking and Count Max Montgelas, whose findings were published at Charlottenburg in November 1919 in a collection known as the &quot;Kautsky documents&quot;. This large book was published in English in 1924 as &quot;Outbreak of the World War&quot;. A further book by Count Montgelas, &quot;The Case for the Central Powers&quot;, was published in London the following year.)

In 1961, Fischer, who by then had risen to the rank of full professor at the University of Hamburg, rocked the history profession with his first postwar book, &quot;Griff nach der Weltmacht: Die Kriegszielpolitik des kaiserlichen Deutschland 1914–1918&quot; (published in English as &quot;Germany&#x27;s Aims in the First World War&quot;), in which he argued that Germany had deliberately instigated World War I in an attempt to become a world power. In this book, which was primarily concerned with the role played in the formation of German foreign policy by domestic pressure groups, Fischer argued that various pressure groups in German society had ambitions for aggressive imperialist policy in Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East. In Fischer&#x27;s opinion, the &quot;September Program&quot; of September 1914 calling for the annexation of parts of Europe and Africa was an attempt at compromise between the demands of the lobbying groups in German society for wide-ranging territorial expansion. Fischer argued that the German government used the July Crisis caused by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the summer of 1914 to act on plans for a war against the Dual Entente to create , a German-dominated Europe, and , a German-dominated Africa. Though Fischer argued that the German government did not want a war with the British Empire, they were ready to run the risk in pursuit of annexation and hegemony.

The American historian Klaus Epstein opined, in his review of Fischer&#x27;s book published in October 1962, that Fischer instantly rendered obsolete every book previously published on the subject of responsibility for the First World War and German aims in that war. Fischer&#x27;s position on German responsibility for World War I has become known as the &quot;Fischer thesis&quot;.

The book was preceded by Fischer&#x27;s groundbreaking 1959 article in the &quot;Historische Zeitschrift&quot; in which he first published the arguments that he expanded upon in his 1961 book. In &quot;The Shield of Achilles: War, Peace, and the Course of History&quot;, Philip Bobbitt wrote that Fischer&#x27;s publication made it &quot;impossible to maintain&quot; that World War I had been a &quot;ghastly mistake&quot; rather than the consequence of German policy.

For most Germans, it was acceptable to believe that Germany had caused World War II, but not World War I, which was still widely regarded as a war forced upon Germany by its encircling enemies. Fischer was the first German historian to publish documents showing that the German chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg had made plans in September 1914 (after the war began) to annex all of Belgium, part of France and part of Russia. Fischer suggested that there was continuity in German foreign policy from 1900 to the Second World War, implying that Germany was responsible for both world wars. These ideas were expanded in his later books &quot;Krieg der Illusionen&quot; (&quot;War of Illusions&quot;), &quot;Bündnis der Eliten&quot; (&quot;From Kaiserreich to Third Reich&quot;) and &quot;Hitler war kein Betriebsunfall&quot; (&quot;Hitler Was No Accident&quot;). Though Fischer was an expert on the Imperial era, his work was important in the debate on the foreign policy of the Third Reich.

In his 1969 book &quot;War of Illusions&quot; (&quot;Krieg der Illusionen&quot;), Fischer offered a detailed study of German politics from 1911 to 1914 in which he offered an analysis of German foreign policy based on the &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; (primacy of domestic politics). In Fischer&#x27;s view, the Imperial German state saw itself besieged by rising demands for democracy at home and sought to weaken them through a policy of aggression abroad.

Fischer was the first German historian to support the negative version of the (&quot;special path&quot;) interpretation of German history, which holds that the way German society developed from the Reformation (or from a later time, such as the establishment of the German Reich in 1871) inexorably culminated in the Third Reich. In Fischer&#x27;s view, while 19th-century German society moved forwards economically and industrially, it did not do so politically. For Fischer, German foreign policy before 1914 was largely motivated by the efforts of the reactionary German elite to distract the public from casting their votes for the Social Democrats and to make Germany the world&#x27;s greatest power at the expense of France, Britain and Russia. The German elite that caused World War I was also responsible for the failure of the Weimar Republic, which opened the way for the Third Reich. This traditional German elite, in Fischer&#x27;s analysis, was dominated by a racist, imperialist and capitalist ideology that was little different from the beliefs of the Nazis. For this reason, Fischer called Bethmann Hollweg the &quot;Hitler of 1914&quot;. Fischer&#x27;s arguments set off what is called the &quot;Fischer Controversy&quot; of the early 1960s when German historians led by Gerhard Ritter attempted to rebut Fischer. The Australian historian John Moses noted in 1999 that the documentary evidence introduced by Fischer is extremely persuasive in arguing that Germany was responsible for World War I. In 1990, &quot;The Economist&quot; advised its readers to examine Fischer&#x27;s &quot;well documented&quot; book to examine why people in Eastern Europe feared the prospect of German reunification.

Fischer and his analytical model caused a revolution in German historiography. His &quot;Primat der Innenpolitik&quot; heuristic, with its examination of the &quot;inputs&quot; into German foreign policy by domestic pressure groups and their interaction with the imperialist ideas of the German elite, forced a re-evaluation of German foreign policy in the Imperial era. Fischer&#x27;s discovery of Imperial German government documents advocating as a war aim the ethnic cleansing of Russian Poland and subsequent German colonization to provide Germany with &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space) led many to argue that similar schemes pursued by the Nazis in World War II were not due solely to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ideas but rather reflected widely held German aspirations that long pre-dated Hitler. Many German historians in the 1960s such as Gerhard Ritter, who liked to argue that Hitler was just a of history with no real connection to German history, were outraged by Fischer&#x27;s publication of these documents and attacked his work as &quot;anti-German&quot;.

== Criticisms ==
Fischer&#x27;s allegations caused a deep controversy throughout the academic world, particularly in West Germany. His arguments caused so much anger that his publisher&#x27;s office in Hamburg was firebombed. His works inspired other historians, such as Gerhard Ritter, to write books and articles against his war-aims thesis.

Many critics claim that Fischer placed Germany outside the proper historical context. They argue that Germany was not uniquely aggressive amongst European nations of the early 20th century, a time when Social Darwinist views of struggle were popular in Europe&#x27;s ruling classes. Critics also contend that in the centuries following Columbus&#x27;s voyages to America, the Western European countries including Britain, France, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, etc. had already acquired vast overseas colonial possessions and spheres of influence long before German unification in 1871, so it is difficult to single out Germany alone as &quot;grasping for world power&quot; when this was a centuries-old Western European tradition. It was not until after World War II that many European colonial subjects finally won their independence. Even after the conclusion of the Second World War, France refused to relinquish control over Indochina.

Moreover, Fischer&#x27;s timetable has also been criticized as inaccurate. Bethmann Hollweg&#x27;s Septemberprogramm, outlining German war aims, was not produced until after the war had begun and was still going well for Germany. At the same time, other powers had been harboring similarly grandiose plans for post-war territorial gains. Since its defeat in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, France was committed to a path of revenge against Germany and the reacquisition of Alsace and Lorraine. Russia, too, had long-standing, explicit war aims.

<text>All You Need Is Cash (also known as The Rutles) is a 1978 television film that traces (in mockumentary style) the career of a fictitious English rock group called the Rutles. As &quot;TV Guide&quot; described it, the group&#x27;s resemblance to the Beatles is &quot;purely – and satirically – intentional&quot;.

The film was co-produced by the production companies of Eric Idle and Lorne Michaels, and it was directed by Idle and Gary Weis. It was first broadcast on 22 March 1978 on NBC, earning the lowest ratings of any show on American prime time network television that week, though those who did watch it gave almost unanimously good reviews. It did much better in the ratings when it premiered in the UK on BBC2 on 27 March 1978.

==Premise==
&quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; is a series of skits and gags that illustrate the fictional Rutles story, closely following the chronology of the Beatles&#x27; career.

==Production==
===Writing===
The film was co-written by Eric Idle and Neil Innes. The music and events of the Rutles paralleled that of the Beatles, parodying many of the latter&#x27;s career highlights. For example, the 1968 animated film &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; became the &quot;Yellow Submarine Sandwich&quot;, and the song &quot;Get Back&quot; became &quot;Get Up and Go&quot;.

===Casting===
The Rutles were played by Eric Idle, John Halsey, Ricky Fataar, and Neil Innes. The band originally appeared in a sketch on Idle&#x27;s programme &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot; in 1975.

The film has many cameo appearances by both English and American comedians, including alumni of &quot;Monty Python&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and &quot;Rutland Weekend Television&quot;. George Harrison has a cameo role as a television journalist conducting an interview outside the headquarters of Rutle Corps, oblivious to the stream of people coming out of the building carrying items stolen from the office; this is a reference to the Beatles&#x27; famously plundered Apple Boutique and Apple Headquarters, where even the ceiling lining was looted. The interview ends abruptly as the microphone is stolen out of his hand.

The film also features cameos from Idle&#x27;s fellow Python Michael Palin; several &quot;SNL&quot; cast members including Gilda Radner, John Belushi, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Al Franken, and Tom Davis; Bianca Jagger as Dirk McQuickly&#x27;s wife Martini; Ronnie Wood as a Hells Angel; and Mick Jagger, Paul Simon, and Roger McGough as themselves.

==Soundtrack==
Innes, a former member of the English musical comedy group Bonzo Dog Band and an associate of the Monty Python troupe, became acquainted with the Beatles when the Bonzo Dog Band had a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;, in which they performed &quot;Death Cab for Cutie&quot;. Paul McCartney had also produced the Bonzos&#x27; 1968 hit single, &quot;I&#x27;m the Urban Spaceman&quot;, composed and sung by Innes.

Fourteen of Innes&#x27;s songs were released on a soundtrack album (the CD version added six songs omitted from the original vinyl album) named &quot;The Rutles&quot;. The album was both critically and commercially successful and was nominated for a Grammy award for Best Comedy Recording of the year. The orchestrations and arrangements for the Rutles recordings were made by film composer John Altman. John Halsey, Ricky Fataar, and Neil Innes performed their own respective musical and vocal parts, but Eric Idle&#x27;s vocals were sung [slightly sped up] by Ollie Halsall, who also played the lead guitar parts.

==Home media==
The show has been released on DVD, originally in a 66-minute version incorporating cuts for syndication, later in a &quot;special edition&quot; restored to its full length of 76 minutes and with extras including a commentary by Idle. The full-length version replaces a spoof newsreel voiceover by Idle with an American-sounding announcer. In 2013, the show was given a Blu-ray release in the form of a double pack with &quot;The Rutles 2: Can&#x27;t Buy Me Lunch&quot;, once again in including &quot;All You Need Is Cash&quot; in its original 76-minute version.

The soundtrack was reissued on CD. It included additional tracks from the original television sessions remixed in stereo by Neil Innes. Innes, Fataar and Halsey returned in 1996 to record &quot;The Rutles Archaeology&quot;, but without the involvement of Eric Idle.

<doc id="1093889" wikidata="Q705443" url="?curid=1093889" title="Gando Convention">
<text>The 1909 Gando Convention () was a treaty signed between Imperial Japan and Qing China in which Japan recognized China&#x27;s claims to Jiandao, called Gando in Korean, and Mount Paektu, and in return Japan received railroad concessions in Northeast China (&quot;Manchuria&quot;). After the Surrender of Japan, Gando Convention was de jure nullified. While China (then still divided between the Nationalist and Communist factions) took control of Manchuria and the northwestern half of Mt. Paektu, the Korean government north of the 38th Parallel (the present-day government of the DPRK or North Korea) took control of the southeastern half of Mt. Paektu in addition to taking control of the Korean Peninsula north of the 38th Parallel.

Gando/Jiandao is a historical border region along the north bank of the Tumen River in Jilin Province, Northeast China that has a high population of ethnic Koreans.

Many Koreans maintain a claim on Gando for they regard the Gando Convention treaty null and void, and because the area is still largely inhabited by Koreans. 

== Background ==

Jiandao, or Gando in Korean, is today part of Northeastern China. Many different states and tribes succeeded one another in ruling the area during ancient times, including Korean states Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae, followed later by the Khitans and the Jurchen Jin Dynasty.

Traditionally, the area was inhabited by nomadic tribes from the north and west, as well as Koreans and Chinese fleeing unrest, famine, or other sociopolitical conditions in their home countries. Eventually, it and much of the rest of Manchuria came under the control of the Manchus and later the Qing Dynasty. Gando itself, as it shared a border with Korea, was a particularly high-frequency destination for Koreans fleeing worsening conditions in the late Joseon dynasty after the early 1800s.

By the middle and the end of the 19th century, Koreans formed a majority of the population living in Gando, and when the Qing opened up Manchuria to Han Chinese migration in the 1870s and Gando in 1881, the large number of Korean already living there raised a boundary dispute issue that had been negotiated in 1712. An ambiguity in the characters used, was subject to some speculation, which was used by the Koreans living in Gando to claim that they were still on Korean soil.

While punishments for cross-border movement into northeast China by Han Chinese and Koreans by their respective governments (the Qing and Joseon) were on the books and Koreans apprehended in Gando were repatriated to Korea by Qing authorities, it is evident that these regulations did not deter people fleeing poor conditions, and they were able to make the claim in an attempt to escape relocation and punishment. The ambiguity in the original 1712 treaty gradually became official Joseon policy, but the issue itself did not come to a head until this time, when the Joseon Dynasty itself was in much turmoil and in no position to re-negotiate the boundary.

By the early 20th century, with increasing Japanese intervention in Korea, more Koreans fled to Gando, where they were sometimes welcomed by local Qing authorities, as a source of labor and agricultural know-how. Additionally, as a result of this consolidation of Japanese control over Korea (which would culminate with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, with which Japan annexed Korea and began the Japanese occupation of Korea that ended in 1945), Korea was not able to renegotiate the renewed boundary issues with the Qing, which was having its own problems with Japanese and Western imperialism.

== Japanese interventions ==
By 1905, the Korean Empire was effectively a Japanese protectorate (see Eulsa Treaty). As a result of the Russo-Japanese War, which ended in the same year, Korea was fully surrounded and occupied by Japanese troops. The negotiations to end the war resulted in the Portsmouth Treaty, which stated, &quot;Japan possesses in Korea paramount political, military, and economical interests&quot; and with the Russian concessions to Japan effectively ensured a Japanese sphere of influence in northeast Asia.

In 1907, Japanese forces infiltrated the rather porous border between Korea and China. A few months later, the Japanese called the border issue &quot;unsettled&quot; because the majority of the population there was still ethnically Korean; as effective overlords of Korea, they claimed that Japan&#x27;s jurisdiction over Korean subjects should extend into Gando, and invaded Gando in force in August 1907, which resulted in the Qing administration of China issuing a 13-point refutation asserting its claim to Jiandao.

As the Korean boundary dispute with China and the large population of ethnic Koreans in Gando was no secret to anyone in Northeast Asia, it is likely that the Japanese proposed the Gando Convention as a potential threat to continue pressing to claim Gando for Korea as a part of the Japanese Empire if the concessions by China to Japan listed in the Convention were not granted.

== Terms ==
Treaties and agreements, while often lopsided in that era (see unequal treaties), often at least nominally included concessions for all parties signing such agreements. Japan agreed to recognize Gando as Chinese territory and to withdraw its forces from there back into Korea within two months of the date of the agreement. In return, China conceded exclusive railroad rights in Manchuria to Japan, among other things. The convention also contained provisions for the protection and rights of ethnic Koreans under Chinese rule.

== Korean claims ==

The Korean claim is partly based on what is perceived (on the Korean side) to be an ambiguity in the 1712 boundary agreement between the Qing Dynasty (which ruled China at the time) and the Joseon Dynasty (which ruled Korea at the time); that actually did not become an issue again until about 150 years after the agreement was approved by both parties, when Manchuria and Gando was opened to Han Chinese migration by the Qing.

The other major part of the claim relies on the fact that by the time the Gando Convention was signed in 1909, the Korean Empire was not consulted and had no way of disputing the legitimacy of the treaty, as it was already a protectorate of the Japanese Empire and was essentially prevented from resolving or renegotiating the boundary dispute as an independent state.

The Gando Convention, like other unequal treaties (such as the Eulsa Treaty and the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910) dealing with Korean territory/governance or claims made by Imperial Japan, should thus be revoked and the boundary dispute rectified between Korea (though there is no stated consensus on which of the two current Koreas should be party to this) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

== In the modern era ==

When the Japanese occupation of Korea ended in August 1945, the Soviet administration in the north of Korea and the American administration in the south of Korea hampered any unified Korean attempt to recover Gando. However, Gando Convention was de jure nullified and North Korea started to control the area south of Paektu Mountain. 

In 1961, PR China claimed a boundary dozens of kilometers south of Mt. Paekdu. North Korea protested by publishing a national map with the claim on Gando included. However, the North Korean claim on Gando and the Chinese claim on the area south of Gando Convention line were not serious. Seriously disputed area was the area between Gando Convention line and Paektu Mountain.

Between 1962 and 1963, North Korea signed two treaties with China, which settled the boundary between the two at the Yalu/Amnok (Chinese/Korean names) and Tumen Rivers, and stipulated that around three-fifths of Heaven Lake at the peak of Mt. Baekdu would go to North Korea, and two-fifths to China.

However, the boundary between North Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China continued to be contested, in spite of the 1963 agreement. In response to North Korea&#x27;s perceived lack of support in the Sino-Soviet split, China demanded that North Korea cede its portion of the peak of Mt. Baekdu to China, and between March 1968 and March 1969, a number of border clashes between North Korean forces and Chinese forces took place in the Mt. Baekdu region. PR China wanted to restore the Gando Convention boundary. Chinese demands for the rest of Mt. Baekdu were eventually dropped in 1970 in order to repair relations between North Korea and China. China has recognized North Korea&#x27;s sovereignty over some 80% of the islands in the Yalu/Amnok and Tumen Rivers, and also accepted North Korea&#x27;s control of some 90% of the mouth of the Yalu/Amnok River. While not openly discussed anymore, it would appear that the 1963 agreement is only something of a framework and not exactly a binding contract for either North Korea or China.

South Korea did not recognize these agreements, but did not made a serious attempt to assert Korean sovereignty on Gando either. South Korea did not officially renounce its claim on Gando, but the Sino-Korean boundary on South Korean national map loosely follows the 1961 line except for Mt. Baekdu, and largely accepts this boundary on the map as de facto boundary.

In 2004, the South Korean government issued the following statement: &quot;Our government takes the position that the 1909 Gando Convention, signed by Japan illegally without Korea&#x27;s consent, is null and void, to the extent that the Eulsa Treaty, which deprived Korea of its diplomatic rights in 1905, is a null-and-void treaty obtained through duress.&quot; On October 22, 2004, South Korean foreign affairs minister Ban Ki-moon also remarked on the voiding of the Gando Convention. Ban also stated that &quot;nullity of the Gando Convention does not automatically resolve Gando dispute and international politics harden our attempt to resolve Gando dispute&quot;

<text>Pyrrhotite (&quot;pyrrhos&quot; in Greek meaning &quot;flame-coloured&quot;&quot;)&quot; is an iron sulfide mineral with the formula Fe(1-x)S (x = 0 to 0.125). It is a nonstoichiometric variant of FeS, the mineral known as troilite.
Pyrrhotite is also called magnetic pyrite, because the color is similar to pyrite and it is weakly magnetic. The magnetism decreases as the iron content increases, and troilite is non-magnetic. Pyrrhotite is generally tabular and brassy/bronze in color with a metallic luster. The mineral occurs with mafic igneous rocks like norites, and may form from pyrite during metamorphic processes. Pyrrhotite is associated and mined with other sulfide minerals like pentlandite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and magnetite, and has been found globally. 


==Structure==
Pyrrhotite exists as a number of polytypes of hexagonal or monoclinic crystal symmetry; several polytypes often occur within the same specimen. Their structure is based on the NiAs unit cell. As such, Fe occupies an octahedral site and the sulfide centers occupy trigonal prismatic sites.

Materials with the NiAs structure often are non-stoichiometric because they lack up to 1/8th fraction of the metal ions, creating vacancies. One of such structures is pyrrhotite-4C (Fe7S8). Here &quot;4&quot; indicates that iron vacancies define a superlattice that is 4 times larger than the unit cell in the &quot;C&quot; direction. The C direction is conventionally chosen parallel to the main symmetry axis of the crystal; this direction usually corresponds to the largest lattice spacing. Other polytypes include: pyrrhotite-5C (Fe9S10), 6C (Fe11S12), 7C (Fe9S10) and 11C (Fe10S11). Every polytype can have monoclinic (M) or hexagonal (H) symmetry, and therefore some sources label them, for example, not as 6C, but 6H or 6M depending on the symmetry.
The monoclinic forms are stable at temperatures below 254 °C, whereas the hexagonal forms are stable above that temperature. The exception is for those with high iron content, close to the troilite composition (47 to 50% atomic percent iron) which exhibit hexagonal symmetry.

==Magnetic properties==
The ideal FeS lattice, such as that of troilite, is non-magnetic. Magnetic properties vary with Fe content. More Fe-rich, hexagonal pyrrhotites are antiferromagnetic. However, the Fe-deficient, monoclinic Fe7S8 is ferrimagnetic. The ferromagnetism which is widely observed in pyrrhotite is therefore attributed to the presence of relatively large concentrations of iron vacancies (up to 20%) in the crystal structure. Vacancies lower the crystal symmetry. Therefore, monoclinic forms of pyrrhotite are in general more defect-rich than the more symmetrical hexagonal forms, and thus are more magnetic. Monoclinic pyrrhotite undergoes a magnetic transition known as the Besnus transition at 30 K that leads to a loss of magnetic remanence. The saturation magnetization of pyrrhotite is 0.12 tesla.
== Identification ==

=== Physical properties ===
Pyrrhotite is brassy, bronze, or dark brown in color with a metallic luster and uneven or subconchoidal fracture. Pyrrhotite may be confused with other brassy sulfide minerals like pyrite, chalcopyrite, or pentlandite. Certain diagnostic characteristics can be used for identification in hand samples. Unlike other common brassy-colored sulfide minerals, pyrrhotite is typically magnetic (varies inversely with iron content). On the Mohs hardness scale, pyrrhotite ranges from 3.5 to 4, compared to 6 to 6.5 for pyrite. Streak can be used when properties between pyrrhotite and other sulfide minerals are similar. Pyrrhotite displays a dark grey to black streak. Pyrite will display a greenish black to brownish black streak, chalcopyrite will display a greenish black streak, and pentlandite leaves a pale bronze-brown streak. Pyrrhotite generally displays massive to granular crystal habit, and may show tabular/prismatic or hexagonal crystals which are sometimes iridescent.

Diagnostic characteristics in hand sample include: brassy/bronze color with a grey/black streak, tabular or hexagonal crystals which show iridescence, subconchoidal fracture, metallic luster, and magnetic. 

=== Optical properties ===
Pyrrhotite is an opaque mineral and will therefore not transmit light. As a result, pyrrhotite will display extinction when viewed under plane polarized light and cross polarized light, making identification with petrographic polarizing light microscopes difficult. Pyrrhotite, and other opaque minerals can be identified optically using a reflected light ore microscope. The following optical properties are representative of polished/puck sections using ore microscopy:

Pyrrhotite typically appears as anhedral, granular aggregates and is cream-pink to brownish in color. Weak to strong reflection pleochroism which may be seen along grain boundaries. Pyrrhotite has similar polishing hardness to pentlandite (medium), is softer than pyrite, and harder than chalcopyrite. Pyrrhotite will not display twinning or internal reflections, and its strong anisotropy from yellow to greenish-gray or grayish-blue is characteristic.

Diagnostic characteristics in polished section include: anhedral aggregates, cream-pink to brown in color and strong anisotropy.

==Occurrence==
Pyrrhotite is a rather common trace constituent of mafic igneous rocks especially norites. It occurs as segregation deposits in layered intrusions associated with pentlandite, chalcopyrite and other sulfides. It is an important constituent of the Sudbury intrusion (1.85 Ga old meteorite impact crater in Ontario, Canada) where it occurs in masses associated with copper and nickel mineralisation. It also occurs in pegmatites and in contact metamorphic zones. Pyrrhotite is often accompanied by pyrite, marcasite and magnetite. 

== Formation ==
Pyrrhotite requires both iron and sulfur to form. Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth&#x27;s continental crust (average abundance of 5.63 % or 56,300 mg/kg in the crust), and so the majority of rocks have sufficient iron abundance to form pyrrhotite. However, because sulfur is less abundant (average abundance of 0.035 % or 350 mg/kg in the crust), the formation of pyrrhotite is generally controlled by sulfur abundance. Also, the mineral pyrite is both the most common and most abundant sulfide mineral in the Earth&#x27;s crust. If rocks containing pyrite undergo metamorphism, there is a gradual release of volatile components like water and sulfur from pyrite. The loss of sulfur causes pyrite to recrystallize into pyrrhotite.

Pyrite also decomposes into pyrrhotite in hot reductive technogenic environments, such as blast furnaces and direct coal liquefaction (in which it is an important catalyst).

Pyrrhotite can also form near black smoker hydrothermal vents. Black smokers release high sulfur concentrations onto the sea floor, and when the surrounding rocks are metamorphosed, pyrrhotite can crystallize. Later tectonic processes uplift the metamorphic rocks and expose pyrrhotite to the Earth&#x27;s surface.

== Distribution ==

=== United States ===

Pyrrhotite occurs in a variety of locations in the United States. In the eastern United States, pyrrhotite occurs in highly metamorphosed rock that forms a belt along the Appalachian Mountains. Pyrrhotite-bearing rocks are generally unseen in the central United States as the area is unmetamorphosed and underlain by sedimentary rocks which do not contain pyrrhotite. Discontinuous belts that contain pyrrhotite are present in the western United States along the Sierra Nevada mountain range and Cascade Range extending into the northwestern United States. Pyrrhotite may also be found west and south of Lake Superior.

== Mining locations worldwide ==
The following are some of the locations worldwide where pyrrhotite has been reported during mining:

=== Canada ===
=== US ===
=== Australia ===
=== Brazil ===
=== Italy ===
=== Kosovo ===
== Etymology and history ==
Named in 1847 by Ours-Pierre-Armand Petit-Dufrénoy. &quot;Pyrrhotite&quot; is derived from the Greek word πνρρό, &quot;&quot;pyrrhos&quot;&quot;, meaning flame-colored.

==Issues==

If pyrrhotite-containing rocks are crushed and used as aggregate within concrete, then the pyrrhotite creates a problem in the production of concrete. Pyrrhotite has been linked to crumbling concrete basements in Quebec, Massachusetts and Connecticut when local quarries included it in their concrete mixtures. Many houses in Ireland, particularly in County Donegal, have also been affected by inclusion of rocks containing pyrrhotite in concrete blocks. The iron sulfide it contains can naturally react with oxygen and water, and over time pyrrhotite breaks down into sulfuric acid and secondary minerals like ettringite, thaumasite and gypsum. These secondary products occupy a larger volume than pyrrhotite, which expands and cracks the concrete leading to home foundation or block failure.

== Uses ==
Other than a source of sulfur, pyrrhotite does not have specific applications. It is generally not a valuable mineral unless significant nickel, copper, or other metals are present. Iron is seldom extracted from pyrrhotite due to a complicated metallurgical process It is mined primarily because it is associated with pentlandite, a sulfide mineral that can contain significant amounts of nickel and cobalt. When found in mafic and ultramafic rocks, pyrrhotite can be a good indicator of economic nickel deposits.

<doc id="1093894" wikidata="Q782908" url="?curid=1093894" title="Kiasu">
<text>Kiasu () is a term derived from the Hokkien “kia” meaning afraid and “su” meaning to lose. It is commonly defined as “the fear of losing,” and is directed at a person who behaves competitively to either attain their goal or to get ahead of others. The term has been part of the Singlish (formally known as Colloquial Singaporean English) lexicon spoken in Singapore since the 1980s. 

Since then, Kiasuism has settled into Singapore society and has become part of the cultural norms such as within the local education system or the queuing culture. Nevertheless, Kiasuism still exists in other countries, which have their own variation of the word. Acts of Kiasuism can be either positive or negative depending on the intent of the person committing the act and on the act&#x27;s end result. Kiasuism has had a notable history since its move away from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) army barracks to the streets of Singapore, from the emergence of &quot;Mr. Kiasu&quot; to government attempts to curb Kiasuism. 

Others have considered Kiasuism as something positive and beneficial. Among others, factors include the mentality to drive many Singaporeans to work harder and strive for success, which helped the country to become one of the most prosperous and competitive countries in the world. This mindset has also fostered a culture of innovation and continuous improvement, encourage people to be prepared for any situation, and promote a culture of safety and risk management. This has led many Singaporeans to be careful and cautious, which has helped to improve overall safety in the country.

==Etymology and usage==
The word is derived from the Hokkien language, with “kia” meaning “fear” and “su” meaning “to lose”. It is often used to denote an anxious and competitive attitude that arises from fear of missing out. It highlights one’s insistent want to be better than others.

Kiasu can be used as an adjective in a “descriptive state” to describe a person who wants to get ahead of others. Kiasu can also be used as a verb to describe an action a person did out of fear of losing out, and as a “feeling state” when a person has the desire to act in a way that is kiasu. Kiasuism is the action noun form of kiasu.

Kiasu is part of the vocabulary of Singapore&#x27;s colloquial language, Singlish. Singlish is an English-based creole language comprising vocabulary from Chinese languages such as Hokkien, Teochew, and Cantonese, as well as English and Malay, and to a lesser extent Tamil and Mandarin. The latter four are Singapore’s four official languages. However, the language represents a homogeneous Singaporean way of thinking, rather than a mixture of the various cultures from which the specific languages originate. The word reflects a Singaporean mindset and has become ingrained in Singapore’s national culture.

Kiasu is also similar in etymology to another Singlish term: &quot;kiasi&quot; which literally translates to “fear of death”. Both terms are used to describe similar attitudes, but have almost opposite uses. &quot;Kiasu&quot; or &quot;kiasuism&quot; means taking extreme measures to achieve success, whereas &quot;kiasi&quot; or &quot;kiasiism&quot; means to take extreme, risk-avoidant measures.

Academics have identified that kiasuism has two different types of tactics: “kiasu-positive” tactics and “kiasu-negative” tactics. Whether an act of kiasuism involves positive or negative tactics depends on the initial intention, the results of the act, and whether the amount of effort put into the kiasu tactic matches the intended result. Kiasu-positive tactics involve an individual using more effort to attain their goals, with the end reward justifying the means. Kiasu-negative tactics involve an individual gaining an advantage by putting others down, often harming themselves and others, with the end reward not justifying the means.

===Kiasu-like traits in other countries===
Studies conducted on residents of Australia and the United States have concluded that kiasuism exists outside of Singapore. A study conducted among Australians uncovered a lack of notable distinction between the “kiasu” behaviour in Singaporeans and Australians, meaning that kiasuism is not an exclusively Singaporean trait. The term “Par Chup Sue” () from Hong Kong is a close synonym of kiasu; its literal translation is “scared to lose out”. Since kiasu is derived from a Chinese dialect, it is unsurprising that similar sentiments to kiasu are found in Chinese vocabulary and values. For instance, the Chinese phrase: “Don’t let your kids lose in the beginning” (), has a similar meaning to kiasu.

Internationally, terms like FOMO (fear of missing out) and hyper-competitiveness have been used in similar situations as kiasu. However, both terms are not direct synonyms. While both FOMO and kiasuism possess the compulsive want to be connected with others, FOMO lacks the competitive element of kiasuism. Hyper-competitiveness does share its competitive element with kiasu. However, hyper-competitiveness and FOMO are better defined as unintentionally “maladaptive” and hard to control while kiasuism is a controllable and intentional tactic to get above. A closer English synonym to kiasu is the idiom “keeping up with the Joneses”. The &quot;Merriam-Webster&quot; dictionary defines this term as a person showing that they are &quot;as good as other people by getting what they have and doing what they do”. However, this term differs from kiasu in terms of compulsivity. The lack of close synonyms to kiasu outside of Chinese values and vocabulary can be attributed to Singapore being more attentive to kiasu tactics compared to other countries.

== History ==
According to Annetta Ayyavoo and Brendan Tennakoon, the emergence of kiasu behaviour among Singaporeans is likely due to the country being an immigrant nation. Since immigrants typically lacked education and were of lower social classes, they had to be overtly competitive to earn a sufficient living.

The word “kiasu” first emerged in the 1980s in its original form: “kian su”, and was used among men completing their compulsory national service. “Kian su” was used to refer to soldiers who were afraid of failure. Eventually, kiasu entered the vocabulary of everyday Singaporeans. 

In the 1990s, the term was mostly used to describe negative tactics, particularly due to the increasing local and international popularity of the character Mr. Kiasu, who was known for his exaggerated kiasuism. The Singapore government grew concerned that the rest of the world would have a negative image of Singaporeans. As such, the government began implementing methods to target and fix kiasuism. For instance, the 1993 edition of the government&#x27;s &quot;National Courtesy Campaign&quot; had the tagline “If we could only see ourselves sometimes”, in hope that the Singaporean population would make an effort to exhibit less kiasu behaviour. Furthermore, in a parliamentary debate in 1990, Lee Siew-Choh, a member of parliament, stated that he hoped that ministers would not fall ill with the “kiasu syndrome” which the government had been actively preaching against. This speech marked the first time the word “kiasu” was used in a parliamentary setting.

Despite their efforts, the government still found kiasuism to be a problem past the 1990s. For example, during the 2012 National Day Speech, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, told the audience to be wary of “ugly Singaporean” behaviour in reference to kiasuism among other negative behaviours. Four years later, in 2016, a member of parliament claimed that kiasuism was inhibiting innovation in Singapore. Moreover, according to a National Values Assessment survey conducted in 2012 which surveyed 2000 people, “kiasu” and “competitive” appeared as the two highest answers on a list of how Singaporeans would label their society.

Rather than purely viewing kiasuism as a negative behaviour, Singaporeans have begun to embrace kiasuism as part of their national identity. For example, in 2017, the supermarket chain Giant, sent out an online quiz to find out which town in Singapore was the most kiasu. The quiz received 57,000 entries, with Tampines winning the competition. As a prize, Giant gave away free goods such as milo and canned drinks to Tampines residents.

Kiasu also reached prominence in its international status when it entered the online version of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) in March 2007. In 2015, kiasu was OED’s Word of the Day.

== Cultural contexts ==
In February 1989, the &quot;Report of the Advisory Council on Youths&quot; announced that kiasuism played an important role in shaping Singaporean youth’s perspective towards various facets of life such as education and work. While kiasuism is a behaviour taken on by an individual, this behaviour is also part of the Singaporean shared “cultural norm”. This means that in social situations where competition is required, Singaporeans would feel obliged to adopt a kiasu behaviour because they presume that everyone else would do so too. For example, the inflow of foreign talent into Singapore has convinced Singaporeans, collectively, of the need to be more competitive to be on top of their field of work. To match Singapore’s high quality of living, Singaporeans find themselves pressured to embrace kiasuism as a means to improve their studies, be eligible for benefits at their work, and have an ideal personal life.

=== Education culture ===
Kiasuism is noticed in regard to Singaporean attitudes towards education. Due to the elite nature of Singaporean society, success is often measured by how well one performs at school. Therefore, to get ahead of others and be successful, students perform kiasu acts such as the kiasu-negative tactic of sandbagging. In the context of Singaporean schools, sandbagging refers to students lying that they have not studied much hoping it convinces other students to not put in too much effort. Other tactics include attempting to secure more and higher quality study materials and attending tuition, both of which can be seen as either positive or negative depending on intent.

Many Singaporean parents equate kiasuism as a means of achieving academic excellence. Hence, children are pressured by their parents to be kiasu in order to be high scorers. For example, in 2014, the &quot;Singapore Department of Statistics&quot; found that almost S$1.1 billion was collectively spent on external tuition classes by parents every year to ensure that their children would fare better than other students. Moreover, a study in 1992 indicated that the percentage of students receiving private tuition rose from 19% in the early 1980s, to 32% by the 1990s. Parents would send their children of preschool age to enrichment classes as well, to provide them with a head-start against other students. Parents have also taken great measures to ensure that their children go to more reputable schools, such as by joining churches affiliated with the schools, donating large amounts to the schools, and lying about their home addresses. For example, in 2015, a couple provided a falsified home address that was 1km away from the school to secure a position for their child during Phase 2C of the Primary 1 registration exercise, which gave spaces to children who lived close to the school.

=== Queuing culture ===
Kiasuism also plays a primary role in Singapore’s queueing culture. A notable example of this queuing culture is seen from the “Hello Kitty fever” in 2019. When McDonald’s launched a limited edition carrier &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;, a famous Japanese fictional character, Singaporeans began to queue hours before the launch to be one of the first to get a carrier. To get around the limit of two carriers per transaction, some Singaporeans joined the queue a second time to purchase more of the good. According to interviews by &quot;The New Paper&quot;, customers revealed that they were unsure of what to do with the carrier after their purchase. Others were selling the carriers for more than five times the original price on Carousell, an online community marketplace. Queuing culture highlights how kiasuism, particularly kiasu-negative tactics, has become a cultural norm in Singapore. An individual would get into a random queue they notice because the kiasu mindset ingrained within Singaporeans will convince them that the queue is for something valuable. Kiasuism makes people idly stand in lines just because they want to fit into the status quo and not lose out in what they perceive as an opportunity.

== In popular works ==
“Kiasu” has also found itself used in popular Singaporean works, such as in its usage of the 1987 play: Army Daze.

=== Mr. Kiasu ===
The word is most prominently associated with the “Mr. Kiasu” comic book series published in the 1990s created by Johnny Lau and written by Yu Cheng and James Suresh. The book series followed the lead character, Mr. Kiasu, who was known for showcasing extreme kiasu tactics. Singaporeans were able to relate to the character because he was able to well-encompass the kiasu characteristic that many of them possessed, even if the character&#x27;s kiasu tactics were exaggerated. Following the character’s quick success, McDonald’s worked with Lau to produce and promote the “kiasu burger” for a limited time in 1993, successfully selling 1.2 million burgers. Due to the books’ popularity, in 2001, the local broadcasting company, Mediacorp, produced a live-action sitcom, &quot;Mr. Kiasu&quot;, based on the books. There were also numerous pieces of merchandise of the character that was produced, such as mugs, watches, and stationery.

<text>&quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;, also known as &quot;&quot;, is a Christmas carol that has been attributed to various authors, including John Francis Wade (1711–1786), John Reading (1645–1692), King John IV of Portugal (1604–1656), and anonymous Cistercian monks. The earliest printed version is in a book published by Wade. A manuscript by Wade, dating to 1751, is held by Stonyhurst College in Lancashire.

The original four verses of the hymn were extended to a total of eight, and these have been translated into many languages. In 1841, the English Catholic priest Frederick Oakeley translated the hymn into English as &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful&quot;, which became widespread in English-speaking countries.

==History==

===Text===
The original text of the hymn has been from time to time attributed to various groups and individuals, including St. Bonaventure in the 13th century or King John IV of Portugal in the 17th, though it was more commonly believed that the text was written by Cistercian monks – the German, Portuguese or Spanish provinces of that order having at various times been credited. A parody of the chorus (&quot;venite apotemus&quot;) was current before 1542, when it appears in chapter 41 of Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Gargantua&quot;.

In modern English hymnals, the text is usually credited to John Francis Wade, whose name appears on the earliest printed versions. Wade, an English Catholic, lived in exile in France and made a living as a copyist of musical manuscripts which he found in libraries. He often signed his copies, possibly because his calligraphy was so beautiful that his clients requested this . In 1751 he published a printed compilation of his manuscript copies, &quot;Cantus Diversi pro Dominicis et Festis per annum&quot;. This is the first printed source for &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot;.

The version published by Wade consisted of four Latin verses. Later in the 18th century, the French Catholic priest wrote an additional three verses in Latin. Another anonymous Latin verse is rarely printed. 
The text has been translated innumerable times into English. The most common version today is a combination of one of Frederick Oakeley&#x27;s translations of the original four verses, and William Thomas Brooke&#x27;s translation of the three additional verses. It was first published in &quot;Murray&#x27;s Hymnal&quot; in 1852. Oakeley originally titled the song &quot;Ye Faithful, approach ye&quot; when it was sung at his Margaret Chapel in Marylebone (London), before it was altered to its current form. The song was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Portuguese Hymn&quot; after the Duke of Leeds, in 1795, heard a version of it sung at the Portuguese embassy in London, now Our Lady of the Assumption and St Gregory, Warwick Street. McKim and Randell nonetheless argue for Wade&#x27;s authorship of the most popular English-language version. Bennett Zon offers limited support for that argument, although he also suggests that the author may instead have been someone known to Wade.

===Tune===
Besides John Francis Wade, the tune has been attributed to several musicians, from John Reading and his son, to Handel, and even the German composer Christoph Willibald Gluck. The Portuguese composer Marcos Portugal as well as King John IV of Portugal have also been credited. Thomas Arne, whom Wade knew, is another possible composer. There are several similar musical themes written around that time, though it can be hard to determine whether these were written in imitation of the hymn, whether the hymn was based on them, or whether they are totally unconnected.

===Published versions===
The hymn was first published by John Francis Wade in his collection &quot;Cantus Diversi&quot; (1751), with four Latin verses, and music set in the traditional square notation used for medieval liturgical music. This version is in triple meter, contrary to modern versions. It was published again in the 1760 edition of &quot;Evening Offices of the Church&quot;. It also appeared in Samuel Webbe&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on the Church Plain Chant&quot; (1782).
The hymn tune also made its way to the Sacred Harp tradition, appearing as &quot;Hither Ye Faithful, Haste with Songs of Triumph&quot; in an 1860 collection.
With &quot;Herbei, o ihr Gläub&#x27;gen&quot; a German translation of the Latin text was published in 1823 by Friedrich Heinrich Ranke.

==Lyrics==
These are the original four Latin verses as published by Wade, along with a literal translation and their metrical English translation by Frederick Oakeley.

These are the additional Latin verses composed in the 18th century. The first three verses have translations by William Thomas Brooke, while the others have English prose translations:

===Claims of Jacobite connections===
Although, as previously stated, the hymn’s exact sources and origins remain unproven, there is universal agreement among musicologists that it was through the efforts of Catholic layman and music copyist John Francis Wade that it first appeared in print. Wade himself fled to France after the Jacobite rising of 1745 was crushed, and his liturgical books were often decorated with Jacobite imagery (for context, the aim of the rebellion had been to restore a Catholic monarch – Charles Edward Stuart, popularly known as “Bonnie Prince Charlie” – to the throne of England). These aspects of Wade’s life and political leanings have given rise to speculation that he might have intended for &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; to be a ciphered birth ode to the Jacobite’s Young Pretender.

This theory regarding the hymn’s meaning has been most recently proposed by Professor Bennett Zon, head of music at Durham University. It essentially holds that &quot;the song’s original Latin version was actually a coded rallying cry for the Stewart cause&quot;. Elements of this theory include:

*The as-yet-unproven but popular claim that &quot;Bethlehem&quot; was a common Jacobite cipher for England.
*The claim (also currently unproven) that Wade deliberately meant for the title &quot;Regem Angelorum&quot; – which is found in the hymn’s original Latin lyrics and translates literally to &quot;King of Angels&quot; – to refer to the king of England via a pun on the Latin words &quot;Angelorum&quot; (&quot;of the angels&quot;) and &quot;Anglorum&quot; (&quot;of the English&quot;).
*The fact that during the mid-18th century some English Roman Catholic liturgical books would place &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; physically close to prayers for the would-be king in exile.

Proponents of this theory interpret the notions and circumstances described above as evidence that the lyrics of &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; are meant to be &quot;a call to arms for faithful Jacobites to return with triumphant joy to England (Bethlehem) and venerate the king of angels, that is, the English king (Bonnie Prince Charlie).” However, certain historical circumstances would seem to disprove or at least problematize the Jacobite ode theory. Namely:

# The absence of any textual evidence that can conclusively prove that Wade explicitly composed &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; as a piece of political propaganda. In the absence of such evidence, the Jacobite imagery found in Wade’s books might be merely an expression of the author’s idiosyncratic blend of political and religious thought, which in turn might have reflected the sentiments of Catholic Jacobites as a group.
# Sources that credit the hymn’s composition to Wade overlook the fact that the exact origins of &quot;Adeste Fideles&quot; are uncertain. It is not known whether Wade might have simply copied the hymn from other sources (for instance, it could have been composed by Cistercian monks and eventually sung at the Portuguese embassy chapel in London), or to what extent he might have innovated on the contributions of the hymn’s other plausible authors.
# Most of the hymn’s original lyrics are an almost-verbatim expression of Roman Catholic dogmas regarding the person of Jesus Christ. As stated elsewhere in this article, the hymn takes almost all its contents from Bible verses and the Nicene Creed. To Irish musicologist William H. Grattan Flood, it is so readily evident that the hymn is merely an artistic expression of the Catholic spiritual and intellectual tradition that he concludes that the words and music of the song &quot;are to be attributed to a Catholic source and for Catholic worship&quot;.

==Performance==
In performance, verses are often omitted – either because the hymn is too long in its entirety or because the words are unsuitable for the day on which they are sung. For example, the eighth anonymous verse is only sung on Epiphany, if at all; while the last verse of the original is normally reserved for Christmas Midnight Mass, Mass at Dawn or Mass during the Day, or if sung on a different day the line &quot;Born this happy morning&quot; is changed to &quot;Born for our salvation&quot;.

In the United Kingdom and United States it is often sung today in an arrangement by Sir David Willcocks, which was originally published in 1961 by Oxford University Press in the first book in the Carols for Choirs series. This arrangement makes use of the basic harmonisation from &quot;The English Hymnal&quot; but adds a soprano descant in verse six (verse three in the original) with its reharmonised organ accompaniment, and a last verse harmonisation in verse seven (verse four in the original), which is sung in unison.

This carol has served as the penultimate hymn sung at the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols by the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, after the last lesson from Chapter 1 of the Gospel of John.

Adeste Fideles is traditionally the final anthem during Midnight Mass at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican.

<doc id="1093912" wikidata="Q1432188" url="?curid=1093912" title="Rorippa">
<text>Rorippa is a globally distributed genus in the family Brassicaceae, with species occurring on all continents except for Antarctica. &quot;Rorippa&quot; species are natively distributed in the Northern Hemisphere through Eurasia and North America, and dispersed into the Southern Hemisphere through long-distance dispersal. &quot;Rorippa&quot; species are annual to perennial herbs, usually with yellow flowers and a peppery flavour. They are known commonly as yellowcresses.

== Description ==
As a close relative of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, &quot;Rorippa&quot; has emerged as a group of valuable model organisms for investigating various biological processes. Researchers have utilized &quot;Rorippa&quot; to study developmental phenomena such as heterophylly, weediness, and vegetative regeneration. For example, heterophylly is the ability of plants to produce different leaf forms in response to contrasting environments, such as aerial or submerged conditions. This may incur anatomical or physiological changes and facilitate adaptation to the amphibious lifestyle in &quot;Rorippa,&quot;

Additionally, &quot;Rorippa&quot; has been employed to explore stress tolerance mechanisms, including responses to submergence, heavy metals, high-altitudes, and herbivory (specifically the mustard aphid). For example, &quot;Rorippa amphibia&quot; can escape submergence through elongation, while &quot;Rorippa sylvestris&quot; or &quot;Rorippa palustris&quot; can photosynthesize underwater and exhibits a hyponastic response (positive growth response to gravity), demonstrating a quiescence strategy (a period of reduced activity during unfavorable conditions).

Furthermore, &quot;Rorippa&quot; has served as a model system for studying biological invasion, with research focusing on evolutionary, ecological, and historical aspects.

== Ecology ==
Most &quot;Rorippa&quot; species thrive in moist or wet environments like ditches, meadows, waterfronts, and wetlands, highlighting their exceptional tolerance to flooding. This facilitates the dispersal of their seeds or vegetative propagules by floods over short to long ranges. For example, their fruits with seeds can remain viable for up to 60 days while floating in water. The aquatic or marshy habitats of &quot;Rorippa&quot; often overlap with those of migratory shorebirds, which could potentially carry seeds or fragments over long distances, establishing new populations far from the source. Furthermore, several adaptations, like the mucilage coating or hollows on their seeds, and their ability to self-fertilize and reproduce clonally, might also contribute to their long-distance dispersal.

&quot;Rorippa&quot; species are known for colonizing disturbed or wet areas first. They serve as valuable indicators of hydrophytic (water-loving) vegetation types. According to the National Wetland Plant List (NWPL) for the United States, several &quot;Rorippa&quot; species are classified as wetland indicators, with a high probability of occurring in Obligate (OBL) or Facultative Wetland (FACW) categories. For instance, nearly 55% of the 22 North American &quot;Rorippa&quot; species are categorized as OBL wetland indicators, highlighting their strong association with wet environments. This characteristic makes &quot;Rorippa&quot; plants a valuable tool for wetland establishment, restoration, and enhancement efforts.

== Example ==
Rorippa aquatica, a North American lakecress, is a valuable model organism for studying plant development and adaptation. It exhibits striking heterophylly, altering its leaf shape in response to environmental conditions like submergence, temperature, and light. In low-light submerged environments, for example, it develops finely dissected leaves. While in terrestrial conditions, it forms simple leaves with serrated edges. This leaf shape variation is controlled by the levels of plant hormones including gibberellin (GA) and ethylene, as well as the expression of specific genes, such as &quot;KNOX1&quot; or &quot;RaSPCH/RaMUTE,&quot; providing an efficient way for leaves to absorb sunlight underwater. The species is also used to study vegetative propagation as it can regenerate from leaf fragments. Its close phylogenetic relationship to &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; and its recently sequenced allotetraploid genome make it a powerful tool for genetic and genomic research.

Rorippa elata is a type of plant that has adapted to live in high-altitude mountain environments. It can adjust its traits, like flowering time and chemical defenses, to survive in different conditions. The plant&#x27;s ability to adapt is also linked to its polyploid nature, which seems to have played a role in its successful colonization of high-altitudes during periods of historical climate change.

Rorippa palustris, a short-lived and self-pollinating herb, is a ruderal weed that has expanded into disturbed wetland areas across the world. A key characteristic of &quot;R. palustris&quot;, and other ruderal plants, is its short life cycle. Genetic studies have shown that mutations in the &quot;CRY2&quot; gene contribute to this early-flowering trait. These mutations lead to a constitutively active &quot;CRY2&quot; protein, which overrides the need for vernalization (a cold period) and allows the plant to flower early, even under short-day conditions.

== List of species ==
There are about 75 to 85 species in the genus. About 70% of &quot;Rorippa&quot; are polyploids, and 90% of them are endemic to specific continents. A few of &quot;Rorippa&quot; species are widely distributed and invasive, including &quot;Rorippa amphibia&quot;, &quot;Rorippa dubia&quot;, &quot;Rorippa indica&quot;, &quot;Rorippa palustris&quot;, and &quot;Rorippa sylvestris&quot;. Plants of &quot;Rorippa palustris&quot; can be found globally, making it one of the most successful weeds in the world.

<doc id="1093917" wikidata="Q2624638" url="?curid=1093917" title="Corwin of Amber">
<text>Corwin, a Prince of Amber, is the main character in the first five books of Roger Zelazny&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot;. He is the second son of Oberon and Faiella, and the father of Merlin. Within the novels, much of the action centers on Corwin and his family as they plot against one another conspiring to become the King of Amber.

In the first book of the series, &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot;, Corwin is identified as the eldest heir to the throne who has a legitimate claim. The matter of succession is hotly (and frequently) contested within the family, particularly during the prolonged absence of Oberon, and loyalties constantly shift among the undecided.

Corwin has dark hair and green eyes. His colors are black and silver (alternately gray), and his symbol is a silver rose. Corwin&#x27;s favoured weapon is his sword Grayswandir, and his use of magic is extremely limited. While a few of his siblings exceed him in certain skills, such as arms (Benedict), strength (Gérard), and magic (Brand, Fiona, and Bleys), Corwin is well-balanced in most and is the best leader of them all. He also exemplifies stamina throughout the series.

Corwin is a quick and strategic thinker. Like his brothers and sisters, he boasts remarkable endurance and regeneration abilities, even more so than his siblings. While Corwin acts with a strong personal code of honor, he is also extremely practical; he will not engage in a fight of principle unless he believes he has a chance to win, and he is perfectly willing to employ subterfuge to defeat an opponent.

==Overview==
Centuries before the opening of &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot;, while their father Oberon was still ruling in Amber, Corwin fought a duel (or, as Corwin referred to it later, &quot;a simultaneous decision to murder each other&quot;) with Eric and nearly died. Eric, fearing their father&#x27;s wrath, dumped Corwin in Elizabethan England during one of the recurrent plague outbreaks, most likely during one of the outbreaks in 1592 or 1603. Corwin recovered from the plague, but he suffered brain damage causing amnesia. He proceeded to live out several hundred years of Earth&#x27;s history as a soldier of fortune, physician, and songwriter until the 1970s when he was in a car accident and confined to a clinic. Waking with no memories at all, Corwin escapes and makes contact with his sister Florimel, and soon after his brother Random, using them to return to Amber and finally regain his past (by re-walking on the copy of the Pattern located in the underwater city Rebma).

Once Corwin&#x27;s memory returns, we learn that he is far from saintly. Like his siblings, he has created his own kingdom in Shadow to rule, calling it Avalon, and in doing so has cast shadows of himself and his kingdom around. While the original Avalon has been destroyed, in the shadow of Avalons his name is reviled for cruelty and arrogance. As Benedict says of the Avalon that he has adopted, acting as Lord Protector, &quot;young boys are not named Corwin here, nor am I brother to anyone of that name&quot;. Even in Lorraine, the shadow of a shadow where he first encounters the forces of Chaos, he is remembered as a tyrant and butcher. However, it is also implied that this image may be distorted, as it is from a shadow of Avalon in which the real Corwin never ruled. Even so, it seems that his centuries on Earth have somehow mellowed his character, if not his ambition.
For an in-depth plot summary of Corwin&#x27;s adventures following his time in the clinic, see &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot;, &quot;The Guns of Avalon&quot;, &quot;Sign of the Unicorn&quot;, &quot;The Hand of Oberon&quot;, and &quot;The Courts of Chaos&quot;.

==Grayswandir==
Grayswandir, also known as the Night Blade, is Corwin&#x27;s sword and it has a twin called Brand&#x27;s Werewindle, the Day Sword. Both Grayswandir and Werewindle are inscribed with portions of the Pattern of Amber, granting them some power over Shadow. In addition, Corwin is able to call Grayswandir to him while travelling in Shadow: while escaping imprisonment by his brother Eric, en route Corwin determines that Grayswandir will be found inside a hollow tree he spots along the way, despite the sword being within Amber at that point. Later, while visiting Tir-na Nog&#x27;th, the blade enables Corwin to speak to the shades there, who had previously been unaware of his presence; when Corwin fights the shade of Benedict, he also learns that Grayswandir can harm him, perhaps as a result of the Pattern force within or due to Tir-na Nog&#x27;th being a distorted shadow of Amber.

In the Amber short story &quot;Hall of Mirrors,&quot; Corwin revealed that Grayswandir and Werewindle were transformed spikards: Spikards are rings of power that existed before Amber and possibly even Chaos were created, and allow the bearer to tap into a power source somewhere in the Shadow.

The name Grayswandir echoes that of Graywand, the longsword of Fafhrd in Fritz Leiber&#x27;s tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Fafhrd naming consecutive swords all &quot;Graywand&quot; after losing each predecessor is the likely inspiration for the name of Grayswandir as it can reappear to Corwin after being lost.

==Corwin&#x27;s Pattern==
In &quot;The Courts of Chaos&quot;, Corwin inscribed a new pattern after he incorrectly concluded that Oberon&#x27;s attempt to repair the Primal Pattern had failed. He created his pattern in a shadow originally resembling the nearby Courts of Chaos; when his Pattern was complete, it brought a measure of order to that Shadow. Corwin&#x27;s Pattern created an additional emblem of Order, upsetting the balance of power between the original Pattern and the weakened Logrus of Chaos.

Corwin&#x27;s Pattern is somewhat different from the original Primal Pattern and the copies of it. It feels more benevolent than Amber&#x27;s Pattern and its Shadow copies; this is theorized by readers to be a result of Corwin&#x27;s mellowed personality and his experiences in Paris, France, which he drew on while creating his Pattern. Corwin&#x27;s Pattern treats its pattern ghosts as helpers rather than expendable tools.

It appears that the original Pattern wishes to incorporate Corwin&#x27;s Pattern into itself, to further its advantage over the Logrus and that Corwin&#x27;s Pattern is resisting its incursions, to the extent that the Pattern of Amber could not subdue the independence of Corwin&#x27;s without being sufficiently weakened to lay itself open to a counter-stroke from the Logrus of Chaos. Likewise, the Logrus seeks to destroy Corwin&#x27;s Pattern, since it represents an additional artifact of Order against Chaos (although not in accord with the Order of Amber&#x27;s Pattern) — but equally cannot do so without the risk of a counter-stroke from Amber&#x27;s Pattern. It is suggested Corwin&#x27;s Pattern may end up forming a third &quot;pole&quot; in the struggle between Order and Chaos, ultimately taking neither side and able to retain its independent existence against anything short of what will never happen, namely a combined assault from the Amber Pattern and Logrus.

== Reception ==
Jane M. Lindskold called Corwin of Amber one of Zelazny&#x27;s several &quot;poet protagonists&quot;, noting that &quot;Zelazny gives Corwin dimension beyond the usual sword-and-sorcery hero by giving us hints of what depths of feeling&quot; he is capable of, often through Corwin&#x27;s use of poetry and song.

Juan A. Prieto-Pablos notes that Corwin, like most of Zelazny&#x27;s heroes, is a privileged, immortal superhero on a mission to redeem himself from a past mistake.

==Corwin of Amber in popular culture==

In the game &quot;NetHack&quot;, Grayswandir appears as a powerful artifact silver saber that protects its wielder from hallucination.

In &quot;&quot;, typing in &quot;Corwin of Amber&quot; activates the game&#x27;s cheat codes. The summoning of non-human armies from another dimension to lay siege in the case of &quot;The Horde&quot; in the &quot;Warcraft&quot; series also closely mirror the events in the climax of &quot;Nine Princes in Amber&quot;.

In &quot;Lost Souls&quot;, the magical sword Grayswandir appears as a rare artifact longsword that destroys items of chaos on contact.

<text>Gail Kathryn Anderson-Dargatz (born November 14, 1963) is a Canadian novelist.

Anderson-Dargatz was born in Kamloops, British Columbia, and grew up in Salmon Arm. She studied creative writing at the University of Victoria and taught in the MFA program at UBC. She published her debut short story collection &quot;The Miss Hereford Stories&quot; in 1994, and received a nomination for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour in 1995.

Her first novel, &quot;The Cure for Death by Lightning&quot; (1996), was an experimental yet accessible work whose story unfolded partly through narrative and partly through a collection of recipes and household tips belonging to the narrator&#x27;s mother. A Canadian bestseller that year, it won the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize, and was nominated for the Giller Prize and the Books in Canada First Novel Award.

Her second novel, &quot;A Recipe for Bees&quot;, was published in 1998. Based on her own parents&#x27; early relationship, her process of researching the book led her parents to rekindle their romance after having divorced in 1981, and ultimately to their remarriage to each other. The book was a Giller Prize finalist in 1998.

She has since published the novels &quot;A Rhinestone Button&quot; (2002), &quot;Turtle Valley&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Spawning Grounds&quot; (2016).

<doc id="1093923" wikidata="Q203886" url="?curid=1093923" title="Tzimmes">
<text>Tzimmes, or tsimmes (, ), is a traditional Ashkenazi Jewish stew typically made from carrots and dried fruits such as prunes or raisins, often combined with other root vegetables (including yam).

Tzimmes is often part of the Rosh Hashanah meal, when it is traditional to eat sweet and honey-flavored dishes. Some cooks add chunks of meat (usually beef flank or brisket). The dish is cooked slowly over low heat and flavored with honey or sugar and sometimes cinnamon or other spices. 

The name is a Yiddish word that, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, may come from Middle High German . &quot;To make a big &quot;tzimmes&quot; over something&quot; is a Yinglish expression that means to make a big fuss, perhaps because of the slicing, mixing, and stirring that go into the preparation of the dish.

<doc id="1093930" wikidata="Q15516751" url="?curid=1093930" title="David Brudnoy">
<text>David Barry Brudnoy (June 5, 1940 – December 9, 2004) was an American talk radio host in Boston from 1976 to 2004. His radio talk show aired on WBZ radio and he espoused his libertarian views on a wide range of political issues in a courteous manner. Thanks to WBZ&#x27;s wide broadcast signal reach, he gained a following from across the United States as well as Canada. On December 9, 2004, he died from Merkel cell carcinoma after it had metastasized to his lungs and kidneys.

==Background, education and first career==
Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States, to a Jewish family, David Brudnoy was the only child of Doris and Harry Brudnoy. Harry was a dentist in the Minneapolis area, a profession he maintained for over 50 years. During his youth, David Brudnoy was known to be precocious, and in addition to reading a lot, he enjoyed collecting stamps. He was also interested in history, and thanks to the influence of his Aunt Kathie, with whom he was close for all of his life, he became interested in movies; he often attended them with her. Years later, Brudnoy would become known for his work as a film critic, and he remarked in his autobiography that his aunt had undoubtedly contributed to his success by taking him to so many films.

Although he did not articulate it at the time, he was also aware of certain homosexual attractions. Years later, he would detail the confusion he felt, discussing his teenage and college years in his 1997 autobiography, &quot;Life is Not a Rehearsal&quot;. During his childhood, Brudnoy and his family briefly lived in Macon, Georgia, and San Antonio, Texas; his father had enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and the moves were so that he could be near army bases. Brudnoy first attended college in 1958, receiving a BA in Japanese Studies from Yale in New Haven. He also received MAs from Harvard and Brandeis, and a PhD from Brandeis, focusing on East Asian studies and history. He received an honorary doctorate from Emerson College in 1996.

As a professor, Brudnoy taught classes or was a guest lecturer at many major colleges and universities throughout Boston and New England, as well as in Texas: Boston University, Boston College, Northeastern University, Merrimack College, University of Rhode Island, Harvard Kennedy School at Harvard University, as well as Texas Southern University. He was respected as an educator: student evaluations for his courses at Boston University indicate that they were very well received, and former students were among those who wrote eloquent tributes to him when he died. According to those students, he was such a devoted educator that even as he was dying, he made certain to finish grading their term papers.

==Broadcast career==
Brudnoy began a career in broadcast commentary in 1971 on Boston&#x27;s local PBS television station, WGBH-TV. In 1976, he took over as host of his friend Avi Nelson&#x27;s radio show on WHDH, in the midst of the city&#x27;s unrest over forced busing and desegregation in schools. He took to the job with ease, and increasingly gained popularity. From 1981 to 1986, he appeared on former Top 40 station WRKO, which was now news and talk, before moving to local stalwart WBZ. The top-rated talk radio host in New England, he appeared in a regular weekday evening slot until his retirement. At the end of his career, Brudnoy was, according to WBZ Radio&#x27;s promotional materials, derived from Arbitron ratings, among the most-listened-to evening talk hosts in the United States.

Over the years, Brudnoy also appeared as a news commentator and host on local TV stations besides WGBH, including WCVB-TV (ABC), WNAC-TV, and WBZ-TV (CBS). He also appeared nationally on the &quot;CBS Morning News&quot;. He wrote movie reviews for &quot;Boston&quot; magazine and local community newspapers. During the 1970s he wrote articles for the &quot;National Review&quot;, and befriended its editor William F. Buckley Jr. He also wrote for &quot;The Alternative&quot; (later known as &quot;The American Prospect&quot;) in the early 1970s, but quit because of the editor&#x27;s unwillingness to adopt a more liberal position on gay rights. His articles have appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;.

In 1990, his WBZ show was canceled in favor of a less expensive syndicated show hosted by Tom Snyder, but a mass public response, including support from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; and the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, helped lead to his quick return to the station&#x27;s lineup.

Brudnoy&#x27;s popularity escalated him into the Boston media elite, and he was the host of numerous social gatherings at his upscale Back Bay apartment, mixing students, media personalities, and politicians. After his bout with AIDS, Brudnoy began broadcasting from his apartment four nights out of five, welcoming his radio guests into his home and eagerly offering them cocktails. When he returned to the air in early January 1995, after his first battle with HIV/AIDS kept him off the air for ten weeks, Boston Mayor Thomas Menino formally declared January 5 as &quot;David Brudnoy Day&quot; due to his popularity.

In 1997, Brudnoy was awarded the Freedom of Speech Award from the National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts, and was nominated for the major market &quot;Personality of the Year&quot; Marconi Radio Award by the National Association of Broadcasters. In 2001, he celebrated his 25th anniversary on the air. He was inducted to the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame, posthumously, in 2008.

==Politics and sensibilities==
Brudnoy&#x27;s strongly libertarian opinions were expressed with wit and thoughtfulness. He described his own manner as &quot;less ideological and more empathic&quot;, in contrast to more recent figures of conservative talk radio. Many regard him as a unique radio host who was effective at injecting a different perspective into the political dialogue rather than merely cultivating a particular political segment of the population.

His non-partisan, thoughtful way of discussing issues helped him gain a large following despite being based in a staunchly Democratic region. Political figures from both ends of the spectrum praised him for his contributions to the local and national dialogue. Among those who eulogized him when he died were liberals like Senator Edward M. Kennedy who said that David was uniquely fair to his guests. &quot;He couldn&#x27;t care less about your party label, as long as you knew what you were talking about, because he always did&quot;; and conservatives like then-Governor Mitt Romney who said that Brudnoy was &quot;... a friend to hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom he never even saw in person . . . David has left us all a huge inheritance. It&#x27;s an inheritance rich in tolerance, in faith, in the greatness of humanity, in respect for all people...&quot;

In 2000, Brudnoy declared himself a member of the Libertarian Party.

Although his father Harry was a practicing Jew and a member of a Minneapolis synagogue, David Brudnoy was an agnostic who disliked organized religion and was critical of religions that tried to impose their views on others. He did have a bar mitzvah in May 1953, but he was already becoming skeptical of religion and recalled that event as the last time he followed his religious traditions. Years later, he wrote several opinion pieces about his opposition to religious dogmatism. But on the other hand, he also wrote favorably about the good that the church was capable of doing. In one piece, he stated that &quot;...the church itself, for Catholics and non-Catholics alike, is a bulwark of our society. Its severely overburdened clergy are crucial to the development of our youths, to comforting our elders, and to tending our sick.&quot;

But while he was a skeptic about the tenets of organized religion, during his late-2004 bout of serious illness he admitted he had prayed in various ways, including with a Catholic priest who was a friend of his; and he said that he had discussed religion with several of his Jewish friends, including political commentator Jon Keller and conservative newspaper columnist Jeff Jacoby. But he said he did not expect to go to either a heaven or a hell.

==Homosexuality==
Brudnoy came to realize that he was homosexual early in life but successfully hid the fact for many years. While at Texas Southern, he &quot;adopted&quot; a young, recently single mother, Patricia Kennedy, and for many years Brudnoy and Kennedy enjoyed a relationship of mutual convenience, with Brudnoy able to use Kennedy as a cover for his homosexuality, and in return serving as a surrogate father to her two young children. Brudnoy did not reveal his homosexuality to his father and stepmother until his illness in 1994; his father Harry was 88 years old when Brudnoy finally phoned him to give him the news and also discuss the health crisis he was undergoing. David was pleasantly surprised that his parents were supportive. Brudnoy had previously come out to his aunt and uncle after they lost a son (also homosexual) to AIDS.

Brudnoy publicly revealed his homosexuality in 1994, after returning from hospitalization to overcome his long-hidden fight with AIDS. Despite the controversy, his ratings reportedly did not suffer as a result. The controversy was rekindled somewhat after the release of his autobiography, in which he described a history of sexual excesses. Brudnoy did not attempt to mask his sexuality during his adult life, but also made no direct indications of it; it was well known among his colleagues in broadcasting long before he spoke publicly about it. His closest and oldest friend was psychologist Dr. Ward Cromer, with whom he took dozens of trips abroad, and who was incorrectly assumed by many to be Brudnoy&#x27;s sexual partner. Neither of them used that phraseology to describe their relationship, preferring a more accurate title of &quot;best friend&quot;. When Brudnoy died, it was Cromer who became executor of his estate.

==Illness==
Brudnoy was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS in 1988, but kept his treatment a secret until his condition became serious after he contracted pneumonia in 1994. He was absent from public life for some time to fight the disease. Comatose and near death at one point, he eventually returned to reasonable health. It was at that time, in order to conserve his strength, that he broadcast his show from his apartment in the Back Bay section of Boston during part of 1994. Once he was able to return to the air, Brudnoy announced the creation of a fund to fight AIDS. His illness inspired him to publish his autobiography; at the time, it was not a best-seller, but after he died, it became a collector&#x27;s item, since his publisher had originally let it go out of print and now many of his fans wanted copies of it.

In September 2003, he was diagnosed with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare form of skin cancer. After hospitalization and treatment, including another period of being considered near death, the cancer went into apparent remission, and Brudnoy returned to work, with a strained voice, in March 2004. However, in November 2004, doctors discovered that cancer had spread into his lungs and kidneys, forcing him to undergo dialysis in addition to cancer treatment.

Brudnoy checked into Massachusetts General Hospital on December 3, 2004. On December 8, Brudnoy made his last radio broadcast on his show via a deathbed interview with WBZ reporter Gary LaPierre. The following day, Brudnoy ordered his doctors to remove all artificial life support systems, leaving him only with oxygen, morphine, and minimal food. He died hours after having the support removed, on December 9, 2004.

After a few days of on-air remembrance, Brudnoy&#x27;s time slot was assigned to Paul Sullivan, who had previously taken over two hours of Brudnoy&#x27;s shift when Brudnoy&#x27;s illness necessitated reducing his show from five hours to three. Sullivan too would die of cancer, on September 9, 2007.

A public memorial was held for Brudnoy on February 27, 2005, at the Cutler Majestic Theater in Boston, arranged by his WBZ colleagues and Emerson College (which had previously awarded him an honorary doctorate). The memorial service included the participation of the brothers of the Phi Alpha Tau fraternity of Emerson College whom Brudnoy had mentored.

<doc id="1093948" wikidata="Q924567" url="?curid=1093948" title="Curly Howard">
<text>Jerome Lester Horwitz (October 22, 1903 – January 18, 1952), better known by his stage name Curly Howard, was an American comedian and actor. He was a member of the comedy team The Three Stooges, which also featured his elder brothers Moe and Shemp Howard, as well as actor Larry Fine. In early shorts, he was billed as Curley. Curly Howard was generally considered the most popular and recognizable of the Stooges.

He was well known for his high-pitched voice and vocal expressions (&quot;nyuk-nyuk-nyuk!&quot;, &quot;woob-woob-woob!&quot;, &quot;soitenly!&quot; [certainly], &quot;I&#x27;m a victim of soikemstance&quot; [circumstance], and barking like a dog), as well as his physical comedy (e.g., falling on the ground and pivoting on his shoulder as he &quot;walked&quot; in circular motion), improvisations, and athleticism. An untrained actor, Curly borrowed (and significantly exaggerated) the &quot;woo woo&quot; from &quot;nervous&quot; comedian Hugh Herbert. Curly&#x27;s unique version of &quot;woob-woob-woob&quot; was firmly established by the time of the Stooges&#x27; second Columbia film, &quot;Punch Drunks&quot; (1934).

Howard had to leave the Three Stooges act in May 1946 when a massive stroke ended his show business career. He suffered serious health problems and several more strokes until his death in 1952 at age 48.

==Early life==
Curly Howard was born Jerome Lester Horwitz in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, New York, on October 22, 1903. Of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry, he was the youngest of the five sons of Jennie (Gorovitz) and Solomon Horwitz. Because he was the youngest, his brothers called him &quot;Babe&quot; to tease him. The name &quot;Babe&quot; stuck with him all his life. However, when his elder brother Shemp Howard married Gertrude Frank, who was also nicknamed &quot;Babe&quot;, the brothers called him &quot;Curly&quot; to avoid confusion. His full formal Hebrew name was &quot;Yehudah Leib bar Shlomo Natan HaLevi&quot;.

A quiet child, Howard rarely caused problems for his parents (something in which older brothers Moe and Shemp excelled). He was a mediocre student, but excelled as an athlete on the school basketball team. He did not graduate high school; instead, he kept himself busy with odd jobs and constantly following his older brothers, whom he idolized. He was also an accomplished ballroom dancer and singer and regularly turned up at the Triangle Ballroom in Queens, occasionally bumping into actor George Raft.

When Howard was 13, he accidentally shot himself in the left ankle while cleaning a rifle. Moe rushed him to the hospital, saving his life, but the wound resulted in a noticeably thinner left leg and a slight limp. Curly was so afraid of surgery that he never had the limp corrected. While with the Stooges, he developed his famous exaggerated walk to conceal the limp on screen.

Howard was interested in music and comedy, and watched his brothers Shemp and Moe perform as stooges in Ted Healy&#x27;s vaudeville act. He also liked to hang around backstage, although he never participated in any of the routines.

==Career==

===The Three Stooges===
Howard&#x27;s first on-stage appearance was as a comedy musical conductor in 1928 for the Orville Knapp orchestra; Howard would conduct the ensemble with his arms flailing, unaware that he was losing his pants. Moe later recalled that his performances usually overshadowed those of the band. Though he enjoyed the gig, he watched as brothers Moe and Shemp with partner Larry Fine made it big as some of Ted Healy&#x27;s &quot;Stooges&quot;. Vaudeville star Healy had a very popular stage act, in which he would try to tell jokes or sing, only to have his noisy assistants (or &quot;stooges&quot;, in show-business parlance) wander on stage and interrupt or heckle him and cause disturbances from the audience. Meanwhile, Healy and company appeared in their first feature film, Rube Goldberg&#x27;s &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot; (1930).

Shemp Howard, however, soon tired of Healy&#x27;s abrasiveness, bad temper, and alcoholism. In 1932, he was offered a contract at the Vitaphone Studios in Brooklyn. With Shemp gone, Moe suggested that his kid brother Jerry could fill the third-stooge role, and Jerry ran through his Orville Knapp act but Healy was unimpressed: &quot;Is that all he can do? Let his pants fall down? Get me a real comedian, not this amateur. He doesn&#x27;t even look right!&quot; Healy felt that Jerry, with his thick, chestnut hair and elegant waxed mustache, looked too good for a low comedian. Howard left the room and returned minutes later with his head shaven (the mustache remained very briefly). Moe and Larry started improvising with this new character:

:Moe: Hey, Curly!

:Larry: What did you call him?

:Moe: Curly.

:Larry: That&#x27;s all right. I thought you said &quot;girlie!&quot;

That exchange sold the act to Healy, and Jerry Horwitz became Curly Howard. In one of the few interviews Curly Howard gave in his lifetime, he complained about the loss of his hair: &quot;I had to shave it off right down to the skin.&quot; 

In 1934, MGM was building Healy up as a solo comedian in feature films, and Moe saw the writing on the wall. Healy alone was under contract to the studio; his Stooges answered to Healy, who paid each of them only $100 a week. When Healy&#x27;s lucrative MGM contract was up for renewal on March 6, 1934, Moe proposed that Healy and his stooges should split: &quot;Let&#x27;s just break up. No hard feelings, no sneaking around. Just a good, clean split.&quot; Healy agreed, and left to pursue his own career. That same year, with &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; as the act&#x27;s new name, they signed to appear in two-reel comedy short subjects for Columbia Pictures. Their third short, &quot;Men in Black&quot;, was nominated for the &quot;Best Short Subject&quot; Academy Award. It lost to the pioneer Technicolor featurette &quot;La Cucaracha&quot;, but it did establish The Three Stooges as new comedy stars. It also won the Stooges movie-star salaries: Columbia paid each of them $2,500 per short subject (an exceptional sum; Columbia usually paid $500 to $1,000 per short). The Stooges soon became the studio&#x27;s most popular short-subject attraction, with Curly playing an integral part in the trio&#x27;s work.

====Prime years====

Howard&#x27;s childlike mannerisms and natural comedic charm made him a hit with audiences, particularly children. He was known in the act for having an &quot;indestructible&quot; head, which always won out by breaking anything that assaulted it, including saws and hammers (resulting in his characteristic quip, &quot;Oh, look!&quot; when the item is shown damaged while his head is intact). Although Howard had no formal acting training, his comedic skills were exceptional. Often, directors let the camera roll freely and let Howard improvise. Jules White, in particular, left gaps in the Stooge scripts where he could improvise for several minutes. In later years, White commented: &quot;If we wrote a scene and needed a little something extra, I&#x27;d say to Curly, &#x27;Look, we&#x27;ve got a gap to fill this in with a &quot;woo-woo&quot; or some other bit of business&#x27;, and he never disappointed us.&quot;

By the time the Stooges hit their peak in the late 1930s, their films had almost become vehicles for Howard&#x27;s unbridled comic performances. Classics such as &quot;A Plumbing We Will Go&quot; (1940), &quot;We Want Our Mummy&quot; (1938), &quot;An Ache in Every Stake&quot; (1941), &quot;Cactus Makes Perfect&quot; (1942), and their most violent short, &quot;They Stooge to Conga&quot; (1943), display his ability to take inanimate objects (food, tools, pipes, etc.) and turn them into ingenious comic props. Moe Howard later confirmed that when Curly forgot his lines, that merely allowed him to improvise on the spot so that the &quot;take&quot; (or scene) could continue uninterrupted:

Howard also developed a set of Brooklyn-accented reactions and expressions that the other Stooges would imitate long after he had left the act:

* &quot;Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk&quot; – his trademark laugh, accompanied by manic finger-snapping (snapping your fingers before cupping your hand and slapping the other hand down), often used to amuse himself
* &quot;Woob, woob, woob!&quot; – cheering used when he was either happy, scared, dazed, or flirting with a &quot;dame&quot;
* &quot;Hmmm!&quot; – an under-the-breath, high-pitched sound meant to express frustration
* &quot;Nyahh-ahhh-ahhh!&quot; – a scared reaction, which was most often used by the other Stooges after Curly&#x27;s departure
* &quot;La-Dee&quot; or simply &quot;La, la, laaa&quot; – his singing used when he was acting innocently right before taking out an enemy
* &quot;Ruff Ruff&quot; – a dog bark, used to express anger, showing defiance, barking at an attractive dame, and/or giving an enemy a final push before departing the scene
* &quot;Ha-cha-cha!&quot; – a take on Jimmy Durante&#x27;s catchphrase
* &quot;I&#x27;m a victim of soikemstance [circumstance]!&quot; – used to express uncertainty
* &quot;Soitenly!&quot; (&quot;certainly&quot;)
* &quot;I&#x27;ll moider (murder) you!&quot;
* &quot;Huff huff huff!&quot; – sharp, huffing exhales either due to excitement or meant to provoke a foe
* &quot;Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba!&quot; – a sort of nonsense, high-pitched yelling that signified being scared or overly excited, which was used during his later years
* &quot;Indubitably&quot; – an expression used to feign an intelligent response
* Nervous teeth chattering, which made the sound of a small hammer striking a chisel
* &quot;Oh! A WISE guy, eh?&quot; – an annoyed response
* &quot;Oh, look!&quot; – a surprised remark, usually pointing out a saw or hammer which was damaged when came in contact with his hard head. 
* &quot;Say a few syllables!&quot; – to another (injured) Stooge, usually Moe
* Occasionally, the Stooges faced a problem that required deep thought, whereupon Curly would bang his head on a wall several times, then shout, &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot; Moe would ask, &quot;What have you got?&quot; Curly&#x27;s answer: &quot;A terrific headache.&quot;
* Despite his mispronunciations, he had an uncanny ability to instantly spell big words, such as &quot;chrysanthemum&quot;, if asked. The gag was that Curly never did it, when something important was at stake. In one scene, the Stooges were in a situation where this talent might have landed them a job, but Curly had missed his opportunity. Moe&#x27;s reaction would be to growl, &quot;Where were you a minute ago?&quot; and then smack him.

On several occasions, Moe Howard was convinced that rising star Lou Costello (a close friend of Shemp&#x27;s) was stealing material from his brother. Costello was known to acquire prints of the Stooges&#x27; films from Columbia Pictures on occasion, presumably to study him. Inevitably, Curly Howard&#x27;s routines would appear in &quot;Abbott and Costello&quot; feature films, much to Moe&#x27;s chagrin. (It did not help that Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn would not allow the Stooges to make feature-length films like contemporaries Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, and Abbott and Costello.)

Curly was the only &quot;third Stooge&quot; who never made a series of his short films, without Moe or Larry, either before joining the Stooges or after leaving. Shemp and subsequent Stooges Joe Besser and Joe DeRita (referred to during his stint with the Stooges as &quot;Curly Joe DeRita&quot;) each starred in their solo series of theatrical short subjects.

==Illness==

===Decline===
By 1944, Curly Howard&#x27;s energy began to wane. His performances in films such as &quot;Idle Roomers&quot; (1944) and &quot;Booby Dupes&quot; (1945) present a Curly whose voice was deeper and his actions slower. It is believed that Howard suffered the first of several strokes between the production of &quot;Idiots Deluxe&quot; (October 1944) and &quot;If a Body Meets a Body&quot; (March 1945). Following the completion of the feature-length &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Rockies&quot; (December 1944), he was persuaded by Moe Howard to seek medical attention and was admitted to Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California, on January 23, 1945. There, he received diagnoses of severe hypertension, retinal hemorrhage, and obesity, necessitating a period of convalescence. Consequently, only five short films were released in 1945, a notable reduction from the usual six to eight per year.

Despite Moe Howard&#x27;s appeals to Harry Cohn to grant his brother an extended leave to recuperate, Cohn refused to disrupt the production schedule of the profitable Stooges shorts. The team was afforded a hiatus of five months between August 1945 and January 1946, during which they undertook a demanding two-month live performance engagement in New York City, performing daily. During this period, Howard met Marion Buxbaum, whom he married on October 17, 1945, after a two-week courtship.

Upon returning to Los Angeles in late November 1945, Howard&#x27;s health had deteriorated significantly. Despite two months of relative rest, the team&#x27;s 1946 production schedule at Columbia resumed in late January, involving only 24 days of filming between February and early May. Even with an additional eight weeks of respite during this timeframe, Howard&#x27;s physical and mental state continued to decline.

By early 1946, Howard&#x27;s voice had grown increasingly coarse, and he struggled to recall even the most rudimentary dialogue. He exhibited significant weight loss and pronounced facial lines, reflecting the toll of his deteriorating health.

===1946 stroke===

&quot;Half-Wits Holiday&quot;, released in 1947, was Howard&#x27;s final appearance as an official member of The Three Stooges. During filming on May 6, 1946, he suffered a severe stroke while sitting in director Jules White&#x27;s chair, waiting to film the last scene of the day. When called by the assistant director to take the stage, he did not answer. Moe looked for his brother; he found him with his head dropped to his chest. Moe later recalled that his mouth was distorted, and he was unable to speak, only able to cry. Moe immediately alerted White, leading the latter to rework the scene quickly, dividing the action between Moe and Larry while Curly was rushed to the hospital, where Moe joined him after the filming. Howard spent several weeks at the Motion Picture Country House in Woodland Hills before returning home for further recovery.

In January 1946, Shemp had been recruited to substitute for a resting Curly during live performances in New Orleans. After Curly&#x27;s stroke, Shemp agreed to replace him in the Columbia shorts, but only until his younger brother was well enough to rejoin the act. An extant copy of the Stooges&#x27; 1947 Columbia Pictures contract was signed by all four Stooges and stipulated that Shemp&#x27;s joining &quot;in place and stead of Jerry Howard&quot; would be only temporary until Curly recovered sufficiently to return to work full-time. However, Curly&#x27;s health continued to worsen and it became clear that he would not be returning. As a result, Shemp&#x27;s involvement became permanent.

Howard, partially recovered and with his hair regrown, made a brief cameo appearance in January 1947 as a train passenger barking in his sleep in the third film after brother Shemp&#x27;s return, &quot;Hold That Lion!&quot; (1947). It was the only film that featured Larry Fine and all three Howard brothers – Moe, Shemp, and Curly – simultaneously; director White later said he spontaneously staged the bit during Curly&#x27;s impromptu visit to the soundstage:

In June 1948, Howard filmed a second cameo as an angry chef for the short &quot;Malice in the Palace&quot; (1949), but due to his illness, his performance was not deemed good enough, and his scenes were cut. A lobby card for the short shows him with the other Stooges, although he never appeared in the final release.

===Retirement===
Still not fully recovered from his stroke, Howard met Valerie Newman and married her on July 31, 1947. A friend, Irma Leveton, later recalled, &quot;Valerie was the only decent thing that happened to Curly and the only one that really cared about him.&quot; Although his health continued to decline after the marriage, Valerie gave birth to a daughter, Janie, in 1948.

Later that year, Howard suffered a second massive stroke, which left him partially paralyzed. He used a wheelchair by 1950 and was fed boiled rice and apples as part of his diet to reduce his weight (and blood pressure). Valerie admitted him into the Motion Picture &amp; Television Fund&#x27;s Country House and Hospital on August 29, 1950. He was released after several months of treatment and medical tests, although he returned periodically until his death.

In February 1951, Howard entered a nursing home, where he suffered another stroke a month later. In April, he went to live at the North Hollywood Hospital and Sanitarium.

===Final months and death===

In December 1951, the North Hollywood Hospital and Sanitarium supervisor told the Howard family that Curly was becoming a problem to the nursing staff at the facility because of his mental deterioration. They admitted they could no longer care for him and suggested he be placed in a mental hospital. Moe refused and relocated him to the Baldy View Sanitarium in San Gabriel, California.

On January 7, 1952, Moe was contacted on the Columbia set while filming &quot;He Cooked His Goose&quot; to help move Curly for what would be the last time. This proved unsuccessful, and Curly died eleven days later, on January 18, 1952. He lived the shortest life of the Stooges, dying at the age of 48. He was given a Jewish funeral and was buried at the Western Jewish Institute section of Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles, California. His older brothers Shemp and Benjamin would also be interred there in 1955 and 1976 respectively, near parents Jennie and Solomon.

==Personal life==
Offscreen, Howard&#x27;s demeanor stood in stark contrast to his exuberant onscreen persona. A reserved and introspective individual, he largely avoided social interactions unless under the influence of alcohol, a habit that became more pronounced as the pressures of his career intensified. Howard rarely exhibited the boisterous behavior that defined his public image, except in the presence of family, while performing, or during episodes of inebriation. He was, however, widely recognized for his compassion, particularly his tendency to care for stray dogs.

Howard had four marriages and two children:
* Julia Rosenthal (m. August 5, 1930 – divorced January 6, 1931)
* Elaine Ackerman (m. June 7, 1937 – div. July 11, 1940)
** Marilyn Howard Server (daughter, b. 1938)
* Marion Buxbaum (m. October 17, 1945 – div. July 22, 1946)
* Valerie Newman (m. July 31, 1947 – January 18, 1952; his death)
** Janie Howard Hanky (daughter, b. 1948)

Curly Howard&#x27;s first marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce within five months and preceding his rise to fame with the Three Stooges. On June 7, 1937—the twelfth anniversary of his brother Moe&#x27;s marriage to Helen—Howard wed Elaine Ackerman. The union produced one daughter, Marilyn, in 1938, but the couple divorced in June 1940. Following the separation, Howard&#x27;s health began to decline, marked by significant weight gain and the onset of hypertension.

Howard struggled with deep insecurities related to his shaved head, which he believed rendered him unattractive to women. To manage his feelings of inadequacy, he increasingly resorted to excessive drinking and indulgent social behavior. In public, he often wore a hat to project an image of masculinity, lamenting that his bare head made him feel juvenile. Despite his self-esteem issues, Howard remained highly popular with women, though many sought to exploit his generosity and affable nature. 

Moe&#x27;s son-in-law Norman Maurer noted &quot;he was a pushover for women. If a pretty girl went up to him and gave him a spiel, Curly would marry her. Then she would take his money and run off. It was the same when a real estate agent would come up and say &#x27;I have a house for you&#x27;; Curly would sell his current home and buy another one.&quot;

During World War II, the Stooges&#x27; filming schedule was suspended for seven months each year to facilitate personal appearances. During these periods, the trio frequently performed for service members, a demanding schedule that exacerbated Curly&#x27;s deteriorating health. While Howard abstained from alcohol during performances, as Moe strictly prohibited it, his post-work activities often involved excessive indulgence in nightclubs, where he ate, drank, and socialized to cope with professional stress. Howard&#x27;s financial habits were equally extravagant. He spent lavishly on wine, food, women, and real estate, frequently finding himself in precarious financial situations, often nearing bankruptcy. Moe Howard ultimately intervened to manage his brother&#x27;s finances, assisting with budgeting and even preparing Curly&#x27;s income tax returns..

Howard found solace in the companionship of dogs, frequently forming bonds with stray animals during the Stooges&#x27; travels. He often adopted homeless dogs encountered on tour, transporting them from town to town until suitable homes could be secured. When not engaged in performances, Howard maintained several pet dogs at his residence, reflecting his enduring affection for animals.

Moe urged Curly to find himself a wife, hoping it would persuade his brother to finally settle down and allow his health to improve somewhat. After a two-week courtship, he married Marion Buxbaum on October 17, 1945, a union that lasted nine months. The divorce proceeding was bitter, exacerbated by exploitative, sensationalist media coverage, which worsened his already fragile health. The divorce was finalized in July 1946, two months after he suffered his career-ending stroke.

On July 31, 1947, he married Valerie Newman. They had one daughter, Janie (born in 1948), and remained married until his death.

==Legacy==
Curly Howard is considered by many fans and critics alike to be their favorite member of the Three Stooges. In a 1972 interview; Larry Fine recalled, &quot;Personally, I thought Curly was the greatest because he was a natural comedian who had no formal training. Whatever he did, he made up on the spur of the moment. When we lost Curly, we took a hit.&quot; Curly&#x27;s mannerisms, behavior, and personality along with his catchphrases have become a part of American popular culture. Steve Allen called him one of the &quot;few true but seldom recognized comedy geniuses.&quot;

The Ted Okuda and Edward Watz&#x27;s book &quot;The Columbia Comedy Shorts&quot; puts Howard&#x27;s appeal and legacy in critical perspective:
==In popular culture==
* The titular character of the Hanna-Barbera Saturday-morning cartoon series, &quot;Jabberjaw&quot;, was modeled after Curly. The character was voiced by Frank Welker.
*John Candy played Curly in three sketches on the TV series &quot;SCTV&quot; as part of a &quot;Three Dummies&quot; short that aired in the &quot;Muley&#x27;s Roundhouse&quot; sketch. The comedy bits centered around: the techy host of an afternoon kids&#x27; show (Season 1, ep. 23, airing Nov. 21 and 25, 1977); a parody commercial for a mail-order record of Curly &quot;singing&quot; songs such as &quot;Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Theme from The Graduate&quot; (actually &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel), &quot;The Godfather&quot; theme, and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (actually &quot;The Windmills of Your Mind&quot;) (Season 5, ep. 4, airing Nov. 26, 1982); and Curly being picked up by Melvin Dumar and forced to sing in a parody promo for &#x27;Melvin and Howard&#x27; (Season 4, ep. 3, airing May 29, 1981.) 
*The ABC TV sketch comedy series &quot;Fridays&quot; (ABC, 1980-82) featured an occasional skit of &quot;The Numb Boys&quot; – essentially a Stooges routine related to a recent news topic – with John Roarke playing Curly, Bruce Mahler as Moe and Larry David as Larry.
*Curly&#x27;s legend far outlived him when the otherwise-obscure country-pop Jump &#x27;n the Saddle Band scored one of the biggest novelty hits of the 1980s with their 1983 single, &quot;The Curly Shuffle&quot;. The video featured some of Curly&#x27;s best scenes. One band member claimed they watched hundreds of hours&#x27; worth of Three Stooges films to find the right clips.
*In the &quot;JAG&quot; episode &quot;Cowboys and Cossacks&quot;, the Russian sailors mimic Curly when the Three Stooges are mentioned.
*In 2000, longtime Stooges fan Mel Gibson produced a television film for ABC about the lives and careers of the Stooges. In an interview promoting the film, he said Curly was his favorite of the Stooges. In the film; Curly was played by Michael Chiklis.
*In the 2012 Farrelly brothers&#x27; film &quot;The Three Stooges&quot;, Will Sasso portrays Curly Howard. Robert Capron portrays young Curly.
*In the children&#x27;s novel series &quot;Captain Underpants&quot; and its film adaptation, the elementary school that the main characters attend is named Jerome Horwitz Elementary School, in Howard&#x27;s honor.
*One of Curly&#x27;s grandsons, Bradley Server, performs at Stooge tribute shows under the moniker &quot;Curly G&quot;, and has a YouTube channel named &quot;Curly&#x27;s Grandson&quot;.

<text>Barnett Jerome &quot;Barney&quot; Danson (February 8, 1921 – October 17, 2011) was a Canadian politician and Cabinet minister.

==Family==

Barnett Jerome &quot;Barney&quot; Danson was born to a Jewish family in Toronto&#x27;s Parkdale neighbourhood. He joined The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada in 1939 as the Second World War broke out. He rose to the rank of Lieutenant and served until he was severely wounded, losing an eye, in the Battle of Normandy. His ailment created an interest in the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) and its library for the blind and visually impaired, which he maintained until his death.

He returned to Canada and joined his family&#x27;s insurance business before entering the plastics industry with his own company, the Danson Corporation. He also served as president of the Society of the Plastics Industry of Canada.

In 2002, his autobiography, &quot;Not Bad for a Sergeant: The Memoirs of Barney Danson&quot;, was published.

His son, Tim Danson, is a Toronto lawyer known as a victim&#x27;s rights advocate and for having represented the families of Paul Bernardo&#x27;s victims.

==Politics==

Danson was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1968 general election as the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto-area riding of York North. Danson was unsuccessful during his first attempt at politics as an Ontario Liberal Party
candidate in the 1967 provincial election in the riding of York Mills.

In 1970, he became Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and was appointed to the Cabinet in 1974 as Minister of State for urban affairs. In 1976, he was promoted to Minister of National Defence. While Minister of National Defence, he was appointed the Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of The Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles of Canada, his regiment.

He served in that position until the defeat of the Liberal government in the 1979 general election, in which he lost his seat. Danson received an honorary degree (1993) from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, of which he was a former chancellor.

As a Member of the Privy Council Danson was styled &quot;The Honourable&quot;.

==Service==
Danson is the co-founder along with Jacques Hébert of Katimavik, the national youth volunteer programme. Danson served as Canada&#x27;s Consul General in Boston from 1984 to 1986.

He served on corporate and not-for-profit boards of directors such as the Canadian Executive Services Organization (CESO), Canadian Council of Christians and Jews, the Atlantic Council, the Empire Club of Canada, the Ballet Opera House Corporation, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada, Algoma Central Corporation, General steelwares, the Royal Conservatory of Music, and Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business.

During his last years, Danson was chairman of the advisory committee of the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa and produced &quot;No Price Too High&quot;, a six-part series broadcast on CBC Television on Canada&#x27;s role in World War II.

A theatre in the Canadian War Museum is named for him in honour of his service and to his four closest war-time friends killed in action; Sgt Fred B. Harris-Queen&#x27;s, Lt Gerald Rayner, Lt Earl R. Stoll, and Lt Harlan David Keely.

==Awards==
Danson was named an Officer of France&#x27;s National Order of Merit (1994), and the Churchill Society&#x27;s Award for &quot;Excellence in the Cause of Parliamentary Democracy&quot; (1995). In 1996, Danson was named an Officer of the Order of Canada and promoted to Companion in 2008.

In 2000, he was awarded the Vimy Award. In 2006, Danson was made an honorary Doctor of Laws by York University of Toronto.

He was sworn in as a Member of the Privy Council on August 8, 1974, which gave him the title &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life.

On March 28, 2007, he was made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honour.

<doc id="1093963" wikidata="Q3282930" url="?curid=1093963" title="Polka Party!">
<text>Polka Party! is the fourth studio album by the American parody musician &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, released on October 21, 1986. The album was produced by former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer. Recorded between April and September 1986, the album was Yankovic&#x27;s follow-up to his successful 1985 release, &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Living With a Hernia&quot;, failed to chart.

The music on &quot;Polka Party!&quot; is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s, featuring direct parodies of James Brown, Mick Jagger, El DeBarge and Robert Palmer. The album also features many &quot;style parodies&quot;, or musical imitations that come close to, but do not copy, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of specific artists like Talking Heads, as well as imitations of various musical genres like country music.

Peaking at No. 177 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, &quot;Polka Party!&quot; was met with mixed-to-negative reviews and was considered a commercial and critical failure. Despite this, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1988. &quot;Polka Party!&quot; is one of Yankovic&#x27;s few studio albums not to be certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

==Production==
===Recording===
Yankovic entered the recording studio in April 1986 to begin the sessions to his follow-up to 1985&#x27;s &quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot;. To produce the album, Yankovic brought in former McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer, who had also produced Yankovic&#x27;s previous albums. Backing Yankovic were Jon &quot;Bermuda&quot; Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. The album was recorded in roughly three sessions. The first session took place between April 22 and 23, and yielded four originals: &quot;Don&#x27;t Wear Those Shoes&quot;, &quot;One of Those Days&quot;, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, and &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot;. The second session, which spanned August 4–5, produced three parodies: &quot;Living with a Hernia&quot;, &quot;Addicted to Spuds&quot;, and &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;. The final session, which lasted from August 29 to September 1, produced the parody &quot;Toothless People&quot;, an original song named &quot;Good Enough for Now&quot;, and the album&#x27;s titular polka medley. Thematically, Yankovic described the record as &quot;not a whole lot different than&quot; the other albums he had recorded, calling the process &quot;even a bit formulaic&quot;.

===Originals===
On April 22, 1986, Yankovic began recording three new original songs for his next album: &quot;Don&#x27;t Wear Those Shoes&quot;, &quot;One of Those Days&quot;, and &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. Although &quot;Don&#x27;t Wear Those Shoes&quot; is an original composition, Yankovic admitted that the intro was inspired by the style of The Kinks. Lyrically, the song is a plea by the singer to his wife not to not wear certain shoes which he cannot stand. &quot;One of Those Days&quot; is a song detailing horrible things as if they were everyday annoyances. Each horrible thing escalates up to global annihilation while more mundane annoyances pop up at different times.


&quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; is a style parody of Talking Heads. Described as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek look at office life&quot;, the song was inspired by Yankovic&#x27;s past experience of working in the mailroom and traffic department at the Westwood One radio station. He noted, &quot;At first I thought [the job] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me.&quot; The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song &quot;Once In a Lifetime&quot;: &quot;Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself, this is not my beautiful chair!&quot; This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: &quot;You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this is not my beautiful wife&quot;.

On April 23, Yankovic recorded &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot;. The song, &quot;a cheery little tune about death, destruction and the end of the world&quot; was the result of Scotti Brothers Records&#x27; insistence that Yankovic release a Christmas record. After Yankovic presented the song to his label, they relented, because it was &quot;a little different from what they were expecting.&quot; After the song&#x27;s release, some radio stations banned the record, a move that Yankovic attributes to &quot;most people [not wanting] to hear about nuclear annihilation during the holiday season.&quot; Following the September 11 attacks, when the general term &quot;ground zero&quot; was co-opted as a proper name for the World Trade Center site where two of those attacks took place, the disturbing lyrics caused this song to be banned largely from radio. Yankovic wanted the song to receive a video, but due to budget reasons, his label did not agree. Yankovic, however, directed one himself which was mostly made up of stock footage, with a live action finale that was filmed in a run-down part of the Bronx, New York that &quot;looked like a bomb had fallen on it.&quot;

The final original that was recorded was &quot;Good Enough for Now&quot;, a country music pastiche about how the singer&#x27;s lover, while not the best, will do for now.

===Parodies and polka===

On August 4, Yankovic began recording parodies starting with &quot;Living with a Hernia&quot;. The song, a spoof of &quot;Living in America&quot; by James Brown—which was also the theme to the 1985 film &quot;Rocky IV&quot;—is about hernias. When it came time to pick a song to parody as the lead single for &quot;Polka Party!&quot; Scotti Brothers Records &quot;had some very strong ideas&quot; and wished to have Yankovic parody a musician who was signed on the same label. After &quot;Living in America&quot; became a hit, the record label insisted that Yankovic parody the song, to which Yankovic obliged. In order to accurately write the song, Yankovic researched the various types of hernias. Yankovic noted that &quot;it was a real thrill to do James Brown. I&#x27;m a total non-dancer, never went to any dances in high school, but if I analytically dissect a dance routine I can figure it out.&quot; A choreographer named Chester Whitmore was hired to accurately create the dance scenes featured in the video, which was shot on the concert set actually used in the movie &quot;Rocky IV&quot;. The second parody recorded was &quot;Addicted to Spuds&quot;, a pastiche of &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; by Robert Palmer, about a man&#x27;s obsession for potatoes and potato-based dishes. A music video for the song was never made because there was a strict budget for videos for the album, and Yankovic felt that the video would be &quot;one joke&quot; and not really worth its own video. A parody of Palmer&#x27;s video, however, was later inserted into Al&#x27;s &quot;UHF&quot; video.

On August 5, Yankovic recorded &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;, a parody of &quot;Who&#x27;s Johnny&quot; by El DeBarge. The song, a loving ode to &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; announcer Ed McMahon, features John Roarke of the television series &quot;Fridays&quot; fame doing an impression of McMahon&#x27;s voice. According to Yankovic, Peter Wolf, the man who wrote &quot;Who&#x27;s Johnny&quot;, enjoyed the parody idea so much that he personally brought into the studio the floppy disc that contained the song&#x27;s programmed synthesizer parts. The final parody recorded for the album was &quot;Toothless People&quot;, a play on Mick Jagger&#x27;s &quot;Ruthless People&quot;, which was recorded on August 29, 1986. The song, about elderly people who are missing their teeth, was written after Yankovic heard it would be the theme to the 1986 film &quot;Ruthless People&quot;. Assuming the song would be a hit, Yankovic requested and received permission from Jagger to record a parody version. Jagger&#x27;s song, however, was never a hit, but because Jagger had &quot;approved&quot; the parody, he decided that failing to produce it would be an &quot;insult&quot; to the artist.

The album&#x27;s polka medley, the titular &quot;Polka Party!&quot;, was recorded on the same day as &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;. This was Yankovic&#x27;s third polka medley, and his only medley to bear the same name as an album. Like his other medleys, the song is a conglomeration of then-popular songs in music.

==Reception==
===Promotion===
To promote the album&#x27;s release, Scotti Brothers Records purchased full-page ads in &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine that advertised the release as Yankovic&#x27;s &quot;biggest bash yet&quot;. Unlike previous albums, Yankovic did not undertake a tour to promote &quot;Polka Party!&quot; Instead, he opened for the American rock band the Monkees; Yankovic later joked that the Monkees merely &quot;closed&quot; for him. Yankovic explained that while it &quot;was a fun tour&quot; and that the crowds were very enthusiastic, the tension between the Monkees was obvious; on his website, he wrote that while the band members &quot;are all terrific people individually&quot;, they &quot;didn&#x27;t seem to get along all that great when they weren&#x27;t on stage.&quot;

===Critical response===
&quot;Polka Party!&quot; received mixed to negative reviews from critics. AllMusic reviewer Eugene Chadbourne gave the album three stars and wrote that &quot;just about anyone could feel let down by this album.&quot; Chadbourne was largely critical of the parody choices, noting that many of the original versions would be forgotten in &quot;fifteen years&quot;. Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault gave &quot;Polka Party!&quot; an F and described it as an album that &quot;seemed like it could well have been the &#x27;last call&#x27; for Yankovic.&quot; Thelen heavily criticized the record, writing that both the parodies and originals were not good and that &quot;Yankovic [was] going through the motions&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; awarded the album three-and-a-half stars, tying it with the 1992 album &quot;Off the Deep End&quot; and the 1999 release &quot;Running with Scissors&quot; as Yankovic&#x27;s best-rated album. Although it was not a critical success, the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Recording in 1987, but lost to Bill Cosby&#x27;s &quot;Those of You with or Without Children, You&#x27;ll Understand&quot;.

Despite the album&#x27;s lackluster reception, many of the songs on the album, such as &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, &quot;Addicted to Spuds&quot;, and &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot;, went on to become fan favorites and live staples. Two of the album&#x27;s tracks, &quot;Living with a Hernia&quot; and &quot;Addicted to Spuds&quot;, appeared on Yankovic&#x27;s first greatest hits album (1988), &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot; appeared on the second volume (1994). In addition, the 1994 box set &quot;Permanent Record: Al in the Box&quot; contained five of the album&#x27;s songs: &quot;Addicted to Spuds&quot;, &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny&quot;, &quot;Living with a Hernia&quot;, and &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot;. Only &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;, however, appeared on Yankovic&#x27;s 2009 &quot;Essential&quot; collection, although the 3.0 version contained &quot;Living with a Hernia&quot;.

===Commercial performance===
&quot;Polka Party!&quot; was released October 21, 1986. After it was released, the album peaked at No. 177 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Compared to Yankovic&#x27;s previous albums—&quot;Dare to Be Stupid&quot; peaked at No. 50 and &quot;In 3-D&quot; peaked at No. 17—&quot;Polka Party!&quot; was considered a commercial disappointment for the comedian. The album was the lowest-charting studio album released by Yankovic and is one of his few studio albums not to be certified either Gold or Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The others include the soundtrack to his film &quot;UHF&quot; (1989) and &quot;Poodle Hat&quot; (2003).

Yankovic was dismayed by the album&#x27;s lackluster reception. He noted that he &quot;thought it was the end of [his] career&quot;. Yankovic explained that &quot;I figured I&#x27;d peaked with &#x27;Eat It&#x27; and &#x27;Like a Surgeon&#x27; and now people were slowly forgetting about me and I was well on my way to obscurity.&quot; However, Yankovic&#x27;s next album, &quot;Even Worse&quot;, would resurrect his career and become his best-selling album at the time; the experience led Yankovic to realize that &quot;careers have peaks and valleys, and whenever I go through the rough times, another peak might be right around the corner.&quot;

<text>WUVG-DT (channel 34) is a television station licensed to Athens, Georgia, United States, broadcasting the Spanish-language Univision and UniMás networks to the Atlanta area. Owned and operated by TelevisaUnivision, the station maintains studios on Peachtree Road NE in the Buckhead section of Atlanta and a primary transmitter in North Druid Hills.

WUVG-DT was established as WNGM-TV, a station serving the Athens area, in 1989. Its focus broadened to Atlanta in the 1990s as the station was sold several times, airing home shopping, music videos, and then an independent format under the ownership of USA Broadcasting. It switched to Univision in January 2002, making it the first Spanish-language station in the market.

==History==
===WNGM-TV===
The station went on air on April 18, 1989, as WNGM-TV, with the call sign standing for &quot;North Georgia Mountains&quot;. Initially the station ran a general entertainment format with cartoons, classic and recent sitcoms, blocks of country music programming, old movies and syndicated first-run shows; it also aired a local newscast and magazine program focusing on north Georgia.

WNGM-TV was owned by a company including the final two applicants for the channel: Georgia Mountain Corporation and Sunbelt Television, Inc., which merged their bids in 1985 and won the construction permit. Its transmitter was located away from Atlanta, reaching Athens with a grade A signal while sending a very weak signal into eastern metro Atlanta. As a result, many syndicators sold the rights for shows that were already on the Atlanta stations to WNGM. The station provided an alternative to viewers in areas which had moderate VHF reception and poor UHF reception from Atlanta; Clarke County had a cable penetration rate of 83 percent, 30 points above the national average.

NGM Television Partners, the licensee, sold the station for $10 million in 1996 to Whitehead Media, which the next year formalized a time brokerage agreement under which Paxson Communications Corporation began operating channel 34. However, Paxson opted the next year to divest itself of extra stations in markets where it controlled more than one, such as Atlanta, where it owned WPXA-TV. The $73.5 million sale by Paxson of the operating rights and by Whitehead of the licenses for WNGM-TV and WOAC in Canton, Ohio, to Global Broadcasting Systems, Inc., was terminated a month later when the buyer failed to post an escrow deposit.

From 1996 until September 1, 1997, WNGM-TV aired Paxson&#x27;s Infomall TV infomercial network, then switching to separate but similar home shopping programming, which was an issue at play in a cable carriage dispute with MediaOne over whether it had to be placed on a series of major Atlanta-area cable systems.

===&quot;Hotlanta 34&quot;===
In 1998, USA Broadcasting acquired WNGM for $50 million. It was part of a larger deal between Paxson and USA that allowed Paxson-owned stations in New Orleans and Memphis to make early exits from affiliation contracts with the Home Shopping Network, gave Paxson a station serving Portland, Oregon, and put USA Broadcasting in every top 10 market but Detroit. After the USA acquisition, the home shopping programming was dropped and replaced with music videos from The Box—which led the FCC to greenlight the station&#x27;s push for must-carry in the Atlanta area that August.

In November 1999, WNGM was the third of four USAB stations after Miami&#x27;s WAMI-TV to convert to USAB&#x27;s new &quot;CityVision&quot; general entertainment format and became &quot;Hotlanta 34&quot; under new WHOT-TV call letters. The centerpiece of the plan was a three-year contract for the rights to telecast Atlanta Hawks basketball. The move was made after WATL (channel 36) opted not to renew its deal because of the expanding program offerings of The WB. However, after the format failed to take off where it was introduced and the company registered operating losses of $62 million in 2000, Diller opted to sell the stations to Univision in 2001.

===Univision Georgia===
While some of the stations were used to start Telefutura, a second network, the purchase gave Univision its first ever broadcast outlet in Atlanta, where the Latino population had grown by 362 percent during the 1990s. Under new WUVG call letters, channel 34 changed to Spanish-language programming on January 14, 2002. While local news was not immediately added, WUVG began producing a public affairs program in Spanish, (&quot;Our Georgia&quot;), the first such program on Atlanta television since 1997.

==News operation==
WUVG launched its news department in April 2011, with two daily half-hour evening newscasts at 6 and 11 p.m.—branded as (&quot;News 34 Atlanta&quot;)—anchored by Amanda Ramirez (now at WLII-DT) and Gianncarlo Cifuentes. The station also maintained a partnership with WGCL-TV (now WANF) for news coverage.

The station&#x27;s other local program is a weekend newsmagazine, .

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

===Translator===
WUVG-DT maintains a digital replacement translator, which enhances channel 34&#x27;s coverage in the city of license, Athens.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WUVG shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 34, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48, using virtual channel 34; it was later repacked to channel 18.

<doc id="1093971" wikidata="Q6297079" url="?curid=1093971" title="Joy Cowley">
<text>Cassia Joy Cowley (; born 7 August 1936) is a New Zealand author best known for her children&#x27;s fiction, including the popular series of books Mrs. Wishy-Washy.

==Writing career==
Cowley started out writing novels for adults, and her first book, &quot;Nest in a Falling Tree&quot; (1967), was adapted for the screen by Roald Dahl. It became the 1971 film &quot;The Night Digger&quot;. Following its success in the United States, Cowley wrote several other novels, including &quot;Man of Straw&quot; (1972), &quot;Of Men and Angels&quot; (1972), &quot;The Mandrake Root&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Growing Season&quot; (1979). Typical themes of these works were marital infidelity, mental illness, and death, as experienced within families. Cowley has also published several collections of short stories, including &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; (with Mona Williams, 1984) and &quot;Heart Attack and Other Stories&quot; (1985). Today she is best known for children&#x27;s books, such as &quot;The Silent One&quot; (1981), which was made into a 1985 film. Others include &quot;Bow Down Shadrach&quot; (1991) and its sequel, &quot;Gladly, Here I Come&quot; (1994).

Cowley has written forty-one picture books, such as &quot;The Duck in the Gun&quot; (1969), &quot;The Terrible Taniwha of Timberditch&quot; (1982), &quot;Salmagundi&quot; (1985), and &quot;The Cheese Trap&quot; (1995). &quot;The Duck in the Gun&quot; and &quot;Salmagundi&quot; are explicitly anti-war books. She has been actively involved in teaching early reading skills and helping those with reading difficulties, in which capacity she has written approximately 500 basal readers (termed &quot;reading books&quot; in New Zealand).

==Honours and awards==
In 1990, Cowley was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal, and in the 1992 New Year Honours she was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, for services to children&#x27;s literature. The following year she was granted an Honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) from Massey University, and was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal.

In 1993, Cowley became the third recipient of the Margaret Mahy Award, whose winners present and publish a lecture concerning children&#x27;s literature or literacy. Cowley&#x27;s lecture was titled &quot;Influences &quot;. The award is presented by the Storylines Childrens Literature Charitable Trust, who established the Joy Cowley Award in 2002, in recognition of the &quot;exceptional contribution Joy Cowley makes to both children&#x27;s literature and literacy in New Zealand and internationally&quot;. In 2004, she became a patron of the Storylines Childrens Literature Foundation , and she is one of Storylines&#x27; trustees. At least one of her books has been on the Storylines Notable Books List every year since it was established in 2000, other than 2009 and 2011 (in 2012 she was given a &quot;special mention&quot;).

In 2002, she was awarded the Roberta Long Medal, presented by the University of Alabama at Birmingham for culturally diverse children&#x27;s literature. In 2004, she was awarded the A. W. Reed Award for Contribution to New Zealand Literature, and in 2010, she won the Prime Minister&#x27;s Award for Literary Achievement in the Fiction category.

Cowley has won the overall Book of the Year award three times at the various incarnations of the New Zealand Post Children&#x27;s Book Awards: first for &quot;The Silent One&quot; in 1982; then for &quot;Hunter&quot; in 2006; and finally for &quot;Snake and Lizard&quot; in 2008. The latter two books were entered into the Junior Fiction category, in which she also won the category award for her books &quot;Ticket to the Sky Dance&quot; in 1998, &quot;Starbright and the Dream Eater&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Shadrach Girl&quot; in 2001. She won the Children&#x27;s Choice award in this category for &quot;Friends: Snake and Lizard&quot; in 2010.

She won the now defunct Fiction category in 1992 for &quot;Bow Down Shadrach&quot;, and the Picture Book category in 2002 for &quot;Brodie&quot;. An additional five of her books have been short-listed as finalists in the Picture Book category at the awards, and an additional three in the Junior Fiction category.

Cowley&#x27;s book &quot;The Video Shop Sparrow&quot; was included in the 2000 White Ravens List, administered by the International Youth Library, and five of her books have been finalists for the Esther Glen Award from 1995 to 2010. She won Best Script Television Drama at the 1994 TV Guide Television Awards for &quot;Mother Tongue&quot;, a 52-minute film shot in 1992, and set in 1953, about an 18-year-old couple who fall in love – although the woman (played by Sarah Smuts-Kennedy) is Catholic, and the man (played by Craig Parker) is Jewish.

In the 2005 Queen’s Birthday Honours, Cowley was appointed a Distinguished Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (DCNZM), for services to children&#x27;s literature. In 2009, when the New Zealand government restored titular honours, Cowley declined redesignation as a dame.

Cowley was made a Member of the Order of New Zealand (ONZ), for services to New Zealand, in the 2018 New Year Honours. In 2020, she received an Arts Foundation of New Zealand Icon Award, limited to 20 living people.

==Personal life==
Cowley has been married three times, first at twenty years old to dairy farmer Ted Cowley, with whom she had four children. After their marriage ended in 1967, Cowley married Malcolm Mason, a Wellington writer and accountant who died in 1985.

In 1989, Cowley married Terry Coles, a former Catholic priest. She lived with him, and an assortment of animals, for many years in the Marlborough Sounds, but in 2004 they moved to a wharf apartment in Wellington so Coles could be nearer medical services. As Coles&#x27; health deteriorated, Wellington&#x27;s stairs and traffic became too much for him, and the couple moved again to Featherston, where Cowley now lives. She has 13 grandchildren and still writes full-time. Coles died in September 2022.

<doc id="1093985" wikidata="Q1706908" url="?curid=1093985" title="Sliver (song)">
<text>&quot;Sliver&quot; is a song by the American rock band Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. It was first released as a non-album single by the band&#x27;s then record label, Sub Pop, in the United States in September 1990, and by Tupelo in Britain in January 1991. The same recording was re-released on the compilation album &quot;Incesticide&quot; by DGC in December 1992, and a new music video, directed by Kevin Kerslake, was released in May 1993. 

Described as featuring some of Cobain&#x27;s most straightforward lyrics, &quot;Sliver&quot; is a semi-autobiographical, first-person account of a child who is forced to spend a day at his grandparents&#x27; house, insists on being taken home, falls asleep, and finally wakes up in his &quot;mother&#x27;s arms.&quot; It was recorded shortly before the addition of the band&#x27;s final drummer, Dave Grohl, and features drums by Dan Peters, of the Seattle rock band, Mudhoney.

Cobain saw the song as an important indicator of Nirvana&#x27;s musical direction, as the band moved away from the heavier grunge sound of their 1989 debut album, &quot;Bleach&quot;, towards to more commercial music of their 1991 major label debut, &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

==Early history==

&quot;Sliver&quot; was written in 1990. According to the 1993 biography &quot;Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana&quot; by Michael Azerrad, the song was written during a rehearsal with Dan Peters, who briefly played the drums with Nirvana while the future of his band, Mudhoney, was uncertain. According to Azerrad, the lyrics to &quot;Sliver&quot; were written shortly before they were recorded, although an acoustic demo of the song, first released on Nirvana box set &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; in November 2004, suggests that Cobain had written some of the lyrics before entering the studio to record the vocals. &quot;I decided I wanted to write the most ridiculous pop song I had ever written,&quot; Cobain explained to Azerrad, in order &quot;to prepare people for the next album,&quot; which became their 1991 release, &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

==&quot;Sliver&quot; single==

The studio version of &quot;Sliver&quot; was recorded by Jack Endino at Reciprocal Recording in Seattle, Washington. Most of the instruments were recorded on July 11, 1990, during a studio break by the Sub Pop band, TAD &quot;We called Tad up and asked if we could come over and record the song,&quot; Cobain recalled in a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; interview with journalist Push in December 1990. &quot;We used their instruments while they sat around eating. But that&#x27;s nothing new...the key to a successful album is to get the fuck out of the studio before you&#x27;re sick of the songs.&quot; With Peters on drums, the band recorded the song&#x27;s music in less than an hour. Two weeks later, on July 24, Cobain returned to the studio and recorded his vocals as well as an additional guitar with Endino, who then mixed the track.

Cobain was pleased with the recording, telling Azerrad, &quot;It has a massive naïveté to it. It was done so fast and raw and perfect that I don&#x27;t think we could capture that again if we decided to rerecord it. It&#x27;s just one of those recordings that happened and you can&#x27;t try to reproduce it.

Unlike most Nirvana songs, &quot;Sliver&quot; was recorded in the studio before it had ever been played live. Its live debut was on September 22, 1990, at the Motor Sports International Garage in Seattle, the only show that Peters ever played with the band. &quot;Sliver&quot; also represents Peters&#x27; only appearance on a Nirvana studio recording. Cobain was happy with the time Peters spent with Nirvana, telling Azerrad, &quot;The chemistry was definitely there...We could have ended up writing some really good songs together.&quot; As Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic explained, however, &quot;If Dan were to have joined our band it would&#x27;ve been certain that Mudhoney was finished, and we didn&#x27;t want to be responsible for that.&quot;

==Post-&quot;Sliver&quot; single==

In December 1992, a live version of &quot;Sliver,&quot; recorded at Del Mar Fairgrounds in Del Mar, California, on December 28, 1991, was released as a B-side on the fourth and final &quot;Nevermind&quot; single, &quot;In Bloom.&quot;

The same month, the studio version of &quot;Sliver&quot; appeared on &quot;Incesticide&quot;, a rarities compilation released in the wake of the surprising success of the band&#x27;s major label debut, &quot;Nevermind&quot;. A music video was filmed for the song in March 1993 and first aired in May 1993. It was the only music video released from the album.

The final live performance of &quot;Sliver&quot; was at Nirvana&#x27;s last concert, at Terminal Eins in Munich, Germany, on March 1, 1994.

==Composition and lyrics==
===Music===

In an October 1990 interview in London, England, Cobain told Rupert Brankin-Frisby of &quot;Vice Lizard&quot; that the song &quot;was inspired by &#x27;cutie&#x27; bands like the Vaselines, Beat Happening and Half Japanese.&quot; In a 1992 advertisement for &quot;Incesticide&quot;, he described it as &quot;an experiment in dynamics and simplicity inspired by Half Japanese, ELP, and ELO.&quot;

===Lyrics===

According to Azerrad, &quot;Sliver&quot; contained the most literal lyrics that Cobain ever wrote, telling a story of a boy who was left with his grandparents for the day by his parents, had a difficult time eating dinner and playing, and insisted on being taken home until finally falling asleep after eating ice-cream and watching television, and later waking up in his mother&#x27;s arms. Despite the straightforward lyrics, the song was given an intentionally confusing title, with Cobain explaining, &quot;I had a feeling if I called it &#x27;Sliver,&#x27; most people would call it &#x27;Silver.&#x27;&quot;

==Release==

The &quot;Sliver&quot; single was first released on 7-inch vinyl in the US in 1990 by Sub Pop. The initial run of 3,000 copies was pressed on black, marbled blue, or clear pink vinyl. It was released on CD single, 7-inch vinyl and 12-inch vinyl in the UK in 1991 on the Tupelo record label, and peaked at number 90 on the UK Singles Chart. Noted music photographer Charles Peterson provided black and white photography. The single charted at number 23 in Ireland in 1992, due to the success of the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot;, released in September 1991.

Following its re-release on &quot;Incesticide&quot; in December 1992, the song was sent to radio and reached number 19 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart in early 1993. The &quot;Sliver&quot; single re-charted at number 77 on the UK Singles Chart in December 1992, due to the release of &quot;Incesticide&quot;.

In August 2024, the single entered the UK Official Vinyl Singles at number 39, marking the band&#x27;s first appearance on the chart.

The &quot;Incesticide&quot; and CD single versions omitted a phone conversation between a hungover Novoselic and Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman that appears at the end of the song in the vinyl single. The exchange, which ended with a confused-sounding Novoselic advising Poneman to call back later that day, was accidentally recorded on Novoselic&#x27;s answering machine.

The single was re-released on silver 7-inch vinyl on 26 March 2021 by Jackpot Records and it is limited to 1,000 copies.

===Critical reception===

Reviewing the single in a 1990 issue of &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Everett True wrote, &quot;Sure, the vocals are lazily throat splitting, the guitars belligerently grungy, the bass up and out of place . . . but check the melodies, damn fools, check the melodies. The only reason this isn&#x27;t &#x27;Single Of The Week&#x27; is because three even mightier singles were released this week.&quot;

===Legacy===

In a July 2018 retrospective review of &quot;Incesticide&quot;, Jenny Pelly of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;Sliver&quot; was &quot;a hilarious caricature&quot; of a pop song that featured &quot;the exaggerated naivete and cool simplicity of Olympia bands that Cobain loved, like Beat Happening and the Go Team.

In 2011, &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song at number nine on their list of the 10 best Nirvana songs. In 2015, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number three on their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs. In 2020, it was ranked at number one on &quot;Kerrang!&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The 20 Greatest Nirvana Songs - Ranked&quot; list, with Sam Law calling it &quot;a finely-balanced moment in time, powered by the frontman’s tortured intelligence but not yet corrupted by the anguish and addiction that would eventually spell his demise.&quot; In 2023, Stephen Thomas Erlewine ranked it seventh in &quot;the A.V. Club&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Essential Nirvana: Their 30 greatest songs, ranked&quot; list.

Rivers Cuomo, of the American alternative rock band Weezer, cited &quot;Sliver&quot; as the song that made the biggest impact on his life in his early 20s, and shared his memory of hearing it for the first time in a 2015 &quot;Pitchfork&quot; interview: &quot;It was just one of those things where, by the time it got through the first chorus, I was just running around the store ... [It] had the simplicity of the Velvet Underground in the structure and the chords ... [and] the melody and the major chord progression of the pop music I love, like ABBA, but also this sense of destructiveness ... and it came out in this new hybrid style.&quot;

In 2022, Paris Jackson paid homage to the music video for &quot;Sliver&quot; with the music video for her song &quot;Lighthouse&quot; which was filmed in a similar setting and also included a picture of Kurt Cobain.

==Music video==

The music video for &quot;Sliver&quot; was not filmed until March 1993. This meant that when the song featured on &quot;ITV&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The Chart Show&quot; indie chart in February 1991 in the UK that only the single&#x27;s cover art was shown with the audio of the song playing over it.

The song&#x27;s music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had also directed three previous videos for the band, &quot;Come As You Are,&quot; &quot;Lithium&quot; and &quot;In Bloom.&quot; The video starts with Cobain&#x27;s infant daughter Frances Bean Cobain dancing to the song&#x27;s bassline, held by Kurt from behind while his arms were sticking out of two holes he cut through a piece of cardboard, then switches to the band performing the song in Cobain&#x27;s garage. The video shows Dave Grohl on drums, although he does not appear on the track. Cobain does not play the guitar in the video, only singing into a microphone while wearing a red and black striped mohair sweater his wife, Courtney Love, had bought for him from a fan after a Nirvana show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Cobain&#x27;s garage itself had been decorated with toys, posters and artifacts he had collected over several years, and kept in storage since before &quot;Nevermind&quot; was recorded in May 1991. Among the items featured in the video is a Chim-Chim toy which had been given to Cobain by the Japanese rock band Shonen Knife as a present.

The video was accepted by MTV in May, but frames featuring the logos of the magazines &quot;Maximumrockandroll&quot; and &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot; had to be removed due to the network&#x27;s rules on product placement. It was also played on MTV Europe. It was also played on &quot;The Afternoon Show&quot; in Australia.

<text>Stanley Haidasz, (March 4, 1923 – August 6, 2009) was a Canadian politician and physician.

==Life and career==
Haidasz was born to Polish parents who immigrated to Canada in 1910 from Stanislawów. He studied medicine. After graduating from the University of Toronto in 1951, he did post-graduate work in cardiology at the University of Chicago.

Haidasz entered politics when he ran in the 1957 election, and became the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for the Toronto riding of Trinity. He was defeated in the 1958 election in which John Diefenbaker led the Progressive Conservative Party to a landslide victory.

Haidasz returned to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 election, now representing the Toronto riding of Parkdale. He retained his seat through five succeeding elections until 1978 when he became the first Canadian of Polish descent to be appointed to the Senate of Canada. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau recommended his appointment to the Senate to Governor General Jules Léger.

In 1964, he served as head of Canada&#x27;s delegation to the World Food Program in Geneva, and as a delegate to the United Nations General Assembly.

He served as parliamentary secretary to a number of ministers in the 1960s. In 1972, he was appointed to the Cabinet as Canada&#x27;s first Minister of State for multiculturalism and served in that position until 1974.

During his career, Haidasz was instrumental in the passage of Medicare, the Canada Pension Plan and Income Supplement, the Clean Air Act and other legislation. He also initiated the Anti-Smoking Tobacco Bill.

He retired from the Senate in 1998 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75.

He was awarded a Commander Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland in 1998.

<text>The Cup of Jamshid (, &quot;jām-e Jam&quot;) is a cup of divination, which in Persian mythology was long possessed by the rulers of ancient Greater Iran. Its name is associated with Jamshid (&quot;Jam&quot; in New Persian), a mythological figure of Greater Iranian culture and tradition. The cup has also been called &quot;Jam-e Jahan nama&quot;, &quot;Jam-e Jahan Ara&quot;, &quot;Jam-e Giti nama&quot;, and Jam-e Kei-khosrow. The latter refers to Kaei Husravah in the Avesta, and Sushrava in the Vedas.

The cup has been the subject of many Persian poems and stories. Many authors ascribed the success of the Persian Empire to the possession of this artifact. It appears extensively in Persian literature.

The cup (&quot;Jām&quot;) was said to be filled with an elixir of immortality and was used in scrying. As mentioned by Ali-Akbar Dehkhoda, it was believed that all seven heavens of the universe could be observed by looking into it (از هفت فلک در او مشاهده و معاینه کردی). It was believed to have been discovered in Persepolis in ancient times. The whole world was said to be reflected in it, and divinations within the cup were said to reveal deep truths. Sometimes, especially in popular depictions such as The Heroic Legend of Arslan, the cup has been visualized as a crystal ball. Helen Zimmern&#x27;s English translation of the Shahnameh uses the term &quot;crystal globe&quot;.

The seven-ringed Cup of Jamshid is spoken of in the classic poem Rubaiyat by the 11th century Persian Omar Khayyam. See the 5th verse in the 5th translation by Edward Fitzgerald:Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose, And Jamshyd&#x27;s Sev&#x27;n-ring&#x27;d Cup where no one knows; But still the Vine her ancient Ruby yields, And still a Garden by the Water blows.

It also finds mention in the Sawāneḥ, authored by Persian Sufi mystic Ahmad Ghazali:As long as the world-displaying goblet is in my hand, the wheel of heaven on high lowers itself before me / As long as the Kaʿba of non-being is the qebla of my being, the most sober man in the world is intoxicated by me.In 20th century literature, the cup was mentioned in by the poet, philosopher, and one of the founder fathers of Pakistan, Allama Muhammad Iqbal in his poem &quot;Tasvīr-i Dard&quot; &quot;The Portrait of Anguish&quot;:Urdu(romanized): &quot;Agar Dekha Bhi Uss Ne Sare Aalam Ko To Kya Dekha? Nazar Ayi Na Kuch Apni Haqiqat Jaam Se Jam Ko&quot;.

English(translated): Even if he viewed the whole world, what did he see? Jam could not see his own reality in the wine cup

<doc id="1094025" wikidata="Q6142355" url="?curid=1094025" title="USS Puffer (SS-268)">
<text>USS &quot;Puffer&quot; (SS-268), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the puffer.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Puffer&quot; was laid down by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin, on 16 February 1942; launched on 21 November 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Ruth B. Lyons, granddaughter of the oldest employee at Manitowoc Shipbuilding, Christian Jacobson, Sr.; and commissioned on 27 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander Marvin John Jensen in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Puffer&quot; was transported down the Mississippi to New Orleans on a special floating drydock, having periscope shears re-installed en route. After receiving torpedoes and ammunition, she exercised off Panama for a month, and then headed across the Pacific to Australia. &quot;Puffer&quot; arrived there in early September 1943.

===First and second war patrols, September 1943 – January 1944===

&quot;Puffer&quot;′s first war patrol, to intercept Japanese commerce in the Makassar Strait–Celebes Sea area, 7 September to 17 October, resulted in several damaged ships but no sinkings. On 9 October, after damaging a merchantman (&quot;Kumagawa Maru&quot;), she endured a nearly 38-hour depth charging from 2 Japanese sub chasers and was slightly damaged. On 24 November &quot;Puffer&quot; departed on her second patrol, in the Sulu Sea and the approaches to Manila. On 13 December, she made a successful attack on freighter &quot;Teiko Maru&quot; (ex-Vichy French steamship &quot;D&#x27;Artagnan&quot;). On 20 December she sank the old 820-ton escorting destroyer IJN &quot;Fuyō&quot;, and on 1 January 1944, 6,707-ton freighter &quot;Ryuyo Maru&quot;, before putting into Fremantle for refit 12 January.

===Third and fourth war patrols, February – June 1944===

&quot;Puffer&quot; departed for her third war patrol, in the South China Sea, 4 February. On 22 February, she sank the 15,105-ton transport &quot;Teikyo Maru&quot;. Returning to Fremantle 4 April, she departed again on her fourth war patrol on 30 April for Madoera Straits, Makassar Straits and the Sulu Sea. She acted as life guard for the first Allied carrier strike on Soerabaia, sank 3,181-ton freighter &quot;Shinryu Maru&quot; 18 May, then on 5 June, attacked three tankers, sinking 2,166-ton &quot;Ashizuri&quot; and 2,500-ton &quot;Takasaki&quot;. She ended this most successful patrol, for which she received the Navy Unit Commendation, at Fremantle 21 June.

===Fifth war patrol, July 1944 – ~ 1944===

On 14 July &quot;Puffer&quot; departed for her fifth war patrol, in Makassar Straits, the Celebes, Sulu, and South China Seas. She made contact with a submarine tender screened by five escorts on 21 July, spending three days following the group and using all but nine torpedoes to sink the tender.

Twenty-three days later, on 12 August, she made contact with a ten large vessels and their escorts. Five of the remaining nine torpedoes sank the 5,113-ton tanker &quot;Teikon Maru&quot; and a large freighter, with enough damage to beach another tanker. She completed the patrol at Pearl Harbor, whence she continued on to Mare Island for overhaul.

===Sixth and seventh war patrols, December 1944 – ~ 1945===

Following refresher training at Hawaii, &quot;Puffer&quot; got underway on her sixth war patrol 16 December. Operating in the Nansei Shoto area, she sank &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 42&quot; on 10 January 1945; and, prior to her arrival at Guam, 17 January, damaged a destroyer, three freighters, and a tanker.

By 11 February, &quot;Puffer&quot; was underway again for her seventh war patrol, and following patrols in Luzon Straits and the South China Sea, where she bombarded Pratas Island, she made an anti-shipping sweep of the Wake Island area.
===Eighth and ninth war patrols, May 1945 – ~ 1945===

Refitted at Midway she departed 20 May en route to the South China and Java Seas to conduct her eighth war patrol. In a surface sweep of the northern Bali coast, &quot;Puffer&quot; destroyed by gunfire two Japanese sea trucks and six landing craft on 5 July, and inflicted extensive damage to harbor installations at Chelukan Bawang and Buleleng, Bali. A brief respite at Fremantle followed, whence she headed north for her ninth and last war patrol, in the Java Sea.

===Post-World War II service===

Completing her ninth patrol with the cessation of hostilities in mid-August 1945, &quot;Puffer&quot; headed for Subic Bay, thence to the United States, reaching San Francisco 15 October. With the new year, 1946, &quot;Puffer&quot; returned to Hawaii where she trained officers and men in submarine warfare until returning to San Francisco, 19 March, for inactivation.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
&quot;Puffer&quot; decommissioned 28 June 1946, and was berthed at Mare Island as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. At the end of the year &quot;Puffer&quot; was ordered activated and assigned to the 13th Naval District for training Naval Reservists. Employed in that status, at Seattle, until relieved by 10 June 1960, &quot;Puffer&quot; was placed out of service and sold for scrapping to the Zidell Corporation, Portland, Oregon, on 4 November 1960.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Puffer&quot; earned 9 battle stars for World War II service in the Pacific Theater, with a total tonnage of 36,392 tons (eight ships).

* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with nine battle stars
* World War II Victory Medal
* Philippine Liberation Medal
* Navy Unit Commendation

<text>The Happy Hooker: My Own Story is a best-selling memoir by Xaviera Hollander, a call girl, published in 1971. It sold over 20 million copies. Robin Moore, who took Hollander&#x27;s dictations of the book&#x27;s contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy ghostwrote it. In an interview published in 2019, Hollander said Dunleavy &quot;was the one who wrote the book. They taped me, simply asking questions about my life and had the chapters spewed out in about three months. She wrote it, he edited it. He tried in vain to write a chapter, it was a piece of shit&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
Hollander&#x27;s book inspired a series of movies, starting with &quot;The Happy Hooker&quot; (1975), which starred Lynn Redgrave. The film was followed by two sequels: &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood&quot; (1980). In the sequels the role of Hollander was played by Joey Heatherton and Martine Beswick respectively.

<text>Charles Joseph Singer (2 November 1876 – 10 June 1960) was a British historian of science, technology, and medicine. He served as medical officer in the British Army.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Singer was born in Camberwell in London, where his father Simeon Singer was a rabbi and Hebraist. He was educated at City of London School, University College London, and Magdalen College, Oxford (Zoology 1896–99, Honorary Fellow 1953). Trained in zoology and medicine, he qualified for medical practice in 1903. He was appointed medical officer on an expedition led by Sir John Harrington to the border region between Abyssinia and Sudan on the same day his medical qualification was announced. He returned to England and took a position at Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, and in 1907 left for Singapore. Forced to return to England on his father&#x27;s death in 1908, he held positions at various hospitals in London until he moved to Oxford in 1914 to work with Sir William Osler, then Regius Professor of Medicine at the university.

===Later years===
Singer was married in July 1910 to Dorothea Waley Cohen, distinguished in her own right as an historian of the Medieval period. She provided valuable assistance in his publications for the remainder of his life. In the period leading up to World War I, Singer published several monographs, for which he was awarded the D.Litt. degree by Oxford.

Singer accepted a commission as medical officer in the British Army in 1916, first as a pathologist and then as part of an archaeological expedition. At war&#x27;s end, he returned to Oxford to lecture on the history of biology. In 1920 he was appointed to a lectureship in the history of medicine at University College of the University of London. He became president of the History of Medicine Society at the Royal Society of Medicine in London, in 1920. His reputation extended beyond England, and in 1929 he accepted an invitation to lecture at Johns Hopkins University the following year. Johns Hopkins was also interested in offering him a permanent post, but their delay allowed the University of London to award him an honorary chair, which he accepted. By the time Johns Hopkins made their formal offer, he was satisfied with his position in London and declined their offer. The Singers spent time in Berkeley where Charles spent three months as a visiting lecturer at the University of California, after which they returned home to London. He was invited again by the University of California at Berkeley to lecture in 1932, an occasion that the Singers used to circle the globe going westward, spending about sixteen months away from England. On their return, Singer resumed his post at UCL, where he remained until his retirement in 1942. His last great publication before retirement was &quot;A Short History of Scientific Ideas to 1900&quot;.

Singer was one of the two contributors to the revised and updated version for Encyclopædia Britannica of the bulk of Thomas Clifford Allbutt&#x27;s article &quot;Medicine&quot; which had been in the 11th edition. As revised for the 14th edition Singer&#x27;s part was &quot;Medicine, History of&quot; (in volume 15), which followed after Sir Humphry Rolleston&#x27;s &quot;Medicine, General&quot;.

Retirement was not idle for the Singers. Charles continued research into various topics and published several noteworthy books, including editing the monumental &quot;A History of Technology&quot;, which was released in five volumes between 1954 and 1958, &quot;Galen on Anatomical Procedures&quot;, and &quot;A History of Biology&quot;. Numerous articles were also published in this period, some of which remain important. He died in Par, Cornwall.

==Award and recognitions==
Charles Singer&#x27;s life was complemented by numerous awards, honors, and positions of leadership. Among these were an honorary degree (D.Sc.) from Oxford, and terms of presidency of several societies, including the British Society for the History of Science (1946–1948) and the International Union for the History of Science (1947). He was also a member of the International Society for the History of Medicine. He and his wife were co-awarded the Sarton Medal from the History of Science Society in 1956. He was elected an International Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1958.

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars (QOH), was a cavalry regiment of the British Army, formed from the amalgamation of the 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars and the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars at Candahar Barracks, Tidworth in 1958. The regiment served in Aden and Northern Ireland and as part of the British Army of the Rhine. The regiment was amalgamated with the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars to form the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars on 1 September 1993.

==History==
The regiment was formed from the amalgamation of the 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars and the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars at Candahar Barracks, Tidworth in November 1958. The regiment remained at Tidworth as an armoured regiment within 3rd Armoured Division. One squadron was sent to Warminster as Demonstration Squadron to School of Infantry in March 1959 and another was sent to Aden in February 1960. The regiment was re-deployed to York Barracks in Munster as an armoured regiment within 6th Infantry Brigade in July 1960 and then was sent to Hobart Barracks in Detmold as an armoured regiment in 20th Armoured Brigade Group in August 1962.

The regiment was re-roled as a training regiment based at Cambrai Barracks at Catterick Garrison in February 1965, except for one squadron which was deployed as Berlin Armoured Squadron in West Germany. In February 1967 the regiment moved to Maresfield from where squadrons were deployed to Aden in July 1967, to Sharjah in July 1967, to Singapore in October 1968 and to Cyprus in June 1969. It was re-roled again as an armoured regiment in 7th Armoured Brigade based at Caen Barracks in Hohne in August 1970: from there squadrons were deployed to Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles. It moved to Bovington Camp as the RAC Centre regiment in August 1974 and to Hobart Barracks in Detmold as an armoured regiment in 20 Armoured Brigade in May 1976 from where further tours in Northern Ireland were conducted. The regiment returned to Cambrai Barracks at Catterick as RAC Training Regiment in April 1983 and then re-roled as armoured regiment for 22nd Armoured Brigade at Caen Barracks in Hohne in January 1985. From there squadrons were deployed to Cyprus for duty as an armoured reconnaissance unit and to Northern Ireland for duty as the Maze prison guard force.

The regiment was amalgamated with the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars to form the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars on 1 September 1993.

<doc id="1094080" wikidata="Q2093576" url="?curid=1094080" title="Pierre Juneau">
<text>Pierre Juneau (October 17, 1922 – February 21, 2012) was a Canadian film and broadcast executive, a one-time member of the Canadian Cabinet, the first chairman of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and subsequently president of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He is credited with the creation, promotion, and championing of Canadian content requirements for radio and television. Juneau is the namesake of the Juno Awards.

==Early life==
He was born in Verdun, now part of Montreal, to a working-class family. After graduating from the Université de Montréal, he studied at the University of Paris where he met Pierre Trudeau, with whom he co-founded the dissident political magazine &quot;Cité Libre&quot; upon returning to Montreal.

He was the Jeunesse Étudiante Chrétienne (JEC) Canadian representative at the International Young Catholic Students (IYCS) Centre for International Documentation and Information (CIDI) in 1947–49. He is considered as one of the key men behind the creation of IYCS which today is present in over 80 countries with millions of members.

==National Film Board of Canada==
Juneau joined the National Film Board of Canada in 1949. Hired as the NFB&#x27;s French Advisor by commissioner Albert Trueman to see how the NFB could better meet the needs of francophone filmmakers and contemporary Quebec society, Juneau was one of the original proponents for the creation of a French-language production branch at the NFB.

In the 1950s, he was the NFB&#x27;s assistant regional supervisor in Quebec, and then became the chief of international distribution, the assistant head of the European office, and the NFB&#x27;s secretary. In 1964, he became the board&#x27;s Director of French-language production.

==Film festival founder==
In 1959, Juneau was a co-founder of the Montreal International Film Festival, and served as its president until 1968.

==CRTC==
In 1966, Juneau was appointed vice-chairman of the Bureau of Broadcast Governors and the last Chairman in March 1968. When the BBG became the Canadian Radio and Television Commission (CRTC) in 1968, Juneau became the body&#x27;s first chairman. In the early 1970s, he was the architect of the CRTC&#x27;s Canadian content regulations that require a certain percentage of radio and television time to be devoted to programming (or music in the case of radio) produced in Canada. Canadian content, by requiring radio stations to give air play to Canadian artists, is credited with creating a domestic market for Canadian music and the subsequent boom in music production. The music industry&#x27;s Juno Awards are named after Juneau, and in 1971 he received a special Juno award for &quot;Canadian music industry Man of the Year&quot;.

==Political career==
In 1975, Juneau left the CRTC to accept an appointment by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to the cabinet as Minister of Communications. Since Juneau did not have a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, he attempted to enter parliament through a by-election, but was defeated in the Montreal riding of Hochelaga by the Progressive Conservative candidate, Jacques Lavoie. Following constitutional convention which requires that a cabinet minister have or obtain a seat in parliament shortly after his appointment, he resigned from cabinet.

==Civil service==
He was subsequently appointed to the civil service by Trudeau as undersecretary of state, and then, in 1980, as deputy minister of communications.

==Canadian Broadcasting Corporation==
In 1982, he became president of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. As Juneau was closely identified with the Liberal Party, he was viewed with hostility by the Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney that came to power in the 1984 election. He clashed with the Mulroney government over budget cuts and its reorganization of the CBC but nevertheless completed his seven-year term.

Despite financial pressures, during his term as CBC president, Juneau inaugurated a new cable service, CBC Newsworld, and increased Canadian content on the CBC to 95% of programming.

<text>Ewell Ross McCright (4 December 1917 – 24 April 1990) of Benton, Saline County, Arkansas was a captain in the United States Air Force during World War II who was famous for maintaining secret journals detailing information about fellow prisoners of war while held captive in a German prison camp. For his actions, McCright was awarded the Legion of Merit posthumously in 2004.

McCright was a bombardier on a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber that was shot down over France on 23 January 1943. McCright was captured by German forces and taken to a German prisoner of war camp at Zagan, Poland. McCright remained a prisoner until 29 April 1945, when his camp was liberated by the Third United States Army under General George S. Patton.

During his captivity, McCright detailed the personal backgrounds and wartime injuries of 2,194 of his fellow prisoners in four journals, which he hid under the floorboards of the prisoner barracks. When he was transferred to another POW camp, McCright secretly carried the journals on a 34-mile forced march in place of food.

McCright&#x27;s ledgers contained prisoner accounts of the gas chambers at Auschwitz, as well as details of Nazi atrocities such as the use of dogs to attack prisoners, and medical experimentation on prisoners. McCright&#x27;s journals were presented as evidence before the allied war crimes trials at Nuremberg.

The ledgers were published in 1994 by Arnold Wright of Benton, Arkansas under the title &quot;Behind the Wire: Stalag Luft III, South Compound&quot;. McCright&#x27;s work provided comfort for many families seeking information about the status of their loved ones.

In 2004, McCright was the first recipient of the Legion of Merit to receive the award for activities conducted while a prisoner of war.

McCright became an attorney after the war and served in the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1951 to 1953. He died on 24 April 1990 at the age of seventy-two. He is buried at Salem Cemetery in Saline County.

<text>Camilla Eves (born Camilla Scott, July 12, 1961) is a Canadian actress and television host.

==Career==
Scott&#x27;s first starring role was the lead in &quot;Evita&quot; at the Limelight Dinner Theatre, a role she landed before she turned 25. Because her agent insisted that her name be billed above the title of the musical in all advertising, &quot;suddenly people thought I was a star&quot;, she said.

===Television===
She appeared on the soap opera, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, in 1990, portraying Melissa Anderson. The casting director was looking for a young actress who could sing. Surprised by a request to &quot;sing something,&quot; Scott started singing the last song she had heard on her car radio: Whitney Houston&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Love of All&quot;. The casting agent stopped her, saying, &quot;You really can sing.&quot; After meeting with the producer, she was hired and began filming the next day. She remained on the series for two years.

Scott hosted &quot;The Camilla Scott Show&quot; on the Baton Broadcast System (and later the CTV television network), a daytime talk show, from 1996 to 1998. 
The show received a poor critical reception; the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; wrote &quot;What could be less fun than licking a metal pole on a January morning with a crazed Shitzu scrabbling up your pant leg? According to the mostly male TV critics of middling years who write for the papers, the answer is Camilla Scott.&quot;

Concurrent with her talk show work, she had a recurring role in the TV series &quot;Due South&quot; as Inspector Margaret &quot;Meg&quot; Thatcher of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police from 1995 through 1999. She credited this role for helping her receive an award for community safety from her cellphone company. In 1996, she witnessed a mugging and called 911, giving a description of the mugger and his car that led to the mugger being arrested and the stolen goods being recovered. &quot;Maybe my role as an RCMP officer on Due South gave me the practice I needed to help in a real situation,&quot; she said.

In 2002, Scott had a voice role as Mama Bear in a television adaptation of the &quot;Berenstain Bears&quot;.

===Theatre===
Scott has performed in several Toronto musical theatre productions.

In 1994, Scott starred as Polly Baker in Mike Ockrent&#x27;s Toronto production of George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Crazy For You&quot; at the Royal Alexandra Theatre.

Scott appeared as the lead in the Toronto production of &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot; after Louise Pitre departed on tour. She continued in the role for three years.

She starred as Khashoggi, a role that previously had always been played by a man, in the Dora Award–winning Toronto production of the Queen musical &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;.
She took the role in October 2008,
and remained with the show until it closed on June 28, 2009.

===Multi-level marketing===
As her acting career wound down, Scott started working for Arbonne, a multi-level marketing company. As of 2020, she is now an Executive National Vice President for the company.

<doc id="1094101" wikidata="Q7270100" url="?curid=1094101" title="Queen's Royal Irish Hussars">
<text>The Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, abbreviated as QRIH, was a cavalry regiment of the British Army formed from the amalgamation of the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars and the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars in 1958. The regiment saw active service against insurgents in Aden; during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and during the Gulf War, as well as regular service in West Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine. The regiment was amalgamated with the Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars to form the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars on 1 September 1993.

==Early history==
The regiment was formed from the amalgamation of the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars and the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars in Hohne, West Germany on 24 October 1958. The regiment remained at Caen Barracks in Hohne as an armoured car regiment for 7 Armoured Brigade Group until June 1961 when it returned to the United Kingdom. In October 1961 it sailed on the TS &quot;Oxfordshire&quot; to Aden, reroling as an armoured reconnaissance regiment and after serving there against insurgents for almost a year, it was air-trooped to the newly independent nation of Malaysia. It was based in Ipoh, Malaysia from October 1962, and saw limited action against Indonesian insurgents, seeing service in Brunei and Sarawak on jungle operations during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. Soldiers from the regiment carried out searches for arms to prevent them falling into the hands of communist guerrillas; this included searching private houses.

Returning to West Germany in October 1964 the regiment became a recce unit based at Northampton Barracks in Wolfenbüttel. It moved to Perham Down in January 1968 and then transferred to Bovington Camp in September 1968 as RAC Centre regiment. It was re-roled as a tank regiment for 7th Armoured Brigade based at Barker Barracks in Paderborn in November 1970. From there it deployed a unit to Cyprus, as part of the UN peacekeeping force following the invasion of the northern part of the island by Turkey, in 1974.

The regiment moved to Bhurtpore Barracks at Tidworth Camp, as the reserve tank regiment, in July 1979 with a squadron detached to the School of Infantry at Warminster where it was used in the role of RAC Demonstration Squadron. It returned to West Germany as a tank regiment for 4th Armoured Brigade based at York Barracks in Munster in July 1982. From there it deployed to Northern Ireland as Prison Guard Force at the Maze Prison in 1983. Then in March 1988 half the regiment moved to Cambrai Barracks at Catterick Garrison as RAC Training Regiment while the other half moved to Bovington Camp as RAC Centre Regiment. It returned to West Germany as a tank regiment for 7th Armoured Brigade based at Wessex Barracks in Bad Fallingbostel in April 1990.

==Gulf War==

Iraq invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990. Prior to the war the regiment had just arrived in Fallingbostel as part of the 7th Armoured Brigade (under the command of Brigadier Patrick Cordingley), part of 1st (United Kingdom) Armoured Division, and was engaged in training on the Soltau-Lüneburg Training Area known to all as Soltau. The Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Denaro was recovering from a polo accident four weeks earlier when he had broken his skull in four places requiring a metal plate to be inset but was still taking part in the exercise. The other regiments in the brigade had recently undergone intensive training at BATUS in Canada which the Hussars missed, having just arrived with the British Army of the Rhine.

The ensuing British deployment to the Gulf was codenamed Operation Granby. The ground phase of the Gulf War took place between 23/24 February – 28 February 1991, was code named Operation Desert Storm by the U.S. Department of Defense.

The regiment trooped to the port city of Al Jubayl (scene of a later suspected chemical attack) and awaited the arrival of their 57 Challenger 1 tanks and other equipment. After the arrival of everything, grease had to be cleaned off, sand filters etc. fitted before the regiment made its way by tank transporter into the desert. After which training for the forthcoming combat began. At one point depleted uranium ammunition was issued at the rate of five rounds per tank. During one training day 14 of the 57 tanks broke down causing serious concerns for Colonel Denaro.

The Iraqi army knew the regiment was coming. Air bombardment and media interest ensured that they were well warned. Tanks and artillery were dug in across a wide front to provide a warm reception for the allies from the world&#x27;s fourth largest army. Casualty figures were predicted to be as high as 15000 for the allies, even General Schwarzkopf, the allied commander of land forces, estimated 5000.

H Hour was at 0300hrs on 24 February 1991: (G Day). The regiment was given the order to cross the start line at 0315hrs. With helicopters providing reconnaissance the tanks advanced to contact at speed. The first contact was not until 1628hrs when an Iraqi trench position was engaged with machine gun fire before surrendering.

On G+2 reports of a counterattack began to arrive at brigade headquarters. D Squadron under Captain (Acting Major) Toby Madison picked up fourteen thermal image contacts at maximum range and engaged. The battle went on for 90 minutes. Madison received the Military Cross for his command of the squadron in this action. The Iraqis were at a severe disadvantage as they had no night vision capability and were out-ranged by the British tanks with their thermal gunnery sights and superior tank guns. Captain Tim Purbrick commanding 4th Troop described firing fin at an Iraqi T55 tank, &quot;Our second round entered its glacis plate and exited through the gearbox at the rear, igniting its ammunition and destroying the tank at a range of three thousand six hundred metres.&quot; Also, on 26 February 1991, a British Army Challenger 1 scored the longest tank-to-tank &#x27;kill&#x27; in military history, when it destroyed an Iraqi T-55 at a range of 4.7 km (2.9 miles) with an APDS round.

Large numbers of prisoners were now surrendering to the regiment. They were passed rearwards to Regimental sergeant major Johnny Muir&#x27;s party who did their best to feed them and keep them safe. Rations were limited; however as no-one had considered that an armoured unit would have to deal with prisoners, often the food supplied was not as nourishing as that provided to the troops. Items such as oatmeal biscuits, which were effectively left overs from ration packs, were given along with water. One Iraqi medical officer expressed concern that he and his fellow prisoners were going to be shot. The RSM assured him that &quot;we are not barbarians&quot;.

The regiment continued its advance, destroying all in its path until it arrived at the map line &quot;Platinum&quot; at which point a halt was called for sleep for the first time in 48 hours. On G+3 the regiment resumed its advance in the company of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, the other armoured regiment in 7th Armoured Brigade. The regiment entered Kuwait through Wadi al-Batin. After fifteen kilometres travel recce troop stopped to collect prisoners and were fired up by two U.S. Abrams tanks, wounding Corporal Lynch and Corporal Balmforth, following this up by engaging Command Troop as it passed by.

Following the blue on blue incident Brigadier Cordingly ordered all vehicles to fly flags, banners or anything they could lay their hands on to show they were friendly. He felt the campaign was coming to a close and that vehicles from all nationalities were roaming everywhere and that this would lead to more friendly fire incidents. The Irish Hussars did not disappoint. Union flags and Ulster Banners quickly appeared. Colonel Denaro, a Roman Catholic from Donegal, led the advance into Kuwait from that point onwards with an Ulster flag supplied by his Northern Ireland Protestant crew fluttering from one of his tank&#x27;s antennae.

The regiment was then tasked on G+4 to take possession of the Basra to Kuwait City highway to prevent retreating Iraqi forces from escaping. This was done by 0800hrs. The ceasefire was then announced so the regiment went firm and started putting up bivouacs and tents. As the regiment left the area heading back to Al Jubayl for &quot;de-bombing&quot; the Regimental Sergeant Major was stopped by some civilians who said, &quot;Thank you for giving us back our country&quot;, which seemed to him to be a fitting end to the deployment. The regiment lost no casualties, no tanks were disabled or knocked out by enemy fire, and it took part in the destruction of over three hundred Iraqi tanks in a four-day period. Colonel Denaro&#x27;s Challenger 1 tank named &quot;Churchill&quot; is now preserved at The Tank Museum, Bovington with the list of its crew, Corporal John Nutt, Corporal Gerry McKenna and Trooper Les Hawkes.

==Regimental museum==

<text>Dan Able Kimball (March 1, 1896 – July 30, 1970) was the 51st U.S. Secretary of the Navy.

==Biography==
Kimball was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 1, 1896. He was an Army Air Service pilot during the First World War and maintained an intense interest in aviation thereafter. Beginning in 1920, he was employed by the General Tire and Rubber Company, rising to Vice President of that firm in 1942. He subsequently was an executive of the rocket engine producer Aerojet Engineering Company, a division of General Tire. He was appointed Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air in February 1949 and became Under Secretary of the Navy the following May.

Kimball assumed the post of Secretary of the Navy in July 1951 and held that position until the end of the Truman Administration in January 1953. His tenure was marked by the continuation of the Korean War, the resulting expansion of the nation&#x27;s defense establishment and considerable technological progress in aviation, naval engineering and other defense-related fields. Returning to business after leaving office, he was President and later Chairman of the Board of the Aerojet General Corporation until 1969. He died on July 30, 1970.

<text>Bongwater is a 1998 American black comedy film directed by Richard Sears and starring Luke Wilson, Alicia Witt, Amy Locane, Brittany Murphy, Jack Black and Andy Dick. Based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Michael Hornburg, the film is set in Portland, Oregon, and follows an aspiring artist and marijuana dealer and his relationship with a tempestuous woman he meets through a client.

==Plot==
David is a stoner living in Portland, Oregon. After having previously sold marijuana to a woman named Jennifer, he is introduced to her friend, the tempestuous Serena, who is immediately disliked by his friends, Robert and Tony, a gay couple.

Serena develops a liking to David after seeing the artwork he does in his spare time, and encourages him to make a career for himself. After moving into his house, she introduces him to Mary Weiss, the daughter of a local gallery owner who falsely claims to be an art curator.

Serena becomes frustrated with David&#x27;s lack of ambition, and decides to move to New York City with Tommy, a punk rocker and paranoid heroin addict. Before she leaves, she and David get into a fight, which ends in her burning down his house.

In New York, Serena becomes increasingly frustrated with Tommy&#x27;s paranoid antics. She meets Bobby one afternoon in a diner, and he invites her to move in with him in his apartment, which she discovers is actually a squat in the East Village.

In Portland, David begins a romance with Mary, and moves in with Robert, Tony, and Jennifer. While hiking with Mary, David runs into his friend Devlin, who is running a spiritual retreat in the woods, where they partake in LSD. While Mary marches through the woods with Devlin, David has a hallucination in which his deceased mother brings him lunch.

In New York, Serena and Jennifer attend a party, where Serena is date raped. The following day, she confesses to Jennifer she wants to return to Portland. They return the next day, but Serena is disheartened soon after when she discovers David and Jennifer having sex.

Several days later, David attends a 1980s-themed party with Jennifer, Robert, and Tony, which is busted by police. He flees to the rooftop, where he finds Serena sitting alone. She confronts him about him having sex with Jennifer, and he asks her if she&#x27;s planning on staying in Portland. She tells him she isn&#x27;t sure, and that she doesn&#x27;t want to become too comfortable there again. She apologizes for the fire she set at David&#x27;s house. They kiss, and then witness a UFO floating above them in the sky.

==Cast==
==Production==
The screenplay for the film was adapted from Michael Hornburg&#x27;s 1995 novel of the same name, which was based on his experience living in Portland in the mid-1980s; the Serena character in the film (originally named Courtney in the novel) is based on Courtney Love, whom Hornburg knew in Portland.

The film was shot on location in Portland, Oregon and New York City on a budget of $1,000,000.

==Release==
The film was released at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival on April 19, 1998. It was later released on DVD on July 13, 2001.

===Critical reception===
The film has mostly received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 17% of six critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 4.7/10.

Lael Loewenstein, film critic for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, gave the film a mixed review, writing: &quot;The latest entry in the growing field of indie youth ensemble films, &quot;Bongwater&quot; is an uneven, intermittently likable movie about a group of Portland residents for whom getting high is a way of life. While its fresh-faced but largely unknown cast members frequently rise above the material, pic isn&#x27;t distinctive enough to suggest it will yield more than a limited run in specialized markets.&quot;

Ann Limpert of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a &quot;B&quot; rating, writing: &quot;The title notwithstanding, this drug-laden laugh trip is more &quot;Reality Bites&quot; than &quot;Up in Smoke&quot;...Though [Wilson and Witt&#x27;s] lack of real chemistry makes the cuddly ending feel tacked on, the hysterical drug-buddy performances of Brittany Murphy, Andy Dick, and Jack Black really make this joint roll.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Robert Pardi gave the film a negative review, writing: &quot;This smoke-dream love story gives aimlessness a bad name: It&#x27;s hard to concur with the screenplay&#x27;s insistence that there&#x27;s both pathos and humor to be found in the bong-inhaling, bed-hopping lives of these indolent characters.&quot;

<text>The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars (The Queen&#x27;s Own and Royal Irish) (QRH) is a British armoured regiment. It was formed on 1 September 1993 from the amalgamation of the Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars. The regiment and its antecedents have been awarded 172 Battle Honours and eight Victoria Crosses. The regiment was based in Sennelager, Germany, until 2019 when it was relocated to Tidworth Camp, England. It is the armoured regiment for 20th Armoured Brigade Combat Team.

==History==
The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars was formed in Fallingbostel on 1 September 1993 from the amalgamation of the Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars. Home Headquarters was formed shortly thereafter at Regent&#x27;s Park Barracks in London where it remains today. After the amalgamation, the regiment became the cavalry of the following areas: Northern Ireland, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, West Midlands, Surrey, and Sussex. For a short time the regiment maintained a regimental band formed by the amalgamation of the two former regiment&#x27;s bands, designated as the Band of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars. However, following a reorganisation of the Army Music, the band was amalgamated with the Bands of the King&#x27;s Royal Hussars and Light Dragoons to form the Band of the Hussars and Light Dragoons on 1 September 1994, part of the new Corps of Army Music.

The Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, normally referred to by the abbreviation QOH, was a cavalry regiment of the British Army, formed from the amalgamation of 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Hussars and the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars at Candahar Barracks, Tidworth in 1958.

The Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, abbreviated as QRIH, was a cavalry regiment of the British Army formed from the amalgamation of the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars and the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars in Hohne, West Germany in 1958.

The regiment, in January 1996, became the first to be deployed in Challenger 1 tanks to Bosnia with NATO&#x27;s British-led Implementation Force IFOR. The regiment received the Canadian Forces&#x27; Unit Commendation for its actions in Bosnia on 15 June 1996.

In August 1997 the regiment deployed to Northern Ireland on Operation Banner and on their return moved in March 1998 to Athlone Barracks at Sennelager as armoured regiment for 20th Armoured Brigade. In 1999 the regiment converted to Challenger 2 tanks in which B Squadron deployed to Kosovo with 1PWRR Battle Group in August 2000. The regiment deployed to Kosovo in the dismounted role the following year from October 2001-April 2002.

December 2003 saw the regiment deploy once again, this time to Iraq on Operation Telic 3. The regiment saw its first Military Cross awarded to Lance Corporal Christopher Balmforth of B Squadron for his actions during an ambush in Basra.

April 2006 saw the regiment deploy once again to Iraq on Operation Telic 8 and December 2008 saw the regiment deployed to Iraq on Operation Telic 13. As the final Operation Telic The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars were intimately involved in the drawdown from the main British base and spent many hours escorting convoys to and from Kuwait. In 2011 the regiment deployed on Operation Herrick 15 as a ground holding Battle Group to Afghanistan in the infantry role: they worked with the Afghan National Police handing over control of checkpoints.

On return from Afghanistan in 2012 the regiment was called on to support the security for the London Olympic Games. The remainder of the year was used to return to the armoured role. 2013 saw C Squadron training with 5 Rifles on Exercise Bavarian Charger, mounted on Challenger 2. The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars Battlegroup, comprising sub-units from 5 Rifles and 1 PWRR deployed on Exercise Prairie Thunder 2 between July and August 2013.

In June 2014, the regiment deployed C Squadron to Operation Herrick 20 in Afghanistan, as the Warthog Group. This role involved crewing Warthog armoured tracked vehicles and operating with dismounted infantry from 5 RIFLES to disrupt insurgents in Helmand during the draw down of British troops from Camp Bastion. They were the last British combat units on the ground in Helmand.

The regiment moved to Tidworth with 20 Armoured Infantry Brigade, forming the senior of three Type 56 heavy armoured regiments of British Army&#x27;s Reactive Force, in 2019. In January 2025 they became one of the first infantry regiments to be outfitted with the new Ajax armoured fighting vehicle.

*The Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars Museum was located at The Redoubt Fortress in Eastbourne until it closed.

==The Regimental Crest &amp; Cap Badge==
The crest and cap badge are as follows:
* The Regimental Crest is made up from the Angel Harp of the 8th Hussars and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, which is placed above the White Horse of Hanover of the 3rd Hussars and The Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars. These are encircled by the Garter Belt, above which is placed the Queen&#x27;s Crown.
* The Regimental Cap Badge is made up from the Angel Harp of the 8th Hussars and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, superimposed on the Regimental cypher of The Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars, originally bestowed on the 7th Hussars in 1727; the whole is surmounted by the Queen&#x27;s crown and a lion, with a scroll underneath giving the Regiment&#x27;s title in blue and gold.

==Privileges &amp; traditions==
The regiment has gained a number of unique privileges and traditions:

Loyal Toast: Officers dining in the Regimental Officers’ Mess have the privilege of not drinking the loyal toast and ignoring the National Anthem when it is played at dinner. This originates from the Jacobite Rebellion in 1745 when all Army officers were required to drink to the health of the Sovereign in their messes after dinner as a token of loyalty. The King, however, absolved the Regiment (3H) from this, saying their loyalty was always beyond question. This privilege was re-affirmed by the Sovereign prior to amalgamation.

;Badges and Symbols
The White Horse of Hanover: Ranking second, after the Crown, among the regiment&#x27;s military badges, it was bestowed by the first three Georges to certain regiments for their part in suppressing the Jacobites. It was first granted, as a special head-dress badge, by King George I to The 3rd The King&#x27;s Own Regiment of Dragoons in 1715 for their part in defeating James Francis Edward Stuart (The Old Pretender).

Crossbelts: At the Battle of Almenar in 1710 the 8th Dragoons pursued the Spanish Cavalry Corps and, equipping themselves with the crossbelts of the enemy, cut down the Spaniards with their own swords. The crossbelts were worn with distinction for many years, and the nickname &#x27;St Georges Crossbelts&#x27; was given to the regiment. Although the crossbelt worn today is based on the original 4th Hussar pattern, the continuing tradition of titling the regimental journal &quot;The Crossbelts&quot; is in recognition of this famous action.

The Maid of Warsaw: Every member of the regiment wears the Maid of Warsaw, the coat of arms of the City of Warsaw, on the left sleeve of his No. 2 (Service) Dress. This honour was awarded to the 7th Hussars by the Commander of the Second Polish Corps in recognition of their valour in support of the Polish forces during the Italian campaign in World War II. Traditionally the original crest presented to the regiment is placed in front of the commanding officer on Dinner Nights.

The Fern Leaf: All vehicles in the regiment display the emblem of New Zealand, the fern leaf, to commemorate the association of The 3rd Hussars with the 2nd New Zealand Division at the Battle of El Alamein where the regiment lost all but five tanks breaching the German line. This honour was granted by General Lord Freyberg VC.

Kettle Drums: By command of King George II the silver kettle drums captured by The King&#x27;s Own Regiment of Dragoons, later The 3rd Hussars, at Dettingen are borne by a drum horse ridden by a sergeant kettledrummer - both being additional to the regimental establishment. The drums are always carried at the head of the regiment on ceremonial parades and are, uniquely amongst cavalry regiments, never covered by drum banners, the battle honours being engraved directly onto the sides of the drums. In 1772 when Lord Southampton commanded the regiment, his wife gave a silver collar to be worn by the kettledrummer, which is still worn today when parading in full dress with the drums. The present drum horse is named Alamein and its nickname is Dudley.

;Other traditions

Winston Churchill: Winston Churchill, who has been described as &#x27;the greatest Hussar of them all&#x27;, was commissioned into the 4th Hussars in 1895, and later became the colonel of the regiment from 1941, until the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Hussars was amalgamated with the 8th Hussars in 1958, after which he became colonel of the new regiment, Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars, remaining so until his death in 1965. In recognition of this, the Churchill Cup is awarded to the top-scoring troop in the regiment&#x27;s annual gunnery competition. The commanding officer&#x27;s tank is also named &#x27;Churchill&#x27;.

;Regimental Colours
The colours are as follows:
*&quot;Garter Blue&quot;: The primary colour of the regiment is garter blue. This dates from when the Queen Consort&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons, later the 3rd Hussars, wore the queen&#x27;s livery with garter blue feathered hats. It has been in continuous use ever since.
*&quot;Green&quot;: The use of green dates from 1748 when it was the facing colour of Princess Anne of Denmark&#x27;s Regiment of Dragoons, later the 4th Hussars. It has an association with Ireland, which remains a recruiting area for the regiment. Officers and senior ranks wear green jumpers and all ranks wear green berets. Officers can be distinguished by their distinctive tent hats (the only item of army headdress worn without a cap badge other than with combat uniforms).
*&quot;Yellow&quot;: The traditional Light Cavalry colour is yellow, which has been used by all of the regiment&#x27;s predecessors.

;Regimental song
The lyrics of the song go:
I&#x27;m a soldier in the King&#x27;s Army.
I&#x27;m a galloping Queen&#x27;s Hussar.
I&#x27;ve sailed the ocean wide and blue.
I&#x27;m a chap who knows a thing or two.
Been in many a tight corner.
Shown the enemy who we are.
I can ride a horse.
Go on a spree, or sing a comic song.
And that denotes a Queen&#x27;s Hussar.


===The Regimental Pipes and Drums===
The Pipes and Drums were inherited from the Queen&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars. There has been no formal adoption of pipe music by the regiment, but the pipe tunes have become very much a part of regimental parades, the following tunes have become part of the regiment&#x27;s music.

* Killaloe Composed by Robert Martin in 1887 as part of the show &quot;Miss Esmeralda&quot;.
* The Minstrel Boy The original words were composed by Thomas Moore, set to an old traditional Irish air originally named &quot;The Moreen&quot;.
* Highland Cathedral A modern slow melody composed by M Korb for bagpipes, it is a haunting tune used as a slow march.
* St Patrick&#x27;s Day Played by the Irish Pipes at the battle of Fontenoy in 1745, though it has long been a popular patriotic Irish song.

===Regimental days===
The following are celebrated as battle honour days:

* Dettingen 27 June
* Balaclava 25 October
* El Alamein 2 November

St Patrick&#x27;s Day is also celebrated.

<text>Bongwater was an American psychedelic rock band, which formed in 1987 and dissolved in 1992. The group was founded by Ann Magnuson and Mark Kramer (who was also the founder of the Shimmy Disc record label), who had worked together previously in Pulsallama. The group also featured drummer David Licht and guitarists Dave Rick and later Randolph A. Hudson III. Guests included Fred Frith, Peter Stampfel and Fred Schneider.

==Overview==
Earlier recordings consisted of psychedelic-era cover songs, sound collages and originals in an abrasive and/or abstract, dense and sludgy experimental style with often dreamy and cacophonous vocals by Magnuson on the songs &quot;Frank&quot; (a sardonic &quot;tribute&quot; to Frank Sinatra) and &quot;Dazed and Chinese&quot; (Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, sung in Cantonese). The band&#x27;s style ultimately evolved into a more poppy, sexy approach which still retained an experimental edge as well as retaining the surreal and wicked, often self-deprecating wit which had distinguished the group&#x27;s earlier releases. Lengthy sound collages would often terminate or begin the songs and without warning, a spoken word monologue (often taken from Magnuson&#x27;s dream journal excerpts) might cut into the music.

They distinguished themselves as interpreters of songs by other artists and in particular of 1960s psychedelic rock songs, although they also covered occasional oddities like &quot;Bedazzled&quot; by Dudley Moore. They made &quot;Kisses Sweeter Than Wine&quot; by The Weavers, &quot;The Drum&quot; by Slapp Happy and &quot;You Don&#x27;t Love Me Yet&quot; by Roky Erickson into virtual signature tunes. The former was made into a tribute to Bobby, Magnuson&#x27;s late brother, and others lost to AIDS. A number of their other songs made reference to this. This included their arguably biggest college radio hit &quot;Folk Song&quot;.

The group created a number of arty low budget home movie-style music videos, three directed by Magnuson&#x27;s then-boyfriend, Brad Dunning. However a more slick and polished example, &quot;The Power of Pussy&quot;, strangely, aired on the Playboy Channel, which also financed its production.

Bongwater had two major college radio hits, &quot;The Power of Pussy&quot; and the nine-minute &quot;Folk Song&quot;, and some college radio chart success. Personality clashes and money issues caused the duo to split up with much acrimony.

<doc id="1094139" wikidata="Q3566344" url="?curid=1094139" title="Warner Center, Los Angeles">
<text>Warner Center is a master-planned neighborhood and business district development in the Canoga Park and Woodland Hills neighborhoods of the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, California.

Warner Center, which began as a master-planned area, is designated as a Regional Center within the City&#x27;s Canoga Park-West Hills-Winnetka-Woodland Hills Community Plan. Historically, Warner Center is generally bounded by Vanowen Street to the north, the Ventura Freeway to the south, De Soto Avenue to the east, and Topanga Canyon Boulevard on the west. The Warner Center 2035 Plan (adopted in December 2013) added the area between Vanowen and the LA River to the plan area, which comprises approximately 1,100 acres or 1.7 square miles.

The area was originally planned to relieve traffic to and from downtown Los Angeles, as well as generate jobs in the San Fernando Valley. It was first envisioned in the late 1960s.

==History==
Warner Center is named for Harry Warner, the eldest of the Warner Brothers, who owned the land since the 1940s, which he used as a horse ranch. His family donated of land in 1967 that became the Warner Center Park (also known as the Warner Ranch Park), situated east of Topanga Canyon Boulevard between Califa Street and Marylee Street.

In 1968, Robert Allison, then the manager for the San Fernando Valley office of Coldwell Banker, arranged the sale of of the land to Aetna Life and Casualty for $30 million. Aetna acquired the land for long-term investment and development purposes, and later brought in Kaiser as a joint venture partner. Mr. Allison spearheaded the early land planning, subdivision and development efforts on behalf of Kaiser Aetna.

Initially, large tracts of the Warner Ranch land were developed in the Canoga Park portion, between Victory Boulevard and Vanowen Avenue. Topanga Plaza was first, followed by engineering facilities and headquarter offices for the aerospace companies Rocketdyne and Litton Industries.

With the sale of the land to Aetna, the pace of development in Warner Center accelerated. Kaiser Aetna acted as a master developer, offering land for sale or lease, buildings for sale or lease, and leased buildings built to owner&#x27;s specifications. Development sites from very small parcels up to 100 or more acres were offered.

In the ensuing 20 years, much of the build-out of Warner Center occurred, including approximately 4,300 multi-family dwelling units, and millions of square feet of commercial and office space. Notable developments include:

* The Promenade Mall which opened in 1973.
* Kaiser Permanente Hospital, which opened in 1986.
* The 1.1 million square foot Warner Center Business Park built in the mid to late 1970s, consisting of low and mid-rise office and industrial buildings.
* The 1.8 million square foot Warner Center Plaza built out from the early 1980s to the early 1990s, with its signature high-rise office buildings that feature reflective glass exteriors and give Warner Center its distinct skyline. The complex includes Warner Center Plaza I (constructed in 1980, completed in 1982, and opened in 1983), Warner Center Plaza VI (constructed in 1986, completed in 1988, and opened in 1989), and Warner Center Plaza III (constructed in 1988, completed in 1990, and opened in 1991).
* The Trillium office project, consisting of twin 17-story office towers totaling 600,000 square feet, built in the late 1980s.

Real estate developer Robert Voit, in partnerships with Robert Allison and New England Life Insurance Company, developed the Warner Center Business Park and Warner Center Plaza. The partnerships were wound down in the early 1990s and since that time the ownership of the properties has become fragmented.

During the 1990s following the completion of the Warner Center Plaza project, relatively little new development occurred. The economic slowdown of the early 1990s, combined with the damage from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, served to put the brakes on new development for the rest of the decade.

The next major project was LNR Warner Center, which was built at the site of the former Prudential Life Insurance Company buildings between 2001 and 2005, totaling over 1.4 million square feet of primarily office space.

Also, in the early 2000s, a flurry of new multifamily housing projects were built. This burst of residential building created concerns in the community about issues such as traffic. In reaction to these concerns, City Councilmember Dennis Zine initiated a restudy of the Warner Center Specific Plan in 2005.

The Warner Center 2035 Plan (WC 2035 Plan) is a development blueprint for Warner Center that emphasizes mixed-use and transit-oriented development, walkability, and sustainability.

A Citizen&#x27;s Advisory Committee was established in 2005, consisting of members of the local neighborhood councils including the Woodland Hills-Warner Center Neighborhood Council and the Canoga Park Neighborhood Council as well as business and property owners, which worked with city planning staff and its consultants to develop the plan. In December 2013 the plan was adopted by the Los Angeles City Council.

By 2035, the plan anticipates an additional:
* 14 million square feet of nonresidential building area
* 20,000 residential dwelling units
* 49,000 jobs

In 2011, the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot; quoted City Planner Ken Bernstein as describing a new vision for Warner Center as more &quot;cosmopolitan, 21st century.&quot; The paper added: &quot;The plan would allow 40-story skyscrapers. Small retail shops — where locals could walk to buy basics — would be encouraged, in an area now dominated by national chains and big malls. The long superblocks and six-lane thoroughfares would be &#x27;cut up&#x27; by adding paseos and crosswalks to create a more intimate feel for pedestrians.&quot;

In 2012 the City Council approved the Village at Westfield Topanga - which included a new Costco, as well as a massive retail, dining, and entertainment development that would combine with two existing Westfield Warner Center malls (Westfield Topanga Mall and Westfield Promenade Mall).

The , The Promenade, was sold in March 2022 to sports owner and real estate developer Stan Kroenke for approximately $150 million. The combined was expected to be developed into a permanent team headquarters and practice facility for the Los Angeles Rams. The Westfield shopping center called The Village was purchased in January 2023 for $325-million bringing the total property ownership to . The center continues to operate as an open-air lifestyle and retail destination.

==Transit==
In October 2005, the Orange Line was established creating an east–west link across the San Fernando Valley linking Warner Center with North Hollywood and the Metro Red Line. In June 2012, the Orange Line was expanded to include a north–south line connecting Warner Center with Chatsworth and the Metrolink system. The G Line (name changed in 2020) no longer serves Warner Center and is replaced with Metro Route 601 which runs between the Canoga station and Warner Center.

==Emergency services==

===Fire service===
Los Angeles Fire Department Station 84 (Woodland Hills) and Station 72 (Canoga Park) serve Warner Center.

===Police service===
Security officers employed by Allied Universal Security Services continuously monitor and patrol all buildings, parking structures, and loading docks.

==Hospital==
Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Medical Center is a general medical and surgical hospital in Warner Center. Kaiser Permanente Medical Center consists of a 175-bed hospital and serves 2 million residents of the San Fernando Valley. Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Hospital, a non-profit general medical and surgical facility, is operated by Kaiser Foundation Hospital.

The hospital had 12,600 admissions in the latest year for which data are available. It performed 4,055 annual inpatient and 5,197 outpatient surgeries. Its emergency room had 38,131 visits. Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Hospital is the highest ranked hospital in the San Fernando Valley, and ranked 13th highest hospital among Los Angeles-area hospitals because of its strength in specialties such as cancer, diabetes, endocrinology, gynecology, orthopedics and urology.&quot;

<text>WPXA-TV (channel 14) is a television station licensed to Rome, Georgia, United States, broadcasting the Ion Television network to the Atlanta area. The station is owned and operated by the Ion Media subsidiary of the E. W. Scripps Company, and maintains offices on North Cobb Parkway (US 41) in Marietta; its transmitter is located on Bear Mountain, near the Cherokee–Bartow county line.

Channel 14 went on the air February 29, 1988, as WAWA-TV. The station was built by Sudbrink Broadcasting, which had acquired the permit from American Communications &amp; Television prior to launch. After operating for two and a half years as a general-entertainment independent station with local news for the Rome area, Sudbrink moved the station into the Atlanta market with a new transmitter facility, new WTLK-TV call letters, and a prime time lineup of local and national talk shows. Neal Boortz, Suzette Charles, and Hosea Williams were among WTLK-TV&#x27;s lineup of hosts. The station suffered from an inability to gain channel space on Atlanta&#x27;s cable systems and by 1993 was mostly airing reruns and country music videos. It was acquired by Paxson Communications, forerunner to Ion Media, in 1994 and became an infomercial station; these stations formed the core of the Pax network, predecessor to Ion, in 1998.

==History==
===WAWA-TV: Construction===
In March 1984, after an agreement among four applicants with the channel, American Communications &amp; Television (AC&amp;T) of Gainesville, Florida, won the construction permit to build channel 14 in Rome, the city&#x27;s first station since what was then WROM-TV on channel 9 moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, as WTVC in 1957. AC&amp;T selected the call sign WZGA and proposed a conventional general-entertainment independent station, but it prioritized constructing KOOG-TV in Ogden, Utah, deferring the construction to late 1985 after deciding to move the tower from Mount Alto to a site on Vineyard&#x27;s Mountain in Bartow County so the station to extend its signal into Cobb County. AC&amp;T sold the construction permit to Sudbrink Broadcasting of West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1986. Sudbrink elected to proceed with the original Mount Alto site; in November 1987, Sudbrink bought a building on Shorter Avenue to house the station&#x27;s studios.

Channel 14 began telecasting as WAWA-TV on February 29, 1988. The station offered talk shows, movies, sitcoms, and two local newscasts each day.

===WTLK-TV: Talk TV for Atlanta===
Soon after launching, Sudbrink sought to move WAWA-TV into the much larger Atlanta television market. On February 1, 1990, zoning officials in Cherokee County approved the construction of a new tower on Pine Log (or Bear) Mountain, northwest of Canton; Sudbrink also planned to build a second studio in Cherokee County, in Woodstock; its later decision not to do so led to a lawsuit with the county zoning board. The new transmitter facility, constructed at a cost of $2 million, was activated in December 1990. Shortly prior, the station changed its call sign to WTLK-TV ahead of its plan to implement a 24-hour talk-show format.

In March 1991, WTLK-TV signed a lease for studio facilities in Marietta, en route to a planned June 1 launch of its all-talk format, and picked up two NBC game shows not aired by local affiliate WXIA-TV. It also announced that it would discontinue its Rome-area local newscasts but retain the Shorter Avenue studios and offices. The initial phase was intended to bring talk programming to prime time during the week with planned expansion later.

The new local talk shows debuted on June 17, 1991. Five nights a week, the station presented &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; with former Miss America Suzette Charles and Michael Young, previously of ESPN, as well as &quot;Talk at Nite&quot;, hosted by WGST&#x27;s Brian Wilson. Two other shows alternated: &quot;The Mike Roberts Show&quot;, hosted by WVEE&#x27;s morning host, and &quot;Boortz!&quot;, hosted by Neal Boortz (then also of WGST). The prime time lineup was finished out with two national syndicated shows: &quot;Phil Donahue&quot; and &quot;Sally Jessy Raphael&quot;. In debuting its ambitious new programming, WTLK-TV immediately ran into a major problem. Must-carry rules for local stations on cable systems were not then in effect, and Atlanta cable providers were not adding WTLK to their lineups. After failing to land a slot on any local cable system, Sudbrink conducted a round of layoffs in September 1991, including Young. Suzette Charles departed effective December 1, finding the operation &quot;not up to my professional standards&quot;. At one point, Boortz was telling his radio listeners that WTLK would end all of its talk shows on January 17, 1992, with no cable slot in sight. Boortz departed in March 1992, and the next month, Wilson lost his job hosting &quot;Talk at Nite&quot; when he engaged in an on-air tirade prompted by technical miscues. Hosea Williams came aboard as a weekly shot host after their departures. That August, WTLK added &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, which local CBS affiliate WAGA-TV was preempting to air a local morning show.

By 1993, WTLK-TV&#x27;s schedule consisted mostly of &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, country music videos, and reruns. That year, Joel Babbit almost bought the station with plans to expand its talk lineup to 24 hours, with a broader topic mix including home improvement and gardening shows and a model of selling a sponsorship for each talk hour. Babbit abandoned the plan when he became an executive at Whittle Communications less than two months later.

===Paxson/Ion ownership===
In 1994, Sudbrink sold WTLK-TV to Paxson Communications Corporation, which initially proposed a Christian format. It was Paxson&#x27;s second television station that it owned, after WPBF serving West Palm Beach, and alongside a station it managed in Miami. Shortly after the acquisition, Atlanta&#x27;s major cable systems finally added WTLK to their lineups; previously, it had only been on some smaller suburban systems. During this time, the station became the new television home of Atlanta Knights minor-league hockey. Paxson announced the creation of its Infomall TV infomercial network in January 1995 and included WTLK-TV among its first stations.

On August 31, 1998, the Paxson-owned stations formed the nucleus for the new Pax TV network. The station&#x27;s call sign had been changed that January to WPXA-TV. In the early 2000s, WPXA-TV entered into a joint sales agreement with WXIA-TV, under which the latter station sold channel 14&#x27;s local advertising and WPXA rebroadcast two of WXIA-TV&#x27;s newscasts. WPXA also aired the Atlanta Falcons coach&#x27;s show as part of WXIA-TV&#x27;s partnership with the NFL team. After changing its name to i: Independent Television in 2005, the network became known as Ion Television in 2007.

==Subchannels==
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

WPXA-TV began digital broadcasts on channel 51 on January 5, 2002. The digital signal remained on channel 51 until 2014, when its channel was changed to 31 to eliminate interference with wireless communications service on adjacent frequencies. In September 2019, WPXA-TV moved from channel 31 to 16 as a result of the spectrum incentive auction.

<text>Leonard Stephen &quot;Len&quot; Marchand (November 16, 1933 – June 3, 2016) was a Canadian politician. He was the first person of First Nations status to serve in the federal cabinet, after being the first Status Indian elected and serving as a Member of Parliament. He was also the first First Nations person to serve as a Parliamentarian. He served as Parliamentary Secretary, Minister of State, Minister of the Environment and Senator.
==Early life==
Marchand was born in Vernon, British Columbia on November 16, 1933. A member of the Okanagan Indian Band, he attended school at the Okanagan Indian Day School, the Kamloops Indian Residential School and Vernon high school. He went on to graduate from the University of British Columbia in 1959 with a Bachelor of Science degree in agriculture. In 1964 Marchand later completed a master&#x27;s degree in range management from the University of Idaho. After pursuing a career as an agronomist, he left the field in the mid-1960s to work with the North American Indian Brotherhood. His work in native affairs took him to Ottawa to lobby on Aboriginal issues. He was hired as a special assistant to two successive Cabinet ministers.

==Career==
Marchand entered politics and was elected to the House of Commons in the 1968 election as a Liberal Party candidate for the British Columbia riding of Kamloops-Cariboo. He defeated high-profile Progressive Conservative candidate E. Davie Fulton. He was the first Status Indian to be elected as an MP.

He became parliamentary secretary to Jean Chrétien, who was the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, helping persuade Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to begin land settlement negotiations between the federal government and the First Nations.

In 1976, Marchand was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister of State for small business. He was the first Status Indian to be appointed to a cabinet position. In 1977, he was promoted to Minister of the Environment, and held the post until his and the government&#x27;s defeat in the 1979 election.

Marchand returned to British Columbia where he became administrator for the Nicola Valley Indian Administration. In 1984, he was appointed to the Senate, the second First Nations Canadian to be appointed (the first was officially James Gladstone, but in reality was Guy Williams). Marchand persuaded the Upper House to establish the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, on which he served as chairman.

Marchand retired from the Senate in 1998 at the age of 64, eleven years ahead of the mandatory retirement age, in order to spend more time in British Columbia. He died on June 3, 2016.

Member of Parliament Robert Falcon Ouellette gave a tribute to Len Marchand in the House of Commons on June 9, 2016.

== Family ==
Marchand is the father of Leonard Marchand Jr., the Chief Justice of British Columbia and Chief Justice of the Court of Appeal of Yukon, and Lori Marchand, the Managing Director of Indigenous Theatre at the National Arts Centre.

==Legacy and honours==
*In 1999, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada.
*In 2000, Caitlin Press published his autobiography, &quot;Breaking Trail.&quot;
*In 2014, Marchand received the Order of British Columbia.




* Marchand was sworn in as a Member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on September 15, 1976, giving him the accordant style &quot;The Honourable&quot; and the post-nominal letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.
