<text>Catharine Macaulay (née Sawbridge, later Graham; 23 March 1731 – 22 June 1791) was a famed English Whig historian. She was the first Englishwoman to become an historian and during her lifetime the world&#x27;s only published female historian. She was the first English radical to visit America after independence, staying there from 15 July 1784 to 17 July 1785 including time at Mount Vernon with George Washington and his family.

==Life==
Catharine Macaulay was a daughter of John Sawbridge (1699–1762) and his wife Elizabeth Wanley (died 1733) of Olantigh. Sawbridge was a landed proprietor from Wye, Kent, whose ancestors were Warwickshire yeomanry.

Macaulay was educated privately at home by a governess. In the first volume of her &quot;History of England&quot;, Macaulay claimed that from an early age she was a prolific reader, in particular of &quot;those histories which exhibit liberty in its most exalted state in the annals of the Roman and Greek Republics… [from childhood] liberty became the object of a secondary worship&quot;.

However this account is at odds with what she told her friend Benjamin Rush, to whom she described herself as &quot;a thoughtless girl till she was twenty, at which time she contracted a taste for books and knowledge by reading an odd volume of some history, which she picked up in a window of her father&#x27;s house&quot;. She also told Caleb Fleming that she knew neither Latin nor Greek.

Little is known about her early life. In 1757, a Latin and Greek scholar, Elizabeth Carter, visited a function at Canterbury where she met Macaulay, then 26 years old. In a letter to a friend, Carter described Macaulay as a &quot;very sensible and agreeable woman, and much more deeply learned than beseems a fine lady; but between the Spartan laws, the Roman politics, the philosophy of Epicurus, and the wit of St. Evremond, she seems to have formed a most extraordinary system&quot;.

On 20 June 1760 she married a Scottish physician, Dr. George Macaulay (1716–1766), and they lived at St James&#x27;s Place, London. They remained married for six years until his death in 1766. They had one child together, Catharine Sophia. Macaulay moved to Bath in 1774. At age 47, she was married a second time on 14 November 1778 to William Graham (then 21 years old). This caused some scandal.

The marriage coincided with the publication of the first volume of &quot;The History of England from the Revolution to the Present Time, in a Series of Letters to the Reverend Doctor Wilson&quot; (1778) in which she argued that the English Civil War had not gone far enough to eliminate the prerogatives of the crown. Her arguments against monarchy challenged moderate elements in the Whig party.

She later lived in Binfield, Berkshire.

According to Mary Hays, Macaulay &quot;had been furnished by general Washington with many materials&quot; for a history of the American Revolution but that &quot;she was, by the infirm state of her health&quot; stopped from doing so. Macaulay wrote to the American writer Mercy Otis Warren in 1787: &quot;Tho&#x27; the History of your late glorious revolution is what I should certainly undertake were I again young, yet as things are I must for many reasons decline such a task&quot;.

She died in Binfield in Berkshire on 22 June 1791 and was buried in All Saints&#x27; parish church there.

==&quot;The History of England&quot;==

Between 1763 and 1783 Macaulay wrote, in eight volumes, &quot;The History of England from the Accession of James I to that of the Brunswick Line&quot;. However, when completing the last three volumes she realised she would not reach 1714 and so changed the title to &quot;The History of England from the Accession of James I to the Revolution&quot;. Being practically unknown before the publication of the first volume, overnight she became &quot;the Celebrated Mrs. Macaulay&quot;. She was the first Englishwoman to become an historian and during her lifetime the world&#x27;s only published female historian.

The &quot;History&quot; is a political history of the seventeenth century. The first and second volumes cover the years 1603–1641; volumes three and four cover 1642–1647; volume five covers 1648–1660; volumes six and seven cover 1660–1683 and the last volume spans 1683–1689. Macaulay chose this period because, as she wrote in the first volume, she wanted &quot;to do justice...to the memory of our illustrious ancestors&quot;. She lamented that her contemporaries had forgotten that the privileges they enjoyed had been fought for by &quot;men that, with the hazard and even the loss of their lives, attacked the formidable pretensions of the Stewart family, and set up the banners of liberty against a tyranny which had been established for a series of more than one hundred and fifty years&quot;.

She believed that the Anglo-Saxons had possessed freedom and equality with representative institutions but that these were lost at the Norman Conquest. The history of England, in Macaulay&#x27;s view, was the story of the struggle of the English to win back their rights that were crushed by the &quot;Norman yoke&quot;. She viewed the Commonwealth of England as &quot;the brightest age that ever adorned the page of history...Never did the annals of Humanity furnish the example of a government, so newly established, so formidable to foreign states as was at this period of the English Commonwealth&quot;. The Long Parliament was &quot;the most patriotic government that ever blessed the hopes and military exertions of a brave people&quot;. The Parliamentarian army&#x27;s fighting &quot;was not a trade of blood, but an exertion of principle, and obedience to the call of conscience, and their conduct was not only void of insolence but benevolent and humane&quot;.

Macaulay justified the execution of King Charles I by claiming that &quot;Kings, the servants of the State, when they degenerated into tyrants, forfeited their right to government&quot;. Following the argument of John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Defence of the People of England&quot;, she argued that &quot;the oaths of allegiance were to be understood as conditionally binding, according to the observance of the oaths kings made to their people. And neither the laws of God nor nature were against the peoples laying aside Kings and Kingly government, and the adopting more convenient forms&quot;.

She was heavily critical of Oliver Cromwell, who she denounced as &quot;the vain-glorious usurper&quot; and as an &quot;individual, no ways exalted above his brethren in any of those private endowments which constitute the true greatness of character, or excelling in any quality, but in the measure of a vain and wicked ambition&quot;. He was responsible for ending a &quot;period of national glory...when England after so long a subjection to monarchical tyranny bad fair to out-do in the constitution of its government...every circumstance of glory, wisdom and happiness related of ancient or modern empires&quot;.

Her view of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 was critical. She acknowledged that the Revolution Settlement limited the power of the crown and had rejected &quot;hereditary indefeasible right&quot; in favour of &quot;a contract with the people&quot; as the basis of the monarchy&#x27;s power. However, she also claimed that patriots had neglected &quot;this fair opportunity to cut off all of the prerogatives of the crown&quot;, to which they had &quot;justly imputed the calamities and injuries sustained by the nation&quot;. The Revolution Settlement had failed to &quot;admit of any of those refinements and improvements, which the experience of mankind had enabled them to make in the science of political security&quot;.

Macaulay shared her fellow radicals&#x27; anti-Catholicism, writing in the chapter covering the Irish Rebellion of 1641 of the Papists&#x27; &quot;never-ceasing attempts by every kind of means, to bring all things again to subjection to the Church of Rome; their avowed maxim that faith is not to be kept with heretics; their religious principles calculated for the support of despotic power, and inconsistent with the genius of a free constitution&quot;.

Throughout her &quot;History&quot;, Macaulay showed a concern for her subjects&#x27; moral character and conduct. Self-interest was in her eyes the worst fault a king or politician was capable of. She criticised &quot;their apparent devotion to politics for personal gain rather than for the advancement of liberty&quot;. Her approach was a moralising one as she believed that only a virtuous people could create a republic.

Whigs welcomed the first volumes of the &quot;History&quot; as a Whig answer to David Hume&#x27;s &quot;Tory&quot; &quot;History of England&quot;. However, in 1768, relations between her and the Whigs cooled. Volume four of the history was published; this dealt with the trial and execution of Charles I. Macaulay expressed the view that Charles&#x27;s execution was justified, praised the Commonwealth of England and revealed republican sympathies. This caused her to be abandoned by the Rockingham Whigs.

Thomas Hollis recorded in his diary (30 November 1763) that &quot;the history is honestly written, and with considerable ability and spirit; and is full of the freest, noblest, sentiments of Liberty&quot;. Horace Walpole wrote to William Mason, quoting with approval Thomas Gray&#x27;s opinion that it was the &quot;most sensible, unaffected and best history of England that we have had yet&quot;.

Early in 1769, Horace Walpole recorded dining with &quot;the famous Mrs. Macaulay&quot;: &quot;She is one of the sights that all foreigners are carried to see&quot;. However, Walpole later changed his opinion: &quot;The female historian as partial to the cause of liberty as bigots to the Church and royalists to tyranny, exerted manly strength with the gravity of a philosopher. Too prejudiced to dive into causes, she imputes everything to tyrannic views, nothing to passions, weakness, error, prejudice, and still less to what operates oftenest and her ignorance of which qualified her less for a historian—to accident and little motives&quot;.

William Pitt praised the &quot;History&quot; in the House of Commons and denounced Hume&#x27;s Tory bias. Also approving were Joseph Priestley and John Wilkes. Around 1770, Lord Lyttelton wrote that Macaulay was &quot;a very prodigy&quot;, with portraits of her &quot;on every print-seller&#x27;s counter&quot;. There was a Derby figure of porcelain made of her and one of Patience Wright&#x27;s first life-sized wax figures was of Macaulay. James Burgh wrote in 1774 that Macaulay wrote &quot;for the purpose of inculcating on the people of Britain the love of liberty and their country&quot;. The French statesmen Mirabeau, Jacques Pierre Brissot and the Marquis de Condorcet admired the &quot;History&quot; as a corrective to Hume. In 1798, the French Ministry of the Interior recommended the &quot;History&quot; in a list of works suitable for school prizes.

Her fame came to an end in 1778 when she remarried, with many of her friends and supporters dropping her. She henceforth disappeared into obscurity, only occasionally re-emerging into the public eye.

Macaulay also wished to write a &quot;History of England from the Revolution to the Present Time&quot;, however only the first volume (covering 1688–1733) was completed.

==Politics==
Macaulay was associated with two political groups in the 1760s and 1770s: the Real Whigs and the Wilkites. She was also sympathetic with the cause of the American Colonists. However, she was more interested in polemic than everyday strategy. She was a supporter of John Wilkes during the Wilkesite controversy of the 1760s and closely associated with the radical Society for the Supporters of the Bill of Rights. Both of these groups wanted to reform Parliament.

The Tory Samuel Johnson was a critic of her politics:
Sir, there is one Mrs. Macaulay in this town, a great republican. One day when I was at her house, I put on a very grave countenance, and said to her, &quot;Madam, I am now become a convert to your way of thinking. I am convinced that all mankind are upon an equal footing; and to give you an unquestionable proof, Madam, that I am in earnest, here is a very sensible, civil, well-behaved fellow-citizen, your footman; I desire that he may be allowed to sit down and dine with us.&quot; I thus, Sir, shewed her the absurdity of the levelling doctrine. She has never liked me since. Sir, your levellers wish to level &quot;down&quot; as far as themselves; but they cannot bear levelling &quot;up&quot; to themselves. They would all have some people under them; why not then have some people above them?

In 1790, Macaulay claimed she was only talking about political inequality, she insisted she was not &quot;arguing against that inequality of property which must more or less take place in all societies&quot;.

Macaulay opposed Catholic emancipation, criticising in 1768 those &quot;who pretend to be friends of Liberty and (from an affectation of a liberal way of thinking) would tolerate Papists&quot;. She regarded the people of Corsica as being &quot;under Popish Superstition&quot; and recommended the works of Milton to enlighten them.

She supported the exiled Corsican Pasquale Paoli. In her &quot;Sketch of a Democratical Form of Government&quot;, she advocated a two chamber state (Senate and People). She wrote that &quot;The second order is necessary because ... without the people have authority enough to be thus classed, there can be no liberty&quot;. The people should have the right to appeal a court&#x27;s decision to the Senate and the People. Also, there should be a rotation of all public offices to prevent corruption. An agrarian law was needed to limit the amount of land an individual could inherit to prevent the formation of an aristocracy. She claimed that there needed to be &quot;an unrestrained power lodged in some person, capable of the arduous task of settling such a government&quot; and claimed that this should be Paoli. However, Paoli distanced himself from Macaulay as his sole concern was sustaining English support for Corsica rather than intervening in domestic politics.

Macaulay attacked Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents&quot;. She wrote that it contained &quot;a poison sufficient to destroy all the little virtue and understanding of sound policy which is left in the nation&quot;, motivated by &quot;the corrupt principle of self-interest&quot; of &quot;Aristocratic faction and party&quot; whose over-riding aim was a return to power. Burke, in her estimation, had failed to see that the problem lay in the corruption which had its origins in the Glorious Revolution. Parliament was reduced to &quot;a mere instrument of regal administration&quot; rather than controlling the executive. Macaulay advocated a system of rotation for MPs and &quot;a more extended and equal power of election&quot;.

None of Macaulay&#x27;s historical or political works were concerned with women&#x27;s rights. In her support for parliamentary reform, she did not envisage granting the vote to women. She was heavily influenced by the works of James Harrington, especially his belief that property was the foundation of political power.

During a visit to France in 1774, she dined with Turgot, who enquired whether she wanted to see the Palace of Versailles. She replied that &quot;I have no desire to see the residence of the tyrants, I haven&#x27;t yet seen that of the Georges&quot;.

Her last work was a pamphlet reply to Burke&#x27;s &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790). She wrote that it was right that the French had not replaced Louis XVI as this would have complicated their task to ensure liberty. She replied to Burke&#x27;s lament that the age of chivalry was gone by claiming that society should be freed from &quot;&quot;false&quot; notions of honour&quot; which were nothing more than &quot;methodized sentimental barbarism&quot;.

Whereas Burke supported the inherited rights of Englishmen rather than the abstract rights of man, Macaulay claimed that Burke&#x27;s theory of rights as gifts of monarchs meant that monarchs could just as easily take away the rights they had granted. Only by claiming them as natural rights could they be secured. The &quot;boasted birthright of an Englishman&quot; she had always thought of as &quot;an arrogant pretension&quot; because it suggested &quot;a kind of exclusion to the rest of mankind from the same privileges&quot;.

== Feminism ==
Macaulay is a central figure in the history of women&#x27;s political thought. Like English philosopher and feminist Mary Astell (1666-1731), Macaulay&#x27;s work anticipated ideas that would later be associated with feminist political theory such as concerns about women, consent, and the social contract. In her &quot;Loose Remarks on Certain Positions to be found in Mr. Hobbes&#x27;s &#x27;Philosophical Rudiments of Government and Society&quot;&#x27; (1767), Macaulay criticized Thomas Hobbes&#x27;s construction of patriarchy and paternal right. Although predominantly a historian, Macaulay developed her own theory of politics. She criticized absolute monarchs and despotic regimes—and the patriarchy that she believed made both possible. She outlined her elements of her own form of popular or republican government. Scholarly interest in her feminism has led to more attention to her critique of patriarchy and her political theory (beyond her works of history). Scholars have also noted the relationship between her feminism and religious ideas.

In addition, scholars have noted Macaulay&#x27;s impact on early feminist Mary Wollstonecraft, author of &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; (1792). Macaulay and Wollstonecraft both wrote on themes such as education, freedom as independence, equality, virtue, reputation, injustice, history, and false ideas. Wollstonecraft recognized the impact when she wrote to Macaulay: &quot;You are the only female writer who I coincide in opinion with respecting the rank our sex ought to endeavour to attain in the world. I respect Mrs Macaulay Graham because she contends for laurels while most of her sex only seek for flowers.&quot;

Macaulay&#x27;s work challenged the political and legal world of her time. British law relied on coverture: a husband “covered” the legal identity of a married woman so that, by a “fiction of the law,” marriage joined husband and wife into one legal person represented solely by the husband. As the head of household, the husband controlled a married woman&#x27;s wages and body as well as their children. Coverture began in England in the 12th century and continued to control legal thinking in common law countries (such as Great Britain and the United States) into the 20th century. Macaulay&#x27;s political works interrogated the subordination of women in British society and law. 

==&quot;Treatise on the Immutability of Moral Truth&quot;==

She was a lifelong member of the Church of England, although her apparent free expression of heterodox religious opinions shocked some of her contemporariness and led to accusations of infidelity. In her &quot;Treatise&quot; she wrote that God was &quot;omnipotent in the largest sense of the word, and that his works and commands&quot; were &quot;founded in righteousness and not in mere will&quot;. The &quot;Treatise&quot; revealed her optimism about humanity and the belief in the attainment of perfection in individuals and society. She also claimed that reason, without faith, was insufficient and wrote of the need for the Church to concentrate &quot;on the practical doctrines of the Christian religion&quot;, such as man&#x27;s God-given powers of bettering his own condition and reducing evil. She also rejected the idea of an inherent human nature: &quot;There is not a virtue or a vice that belongs to humanity, which we do not make ourselves&quot;.

Macaulay believed in the afterlife. When she became dangerously ill in 1777 in Paris, she told a friend that death did not scare her for it was but &quot;a short separation between virtuous friends&quot; after which they would be reunited &quot;in a more perfect state&quot;.

==&quot;Letters on Education&quot;==
She wrote in 1790 in her &quot;Letters on Education&quot;, as Mary Wollstonecraft did two years later in &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot;, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.

In the &quot;Letters&quot; she wrote &quot;the thoughts of a fatherless universe, and a set of beings let loose by chance or fate on one another, without other law than power dictates and opportunity gives a right to exact, chills the sensibility of the feeling mind into indifference and despair&quot;.

==American visit==
Macaulay wrote pamphlets criticizing the policy of the British Government in the lead up to the Revolution and she was personally associated with many leading figures among the American Revolutionaries. She was the first English radical to visit America after independence, staying there from 15 July 1784 to 17 July 1785. Macaulay visited siblings James Otis and Mercy Otis Warren. Mercy wrote afterwards that Macaulay was &quot;a lady whose Resources of knowledge seem to be almost inexhaustible&quot; and wrote to John Adams that she was &quot;a Lady of most Extraordinary talent, a Commanding Genius and Brilliance of thought&quot;. According to Mercy&#x27;s biographer, Macaulay had &quot;a more profound influence on Mercy than had any other woman of her era&quot;. She then visited New York and met Richard Henry Lee, who afterwards thanked Samuel Adams for introducing him to &quot;this excellent Lady&quot;. Upon the recommendation of Lee and Henry Knox, Macaulay stayed at Mount Vernon with George Washington and his family. Afterwards, Washington wrote to Lee of his pleasure at meeting &quot;a Lady ... whose principles are so much and so justly admired by the friends of liberty and mankind&quot;.

Macaulay wrote to George Washington on October 30, 1789 in which she offered analysis of the American Revolution and Washington responded January 9, 1790. During this period she corresponded with John Adams and Abigail Adams, James Otis and Mercy Otis Warren, Benjamin Franklin and Sarah Prince-Gill, among numerous other colonists.

<text>Charles Mackay (27 March 1814 – 24 December 1889) was a Scottish poet, journalist, author, anthologist, novelist, and songwriter, remembered mainly for his book &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot;.

==Early life==
Charles Mackay was born in Perth. His father, George Mackay, was a bombardier in the Royal Artillery, and his mother Amelia Cargill died shortly after his birth. 

Mackay was educated at the Caledonian Asylum, in London. In 1828 he was placed by his father at a school in Brussels, on the Boulevard de Namur, shortly taken over by William James Joseph Drury; and studied languages. 

In 1830 he was engaged as a private secretary to William Cockerill, the ironmaster, near Liège, began writing in French in the &quot;Courrier Belge&quot;, and sent English poems to a local newspaper called &quot;The Telegraph&quot;. In the summer of 1830 he visited Paris, and he spent 1831 with Cockerill at Aix-la-Chapelle. In May 1832 his father brought him back to London, where he first found employment in teaching Italian to the future opera manager Benjamin Lumley.

===Family===
Mackay was twice married—first, during his Glasgow editorship, to Rosa Henrietta Vale, by whom he had three sons and a daughter; and secondly to Mary Elizabeth Mills, who was likely a servant in the household previously. His first wife died on 28 December 1859, and his second wife in 1875. The novelist Marie Corelli was an illegitimate daughter, presumably conceived while her mother was working in the household.

==Journalist==
Mackay engaged in journalism in London: in 1834 he was an occasional contributor to &quot;The Sun&quot;. From the spring of 1835 till 1844 he was assistant sub-editor of &quot;The Morning Chronicle&quot;. In the autumn of 1839 he spent a month&#x27;s holiday in Scotland, witnessing the Eglintoun Tournament, which he described in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, and making acquaintances in Edinburgh. In the autumn of 1844, he moved back to Scotland, and became editor of the &quot;Glasgow Argus&quot;, resigning in 1847. He worked for &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot; in 1848, becoming editor in 1852.

==Later life==
Mackay visited North America in the 1850s, publishing his observations as &quot;Life and Liberty in America: or Sketches of a Tour of the United States and Canada in 1857–58&quot; (1859). During the American Civil War he returned there as a correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot;, in which he was the first to publish the news of the Fenian conspiracy.

Mackay had the degree of LL.D. from the University of Glasgow in 1846. He was a member of the Percy Society. He died in London.

==Works== 

Mackay published &quot;Songs and Poems&quot; (1834), a &quot;History of London&quot;, &quot;The Thames and its Tributaries or, Rambles Among the Rivers&quot; (1840), &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; (1841).

Mackay wrote a historical romance titled &quot;Longbeard&quot;, about the medieval rebel William Fitz Osbert. He is also remembered for his &quot;Gaelic Etymology of the Languages of Western Europe&quot; and the later &quot;Dictionary of Lowland Scotch&quot; in which he presented his &quot;fanciful conjectures&quot; that &quot;thousands of English words go back to Scottish Gaelic&quot;. The linguist Anatoly Liberman has described MacKay as an &quot;etymological monomaniac&quot; commenting that &quot;He was hauled over the coals by his contemporaries and never taken seriously during his lifetime&quot;. In 1877, Mackay published his two-volume &quot;Forty Years&#x27; Recollections of Life, Literature, and Public Affairs. From 1830 to 1870&quot; (London: Chapman &amp; Hall). In volume 2, Mackay describes a journey he made to Famine Ireland in 1849 (pp. 2:76–148).

His fame chiefly rested upon his songs, some of which, including &quot;Cheer Boys Cheer&quot;, were set to music by Henry Russell in 1846, and had an astonishing popularity. Some popular poems include &quot;You have no enemies, you say?&quot; and &quot;Who shall be fairest?&quot;

Mackay also authored a book in 1885 on the Founding Fathers of the United States titled &quot;The Founders of the American Republic: A History and Biography&quot; that included profiles on George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and James Madison.

<text>Charles Macklin (26 September 1699 – 11 July 1797), (Gaelic: Cathal MacLochlainn, English: Charles McLaughlin), was an Irish actor and dramatist who performed extensively at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Macklin revolutionised theatre in the 18th century by introducing a &quot;natural style&quot; of acting. He is also famous for accidentally killing a man during a fight over a wig at the same theatre.

Macklin was born in County Donegal in the Irish region of Ulster in the north of Ireland. He was raised in Dublin, where he attended school in Islandbridge after his father&#x27;s death and his mother&#x27;s remarriage. Macklin became known for his many performances in the tragedy and comedy genre of plays. He gained his greatest fame in the role of Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice.&quot; Macklin enjoyed a long career which was often steeped in controversy before dying aged 97.

==Early life==
It is thought that Macklin was born near Culdaff, a village in Inishowen in the north of County Donegal in the province of Ulster, Ireland, in 1690, and moved to Great Britain in either 1725 or 1726; the dates in his early life are not entirely clear. According to William Archer in &quot;Eminent Actors&quot;, &quot;at his death, Macklin was believed to be 97, but his biographers have endeavoured to show that he was at least 107. The main lines of controversy are to be found in the 3 biographies of Congreve, Kirkman, and Cook&quot;. Thomas Kirkman and William Cooke, in &quot;Eminent Actors&quot;, assert that &quot;William MacLochlainn, father of Charles Macklin, had a daughter and a son, who were born two months prior to the Battle of the Boyne, which took place in 1690&quot;. Given this information, this would make Macklin 107 years old at his death. However, in his own words, he was born &#x27;in the last year of the last century&#x27;, making the year 1699 the year of his birth. In fact, &quot;The Monthly Mirror&quot; of February 1796, a year before his death, stated that: &quot;Macklin, according to this statement, must be in his hundred and sixth year, or thereabouts, whereas he is in fact no more than ninety-seven&quot;. According to William Archer, author of &quot;Eminent Actors&quot;, there &quot;were no registers of births, deaths, and marriages kept in Ireland in 1690&quot;.

Given this information, we must once again go with the very words of Macklin himself who quoted &quot;that he was born in the last year of the last century&quot;. His early life may remain a mystery, but we can be certain of his age at death. His family&#x27;s surname was McLaughlin, but &quot;seeming somewhat uncouth to the pronunciation of an English tongue&quot;, he changed it for the English stage. He found various jobs as an actor in London, but, apparently, his Ulster accent was an obstacle to success and he could not find a steady theatre home until he was noticed in a small character role in Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Coffee-House Politician&quot; at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields in 1725. It was after that fine performance, that would go unnoticed by a lesser actor, that he was snatched up by the Theatre Royal on Drury Lane as an actor and a resident acting manager, serving with James Quin. Their relationship was professional, but full of plenty of animosity. Macklin devotes a lengthy section of his memoirs to Quin, giving examples of their disagreements. Macklin admits that &quot;nothing but the necessity of business could ever make them associate together&quot;. Even the necessity of business sometimes dissolved; however, after some contract and pay disagreements in the 1741–42 season, Macklin and nearly the entire Drury Lane resident company left and attempted to find work elsewhere.

==Shylock and other roles==
Macklin&#x27;s most important role, the one that catapulted him to stardom in eighteenth-century London, was Shylock in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; on 14 February 1741. For several decades, the popular version of the play was a &quot;fixed&quot; text by George Granville, titled &quot;The Jew of Venice&quot;. In it, many roles were expanded, while Shylock and others were dramatically shortened. The eighteenth-century audiences were used to seeing a comic Shylock.

Macklin wanted a different path to playing this character. While Macklin did not return to Shakespeare&#x27;s script exactly as it was written, he did make his own edits to his script that were much closer than Granville&#x27;s text. Instead of portraying Shylock as the usual comic pantolone, he played him as darkly villainous, serious, and highly satirical. Next, rather than dress Shylock as a clown, Macklin researched his role. He studied Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, and in the old testament. He learned that Italian Jews, especially from Venice, were known to wear red hats, so he took that as a basis for his costume. In seeking to portray Jews exactly how they looked, Macklin emphasised the notion of historical accuracy in costuming, which would later become an inherent feature of realism in the 19th century. Macklin did not merely &quot;study&quot; the Jews. According to Appleton, &quot;he actually interacted with them in marketplaces and learned to gradually adapt their way of speech&quot;.

Finally, opening night came. This faithfulness to Shakespeare&#x27;s original intent for the character, combined with Macklin&#x27;s revolutionary method of attempting some semblance of realism in his performance, resulted in uproarious applause. Macklin himself confesses, &quot;On my return to the green-room, after the play was over, it was crowded with nobility and critics, who all complimented me in the warmest and most unbounded manner&quot;. King George II saw the production and was so moved he could not fall asleep that night. &quot;This is the Jew/ That Shakespeare drew&quot; is a phrase attributed to Pope.

Many tried to replicate Macklin&#x27;s performance of Shylock, but none of the six actors that attempted the role at the rival Covent Garden theatre from 1744 to 1746 were able to match nearly the acclaim that Macklin had received for his Shylock. Even Macklin was unable to match his performance. He did have a varied career, filled with at least 490 roles, but none of them were anywhere near the uproar his Shylock caused. Even his two closest in hype, roles from The Confederacy and Love for Love, were roles designed to emulate Shylock. He played Shylock for nearly the next fifty years, as well as Iago in &quot;Othello&quot; and the Ghost in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot;, he played the part of Mosca. He was the creator of Sir Pertinax Macsycophant, a famous burlesque character, and he was &quot;Macbeth&quot; at Covent Garden in 1772, in a production with authentic Scottish costumes.

Together with David Garrick, his student, friend, and partner, Macklin revolutionised acting in the 18th century. Garrick and Macklin eventually had a falling out in the mid-1740s, which derailed Macklin&#x27;s rise whilst propelling Garrick&#x27;s own career. Macklin, then the stage manager at Drury Lane, participated in an actor walkout. When the actors, led by Garrick, were forced to accept the owner&#x27;s terms, they had to abandon Macklin, who, as the stage manager, could have quelled the actors&#x27; strike, rather than participated in it. Macklin felt betrayed by Garrick and the other actors and he refused the £3 a week that Garrick offered him.

He also acted regularly in Dublin, in the Aunger Street and Smock Alley Theatres and in the Crow Street Theatre, which he founded in 1758.

Macklin was replaced by Samuel Foote at Drury Lane when he was appearing in &quot;An Englishman in Paris&quot;. It was written by Foote and he took Macklin&#x27;s role. Maria Macklin remained in the cast and Macklin opened his own establishment in 1753. He opened a tavern at which he gave a nightly lecture followed by a debate, which Macklin called the British Inquisition. According to some histories, Macklin claimed at one of these shows to have such a good memory that he could recite any speech after reading through it once. As a challenge, Samuel Foote allegedly wrote &quot;&quot;, a nonsense poem designed to be particularly difficult to memorise. The word Panjandrum has since passed into the English language.

In about 1768 Johan Zoffany created a painting of Macklin&#x27;s renowned role of Shylock. Maria Macklin was included in the painting in the role of Portia and Jane Lessingham is at the foot of the dias. The painting is unusual in that it includes the lawyer Lord Mansfield to the left who may have commissioned the painting. The painting is now in The Tate in London.

Macklin returned to the stage, but finally retired in 1789, when he found he was no longer able to recall the entire part of Shylock. He lived another eight years, supported by the income from a subscription edition of two of his best plays, &quot;The Man of the World&quot; and &quot;Love in a Maze&quot;.

==Playwright==
He wrote many plays, including &quot;Love a la Mode&quot; (1759), &quot;The School for Husbands, or The Married Libertine&quot; (1761), and &quot;The Man of the World&quot; (1781). &quot;The True-Born Irishman&quot; (1763), renamed &quot;The Irish Fine Lady&quot; for its English production, was a hit in Ireland, but a flop in England. Macklin observed: &quot;I believe the audience are right. There&#x27;s a geography in humour as well as in morals, which I had not previously considered.&quot; Brian Friel used the play as the basis for his one-act &quot;The London Vertigo&quot; produced in Dublin in 1992.

==Introduction of naturalistic acting==
Macklin revolutionised acting in the 18th century by introducing a natural style of acting, being the first actor of his generation to break away from the old declamatory style. According to Wilson Goldfarb, &quot;the predominant approach to acting in the 18th century is usually described as bombastic or declamatory, terms that suggest its emphasis on oratorical skills&quot;. Due to this emphasis on speaking, rehearsal time was short, stage movement was standardised, and actors often spoke directly to the audience rather than characters onstage. Wilson and Goldfarb go on to say that there were a few innovators who were &quot;opposed to the emphasis on declamation, stereotypical positions of performers onstage, and singsong delivery of verse; they wanted to create individual characters, and they wanted to have more careful rehearsal procedures&quot;. As a performer, Macklin was confined to the mainstream practices of 18th-century theatre companies but, through training young actors, he was able to put his ideas into practice.

==How Macklin trained his students==
Appleton states that &quot;Macklin believed acting a science, founded upon nature. He stressed the importance of a thorough knowledge of one&#x27;s role, of propriety of dress, and of attention the business of the scene; the necessity of avoiding monotony of tone&quot;. It was not uncommon for Macklin to advise a student to unlearn all they had learned about acting. According to Appleton &quot;Macklin made this the preliminary condition for all of his pupils. To hesitate was to be instantly dismissed. But once the condition had been agreed to, Macklin proved a dedicated teacher, willing to take infinite pains and often willing to instruct them for nothing&quot;. Most importantly, Macklin wanted his students to speak as they would in everyday life; basically transferring reality to the stage. Appleton portrays how Macklin trained his students to do this: &quot;In the garden of his Drumcondra, Dublin house, two of his pupils would stroll down two parallel walks while Macklin walked in the middle. They would walk for ten paces, and then exchange bits of conversation. They would repeat this many times until Macklin was satisfied in every particular&quot;. In this way, Macklin drilled his students until they acquired an ease of speech and manner. To cope with projection in the theatres, Macklin would often recite from Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; or soliloquies from Macbeth or Othello, having his students to imitate him in clarity, speech, and volume. Appleton adds that &quot;while he concentrated primarily on achieving clear and natural diction, he stressed as well the importance of mastering variety of tone and pause to indicate transitions of thought and associations of ideas&quot;. Macklin taught his students three fundamental pauses: moderate, longer, and grand. Each type of pause served an important function depending on the scene.

Macklin was one of the forerunners to stress the need to regularise rehearsals. Appleton states that &quot;actors, compelled by the repertory system to know scores of parts, generally relied on conventional attitudes, gestures, and tones to carry them through a performance and felt little enthusiasm for this discipline. Sometimes they were absent from rehearsals. Often they arrived late, stumbled through their lines and drifted away&quot;. Macklin was not only concerned about his individual actors, but with the whole production, and so everyone had to come prepared and on time. This led to a relentless discipline unmatched in other students at the time. For the rest of his life, Macklin would continue to train his students with such intensity and passion and through them, make an important contribution to the English Theatre.

==Marriages==
During the 1730s Macklin was involved in a relationship with an Irish actress. Her name was thought to be Ann Grace or Ann Grace Purvor. She was a noted actress and she assumed the name of Macklin although it is likely the pair never married. Their daughter, Maria Macklin (1733–1781), became a popular actress. Ann died on 28 December 1758 and he began an affair with his servant Elizabeth Jones, whose age was matched to that of his daughter. They had a long relationship before they were married on 13 February 1778.

==Legal problems==
Macklin lived a tempestuous life, often involved in lawsuits, sometimes acting as his own lawyer. In 1735 he quarrelled with a fellow actor named Thomas Hallam, whom he accidentally killed by thrusting his cane through Hallam&#x27;s eye. The pair had argued over a wig whilst performing a new farce, &quot;Trick for Trick&quot;. The incident occurred in the Scene Room of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in front of many witnesses, and Macklin, after the sudden fit of temper, was sorry and arranged for a physician to attend to Hallam. The cane had pierced through Hallam&#x27;s eye into his brain and he died one day later. Macklin was tried for murder, conducted his own defence and, though not acquitted, escaped with manslaughter. The punishment for manslaughter was the branding of a letter &#x27;M&#x27; upon the hand, by this period not with a hot but with a cold iron, although there is no evidence that this was actually carried out on Macklin. In 1772 he sued the organizers of a riot among the theatregoers who had demanded that he be fired. He recovered £600, but chose to accept instead the defendants&#x27; purchase of £100 in tickets at three benefits for himself, his daughter and the management.

==Death and legacy==

He lived a long life and may have died a centenarian, although that is not without doubt. While his second wife gave his birth year as 1690 on the memorial tablet installed in St. Paul&#x27;s Church, Covent Garden, making him 107 at his death; others have suggested that he was born in 1699 or 1710. His memorial shows a dagger piercing the eye of a theatrical mask, a contrite reference to his altercation with Thomas Hallam.

Macklin&#x27;s famous role as Shylock and introduction of naturalistic acting would later influence realism in the 19th century. Macklin&#x27;s drive and discipline to perfect himself as an actor and teacher still inspires theatre practitioners today. Macklin is remembered today in his native Inishowen, where the Charles Macklin Autumn School is held each October in the village of Culdaff.

<doc id="1095877" wikidata="Q7052556" url="?curid=1095877" title="Norman Macleod (Caraid nan Gaidheal)">
<text>Norman MacLeod, known in Gaelic as &quot;Caraid nan Gàidheal&quot; (&quot;friend of the Gael&quot;), was a Church of Scotland minister, poet, and writer. He was Chaplain to Queen Victoria and Dean of the Chapel Royal in Scotland.

==Life==
He was the son of the Rev. Norman Macleod, D.D. (1745 – 1824), and father of the Rev. Norman Macleod (1812 – 1872).

MacLeod was a distinguished minister of the Scottish Church, and studied at Edinburgh. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Mull in 1806. He became one of the most distinguished ministers, and most popular preachers of his Church, becoming Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1836. He was Dean of the Chapel Royal and a trusted friend of Queen Victoria. He preached to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert during their second visit to Scotland in 1844.

He was an enormously influential writer of Gaelic prose, founding and editing two of the earliest Gaelic periodicals, &quot;An Teachdaire Gaelach&quot; (&quot;The Highland Messenger&quot;) (1829–32) and &quot;Cuairtear nan Gleann&quot; (&quot;The Traveller of the Glens&quot;) (1840–43), as well as later contributing to &quot;Fear-Tathaich nam Beann&quot; (&quot;The Mountaineer&quot;) (1848) edited by his son in law, the Rev. Archibald Clerk. He was an enthusiastic proponent of Gaelic education and the welfare of Highlanders. As a smooth operator in church politics he secured the support of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for a Highland education scheme in 1824, with the purpose of teaching the people of the Highlands and Islands to read the Bible, catechism and other material in their native Gaelic. Within a few years these schools had an attendance in excess of 22,000, while other Gaelic Schools Societies and the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) were similarly bringing literacy in Gaelic to many more.

MacLeod published a &#x27;reader&#x27; for the General Assembly Schools in 1828. This, the periodicals, and a further collection of writings published in 1834 as &quot;Leabhar nan Cnoc&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Hills&quot; subtitled &#x27;things old and new for the education and improvement of the Gael&#x27;) covered a very wide range of material, from discussion of Chartists, Luddites and electoral reform to volcanoes and the natural world, encompassing subjects as diverse as politics, religion, current affairs, popular science, emigration, animal husbandry, technological developments and city life. Much of it was humorous, and written in the form of soap opera-like sketches and letters &#x27;home&#x27;.

He conducted a preaching tour in Ireland in the 1830s - not in English, but to Irish-speaking districts using his own Gaelic. In conjunction with Ppresbyterians in Belfast he made a translation into Irish of the metrical psalms, although it has to be said the text is an odd hybrid of Scottish Gaelic and Irish.

Along with the Rev Prof Daniel Dewar he produced a Gaelic-English/English-Gaelic dictionary in 1831, reprinted 13 times between then and 1910.

Shortly after his death, a collection of his Gaelic prose writings was edited by his son in law, Archibald Clerk, with a biographical sketch by Norman MacLeod jnr., first published as &quot;Caraid nan Gaidheal&quot; in 1867, reprinted in 1899 and 1910. A second collection was issued in 1901. Other writings include two Gaelic sermons, one on the outbreak of cholera in Glasgow in 1832.

MacLeod used his influence to secure Government aid for the Gaels during the potato famines of 1836-37 and 1847, earning the soubriquet, &#x27;Caraid nan Gàidheal&#x27; (Friend of the Gael). A speech delivered in the Egyptian Room of the Mansion House, London, resulted in John Dunmore Lang, a Presbyterian minister in Australia, putting in place opportunities for Gaels to emigrate to Australia.

==Family==
He married Agnes Maxwell of Aros; they had five sons and six daughters. 
The two elder sons, Norman Macleod (1812–1872) and Donald became ministers of the Church of Scotland.
Their third son, Sir George Husband Baird MacLeod was a surgeon.

MacLeod is sometimes confused with his son, also Rev. Dr. Norman MacLeod, 1812–72, also a Moderator of the General Assembly (in 1869), and author of Morvern, a Highland Parish (first published 1867) and of the song &quot;Farewell to Fiunary&quot;.

A statue was erected to Norman jnr. Cathedral Square, Glasgow showing him in the court dress of Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, over which he wears the Geneva gown of a Minister of that Church, with the hood of a Doctor of Divinity. He sports the badge of Dean of the Thistle. He is brandishing a Bible and raising his hand in preaching. He can also be seen, this time greeting Queen Victoria, in a relief on her statue in George Square on the occasion of her visit to the Cathedral. The location is significant as it is next to the old Barony Church, of which his son, also Norman was minister from 1851. His greatest renown is for his tireless work on behalf of the huge population of what was then perhaps the poorest slum parish in the city, promoting education and welfare schemes, building schools and mission churches, a penny savings bank, and temperance refreshment rooms.

<text>Hector Macneill (22 October 1746 – 15 March 1818) was a Scottish poet born near Roslin, Midlothian, Scotland. Macneill had been the son of a poor army captain and went to work as a clerk in 1760 at the age of fourteen. Soon, he was sent to the West Indies and served as assistant secretary from 1780 to 1786.

After he returned to Scotland, he wrote various political pamphlets, two novels, and several poems, &quot;The Harp&quot; (1789), &quot;The Carse of Forth&quot;, and &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Skaith&quot;, the last against drunkenness, but is best known for his songs, such as &quot;My Love&#x27;s in Germany&quot; (&quot;My Luve&#x27;s in Germanie&quot;) &quot;My Boy Tammy&quot;, &quot;I lo&#x27;ed ne&#x27;er a Laddie but ane&quot;, and &quot;Come under my Plaidie&quot;.

Hector Macneill died in Edinburgh in 1818.

==Hector&#x27;s Profile==
Hector&#x27;s Profile from &quot;The Modern Scottish Minstrel&quot; (1855) by Charles Rogers.

===Early life===
Hector Macneill was born on 22 October 1746, in the villa of Rosebank, near Roslin. His father had obtained a company in the 42nd Regiment, with which he served in Flanders. Retiring with his wife and two children to Rosebank, a few years after the birth of his son Hector, he moved to a farm on the banks of Loch Lomond.

In his eleventh year Hector wrote a drama, after the manner of John Gay; and David Doig of the grammar-school of Stirling, advised his father to educate him for a liberal profession. But the family could not afford this.

===West Indies===
A rich relative, a West India trader of Bristol, paid the captain a visit; and offered to retain Macneill in his employment. After two years&#x27; preparatory education, he was sent to Bristol at age 13. He sailed to island of Saint Kitts, provided with recommendatory letters, if he preferred employment on land. With a son of the Bristol trader he remained for a year; and then sailed for Guadeloupe, where he continued in the employment of a merchant for three years, till 1763, when the island was ceded to the French.

Dismissed by his employer, Macneill made his way to Antigua; and became assistant to his relative, who had come to the town of St John&#x27;s. He knew some French language; and became assistant to the Provost-Marshal of Grenada. This appointment he held for three years, when, hearing of the death of his mother and sister, he returned to Britain. On the death of his father, eighteen months after his arrival, he succeeded to a small patrimony, which he proceeded to invest in the purchase of an annuity of £80 per annum. With this limited income, he seems to have planned a permanent settlement in his native country; but the unexpected embarrassment of the party from whom he had purchased the annuity, and an attachment of an unfortunate nature, compelled him to re-embark on the ocean of adventure. He accepted the office of assistant-secretary on board Admiral Geary&#x27;s flagship, and made two cruises with the grand fleet. Proposing again to return to Scotland, he afterwards resigned his appointment; but he was induced, by the remonstrances of his friends, Dr Currie, and Mr Roscoe, of Liverpool, to accept a similar situation on board the flagship of Sir Richard Bickerton, who had been appointed to take the chief command of the naval power in India. In this post, many of the hardships incident to a seafaring life fell to his share; and being present at the last indecisive action with &quot;Suffrein,&quot; he had likewise to encounter the perils of war. His present connexion subsisted three years; but Macneill sickened in the discharge of duties wholly unsuitable for him, and longed for the comforts of home. His resources were still limited, but he flattered himself in the expectation that he might earn a subsistence as a man of letters. He fixed his residence at a farm-house in the vicinity of Stirling; and, amidst the pursuits of literature, the composition of verses, and the cultivation of friendship, he contrived, for a time, to enjoy a considerable share of happiness. But he speedily discovered the delusion of supposing that an individual, entirely unknown in the literary world, could at once be able to establish his reputation, and inspire confidence in the bookselling trade, whose favour is so essential to men of letters. Discouraged in longer persevering in the attempt of procuring a livelihood at home, Macneill, for the fourth time, took his departure from Britain. Provided with letters of introduction to influential and wealthy persons in Jamaica, he sailed for that island on a voyage of adventure; being now in his thirty-eighth year, and nearly as unprovided for as when he had first left his native shores, twenty-four years before. On his arrival at Kingston, he was employed by the collector of customs, whose acquaintance he had formed on the voyage; but this official soon found he could dispense with his services, which he did, without aiding him in obtaining another situation. The individuals to whom he had brought letters were unable or unwilling to render him assistance, and the unfortunate adventurer was constrained, in his emergency, to accept the kind invitation of a medical friend, to make his quarters with him till some satisfactory employment might occur. He now discovered two intimate companions of his boyhood settled in the island, in very prosperous circumstances, and from these he received both pecuniary aid and the promise of future support. Through their friendly offices, his two sons, who had been sent out by a generous friend, were placed in situations of respectability and emolument. But the thoughts of the poet himself were directed towards Britain. He sailed from Jamaica, with a thousand plans and schemes hovering in his mind, equally vague and indefinite as had been his aims and designs during the past chapter of his history. A small sum given him as the pay of an inland ensigncy, now conferred on him, but antedated, sufficed to defray the expenses of the voyage.

===Jamaica===
Before leaving Scotland for Jamaica, Macneill had commenced a poem, founded on a Highland tradition; and to the completion of this production he assiduously devoted himself during his homeward voyage. It was published at Edinburgh in 1789, under the title of &quot;The Harp, a Legendary Tale.&quot; In the previous year, he published a pamphlet in vindication of slavery, entitled, &quot;On the Treatment of the Negroes in Jamaica.&quot; This pamphlet, written to gratify the wishes of an interested friend, rather than as the result of his own convictions, he subsequently endeavoured to suppress. For several years, Macneill persevered in his unsettled mode of life. On his return from Jamaica, he resided in the mansion of his friend, Mr Graham of Gartmore, himself a writer of verses, as well as a patron of letters; but a difference with the family caused him to quit this hospitable residence. After passing some time with his relatives in Argyllshire, he entertained a proposal of establishing himself in Glasgow, as partner of a mercantile house, but this was terminated by the dissolution of the firm; and a second attempt to succeed in the republic of letters had an equally unsuccessful issue. In Edinburgh, whither he had removed, he was seized with a severe nervous illness, which, during the six following years, rendered him incapable of sustained physical exertion. With a little money, which he contrived to raise on his annuity, he retired to a small cottage at St Ninians; but his finances again becoming reduced, he accepted of the hospitable invitation of his friends, Major Spark and his lady, to become the inmate of their residence of Viewforth House, Stirling. At this period, Macneill composed the greater number of his best songs, and produced his poem of &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Skaith, or the History of Will and Jean,&quot; which was published in 1795, and speedily gained him a wide reputation. Before the close of twelvemonths, it passed through no fewer than fourteen editions. A sequel, entitled &quot;The Waes o&#x27; War,&quot; which appeared in 1796, attained nearly an equal popularity. The original ballad was composed during the author&#x27;s solitary walks along the promenades of the King&#x27;s Park, Stirling, while he was still suffering mental depression. It was completed in his own mind before any of the stanzas were committed to paper.

The hope of benefiting his enfeebled constitution in a warm climate induced him to revisit Jamaica. As a parting tribute to his friends at Stirling, he published, in 1799, immediately before his departure, a descriptive poem, entitled &quot;The Links of Forth, or a Parting Peep at the Carse of Stirling,&quot; which, regarded as the last effort of a dying poet, obtained a reception fully equal to its merits.

On the oft-disappointed and long unfortunate poet the sun of prosperity at length arose. On his arrival in Jamaica, one of his early friends, Mr John Graham, of Three-Mile-River, settled on him an annuity of £100 a-year; and, in a few months afterwards, they sailed together for Britain, the poet&#x27;s health being essentially improved. Macneill now fixed his permanent residence in Edinburgh, and, with the proceeds of several legacies bequeathed to him, together with his annuity, was enabled to live in comparative affluence. The narrative of his early adventures and hardships is supposed to form the basis of a novel, entitled &quot;The Memoirs of Charles Macpherson, Esq.,&quot; which proceeded from his pen in 1800. In the following year, he published a complete edition of his poetical works, in two duodecimo volumes. In 1809, he published &quot;The Pastoral, or Lyric Muse of Scotland,&quot; in a thin quarto volume; and about the same time, anonymously, two other works in verse, entitled &quot;Town Fashions, or Modern Manners Delineated,&quot; and &quot;Bygone Times and Late-come Changes.&quot; His last work, &quot;The Scottish Adventurers,&quot; a novel, appeared in 1812, in two octavo volumes.

===Later works===
Macneill wrote songs, &quot;Mary of Castlecary,&quot; &quot;My boy, Tammie,&quot; &quot;Come under my plaidie,&quot; &quot;I lo&#x27;ed ne&#x27;er a laddie but ane,&quot; &quot;Donald and Flora,&quot; and &quot;Dinna think, bonnie lassie,&quot; that were popular. The ballad of &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Skaith&quot; aimed at realism on rural life, and a temperance message.

===Later life and death===
During his latter years, Macneill was known in fashionable company in Edinburgh, as a conversationalist. He died on 15 March 1818, at age 71.

<text>William Maginn (10 July 1794 – 21 August 1842) was an Irish journalist and writer.

==About==
Born at Cork he became a contributor to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, and after moving to London in 1824 became for a few months in 1826 the Paris correspondent to &quot;The Representative&quot;, a paper started by John Murray, the publisher. When its short career was run, he helped to found in 1827 the ultra Tory &quot;Standard,&quot; a newspaper that he edited along with a fellow graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, Stanley Lees Giffard; he also wrote for the more scandalous Sunday paper, &quot;The Age&quot;. In 1830 he instigated and became one of the leading supporters of &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. His &quot;Homeric Ballads&quot;, much praised by contemporary critics, were published in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s&quot; between 1839 and 1842. In 1837, &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; was launched, with Charles Dickens as editor, and Maginn wrote the prologue and contributed over the next several years a series of &quot;Shakespeare Papers&quot; that examined characters in counter-intuitive fashion (e.g., the key to Falstaff is his melancholy). From &quot;The Man in the Bell&quot; (&quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, 1821) through &quot;Welch Rabbits&quot; (&quot;Bentley&#x27;s&quot;, 1842) he was an occasional though skilful writer of short fiction and tales. His only novel, &quot;Whitehall&quot; (1827) pretends to be an historical novel set in 1820s England written in the year 2227; it is a droll spoof of the vogue for historical novels as well as the contemporary political scene. He also wrote &quot;The Military Sketch-Book: Reminiscences of Seventeen Years Service Abroad and At Home&quot;, &quot;By An Officer of the Line&quot; (anonymously) published in two volumes by Henry Colburn in 1827. Partly set in Australia and involving the capture of a notorious gang of Bushrangers. In 1836, he fought a duel with Grantley Berkeley, a member of Parliament. Three rounds of shots were fired, but no one was struck. Berkeley had brutally assaulted magazine publisher James Fraser over a review Maginn wrote of Berkeley&#x27;s novel &quot;Berkeley Castle&quot;, and Maginn had called him out.

One of the most brilliant periodical writers of his time, Maginn left little permanent work behind him. In his later years, 1842, his intemperate habits landed him in debtor&#x27;s prison, and when he emerged through the grace of the Insolvent Debtor&#x27;s Act he was in an advanced stage of tuberculosis. He wrote until the end, including in the first volume of &quot;Punch&quot;, but he died in extreme poverty in Walton-on-Thames in August 1842, survived by his wife Ellen, and daughters Annie and Ellen, and son John. His nephew Francis Maginn, who was deaf, was a co-founder of the British Deaf and Dumb Association, now called the British Deaf Association (BDA).

<text>Francis Sylvester Mahony (31 December 1804 – 18 May 1866), also known by the pen name Father Prout, was an Irish humorist and journalist.

==Life==
He was born in Cork, Ireland, to Martin Mahony and Mary Reynolds. He was educated at the Jesuit Clongowes Wood College, Kildare, and later in the College of Saint-Acheul, a similar school in Amiens, France and then at Rue de Sèvres, Paris, and later in Rome. He began teaching at the Jesuit school of Clongowes as master of rhetoric, but was soon after expelled. He then went to London, and became a leading contributor to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, under the signature of &quot;Father Prout&quot; (the original Father Prout, whom Mahony knew in his youth, born in 1757, was parish priest of Watergrasshill, County Cork). Mahony at one point was director of this magazine.

He was witty and learned in many languages. One form which his humour took was the professed discovery of the originals in Latin, Greek, or mediaeval French of popular modern poems and songs. Many of these &quot;jeux d&#x27;esprit&quot; were collected as &quot;Reliques of Father Prout&quot;. He pretended that these poems had been found in Fr. Prout&#x27;s trunk after his death. He wittily described himself as &quot;an Irish potato seasoned with Attic salt.&quot; Later he acted as foreign correspondent to various newspapers, and during the last eight years of his life, his articles formed a main attraction of &quot;The Globe&quot;.

Mahony spent the last two years of his life in a monastery and died in Paris reconciled to the Church.

== &quot;The Bells of Shandon&quot; ==
In his native Cork Mahoney is best remembered for his poem &quot;The Bells of Shandon&quot; and his pen-name is synonymous with the city and the church of St. Anne&#x27;s, Shandon.

==Publications==
The &quot;Reliques of Father Prout&quot; originally appeared in two volumes in 1836 with illustrations by Maclise. They were reissued in Bohn&#x27;s Illustrated Library in 1860. Another volume, &quot;Final Reliques&quot;, was edited by Douglas Jerrold and published in 1876. &quot;The Works of Father Prout&quot;, edited by Charles Kent, was published in 1881. &quot;Facts and Figures from Italy&quot; (1847) was made from his Rome letters to the London &quot;Daily News&quot;.

==Graham Greene reference==

The protagonist of Graham Greene&#x27;s &quot; Travels With My Aunt&quot; mentions regretfully his life&#x27;s unfulfilled ambition &quot;to be recognised as an English Mahony and celebrate Southwood as he celebrated Shandon&quot;

<doc id="1095890" wikidata="Q4923558" url="?curid=1095890" title="Norodom Chakrapong">
<text>Norodom Chakrapong (born 21 October 1945) is a Cambodian politician, businessman and former major-general of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces. He is the fourth son of Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia and also a half-brother of the current king, Norodom Sihamoni. Chakrapong started his career as a military pilot in 1963. After Sihanouk was overthrown in 1970, Chakrapong spent time under house arrest, then in Beijing as the Head of Protocol of then-Prince Sihanouk, afterwards living overseas before he joined the Funcinpec in 1981 and fought against Vietnamese occupation as a commander of the Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste. In 1991, Chakrapong left Funcinpec to join the Cambodian People&#x27;s Party (CPP) and served as the Deputy Prime Minister of Cambodia between 1992 and 1993. When the CPP lost the 1993 general elections, Chakrapong led a secession attempt in 1993. In 1994, he was accused of joining a failed coup attempt (which he denied) which led him to be sent into exile. After Chakrapong was pardoned in 1998, he founded a private airline company, Royal Phnom Penh Airways. The airlines later stopped all operations in early 2006.

In 2002, Chakrapong established a royalist party, the Khmer Soul Party. When the Khmer Soul Party failed to win a single parliamentary seat in the 2003 general elections, Charkapong rejoined Funcinpec and briefly served as Senator in 2005. In 2006, Chakrapong was expelled from Funcinpec and joined the Norodom Ranariddh Party. When the Cambodian government pursued legal investigations on the debts Chakrapong accumulated from his airlines, Chakrapong quit politics in 2007. Chakrapong, who was already a privy councillor to the Supreme Privy Council, then dedicated himself to humanitarian work and supporting royal activities. In 2013, Chakrapong was appointed member of the Constitutional Council of Cambodia by the King.

==Early life==

Norodom Chakrapong was born at the Khemarin Palace in Phnom Penh, Cambodia to Norodom Sihanouk and Sisowath Pongsanmoni. As a young boy, Chakrapong was trained as a ballet dancer at the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and performed at several state functions when Sihanouk attended or hosted foreign dignitaries when he was Prime Minister. In 1958, Chakrapong was sent with his half-brother Ranariddh to Marseille, France, where they attended high school. After graduating in 1963, Chakrapong returned to Cambodia and became an officer cadet with the Royal Cambodian Air Force where he graduated at the top of his class. After completing his cadet course, Chakrapong was sent back to France for a year where he received extensive training in flying MiG-21 jets. He returned in 1967 and was later commissioned as a lieutenant. When Lon Nol launched a coup against Sihanouk in March 1970, Chakrapong was arrested and kept under house arrest until November 1973. After his release, Chakrapong went to Beijing, China, where he joined his father and served as his father&#x27;s Chief of Protocol between 1973 and 1975. In 1975, Chakrapong travelled to Yugoslavia at the invitation of Josip Broz Tito. He spent a year at the Yugoslav Air Force Staff College, before he moved to France with his family as political refugees in 1976. Chakrapong settled in Créteil until 1981. During this time, Chakrapong ran a small enterprise to provide a source of income for his family.

==Political career==

===First time in Funcinpec===

Chakrapong joined Sihanouk in helping to form the Funcinpec in March 1981. He was appointed a commander of the Armee Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS, informally known as the Funcinpec army). The following year, Chakrapong was made GCKD Minister of Health and Social Affairs for the party, a position that he held until 1984. In March 1985, Chakrapong became the deputy Chief of Staff of ANS. During this time, Chakrapong defended ANS military bases against Vietnamese incursions. In 1989, Ranariddh made Chakrapong to represent Funcinpec in negotiations leading to the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Chakrapong was against the decision to co-opt the Khmer Rouge into playing any role in future Cambodian governments, a stand that came into conflict with Ranariddh and other senior Funcinpec leaders. Chakrapong was a leading figure of the guerilla war against the Vietnamese occupation, spending most of the time in the jungle at the Cambodia-Thailand border.

===Cambodia People&#x27;s Party, secession and coup attempt===

In late 1991, Chakrapong quit Funcinpec to join the CPP at Hun Sen&#x27;s invitation. He was given a seat in the party&#x27;s politburo, and in January 1992 Chakrapong was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in charge of civil aviation, tourism, industry, culture, education, and social welfare affairs. Shortly after he was appointed to the post, Chakrapong was appointed director of Kampuchea Airlines. He also encouraged foreign investment in Cambodia and provided support to investors that established financial institutions and enterprises in the country.

When the 1993 general elections were held, Chakrapong campaigned for a Presidential system of government for Cambodia with Sihanouk as president. On 10 June, Chakrapong led a few senior CPP allies, including Sin Song and Bou Thang, to declare the secession of seven eastern Cambodian provinces bordering Vietnam from control by the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC). The region was renamed the &quot;Samdech Euv Autonomous Zone&quot;. UNTAC staff personnel were ordered to leave, and Chakrapong issued orders to soldiers under his command to ransack UNTAC and Funcinpec offices in these provinces. Three days later, Ranariddh returned to Cambodia to preside over an emergency parliamentary meeting to reinstate Sihanouk as the country&#x27;s Head of State. At the same time, Tea Banh issued a directive to the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces to restore order in the seven eastern provinces. When Chakrapong received news of these developments, he fled across the border to Vietnam on 15 June. Sihanouk made a formal request for Chakrapong to drop his secessionist movement and return to Phnom Penh. Chakrapong obeyed his father&#x27;s request to return and was awarded the military rank of Major-General for the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces.

After a permanent government was formed in September 1993, Chakrapong and Sin Song appealed to the CPP politburo to be reinstated as Members of Parliament. The CPP made several motions for this purpose, but faced strong opposition from Funcinpec members of parliament under Ranariddh&#x27;s instructions. In May 1994, the CPP was able to secure support from Funcinpec to outlaw the Khmer Rouge in exchange for an agreement not to pursue any further motions to reinstate Chakrapong and Sin Song as Members of Parliament. In July, Chakrapong was accused of participating to a failed coup attempt by Gen. Sin Song. He has always denied his involvement.

Hun Sen ordered soldiers to arrest Sin Song, Sin Sen, and Chakrapong. When Chakrapong heard that Sin Song was arrested, he became worried for his life and safety, and sought refuge at Regent Hotel in Phnom Penh on 3 July. Chakrapong called American journalist Nate Thayer for help, who assisted him to negotiate with government ministers and diplomats for safe passage out of Cambodia. Thayer had initially to sought asylum in the United States but was unsuccessful in contacting US Ambassador Charles Twining. After several hours of negotiations, the government allowed Chakrapong to leave Cambodia for Malaysia. Chakrapong issued a statement to deny his involvement in the coup attempt, and sent a letter to then-Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim for long-term asylum in Malaysia. Anwar turned down Chakrapong&#x27;s request after Ranariddh expressed disapproval, and Chakrapong subsequently sought long-term refuge in France where he was to stay for the next four years.

===Subsequent political career===
Chakrapong received a royal pardon from Sihanouk in November 1998 and returned to Cambodia in early 1999. He subsequently rejoined Funcinpec as an ordinary member in March 1999 at Ranariddh&#x27;s invitation. Chakrapong abstained from playing an active role in the party to avoid renewing tensions with his brother, and focused on his business career. In April 2001, Chakrapong shared the idea of forming a new party with Funcinpec party members. In May 2002, Chakrapong launched the Khmer Soul Party. After the Khmer Soul Party failed to win any seats in the 2003 general elections, Chakrapong dissolved the party and returned to Funcinpec in March 2004. In May 2005, Chakrapong was appointed to the newly minted party post of general-inspector. In January 2006, Chakrapong was elected senator for Prey Veng Province. Two months later, Ranariddh appointed him secretary-general, but faced opposition from some senior party members such as Nhek Bun Chhay and Lu Laysreng. Within a week of Chakrapong&#x27;s nomination, the finance ministry issued a bill calling for him to pay up due taxes from a failed airline business venture, prompting Chakrapong to withdraw from the secretary-general post.

In May 2006, an anonymous letter from the Ministry of Information was circulated within the party, stating Ranariddh&#x27;s purported intention to form a new royalist party. Nhek Bun Chhay followed the issue closely and provided a list of party members who were planning to defect from Funcinpec, which included Serey Kosal and Chakrapong. At the same time, Nhek Bun Chhay appointed Nouv Sovathero party spokesman, while re-designating the then-incumbent party spokesman Chea Chanboribo the personal spokesman for Ranariddh. The cascade of incidents from Nhek Bun Chhay stoked anger from Serey Kosal and Chakrapong who threatened to sue him. When Ranariddh was fired from his position as the president of Funcinpec in October 2006, Chakrapong was also expelled from the party and senate the following month.

Within days after his expulsion, Chakrapong joined Ranariddh to form the Norodom Ranariddh Party (NRP), and was in turn appointed the party&#x27;s vice president. Ranariddh had been issued two lawsuits over embezzlement of property and adultery, and Chakrapong publicly defended Ranariddh, saying that the lawsuits were politically motivated. After Ranariddh sought exile in Malaysia in March 2007 following his conviction over his embezzlement charges, Chakrapong served as the party&#x27;s acting president. In the same month, Hun Sen reopened the case on Chakrapong&#x27;s debts and filed legal charges against him. When the commune elections were held in April 2007, Chakrapong led the NRP to secure 472 out of 11,459 commune councilor seats available. Following the commune elections, Chakrapong resigned from the NRP in June 2007.

==Business career==
In October 1999, Chakrapong founded Royal Phnom Penh Airways. Chakrapong raised US$2 million from personal savings and bank loans, which he used to acquire one 52-seater Antonov-24 and another 100-seater Yakovlev Yak-42 airplanes. The airlines flew domestic routes within the first year of operations and most of its customers were Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese tourists. By May 2001, Royal Phnom Penh Airways secured three authorizations to fly between Phnom Penh–Bangkok, Phnom Penh–Ho Chi Minh City as well as Ho Chi Minh City–Siem Reap. The airlines attempted to secure two additional routes from the Cambodian government—Bangkok-Siem Reap in August 2001 and Siem Reap-Bangkok in August 2002—but lost both bids to other airlines. Chakrapong accused the government political bias in awarding the deals due to his political affiliations. In October 2003, the director of Battambang Airport, Prum Chantha, reported that Royal Phnom Penh Airways had accumulated $1 million in unpaid taxes. Chakrapong suspended domestic flights between Phnom Penh and Battambang as foreign tourists opted for land transport options to provincial capitals which were cheaper than air transport. Royal Phnom Penh Airways had already become bankrupt by March 2006 when the government presented Chakrapong a bill of $1.36 million in unpaid taxes, navigation, and landing fees. When Chakrapong failed to repay the taxes to the government, Hun Sen issued a lawsuit in March 2007 against him.

==Palace relations==

===Awards and appointments===

Chakrapong was bestowed the title of &quot;Sdech Krom Khun&quot; in February 1994, which translates as &quot;The Great Prince&quot;. Chakrapong was given the royal title of &quot;Samdech Preah Mohessara&quot; in August 2004 by Sihanouk shortly before the latter handed over the throne to Sihamoni. Chakrapong was appointed as a privy councilor of the Supreme Privy Council of Cambodia with the rank equivalent to Deputy Prime Minister. He also established a foundation named after his older brother, the Norodom Racvivong Foundation, to support charitable and humanitarian initiatives for the poor. In 2013, Prince Chakrapong was appointed member of the Constitutional Council, as one of the three members representing the King (out of 9 members).

===Succession debates to the throne===

In the 1990s, a public debate on ensued in Cambodia over the succession to the royal throne after Sihanouk was diagnosed with multiple health problems. Unlike Ranariddh or Sihamoni, Chakrapong was not a popular candidate, and a poll in 1995 by the Khmer Journalists&#x27; Association showed that only 6% out of 700 respondents supported Chakrapong&#x27;s candidacy to the throne. Julio Jeldres, Sihanouk&#x27;s official biographer, expressed in 1999 that Chakrapong had little chance of becoming the next king due to his alleged involvement in the 1994 coup attempt. In August 2002, Chakrapong raised the idea of holding national elections to choose a successor, and expressed concern over political interference in the Cambodian throne council. Chakrapong&#x27;s proposal had the support of Jeldres and Son Chhay, an opposition member of parliament who expressed similar concerns, but was opposed by Hun Sen.

==Family==

Chakrapong&#x27;s mother, Sisowath Pongsanmoni, was the younger half-sister of Sisowath Kossamak. Kossamak is the mother of Sihanouk, and both Pongsanmoni and Kossamak had the same father, Sisowath Monivong. Pongsanmoni died in 1974. Chakrapong has six full siblings, consisting of three brothers (Yuvaneath, Racvivong and Khemanourak) and three younger sisters (Sorya Roeungsi, Kantha Bopha and Botum Bopha). Khemanourak, Sorya Roeungsi and Botum Bopha were killed by the Khmer Rouge, while Racvivong and Kantha Bopha died young of illness. Yuvaneath is Chakrapong&#x27;s sole surviving full sibling, and Chakrapong has six other half-siblings by Sihanouk&#x27;s unions with different wives.

Chakrapong has had seven wives and has thirteen children. Chakrapong past wives include: Hun Soeun, Kethy Tioulong, the daughter of Nhiek Tioulong; Duong Diyath. Duong Yany, Charuvan Duongchan (a Thai national), and Moniren. Following his separation from Moniren, Chakrapong took Princess Norodom Kachanipha Chakrapong as his wife and she remains his spouse until today.

<text>&quot;Who Mourns for Adonais?&quot; is the second episode of the second season of the American science fiction television series &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Written by Gilbert Ralston and Gene L. Coon, and directed by Marc Daniels, it was first broadcast September 22, 1967.

The title is in line 415 of the 1821 elegy &quot;Adonais&quot; by Percy Bysshe Shelley and roughly means &quot;who mourns for gods?&quot;

In the episode, the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; are held captive by the Greek god Apollo.

==Plot==
A huge energy field in the shape of a glowing green hand appears and grabs the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;, halting its movement. Captain James T. Kirk tries to shake the ship free, but fails. A humanoid apparition appears on the bridge viewscreen and addresses the ship&#x27;s crew. Kirk demands that the ship be set free, but the being responds by tightening its grip, threatening to crush the ship until Kirk agrees to the being&#x27;s demand that the ship&#x27;s crew be beamed down to the planet below.

Kirk leads a landing party that includes Lieutenant Carolyn Palamas (Leslie Parrish), whose specialties include Greek mythology. The team arrives at what appears to be an ancient Greek temple, where they encounter the humanoid who identifies himself as the god Apollo (Michael Forest). He informs the party that he will not allow them to leave, and renders their communicators and transporter nonfunctional. He indicates that he expects the crew of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; to worship him as their ancestors did, and in return promises to provide for all their needs and desires. Kirk refuses.

Apollo&#x27;s attention shifts to Carolyn, angering Mr. Scott, who steps forward to defend her against Apollo&#x27;s advances. Apollo destroys his phaser and announces he will take Carolyn as his consort. After displaying his power, Apollo appears tired, and vanishes along with Carolyn.

Kirk and McCoy speculate that their captor was one of a group of powerful aliens that visited Earth millennia ago and became objects of worship to the ancient Greeks. Chekov having noticed Apollo&#x27;s fatigue, Kirk plans to provoke Apollo to test the limits of his power and allow the landing party to overcome him. Meanwhile, Carolyn learns that Apollo belonged to a group of travelers who subsist on love and worship. He is the last of their kind, the others having died over the eons.

Kirk&#x27;s plan to provoke Apollo is frustrated when Carolyn intervenes to protect the landing party. Apollo instructs Kirk to begin making arrangements for the remaining crew to come down to the planet. Kirk takes Carolyn aside and tells her that she must reject Apollo to save them all from slavery. She reluctantly agrees.

Meanwhile, Mr. Spock locates the power source for the force field holding the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and finds a way to communicate and fire phasers through it. Forced to prioritize responsibility over romantic desire, a broken-hearted Carolyn lies through her teeth and tells Apollo her interest in him is purely scientific, likening him to a new strain of bacteria. His feelings hurt, Apollo invokes a thunderstorm while Kirk orders Spock to fire on and destroy the power source.

Defeated, Apollo addresses his fellow gods, admitting that he was wrong, and begging to join them. He fades away. Carolyn is distraught. Kirk notes that humans owe their moral code to the Greek civilisation and mythology, and (along with McCoy) regrets having to destroy Apollo.

==Reception==
Zack Handlen of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the episode a C+ rating, noting that it was occasionally memorable, but &quot;undone by lazy scripting and bizarre dialogue&quot;.

In 2024 &quot;Hollywood.com&quot; ranked this episode at number 37 out of the 79 original series episodes.

==Cultural references==
The title is a quotation from the poem &quot;Adonais&quot; by Percy Shelley lamenting the death of John Keats, which is loosely based upon &quot;A Lament for Adonis&quot; by the Greek poet Bion.

The song &quot;Who Mourns for Adonais&quot; was recorded by The Vulcan Dub Squad

Two of Maitland&#x27;s manuscript works survive; both are compilations of the Scots literature of his era. They preserve many of the works of the great makars and a large number of anonymous pieces. The manuscripts also record many of Maitland&#x27;s own compositions. Maitland&#x27;s daughter Marie transcribed his poems as well as her brother John Maitland&#x27;s and others.

The Maitland Manuscripts are held by the Pepys Library.

==Relations==
Maitland is the 12th great grandfather of preminent Canadian sculptor and poet Christian Cardell Corbet.

<doc id="1095898" wikidata="Q1700959" url="?curid=1095898" title="John Malcolm">
<text>Major-General Sir John Malcolm GCB, KLS (2 May 1769 – 30 May 1833) was a Scottish soldier, diplomat, East India Company administrator, statesman, and historian.

==Early life==
Sir John Malcolm was born in 1769, one of seventeen children of George Malcolm, an impoverished tenant farmer in Eskdale in the Scottish Border country, and his wife Margaret (&#x27;Bonnie Peggy&#x27;), née Pasley, the sister of Admiral Sir Thomas Pasley. His brothers included Sir James Malcolm, Admiral Sir Pulteney Malcolm and Sir Charles Malcolm. He left school, family and country at the age of thirteen, and achieved distinction in the East India Company, where he was nicknamed &#x27;Boy Malcolm&#x27;.

==Career==
Arriving at Madras in 1783 as an ensign in the East India Company&#x27;s Madras Army, he served as a regimental soldier for eleven years, before spending a year in Britain to restore his health. He returned to India in 1795 as Military Secretary to General Sir Alured Clarke, participating en route in Clarke&#x27;s capture of the Cape of Good Hope.
In the Anglo-Mysore wars of 1799 he served with the Hyderabad contingent, and later as joint secretary of the Peace Commission setting up the new government of Mysore. Later that year he was selected by the Governor-General (Lord Mornington, later Marquess Wellesley) to lead a diplomatic mission to Iran. Following his return in 1801 he became Wellesley&#x27;s private secretary, based in Calcutta (Kolkata).

In the Anglo-Maratha war of 1803–05, he accompanied Sir Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington) as the Governor-General&#x27;s representative and diplomatic agent; the two men forming a lifelong friendship. In 1804, he was appointed British Resident at Mysore, but in 1805-6 saw further service in north India with General Lake.

In early 1808, the Governor-General, Lord Minto, sent him on a second mission to Iran, but at this time French influence was dominant in Tehran, and he was rebuffed. Later that year a separate mission from London under Sir Harford Jones arrived in Iran and achieved success, the Iran government having by then become disenchanted with the French. Malcolm was again sent to Iran in 1810, but by that time the British government had decided to conduct diplomatic relations with Iran directly from London, and appointed Sir Gore Ouseley as ambassador.

In 1812, Malcolm returned to Britain for five years&#x27; furlough, and spent much of his time as a writer, completing his &quot;History of Iran&quot; (the first in English derived directly from Iran sources) in 1815. For this he received an honorary DCL from the University of Oxford. Returning to India in 1817, he acted as the Governor-General&#x27;s agent in negotiations leading up to the third (and last) Anglo-Maratha war. He also acted as a general, leading Company troops to victory against Maharajah Malhar Rao Holkar II at the decisive Battle of Mahidpur (Mehidpoor) on 21 December 1817. In January 1818, Malcolm was placed by the Marquess of Hastings in the military and political charge of Central India (roughly, today&#x27;s Madhya Pradesh); during the four years he filled that station, his attention was directed to the object of collecting materials for the illustration of its past and present condition. The report hereof he sent to Calcutta, where it was printed by order of Government. Disappointed to being superseded for the governorship of Bombay and Madras by his juniors, Malcolm left for Britain in 1822, where he lived with his family as a country gentleman, completing two more books.

In 1827 he was appointed Governor of Bombay. His governorship was generally successful, despite controversy over an unfortunate quarrel with the judges of the Bombay Supreme Court, who sought to extend their jurisdiction beyond Bombay to the Deccan hinterland, newly acquired by the company from the Maratha Peshwa of Poona. In seeking to end both sati (the self-immolation of widows on their husband&#x27;s funeral pyres) and female infanticide by moral persuasion, Malcolm visited Gujarat in February 1830 and met Sahajanand Swami, the founder of the Swaminarayan sect of Hinduism, who was advocating similar reforms. He has ever since been remembered in Swaminarayan literature. Together with his predecessor, Mountstuart Elphinstone, he was a pioneer in the promotion of Indian education and the training of Indians for the higher ranks of government. He also served as president of the Literary Society of Bombay

In 1831 Malcolm finally returned to Britain, and immediately became a Member of Parliament for the rotten borough of Launceston, supporting his friend the Duke of Wellington in opposition to the Reform Bill. He bought Warfield Hall in Berkshire from the Parry family and busied himself renovating it. His last public act was a speech in April 1833 to the Proprietors (shareholders) of the East India Company, persuading them to accept the Government&#x27;s terms for renewal of its Charter. Immediately afterwards he suffered a stroke and died on 30 May 1833. He was buried in St James&#x27;s Church, Piccadilly.

There is a marble statue of Malcolm, by Francis Chantrey, in the north transept of Westminster Abbey. There is also a statue of him in the town hall at Bombay and a 100-foot-high obelisk celebrating his achievements on Whita Hill, above Langholm in Scotland.
==Family==
In 1807 he married (in Mysore) Isabella Charlotte, the second daughter of General Sir Alexander Campbell. She bore five children, including George Alexander Malcolm.

==Legacy==
Together with his contemporaries Mountstuart Elphinstone and Sir Thomas Munro, Malcolm was an architect of three early principles of British rule, whose wisdom &quot;was too soon forgotten and remembered too late&quot;.
Four main themes can be identified. Firstly, India was to be ruled for the benefit of the company – but also of Indians, i.e. no British settlers. 
Secondly, indirect rule was to be preferred, leaving existing Indian rulers in place wherever possible, with minimal disturbance of traditional methods of governance, religion and social structure.
Thirdly, Malcolm helped to develop the role of the District Officer, a small group of powerful administrators with minimal overt force to support them.
Fourthly, Malcolm promoted a &#x27;forward&#x27; foreign policy; meaning diplomatic engagement with neighbouring states such as Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia.

He was a mentor and inspiration to several celebrated Anglo-Indian statesmen – among them Henry Pottinger, Charles Metcalfe, Alexander Burnes and Henry Rawlinson

==Literary works==

Malcolm wrote nine books, plus a volume of poetry, as follows:
* &quot;Sketch of the Sikhs&quot; (1812)
* &quot;Sketch of the Political History of India&quot; (1811)
* &quot;Disturbances in the Madras Army in 1809&quot; (1812)
* &quot;The History of Persia&quot; (1815)
* &quot;A Memoir of Central India&quot; (1823)
* &quot;The Political History of India&quot; (1826)
* &quot;Sketches of Persia&quot; (1827) – this book is not written by Malcolm, but by one of his companions in his mission to Iran; the writer remains anonymous and has introduced himself as the traveller; he has referred to Malcolm in his text as , which is a Persian word meaning envoy of a foreign country
* &quot;The Government of India&quot; (1833)
* &quot;The Life of Robert, Lord Clive&quot; (1836; posthumous)

<text>Metavolcanic rock is volcanic rock that shows signs of having experienced metamorphism. In other words, the rock was originally produced by a volcano, either as lava or tephra. The rock was then subjected to high pressure, high temperature or both, for example by burial under younger rocks, causing the original volcanic rock to recrystallize. Metavolcanic rocks are sometimes described informally as &quot;metavolcanics&quot;.

When it is possible to determine the original volcanic rock type from the properties of the metavolcanic rock (particularly if the degree of metamorphism is slight), the rock is more precisely named by appylying the prefix &quot;meta-&quot; to the original rock type. For example, a weakly metamorphosed basalt would be described as a &quot;metabasalt&quot;, or a weakly metamorphosed tuff as a &quot;metatuff&quot;. 

Metavolcanic rock is commonly found in greenstone belts.

<text>Lorenzo Sumulong Sr. (September 5, 1905 – October 21, 1997) was a Filipino lawyer and politician who served in the Philippine Senate for four decades, and as a delegate of his country to the United Nations. He was noted for having engaged in a debate with Nikita Khrushchev at the United Nations General Assembly that (allegedly) provoked the Soviet Union Premier to bang his shoe on a desk.

==Early life and education==

Sumulong was born in Antipolo, Rizal. He finished law at the University of the Philippines College of Law and went on to top the 1929 bar examinations. In 1932, he obtained a Masters of Law degree from Harvard Law School.

==Political career==

Sumulong began his political career as a municipal councilor in Antipolo. In the 1946 general elections, Sumulong won a seat in the House of Representatives, representing the 2nd District of Rizal. In 1949, Sumulong was elected to the Philippine Senate. He won re-election to the Senate in 1955 and in 1961. He did not seek re-election in 1967, but would return to the Senate in the 1969 elections. In all, Sumulong remained in Congress for 24 years, initially under the Liberal Party, but later under the Nacionalista Party. He served through the 1st Congress until the 7th Congress.
During his 21-year stint as senator, Sumulong became the chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accountability (also known as the Blue Ribbon Committee). Through that high-profile position, he investigated noted national controversies such as the Tambobong-Buenavista Estate deal and the Harry Stonehill scandals.

==Faceoff with Khrushchev==

Sumulong also served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, and in that capacity, he led a Philippine delegation to the 902nd Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in 1960. During that meeting, Sumulong took the floor and delivered the following remarks challenging the Soviet Union to allow the people of Eastern Europe the free exercise of their civil and political rights.

Khrushchev was incensed by Sumulong&#x27;s remarks. He denounced the Filipino senator as &quot;a jerk, a stooge and a lackey of imperialism&quot;. Khrushchev then took out his shoe, waved it at Sumulong, then banged the shoe on the desk in front of him. The following day, Khrushchev acknowledged that he had offended Sumulong but also asserted that he was likewise offended by the delegate from the Philippines.

==Later life==

Sumulong&#x27;s service in Congress ended in 1972, with the abolition of the Philippine Senate upon the declaration of martial law by President Ferdinand Marcos. In 1987, President Corazon Aquino named her maternal uncle Lorenzo (sister was Demetria Sumulong Cojuangco) to the Philippine Constitutional Commission of 1986 that drafted the 1987 Philippine Constitution.

Lorenzo is the father of Victor Sumulong, who served as congressman and mayor of Antipolo during the Estrada and Arroyo administrations.

==Personal life==
Sumulong was married to Estrella Rodriguez and had six children. By way of Francisco Sumulong (born 1695), Sumulong is the fifth cousin thrice removed of Senator Jose W. Diokno, a descendant of Doña Demetria Sumulong y Lindo who moved from Antipolo to Daraga, Albay and Governor-General Felix Berenguer de Marquina.

<text>Éric Serra (; born 9 September 1959) is a French film composer, known as a frequent collaborator of director Luc Besson. He is a five-time César Award nominee, winning once for &quot;The Big Blue&quot; (1988).

== Early life ==
Serra was born in Saint-Mandé in 1959. His father, Claude Serra, was a songwriter and poet during the 1950’s and ‘60s, and so Éric was thus exposed to music and its production at a young age. His mother died when he was just seven years old.

== Career ==
In the early 1980s, Éric Serra met director Luc Besson and was asked to score his first film, &quot;Le Dernier Combat&quot; (1983). Serra has scored all of Besson&#x27;s directed films to date, except &quot;Angel-A&quot; (2005) (scored by Anja Garbarek), and several that Besson has written, such as &quot;Wasabi&quot;.

In 1995, Serra was chosen to compose the score to the James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, and produced a much more modern-sounding avant-garde soundtrack than had been used in previous Bond films. It met with mixed reviews from film critics. While Serra&#x27;s score has been seen by some as highly innovative, many Bond fans have criticized it and often highlighted the lack of the classic, instantly recognizable Bond leitmotif originally created by Monty Norman and John Barry. The &quot;GoldenEye&quot; producers later hired John Altman to re-score the tank chase sequence, which incorporated a traditional arrangement of the Bond theme. David Arnold would succeed Serra as Bond composer until 2008.

Serra is sometimes known as RXRA due to the French pronunciation of his name. His composition &quot;Little Light of Love&quot; on the soundtrack of the film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; is credited to RXRA.

Serra has been the partner of Australian model Jodi Luschwitz for 17 years, with whom he has two children: Ashani and Mitivaï.

=== Other projects ===
From 1980 to 1988, Éric Serra played bass guitar for French singer Jacques Higelin.

Serra is also a songwriter, notably having written &quot;It&#x27;s Only Mystery&quot; for the film &quot;Subway&quot;, &quot;My Lady Blue&quot; for &quot;Le Grand Bleu&quot; and &quot;Little Light of Love&quot; for &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. In 1998 he released an album of rock music titled &quot;RXRA&quot; which resembles the artist&#x27;s name when pronounced as initial letters in French.

Serra composed the music for the 2008 Las Vegas Criss Angel/Cirque Du Soleil show &#x27;Criss Angel: Believe&#x27;.

=== Onscreen appearances ===
Serra has spent little time in front of the camera, choosing to work behind the scenes instead. However, on French television he has made a number of appearances performing music, and notably appeared in the Luc Besson film &quot;Subway&quot; in which he plays &#x27;Enrico the bassist&#x27;.

<doc id="1095918" wikidata="Q1385210" url="?curid=1095918" title="Extractive distillation">
<text>Extractive distillation is defined as distillation in the presence of a miscible, high-boiling, relatively non-volatile component, the solvent, that forms no azeotrope with the other components in the mixture. The method is used for mixtures having a low value of relative volatility, nearing unity. Such mixtures cannot be separated by simple distillation, because the volatility of the two components in the mixture is nearly the same, causing them to evaporate at nearly the same temperature at a similar rate, making normal distillation impractical.

The method of extractive distillation uses a separation solvent, which is generally non-volatile, has a high boiling point and is miscible with the mixture, but doesn&#x27;t form an azeotropic mixture. The solvent interacts differently with the components of the mixture thereby causing their relative volatilities to change. This enables the new three-part mixture to be separated by normal distillation. The original component with the greatest volatility separates out as the top product. The bottom product consists of a mixture of the solvent and the other component, which can again be separated easily because the solvent does not form an azeotrope with it. The bottom product can be separated by any of the methods available.

It is important to select a suitable separation solvent for this type of distillation. The solvent must alter the relative volatility by a wide enough margin for a successful result. The quantity, cost and availability of the solvent should be considered. The solvent should be easily separable from the bottom product, and should not react chemically with the components or the mixture, or cause corrosion in the equipment. A classic example to be cited here is the separation of an azeotropic mixture of benzene and cyclohexane, where aniline is one suitable solvent.

<doc id="1095929" wikidata="Q3104351" url="?curid=1095929" title="Gerry St. Germain">
<text>Gerry St. Germain (born November 6, 1937) is a former Canadian politician. St. Germain served as a Conservative senator for British Columbia and previously served as a Member of Parliament.

==Early life and career==
Born in Manitoba of Metis descent, he moved to British Columbia. St. Germain had various jobs prior to entering politics, working variously as a Royal Canadian Air Force pilot, police officer (Winnipeg and Vancouver Police Departments), building contractor, businessman and poultry farmer.

==Member of Parliament==
A strong Tory supporter, St. Germain was parachuted as a Progressive Conservative into the Mission-Port Moody riding for the byelection there in 1983. St. Germain was elected as a Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada at a by-election held on the same day in 1983 that Brian Mulroney was elected.

St. Germain was Member of Parliament for the now defunct riding of Mission—Port Moody from then until 1988. In March 1988, St. Germain joined the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Transport (Canada) and was later appointed as Minister of Forestry. He was also the political minister for BC at this time.

After his riding&#x27;s boundaries were changed to create the new riding of Mission-Coquitlam, St. Germain was defeated in the 1988 general election by Joy Langan. From 1989 to 1995, he was the President of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.

==Senate==
In June 1993, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada just prior to Mulroney&#x27;s retirement as Prime Minister of Canada. He chose to adopt the division of Langley-Pemberton-Whistler; such Senate divisions are merely symbolic outside Quebec. In 1998, while still a Progressive Conservative, St. Germain explored the United Alternative option, formed by Reform Party of Canada leader Preston Manning, which was an attempt to unite the right. In June 2000, he sat as an Independent Conservative senator, and in October 2000 he became the only Canadian Alliance senator. Since the Canadian Alliance formed the Official Opposition in the House of Commons, St. Germain argued that he should be the Leader of the Official Opposition in the Senate, but his arguments were rejected by the Speaker. At the request of Canadian Alliance Leader Stephen Harper, St. Germain led the negotiations to unite the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservative Party. When the two parties merged in December 2003, St. Germain became a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. On 6 November 2012, St. Germain reached the Senate&#x27;s mandatory retirement age, 75.

Gerry St. Germain was listed as the top spender for expenses in the Canadian Senate spending $378,292 in one year according to a National Post article.

<text>Hull Football Club, commonly referred to as Hull or Hull F.C., is a professional rugby league club based in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Hull play their home games at the MKM Stadium and compete in Super League, the top tier of British rugby league

Hull have won the League Championship six times and Challenge Cup five times.

The clubs traditional home colours are white shirts with black hoops and black shorts. The City of Hull is split in two by the River Hull with Hull F.C. representing the West side and cross city rivals Hull Kingston Rovers representing the East side.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The club was formed in 1865 by a group of ex-schoolboys from York, most notably Anthony Bradley, who had been at Rugby School. The founders used to meet at the Young Men&#x27;s Fellowship, at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lowgate. The vicar at that time was the Reverend Scott and his five sons made up the nucleus of the team. The club immediately took on members who were plumbers and glaziers. Soon another team, Hull White Star, was formed and the two clubs merged. Hull Football Club was one of the first clubs in the north of England to join the Rugby Football Union.

Hull F.C., then nicknamed the All Blacks, were one of the initial 22 clubs to form the Northern Union after the acrimonious split from the Rugby Football Union in 1895. The club moved from East Hull to the Hull Athletic Club at the Boulevard in 1895, and subsequently played their first ever match there in September of that year. 8,000 people turned out to witness the first club&#x27;s match in which Hull F.C. beat Liversedge RFC.
The Oxford-educated Cyril Lemprière (1870–1939), who also played for Yorkshire, was captain of Hull during the 1895–96 and 1897–98 season.

The early years of the Northern Union saw Hull F.C. prosper, and their black and white irregular hooped jerseys, which they adopted in 1909, became one of the most famous and feared strips in the league. Between 1908 and 1910, Hull F.C. lost three consecutive Challenge Cup Finals. In the first; they failed to score against Hunslet who would go on to win All Four Cups whilst in the second they failed to score against Wakefield Trinity. In the third final of 1910, they held Leeds to a 7–7 draw at Fartown, Huddersfield but were heavily beaten in the replay held two days later.
In 1913, they paid a world record £600, plus £14 per match, to Hunslet for Billy Batten, one of only seventeen players, and the only representative from Hull F.C., so far inducted into the British Rugby League Hall of Fame. A year later the Airlie Birds won their first Challenge Cup, beating Huddersfield in the semi-final and Wakefield Trinity in the final held in Halifax. Playing alongside Billy on that day was John &quot;Jack&quot; Harrison VC, MC who scored a try. Harrison scored 52 tries in the 1914–5 season, a club record that still stands. Twelve Hull F.C. players were killed during the First World War.

Australian Jim Devereux became the first player to score 100 tries for Hull.

In 1920, Batten was once again key in Hull F.C.&#x27;s first ever Championship Final, scoring the only try in the 3–2 victory over Huddersfield.

The early-1920s were bittersweet years for the club. In 1921, Hull F.C. lost the Yorkshire County Cup but won the county championship, both against rivals Hull Kingston Rovers. Hull F.C. could not match the successes of 1914, losing a further two consecutive cup finals in 1922 and 23 to Rochdale Hornets and Leeds respectively, but they managed to win the Yorkshire County Cup in 1923 and finish top of the league.

In the early 1930s, Hull F.C. had a full back and goal kicker called Joe Oliver. Oliver was so dependable with the boot that the crowd at one match spontaneously started singing the Gene Autry song, Old Faithful, at him. Hull F.C. supporters adopted the song as their battle cry from then on.

Hull F.C.&#x27;s record attendance was set in 1936 when 28,798 turned up for the visit of Leeds for a third round Challenge cup match.

=== Post-Second World War ===
The 1952 Kangaroos visited the Boulevard on Monday 8 September. They had opened their tour with a victory at Keighley two days earlier, and they continued their winning run with a 28–0 victory over Hull F.C..

In 1955, the black Welshman Roy Francis became the first black professional coach in any British team sport, when he switched from playing on the wing to coaching Hull F.C..

Hull F.C. team won the league championship in 1956 when Colin Hutton kicked a last-minute penalty in the final against Halifax at Maine Road, Manchester. Hull F.C. won the play-offs again in 1958, against Workington Town. They also won the European Club championship in 1957 and lost in the cup finals at Wembley in 1959 and 1960. These triumphs healed the wound of two successive Yorkshire County Cup Final defeats in 1955 and 1957. They lost in two further Challenge Cup finals to Wigan and Wakefield Trinity in 1959 and 1960. All these reverses, when one hand had been grasping so many trophies, gave Hull F.C. a steely resolve and a thirst for success.

Johnny Whiteley became player coach in October 1963. When Roy Francis retired as Hull F.C. coach in 1965, Whiteley took over as coach. Hull F.C. lost to Wakefield Trinity 17–10 victory in the 1968 Rugby Football League Championship final at Headingley on 4 May 1968. Whiteley resigned in 1970 to coach Hull Kingston Rovers. Ivor Watts was then appointed coach from 1970 to 1971 of which Hull F.C. won 28 matches and lost 17.

With the coaching appointment of Arthur Bunting in 1978, Hull F.C. began a period of dominance. Hull F.C. won all of their 26 Division Two matches in 1978–79, the only time a club has won all of its league matches in a season and returning to the top flight. The Airlie Birds lost the 1980 Challenge Cup final against Hull Kingston Rovers 10–5 and never won at Wembley until 2016. It was reputed that a makeshift sign was left on the A63 (the major westerly road out of Hull) that read &quot;last one out turn the lights off!&quot; due to most of the city travelling to Wembley for the final. In 1982, Hull F.C., crushed by Widnes in the Premiership Final, avenged the defeat with an 18–9 Challenge Cup replay win at Elland Road.
Hull F.C. eventually won the league in 1983 and also reached the Premiership final, the Challenge Cup final and the Yorkshire County Cup Final, but the latter trophy would be their only reward from the three finals. They lost to Featherstone Rovers at Wembley in one of the great Challenge Cup final upsets and they also lost the Premiership final three years running.

The signing of Australian Peter Sterling, a 2006 inductee into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame, maintained HullF.C.’s strength, and Bunting&#x27;s men went to their third successive Yorkshire Cup beating Hull KR 29–12, but were edged out in arguably the greatest ever Challenge Cup Final in 1985 by Wigan at Wembley Stadium with a score of 28 to 24 in Wigan&#x27;s favour. The game was played in front 99,801 fans, the rugby league attendance record for Wembley. A number of subsequent coaches, such as Brian Smith (1988–90) failed to deliver consistent success. Hull F.C. lost the Premiership final in 1989 to Widnes, but two years later returned to beat them 14–4 at Old Trafford under coach Noel Cleal.

Royce Simmons moved to England to coach Hull F.C. for two seasons from 1992 to 1994. In June 1993, financial trouble forced Hull F.C. to put seven players on the transfer list and Royce Simmons ran five marathons to raise money to pay for players from Australia.

=== Summer era ===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. As the sport in Britain entered a new era, controversy was sparked in the city of Hull when it was suggested that Hull F.C. should merge with Hull Kingston Rovers to form &#x27;Humberside&#x27;. Hull F.C.&#x27;s shareholders gave the idea general approval but it was ultimately resisted. In February 1997, the club like many other rugby league clubs, re-branded as the &quot;Hull Sharks&quot;. The newly-rebranded team finished below the cut-off point of 10th in the existing top flight and so were excluded from the new Super League.

Phil Sigsworth joined the club in 1996 and coached them to the First Division championship title and promotion to Super League in 1997 but struggled to compete in the top division. Off-field issues in 1999 saw the club offered a merger with Gateshead Thunder. Hull were offered £1.25 million as part of the agreement. At the start of the 2000 Super League season however, the club reverted to the name Hull F.C. and continued to play at The Boulevard without any acknowledgement towards Gateshead. A new Gateshead Thunder would be formed for the 2001 Premiership season. Ex-St. Helens coach Shaun McRae who remained at the helm until 2004.

After 107 years at the Boulevard, Hull F.C. moved in January 2003 to a £44 million state-of-the-art council-owned Kingston Communications Stadium, more commonly known as the KC Stadium and the rejuvenation of the club continued. Although they are joint tenants at the stadium alongside the city&#x27;s football club Championship side Hull City : the two teams sharing use of the stadium, Hull F.C. have been forced to play a cup match away at Doncaster to avoid two matches clashing. Shaun McRae left the club to return to Australia at the end of the 2004 season; he was replaced by former England coach John Kear, who had previously been McRae&#x27;s deputy.

In his first season at the club, Kear led Hull F.C. to the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final for the first time since 1985. Hull F.C. defeated Leeds 25–24 in a thrilling final at Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium to lift the trophy. Paul Cooke&#x27;s 77th minute try, which was converted by Danny Brough gave Hull a 1-point lead, which they held onto after Hull F.C. captain Richard Swain charged down a drop-goal attempt from Leeds skipper Kevin Sinfield in the dying seconds of the match.

John Kear left Hull F.C. on 3 April 2006 after a disappointing start to the season, which saw Hull F.C. lose four out of their first seven league games and also their defence of the Challenge Cup being ended at the first hurdle against the Bradford Bulls in a 23–12 defeat, to be replaced by Australian Peter Sharp who was recruited from Parramatta Eels where he was assistant coach. Between 14 April – 15 July 2006 Hull F.C. won 13 matches in succession, including a 27–26 defeat of the league leaders St Helens on 8 June 2006. The last time they beat St Helens on their ground was 18 years ago. This run ended in defeat at Harlequins RL on 23 July 2006. Hull F.C. managed to finish in second place, their highest league position in the Super League era. They lost to the league leaders St. Helens in the first Grand Final playoff game, but succeeded in reaching the final by defeating the reigning champions Bradford. Over 20,000 Hull F.C. fans travelled to Old Trafford, but again they lost out to the Saints, this time by 26–4. The overall attendance broke the Grand Final record, mainly due to the stadium&#x27;s recent expansion.

For the 2007 season, Hull F.C. signed five players: Matt Sing (a prolific National Rugby League try-scorer and Australian representative), Hutch Maiava, Willie Manu, Danny Tickle and Wayne Godwin. The &#x27;Hull Derby&#x27; also returned for the 2007 season due to Rovers&#x27; promotion from National League 1. The first of four of these derby matches was played on Easter Monday, 9 April 2007, at the KC Stadium. The game was played in front of a sell-out attendance of 23,002 and ended with a result for the Black and Whites who had been struggling early in the season. The final score was 22–14 with Sid Domic crossing the line for the Airlie Birds in the final seconds.
On 23 April Paul Cooke, stand-off, controversially resigned from Hull Football Club to join Hull Kingston Rovers. Cooke claimed he was out of contract as he had not signed the contract that the club had offered him. Following his departure, club chief executive David Plummer resigned. His replacement James Rule has come in for much criticism.

Hull F.C. have endured a poor 2008 season and on 19 May 2008 the club dismissed coach Peter Sharp. A week later they appointed his assistant Richard Agar as his replacement. John Sharp has since been named as an addition to the Hull F.C. coaching staff. Hull F.C. finished a poor 11th in the League in 2008, falling far short of the fans expectations, although a Challenge cup final appearance and a successful franchise application ensured the season was not a complete failure. The club announced that Australian test forward Michael Crocker will sign for the club on a three-year contract from the start of the 2008–09 season. Fullback Chris Thorman has signed a one-year deal for 2009, after leaving Huddersfield. Matty Dale, Matt Sing and James Webster were released at the end of the season, with former Hull Kingston Rovers favourite Webster having only played one game.

In March 2009 Michael Crocker was denied a visa to come to England to play for Hull F.C.. Hull F.C. announced four big name signings for the 2010 SL season: Craig Fitzgibbon, Mark O&#x27;Meley, Sean Long, and Jordan Tansey (although Tansey arrived at the club towards the end of the 2009 season, having been released early from his contract at Sydney Roosters). Several long serving players left the club at the end of the forgettable 2009 season, including Paul King, Graeme Horne, and Gareth Raynor.

Super League XV started well with five wins from the first seven games, the two losses coming away against Crusaders and Wigan Warriors. F.C. beat Hull K.R. 18–14 in the first derby of the year at Craven Park, but then followed a period of one win from five games, in which the team were convincingly knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Leeds. Hull F.C. finished the regular season in 6th place, however a convincing 21–4 home defeat by rivals Hull Kingston Rovers brought an early end to their playoff campaign.

On 22 July 2011 it was confirmed that Hull City&#x27;s Head of Football Operations, Adam Pearson had purchased the entire shareholding of the club together with his close friend Mikey Drake and they had taken over full control from Kath Hetherington. In a statement on the club&#x27;s website, it was also confirmed that James Rule would continue as chief executive.

Richard Agar left the club at the end of the 2011 season and was replaced by Australian Peter Gentle. The 2012 season was a largely transitional one, with high player turnover and many injuries hampering the side&#x27;s progress mid-season; however, the club finished a respectable 6th in the regular season. They went on to convincingly beat Huddersfield in the first round of play-off games but fell to defeat away at Warrington in the preliminary semi-finals.

For the 2013 season, Hull F.C. again finished 6th in the regular season and beat Catalans at home in the first round of the play-offs but were comprehensively beaten 76–18 by Huddersfield in the second round. Hull F.C. also reached the Challenge cup final for the first time in 5 years but were beaten 16–0 by Wigan. On 24 September 2013 Hull F.C. announced the departure of Peter Gentle with two years still remaining on his contract. It is thought the record loss to Huddersfield in the play-offs along with the poor performance at Wembley were the main factors behind his demise. The next day Hull F.C. announced that 34-year-old assistant Lee Radford would become Head Coach from 2014 and Andy Last would step up to become Lee&#x27;s assistant. Former player Motu Tony became the new director of football, replacing outgoing director Shaun McRae.

In 2016, a promising beginning to the season was crushed with a 46–6 loss to Widnes. After the match, coach Lee Radford and his staff were asked to leave the changing room by the Hull F.C. squad. Following this initial defeat, Hull endured a 10-game winning streak and finished on top of the Super League table. Hull FC won at Wembley Stadium for the first time in the club&#x27;s history, defeating Warrington in the 2016 Challenge Cup Final and defending their title in 2017 by also defeating Wigan. Following the win at Wembley, Hull ended the 2016 season by finishing 3rd in the Super 8&#x27;s; Hull later lost to Wigan in the semi-finals of the play offs.

In March 2020, Hull FC announced the departure of Lee Radford after a 38–4 home loss to Warrington Wolves. It transpired to be Hull FC&#x27;s final fixture before the nation was put into lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Assistant coach Andy Last was put in interim charge of the club until the end of the 2020 season, guiding the team to the play-off semi-finals, where they were eventually upended by Wigan Warriors. Last departed the club at the end of the 2020 season to take up an assistant coach role at fellow Super League club Wakefield Trinity.

In November 2020, Hull FC announced that Brett Hodgson would take over as head coach of the club for the 2021 season. The Australian coach won his first game of the season against the club he once played for, Huddersfield Giants.

Hull FC played their first match in front of spectators following the COVID-19 lockdown on 17 May 2021. They were defeated 27–10 by Catalans Dragons at home.

Hull F.C. started the 2021 Super League season in strong fashion, only losing once in their opening seven games. However, the club ended the season winning only once in their last nine matches. This saw Hull F.C. finish the year in 8th place on the table.

Hull F.C. finished the 2022 Super League season in 9th place on the table. Head coach Brett Hodgson resigned from his post and was replaced by Tony Smith for the 2023 season.

Hull F.C. started the 2023 Super League season with two wins in a row under new head coach Tony Smith. However, the club would then record seven successive league defeats and sat second bottom of the table by round 10 of the competition. On 11 April 2024, Smith stepped down as head coach after 18 months in charge. Hull F.C. had started the 2024 Super League season poorly losing six of their first seven matches with their only victory coming in a last gasp effort against the London Broncos. Under Smith, Hull F.C. in 2024 conceded 50 points or more on three occasions. The 2024 season saw the first time Hull FC lost 20 or more league fixtures since 1999.

== Stadiums ==

=== 1895–2002: The Boulevard ===
Hull F.C. moved into The Boulevard shortly after the formation of the Northern Rugby Football Union. Between 1904 and 1905 the ground was shared with Hull City A.F.C. and speedway also took place during the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, and also had a greyhound track in 2007. The Boulevard also hosted many international rugby league games. Like a number of grounds at the time, the pitch at The Boulevard was surrounded by a Motorcycle speedway track that was also later used for Greyhound racing.

=== 2003 – present: MKM Stadium ===
In 2003 Hull F.C. moved into the KC Stadium, renamed KCOM Stadium in 2016 and MKM Stadium in 2021, which they share with Hull City for a second time in their history. The record attendance for a rugby league ground was 23,004 in 2007 when they played local rivals Hull Kingston Rovers.

<text>Plauen (; ; Czech: &quot;Plavno&quot;) is a town in Saxony, Germany with a population of around 65,000. It is Saxony&#x27;s 5th most populated city after Leipzig, Dresden, Chemnitz and Zwickau, the second-largest city of the Vogtland after Gera, as well as the largest city in the Saxon Vogtland region (&quot;Sächsisches Vogtland&quot;).

The city lies on the upper reaches of the White Elster River, a tributary of the Saale, in the Central Vogtlandian Hill Country. Plauen is the southwesternmost city of a string of cities sitting in the densely populated foreland of the Elster and Ore Mountains, stretching from Plauen in the southwest via Zwickau, Chemnitz and Freiberg to Dresden in the northeast. It is the county seat of the Vogtland District. Plauen directly borders Greiz in Thuringia to the north, and it is also situated near the Saxon border with Bavaria (Franconia) and the Czech Republic (Bohemia).

Plauen and the surrounding Saxon Vogtland are known as the historic center of the German embroidery and lace industry, and the products of the region are protected under the label &quot;&quot; (&quot;Plauen Lace&quot;). The Elster Viaduct (&quot;Elstertalbrücke&quot;), spanning the valley of the White Elster between Plauen and Pöhl, is the second-largest bridge built out of bricks in the world, after the Göltzsch Viaduct.

Despite its location in Saxony the regional Vogtlandian dialect spoken in Plauen is a variety of East Franconian (with Saxon influences) related to the dialects of neighbouring Franconia in Bavaria. The name of the city as well as the names of many of its neighborhoods and boroughs are of Slavic origin.

==History==
Plauen was founded by Polabian Slavs in the 12th century as &quot;Plawe&quot; and was passed to the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1327. The town was captured by the Archbishop of Magdeburg, , in 1384. In 1466, it was passed to Albertine Saxony and later in 1569 to the Electorate of Saxony. Plauen became incorporated into the Kingdom of Saxony in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, and in 1871 it became part of the German Empire.

In the late-19th century, Plauen became a centre of textile manufacturing, specializing in Chemical lace, called Plauen lace. Around 1910, Plauen, as an industrial &#x27;boomtown&#x27; of the region, reached its population peak (1910 census: 121,000, 1912: 128,000). Plauen&#x27;s population, however, has shrunk dramatically since the Second World War (1939: 111,000 inhabitants).

In the 1930s, Plauen hosted the first chapter of the Nazi Party outside of Bavaria.

During the war, the Nazis operated a prison in the town, and three subcamps of the Flossenbürg concentration camp. 500 women, mostly Polish, but also Russian, Italian, French, Yugoslavian and Croatian, were imprisoned and used as forced labour in the first two subcamps, and 50 men from various countries were imprisoned in the third subcamp. It was occupied by American troops on 16 April 1945 but was left to Red Army on 1 July 1945. On 15 December 1945, the city issued 7 semi-postal postage stamps of its own to raise money for reconstruction.

From 1945 onwards, Plauen fell into the Soviet occupation zone of Germany, which later became the German Democratic Republic (1949–1990). Plauen hosted a large Red Army occupation garrison and, in the last years of the GDR (DDR), an officer school of the Border Guards (&quot;Grenztruppen der DDR&quot;). The first mass demonstration against the communist regime in the GDR began in Plauen on 7 October 1989; this was the beginning of a series of mass demonstrations across the country and ultimately led to the re-unification of Germany in 1990.

The exposé &quot;Fast Food Nation&quot; gives special mention to Plauen as the first city of the GDR to have a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant following the collapse of the Berlin Wall.

As part of Saxony&#x27;s local government reform of July 1st 2008, Plauen lost its status as a district-free city and was integrated into the Vogtlandkreis district.

==Jewish Community of Plauen==
 The Jewish community of Plauen dates back to the early 14th century and numbered several hundred between the two world wars. A reform-Jewish, bauhaus-style synagogue was opened in 1930, only to be demolished in 1938 during the Krystallnacht. 
Plauen becoming a Nazi stronghold, attacks against the Jewish community were frequent in the 1920s. Physically labelled Jews are documented from 1932. Most of the Jewish population either left or was killed during The Holocaust. 
Today, no Jewish community exists in Plauen. The city of Plauen maintains a few sites in the city to commemorate past Jewish life in Plauen, such as the Jewish Cemetery.

A 3D-model of the Jewish Synagogue of Plauen was designed by Prof. Marc Grellert and his team from the TU Darmstadt as a part of his project to 3D-design German synagogues that were demolished before, during and after WW2.

==Politics==
The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who served from 1990 to 2000. The mayor was originally chosen by the city council, but since 1994 has been directly elected. of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) was mayor between 2000 and 2021. The most recent mayoral election was held in two rounds on 13 June and 4 July 2021, in which Steffen Zenner (CDU) was elected.

<text>William Ros, 3rd Baron Ros of Helmsley (19 May 1329 – Bef. 29 September 1352) was a military commander under Edward III of England. He was knighted by the king in 1346, having helped raise the siege of Aiguillon. In the same year, he was one of the lords who led the second division in the Battle of Crécy, and afterwards commanded the fourth division of the English army against the Scots, near Neville&#x27;s Cross, when David Bruce, with many of the Scottish nobles, was taken prisoner.

On July 12, 1346, he was among several young men (including Edward, the Black Prince) knighted by King Edward III of England at the church of St. Vigor in Quettehou in anticipation of their service in the campaign that was to culminate in the Battle of Crécy and the siege of Calais. A plaque commemorates this event.

In 1346, he was with Edward III and the Black Prince, at the siege of Calais, when it was taken by the English.

In 1352, he accompanied Henry of Grosmont, Duke of Lancaster on his journey to Prussia; but died the same year, before the feast of St Michael, aged twenty-three, and was buried abroad.

==Marriage==
William Ros married, about 28 August 1349, Margaret Neville (d. May 1372), daughter of Ralph Neville, 2nd Baron Neville, by whom he had no issue.

His widow married secondly, as his first wife, Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland.

<text>Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani () was a short-lived political party founded by veteran Tamil film actor Sivaji Ganesan that existed from 10 February 1988 to December 1989. Sivaji Ganesan had a long running relation with many political parties, with his first movie itself being a movie of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).This party also contested on ladder symbol in 1989 election.

The party was born in 10 February 1988 after a split in the Tamil Nadu faction of the Indian National Congress. The split itself was after another party All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) broke into two fragments one led by V. N. Janaki and R. M. Veerappan and other by J. Jayalalithaa. Ganesan and his supporters left the Congress on differences in opinion on which fragment of ADMK to ally with in 1989 state elections.

Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani backed V. N. Janaki Ramachandran&#x27;s fragment of the party and lost in all seats it competed for. Ganesan eventually regretted his decision to float his own party and merged the party with Janata Dal in December 1989.

== Sivaji Ganesan ==
Sivaji Ganesan was one of the foremost stars of Tamil film industry. Born as V. C. Ganesan, he was christened Sivaji by Periyar, who was then leading the Dravidar Kazhagam and the Self-respect movement, in the 1940s. He debuted in the Tamil movie Parasakthi in 1952, a movie which heavily contained elements of Dravidian politics. Although Ganesan was a member of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam he found that atheistic outlook of the party to cost him his movie fame. He was also frustrated with importance given to M. G. Ramachandran, another movie star, in the party. But yet he stayed on in the party until his visit to Tirumala Venkateswara Temple became a center of controversy within the DMK. Responding to the controversy Ganesan called the DMK &quot;a glamour party&quot; and moved to Tamil National Party. The Tamil National Party was itself formed by former members of DMK such as E. V. K. Sampath and Kannadasan. Later Ganesan joined the Indian National Congress when Tamil National Party was merged with it.

== Birth of Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani ==
M. G. Ramachandran had been heading the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) as its founder after his feud with M. Karunanidhi in 1972. He had been the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu since 1977 until his death in 1987. Soon after his death the party broke into two, one headed by his wife V. N. Janaki Ramachandran and other by another Tamil movie star J. Jayalalithaa. Election Commission of India refused to accept either of them as the original ADMK. Tamil Nadu Congress decided to ally with only united AIADMK.

This move was opposed by Sivaji Ganesan and hence he left the party along with his supporters to form the new party Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani on 10 February 1988. To popularise the party Ganesan produce a movie titled &quot;En Thamizh En Makkal&quot; (My Tamil language and my people). At the time the party was created it was considered to be pro-Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) along with ADMK faction led by R. M. Veerappan. The party opposed the presence of Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka stating that the force was trying to wipe out the LTTE and its leader V. Prabhakaran. The party also urged the Government of India to hold talks with the LTTE without any pre- condition.

== Merger with Janata Dal ==
The party lost every seat it contested for in the 1989 elections. Sivaji himself lost at Thiruvaiyaru to a DMK candidate by a margin of 10,643 votes. Soon after the election he dissolved the party and asked his party cadres to join Janata Dal which he himself did after an invitation from V. P. Singh. Later in his life Sivaji Ganesan regretted to have ever floated his own party and reportedly said: 

On other occasion he added:

<doc id="1095950" wikidata="Q7902334" url="?curid=1095950" title="Utah Constitutional Amendment 3">
<text>Utah Constitutional Amendment 3 was an amendment to the Utah state constitution that sought to define marriage as a union exclusively between a man and woman. It passed in the November 2, 2004, election, as did similar amendments in ten other states.

The amendment, which added Article 1, Section 29, to the Utah Constitution, reads:

#&quot;Marriage consists only of the legal union between a man and a woman.&quot;
#&quot;No other domestic union, however denominated, may be recognized as a marriage or given the same or substantially equivalent legal effect.&quot;

On December 20, 2013, federal judge Robert J. Shelby of the U.S. District Court for Utah struck down Amendment 3 as unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the U.S. Constitution.

==Background==
Both pro and anti amendment groups formed to sway voters. The &quot;Don&#x27;t Amend Alliance&quot; organized in spring, much earlier than pro-amendment groups. The Alliance raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, catching supporters of the amendment by surprise. They responded with the &quot;Yes! For Marriage&quot; group, which only began a coordinated campaign on October 5. Nonetheless, latent support for the amendment appeared high with over 60% support for the Amendment in a &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; poll conducted early October.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS church), though not officially endorsing the amendment, publicized a statement in July endorsing constitutional amendments that define marriage. On October 20, just 13 days before Utahns voted on the amendment, the LDS church officially stated that &quot;Any other sexual relations, including those between persons of the same gender, undermine the divinely created institution of the family. &quot;The Church accordingly favors measures that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman and that do not confer legal status on any other sexual relationship.&quot;&quot; Supporters of the amendment asserted the second statement showed specific LDS support for Amendment 3. Others, including moderately conservative Latter-day Saint KSL radio talk show host Doug Wright, believed that since the new statement applied only to &quot;sexual relations&quot; it highlighted precisely how Amendment 3 went too far.

The Episcopal church publicly opposed the amendment.

Three candidates for Utah attorney general, including incumbent Republican Mark Shurtleff, issued a joint statement opposing the amendment on August 6. In many other political races, notably the gubernatorial race, candidates weighed in on this issue.

On November 2, 2004, Amendment 3 was approved by 66% of Utah voters, (rejected in two counties) in a closer than expected race. Governor Huntsman proposed reciprocal benefits for gay couples in reaction. The reciprocal beneficiary measure failed in the Utah Senate during the 2005 legislative session on a ten in favor to eighteen opposed poll.

On December 20, 2013 Amendment 3 was ruled unconstitutional by Federal District Court Judge Robert J. Shelby in Salt Lake City. The state government is expected to appeal.

On January 6, 2014 the United States Supreme Court issued a stay of Judge Shelby&#x27;s ruling &quot;pending final disposition,&quot; according to the order. The Court&#x27;s order reinstates the state Constitutional ban and will keep it intact until after a federal appeals court has ruled on it. The order appeared to have the support of the full Court, since there were no noted dissents.

==Arguments for Amendment 3==
Supporters of Amendment 3 said that the amendment would do three things:

#Prevent state courts from making a ruling that current Utah marriage legislation as being unconstitutional.
#Prevent state courts from forcing recognition of out-of-state marriages.
#Prevent the creation of &quot;counterfeit marriages&quot;, such as civil unions.

They also said the amendment would not hurt heterosexual marriage, common-law marriages, or the right to will property to whomever one wishes.

==Arguments against Amendment 3==
Those opposed to the amendment say that section one of the amendment is completely unnecessary since Utah already outlaws same-sex marriage. They also say the second part of the amendment &quot;goes too far&quot;. They feel that it would invalidate common-law marriage as well as reducing rights to will property to whomever one chooses.

==Results==
On November 2, 2004 Amendment 3 passed by a margin of 65.8% to 33.2%. Results were 593,297 votes for and 307,488 votes against the amendment. The amendment went into effect on January 1, 2005. Utah courts in 2006 ruled that the amendment does not ban domestic partnerships and allowed Salt Lake City&#x27;s domestic partnership registry to stand. In 2009, Utah Governor Jon Huntsman indicated it was his belief the amendment would not ban civil unions. 

== Court challenge ==

On March 25, 2013, three same-sex couples, including one already married in Iowa, filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah seeking to declare Utah&#x27;s prohibition on the recognition of same-sex marriages unconstitutional under the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the United States Constitution. The court heard arguments on December 4. The state argued that there was &quot;nothing unusual&quot; in enforcing policies that encourage &quot;responsible procreation&quot; and the &quot;optimal mode of child-rearing&quot;. Plaintiffs&#x27; attorney contended that the policy is &quot;based on prejudice and bias that is religiously grounded in this state&quot;.

On December 20, 2013, District Judge Robert J. Shelby struck down the same-sex marriage ban as unconstitutional and violating same-gender couples&#x27; their rights to due process and equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. The ruling prevents the State from enforcing Sections 30-1-2 and 30-1-4.1 of the Utah Code and Article I, § 29 of the Utah Constitution to the extent these laws prohibit a person from marrying another person of the same sex. Historian J. Seth Anderson and neuroscientist Michael Ferguson were the first same-sex couple legally married in Utah on Dec. 20, 2013. State Senator Jim Dabakis and his partner of 27 years were among the first same-sex couples to marry in the state.

Same sex marriages were performed in Salt Lake, Washington and Cache counties on December 20. Other counties declined to grant same-sex couples their request. At least one same-sex couple planned to camp overnight at the Salt Lake County Clerk&#x27;s Office in anticipation of it opening at 8 a.m., one hour before the 9 a.m. hearing scheduled to hear a Motion for Stay submitted by the State of Utah in the 10th District Court. An Emergency Motion to Stay, which would have granted a stay pending the ruling on the stay that is the subject of a hearing scheduled for December 23, was denied December 22.

The United States Supreme Court issued an order on Monday, January 6, 2014, that halted same-sex marriages until an appeal is decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

On January 16, Attorney General Sean Reyes named Gene C. Schaerr, former law clerk to Supreme Court Justices Warren Burger and Antonin Scalia, as lead outside counsel to make Utah&#x27;s case to the Tenth Circuit. Schaerr was to be aided in the appeal by former Michigan Solicitor General John Bursch and Idaho Attorney (and former U.S. Attorney for the District of Nevada), Monte N. Stewart.

That same day, the Utah State Tax Commission announced that it will allow married same-sex couples to file joint income tax returns for 2013.

The Tenth Circuit heard oral argument on April 10, 2014. On June 25, 2014, a three-judge panel consisting of Judges Paul Joseph Kelly, Jr., Carlos F. Lucero, and Jerome Holmes of the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court&#x27;s ruling in a 2-1 decision. Judge Lucero wrote the majority opinion and was joined by Judge Holmes, with Judge Kelly authoring a dissent. The ruling was immediately stayed pending appeal. On August 5, Utah appealed the ruling to the United States Supreme Court.

On October 6, 2014, the Supreme Court denied to review &quot;Kitchen&quot;, allowing the Tenth Circuit&#x27;s decision to become final. Thus, Utah was required to immediately begin licensing and recognizing same-sex marriages. This decision also became binding on federal courts throughout the Tenth Circuit, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico (the only state that already allowed same-sex marriage prior to &quot;Kitchen&quot;).

<text>Idiot&#x27;s Delight is a 1939 MGM comedy drama with a screenplay adapted by Robert E. Sherwood from his 1936 Pulitzer-Prize-winning play of the same name. The production reunited director Clarence Brown, Clark Gable and Norma Shearer eight years after they worked together on &quot;A Free Soul&quot;. The play takes place in a hotel in the Italian Alps during 24 hours at the beginning of a world war. The film begins with the backstory of the two leads and transfers the later action to a fictitious Alpine country rather than Italy, which was the setting for the play. In fact, Europe was on the brink of World War II. (The studio&#x27;s attempts to make the film palatable for the totalitarian states—including the hazy geographical location and the scrupulous use of Esperanto in speech and signage—were a waste of time. They banned it anyway.) Although not a musical, it is notable as the only film in which Gable sings and dances, performing Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot; with a sextette of chorus girls.

==Plot==
Harry Van, an American World War I veteran, tries to reenter show business and ends up in a faltering mentalist show with Madame Zuleika, an inept, aging alcoholic. While performing in Omaha, Nebraska, he is wooed by Irene, a trapeze artist who claims to be a refugee from the Russian Revolution and hopes to replace Harry&#x27;s drunken partner in the show and as his lover. They have a romantic night, but he is suspicious of Irene&#x27;s flights of fancy. The next day, Harry and Zuleika and Irene and her troupe board trains going in opposite directions.

Twenty years later, after a number of jobs, Harry is the impresario for and lead performer with Les Blondes, a troupe of six women traveling through Europe. While taking a train from Romania to Switzerland, they are stranded at an Alpine hotel in an unnamed country, whose borders are suddenly closed as war becomes imminent. The passengers watch through the hotel lounge&#x27;s huge windows as dozens of bombers take off from an air field at the bottom of the valley and fly away in formation.

Among the passengers in the lounge, Harry observes Irene, a glamorous platinum blonde with an exaggerated Russian accent, who is the mistress of a wealthy armaments manufacturer, Achille Weber. Although she claims never to have been to Omaha, Harry&#x27;s innuendoes show he is convinced that she is the brunette acrobat he knew there. He believes that she recognizes him, too. An agitated pacifist rants to his fellow travelers about Weber&#x27;s guns, which he says are behind the war that just started, and describes for them how the planes they saw disappear over the spectacular mountains will be killing thousands of people in other countries. The pacifist is hauled away and shot by the border police, commanded by the friendly and impeccable Captain Kirvline, who mingles with the travelers while they wait at the hotel.

In their hotel suite, Irene explodes and tells Weber &quot;the truth [she has] always wanted to tell.&quot; She blames him for the likely deaths of untold numbers of people in the war, whose victims might include the newlywed English couple, the Cherrys, they met at the hotel, all killed with the weapons that Weber sells.

The Swiss border opens again the next day, and the people at the hotel are told to continue on their journeys. They learn they had better be off as soon as possible because foreign countries are likely to retaliate today for yesterday&#x27;s air raid and bomb the air field below the hotel, which could be hit by mistake. As everyone rushes to leave, Irene finds out that Weber has decided to dump her: He refuses to vouch for her flimsy League of Nations passport to Capt. Kirvline, who tells Irene she must stay at the hotel.

Having escorted Les Blondes to the Swiss border, Harry returns to stay with Irene. She admits she is the woman he met in Omaha 20 years ago, and she still loves him. Harry talks about her future, performing with him and the blondes. They hear approaching planes and are told to run to the shelter, but Irene declares she does not want to die in a cellar. As Harry tries to take her there anyway, a bomb hits the hotel and blocks their escape from the lounge.

===Alternate endings===
In the play, the curtain goes down on Harry and Irene as they sing &quot;Onward, Christian Soldiers&quot; while bombs explode outside, leaving their survival an open question. That ending was filmed, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in January 1939 that preview audiences hated it. Retakes were ordered. The two surviving versions of the film&#x27;s ending show the couple safe and happy after surviving the air raid.

In an ending intended for international audiences, Irene asks Harry to play a hymn, something from his childhood. They quietly sing &quot;Abide with Me&quot;, their backs turned to the furious air battle behind them. “I&#x27;ve loved you all the time,” he says. “Thanks for telling me, darling,” she replies. The explosions stop. “Look Harry, they&#x27;ve gone away,” Irene cries, and they embrace.

In 1999, TCM aired a print that shows both endings. After &quot;The End&quot; a title card says: &quot;You have just seen the original &#x27;International&#x27; 1939 ending of MGM&#x27;s &#x27; Delight&#x27; which is spiritual and optimistic in tone. We now present the original &#x27;domestic&#x27; theatrical ending that seems to ignore the fact that the rest of the world is at war.&quot; In the domestic (U.S. and Canadian) ending, Harry and Irene talk about their plans for the future while the bombs explode outside the lobby window. They rehearse the secret code he used in his mind-reading act. The bombing stops and Irene excitedly describes their future act together while Harry plays the damaged piano. In September 2022, Watch TCM was only showing the international ending.

==Production==
In an effort to make the play, staged entirely in the hotel lounge, less wordy and more attractive to watch on the screen, Sherwood wrote the script for MGM with 167 scenes on 42 sets. The Internet Movie Database says that Vicki Baum, most famous for Grand Hotel, did uncredited work on the screenplay. 

When Warner Bros. considered filming Sherwood&#x27;s play, film censor Joseph Breen predicted it &quot;would be banned widely abroad and might cause reprisals against the American company distributing it. The play is fundamentally anti-war propaganda, and contains numerous diatribes against militarism, fascism, and the munitions ring.&quot; MGM tried to address similar concerns, eventually hiring Italy&#x27;s consul in Los Angeles as adviser. Rome agreed to cooperate on the production. In the end—although the script was supposedly approved by Fascist leader Benito Mussolini—Italy banned the film.

“Idiot&#x27;s delight&quot; refers to one of several games of solitaire or patience. In the play, Irene berates armaments manufacturer Weber (whose mistress she is) for his contribution to the war. He replies: “I am but the humble instrument of His divine will.” Her answer: “We don&#x27;t do half enough justice to Him. Poor, lonely old soul. Sitting up in heaven, with nothing to do, but play solitaire. Poor, dear God. Playing idiot&#x27;s delight.”. In the film, Capt. Kirvline mumbles “idiot&#x27;s delight&quot; when Harry asks him the reason for the war.

TCM.com observes: “This was the only film in which Clark Gable performed a dance number. He spent 6 weeks rehearsing the steps with the dance director George King, and practicing at home with his wife, Carole Lombard. Because of his fear of messing it up during a take, the set was closed during the filming of this sequence. When Gable had to sing ‘Puttin’ on the Ritz’ he actually had to be carried off by Les Blondes, so they saved that [scene] for last in case he was injured. On the day of the shooting Carole Lombard came to watch and was amazed that it only took one take.”

Norma Shearer&#x27;s distinctive pageboy hairstyle was copied from the hairstyle worn by Lynn Fontanne when she originated the character in the Broadway production of the stage play.

==Reception==
A December 31, 1938, review in &quot;Variety&quot; praised author Robert Sherwood, saying he &quot;deftly added an entertaining prolog establishing the early meeting and a one-night affair between Clark Gable and Norma Shearer in Omaha as small time vaudeville performers. This provides plenty of entertainment when the pair meet later in an Alpine hotel.&quot;

On February 3, 1939, &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic raved in a long review: “It is with boundless enthusiasm, with uncritical hornpipes in the street, and wild huzzas of approval that finally, at long last, we hail the arrival of an adult picture on the local screen. As a profoundly bitter preview—profound because its bitterness wears the mask of comedy—of the trivial circumstances which will undoubtedly attend the beginning of the next World War, &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight,&quot; at the Capitol, is as timely as tomorrow&#x27;s front page… by the very nature of its theme, (it) exposes the essential idiocy and pointlessness of militarism, … the suicidal greed, the monstrous complacency toward death and destruction which are not racial, but universal; not individual, but mass phenomena, as ugly and as international as hate. ….As for the chief characters, they have retained their considerable, if somewhat pat, theatrical charm, and they are still Mr. Sherwood&#x27;s. … we are ready to suppose that the present American ending, on what can only be described as a note of defiant hooferism, with Gable pounding on the piano and Miss Shearer ecstatically &quot;trucking&quot; as the walls collapse, was the best that was cinematically available. (There is a different ending for Great Britain, with sentimental songs). Even that effect of the conventional movie fadeout, as the bombers recede, we can accept.” Recalling the play&#x27;s ending, he observed: “No doubt the fine irony of Mr. Sherwood&#x27;s conclusion that feeling, as the &quot;two cheap people&quot; burst hysterically into &quot;Onward Christian Soldiers.&quot; that the gods were laughing would have been unseemly in a movie theatre. … Did we say that &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot; makes a swell movie? If you don&#x27;t see it you&#x27;ll be missing one of the year&#x27;s events.”

Writing in &quot;The Spectator,&quot; Graham Greene observed: &quot;“&quot;Over-acting could hardly go further...”

Nelson Bell observed in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; on February 8, 1939: “Mr. Sherwood selected his title with a view to epitomizing his free notions of the motivation, in presumably high places, of armed conflict. His editorial instinct is highly emblazoned in the expression, in two words, of the only feasible basis that can exist for the precipitation of international slaughter.”

==Box office==
According to MGM records, the film recorded a loss of $374,000, one of only three films that Clark Gable made at MGM to lose money. The others are &quot;Parnell&quot; and &quot;Too Hot to Handle&quot;.

<text>Salford Red Devils are a professional rugby league club in Salford, England. They play home games at Salford Community Stadium in Barton upon Irwell and compete in the Super League, the top tier of British rugby league.

Salford Red Devils have won the League Championship six times and Challenge Cup once. The club&#x27;s traditional home colours are red white and blue. They have a local rivalry with Swinton Lions and other significant rivalries with Oldham and Rochdale.

==History==
===Early years===

The club was founded in 1873 by the boys of the Cavendish Street Chapel in Hulme, Manchester. Using a local field, the boys organised matches amongst themselves before moving to nearby Moss Side.
In an attempt to recruit new members, the link with the school was broken in 1875 and the name &quot;Cavendish Football Club&quot; was adopted. They moved to a new base on the Salford side of the River Irwell at Throstle Nest Weir in Ordsall. Two seasons later, they moved again to the west side of Trafford Road to a ground known as the Mile Field where they spent the 1877–78 season. Their next home was a field north of the former Manchester Racecourse, New Barnes. Their first season there, 1878–79, was the last to be played under the Cavendish name.
Cavendish became &quot;Salford Football Club&quot; in 1879. The first match as Salford was at Dewsbury on 4 October 1879. The following week heralded the first home match at New Barnes against Widnes, on 11 October 1879. The result was a draw with one try each.
Salford struggled to attract support as there were few local players in the team. In 1881, they almost disbanded but instead merged with the Crescent Football Club. This placed Salford firmly on the rugby map, it was an exciting period and, during the remaining 15 years as members of the Rugby Football Union, seventeen Salford players were selected for Lancashire, three by the North of England and two, Harry Eagles and Tom Kent, for England. Since the 1881 merger, only 62 matches were lost from 263 played in the remaining nine years of the decade.
In 1889, Salford moved their headquarters to the nearby London and North Western Hotel on Cross Lane. Salford switched from their traditional amber, black and scarlet hoops to red jerseys. The club became the first side to win the Lancashire League in 1892–93.
Salford along with Leigh and Wigan, were suspended for professionalism by the Rugby Football Union in 1895, and placed joint bottom of the Lancashire league. With automatic promotion and relegation, they faced dropping down a division, and potential financial ruin. That same year, the leading Lancashire and Yorkshire clubs formed the breakaway Northern Union, Salford initially remained loyal to the Rugby Football Union but in April 1896 Salford held a special meeting to discuss joining the new organisation. Only three members opposed the motion.

Salford were admitted to the Northern Union on 2 June 1896. Their first competitive Northern Union match was on Saturday, 5 September 1896, with a visit to Widnes. The Reds, competing in the Lancashire Senior Competition, lost 10–0, and only three matches were won in the League that season. Their form improved and they finished third place in 1898–99. In 1900, Salford met old local rivals, Swinton, in the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final at Fallowfield, Manchester. After a keenly fought contest, the result was a 16–8 win for Swinton.

===20th century===
In 1900, Salford received notice to vacate New Barnes as the Manchester Ship Canal Company had purchased the land. Salford agreed a 14-year lease on of land belonging to the Willows Estate Company, named after the abundance of willow trees in the area. Salford made their début at the Willows on 21 December 1901, beating Swinton 2–0, the official attendance reaching 16,981. James Lomas became rugby league&#x27;s first £100 transfer, from Bramley to Salford in 1901.

The club continued making progress in the Rugby League Challenge Cup, reaching the semi-final stages in 1902, 1903, 1906, 1907 and 1910. On three occasions, they succeeded in reaching the final, but lost 0–25 to Broughton Rangers in 1902, 0–7 to Halifax in 1903 and 0–5 to Bradford in 1906. The Championship also proved elusive, the Reds finishing runners-up for three consecutive seasons from 1901 to 1902. In the last of those, Salford and Bradford finished level on points with Salford having the superior scoring record. Despite that, the Reds had to take part in a deciding match at Halifax, which they lost 5–0.

The Kiwis, then known as the All Golds, visited in 1907, and Salford played them on 28 December, losing 9–2 in front of a reported 9,000 spectators. Lance Todd, who was to have such an influence at the Willows 20 years later, was in the New Zealanders&#x27; side. A year later, the Australians stopped off at the Willows on 17 October. The result was a 9–9 draw.
Salford won the Rugby Football League Championship in 1913–14. The club had financial problems and was in the hands of the official receiver but somehow in the Championship final, beat Huddersfield&#x27;s &quot;Team of All Talents&quot; 5–3 on 25 April 1914, this was the club&#x27;s first major honour.
In August 1914, the Salford Football Club Company was finally wound up and a new company, Salford Football Club (1914) Limited was formed. During the First World War, Salford continued to function, but it was a struggle. Thirty-two Salford players volunteered for the war, of which seven were killed.
The 1920s was an era of survival, on and off the field, the team opening the decade with their worst ever league placing, finishing last in 1920–21. There was a dramatic change of fortune during the summer of 1928 when Lance Todd became team manager. In his first season in charge (1928–29), &quot;Toddy&#x27;s Toddlers&quot; went from 26th to fourth place in the table with virtually the same set of players.

Gus Risman was talent-spotted by Lance Todd, when he was 17 years old. He made his début for Salford on 31 August 1929. Other legendary names included Alan Edwards, Jack Feetham, Barney Hudson, Emlyn Jenkins, Billy Watkins and Billy Williams.
Salford were considered the leading club in the game during the 1930s, winning three League Championships, five Lancashire League Championships, four Lancashire Cups and the Rugby League Challenge Cup.
Salford won the Lancashire Cup for the first time in 1931 by beating Swinton 10–8 at the Cliff in front of a crowd of 26,471. Having been runners-up in the same competition in 1929 it was their first trophy for 17 years.
Salford captured the Rugby League Championship in 1933 by beating Swinton 15–5 in the final at Central Park, Wigan.
Salford were the first club to be invited to tour France who saw them as the premier side in the game. Their trip in October and November 1934 was to promote rugby league in the country. They won all six matches in spectacular fashion and were given their unofficial nickname; &quot;Les Diables Rouges&quot; (The Red Devils) by French journalists. The opening game was in Paris on Sunday 21 October, following an overnight ferry journey, having beaten Wigan 21–12 in the Lancashire Cup final the previous afternoon.

Salford turned its attention to baseball during the summer of 1935 as members of the National Baseball League. Matches were staged at the Willows. Several of Salford&#x27;s players took part including Gus Risman. The team was called the &quot;Salford Reds&quot;.
In 1936, for a third consecutive year, Salford won the Lancashire Cup, defeating Wigan 5–2 at Wilderspool, Warrington.
Salford&#x27;s highest attendance was set on 13 February 1937 when 26,470 turned up to watch Salford versus Warrington in the first round of the Rugby League Challenge Cup. The 1937 Australian touring team was beaten by Salford 11–8 at the Willows. Despite heavy rain that created muddy playing conditions, 12,000 attended.
Salford beat Barrow 7–4 in the final of the 1938 Challenge Cup at Wembley, the club&#x27;s first-ever win. A famous photograph was taken of Gus Risman and the cup being carried shoulder-high round the stadium by his teammates with him being the only one without a cigarette in his hand.
In 1939, Salford became the first rugby league club to make successive visits to Wembley but were well beaten 20–3 by Halifax. On 3 September 1939, the Second World War began and the 1939–40 season was abandoned. A wartime Emergency League was organised but, at the beginning of January 1941, Salford decided to cease playing, due to poor gates. In November 1942, Lance Todd was killed in a car crash.

===Post-war===
On 25 August 1945, Salford played their first match after the war against Castleford, winning 10–0 at the Willows. Hundreds of supporters gave up their summer weekends to help put the derelict looking ground back into good order.
In 1946, Salford appeared to be on their way to a third consecutive peacetime final, but Salford lost, unexpectedly, at home to Hunslet (15–8) at the quarter-final stage. In the second post-war season, 1946–47, Salford slid to twenty-second, a dramatic climb followed and the team finished seventh in 1948–49, and fifth in 1949–50. But it was a false dawn and the team fell into mid-table obscurity during the 1950s.
In 1950, Salford finished fifth on scoring difference to miss out on a top-4 play-off spot but it was their highest post-war finish until 1973–74.
Salford lost 4–8 to Warrington in a third-round Challenge Cup tie on 17 March 1951 at the Willows. The crowd was reported in the press as 28,000, the upper limit that had been set for the match. If correct it would be a ground record, but no official figure survives to confirm the exact attendance.

Salford won a four-team summer competition at Stanley Park in Blackpool 1952. Staged as part of Blackpool Corporation&#x27;s Festival of Sport Fortnight, the Reds eliminated Barrow in the semi-final and then defeated Doncaster 26–7 in the final.
When Gus Risman quit as a player in 1954, he coached Salford for four years, before moving temporarily to Phoenix, Arizona (USA) to care for his nephew who had recently been involved in a dog mauling incident.
Saturday 26 November 1955 saw television cameras at the Willows for the first time when the second half of the match against New Zealand was broadcast live on BBC Grandstand.
Salford hosted their first floodlit game, using Manchester United&#x27;s ground on Wednesday 5 November 1958 against Leeds in a match postponed from October. Leeds won 22–17.

A proposal in 1960 to create a Manchester rugby league club at the former White City Stadium on Chester Road received strong opposition from Salford and Swinton. Their protests were renewed when a match was staged there between a Manchester XIII, drawn from both Salford and Swinton and the New Zealand tourists in September 1961 and the idea was subsequently dropped.
Gus Risman returned to Salford as team manager in February 1962.
Between March and September 1962, Salford hit an all-time low with 19 consecutive defeats. Covering two seasons, it is the worst run in the club&#x27;s history. Salford also suffered what was then their largest margin of defeat, when they lost 59–0 at St. Helens.

===Brian Snape era===
Brian Snape succeeded Jim Hammond as chairman in September 1963. Snape appointed Griff Jenkins as secretary-coach in 1964, and the Reds immediately started to climb the league ladder.
Salford built a variety club in 1966 in a bid to attract couples and parties to attend rugby matches. Between 1967 and 1972, Salford averaged over 7,000 spectators at a time when the league average was slipping below 2,000. In June 1967 the Willows switched on its floodlights for the first time in the match with Widnes on Friday 11 March 1966. From that evening, Friday night was rugby league night as the fans flocked to the Willows.
In October 1967 David Watkins joined Salford for £15,000, a then club record. Watkins scored in 92 consecutive matches for Salford from 19 August 1972 to 25 April 1974. He totalled 929 points from 41 tries and 403 goals.
In 1967, the Rugby Football League gave permission for games to be played on Sunday for the first time. The Willows staged its first Sunday fixture, a friendly with French club, Cavaillon, on 5 May 1968. It was not until the following season that the Reds were at home in their first competitive Sunday match, a second-round Challenge Cup-tie against Workington Town on 23 February 1969, Salford winning 12–5, destined for their third Wembley final which they lost 11–6 to Castleford, it was their first visit to Wembley after a gap of 30 years.

Salford&#x27;s red devil nickname was immortalized when local football team Manchester United decided to replace their &quot;Busby&#x27;s Babes&quot; nickname following the Munich crash. Matt Busby liked the sound of &quot;Red Devils&quot;, thinking a devil was more intimidating to opponents than angelic babes and Manchester United adopted the &quot;Red Devils&quot; nickname.
In 1969, the BBC documentary, &quot;the Game That Got Away&quot;, held up Salford&#x27;s revenue model as a blueprint for other clubs to follow.
In 1971, Salford beat the New Zealand tourists for the first time after five previous defeats.
In October 1972, Salford reached the final of the Lancashire Cup for the first time since 1938, beating Swinton 25–11 at Wilderspool, Warrington to win their first trophy in thirty-three years. Salford reached the next three Lancashire Cup finals but failed to recapture the cup in any of them. They were also runners-up to Leeds in the 1972–73 Players No.6 Trophy. In 1973–74 and 1975–76 the club claimed two Championships and won the 1974–75 BBC2 Floodlit Trophy. The 1974 Championship was their first since 1938–39.

Salford&#x27;s last major final of the Brian Snape era was the 1976 Premiership Trophy decider played at Station Road, Swinton. Salford conceded three tries in the last 12 minutes to lose 15–2. As the 1970s drew to a close, many star players had retired or were approaching the veteran stage, with no funds available to replace them.
In the 1976–77 season, the Salford versus Leeds match was abandoned just after half-time, after Chris Sanderson of Leeds suffered a fatal injury, after 38 minutes. Leeds were ahead 5–2, but the game was declared null and void and not replayed.
Stan McCormick was coach between February 1978 and March 1978. At the end of the 1977–78 season, Brian Snape left Salford, handing over the reins to his brother Keith.

===Post-Snape era===
In May 1978, Alex Murphy was a surprise appointment as Salford coach. Years earlier he had famously referred to Salford&#x27;s expensively built team as the &#x27;Quality Street Gang&#x27;.
Salford&#x27;s home league fixture with Widnes was designated as the club&#x27;s &#x27;Centenary Match&#x27; in October 1979. Watched by 11,982, the result was 16–16, Salford playing in their original jersey colours of red, amber and black hoops. In fact Salford was founded in 1873 as Cavendish, changing their name to Salford in 1879. Alex Murphy left in November 1980, he was replaced by Kevin Ashcroft.
By the end of the 1970s, the variety centre was losing money and in 1980, it was sold to the brewery Greenall Whitley. In 1981, Salford reverted to playing on Sunday afternoons.
On 3 January 1982, John Wilkinson took over as chairman. Wilkinson inherited a club living above its income, forcing him to make cost-saving measures. Mike Coulman coached Salford for the 1983–84 season.
Between July–August 1986, Salford participated in an 8-a-side touch rugby competition that included most of the senior clubs. The Reds won after beating Featherstone Rovers in the final at Elland Road, Leeds.

While the books were being balanced, steady progress was made on it, the Reds pulling off a major coup with the signing of Australian full-back Garry Jack in 1988. The Lancashire Cup final was reached in 1988, the Reds losing narrowly to favourites Wigan.
Kevin Tamati became coach in 1989. 1990 turned out to be a golden year. Salford won the Second Division Championship, losing just one game all season. In the Premiership final in front of 50,000 at Old Trafford, the Red Devils beat Halifax 27–20. They also made the final of the Lancashire Cup, losing narrowly to favourites Widnes.
In 1993 Garry Jack became head coach and manager as Tamati left. Jack was relieved from the coaching duties before being sacked as club manager in early 1995.

===Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. Andy Gregory had finished his playing days as player-coach at Salford in 1995. Salford finished with 21 points; six-points clear of Hull F.C. and seemingly safe from a drop into the lower leagues. However, the Rupert Murdoch-funded Super League competition proposed, as part of the deal, that some traditional clubs would merge. Salford were to merge with Oldham to form a &quot;Manchester&quot; club that would compete in Super League. When Salford visited Oldham for a match on Good Friday, 14 April, supporters of both clubs demonstrated against the idea by invading the pitch during the interval. This merger was resisted but Salford were not included in the new competition.

Salford added Reds to their name for the 1995–96 season. In 1996 Salford beat Wigan 26–16 at the Willows to produce one of the Challenge Cup&#x27;s biggest shocks. It brought to an end a record run of eight successive Wembley victories by Wigan. Salford went on to reclaim their place in Super League by edging out Keighley to win the First Division.
Gregory left Salford by mutual consent in May 1999 to concentrate on his pub business in Wigan. John Harvey replaced him as head coach. Salford Reds became &quot;Salford City Reds&quot; in 1999 reportedly because Salford Council wanted their financial support for the club to be recognised, so their name was changed to emphasise the city status of Salford. The club&#x27;s first match as Salford City Reds took place against Gateshead at the Willows on 18 July 1999. After the club avoided relegation at the end of the 1999 season, Harvey was given a contract for a further season. He resigned in July 2001 following a 70–4 defeat at Wigan.

Steve McCormack became the youngest Super League coach at the age of just 28 in 2001 but was sacked just 10 months later, after winning only three of 20 games. He was replaced by Karl Harrison, who had been Assistant Coach to Brian Noble at Bradford Bulls.
Salford City Reds struggled in the 2002 season and Harrison was unable to keep the club in the Super League, despite a good end to the season. Indeed, they went into the final match of the season second from bottom (only the bottom club were relegated that season). However, a home defeat by Castleford, coupled with a home win for Wakefield Trinity over Warrington, resulted in relegation for the Reds.
The 2003 season was spent in the National League 1, where the Reds – remaining as a full-time club (most other National League One teams were part-time or amateur clubs) – performed very well, losing only 2 games all season. Salford won 90–8 at Gateshead, their highest score since 1907 and then four days later Salford beat Gateshead again 100–12 in the National Cup at the Willows, a club record score. On their way to finishing top of the National League 1 table, Salford also won the Arriva Trains Cup beating Leigh in the final. Having finished on top of the National League One table, Salford entered the National League One play-offs, needing to win their match to qualify for the final. They beat Leigh in a bad-tempered match, to qualify for the National League One Grand Final. Leigh were forced into a knock-out semi-final to try to get through to the Grand Final – a play-off match they ultimately won.

Salford City Reds then comfortably beat Leigh in the Grand Final, to gain promotion to Super League after one season out. It was the sixth time out of seven meetings between the two that Salford had beaten Leigh that season (the first match ended in a draw). Leigh would follow Salford into Super League the following season. 2004 was a consolidatory season for the Reds, notably mostly for an impressive home win over St. Helens and coming from 12 points behind Castleford in a game three times in the season to win all three games, the third of which – at Castleford&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle&quot; ground confirmed Salford&#x27;s survival in the Super League and practically relegated &#x27;Cas&#x27; in the process. In the end the Reds finished 9th.
The 2005 season saw Salford Reds sign Luke Robinson and David Hodgson from Wigan, both of whom performed excellently well for the Reds all season. Although Salford were unable to improve on the 9th-place finish of the previous season, they were regarded as one of the most improved teams in Super League and finished 6-points higher than they had the season before. However, relegation was again a real threat, as – to accommodate Catalans Dragons from France into Super League in 2006 – two clubs were relegated in 2005 instead of just one. Leigh comfortably finished bottom of the table, losing 14 games in a row. Widnes were also relegated, 6-points behind the Reds.

The 2006 Season started with wins at Warrington, and against Catalans Dragons at the Willows. Further wins over Wigan and Wakefield Trinity meant that Salford had won 4 of their opening 5 games (losing to Bradford in round 3). Salford in SLXI lost eight games by fewer than 6 points, including 1 point defeats to Leeds, Hull F.C. and Harlequins RL and 2 point defeats to Leeds and St. Helens. However, Salford&#x27;s victory over Castleford on 10 September 2006, ensured that they would play in the Super League play-offs for the first time in their history in a season they had started as favourites for relegation according to most pundits. It is the club&#x27;s highest position in a top division since coming fourth in 1979–80 in the old First Division. In their first-ever Super League play-off match, Salford City Reds were routed 52–6 at Odsal Stadium against Bradford on Saturday 23 September 2006.

Karl Harrison was sacked as first-team coach on 22 May 2007 following a disastrous run of form that saw the Reds win just three games and draw another in the opening 16 rounds of the 2007 Season, and left them languishing at the bottom of the League Table with a meagre 7 points. Team Director of Football, Steve Simms took over in a caretaker role for two games, winning the first against an in-form Huddersfield and only losing by a single point against then World Champions, St. Helens.

On 11 June 2007 long-term favourite to take the role, Shaun McRae was announced as the new head coach. On 15 June 2007, Salford beat Harlequins 5–2 in the first and until 13 February 2025, the only Super League game not to contain a try. On 2 September 2007, Salford were relegated from Super League when Hull Kingston Rovers beat Hull F.C. 42–6.

===Super League licence era and move to Barton===
McRae led the Salford side to triple success in the National League, winning the Northern Rail Cup, the League Leaders&#x27; Trophy and the Grand Final. Salford City Reds were awarded a three-year Super League licence in July 2008 as the game moved away from automatic promotion and relegation.
The Reds beat Leeds at Headingley 30–20 in 2009 to produce one of the biggest surprises of the season. Salford had only defeated Leeds away twice since 1946, the last occasion being 1977.
Shaun McRae was off ill with an undisclosed illness for most of the 2011 season, assistant coach Phil Veivers was caretaker manager and was promoted to head coach in November 2011.

The Reds were awarded a three-year licence to compete in the Super League from 2012 to 2014. They finished the 2011 Super League XVI season in 11th place.
In 2012, the club left the Willows to move into the new Salford City Stadium at Barton, Eccles. Their first league match at the new stadium was on 4 February 2012 against Castleford, who beat Reds 10–24. They finished the 2012 Super League XVII season in 11th place again.

In January 2013, the hearing of a winding-up petition over money Salford owed to HM Revenue and Customs and to players in unpaid wages was adjourned for four weeks so that new investors in the club could be sought. It was indicated that the club could be taken over by Marwan Koukash. On 31 January 2013 it was confirmed that Koukash would take over the club. Phil Veivers was sacked as coach in March 2013 after Salford lost four of their first five games, with Alan Hunte taking temporary charge until former Bradford, Great Britain and Crusaders coach Brian Noble was revealed as the new coach.

===2013–2024: Salford Red Devils===
Salford signed eight more players and relaunched as Red Devils on 5 September 2013, including former Castleford star halfback and international Rangi Chase, and fellow England player Gareth Hock. The former Warrington captain Adrian Morley, ex-Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s Tim Smith, and Samoa internationals Francis Meli and Tony Puletua, both formerly of St. Helens, complete the signings from Super League teams. Signings from the Australian NRL were the former Parramatta Eels fullback Jake Mullaney, ex-Melbourne Storm centre Junior Sa&#x27;u and Steve Rapira, previously of New Zealand Warriors. Also signed were former Salford Academy product, Jason Walton and Greg Johnson, both from Championship side Batley.

It was confirmed in early April 2014 that Iestyn Harris, a former assistant coach at rival Super League club Wigan, would become the new head coach of Salford. Owner Marwan Koukash had been in talks with Wigan to negotiate bringing Harris to the AJ Bell Stadium but did not state his prospective role to the public. Former Salford Head Coach Brian Noble has been offered the job of Director of Football after being dismissed from his position as head coach after a mediocre start to his first full season in charge.

In 2014, it was revealed that Salford mayor Ian Stewart lent almost £200,000 to the club to keep them afloat, without consulting others at the council. Salford City Council also part-own the stadium where the club play.
In September 2015, four players, Rangi Chase, captain Harrison Hansen, Cory Paterson and Théo Fages, were released by the club by new Director of Rugby and Australian national team coach Tim Sheens.

In 2015, Salford failed to finish in the top 8 of Super League and ended up in The Qualifiers. In 2015, they finished 3rd in the table and secured Super League status for the 2016 season.

In 2016, Salford managed enough wins to finish in the top 8 of Super League, but breaches of the Salary Cap in 2014 and 2015 saw them deducted 6 points and the finished the season 10th and they were placed in The Qualifiers again. Here, they suffered numerous losses, including to the London Broncos and Leigh Centurions, who had both been in the Championship that season and could only finish 5th in the Qualifiers table. This meant they ended up in the 2016 Million Pound Game away to Hull Kingston Rovers. Despite not being in front in the entire 80 minutes, Salford scored two unconverted tries in the last 90 seconds of normal time to take the game to Golden Point extra time. Less than a minute into the extra time, Salford scored a Drop Goal to win the match and secure Super League status for 2017.

In 2018, Salford finished second last in the table and were condemned to play in the 2018 Rugby League Qualifiers. Salford managed to avoid relegation to the RFL Championship after finishing top of the qualifiers table and secured their place for the 2019 Super League season.

In 2019, Salford reached the 2019 Super League Grand Final after defeating Castleford and Wigan to reach the decider. Salford were looking to win their first championship since 1976 but faced a St Helens side who had only lost 3 games all season. Salford would go on to lose the final 23–6 at Old Trafford.

The 2020 season was heavily affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and, following the departure of the Toronto Wolfpack from Super League, several teams – including Salford – had results annulled. The league campaign was disappointing, but Salford did manage to reach the 2020 Challenge Cup Final, the first time they had reached the Wembley showpiece since the 1968–69 Challenge Cup. Unfortunately for Salford, a late drop goal from Luke Gale won the Challenge Cup for the Leeds Rhinos by 17–16. At the end of the 2020 season, Head Coach, Ian Watson, left the club leaving the Red Devils &quot;surprised and disappointed by [the] decision&quot; in order to take up the role of Head Coach at the Huddersfield Giants.

On 18 December 2020 it was announced that Salford had been fined £15,000 (half of it suspended) for failing to fulfil a fixture v Warrington Wolves in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic; Salford had informed the RFL that they had only 13 players available for selection.

Salford finished the 2021 Super League season in 11th place on the table after a disastrous campaign which included an embarrassing loss against Leigh who had lost their previous 16 matches in a row. On 22 September 2021, Richard Marshall who had only been appointed head coach at the start of the year, left the club by mutual consent.

Salford started the 2022 Super League season poorly winning only three of their first ten matches. After their round 15 loss to Wigan, Salford were sitting 10th place on the table. In round 16, Salford recorded one of the biggest wins in their history defeating Wakefield Trinity 74–10. The victory started Salford on a winning run as they recorded eight wins in the next eleven games including a 44–12 win over St Helens RFC. Salford would finish the regular season in 6th place and qualify for the playoffs. In the elimination playoff, Salford would upset Huddersfield 28–0. In the semi-final, Salford would lose controversially to St Helens 19–12. With less than ten minutes remaining, Salford were not awarded a penalty try after it appeared Tommy Makinson took out Salford&#x27;s Tim Lafai in the act of scoring a try. Makinson was sin binned for a professional foul and the referee stated he was not convinced Lafai would have grounded the ball.

Salford finished the 2023 Super League season in 7th place, missing the playoffs by two competition points.

===2024-present: Financial difficulties===

In the 2024 Super League season, Salford finished 4th on the table and qualified for the playoffs. They were eliminated in the first week of the playoffs by Leigh. Following the conclusion of the season, it was revealed that Salford had finished in the lowest place for Super League teams in the IMG gradings.

In November, financial issues caused Salford to request an advancement on their central funding for the 2025 Super League season, which was granted by a ballot of the other Super League clubs. Salford&#x27;s financial issues continued through the off season. In January, three weeks before the start if the season, the RFL ordered a player sale at the club, reducing their sustainability cap to £1.2 million.

On 7 February 2025, Salford were bought out by a consortium led by businessman Dario Berta. In their first Super League fixture of the year against St Helens at the Totally Wicked Stadium, as a result of salary cap restrictions, Salford controversially fielded a squad of only 16 players, with only three senior squad members - Joe Bullock, Tiaki Chan and Ben Hellewell - present as substitutes, the remainder filled with Salford&#x27;s reserves. The match, which aired on BBC Two, ended 82-0, the highest Super League winning margin since Salford were beaten 92-12 by the Bradford Bulls in June 2000. A compliance investigation was launched by the RFL on the Monday following the game.

==Colours and badge==
===Colours===

Salford have traditionally played in predominantly red with bits of white. When the club was rebranded as the Red Devils the club colours were changed slightly with black replacing the small amount of white that appears on the home kit.

===Badge===
Traditionally Salford used the city&#x27;s coat of arms as many other clubs did until the Super League era started in 1996 and many clubs rebranded. Salford City as they were then known added Reds to their name and a new logo. In 2013 the club rebranded again becoming the Salford Red Devils. In 2017 a new club crest was introduced, the centrepiece of the new design is the willow tree, symbolising the club&#x27;s spiritual home and indeed the city – the name Salford was initially derived from Sealhford, meaning a ford by the willow trees. The devil&#x27;s trident adorns the top of the crest, while there are also five workers bees, included to represent the five industrial communities that grew around the centre of the textile industry in the area. There is a nod to the rivers and canals which were the lifeblood of the region during the industrial revolution and the Lowry Millennium footbridge in Salford Quays. In November 2020, the club reverted to a logo featuring the Devil.

==Stadiums==
===1879–1901: New Barnes===
Salford&#x27;s original ground was at New Barnes (sometimes spelt New Barns) on ground on the north side of Manchester Racecourse (). The club&#x27;s first game in the Northern Union was played at this ground on 5 September 1896. In 1901 the club was forced to leave as the ground and racecourse had been purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal company for expansion of the dock area. The last game at New Barnes was on 30 November 1901.

===1901–2011: The Willows===
In 1900, Salford agreed a 14-year lease on of land belonging to the Willows Estate Company, named after the abundance of willow trees in the area. They made their debut at the Willows on 21 December 1901, beating Swinton 2–0 in front of 16,981 fans. In the 1960s, the terrace was flattened at the Willows Road end to make way for the Salford Football and Social Club which was officially opened on 16 June 1966. The Willows switched on its floodlights for the first time in the match with Widnes on Friday 11 March 1966. On 26 November 1989, Salford unveiled a new £50,000 electronic scoreboard above the Willows Variety Centre. 

===2012–present: Salford Community Stadium===
From the start of the 2012 season, Salford have played at the purpose-built Salford Community Stadium in Barton-upon-Irwell, co-owned by Peel Holdings and Salford City Council and shared with rugby union side Sale Sharks. From 2013 to 2023 the stadium was named the AJ Bell Stadium due to a naming rights deal with financial services company AJ Bell. In 2015 Salford were in talks with a landowner in Salford about building a new stadium in Salford because of rent low attendances since the current stadium is in Salford, although nothing came from these talks.

==Cultural references==
A 1928 oil painting by the Salford-born artist L. S. Lowry, entitled &quot;Going to the Match&quot;, is a depiction of rugby league fans walking to a match. It is thought that the blue and red scarves worn by fans in the crowd and the red flag flying by the rugby ground indicate that this was a match played by Salford against Swinton. The painting was displayed at a 2012 exhibition in The Lowry, before being auctioned at Sotheby&#x27;s, and it is now in a private collection.

<text>Leigh Leopards are a professional rugby league club based in Leigh, Greater Manchester, England. Leigh play homes games at Leigh Sports Village and compete in Super League, the top tier of British rugby league.

Leigh Leopards have won the League Championship twice and Challenge Cup three times.

The clubs traditional home colours are red and white. They have a local rivalry with Wigan Warriors.

==History==
===1878–1915: Early history===
Leigh RFC was founded in 1878 by a surveyor named Fred Ulph. Leigh&#x27;s first practice match was on 5 October 1878 at Buck&#x27;s Farm in Pennington and their first game was against Eccles two weeks later.

In 1879, the club moved to a field behind the Three Crowns in Bedford and played there for 10 years. Leigh came to the attention of the wider district in 1885 when they had a 23 match unbeaten run with 21 wins and 2 draws. As attendances grew, improvements were made to the ground and the field&#x27;s slope was levelled.

The club moved to Frog Hall Field, later known as Mather Lane, in 1889. The pitch was drained and levelled, a 10-foot-high hoarding was built around the ground, and a 500-seater stand was erected. The first game at Mather Lane was played on 7 September 1889 against Aspull and Leigh forward James Pendlebury scored the first try in front of a 2,000 crowd.

The 1894–95 season saw a new stand open on the south side in a momentous year for Rugby football. Leigh, along with Salford and Wigan, was suspended for professionalism by the Rugby Football Union, and placed joint bottom of the Lancashire league. With automatic promotion and relegation, it faced dropping down a division, and potential financial ruin. On top of years of arguments with the Rugby Football Union concerning player expenses, 22 teams including Leigh decided to form a breakaway governing body – the Northern Union.

The first season of the new game kicked off in September with Leigh recording a 6–3 loss against Leeds. Leigh finished ninth that season. Leigh had a great start in the new Union, they played well and the crowds increased; however they had mixed fortunes over the next few years. As the new century began, Leigh struggled and despite winning the West Lancashire and Border Towns Cup, the crowds and their fortunes dropped dramatically.

In the 1904–05 season, there was a dispute with Wigan in the Challenge Cup game. The game was played on 4 March 1905 and Leigh won 3–0 in front of 13,000 spectators. The Northern Union, after being alerted by Wigan, alleged that Leigh player Dick Silcock had played illegally after being absent from work in the week before the game without a permit breaking the &#x27;working clause&#x27;. Leigh was found guilty of fielding an ineligible player and ordered to replay without expenses and for Leigh the gate receipts to be given to the Northern Union. Wigan won the replay 5–0 and Leigh were so incensed that the club considered leaving the Northern Union and starting an Association football club. Leigh became a limited company as a result of this financial blow.

In 1906, Leigh were Northern Union champions after a season with an 80% win rate. Many clubs complained that Leigh had provided themselves with an easy fixture list, ducking the challenge of the stronger clubs and play-offs were brought in.

In 1907–08, Leigh and Wigan were again in conflict in the Lancashire Cup. An attendance record was set when 17,000 spectators watched Leigh and Wigan draw 3–3 at Mather Lane. Leigh lost the replay at Central Park but appealed for another replay because a Wigan player had left the field during the game without the referee&#x27;s permission, Leigh lost the second replay.

In 1909, Mather Lane was upgraded when the embankment on the popular side was extended and raised giving the ground a capacity of 20,000 spectators. Around this time Leigh named its first coach – Jim Jolley. Over the next few years, Leigh had little success and crowd numbers dropped dramatically.

However, when the First World War began in summer 1914, the Northern Union believed that it would be over by Christmas and the season began as normal. Leigh performed poorly. Competitive rugby was suspended in 1915 until the hostilities ceased.

===Inter-war years===
Competitive rugby resumed in 1918 with an interim season from January to May. Leigh finished 2nd. Leigh had limited success just after the war and the Leigh directors set about building a new team. They had 19 players and even though their league performances were patchy, they had some success in the cups.
In the 1920–21 season, in a round of the Lancashire Cup in which Leigh played Rochdale Hornets, an attendance record was set at Mather Lane when a crowd of 21,500 saw Leigh win 9–7. Leigh reached the final but lost to Broughton Rangers. In 1921 the club won the Challenge Cup with a shock 13–0 victory over Halifax at the Cliff in Broughton, Salford. In 1934, Leigh played under floodlights for the first time, losing 8–25 at London Highfield. Leigh were the first Lancashire side to win the Challenge Cup since 1911.

Over the following seasons Leigh was quite successful in the league and cup. The club attracted huge crowds, and a Leigh v Wigan derby was guaranteed to draw in the spectators. One such meeting when Leigh met Wigan in the first round of the Challenge Cup in 1923–24, saw a crowd of 33,500 at Mather Lane. However, the 1920s, and 1930s were marred by strikes, unemployment and periods of economic depression. The government levied an entertainment tax of around 20% on gate receipts, at a time when clubs were experiencing difficulties balancing the books. For Leigh the mini-boom was over.

In 1924–25, Leigh slipped to 20th in the league and suffered a record 9–52 defeat in the league game at Central Park on Christmas Day. In December 1925 star player Abe Johnson was transferred to Oldham for £650 and Leigh&#x27;s decline continued the next season when they slipped to 4th from bottom in the league. The club lost every away match and suffered some heavy defeats as confidence left the team. 1926 was the year of the General Strike and Leigh admitted miners free of charge for many home games. Leigh had a decent season, finishing 7th in the league. Around this time, Mather Lane was improved including the construction of a covered terrace at one end, the doubling in size of the grandstand and an iron bridge was constructed across the canal to give the spectators easier access from the town centre.

Growing financial problems forced Leigh to sell players. In the 1930–31 season, the lack of experienced players had an effect on the field when Leigh won only one away game. The directors decided to ease the financial pressure by reducing players&#x27; wages. The players went on strike in response and Leigh were forced to play their reserves. The striking players eventually agreed to take a pay cut. Crowds fell to about 1,000 for home games and one midweek fixture against Swinton saw only 400 spectators. Leigh rallied briefly in 1931–32, encouraged by the return of Abe Johnson, but it didn&#x27;t last. In the 1932–33 season, things were so bad that the players played for free in several games. The club had major financial problems and a young inexperienced team. Financial support from an outside source was received which enabled the club to continue. Things went from bad to worse in the 1936–37 season when Leigh won only five games all season and finished third from bottom in the league. Gate receipts crashed to an all-time low, with the final home game of the season against Broughton Rangers attracting a crowd of around 250 spectators.

From the start of the next season, a new pay structure was agreed with the players, with each receiving £1 each per game. Leigh lost their best players and any new signings were juniors or free transfers from other clubs. The Rugby League Management Committee visited the club in March and two of its members were co-opted on to the Leigh board until the end of the season and the A-team was scrapped to cut costs. The 1937–38 season opened with some encouraging signs as Leigh beat Rochdale Hornets in the Lancashire Cup, their first win in any competition for 21 games. They took the touring Australians to within two points on the opening match of their tour. These were desperate times though and when Dewsbury visited Mather Lane for a mid-week game in November 1937, only 200 spectators were there to see Leigh suffer a record home defeat of 64–6. This prompted the Leigh directors to resign &quot;en masse&quot; and the Rugby League Management Committee stepped in to prevent the club from folding by guaranteeing their fixtures until the end of the season. The following February, a members club was formed, though the RFL stayed in control until June and Leigh won only one of their last 15 games, again finishing 3rd from bottom.

The club found itself without a ground in August 1940 when Callender&#x27;s Cable and Construction Company bought the Mather Lane site from the owners, Messrs. George Shaw &amp; Company Ltd of the Leigh Brewery. The new owners needed the ground to store steel drums and cases and they advised Leigh that they were unable to let them have a lease on the ground. Leigh&#x27;s last game at Mather Lane was a War Emergency League fixture against St Helens on 27 April 1940 where a crowd of only 300 spectators saw the visitors win 16–5. Leigh had intended playing in the 1941–42 Lancashire War Emergency League but weeks before the new season began, the Rugby Football League passed a resolution that clubs could only participate if they had a home ground. Leigh arranged to play at Hindsford Football Club&#x27;s ground but this was over-ruled by the RFL and Leigh ceased operations for the duration of the Second World War.

===Post-war===
In 1946–47, the Rugby Football League drew up the fixture list but Leigh&#x27;s name was omitted and it was only when local businessman James Hilton made a personal and impassioned plea to the Rugby Football League that Leigh were included. In January 1946, a public meeting at Leigh Liberal Club approved a motion to re-launch the club as &quot;Leigh RLFC&quot;. The club played the 1946–47 at Madeley Park, the home of Leigh Harriers &amp; Athletic Club. In 1947, the club moved to Kirkhall Lane headquarters and in 1953 floodlights were installed at a cost of £4,100. The ground saw a record home crowd of 31,326 attend a Challenge Cup tie with St. Helens in the same year. Later, Kirkhall Lane was officially renamed Hilton Park after James Hilton.

Leigh signed Jimmy Ledgard from Dewsbury in January 1948 for a then record fee of £2,650. Joe Egan joined Leigh for a record £5,000 fee in October 1950 and succeeded Emlyn Jenkins as player / coach. Leigh finished 4th in the league in his first season. In Egan&#x27;s second season, Leigh made it to the Lancashire Cup Final and a Challenge Cup semi-final as well as finishing 7th in the league. On Saturday 27 October 1951, 33,230 spectators saw Leigh lose 14–6 to Wigan in the final of the Lancashire Cup at Station Road, Swinton. The club repeated that league placing a year later, this time helping Leigh win the Lancashire Cup in front of a crowd of 34,785 at Swinton. The 14 March 1953 brought the biggest recorded crowd at Hilton Park when 31,326 crammed in to see St Helens win 12–3, to make up for their Lancashire Cup defeat.

In 1951, Leigh signed Australian rugby union test forward Rex Mossop. The tough man known as &quot;The Moose&quot; played three seasons with Leigh before returning to Sydney to play for his local club Manly-Warringah. Mossop became a dual-international when he was selected to play for Australia against the touring Great Britain side in 1958 and was the vice-captain to Welsh born Kangaroos captain Keith Barnes on the 1959–60 Kangaroo tour.

An injury to Egan saw him sit out the entire 1953–54 season and his absence hit Leigh hard and the club finished 13th and interest in cup competitions also finished early. Joe tried to make a comeback the following season but was forced to retire, although once more the club enjoyed runs in the cup competitions, losing to Barrow in the Lancashire Cup semi-final and then getting knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Featherstone. Joe Egan remained with the club as coach and the team was successful in his final season, finishing 11th but winning the Lancashire Cup for a second time with a resounding 26–9 success over Widnes.

Leigh and Bradford Northern were the first rugby league clubs to stage matches on a Sunday in December 1954, although there was opposition from the Sunday Observance lobby. The 1955–56 season saw the introduction of a tournament titled the ITV Rediffusion Cup. Eight clubs participated in a series of games played at football grounds in the London area, with Warrington eventually running out 43–18 victors over Leigh at Loftus Road.

===1971–1980: Alex Murphy era===

Alex Murphy joined Leigh as player-coach in 1966. In 1971, Leigh reached the Rugby League Challenge Cup Final and defeated Leeds, 24–7. Murphy left Leigh on 20 May 1971 to become player-coach at Warrington.

In 1978, John Woods played and scored in every game as Leigh secured the Second Division. In 1982, Leigh were Champions for the second time, as Alex Murphy guided them to a tense 13–4 victory at Whitehaven, after Leigh trailed 4–1 at half time.

===1981–1995: Relegation and ground moves===
The 1981–82 season was memorable as the club lifted the Lancashire Cup and ended the campaign as winners of the Championship for the second time in their history. Notable players during the season included John Woods, Des Drummond, Steve Donlan, and Alf Wilkinson.
Unfortunately Alex Murphy resigned at the end of the season to take over at Wigan, with Colin Clarke taking the reins at Leigh.

Leigh were relegated from First Division in 1985 but bounced back; winning the Second Division Championship in 1985–86, losing one league match. During the season, they twice broke the scoring record for most points in a game against Mansfield Marksmen (76–6) and Keighley (92–2).

Leigh were relegated from the First Division again in 1988 but again won the Second Division title to secure promotion at the first attempt.

Leigh relegated from First Division yet again in 1990 and crippling financial problems are revealed. For the 1990–91 season the club adopted the nickname &quot;the Bears&quot;, adding a bears emblem to the right breast of the club jerseys. The nickname was only used for one season and did not prove popular.

In January 1991, the club tried to sell its ground to ease cash problems. A consortium offered £200,000 to take over Leigh but the club ended up in administration. Swinton offered to ground share, Station Road, to help Leigh but this offer was refused. Tony Cottrell heads a consortium that takes over the club in 1991 and Alex Murphy is sacked on the eve of the new season.

Kevin Ashcroft takes over and guides the club to promotion behind Sheffield.

Steve Simms is appointed as the club&#x27;s first overseas coach in 1992. John Woods broke the club record for points scored in a game at Leigh&#x27;s home game against Ryedale-York in January 1992. In November 1992, Leigh get High Court reprieve following threat of eviction from Hilton Park. St. Helens inflict a new club record defeat with a whopping 64–9 win over Leigh at Knowsley Road. Leigh regain their form however with great wins at Wakefield Trinity, Hull and Sheffield; and finished the season with excellent results at home.

In February 1993, Leigh failed in a bid to buy back Hilton Park for £300,000 but in June, they were offered a reprieve and are allowed to stay for another 12 months. Leigh enter administration in July 1994.

In December 1994, Ian Lucas became head coach of Leigh, the youngest senior coach in the game. Despite victories over title chasing St Helens and Bradford, Leigh are relegated from the top division.

In 1995, the football club Horwich RMI made the decision to move from Horwich, near Bolton, to Hilton Park, changing their name to Leigh RMI in the process. As part of the deal a new company, Grundy Hill Estates, was formed to take over the ownership of the ground. Leigh added &quot;Centurions&quot; to their name for the 1995–96 season.

===1996–2011: Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. As the sport in Britain entered a new era, it was eight years before Leigh gained promotion to the top level of the game.

In April 1996, Eric Hughes was appointed head coach replacing Ian Lucas who was sacked after Leigh had won only one of its first five games of the season. Hughes was replaced by Keith Latham who was in charge until 1998. Norman Turley was head coach in 1998, Leigh finish bottom of the table with a succession of heavy defeats.

In October 1998 Ian Millward was appointed head coach. Under Millward, Leigh finish 4th in the Northern Ford Premiership. Millward left in 2000 to coach St. Helens.

Australian Paul Terzis was coach of Leigh from 1999 to 2003. His reign was notable for a number of &#x27;near misses&#x27; as Leigh attempted to win promotion to Super League. In 2000, Leigh made it through to the Grand Final before losing 13–12 to Dewsbury. In 2001 Leigh recorded a shock Challenge Cup victory over Super League Salford, finished 9 points clear at the top of the Northern Ford Premiership winning 26 from 28 league games and claimed the Trans-Pennine Cup. However, Leigh were defeated in the play-off semi-finals and Widnes went on to win the Grand Final and a place in Super League.

In 2002 and 2003, the relegated Super League sides, Huddersfield and Salford remained fully professional teams. Thus, their full-time fitness and coaching led to defeat in successive grand finals for Leigh. A consortium saved Leigh from administration on the eve of the 2003 season. Towards the end of the 2003 season Paul Terzis was sacked.

In October 2003, Darren Abram was appointed head coach, with a view to taking them into Super League. When Halifax were relegated to play in the 2004 National League competition, their financial troubles meant they were unable to retain a full-time team and struggled, paving the way for Leigh to go about achieving their dream. Whitehaven were the opponents when Leigh won the National League One Grand Final 32–16 (after extra time, 16–16 at full-time) in 2004, thus securing promotion to Super League.
Leigh&#x27;s Super League season of 2005 proved a disaster and the club were relegated to National League One after winning just two games. Abram resigned in August 2005 after a disagreement with the board, who felt unable to offer him the full-time contract he wanted for 2006 if the club were not in Super League. Tommy Martyn and Heath Cruckshank both try their hand at the job before Tony Benson was appointed head coach in September 2005. Leigh&#x27;s relegation from Super League had been all but confirmed at the time of his appointment.

In July 2006, Leigh won the Northern Rail Cup after defeating Hull Kingston Rovers 22–18 at Bloomfield Road, Blackpool. It was the second time the club had won that particular trophy having also triumphed in the 2004 final against the same opposition. A loss to Batley in the play-offs signals the end of Tony Benson&#x27;s reign.

Following Leigh&#x27;s 23–22 defeat by Batley Bulldogs in the 2006 National League One playoffs, the club&#x27;s future was thrown into doubt. The club&#x27;s owners decided to part company with Tony Benson causing some of the back room staff and management to resign in support of their colleague. The uncertainty also caused a number of the club&#x27;s playing staff to leave.

Darren Shaw was appointed as coach of the club in October 2006, however, it was found that Darren Shaw did not have the necessary qualifications to coach at this level and he was moved to the position of Football Manager, while assistant coach Paul Rowley was appointed as First Team Coach.

In January 2007, the club announced it would drop the Centurions name ahead of its move to a new stadium at Leigh Sports Village. The club changed the name of its stadium back to Hilton Park after renaming it the Coliseum a number of years earlier. However, due to an influx of letters, e-mails and telephone calls from Leigh supporters asking the club to re-think its decision; this decision was reversed in May.

Darren Shaw&#x27;s first full season in charge of Leigh ended with a 19–6 play off defeat away to Whitehaven. Leigh&#x27;s 2007 season was one dogged by inconsistency. Convincing wins were often followed by heavy defeats as Shaw was forced to field a number of youngsters due to injury problems. The unsettled nature of the side in 2007 was reflected by the fact that Shaw gave debuts to over 20 players over the course of the season.

Despite the disappointing end to the 2007 season, Shaw was given a contract to coach Leigh for the 2008 season. After a promising start to the 2008 season, Shaw tendered his resignation following defeats to Salford, Widnes and Featherstone Rovers. Darren Shaw was replaced by Neil Kelly.

Leigh move to the Leigh Sports Village in December and open the venue with a 4,600 crowd against Salford.

In April 2009, Neil Kelly took up the position of Director of Rugby at the club and his assistant Paul Rowley became head coach. Simon Knox became assistant coach. At the end of the 2009 season, despite winning a &#x27;must win&#x27; game at home to Whitehaven 47–14 other results went against Leigh and they were relegated to Championship 1. Leigh were reinstated into Co-operative Championship on 11 November 2009 after the RFL Board took the decision after Gateshead Thunder&#x27;s chairman Steve Garside wound up Gateshead and Newcastle Rugby Ltd.

Ian Millward returned as the club&#x27;s head coach for 2010, Leigh took advantage of their reprieve and had a terrific season, finishing in third place in the Co-Operative Championship before losing at home in the play-offs to Sheffield Eagles, whilst also reaching the semi-finals of the Northern Rail Cup before being knocked out by eventual winners Batley Bulldogs.

The 2011 season saw Leigh start as league pacesetters losing their first league game of the season in early June at home to Halifax. That defeat was more than made up for by defeating Halifax 20–16 in the final of the Northern Rail Cup at Blackpool&#x27;s Bloomfield Road on Sunday 17 July 2011 after a match-winning try in the final 30 seconds of a thrilling encounter from young centre Tom Armstrong. They finished the season well, finished 2n in the league, but they failed in the play-offs, losing to Featherstone Rovers in the qualifying final then losing to Sheffield Eagles in the final eliminator.

Ian Millward left his position as head coach at the end of the 2011 season to take over as head coach at Super League side Castleford Tigers. A new head coach has yet to be appointed (January 2012) with Paul Rowley and Neil Jukes currently in temporary charge of first team matters. Rowley was later appointed first team coach on a permanent basis in January 2012. After a successful first season in charge which included guiding the club to 2nd in the Championship and a Northern Rail Cup semi-final, Rowley was named Championship Coach of the year. In February 2013 Rowley signed a new contract at the club, which will keep him at the club until the end of 2015. Rowley resigned as Leigh Centurions head coach 10 days before the start of the 2016 Championship season, citing personal reasons.

===2012–2016: Super League bid===
In 2012 the club announced its intention to apply for a Super League licence. The club started the &#x27;We BeLEIGHve&#x27; campaign, believing that Leigh will be the club nominated by the Rugby Football League to be promoted to the Super League in 2014.

In the 2014 Kingstone Press Championship season, Leigh recorded the best season in the club&#x27;s history by going the entire season losing only two games; the first defeat coming at the hands of Leeds in the Challenge Cup, and the other coming at the hands of Doncaster. For their efforts, Leigh picked up the League Leader&#x27;s Shield and went on to win the Grand Final for the first time in 10 years, with a 36–12 victory over bitter rivals Featherstone Rovers.

In 2015 Leigh finished top of the Championship for the second year in a row and were one of the favourites to finish in the top three of the Qualifiers to gain automatic entry to Super League after they knocked Salford Red Devils and Wakefield Trinity out of the Challenge Cup earlier in the year. However they ended up finishing bottom of the Qualifiers after several close games and were confined to another season in the Championship.

In 2016 Leigh gained automatic promotion after winning their first 5 matches in the middle eight&#x27;s competition. The club were relegated after just one season back in the top division.

===2017–2022: Promotion and relegation===

It was announced on 14 December 2020 that Leigh would get the spare Super League place for the 2021 Super League season, left vacant after the Toronto Wolfpack withdrawal; Leigh beat five rival bids

Leigh started the 2021 Super League season poorly losing their opening eight matches. On 2 June 2021, it was announced that Leigh&#x27;s head coach John Duffy had parted ways with the club by mutual consent.

On 23 August 2021, Leigh recorded their first victory in the 2021 Super League season after losing the previous 16 matches in the competition beating Salford 32–22.
Despite that, they were already relegated from Super League. Leigh finished the season with only two wins from 22 matches.

===2022–present: Leopard Era and Challenge Cup win===

On 28 May 2022, Leigh reached the final of the 2022 RFL 1895 Cup against Featherstone winning the match 30–16. It was Leigh&#x27;s first triumph in the competition.

On 2 October Leigh defeated Batley in the Million Pound Game and won promotion back into Super League for the 2023 season. On 20 October 2022, Leigh Centurions changed its name to Leigh Leopards.
In round 3 of the 2023 Super League season, Leigh earned their first win back in the top flight defeating Hull Kingston Rovers 30–25.

On 22 July 2023 they beat St Helens in the Challenge Cup semi final by 12 points to 10 to reach the Challenge Cup final for the first time since 1971. On 12 August 2023, Leigh played in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley Stadium and beat Hull Kingston Rovers by 17–16 after golden point extra time. A drop goal by Lachlan Lam won the game and the cup for Leigh.
Leigh would finish 5th on the table in their first season back in the Super League to qualify for the playoffs. Leigh&#x27;s season was ended in the elimination final game against Hull Kingston Rovers as they lost 20-6.
In the 2024 Super League season, Leigh would finish 5th on the table for a second consecutive campaign. They would eventually reach the semi-final but fell one match short of the grand final losing to rivals Wigan 38-0.

==Stadium==
===1947–2007: Hilton Park===

In 1947, Leigh Rugby League Club moved to new headquarters in Kirkhall Lane, having played at &quot;Mather Lane&quot; before the Second World War and at &quot;Madeley Park&quot; (Leigh Harriers Athletic ground) immediately after the war. In 1953 floodlights were installed at a cost of £4,100. The ground saw a record home crowd of 31,326 attend a Rugby League Challenge Cup tie with St. Helens in the same year. Later, Kirkhall Lane was officially renamed Hilton Park after former club chairman Jack Hilton in recognition of his work in securing the site for the new ground.

In 1995, the association football club Horwich RMI relocated from the Grundy Hill Stadium, in Horwich to Hilton Park, changing its name to Leigh RMI in the process. As part of the deal a new company, &quot;Grundy Hill Estates&quot;, was formed to take over the ownership of the ground. Leigh added Centurions to its name for the 1995–96 season, and as part of the name change the stadium was renamed the &quot;Coliseum&quot;.

Leigh Centurions moved to Leigh Sports Village for the 2009–10 season. Hilton Park has since been demolished.

===2008–present: Leigh Sports Village===
Leigh moved into their new 12,500 capacity stadium, being made up of 10,000 seats, and a standing terrace of approximately 2,500 in late December 2008. The stadium forms part of the Leigh Sports Village complex was shared with Leigh Genesis football club. The old ground at Hilton Park has been demolished and the land sold for housing development. It was hoped that the new stadium would be the cornerstone of Leigh&#x27;s application for a Super League franchise in the coming years.

The first game to be played at Leigh Sports Village took place on 28 December 2008. The friendly match against Salford was held as a ramp up event in order for the stadium management company to gain a full safety certificate.

On Thursday 21 May 2009, Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visited the region to officially open Leigh Sports Village.

<doc id="1095969" wikidata="Q182815" url="?curid=1095969" title="The Glove">
<text>The Glove was a 1983 English musical collaboration and recording project by the Cure&#x27;s Robert Smith and Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; Steven Severin. They released one studio album, &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot;, in 1983 as part of Severin&#x27;s solo deal with Polydor. The latter came up with the band name, the album title and the blue/yellow sleeve concept, as Smith had to leave the project before completion due to prior commitments with the Cure.

==History==
Robert Smith and Steven Severin founded The Glove during a period when they were under heavy stress in their respective bands, the Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees.

In June 1982, Smith was on the verge of a breakdown, drained from the production of the Cure&#x27;s bleakest album, &quot;Pornography&quot; and its tour, substance abuse, and band infighting that led to the departure of bassist Simon Gallup. During summer 1982, Smith asked Severin to play bass on an early version of the Cure&#x27;s &quot;Lament&quot; for a single given to Flexipop magazine.

In October 1982, when playing two one-off shows in Madrid, Banshees guitarist John McGeoch had a nervous breakdown due to alcohol and the stresses of recording and touring, and was fired by the band returning home, shortly before the start of an important European tour. Smith was asked to fill in and officially became a member of the Banshees in November 1982. He had previously played live with the Banshees in 1979 on their &quot;Join Hands&quot; tour, when he replaced their guitarist John McKay, the latter had walked out at the start of the tour. The Cure had already been the support band, and Smith therefore had played two sets per night in September and October 1979.

Severin and Smith booked a studio in late 1982. The first song that they recorded was &quot;Punish Me with Kisses&quot;.

In January 1983, two months after Smith rejoined Siouxsie and the Banshees, Siouxsie Sioux and drummer Budgie left England to record an album on their own as the Creatures.

In March, after returning from a Siouxsie and the Banshees tour in Japan and Australasia, Severin and Smith appeared on television to perform live the Cure&#x27;s song &quot;Siamese Twins&quot;, for a ballet conceived by Nicholas Dixion for a UK television program called Riverside: cellists Anne Stephenson and Gini Hewes played with them. Both soon started to work on a project called the Glove. The band&#x27;s name referred to the enormous flying glove in the Beatles&#x27; 1968 animated movie &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;. Their album&#x27;s title, &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot;, referred to the horror film &quot;of the same name&quot;, in which people who took the fictional &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot; variety of LSD became psychotic murderers 10 years later. Smith described the recording sessions as &quot;unreal&quot;: &quot;We spent 12 weeks in the studio but actually recorded for about five days. The rest of the time was spent having an endless party to which we invited a succession of people. It was like a station -- once they got really out of it, they&#x27;d be moved on and the next batch brought in. In between all this we&#x27;d record a piece of piano or drum&quot;. During that period, the duo stayed up most of the nights watching &quot;video nasties&quot;, including Dario Argento films.

Since Smith was contractually prohibited from singing with another band (one of the reasons he cited for the 2001 split from the Cure&#x27;s longtime label), former Zoo dancer Jeanette Landray (a former girlfriend of Severin&#x27;s bandmate Budgie) was recruited as the lead singer. Smith sang on two of the songs, &quot;Perfect Murder&quot; and &quot;Mr. Alphabet Says&quot;. With the latter, Smith sang lyrics other than his own.

Other musicians involved in this project were Andy Anderson (who was about to become the new Cure drummer), Martin McCarrick (a musician of Marc Almond who later joined the Banshees), and strings players Ginny Hewes and Anne Stephenson. Smith, Severin and Landray promoted the album with a tv appearance on the show &quot;Riverside&quot; in October 1983.

In 2005, Severin proposed re-releasing &quot;Blue Sunshine&quot;. Smith, who had been gradually reissuing editions of the Cure&#x27;s back catalogue, agreed, and The Glove remaster was released as a 2-CD set on 8 August 2006 alongside three Cure re-releases. On the second disc, a dozen unreleased demo versions sung by Smith appeared for the first time. To commemorate Record Store Day 2013 a limited edition blue coloured vinyl version of the LP was produced.

<doc id="1095973" wikidata="Q3565244" url="?curid=1095973" title="Wakefield Trinity">
<text>Wakefield Trinityis a professional rugby league club in Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. The club play their home fixtures at the DIY Kitchen Stadium, Belle Vue and currently compete in the Super League, the top tier of the British rugby league system.

The club was one of the original twenty-two clubs that formed the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895. They have won the League Championship twice and Challenge Cup five times.

Wakefield have local rivalries with Castleford Tigers and Featherstone Rovers as well as Leeds Rhinos. Their traditional kit colours are white with a red or blue V. Between 1999 and 2016 the club was known as Wakefield Trinity Wildcats.

==History==

===Early years===

The club&#x27;s predecessor was The Young Mens Society, formed in 1867 by the Holy Trinity Church to promote sports, with the team itself formed in 1873 alongside a similarly named athletics club, Wakefield Trinity Cycling and Athletic Club (now Wakefield District Harriers and Athletics Club). Early matches were played at Heath Common (1873), Manor Field (1875–76) and Elm Street (1877) before the club moved to Belle Vue in 1879.

After the 1890–91 season, Wakefield along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge, Manningham decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs.

Prior to schism of 1895 which led to the formation of the Northern Rugby Union, Wakefield Trinity participated nine times in thirteen years in the final of the Yorkshire Cup (T&#x27;owd Tin Pot), a trophy that is nowadays contested solely by rugby union clubs.

They were one of the initial 22 clubs to form the Northern Union after the acrimonious split from the Rugby Football Union in 1895.

Belle Vue was purchased in 1895, in order to provide a permanent base for Trinity. The money was provided by the Wakefield Trinity Cycling and Athletic Club and was also initially used for cycling and athletics competitions. The athletic club split from the rugby club as a result of the split from the Rugby Football Union and in 1896 formed a separate limited company to avoid accusations of professionalism, although they continued to use Belle Vue until the 1920s.

Trinity won the Northern Union Challenge Cup for the first time in 1909, beating Hull F.C. 17–0 at Headingley. The corresponding 1914 final saw the result reversed, with Hull winning 6–0.

Jonty Parkin signed for Wakefield Trinity as a 17-year-old in 1913. Wakefield closed for the 1915–16 season but recommenced playing in 1916 following the introduction of conscription which meant that would not be accused of keeping men from volunteering for the First World War.

In a quiet time for Trinity, they won only one Yorkshire Cup (in 1924–25 against Batley) and lost four Yorkshire Cups.

Parkin decided he wanted to leave in 1930, at the age of thirty-four, and he was put on the transfer list at £100. Hull Kingston Rovers would not find the money; so Parkin paid the fee himself to secure his release. The game&#x27;s bylaws were adjusted shortly afterwards, so that no player could ever do that again.

On Saturday 27 October 1934, Leeds and Wakefield Trinity met in the final of the Yorkshire Cup at Crown Flatt, Dewsbury. The match ended in a 5–5 draw. Four days later the two clubs drew again, with Leeds eventually lifting the trophy after a second replay, the only occasion it took three attempts to settle a Yorkshire Cup Final. A total of 52,402 spectators watched the three games.

As of 2017, the 1943–44 season is the only occasion that Wakefield Trinity have finished top of the league.

In 1947, Wakefield Trinity centre Frank Townsend was fatally injured in a match at Post Office Road, Featherstone.

===Post-war===

On Saturday, 3 November 1945, Bradford Northern met Wakefield Trinity in the final of the Yorkshire Cup held at Thrum Hall, Halifax. Wakefield began the match as favourites, they had lost only one of thirteen matches thus far in the season. However, Bradford won 5–2 and lifted the Yorkshire Cup for the fourth time in six seasons. The first Wembley final after the war produced a return to winning ways as Trinity, with names such as James &quot;Jim&quot; Croston and Billy Stott, pipped Wigan to the Cup 13–12.

On Saturday 27 October 1951, 25,495 were at Fartown, Huddersfield to see Wakefield Trinity defeat Keighley 17–3 in the Yorkshire Cup Final. The club was not destined to return to Wembley until 1960 and had to slake its thirst for silverware on two Yorkshire Cup and two Yorkshire League victories in the 1950s. Trinity featured in the first league match to be broadcast on British television, a clash with Wigan at Central Park on 12 January 1952.

===1960s and 1970s===
Trinity were runners-up in the league championship in 1959–60, losing in the Championship Final against Wigan.

Wakefield Trinity beat Huddersfield 16–10 in the 1960 Yorkshire County Cup Final at Headingley, Leeds on 29 October 1960.

Wakefield returned to Wembley emphatically with a record 38–5 win v Hull F.C. under the guidance of coach Ken Traill and loose forward Derek &#x27;Rocky&#x27; Turner.

Wakefield won their fourth Challenge Cup victory in 1962, running out 12–6 winners against Huddersfield. Many of the scenes from the film &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; were filmed at the Belle Vue during Wakefield&#x27;s third round Challenge Cup match against Wigan. The club were victorious in a dour 1962 Challenge Cup win over Huddersfield although the Fartowners went on to deny them the double a few days later in the Championship final at Odsal Stadium, Bradford. Wakefield also won the Yorkshire Cup final of 1961–62 and the Yorkshire League of 1961–62.

Wakefield Trinity was invited to visit South Africa during June and July 1962. Neil Fox, Harold Poynton, Gerry Round, Derek Turner and Jack Wilkinson, were unable to accompany the team on the six-match tour, as they were in Australia with the GB tourists. Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s Chairman Stuart Hadfield was also touring with the national team as Great Britain manager. Trinity therefore added four South African players who were playing for British clubs at that time to their squad. They were Fred Griffiths (Wigan), Tom van Vollenhoven (St. Helens), Wilf Rosenberg (Hull F.C.) and Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Brophy (Leigh). Wakefield had three South Africans of their own in the squad in Alan Skene, Jan Prinsloo and Colin Greenwood, with the rest of the party made up of Fred Smith, Ken Hirst, Ken Rollin, Keith Holliday, Dennis Williamson, Milan Kosanović, Geoff Oakes, Brian Briggs, Albert Firth and Don Vines. They were winners of all six matches. The tour opened on Saturday 30 June 1962 at Milner Park, Johannesburg, where the local Johannesburg Celtic club were overpowered by 52–6.

Despite winning the Challenge Cup for a fifth time in 1963, Wakefield had still not been able to secure the league championship title. The Holy Grail would be achieved in the 1966–67 season when the experienced Harold Poynton led a powerful side, which included Neil Fox, Don Fox, Gary Cooper and Ray Owen, to victory over St. Helens in a replay of the championship final. They repeated the title feat the following year against Hull Kingston Rovers but were again denied the double when Leeds defeated them in the 1968 &#x27;water splash&#x27; final at Wembley, a match played during a downpour that saturated the pitch. The game produced the most dramatic of finishes, when Man-of-the-Match, Don Fox had an under-the-posts conversion to win it for Wakefield, but &quot;topped it&quot; on the saturated turf and missed, to leave Leeds 11–10 winners.

Trinity were crowned Champions for the only time in successive seasons – 1966–67 and 1967–68. Wakefield Trinity beat St. Helens 21–9 in the 1967 Rugby Football League Championship Final at Station Road, Swinton on 10 May 1967, with scrum half Ray Owen winning the Harry Sunderland Trophy. The following season they retained their title in the 17–10 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1968 Championship Final at Headingley on 4 May 1968, this time with Gary Cooper taking home the man of the match award. Wakefield now wear two gold stars above the club crest to signify the two titles won.

Wakefield absorbed a number of different coaches at the helm in subsequent years but did not return to Wembley until William &quot;Bill&quot; Kirkbride&#x27;s talented charges fell 12–3 to Widnes in 1979 in front of nearly 100,000 fans.

===1980s===
Bill Ashurst coached Wakefield Trinity while still playing during the 1981–82 season.

Derek Turner was Head Coach for Wakefield Trinity from July 1983 until February 1984. As of 2017, 11th in the Second Division during the 1984–85 season is the lowest position that Wakefield Trinity have ever finished. In December 1985, Wakefield did a deal with the local council to enable them to continue at Belle Vue. Five council delegates joined Wakefield&#x27;s board giving them the majority vote.

The ensuing decline was temporarily halted when Wally Lewis signed up for a brief spell with the club, playing as a . But Trinity continued to fluctuate between the two divisions.

Former player David Topliss stabilised the Dreadnoughts&#x27; ship in 1987. He won immediate promotion in 1988 back to the First Division, retiring as a player after the final match of the campaign. He remained at Wakefield purely as a coach and consolidated the club&#x27;s top tier status by acquiring the services of seasoned internationals like Steve Ella, new captain Mark Graham, Brian Jackson as well as now former Trinity coach Andy Kelly and later John Harbin.

Wakefield escaped a threat of closure by forming their first ever board of directors in August 1991. Topliss stepped down as coach to concentrate on his business. David Hobbs joined Wakefield Trinity as coach in May 1994. He then went to Halifax as Director of Football in January 1995.

===1996–1997: Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. When the Rupert Murdoch-funded Super League competition had been proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Wakefield were down to merge with Castleford and Featherstone Rovers to form a new club, &quot;Calder&quot;, which would compete in the newly formed Super League. Although Wakefield voted to merge, the other clubs refused to do so; Wakefield finished below the cut-off point of 10th in the existing top flight and were excluded from the new Super League. As the sport in Britain entered a new era, it would be three years before Wakefield rose again to the top level of the game.

=== 1998–2005: Entry to Super League ===
Under coach Andy Kelly, Wakefield earned their place in the top flight on the back of their controversial victory over Featherstone Rovers in the inaugural Division One Grand Final in 1998. Wakefield adopted the &quot;Wildcats&quot; nickname in 1998: the year they entered Super League, having won promotion from the first division.

Wakefield put together a startling series of results early in the 1999 season, beating some of the most fancied sides and ensuring early in the campaign that they would be safe. The club invested heavily in newcomers. Wakefield also played one of their televised home games at Barnsley F.C&#x27;s Oakwell stadium against St. Helens.

John Harbin was the coach of Wakefield between October 2000 and October 2001, Wakefield&#x27;s final game of the 2001 season was a relegation battle with Salford with Wakefield condemning Huddersfield to relegation. He decided to leave the club at the end of 2001.

Peter Roe was appointed Head Coach in November 2001. After years of struggling to keep up with the Super League pace which saw Trinity finish next to bottom on most of their attempts they finally got around to making headway up the league. Peter Roe was sacked in July 2002 and was replaced by his assistant Shane McNally. With Adrian Vowles as his co-coach the pair guided Trinity to their first-ever SL play-off position, finishing in 6th place.

In 2004, after a slow start to the season Trinity finished stronger than any other team in the competition giving their fans some hope of a little glory at the club which had been missing for too long. Away at the KC Stadium in Hull, Trinity produced a remarkable performance and managed to beat Hull despite having two men sin-binned.

The semis saw a visit to Wigan and there was real hope in the camp that Wakefield would make the elimination final play off and all looked to be going that way when Trinity led 14–0 but some strange decisions went the way of the Wiganers so it wasn&#x27;t yet to be but Wakefield fans will look back on these two games with fondness for many years. The away support was outstanding for both efforts.

Shane McNally was sacked in June 2005 after a disappointing start to the season. Tony Smith took over as caretaker coach from Shane McNally and led Trinity to survival in 2005 but following four straight defeats which saw Wakefield drop into the relegation zone Smith was sacked on Monday, 17 July 2006. Smith&#x27;s last game in charge was a 26–20 defeat against Huddersfield, a match in which his side squandered a 20-point lead – one of several occasions this season Trinity have collapsed in the second half.

On 24 July 2006, Wakefield announced former Hull F.C. coach John Kear as Head Coach until the end of the season.

Trinity defeated their arch-rivals Castleford by 29–17 at Belle Vue on Saturday 16 September 2006 to preserve their Super League status in an epic match which saw both teams leading for spells of the game. Had Wakefield not won the match they would have been relegated. Instead, their win, dubbed as the &#x27;Battle of Belle Vue&#x27; sent Castleford down to the National League One. The match was attended by a sell out crowd of 11,000.

In November 2006 the Wakefield Metropolitan District Council set out plans for a new sporting village to be built at Thornes Park that would incorporate a new stadium to be used by Trinity, along with gymnastics and boxing facilities and swimming pools. The council published results of a feasibility study on 12 September 2008, into the project and which concluded that it is not feasible for a new stadium at Thornes Park.

That left Wakefield Trinity in a precarious position – Belle Vue is not suitable for the long-term future, and a new stadium is crucial to their Super League survival. In 2009 a new stadium in Stanley was proposed with planning permission expected to be applied for in October 2009. Planning permission was granted for the new ground in Newmarket, subject to section 106 agreements, and since this news the club have yet again stalled in progress.

The 2009 season was Wakefield&#x27;s best-ever Super League season with the club finishing 5th on 32 points and qualifying for a home tie in the end of season play-offs.

=== 2010–2015: Financial difficulties ===

2010 was a disappointment to the club, after losing Shane Tronc, Terry Newton and Danny Brough, and despite bringing in Danny Kirmond, Charlie Leaeno and Julien Rinaldi, they still finished in 10th position, five places lower than the 2009 season.

In February 2011, the club entered administration to avoid a winding up petition from HMRC over £300,000 in unpaid taxes.

Former Hull coach Richard Agar became Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s head coach before the start of the 2012 Super League XVII season, on a three-year deal.

Agar was replaced by James Webster after a poor run of form in June 2014. Webster was sacked halfway into the 2015 season just before the Qualifiers started and was replaced by Brian Smith. They went on to win the inaugural Million Pound Game against Bradford Bulls to play another season in Super League. Smith resigned in March 2016.

=== 2016–present: Stability ===
Chris Chester was appointed head coach 16 March 2016 and revitalised the squad. Compared to the previous season when the team were fighting for survival, Chester guided them to a top 8 finish and a place in the Challenge Cup semi final.
2017 proved to be more successful than many pundits imagined – once again Trinity were in the top 8 of Superleague, despite being many peoples tip to finish last and face a relegation battle. In 2018, Wakefield finished 7th on the table at the end of the Super League XXIII season. The club went on to finish 5th at the end of the Super 8&#x27;s.
In the 2019 Super League season, the club finished ninth on the table.
In the 2020 Super League season, the club finished second bottom after a difficult campaign.

In the 2021 Super League season, Wakefield Trinity finished 10th in the competition. Towards the end of the season, the club terminated head coach Chris Chester. Wakefield later appointed Willie Poching as the new head coach.
Wakefield endured a difficult 2022 Super League season with the club struggling near the foot of the table. Following the clubs Magic Weekend loss to Toulouse Olympique, Wakefield found themselves in the relegation zone. However, the club would win five of their remaining seven matches to avoid relegation and finish in 10th place. On 12 September 2022, head coach Willie Poching announced he was departing Wakefield Trinity.
Wakefield Trinity started the 2023 Super League season poorly losing their opening nine matches in a row. Wakefield also became the first side of the Super League era to be held scoreless in five games throughout a season after losing 32–0 to Leigh in round 9.
After losing their opening 14 games of the 2023 Super League season, Wakefield Trinity recorded their first win of the campaign defeating Leeds 24-14.
In the second last round of the 2023 Super League season, Wakefield were officially relegated after losing 20-19 in golden point extra-time against Leigh. It ended Wakefield&#x27;s 24-year stay in the top flight.
After returning to the RFL Championship, Wakefield Trinity claimed the 1895 Cup and finished top of the Championship only losing one match for the entirety of the regular season.
They would then go on to reach the Championship grand final where the opponents would be Toulouse Olympique. Wakefield would win the match 36-0 to claim the title.
On 24 October 2024, Wakefield Trinity were promoted back to the Super League through the IMG grading system replacing the London Broncos.

==Crest and colours==
===Crest===

Every crest up until 1999 focused on the fleur-de-lys present on the Wakefield County Borough coat of arms. When the club was rebranded the Wildcats the fleur-de-lys was dropped although the club was still called Wakefield Trinity Wildcats. the new crest was the wildcat with Wildcats predominantly showing. In 2012 the crest was tweaked to contain the club&#x27;s full name and the fleur-de-lys symbol. The Wildcats name was still used, but from 2015 the fleur-de-lys featured inside a shield with two stars above it for the two Championship titles they have won. In 2017 the Club reverted to the name Wakefield Trinity and the club badge has been returned to a white fleur-de-Lys in a blue shield with the founding date of 1873 proudly displayed.

===Colours===

Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s colours are red, white and blue. Traditionally most of their kits are predominantly white with a red and blue V or a blue and red hoop although some kits have been predominantly blue or red.

==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==
==Rivalries==
Wakefield Trinity&#x27;s main rivals are Castleford who they play in the Calder Derby. The stadiums are only 8 miles apart. Each year Wakefield and Castleford compete for the Adam Watene trophy, named after a much-loved player who played for both teams but was taken tragically too soon. They also have another local rivalry with Featherstone Rovers although this is considered a lesser rival in recent years as they play in different leagues. Both Wakefield and Castleford have both been more successful than Featherstone Rovers in recent years.

There is a historic rivalry with Leeds as both were successful in the 60s and 70s and competed in some major games, the most famous being the 1968 challenge cup final where Leeds won in controversial fashion. Wakefield has other West Yorkshire rivalries with Huddersfield and Bradford.

==Stadium==
===Belle Vue===

The site was purchased in 1895 after the split between rugby league and rugby union, to provide a permanent base for Wakefield Trinity who had been playing on fields in the area since 1873. Money was provided by the Wakefield Athletic Club, and the ground was also used for cycling and athletics competitions.

Floodlights were installed in 1967 and were upgraded in 1990/91.

On Saturday 16 September 2006, the stadium played host to &#x27;The Battle of Belle Vue&#x27; when 11,000 fans from Trinity and Castleford watched the match which would decide who was relegated from Super League. Wakefield won the match 29–17 sending their nearest rivals Castleford down to the National League.

The capacity of the stadium was increased to 12,600 in 2008, to help with the application for a 2009 Super League licence, which was granted in July 2008.

In June 2015, it was announced Wakefield Trinity would leave Belle Vue at the end of the season as they could not afford to stay. Before the end of the season it was announced Belle Vue was up for sale and was sold in 2016. Although the new owners expressed interest in redeveloping the stadium, no progress has been announced publicly, and notice has once again been given and Trinity expect to leave Belle Vue at some stage. Negotiations and talks on the club&#x27;s future playing venue continue.

<text>Harry Richman (born Henry Reichman Jr.; August 10, 1895 – November 3, 1972) was an American singer, actor, dancer, comedian, pianist, songwriter, bandleader, and nightclub performer, at his most popular in the 1920s and 1930s. In his peak years, he was one of the highest‐paid performers in show business.

==Early life ==
Richman was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Russian Jewish parents Henry and Katie (&quot;née&quot; Golder) Reichman. His father died when he was 14 years old.

==Career==
Richman began playing piano in a Cincinnati saloon at age 10. At 18, he changed his name to &quot;Harry Richman&quot;, by which time he was already a professional entertainer in vaudeville. He claimed to be making $25,000 a week in 1931 ($415,000 in 2018 dollars) He also owned a popular night club – a Speakeasy, &quot;Club Richman&quot;, which was located next to Carnegie Hall. The room was large, seating 240 people. It was designed to look like a patio with fake windows that opened out to scenes painted in the windows. The roof was painted with stars to reflect the spotlight on the performers. It was a popular location till it burned down in 1929.

Eventually known for his nasal baritone, he started out and worked as a piano accompanist to such stars as Mae West and Nora Bayes. With Bayes&#x27; act, he made his Broadway debut in 1922. He appeared in several editions of the George White&#x27;s Scandals in the 1920s to acclaim. Becoming a name, he appeared in &quot;Scandals&quot; as master of ceremonies in 1926; where on opening night the first seven rows of the orchestra commanded $50 a seat ($700 in 2018 dollars). He appeared in the 1931 Ziegfeld Follies.

He made his feature movie debut in Hollywood in 1930 with the film &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;, featuring the Irving Berlin song of the same title, which gave Richman a phonograph record hit that year. His film career was short-lived due to his somewhat overpowering personality, and his limited acting skills. This made little difference to his career; he remained a popular nightclub host and stage performer.

Leonard Maltin is widely quoted as having written of &quot;Puttin&#x27; On the Ritz&quot;: &quot;A songwriter drinks and goes blind – after seeing this you&#x27;ll want to do the same&quot;. In fact, the actual quote is &quot;Famed nightclub entertainer Richman made his film debut in this primitive early talkie about vaudevillian who can&#x27;t handle success and turns to drink. You may do the same after watching Richman&#x27;s performance – though he does introduce the title song by Irving Berlin.&quot;

Richman had a residence near the end of his career at the Latin Quarter club in Boston, MA, where he performed on Sundays in late 1941.

Richman largely retired in the 1940s, although he made sporadic appearances, including on television, into the 1950s. In 1966, Richman released his memoirs, &quot;A Hell of a Life&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Richman was married three times and had no children. His first marriage was to Melvina Stephenson, whom he married in 1917. After divorcing Stephenson, Richard married showgirl Hazel Forbes in March 1938, in Palm Springs, California. He and Forbes shared a sumptuous home in Beechhurst, Long Island before divorcing in 1942. Richman married for the third and final time in 1943 to Yvonne Day. That marriage also ended in divorce.

===Political views===
Richman was a Democrat, he sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; at the 1940 Democratic National Convention, held at Chicago.

===Hobbies and adventures===
He enjoyed sailing; however, his yacht &quot;Chevalier II&quot; exploded in July 1931, killing one.

Richman was also an amateur aviator of some accomplishment, being the co-pilot in 1936, with famed flyer Henry Tindall &quot;Dick&quot; Merrill, of the first round-trip transatlantic flight in his own single-engine Vultee V-1AD transport, named &quot;The Lady Peace.&quot; Richman had filled much of the empty space of the aircraft with ping pong balls as a flotation aid in case they were forced down in the Atlantic. They were forced to land in Wales in 18 hours and 38 minutes. The publicity enabled him to sell autographed ping pong balls until his death, and specimens of these continue to show up for sale on celebrity memorabilia websites. The only surviving Vultee V-1, of which only 25 were built, similar to Richman&#x27;s, is in the Shannon Air Museum in Fredericksburg, Va.

==Later years and death==
Richman spent most of his fortune lavishly, and his final years were mostly impoverished. He suffered from a long string of illnesses over several years before his death. On November 3, 1972, Richman died in Hollywood, California, at the age of 77. He is buried at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California.

<text>Amjad Khan (12 November 1940 – 27 July 1992) was an Indian renowned actor and film director. He worked in over 132 films in a career spanning nearly twenty years. He was the son of the actor Jayant. He gained popularity for villainous roles in mostly Hindi films, the most famous among his enacted roles being Gabbar Singh in the 1975 cult classic film &quot;Sholay&quot; and of Dilawar in &quot;Muqaddar Ka Sikandar&quot; (1978).

==Early life==
Amjad Khan was born in Bombay, Bombay State, British India on 12 November 1940 into a family of Khalil Pashtuns descent to actor Jayant; who was originally from Peshawar, North-West Frontier Province.

His younger brother Imtiaz Khan was also an actor. Amjad Khan was educated at St. Andrew&#x27;s High School in Bandra.

He attended Rishi Dayaram and Seth Hassaram National College and Seth Wassiamull Assomull Science College where he held the position of general secretary. During his college and school days, he worked as a theater artist and performed in his college with his brother.

==Career==

Before Amjad Khan came to films, he was a theatre actor. His first role was as a child actor at the age of 11 in the film &quot;Nazneen&quot; in 1951. His next role was at the age of 17 in the film &quot;Ab Dilli Dur Nahin&quot; (1957). He assisted K. Asif in the film &quot;Love And God&quot; in the late 1960s and had a brief appearance in the film. The film was left incomplete after Asif&#x27;s death in 1971, and it was finally released in 1986. In 1973, he appeared in &quot;Hindustan Ki Kasam&quot; in a small role.

In 1975, he was offered the role of dacoit &quot;Gabbar Singh&quot; for the film &quot;Sholay&quot; by Salim Khan, who was one of its writers. In preparation for the role, Amjad read &quot;Abhishapth Chambal&quot;, a book on Chambal dacoits written by &quot;Taroon Kumar Bhaduri&quot; (actress Jaya Bhaduri&#x27;s father). Amjad shot to stardom with the movie. His mannerisms and dialogues have become an integral part of the Bollywood lexicon and spawned numerous parodies and spoofs [Specially &quot;Soja Nahi to Gabbar Aajayega&quot;]. &quot;Sholay&quot; went on to become a blockbuster. Although it boasted an ensemble cast of superstars including Dharmendra, Amitabh Bachchan and Sanjeev Kumar, who was nominated that year for the Filmfare award for Best Actor category, Amjad stole the show with his unorthodox and eerie dialogue delivery. Even to this day people fondly remember his dialogues and mannerisms. He later appeared in advertisements as Gabbar Singh endorsing Britannia Glucose Biscuits (popularly known as &quot;Gabbar Ki Asli Pasand&quot;), the first incidence of a villain being used to sell a popular product.

After the success of &quot;Sholay&quot;, Khan continued to play negative roles in many subsequent Hindi films in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s – superseding, in terms of popularity and demand, the earlier Indian actor, Ajit. He often acted as villain opposite Amitabh Bachchan as the hero. His role in &quot;Inkaar&quot; was also presented in terrifying manner. He made his presence felt in &quot;Des Pardes&quot;, &quot;Nastik&quot;, &quot;Satte Pe Satta&quot;, &quot;Chambal Ki Kasam&quot;, &quot;Ganga Ki Saugandh&quot;, &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Nahin&quot; and &quot;Naseeb&quot;.

Khan was also acclaimed for playing many unconventional roles. In the critically acclaimed film &quot;Shatranj Ke Khiladi&quot; (1977) (based on the novel of the same title), by Munshi Premchand and directed by Satyajit Ray, Khan played the helpless and deluded monarch Wajid Ali Shah, whose kingdom, Avadh, is being targeted by British colonialists from the British East India Company. It is the only movie in which he dubbed a song. In 1979, he portrayed Emperor Akbar in the film &quot;Meera&quot;. He played many positive roles such as in &quot;Yaarana&quot; (1981) and &quot;Laawaris&quot; (1981) as Amitabh&#x27;s friend and father respectively, &quot;Rocky&quot; (1981) and &quot;Commander&quot; (1981). In the art film &quot;Utsav&quot; (1984), he portrayed Vatsayana, the author of the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot;. In 1988, he appeared in the Merchant Ivory English language film &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot; as an underworld don. He excelled at playing comical characters in films such as &quot;Qurbani&quot; (1980), &quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;Chameli Ki Shaadi&quot; (1986). In 1991, he reprised his role as Gabbar Singh in &quot;Ramgarh Ke Sholay&quot;, a parody of the legendary film which included look-alikes of Dev Anand and Amitabh Bachchan.

He ventured into directing for a brief period in the 1980s, directing and starring in &quot;Chor Police&quot; (1983) and &quot;Ameer Aadmi Gareeb Aadmi&quot; (1985), both of the films did not do well at the box office.

Amjad was the president of the Actors Guild Association. He was respected in the film industry, and would intervene and negotiate disputes between actors and directors/producers. One such dispute occurred when Meenakshi Seshadri was forced to drop out of &quot;Damini&quot; (1993) by Raj Kumar Santoshi because she rejected his proposal. Amjad Khan sorted out the matter and made Raj Santoshi take back his harsh decision.

==Personal life and death==
In 1972, he married Shaila Khan daughter of Akhtar ul Iman screenwriter and in the following year, she gave birth to their first child, Shadaab Khan. He also had a daughter, Ahlam Khan, and another son, Seemaab Khan. Ahlam married popular theatre actor Zafar Karachiwala in 2011.

On 15 October 1976, Amjad Khan met with a serious accident on the Mumbai-Goa highway which left him with broken ribs and a punctured lung. He was going to participate in the shooting of the film &quot;The Great Gambler&quot;, starring Amitabh Bachchan.

On 27 July 1992, he died of a heart attack. He was 51.

<text>Earthworks are engineering works created through the processing of parts of the earth&#x27;s surface involving quantities of soil or unformed rock.

==Shoring structures==
An incomplete list of possible temporary or permanent geotechnical shoring structures that may be designed and utilised as part of earthworks:

*Mechanically stabilized earth
*Earth anchor
*Cliff stabilization
*Grout curtain
*Retaining wall
*Slurry wall
*Soil nailing
*Tieback (geotechnical)
*Trench shoring
*Caisson
*Dam
*Gabion
*Ground freezing
===Gallery===
==Excavation==

Excavation may be classified by type of material:
* Topsoil excavation
* Earth excavation
* Rock excavation
* Muck excavation – this usually contains excess water and unsuitable soil
* Unclassified excavation – this is any combination of material types
Excavation may be classified by the purpose:
* Roadway excavation
* Drainage or structure excavation
* Bridge excavation
* Channel excavation
* Footing excavation
* Borrow excavation
* Dredge excavation
* Underground excavation
==Civil engineering use==
Typical earthworks include road construction, railway beds, causeways, dams, levees, canals, and berms. Other common earthworks are land grading to reconfigure the topography of a site, or to stabilize slopes.

==Military use==

In military engineering, earthworks are, more specifically, types of fortifications constructed from soil. Although soil is not very strong, it is cheap enough that huge quantities can be used, generating formidable structures. Examples of older earthwork fortifications include moats, sod walls, motte-and-bailey castles, and hill forts. Modern examples include trenches and berms.

==Equipment==
Heavy construction equipment is usually used due to the amounts of material to be moved — up to millions of cubic metres. Earthwork construction was revolutionized by the development of the (Fresno) scraper and other earth-moving machines such as the loader, the dump truck, the grader, the bulldozer, the backhoe, and the dragline excavator.

==Mass haul planning==

Engineers need to concern themselves with issues of geotechnical engineering (such as soil density and strength) and with quantity estimation to ensure that soil volumes in the cuts match those of the fills, while minimizing the distance of movement. In the past, these calculations were done by hand using a slide rule and with methods such as Simpson&#x27;s rule. Earthworks cost is a function of hauled amount x hauled distance. The goal of mass haul planning is to determine these amounts and the goal of mass haul optimization is to minimize either or both.

Now they can be performed with a computer and specialized software, including optimisation on haul cost and not haul distance (as haul cost is not proportional to haul distance).

==Calculation software==

Earthwork software is generally a subset of CAD software, in which case it often an add-on to a more general CAD package such as AutoCAD. In that case, earthwork software is principally used to calculate cut and fill volumes which are then used for producing material and time estimates. Most products offer additional functionality such as the ability to takeoff terrain elevation from plans (using contour lines and spot heights); produce shaded cut and fill maps; produce cross sections and visualize terrain in 3D. The means by which volumes are calculated in software can differ quite considerably leading to potentially different results with the same input data. Many software products use methods based on triangulated irregular networks (TINS) and triangular prism volume algorithms, however other calculation methods are in use based on rationalizing elevations into high density grids or cross-sections.

A few programs are specialised in earthworks transport optimization and planning the construction works.

<doc id="1096029" wikidata="Q1240471" url="?curid=1096029" title="William de Ros, 6th Baron Ros">
<text>William de Ros, 6th Baron Ros ( – 1 November 1414), was a medieval English nobleman, politician and soldier. The second son of Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron Ros, and Beatrice Stafford, William inherited his father&#x27;s feudal barony and estates (with extensive lands centred on Lincolnshire) in 1394. Shortly afterwards, he married Margaret, daughter of John FitzAlan, 1st Baron Arundel. The Fitzalan family, like that of de Ros, was well-connected at the local and national level. They were implacably opposed to King Richard II, and this may have soured Richard&#x27;s opinion of the young de Ros.

The late 14th century was a period of political crisis in England. In 1399, Richard II confiscated the estates of his cousin, Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, and exiled him. Bolingbroke invaded England several months later, and de Ros took his side almost immediately. Richard&#x27;s support had deserted him; de Ros was alongside Henry when Richard surrendered his throne to the invader, who became King Henry IV. De Ros later voted in the House of Lords for the former king&#x27;s imprisonment. De Ros benefited from the new Lancastrian regime, achieving far more than he had ever done under Richard. He became an important aide and counsellor to King Henry and regularly spoke for him in Parliament. He also supported Henry in his military campaigns, participating in the invasion of Scotland in 1400 and assisting in the suppression of the rebellion of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York, five years later.

In return for his loyalty to the new regime, de Ros received extensive royal patronage. This included lands, grants, wardships, and the right to arrange the wards&#x27; marriages. De Ros performed valuable service as an advisor and ambassador (perhaps most importantly to Henry, who was often in a state of near-penury; de Ros was a wealthy man, and regularly loaned the crown large amounts of money). Important as he was in government and the regions, de Ros was unable to avoid the tumultuous regional conflicts and feuds which were rife at this time. In 1411 he was involved in a land dispute with a powerful Lincolnshire neighbour, and narrowly escaped an ambush; he sought and received redress in Parliament. Partly because of de Ros&#x27;s restraint in not seeking the severe penalties available to him, he was described by a 20th-century historian as a particularly wise and forbearing figure for his time.

King Henry IV died in 1413. De Ros did not long survive him, and played only a minor role in government during the last year of his life. He may have been out of favour with the new king, Henry V. As Prince of Wales, Henry had fallen out with his father a few years before, and de Ros had supported Henry IV over his son. De Ros died in Belvoir Castle on 1 November 1414. His wife survived him by twenty-four years; his son and heir, John, was still a minor. John later fought at Agincourt in 1415 and died childless in France in 1421. The barony of de Ros was then inherited by William&#x27;s second son, Thomas, who also died in military service in France, seven years after his brother.

== Background and career under Richard II ==
The exact date of William de Ros&#x27;s birth is unknown. He was described in 1394 as about twenty-three years old, which would place his birth year around 1370. His family was an important one in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, and the historian Chris Given-Wilson has described them as one of the greatest fourteenth-century baronial families to never receive an earldom. De Ros&#x27;s father was Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron Ros, who fought in the Hundred Years&#x27; War under Edward III (particularly in the Poitiers campaign of 1356). Several years before William&#x27;s birth, King Edward instructed Thomas to remain with his army on his Irish estates &quot;to prevent the loss and destruction of the country&quot;. Thomas married Beatrice, the widow of Maurice Fitzgerald, Earl of Desmond, and daughter of the first Earl of Stafford. He died in Uffington, Lincolnshire, in June 1384, and his eldest son John—William&#x27;s elder brother—inherited the title as fifth Baron Ros.

De Ros also had two younger brothers, Robert and Thomas, &quot;of whom nothing is known&quot;. John&#x27;s career was brief. By 1382 he had married Mary, half-sister of the Earl of Northumberland. John fought for the new king, Richard II (heir of Edward III, who died in 1377), in the 1385–86 Scottish campaign and with the Earl of Arundel in France the following year. During the early 1390s, John made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; he died in Paphos on 6 August 1393, on his return journey to England. John and Mary had not produced an heir, and (although he was never expected to succeed to the barony) de Ros was next in line. He inherited as sixth Baron Ros, by which time he had been knighted and appointed to the Privy Council.

=== Inheritance and marriage ===

The de Ros estates were primarily in the east and north of England. William received livery of them in January 1384, which gave him an extensive sphere of influence around Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, and eastern Yorkshire. By this time, the estate had two dowager baronesses to support: his deceased brother&#x27;s wife Mary and their mother, Beatrice. Mary died within a year of her husband, and her extensive inheritance was divided among her Percy relations. De Ros received her dower lands, which included the ancient Barony of Helmsley. Beatrice, on the other hand, had outlived three husbands and would outlive William; she was assigned her dower lands in December 1384. This meant that de Ros would never hold a large swath of land, predominantly in the East Riding of Yorkshire.

De Ros received &quot;seisin&quot; of his estates on 11 February 1394, which included custody of several Clifford family estates; his sister had married Thomas de Clifford, 6th Baron de Clifford around 1379. He held the latter lands until their son came of age around 1411. De Ros married Margaret, daughter of John Fitzalan, 1st Baron Arundel and Eleanor Maltravers, soon after he inherited. She was already in receipt of a 40-mark annuity from King Richard II because she had been in the household of Richard&#x27;s recently deceased queen, Anne of Bohemia. His wife gave de Ros what may have appeared to be a useful connection to the crown. Also useful to William was the fact that his wife&#x27;s father had recently died, so de Ros now had the Earl of Arundel as a brother-in-law. His new connections and the higher political profile they brought may account for the royal grants he soon received of Clifford manors in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Worcestershire. These had been the dower lands of Euphemia (widow of Robert, Lord Clifford), who had died in November 1393. De Ros attended the king&#x27;s wedding to his second wife—Isabella of Valois, daughter of King Charles VI of France—in Calais in December 1396. His wife&#x27;s grandfather died the following year, and she became Lady Maltravers &quot;suo jure&quot;.

Although de Ros received some royal favour, Charles Ross has suggested that he may not have been doing as well as expected for a man in his position. Ross suggests that William&#x27;s Fitzalan connections might have worked against him with the king. Arundel was a staunch political opponent of Richard&#x27;s, and de Ros&#x27;s marrying into this politically unpopular family may account for the few offices the king granted him. &quot;It seems strange&quot;, says Ross, &quot;that a wealthy young lord, who later proved himself both active and able in the royal service, had no public, and very little local employment during the later years of Richard II&quot;. De Ros&#x27;s situation would not change until the accession of Arundel&#x27;s political ally, Henry Bolingbroke, as King Henry IV in 1399. He was rarely appointed to peace commissions and did not sit on many &quot;oyer and Terminer&quot; assizes, even in his own counties.

== Regime change and career under Henry IV ==

John of Gaunt—the most powerful noble in the country and second only to the crown in wealth—died in February 1399. Bolingbroke and King Richard had fallen out the previous year, and Richard had exiled Bolingbroke for six years the previous September. Instead of allowing Bolingbroke to succeed to his father&#x27;s estates and titles, says Given-Wilson, Richard &quot;succumb[ed] to the temptation&quot; to confiscate the Duchy of Lancaster. Richard proclaimed that Bolingbroke&#x27;s exile was now a life sentence, and cancelled his writs of seisin. He further decreed that Bolingbroke could only request his inheritance at the king&#x27;s pleasure. Bolingbroke, in Paris, joined forces with the also-exiled Thomas Arundel. Arundel had been Archbishop of Canterbury, and was de Ros&#x27;s wife&#x27;s uncle; he lost his office because of his involvement with the Lords Appellant, and been exiled since 1397. With Arundel and a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire in late June 1399. De Ros, bringing a large retinue, joined Bolingbroke&#x27;s army almost immediately (as did much of the northern nobility). Richard was campaigning in Ireland at the time, and unable to defend his throne. Henry initially announced that he intended only to reclaim his rights as Duke of Lancaster, although he quickly gained enough power and support (including that of de Ros) to claim the throne in Richard&#x27;s stead and have himself proclaimed King Henry IV. In June, de Ros was present at Berkeley Castle when Henry and Richard met for the first time since Henry was exiled; de Ros witnessed their final meeting on 6 September at the Tower of London, when Richard resigned the throne. Bolingbroke&#x27;s accession as Henry IV saw an uplift in de Ros&#x27;s fortunes and those of the Fitzalans. De Ros now had strong connections with important figures at court and a relatively close friendship with the new king. In contrast to his treatment by Richard, de Ros&#x27;s previous loyal service to Henry—and the king&#x27;s father—earned him significant royal patronage. In the first parliament of the new reign—held at Westminster in October 1399—he was appointed a Trier of Petitions, and was one of the lords who voted to imprison Richard (who later died in Pontefract Castle of unknown causes). De Ros&#x27;s new position at the centre of government was highlighted in December 1399, when he was appointed to Henry&#x27;s first royal council.

De Ros&#x27;s motives for joining Bolingbroke&#x27;s invasion so swiftly are unknown but, says Given-Wilson, this should be no surprise; for most of Henry&#x27;s new-found allies, &quot;it is only possible to speculate as to their political allegiance&quot;. De Ros may have felt generally aggrieved by Richard&#x27;s poor treatment of Gaunt and Bolingbroke, and his own lack of promotion under Richard was doubtless important. Whatever his reasons were for rebelling in 1399, de Ros and his father had been Lancastrian (rather than Ricardian) in their loyalties. His father had been one of John of Gaunt&#x27;s earliest retainers when the young Gaunt was Earl of Richmond, and de Ros had also been retained by Gaunt in the late fourteenth century. Service to the duke had involved de Ros accompanying the duke abroad and travelling on his business on at least five occasions in the last years of Gaunt&#x27;s life. For his services de Ros received annuities of £40 to £50, and was one of only two knights banneret whom Gaunt retained.
=== Local administration and political crisis ===
de Ros was an active royal official in the local administration and became a leading member of political society in the north Midlands and Yorkshire, where he regularly headed royal commissions. He was frequently appointed a justice of the peace, particularly in Leicestershire. De Ros&#x27;s service to the crown was not confined to the regions; in 1401, he directed the king&#x27;s attempts to increase the royal income. He was appointed Henry&#x27;s negotiator with the House of Commons, to persuade the Commons to agree to a subsidy for the king&#x27;s intended invasion of Scotland later that summer. De Ros and the Commons representatives met in Westminster&#x27;s refectory. Emphasising &quot;favourable consideration&quot; the Commons would receive from the king, he played heavily on the king&#x27;s expenses in defending the Welsh and Scottish Marches. Each party was wary of the other; the king did not wish to set a precedent, and the Commons were traditionally wary of the House of Lords. Six years later, de Ros played much the same role—with the Duke of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury, on a committee hearing the Commons&#x27; complaints. The result of these discussions was an altercation in which the Commons, reports the parliament roll, were &quot;hugely disturbed&quot;. This disturbance, according to J. H. Wylie, was probably the result of something de Ros said and would account for the Commons&#x27; reluctance to meet him or his committee. De Ros&#x27;s remit was to persuade the Commons to grant as substantial a tax—in exchange for as few liberties granted—as possible. An experienced parliamentarian, he attended most parliaments from 1394 to 1413.

Almost from the beginning of his reign, Henry faced problems. Most stemmed from financial insecurity since by 1402 his treasury was empty. Around this time, de Ros was appointed Lord Treasurer. Charles Ross suggests that this demonstrated the king&#x27;s increased confidence in de Ros, who occupied the post for the next four years. He was unable to substantially improve Henry&#x27;s financial situation, and relations with the Commons worsened. During the 1404 parliament, speaker Arnold Savage confronted the king over his lack of money (and repeated demands for taxation), which Savage said could be ameliorated by reducing the number of annuities paid by the crown. Savage also condemned an unnamed crown minister for owing royal creditors over £6,000. The House of Commons&#x27; dissatisfaction was obvious to the king, who responded within the week. He despatched de Ros, accompanied by Chancellor Henry Beaufort, to the Commons with a comprehensive breakdown of the king&#x27;s financial requirements. According to Ian Mortimer, &quot;Savage, having attacked royal policy in the King&#x27;s presence, had no compunction about speaking his mind to the chancellor and treasurer&quot;. Henry&#x27;s government continued to subsist on poor revenues. As Given-Wilson put it, the treasury became &quot;largely reliant on a diminishing circle of the faithful&quot; (which included de Ros). He made numerous loans to the king, and temporarily surrendered his councillor&#x27;s salary for the sake of the royal finances.

De Ros also performed extensive military service. In 1400, he contracted with the king to bring a fully crewed ship of 20 men at arms and 40 archers to Henry&#x27;s Scottish invasion. Although the campaign declined in success, de Ros played a part in it. Returning to Westminster, he resumed his office of councillor and participated in Henry&#x27;s Great Council the following year. In 1402 Owain Glyndŵr rebelled, which impacted de Ros personally. His brother-in-law, Reginald, Lord Grey of Ruthin—who had married de Ros&#x27;s youngest sister, Margaret—was captured and imprisoned by Glyndŵr; personal animosity between Grey and Glyndŵr may have been to blame for the outbreak of the rebellion. The Welsh demanded a 10,000-mark ransom from the king, who agreed to pay. De Ros, because of his relationship to Grey, also agreed to contribute and led the commission which negotiated with Glyndŵr over its payment and his brother-in-law&#x27;s release. A friend of de Ros, fellow Midlands baron Robert, Lord Willoughby, accompanied him in the negotiations.
De Ros was also elected to the Order of the Garter in 1402, and was granted an annuity of 100 marks a year as the king&#x27;s retainer two years later. In May of that year another rebellion broke out in the north, led by Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York and the disaffected Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland. One of their first acts was to kidnap the king&#x27;s envoy. De Ros was part of an extensive network of north Lancastrian loyalists who gathered around the king&#x27;s cousin Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland to suppress the rebellion. Henry entrusted de Ros to meet with Westmorland, commander of the king&#x27;s armies in the north. de Ros was probably chosen because of the king&#x27;s intimate advisors, his local knowledge would have been the most valuable. The mission was a success; de Ros witnessed the Earl of Northumberland surrendering Berwick Castle to the king, and sat on the commission which condemned Scrope to death without trial in early June 1405. When the king arrived in York to oversee the execution of the rebels, de Ros brought Percy&#x27;s bonds to him.

Since de Ros had been instructed only to engage the rebels on the king&#x27;s express instruction, it is difficult to ascertain the role that he and Gascoigne played in the rebellion&#x27;s suppression. Unlike the Earl of Westmorland, &quot;no more is heard of their activities&quot; in the north until after the confrontation at Shipton Moor. De Ros&#x27;s role may have been to oversee the later judicial commissions over the rebels, and he was authorised to pardon those who rejected rebellion and wished to return to the king&#x27;s grace. The fact that so little of their work remains visible to historians may suggest surreptitiousness; possibly, says Given-Wilson, they were little more than spies tailing their prey until the king&#x27;s main army caught up.

The following year, the king&#x27;s health (which had not been strong for some time) broke down for good. At the parliament of 1406, Henry IV agreed that since it was clear that poor health prevented him from ruling, a Grand Council should be established to assist him in governing. Although de Ros was on the original list presented to parliament of those to be appointed to the council, how long he served is subject to conjecture. He was attending its meetings in late 1406 (since he was an unofficial &quot;chaperone&quot; for his successor as Lord Treasurer, Lord Furnivall), and may have still been on the council the following June. De Ros regularly witnessed royal charters, and continued his role as the king&#x27;s spokesman to the Commons. He probably assisted the Lord Chancellor through an increasingly difficult and uncertain period (due to the King&#x27;s ill health), but it is uncertain whether he chose—or was instructed—to do so.

=== Royal favour ===

For the duration of Henry&#x27;s reign, de Ros was &quot;high in the King&#x27;s confidence and enjoyed especially trusted positions&quot;. The historian Mark Arvanigian summarises de Ros&#x27;s position as &quot;clearly a reliable and trusted servant, as well as being a reasonably talented administrator and royal councillor&quot;. Henry continued relying on loans to carry out policy, and de Ros&#x27;s loan funded the Calais garrison. Unlike many—and indicating the favour with which the King held him in—de Ros was promised repayment, manifested in the royal patronage he continued to receive. By 1409, for example, he had been appointed to the lucrative positions of master forester and constable of Pickering Castle. These offices strengthened his influence in the region, allowed him to appoint deputies, and gave him another patronage of his own to dispense. In October of that year, de Ros paid £80 for the custody of Giffard family lands in the South Midlands. John Tuchet, Lord Audley died in December, and de Ros was granted Audley&#x27;s lands while the Audley heir was a minor. De Ros also paid £2,000 for the right to arrange the heir&#x27;s marriage. The Audley estates from which de Ros intended to get his money back were greatly overvalued, and he was charged only half the original amount. These grants were in addition to his annual conciliar salary of £100, and he held the manor of Chingford to quarter himself and his men when he was regularly in the south on royal business. De Ros remained an active councillor and undertook significant military and diplomatic roles. He was one of Henry&#x27;s few advisors who, even when the king&#x27;s council was not sitting, remained a close counsellor.

De Ros remained in the King&#x27;s favour through the final years of Henry&#x27;s reign. As a trusted counsellor, in 1410 he participated in what has been described as &quot;a show trial of national importance&quot;. The previous year, an ecclesiastical court had found John Badby of Evesham guilty of Lollardy. According to church custom, Badby had been given a year&#x27;s grace to recant. He refused; if anything, his opinions were more entrenched than before. On 1 March 1410, Badby was brought before a convocation at the Friars-Preachers House. De Ros and his fellow barons found Badby guilty and passed secular judgement. He was burnt to death (possibly, according to sixteenth-century martyrologist John Foxe, in a barrel) in Smithfield.

=== Regional disorder ===
After the death of the Earl of Stafford in 1403 (whose infant heir had a twenty-year minority), de Ros was the leading baron in Staffordshire. He was responsible for upholding the king&#x27;s peace during a period that has been a by-word for the kind of pervasive lawlessness that de Ros, like all regional magnates, was expected to suppress. Particularly well-known is the frequency with which the baronage and gentry indulged in internecine fighting. In 1411, his intervention averted a tense situation which was likely to erupt into armed conflict between local gentry Alexander Mering and John Tuxford. This was only a temporary ceasefire, however; the following year, de Ros sponsored a second arbitration between the parties with which they promised to abide on pain of a 500-mark fine. In early 1411 Sir Walter Tailboys caused a riot in Lincoln, attacked the sheriffs, killed two men, and lay in wait outside the city in ambush (preventing its residents from leaving). Lincoln&#x27;s citizens petitioned the king for justice and explicitly requested that de Ros and his kinsman, Lord Beaumont, be appointed to investigate. They found in favour of the Lincoln citizenry and, reflecting the severity of Tailboy&#x27;s offence, he was bound over to keep the peace for £3,000. Due to such efforts, Simon Payling has suggested that de Ros&#x27;s &quot;reputation for fair-mindedness&quot; made him a popular figure for settling gentry disputes.
Despite his aptitude for dispute resolution, de Ros was not exempt from local conflict. He became involved in a dispute with his Lincolnshire neighbour, Sir Robert Tirwhit, in 1411. Tirwhit was a newly appointed royal justice and a well-known figure in the county. He and de Ros fell out over conflicting claims to common grazing and associated hay-mowing and turf-digging rights in Wrawby. An arbitration took place before Justice William Gascoigne, who ordered a Loveday arranged. The Loveday was intended to offer both parties the opportunity to demonstrate their support for the arbitration process; the two men were expected to attend with companions (or followers), keeping their numbers to a minimum. Tirwhit, however, brought a small army of about 500 men. Later justifying the size, he claimed not to have agreed to the Loveday in the first place. De Ros kept to the arrangement &quot;vis á vis&quot; his retinue, bringing with him only Lords Beaumont and de la Warre (the latter, like Beaumont, a relative).

He and his companions escaped Tirwhit&#x27;s ambush unharmed. Given-Wilson has argued that, although the case was not uncommon in its basic facts, &quot;the personal involvement of a royal justice in such a calculated act of violence, and the status of the protagonists, clearly gave it an interest above the usual&quot;. On 4 November 1411, de Ros petitioned parliament—at which he was appointed a Trier of Petitions—for satisfaction. The case was heard before the Lord Chamberlain and the Archbishop of Canterbury, and took over three weeks to determine. The Chamberlain and Archbishop requested the attendance of de Ros and all the &quot;knyghtes and Esquiers and Yomen that had ledynge of men&quot; for him. After deliberating, they found firmly in de Ros&#x27;s favour. Tirwhit was bound to give de Ros a quantity of Gascon wine and provide the food and drink for the next Loveday, where he would publicly apologise to de Ros. In his apology, Tirwhit acknowledged that a nobleman of de Ros&#x27;s position could also have brought an army and he had shown forbearance in not doing so. The only responsibility de Ros was given as part of the arbitration award was that at the second Loveday, he would provide the entertainment.

== Later years and death ==

Although the King&#x27;s health continued to decline, he improved sufficiently in 1411 to direct the formation of a new council of his loyal councillors; this intentionally excluded his son, Prince Henry and the prince&#x27;s associates, Henry and Thomas Beaufort, from power. De Ros—the &quot;reliable royalist&quot;—sat on the council for the next fifteen months with other &quot;unswervingly loyal&quot; officials, such as the Bishops of Durham and Bath and Wells and the Archbishop of York. De Ros and the others now signed administrative documents which had required the king&#x27;s signet seal. A. L. Brown and Henry Summerson, two of the king&#x27;s recent biographers, note that &quot;at the end of his reign, as at its beginning, Henry placed his trust principally in his Lancastrian retainers&quot;.

Henry IV died on 20 March 1413. De Ros played no significant role in government from then on, after probably attending his last council meeting in 1412. Charles Ross posits that he was &quot;no particular favourite&quot; of the new king, Henry V, which Ross attributes to Henry V&#x27;s distrust of his father&#x27;s loyalists (who, in his eyes, kept him from what he felt was his rightful position at the head of government during his father&#x27;s illness). Whether or not Henry excluded him from the government, de Ros lived only eighteen months into the new reign. His mother had drawn up her will in January 1414, of which de Ros was an executor. Early that year, de Ros sat on a final anti-Lollard commission and was tasked with investigating the murder of an MP in the Midlands.

De Ros died in Belvoir Castle on 1 November 1414. He had drawn up his will two years earlier, and added a codicil in February 1414. He died a wealthy man, with one of Yorkshire&#x27;s highest disposable incomes.

Three of de Ros&#x27;s children fought in the last period of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. John, his heir, was born in 1397 and was legally a minor when de Ros died. The Earl of Dorset, the king&#x27;s cousin, received custody of the de Ros estates. Before he inherited, John travelled to France with the new king in 1415 and fought at the Battle of Agincourt at the age of seventeen or eighteen. He died in 1421 at the Battle of Baugé with the king&#x27;s brother, Thomas, Duke of Clarence and Sir Gilbert V de Umfraville. William de Ros&#x27;s second son Thomas was only fourteen at John&#x27;s death, and fought with Thomas, Earl of Salisbury, at the siege of Orléans in 1428; he died after a skirmish outside Paris two years later. Thomas&#x27;s heir (also named Thomas) inherited the lordship as ninth baron and played an important role in the Wars of the Roses fighting for the Lancastrian king, Henry VI; he was beheaded after his defeat by the Yorkists at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor in 1464. De Ros&#x27;s wife, Margaret Fitzalan, lived until 1438. She had received her dower by February 1415 and, at the marriage of Henry V to Catherine of Valois in 1420, entered the new queen&#x27;s service as a lady-in-waiting. Margaret attended Catherine&#x27;s coronation and travelled with her to see Henry in France two years later.

=== Family and bequests ===

With his wife, Margaret Fitzalan, William de Ros had four sons: John, Thomas, Robert and Richard. They also had four daughters: Beatrice, Alice, Margaret and Elizabeth. De Ros also had an illegitimate son, John, by a now-unknown woman. Charles de Ross suggests that he &quot;provides full confirmation of what the scanty evidence as to the character of his earlier career suggests, that de Ros was a man of just and equitable temperament&quot; by the nature and extent of his bequests. His heir, John, inherited his father&#x27;s lordship and patrimony and his armour and a gold sword. His third son, Robert—whom Ross describes as &quot;evidently his favourite&quot;—also inherited a quantity of land. De Ros made this provision for Robert from John&#x27;s patrimony, a decision described by G. L. Harriss as &quot;overrid[ing] both family duty and convention&quot;. His younger three sons (Thomas, Robert, and Richard) received a third of de Ros&#x27;s goods among them; Thomas, traditional for a younger son, was intended for an ecclesiastical career. Margaret received another third of his goods. His illegitimate son, John, received £40 towards his upkeep. Loyal retainers received benefices, and de Ros&#x27;s &quot;humbler dependents&quot;—for instance, the poor on his Lincolnshire estates—received often-massive sums among them. His executors—one of whom was his heir, John—received £20 each for their services. De Ros was buried in Belvoir Priory, and an alabaster effigy was erected in St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Bottesford, on the right side of the altar. Seven years later, after his death at Baugé, an effigy of his son John was placed on the left. De Ros left £400 to pay ten chaplains for eight years to educate his sons.

== In Shakespeare ==
William de Ros appears in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Richard II&quot; as Lord Ross. His character performs a double act of sorts with Lord Willoughby in their (ultimately successful) attempts to persuade the Earl of Northumberland to revolt against Richard, although as one reviewer has noted, indicating &quot;little sense of rebels carefully testing the political water&quot; before doing so. Together, the three of them are the core of the conspiracy to overthrow Richard. In their colloquies—for which R. F. Hill has compared them to a Senecan Chorus— they provide the audience with a catalogue of Richard&#x27;s misdeeds by re-telling his history of poor governance. Lord Ross, says Hill, is &quot;lured&quot; by the earl into conversation, which results in their plotting. Lord Ross tells Northumberland, &quot;The commons hath [King Richard] pill&#x27;d with grievous taxes / And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined / For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts&quot; and is portrayed as an overt follower of Henry Bolingbroke from the beginning. Shakespeare has this discussion take place in the north; in this way, says Hill, their separation from the King emphasises their geographical closeness to Bolingbroke.

The speed with which Lord Ross deserts Richard and joins Henry is in stark contrast to the themes of loyalty and honour that the play deals with, suggests Margaret Shewring. Described by Shakespeare (based on Raphael Holinshed&#x27;s chronicle) as &quot;fiery-red with haste&quot;, Lord Ross joins Bolingbroke at Berkeley, Gloucestershire. In 1738—when the public image of the King, George I, was poor—the play was put on by John Rich, in the knowledge that it was &quot;dangerously topical in terms of contemporary politics&quot;. The discussion between Lords Ross, Willoughby and Northumberland on the faults of the King—&quot;basely led/by flatterers&quot;—has been argued to have reflected contemporary disfavour with George, who was widely believed to be under the influence of his chief minister, Horace Walpole. A contemporary, Thomas Davies, watched the performance and later wrote how &quot;almost every line that was spoken to the occurrences of the time, and to the measures and character of the ministry&quot;.

The text of &quot;Richard II&quot; is often cut by directors, either to tighten the plot or to avoid problems with weak casting, and the role of Lord Ross is occasionally omitted. For example, in the 1981 Bard Productions film, his lines were given to the Exton character, and in the Erickson-Farrell 2001 film, Lord Ross was one of seven characters dropped, his role again given to Exton. He has still been played by several actors in post-war performances. At the 1947 Avignon Festival, Pierre Lautrec played to Jean Vilar&#x27;s Richard; Vilar also directed the play. The same year, Walter Hudd directed it with the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre (SMT) at Stratford-upon-Avon, with Joss Ackland as Lord Ross to Robert Harris&#x27;s Richard. Four years later, Anthony Quayle—also with the SMT—directed Michael Redgrave as the King, Harry Andrews as Bolingbroke, and Philip Morant in the part of Lord Ross. In 1968 the Prospect Theatre toured Richard II in two legs. Directed by Richard Cottrell and with Ian McKellen and Timothy West as Richard and Bolingbroke respectively, Lord Ross was played by Peter Rocca on the first half of the tour and David Calder on the second. In 1973, Charles Keating played Lord Ross to Richard Pasco and Ian Richardson&#x27;s king and Bolingbroke, in John Barton&#x27;s production. Ariane Mnouchkine&#x27;s 1984 production for the Théâtre du Soleil cast Robert Gourp as Lord Ross, and five years later the English Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production—directed by Michael Bogdanov—had John Dougall play him to Michael Pennington&#x27;s Richard. Keith Dunphy played Lord Ross in Steven Pimlott&#x27;s RSC production in 2000, to Sam West&#x27;s Richard and David Troughton&#x27;s Bolingbroke. A production at the Globe Theatre in 2015 from Tim Carroll saw Mark Rylance as the King and Ekow Quartey as Lord Ross. Jonathan Slinger played the King in Michael Boyd&#x27;s 2007 RSC production, and Rob Carroll played Lord Ross. Joshua Richards played him in Gregory Doran&#x27;s 2013 production, with David Tennant in the lead role.

After she retired from professional tennis in the 1970s, Berberyan started a coaching career. She was the coach of her three daughters, Katerina, Manuela and Magdalena, each of whom eventually became WTA top 10 players.

Throughout her professional career, Maleeva has won a total of 11 WTA singles titles and two titles in doubles. In July 1990, she achieved her career-high ranking of sixth. She has a record of 369 singles wins and 210 losses. In 1994, she married Georgi Stoimenov, before retiring in 1997. The couple have two children and currently live in Sofia.

<text>Jacob Jennings Brown (May 9, 1775 – February 24, 1828) was known for his victories as an American army officer in the War of 1812, where he reached the rank of general. His successes on the northern border during that war made him a national hero, and he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.

Even as the US Army was reduced in size after the war, Brown retained commissioned status. In 1821, Brown was appointed Commanding General of the United States Army and held that post until his death. He initiated post-graduate education for staff and command officers, and the General Recruiting Service, to manage acquiring troops. After his death, he received a military funeral in Washington, DC, with a mile-long parade along Pennsylvania Avenue to his burial at Congressional Cemetery.

== Early life ==
Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, Jacob Jennings Brown was the son of Samuel and Abi (White) Brown. His middle name was in honor of his paternal grandmother, a descendant of Samuel Jennings and his wife. Jennings had served as deputy governor of West Jersey and later receiver general of Pennsylvania in the early 18th century.

Raised a Quaker, Brown graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1790. He taught school for several years. In 1798, he moved to upstate New York, which was being settled and developed after the sale of thousands of acres of land formerly held by nations of the Iroquois Confederacy. Most had been forced to cede their lands and moved to a major reserve in Upper Canada.

Brown was a pioneer settler and landowner in the Black River country. He and his extended family established mills and a store, laid out roads and improved navigation on the lower Black River, which flowed into Lake Ontario.

== Military service ==

=== Apparent work for Alexander Hamilton ===
One biographer claimed Brown received early military training while serving as a military secretary to Alexander Hamilton during the winter of 1798–99. Hamilton was then organizing the U.S. Army for possible war with France. But Hamilton&#x27;s biographies say that he did not have a secretary, and biographical sketches of Brown published in 1815 do not mention a connection between him and Hamilton. As a major landowner, in 1807 Brown was commissioned as a captain in the 108th regiment of the New York Militia. Two years later, he was promoted to colonel. Militia officers including Brown served part time, and made their livings from farming and other occupations.

=== War of 1812===
The young American settlements along Lake Ontario had enjoyed a vigorous trade with Kingston and other Canadian sites before the United States imposed a boycott in 1808 on trade with Britain (and Canada) during rising tensions. Jacob Brown was nicknamed &quot;Potash Brown&quot; because of his activities as a smuggler of this product from Sackets Harbor, New York and along the Saint Lawrence River during this period. Sackets Harbor and other towns were the bases of widespread smuggling of goods with Canada.
During the War of 1812, Brown came to be characterized by his swift action and opportunism on the offensive. He also was known for directing meticulously planned, defensive field works, including for Sackets Harbor. His fortifications there were instrumental in fending off British and Canadian advances. Sackets Harbor had become a major military shipyard for construction of American naval war ships to sail on the Great Lakes, and its protection was critical. Some 3,000 shipyard workers were recruited to the shipyard, and thousands of federal troops were eventually bivouacked in the area. They overwhelmed the small town.

When the War of 1812 began, Brown was a brigadier general in the New York militia, having been appointed to that rank in 1811. Though he opposed the war, he organized defenses in the Great Lakes region. On May 29, 1813, troops led by Brown defeated the British at the Second Battle of Sackets Harbor, based on his fortifications. As a result of his actions there, Brown was commissioned as a brigadier general in the regular army.

The next year Brown showed his aggressiveness during the Niagara Campaign, beginning with the capture of Fort Erie on 3 July 1814 in Upper Canada after invasion by the Americans across the Niagara River. This was followed by the Battle of Chippawa on 5 July, when he achieved overwhelming success.

The following Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane on 25 July 1814, resulted in such high casualties on both sides that it was considered one of the bloodiest engagements of the war. It resulted in a stalemate. Brown was wounded twice in this engagement. Brigadier General Winfield Scott was serving under him and believed that Brown&#x27;s decision to refrain from fully committing his strength at the outset of this battle, resulted in the destruction of Scott&#x27;s brigade and a high number of unnecessary deaths.

Brown&#x27;s last battle of the war was the related Siege of Fort Erie, from 4 Aug to 21 Sep 1814, when the British tried unsuccessfully to take back control of the fort. He had directed fortifications to improve defenses at Fort Erie, which contributed to the American success in defeating the British. Brown was also considered impetuous. After the initial British assault against his forces was repulsed, Brown ordered a sortie on September 17 against the British that resulted in more than 500 casualties on each side, but changed nothing in the outcome of the siege. After both sides withdrew, the Americans destroyed Fort Erie so that it could no longer be used. Overall, Brown&#x27;s successes along the northern border made him a national hero.

===Postwar years===
After the war, the U.S. Army was reduced in size. By 1821, Brown was the only major general in the service, and President James Monroe made him commanding general. Despite a stroke suffered in 1821, Brown functioned well in his new post. He reorganized the army staff into the form it retained for the rest of the century. He advised the secretaries of war and presidents on military policy.

He also pushed to establish two post-graduate schools for the military, precursors of present-day staff and command colleges. Another first was his creation in 1822 of the General Recruiting Service; it was the first organization responsible for providing manpower for the Army.

== Death ==
On February 24, 1828, Brown died. He was given a military funeral: his casket was carried down Pennsylvania Avenue in the nation&#x27;s capital by a detachment of U.S. Marines. The government shut down to mark the day of his funeral. The mile-long funeral procession was composed of family, military detachments, and government officials. He was buried in the Congressional Cemetery, Washington, D.C.

President John Quincy Adams said of him:
General Brown was one of the eminent men of this age and nation. Though bred a Quaker, he was a man of lofty and martial spirit, and in the late war contributed perhaps more than any man to redeem and establish the military character of his country.
== Family ==
In December 1802, Brown married Pamelia Williams, then seventeen. They had four sons (Gouverneur, Jacob, William, and Nathan) and five daughters (Mary, Eliza, Pamela, Margaret and Katherine). Nathan was the only son to survive into a full adult life.

Brown&#x27;s first-born son, Gouverneur, drowned in an ice-skating accident at the age of twelve. Jacob (class of 1832) and William Spencer Brown (class of 1835), graduated from West Point. Jacob resigned after four years&#x27; service in the army, and William resigned after six months. Both died as young men.

Nathan W. Brown also had a successful military career. In 1849, at age thirty-one, Nathan was appointed as a major in the pay department. In 1864, during the Civil War, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and served as deputy paymaster general. In 1880 he was promoted to brigadier general and paymaster general; he retired in 1882 after 33 years in the army.

Eliza Brown married Edmund Kirby, who served as a colonel in the Mexican–American War, and a U.S. Army Paymaster. Their son Edmund also attended West Point, graduated in 1861, and was commissioned as an artillery officer. He served with the Army of the Potomac from First Bull Run through Chancellorsville, where he was severely wounded. Nominated for brigadier general by President Lincoln, he died before the Senate could confirm the promotion, at 23 years of age.

Pamela Brown married David Hammond Vinton, who served as assistant quartermaster general of the Union Army during the Civil War. Her younger sister Katherine married Larkin Smith, a Southerner and West Point classmate of their brother William. In 1861, Smith resigned his army commission to serve as assistant quartermaster general of the Confederate army.

== Legacy ==
For his victories in the War of 1812, Brown was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal on November 3, 1814. General Brown was the 24th American to receive this award.

In 1818, Brown was admitted as an honorary member of the New York Society of the Cincinnati.

Several counties, townships, towns, and schools were named after Jacob Jennings Brown, both in New York and in other states:

<text>John Ros, 7th Baron Ros of Helmsley (c.1397 – 22 March 1421) was an English nobleman.

He was the eldest son of William Ros, 6th Baron Ros, and Margaret Fitzalan (d. 3 July 1438), the daughter of John FitzAlan, 1st Baron Arundel, by Eleanor Maltravers (d. 3 July 1438), younger daughter and coheir of Sir John Maltravers.

He served as a soldier of Henry V of England during the Hundred Years&#x27; War. Six years after the Battle of Agincourt, John participated in the Battle of Baugé. He was among the casualties along with his brother William Ros, Thomas of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, the governor of Normandy and others. He was buried at the Belvoir Priory.

==Marriage==
John de Ros married Margery le Despencer, daughter and heiress of Philip le Despencer, 2nd Baron le Despencer, but had no issue by her. After his death, Margery married Roger Wentworth (d. 24 October 1452), esquire, younger son of John Wentworth of Elmsall, Yorkshire, by whom she had issue. She was fined £1000 for having contracted a dishonourable marriage far beneath her station.

<doc id="1096053" wikidata="Q7392639" url="?curid=1096053" title="SPQR series">
<text>The SPQR series is a series of historical mystery stories by John Maddox Roberts, published between 1990 and 2010, and set in the final years of the Roman Republic. SPQR (the original title of the first book, until the sequels came out) is a Latin initialism for &quot;Senatus Populusque Romanus&quot; (&quot;The Roman Senate and People&quot;), the official name of the Republic.

The stories are told in first-person form by Senator Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger (born c 90-95 BC), nephew of Metellus Pius and member of the powerful Caecilius Metellus family of the Roman Senate. The stories are told in flashback-form by the old Decius, writing during the reign of Augustus Caesar. The stories range from 70 BC (&quot;The King&#x27;s Gambit&quot;) to 20 BC (&quot;The King of Sacrifices&quot;), and have both an exciting and comedic tone.

Decius&#x27; companions include his slaves Cato, Cassandra, and Hermes; his friends, the Greek gladiatorial physician Asklepiodes and the gangster/politician Titus Annius Milo; and his staunch enemies, the siblings Clodia and Clodius. Along the way, he is often helped by his father, as well as by Cicero and a young Julius Caesar. In later books, Decius is betrothed and then married to the (fictional) niece of Caesar, Julia Caesaris. The dates are all listed at the end of each book in the &quot;ab urbe condita&quot; calendar system.

In 2015, a German company had planned to adapt the series for TV, however, they have withdrawn from the project in 2022 for financial reasons.

The series also includes the following short stories, in chronological order:

*&quot;The Statuette of Rhodes&quot; (60 BC): Decius finds a corpse at the base of the Colossus of Rhodes.
*&quot;Mightier Than the Sword&quot; (53 BC): Decius investigates the murder of a victim found in the basement of a townhouse in Rome.
*&quot;The Etruscan House&quot; (52 BC): Decius investigates a senator&#x27;s murder.
*&quot;An Academic Question&quot; (51 BC): Decius investigates a murder during his visit to Athens mentioned as part of his leisurely trip to Cyprus at the beginning of &quot;The Princess and the Pirates&quot;
*&quot;Venus in Pearls&quot; (46 BC): Caesar hires Decius to locate his stolen breastplate before his Pompeian triumph
*&quot;Beware the Snake&quot; (45 BC): Decius must locate the missing sacred snake of the Marsi.
*&quot;The Will&quot; (44 BC): Decius investigates Caesar&#x27;s will following his assassination.
*&quot;The King of Sacrifices&quot; (20 BC): An elderly Decius investigates the death of a candidate for Rex Sacrorum

Roberts also wrote a short story, &quot;The Mountain Wolves&quot;, which is also set in ancient Rome, but is not part of the SPQR series.

== Chronology ==
The above dates are approximate because there is contradictory information within the texts.
*For instance, in &quot;The Sacrilege&quot;, which can be dated at 62 BC, Decius claims to be turning 29, indicating he was born in 91 BC; however, in &quot;The Tribune&#x27;s Curse&quot;, he finds that he was born in the same year as Marcus Porcius Cato (95 BC). Confusingly, however, in the same book, Cato claims to have been born &quot;when Valerius and Herennius were consuls.&quot;, which was 93 BC.
*In &quot;The King of Sacrifices&quot;, dated at 20 BC, Decius claims to be in his 73rd year, indicating he was born in either 93 or 92 BC. However, in the story itself Julia is claimed to be &quot;betrothed&quot; to Agrippa, whom she married 21 BC, i.e. at least one year earlier. 
*The AUC dates given in &quot;The Sacrilege&quot;, &quot;The Temple of the Muses&quot; and &quot;The Statuette of Rhodes&quot; are clearly erroneous.
**The Sacrilege has a clear external date and there is a strong indication that &quot;Statuette&quot; takes place in the same year as &quot;Saturnalia&quot;.
*Roberts has noted that events in &quot;The Year of Confusion&quot; have been modified for dramatic effect.

<text>Nossrat Peseschkian (; born on June 18, 1933, in Kashan, Iran, – April 27, 2010, in Wiesbaden, Germany) lived in Germany since 1954. He was a specialist in neurology, psychiatry, psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine. Peseschkian founded positive psychotherapy in 1968 based on a cross-cultural approach; he was also the founder of the Wiesbaden Academy of Psychotherapy (WIAP), a German state-licensed postgraduate institute of psychotherapy.

==Biography==
Born and raised in Iran, Nossrat Peseschkian went to Germany in 1954 for his studies in medicine at the universities of Freiburg, Frankfurt am Main and Mainz. After his medical specialty training and dissertation, he did postgraduate training in psychotherapy in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and the United States. As an international lecturer, Peseschkian traveled to 67 countries. A global network of over fifty local, regional and national centers of positive psychotherapy has been established in 33 countries. Most of his trainings focused on Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Luxemburg.

Peseschkian authored 26 books on his technique; some of them have been translated into 23 languages. Pesechkian debuted his method of positive psychotherapy, a psychodynamic method with a cross-cultural and humanistic background, in 1968. In 1977, the German Association for Positive Psychotherapy was founded. Internationally, positive psychotherapy is represented by the World Association of Positive Psychotherapy. Swiss psychiatrist G. Benedetti explained in 1979: &quot;His model is a notable synthesis of psychodynamic and behavior-therapeutic elements, making an essential contribution to a unified relationship within psychotherapy&quot;.

Peseschkian was, up to the date of his death, the head of the International Academy for Positive and Transcultural Psychotherapy, the president of the World Association for Positive Psychotherapy, and Honorary President of the German Association for Positive Psychotherapy. He was an honorary professor at the National Psychoneurologic Institute Bechterew in St. Petersburg, Russia. In 1996, he received the Federal Order of Merit from the president of Germany. Peseschkian was a member of the Baháʼí Faith.

He was married to Manije Peseschkian (1940-2020), a family therapist. They had two sons, both physicians practicing psychiatry and psychotherapy (Hamid Peseschkian (b. 1962); Nawid Peseschkian (b. 1964)), and four grandchildren. His grave is in Wiesbaden-Sonnenberg, and was recognized by the Wiesbaden City Council on 17 March 2023 as a grave of honor.

==Death==
On 18 July, during the fifteenth stage of the 1995 Tour de France, Casartelli and a few other riders crashed on the descent of the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet mountain pass in the Pyrenees. Casartelli&#x27;s head struck the concrete blocks along the roadway, causing severe head injuries and loss of consciousness. Doctors arrived within ten seconds. While being flown to a local hospital by helicopter, Casartelli stopped breathing and after numerous resuscitation attempts was declared dead. It has been argued that Casartelli would have survived if he had been wearing a bicycle helmet. Gerard Porte, the Tour&#x27;s senior doctor, claimed that protection was academic since the fatal blow was to an area of Casartelli&#x27;s head that would not have been covered by a helmet. However Michel Disteldorf, the French doctor who examined Casartelli&#x27;s body on behalf of the coroner in Tarbes, where the rider was flown by helicopter after he crashed, told the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; that the point of impact was on the top of the skull, and that had Casartelli been wearing a hard helmet &quot;some injuries could have been avoided&quot;.

His Motorola team continued the Tour de France, crossing the finish line of the next stage first, side by side in Pau. The peloton followed behind, riding slowly. The Société du Tour de France awarded the stage prizes as normal, and the riders donated all the money won that day to a fund established for his family. The Tour later matched that amount, and thousands of individuals contributed to the fund.
Three days after the accident Fabio Casartelli&#x27;s teammate Lance Armstrong dedicated his stage win in Limoges to Casartelli by pointing at the sky as he rode over the finish line.

The Société du Tour de France and the Motorola team placed a memorial near where he crashed, situated at co-ordinates (42.940, 0.819). The memorial is a sundial arranged such that the sun&#x27;s shadow highlights three dates — his birth and death and 2 August, the day he won his Olympic gold medal. The bicycle he was riding at the time of his fatal crash was placed in the chapel at the Madonna del Ghisallo, a church and museum to cyclists near his home.

In 1997, the young rider classification in the Tour de France was renamed &quot;Souvenir Fabio Casartelli&quot; in his honour.

<doc id="1096075" wikidata="Q3652649" url="?curid=1096075" title="Mosaburō Suzuki">
<text>was a Japanese journalist, essayist, and socialist leader.

==Biography==
Mosaburō Suzuki was born on 7 February 1893, in Gamagōri, Aichi Prefecture. His family was poor, and he worked as a newspaper boy, shined shoes, and pulled rickshaws. He graduated with a degree in political economy at Waseda University in 1916. He worked as a newspaper reporter and covered the Japanese intervention in Siberia.

Suzuki moved to the United States in 1919, where he met Sen Katayama and Tsunao Inomata, who were both Leninists. He went to the Soviet Union as a correspondent for &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; in 1921, and returned to Japan in 1922. He unsuccessfully tried to organize miners in Kyushu. In 1922, he became a member of the newly-founded Japanese Communist Party (JCP). He became an economic expert for &quot;Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun&quot;, but was fired in 1928 for being too political. Suzuki was selected to serve as Secretary General of the Proletarian Masses Party in 1928. The party was a reconstitution of the Labour-Farmer Party, which was dissolved after the March 15 incident.

As Japan became increasingly militarist, Suzuki devoted most of his energies to the socialist movement starting around 1928. With Katō Kanjū, he formed the Proletarian Workers&#x27; Conference in 1936 and the Japan Proletarian Party in 1937. However, Suzuki became an increasingly prominent target of the government, and he was arrested in 1937 under the Peace Preservation Law as part of the Popular Front Incident. Suzuki was elected to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly in 1937. He was arrested again after Japan declared war on the United States and was imprisoned for a trial that never occurred.

Following Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, Suzuki participated in the formation of the Japan Socialist Party. In 1946, he won a seat in the House of Representatives; he became party secretary in 1949 and chairman in 1951. As chairman of the lower house&#x27;s Budget Committee in 1948, Suzuki passed a veto over Katayama Tetsu&#x27;s proposed budget, which later led to the downfall of the cabinet. Later, in his inaugural speech as party chairman, he famously said &quot;Young men, do not take up arms; young women, do not send your husbands and sons to the battlefield&quot; which caused a huge political stir and became a rallying cry of the pacifist movement in Japan, although it was only intended to rebuke Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru&#x27;s attempt to secure aid from the United States to rebuild the military of Japan.

After the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, the Socialist Party split into left and right wings. Suzuki remained chairman of the left wing, which had only 16 seats in the House of Representatives; in the 1955 elections, it jumped to 89 seats, thanks to support from the General Council of Trade Unions and popular support from a war-weary electorate that largely agreed with the party&#x27;s principle of unarmed neutrality.

The two socialist parties reunited that year to form a united front against the emerging right-wing conservative Liberal Democratic Party, but the issue of whether or not to participate in the Anpo protests reignited the left-right tension within the Socialist Party. In 1960, right-wing leader Suehiro Nishio left the party and formed the Democratic Socialist Party. Taking responsibility for the party split, Suzuki resigned as chairman.

During the 1960s, Suzuki gradually pressed the Socialist Party to the left, but it continued to languish as Japan&#x27;s economic recovery sped up. He retired from politics in 1967. Thereafter, he collected socialist literature and other materials, establishing a &quot;Socialist Library&quot; which he later donated to the Museum of Modern Japanese Literature. Suzuki died of liver cirrhosis in 1970.

<text>Macdonaldtown railway station is a partially heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Suburban line, serving the Sydney suburb of Eveleigh. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T2 Leppington &amp; Inner West Line and occasional T3 Liverpool &amp; Inner West Line services.

==History==
The original Macdonaldtown station opened in 1878 at a site adjacent to the Charles Street subway. It was relocated to its present site on 3 April 1892.

The Main Suburban line through Macdonaldtown was quadruplicated in 1892, and sextuplicated in 1927 in association with electrification works.

An island platform on the middle pair of tracks was taken out of use and demolished in November 1985. The closed access stairs to this may still be seen from the underpass entrance. To the south of the station, lie the Macdonaldtown Stabling Yards. A footbridge that spanned all six lines was removed in June 1996.

On the morning of 13 July 1986 Macdonaldtown station was painted pink by then 18 year-old John Philip Baxter and his 14-year-old brother. Baxter also glued a table, two chairs and a pot-plant (also painted pink) to the platform to further his &quot;overall effort to enhance the station&quot;. No conviction was recorded and the State Rail Authority&#x27;s claim for damages was rejected by the magistrate.

<doc id="1096080" wikidata="Q7737643" url="?curid=1096080" title="The Great American Novel (Roth novel)">
<text>The Great American Novel is a novel by Philip Roth, published in 1973.

==Summary==
The novel concerns the Patriot League, a fictional American baseball league, and the national Communist conspiracy to eliminate its history because it has become a fully open communist organization.

==Plot==
The Port Ruppert Mundys of New Jersey lease their stadium to the United States Department of War at the beginning of the 1943 season—to be used as a soldiers&#x27; embarkation point—which forces the athletes to play as the league&#x27;s first permanent road team. The novel&#x27;s narrator is &quot;Word&quot; Smith, a retired sports columnist who spends 1943 traveling with the Mundys.

==Replacement-era players==
Characters on the Mundys roster are parallels of actual replacement players from the World War II era, such as one-armed outfielder Bud Parusha (Pete Gray).

==Critical reception==
In 2003, &quot;USA Today&quot; critic Bob Minzesheimer called the work &quot;one of Roth&#x27;s least known,&quot; and added,

Daniel Okrent once wrote that if &quot;40 percent of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot; is out-of-control, the remainder is unmitigated triumph. Roth turned the screw of fantasy and myth one notch higher than others and ended up with a work far truer to the sport: He knew his target, loved it dearly, and knew as well what exaggerations it could withstand.&quot;
Roth, best known for &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; and &quot;American Pastoral&quot;, won a life-achievement medal last fall at the National Book Awards. At the reception, I told him how much I enjoyed &quot;The Great American Novel&quot; nearly 30 years ago. He laughed and said it&#x27;s usually the precocious teen sons of friends who tell him that. But he said no novel was more fun to write.

<text>Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, also known in Japan as , is a Japanese anime television series. It is a spin-off and sequel to the original &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; anime series, which itself is based on the original manga series of the same title by Kazuki Takahashi. It was broadcast for 180 episodes on TV Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2008. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; follows the exploits of Jaden Yuki (Judai Yuki in the Japanese versions) and his companions as he attends Duel Academia (Duel Academy in the 4Kids version). The series was released in English in North America by 4Kids Entertainment. A manga adaptation by Naoyuki Kageyama was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s magazine &quot;V Jump&quot; from December 2005 to March 2011, with its chapters collected in nine volumes. The series was followed by &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot; in 2008.

==Plot==

Taking place several years after the events of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; follows a new generation of duelists including a young boy named Jaden Yuki (Judai Yuki) who attends Duel Academy, a school founded by Seto Kaiba, where aspiring duelists train in the field of Duel Monsters. The academy has an internal ranking system based on the &quot;Egyptian God&quot; cards from Battle City. Obelisk Blue is the highest dorm and is filled with only the best duelists or those who come from elite families. Ra Yellow is the second-highest dorm and is made up of duelists who score and perform well in school and have the potential to be the best. Slifer Red is the lowest dorm and consists of those who do not perform well and need much help to improve. Students are able to graduate to the next dorm if they show improvement. In the universe of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, this series focuses on the type of summoning called &quot;Fusion Summon&quot;, which the protagonist and many characters perform.

For the first year at Duel Academy, Jaden befriends many students such as Syrus Truesdale (Sho Marufuji), Jaden&#x27;s roommate with low self esteem and Zane&#x27;s brother, Alexis Rhodes (Asuka Tenjoin), one of the top female duelists, Bastion Misawa (Daichi Misawa), an excellent duelist with an extremely high intellect, Chazz Princeton (Jun Manjoume), one of Jaden&#x27;s rivals with an elitist personality, and Zane Truesdale (Ryo Marufuji), Jaden&#x27;s other rival and the best duelist in the school. Together the main cast faced major threats including the Shadow Riders (Seven Stars), who intended to revive the Sacred Beasts, powerful cards that could destroy the world. This group was led by Kagemaru and consisted of Nightshroud (Alexis&#x27;s brother Atticus possessed by darkness), Camula (a vampire), Tania (an Amazon Warrior), Don Zaloog (a duel spirit), Abydos (an Egyptian pharaoh), Titan (an illusionist) and Amnael (an alchemist who posed as the Slifer Red&#x27;s dorm advisor, Professor Banner). After the Shadow Riders are defeated, Zane chooses Jaden to duel him in his graduation match which ends in the only draw of the series, after which he passes on the title of top duelist in the school to Jaden.

In the second year, Jaden meets Aster Phoenix (Edo Phoenix), a dueling prodigy, and Tyranno Hassleberry, a duelist with a love for the army and dinosaurs. The main cast then face off against the Society of Light, a cult-like organization who infiltrated Duel Academy. They are led by Sartorius, Aster&#x27;s manager, and intend to brainwash humanity with the powerful &quot;Light of Destruction&quot;, a light in space that has the ability to corrupt. It is revealed that when one duels someone from the Society of Light, they also become brainwashed and become one of their members. This caused many of Jaden&#x27;s friends, namely Chazz, Alexis, and Bastion, to become Jaden&#x27;s enemy. Jaden learns that he has the ability to talk to Duel Spirits (similar to Yugi Mutou) due to his ability to use the &quot;Gentle Darkness&quot;, a force created to balance out the Light of Destruction. He uses this to beat Sartorious and free everyone from the influence.

In the third year, Duel Academy is transported to another dimension, a desert plane with three suns and resident Duel Monster spirits, ruled by Yubel, a duel monster who was corrupted by the light. Upon returning home, Jaden and a select group of his partners dive back into the alternate dimension to recover their missing companions. After seeing his friends sacrificed, Jaden falls into despair and becomes possessed by the Supreme King, a ruthless and merciless ruler and the original wielder of the Gentle Darkness, which granted him immense power. During his time as the Supreme King, Jaden commits many crimes such as burning down villages, enslaving civilians, and sometimes even executing others. He is later freed of the influence by his friends in a duel, but is left with an immense amount of guilt. It is later revealed that Jaden in fact is the reincarnation of the Supreme King, and the Supreme King&#x27;s power is a part of him. Jaden faces off against Yubel and learns that Yubel actually was the guardian of the Supreme King who was sworn to always be with him and protect him. Yubel was driven insane by the Light of Destruction and wishes to fuse all dimensions together so she could always be with Jaden. Seeing that Yubel was just trying to fulfill her promise, Jaden decides to use &quot;Super Polymerization&quot; and fuse himself with Yubel to help fulfill that promise and cleanse her of her corruption.

Later in the third year, Jaden returns to Duel Academy for his graduation period. Since he fused himself with Yubel, he has gained her powers as well as her bi-chromatic eyes when he uses her powers. However, since he came back from the alternate dimension, he has become more solitary and distant from his friends as he does not wish to cause trouble for anyone anymore. He also lost his happy-go-lucky personality and his love for duelling; having endured such horrors over the past three years at Duel Academy, his belief that one duels for fun and enjoying themselves has been sapped out of him, and he only duels for survival. Despite this, Jaden is confronted by Nightshroud, the same spirit that possessed Atticus back in his first year, who tells Jaden that he will engulf this world in darkness by feeding off the negative emotions of humanity. Jaden originally fights off his minions until he comes face to face with Nightshroud himself. He duels him and successfully defeats him, freeing everyone of their darkness. During their remaining time, Jaden had slowly grown closer to his friends once again and began to reclaim his love for dueling, but on his final night, Jaden is going to leave the academy without saying goodbye. He is then stopped by an adult Yugi Mutou who transports him back in time for his &#x27;graduation match&#x27; against Yugi Mutou from the past. During this duel, Jaden reflects on his time at Duel Academy and the great friendships he has made along the way. He expresses his gratitude towards Yugi and officially reclaims his old personality and, spurred on by the opportunity to battle one of Yugi&#x27;s Egyptian God cards (in this case, Slifer the Sky Dragon), his love of dueling once again.

==Production==
&quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; is produced by Nihon Ad Systems and TV Tokyo, and the animation is handled by Studio Gallop. The series was directed by Hatsuki Tsuji and scripts were prepared by an alternating lineup of writers–Shin Yoshida, Atsushi Maekawa, Akemi Omode, Yasuyuki Suzuki–with music arrangements by Yutaka Minobe. Takuya Hiramitsu is in charge of sound direction, supervised by Yūji Mitsuya. Character and monster designs are overseen by Kenichi Hara, while Duel layout is overseen by Masahiro Hikokubo. The &quot;GX&quot; in the series&#x27; title is short for the term &quot;Generation neXt&quot;. &quot;GENEX&quot; was conceived as the series&#x27; original title, as can be evidenced in early promotional artwork. It also refers to the GX tournament that takes place between episodes 84 and 104.

A remastered version, to celebrate its 20th anniversary, is set to air on TV Tokyo starting in April 2025.

==Media==
===Anime===

The 180-episode series aired on TV Tokyo between October 6, 2004, and March 26, 2008, and was followed by &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot;.

It was subsequently licensed by 4Kids Entertainment and adapted into English, picked up by Cartoon Network and 4KidsTV in North America. Like previous 4Kids adaptations, several changes were made from the original Japanese version, including the names and personalities of characters, the soundtrack, the sound effects, the appearance of visuals such as Life Point counters, and the appearance of cards. The story and some of the visuals are also edited to remove references to death, blood, violence and religion in order to make the series suitable for a younger audience. Also any written language text, either Japanese or English is erased or replaced with unreadable content. These edits are also used in various localizations of the show in countries outside of Asia where 4Kids had distribution rights. For unknown reasons the US broadcast of the third season was first delayed from broadcast for two months after the conclusion of the second season, then its airing period extended to run over the course of 16 months until the end of August 2008. The last episode of the third season and the fourth season in its entirety were not dubbed for unknown reasons (possibly as consequence of the third season&#x27;s delays leading to too large of an episode gap between the Japanese and North American airing schedules), leaving them for many years as Japanese-exclusive; with &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot; beginning to be run in September 2008, three weeks after the US broadcast airing of GX season 3&#x27;s last dubbed episode.

Dubbed episodes were uploaded onto 4Kids&#x27; YouTube page until March 29, 2011, when Nihon Ad Systems and TV Tokyo sued 4Kids and terminated the licensing agreement for the franchise. The series is currently licensed by 4K Media Inc. Hulu and Crunchyroll are currently streaming dubbed episodes, with the latter beginning to stream the subtitled Japanese version of the series in August 2015.

===Manga===

Written and illustrated by Naoyuki Kageyama, under supervision by Kazuki Takahashi, the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; manga series was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;V Jump&quot; magazine from December 17, 2005, to March 19, 2011. Shueisha collected its chapters in nine volumes, released from November 2, 2006, to June 3, 2011. A one-shot was published in &quot;V Jump&quot; on June 21, 2014.

In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media. The series ran in the &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; manga anthology from the January 2007 to the January 2010 issues. Viz Media released the nine volumes from November 6, 2007, to August 7, 2012.

===Video games===

Several video games based on &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; have been developed and published by Konami.

Two games were released for Game Boy Advance; &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Ultimate Masters: World Championship Tournament 2006&quot;, and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Duel Academy.&quot;

Three games have been released for Nintendo DS; &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX Spirit Caller&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters World Championship 2007&quot; and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! World Championship 2008&quot;. A fourth title, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX Card Almanac&quot;, is not actually a game, but a catalog of cards up to 2007.

The &quot;Tag Force&quot; series has appeared on the PlayStation Portable, which adds the ability to form tag team duels, with the first three games in the series being based on the &quot;GX&quot; series (subsequent games are based on &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot;). The titles are &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2&quot; and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 3&quot;. The first game was also ported to PlayStation 2 as &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX: Tag Force Evolution&quot;. So far, &quot;Tag Force 3&quot; has not been released in North America. It was however, released in Europe, and its follow up, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s Tag Force 4&quot;, has been released in all regions including North America.

===Other media===
In 2007, Eaglemoss productions signed a deal to release a magazine based upon the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; franchise named &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Ultimate Guide&quot;.

The artist Inu Mayuge wrote a &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot; parody titled , posted in &quot;V Jump&quot; on June 25, 2009.

<doc id="1096102" wikidata="Q135771" url="?curid=1096102" title="Z Pulsed Power Facility">
<text>The Z Pulsed Power Facility, informally known as the Z machine or simply Z, is the largest high frequency electromagnetic wave generator in the world, operated by Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

It has primarily been used as an inertial confinement fusion (ICF) research facility, including the magnetized liner inertial fusion (MagLIF) approach, and for testing materials in conditions of extreme temperature and pressure.
In particular, it gathers data to aid in computer modeling of nuclear weapons and eventual fusion pulsed power plants.

==History==

The Z machine&#x27;s origins can be traced to the Department of Energy (DoE) needing to replicate the fusion reactions of a thermonuclear bomb in a lab environment to better understand the physics involved.
Since the 1970s, the DoE has also been looking into ways to generate electricity from fusion reactions.

The first research at Sandia, headed by Gerold Yonas – the particle-beam fusion program – dates back to 1971. This program tried to generate fusion by compressing fuel with beams of charged particles. Electrons were the first particles to be thought of, because the pulsed power accelerators at the time had already concentrated them at high power in small areas. However, shortly thereafter it was realized that electrons can not possibly heat the fusion fuel rapidly enough for the purpose. The program then moved away from electrons in favor of protons. These turned out to be too light to control well enough to concentrate onto a target, and the program moved on to light ions, lithium. The accelerators names reflect the change in emphasis: first
the accelerator&#x27;s name was EBFA-I (electron beam fusion accelerator), shortly thereafter PBFA-I, which became Saturn. Protons demanded another accelerator, PBFA-II, which became Z.

The November 1978 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot; carried Yonas&#x27; first general-public article, &quot;Fusion power with particle beams&quot;.

In 1985, the PBFA-II was created. Sandia continued to target heavy ion fusion at a slow pace despite the National Academies report.

Meanwhile, defense-related research was also ongoing at Sandia with the Hermes III machine and Saturn (1987), upgraded from PBFA-I, which operated at lower total power than PBFA-II but advanced Sandia&#x27;s knowledge in high voltage and high current and was therefore a useful predecessor to the Z machine.

Also in 1996, the PBFA-II machine was once again upgraded into PBFA-Z or simply &quot;Z machine&quot;, described for the first time to the general public in August 1998 in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

==Physics of the Z machine==
The Z machine uses the well known principle of Z-pinch to produce hot short-lived plasmas. The plasma can be used as a source of x-rays, as a surrogate for the inside of a thermonuclear weapon, or as a surrogate for the core of a fusion power plant.

In a Z-pinch, the fast discharge of current through a column of plasma causes it to be compressed towards its axis by the resulting Lorentz forces, thus heating it. Willard Harrison Bennett successfully researched the application of Z-pinches to plasma compression. The Z machine layout is cylindrical. On the outside it houses huge capacitors discharging through Marx generators which generate a one microsecond high-voltage pulse. This pulse is then compressed by a factor of 10 to enable the creation of 100 ns discharges.

Most experiments on the Z machine run the current discharge through a conductive tube (called a &quot;liner&quot;) filled with gas. This approach is known as magnetized liner inertial fusion, or MagLIF. The compression of a MagLIF Z-pinch is limited because the current flow is highly unstable and rotates along the cylinder which causes twisting of the imploding tube therefore decreasing the quality of the compression.

The Z machine has also conducted experiments with arrays of tungsten wires rather than liners. The space inside the wire array was filled with polystyrene, which helps homogenize the X-ray flux. By removing the polystyrene core, Sandia was able to obtain a thin 1.5 mm plasma cord in which 10 million amperes flowed with 90 megabars of pressure.

==Early operation 1996–2006==
The key attributes of Sandia&#x27;s Z machine are its 18 million amperes of current and a discharge time of less than 100 nanoseconds. This current discharge was initially run through an array of tungsten wires.
In 1999, Sandia tested the idea of nested wire arrays; the second array, out of phase with the first, compensates for Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities.
In 2001, Sandia introduced the Z-Beamlet laser (from surplus equipment of the National Ignition Facility) as a tool to better image the compressing pellet. This confirmed the shaping uniformity of pellets compressed by the Z machine.

In 1999, Sandia started the Z-IFE project, which aimed to solve the practical difficulties in harnessing fusion power. Major problems included producing energy in a single Z-pinch shot, and quickly reloading the reactor after each shot. By their early estimates, an implosion of a fuel capsule every 10 seconds could economically produce 300 MW of fusion energy.

Sandia announced the fusing of small amounts of deuterium in the Z machine on April 7, 2003.

Besides being used as an X-ray generator, the Z machine propelled small plates at 34 kilometers a second, faster than the 30 kilometers per second that Earth travels in its orbit around the Sun, and four times Earth&#x27;s escape velocity (3 times it at sea level). It also successfully created a special, hyperdense &quot;hot ice&quot; known as ice VII, by quickly compressing water to pressures of 70,000 to 120,000 atmospheres (7 to 12 GPa). Mechanical shock from impacting Z-machine accelerated projectiles is able to melt diamonds.

During this period the power of X-ray produced jumped from 10 to 300TW. In order to target the next milestone of fusion breakeven, another upgrade was then necessary

== After refurbishment (2007–) ==

A $60 million (raised to $90 million) retrofit program called ZR (Z Refurbished) was announced in 2004 to increase its power by 50%. The Z machine was dismantled in July 2006 for this upgrade, including the installation of newly designed hardware and components and more powerful Marx generators. The deionized water section of the machine has been reduced to about half the previous size while the oil section has been expanded significantly in order to house larger intermediate storage lines (i-stores) and new laser towers, which used to sit in the water section. The refurbishment was completed in October 2007.
The newer Z machine can now shoot around 26 million amperes (instead of 18 million amperes previously) in 95 nanoseconds. The radiated power has been raised to 350 terawatts and the X-ray energy output to 2.7 megajoules. In 2006 wire array experiments reach ultra-high temperatures (2.66 to 3.7 billion kelvins).

Sandia&#x27;s roadmap for the future includes another Z machine version called ZN (Z Neutron) to test higher yields in fusion power and automation systems. ZN is planned to give between 20 and 30 MJ of hydrogen fusion power with a shot per hour using a Russian Linear Transformer Driver (LTD) replacing the current Marx generators. After 8 to 10 years of operation, ZN would become a transmutation pilot plant capable of a fusion shot every 100 seconds.

The next step planned would be the Z-IFE (Z-inertial fusion energy) test facility, the first true z-pinch driven prototype fusion power plant. It is suggested it would integrate Sandia&#x27;s latest designs using LTDs. Sandia Labs recently proposed a conceptual 1 petawatt (1015 watts) LTD Z-pinch power plant, where the electric discharge would reach 70 million amperes. As of 2012, fusion shot simulations at 60 to 70 million amperes are showing a 100 to 1000 fold return on input energy. Tests at the Z machine&#x27;s current design maximum of 26-27 million amperes were set to begin in 2013.

<text>Thomas Ros or Roos, 9th Baron Ros of Helmsley (9 September 1427 – 17 May 1464) was a follower of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses.

==Family==

Thomas Ros, born 9 September 1427, was the eldest son of Thomas Ros, 8th Baron Ros and Eleanor Beauchamp, second daughter of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and his first wife, Elizabeth Berkeley, daughter and heiress of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley. Eleanor was an older half-sister of Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick, and Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick.

Thomas himself was an older maternal half-brother to Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, and Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset.

==Career==
Thomas had inherited the barony of Ros when he was barely four years old. His great uncle, Sir Robert Ros, knight, was deputed to perform the office of chamberlain to Archbishop Stafford, on the day of his installation at Canterbury; this office belonged to Lord Ros, from his tenure of the manor of Hethfield, in Kent. The fee for this service was the furniture of the room, and the basin and towel. The manor, and tenure on which it was held, came to the Ros family, from the marriage of an ancestor with Margaret Badlesmere.

Thomas Lord Ros was only eighteen years of age when he was put by the king into full possession of his father&#x27;s estates. Having been faithful to King Henry VI of England throughout his disputed reign, he was rewarded with certain commercial privileges, consisting, chiefly, of an entire remission of the customary duties on exported wool. In 1456, he had permission to go on a pilgrimage, and in 1460, the king settled on him, as in part, a recompense for the expenses and losses incurred in his service, an annuity of £40, arising out of certain manors forfeited by the Earl of Salisbury.

By at least one near-contemporary account (&quot;Whethamstead&#x27;s Register&quot;), in the same year he was part of the Lancastrian army which was victorious at the Battle of Wakefield. In February 1461, he was one of the knights made after another Lancastrian victory at the Second Battle of St Albans by Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales. Later that year he was with the king at York when news arrived of the Lancastrian defeat at the Battle of Towton, and he accompanied the king in his flight to Berwick.

As a loyal supporter of Henry VI, Ros was attainted in Parliament on 4 November 1461. He led a section of the Lancastrian army which attacked John Neville&#x27;s army at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April, where his men fled, and then took part in the Battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464. The Lancastrian army was crushed by Neville; Ros was subsequently found hiding with lord Hungerford in a wood. He was beheaded the next day at Newcastle for treason, and the Ros lands were confiscated. Belvoir Castle was given to William, Lord Hastings.

==Marriage and children==
Thomas Ros married Philippa Tiptoft, daughter of John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft, by whom he had one son and four daughters:
*Edmund Ros, 10th Baron Ros.
*Eleanor Ros, who married Sir Robert Manners of Etal, Northumberland.
*Isabel Ros, who married firstly Sir Thomas Everingham, secondly Sir Thomas Grey, and thirdly Sir Thomas Lovell.
*Margaret Ros 
*Joan Ros.

On 20 August 1471, his widow Philippa married secondly (in the presence of the then duke and duchess of Suffolk), the English diplomat Edward Grimston as his third wife.

<text>Edmund Ros or Roos, 10th Baron Ros of Helmsley (c. 1455 – 23 October 1508) was a follower of the House of Lancaster during the Wars of the Roses. He regained his family title after the accession of King Henry VII of England.

==Family==
Edmund de Ros, born about 1455, was the only son of Thomas Ros, 9th Baron Ros (9 September 1427 – 17 May 1464), and Philippa Tiptoft (c. 1423 – after 30 January 1487), daughter of John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft and Powis. He had four sisters:

*Eleanor Ros, who married Sir Robert Manners of Etal, Northumberland. Their son was George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros.
*Isabel Ros, who married firstly Sir Thomas Everingham, secondly Sir Thomas Grey, and thirdly Sir Thomas Lovell.
*Margaret Ros.
*Joan Ros.

After the death of the 9th Baron, his widow, Philippa, married firstly Sir Thomas Wingfield (d. 1471), by whom she had no issue. After his death, she married Edward Grimston, esquire, (d. 23 September 1478).

==Career==
As a result of his father&#x27;s attainder, he went into exile. Under Henry VII, who united the houses of York and Lancaster, the attainder was reversed; and Edmund, Lord Ros, was reinstated in his ancestral property; Belvoir had been in the possession of the Hastings family for more than twenty years. In the petition to parliament presented by Lord Ros in November 1485, his claims are stated with great moderation, and his sufferings for his loyalty to King Henry VI are not overstated.

About nine years later, Sir Thomas Lovell, who had married Isabel, Edmund&#x27;s sister, presented a petition to parliament, stating that Edmund was &quot;not of sufficient discretion to guide himself and his livelihood; nor able to serve his sovereign after his duty&quot; and asking &quot;that he might have the guidance and governance of the said Edmund&quot; and all his property. An Act of Parliament was passed giving full powers to Sir Thomas Lovell over the person and property of Lord Ros, and entire possession of the latter at his death upon trust for the other relatives of Lord Ros, reserving only a rent of seven hundred marks to the King, and the right, title, and interest of those who have, or ought to have, possession or occupation of certain portions of the property.

Edmund, Lord Ros, lived at the manor of Elsinges, at Enfield, which he had inherited from his mother, and was probably kept under restraint. On his death, he was buried in the parish church at Enfield, on the north side of the altar, where his monument is an arch erected over the tomb of Lady Joyce Tiptoft, his maternal grandmother, and charged with the arms of Ros quartering Badlesmere. Since Edmund had no children, his sisters were his heirs, and Elsinges became the property of his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Lovell, who, at his death in 1524 bequeathed it to his great-nephew, Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, in 1526. Eleanor, the eldest sister and co-heir of Edmund, Lord Ros, married Sir Robert Manners (d. 1495), of Etal, Northumberland. Eleanor was therefore the grandmother of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland.

<text>Winter Quarters was an encampment formed by approximately 2,500 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as they waited during the winter of 1846–47 for better conditions for their trek westward. It followed a preliminary tent settlement some 3½ miles west at Cutler&#x27;s Park. Members of the Church built more than 800 cabins at the Winter Quarters settlement. Located in present-day North Omaha overlooking the Missouri River, the settlement remained populated until 1848.

==History==

Wintering Latter-day Saints had been driven from their homes in Nauvoo, Illinois by mobs. Forced to leave on relatively short notice, they were unable to bring many useful supplies. Influential non-member Thomas L. Kane, seeking to convince the Latter-day Saints’ leaders to establish a volunteer military group (later known as the Mormon Battalion), received permission from the federal government for the group to encamp in Omaha Tribe lands, including the site of Cutler&#x27;s Park. Conditions at the settlement remained primitive the first month, with pioneers living in tents while the men put up hay, found water and managed the cattle.

Due to arguments among the Oto and Omaha tribes over use of the land, the Latter-day Saints moved their camp three miles east to a site overlooking the Missouri River. There they built cabins and sod houses for the winter. One group of cabins became known as Kimball Row. It consisted of thirteen adjacent cabins, with the homes of church leaders Heber C. Kimball and Newel K. Whitney at either end. The Latter-day Saints actively traded with American Indian and trading settlements in northern Missouri and Iowa, exchanging household goods and small amounts of cash for foodstuffs, such as hogs, grain and vegetables, and supplies for the emigration effort. Young Latter-day Saint men also produced handcrafted items such as willow baskets and washboards for sale. Church funds also allowed the community to build a much needed water-powered gristmill.

Even with trade, diet in the camp was mainly corn bread, salt bacon and a little milk, with occasional fresh game or domestic meat. Scurvy, known as &quot;blackleg&quot; during this period, became a major problem. Missouri potatoes and horseradish found at old Fort Atkinson helped ease the level of disease, but all residents lacked fresh vegetables in their diet. Tuberculosis (known as consumption), malaria, and unidentified fevers and chills also plagued the temporary settlement. Church member Louisa Barnes Pratt recalled in her memoirs:
 
Church records for the first summer do not contain information on disease victims; however, later records indicate that, from mid-September 1846 to May 1848, disease caused the deaths of 359 residents.

Brigham Young supervised construction of the Florence Mill. It is reportedly the only surviving building in the area to have been built by the Latter-day Saint camp. The settlers needed a mill to grind corn, wheat, and rye to create cornmeal and flour products. Constructed next to Turkey Creek, later called Mill Creek, which flowed into the Missouri River, the original structure was started in the fall of 1846. It was completed by the spring of 1847 at the cost of $3,000. Brigham Young sold this mill to John Neff, who left it when he also moved to Salt Lake City. Later settlers renovated and used the mill for years. Evidence of the original construction techniques has been found in the surviving Florence Mill.

The area that was once Winter Quarters became part of the community of Florence, located in North Omaha. The pioneer community is remembered with several attractions, including the Mormon Pioneer Cemetery, Cutler&#x27;s Park, Mormon Trail Center and the Mormon Pioneer Memorial Bridge. The Winter Quarters Nebraska Temple was dedicated there on Sunday, April 22nd, 2001.

<text>Hindu Makkal Katchi (HMK), literally meaning Hindu People&#x27;s Party, also pronounced as Indu Makkal Katchi (IMK), is a right-wing, Hindu nationalist party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

The organisation was set up by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a front for its political activities in Tamil Nadu. Since its formation served as the platform for RSS and its subsidiaries known as the Sangh Parivar.

==Formation==
Hindu Munnani, the parent organization of Hindu Makkal Katchi was set up by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a front for its political activities in Tamil Nadu. Hindu Munnani org was founded in 1980 by Rama Gopalan, a member of R.S.S. and since its formation served as the platform for RSS and its subsidiaries known as the Sangh Parivar.

The organisation promoted a Hindu communal identity and used it as a political mobilisation strategy. In the early 1990s, the AIADMK Jayalalitha government (1991–1996) tilted towards Hindutva, in reaction to the vote-bank politics of DMK. Jayalalitha-led government supported the activities of Hindu Munnani in organizing Vinayaka Chathurthi processions in major cities of Tamil Nadu. The state government&#x27;s support of Rama Gopalan&#x27;s activity made him a follower of Jayalalitha. Due to this proximity, a faction of Hindu Munnani broke away and found another group named Hindu Makkal Katchi under the leadership of S.V. Sridhar in 1993. The militants of the two groups used vituperative and abusive language against the Muslims. The provocative speeches against Islam and Muhammad polarized the social atmosphere of the region. Their anti-Muslim speeches and activities led to formation of Muslim group Al Umma.

The activities of RSS, Hindu Munnani and Hindu Makkal Katchi continued uninterrupted under Jayalalitha. The BJP alliance with AIADMK led to further spread of RSS ideology in Tamil Nadu. These organisations used religious festivals to combine their strength and caused riots.

== Activities ==
Due to various extremist actions, the party was repeatedly in conflict with the law. Its leader Arjun Sampath was arrested in 1997 on an attempted murder charge.

Hindu Makkal Katchi staged demonstrations on 29 October 2017 in front of theatres across Tamil Nadu in protest against freedom of speech i.e. &#x27;objectionable sentences&#x27; about Goods and Services Tax in actor Vijay&#x27;s &#x27;Mersal&#x27;. HMK leader Arjun Sampath led a demonstration in front of a theatre in Kumbakonam and demanded removal of the &#x27;controversial sentences&#x27;. Party activists tore up banners of Vijay and movie director Atlee. In Tiruchirapalli, HMK members staged a demonstration in front of a theatre, while similar protests were held at Ottenchathram in Dindigul and in Chennai. The movie ran into trouble soon after its 18 October 2017 release, coinciding with Diwali, over &#x27;incorrect references&#x27; to the GST.

In 2008 and 2009 party members were temporarily arrested by the police to block them from staging nationalistic demonstrations on the island of Kachchatheevu, which belongs to Sri Lanka.

In 2009, some Tamil fishermen were arrested by Sri Lankan Navy. To protect them, HMK supporters started agitations and pressurized Indian Govt to take responsibility of them and rescue them from Sri Lanka. When former Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram visited Tamil Nadu, HMK supporters showed black flag as central government failed to rescue the Tamil fisherman from the Sri Lankan navy. 19 supporters were arrested and removed from the Gandhi park area by police. Not only Sri Lanka issue they also sought about handling problems in bilateral relations with Pakistan and China.

The party also made repeatedly headlines with peaceful charges against women. It pressed charges against the movie stars Khushbu Sundar (2006), Shriya Saran (2008) and Mallika Sherawat (2008) for &quot;indecent dressing&quot; and &quot;offending Hindu values&quot;. Party members also harassed women visiting pubs and young couples being out on Valentine&#x27;s Day.

The Party&#x27;s president Arjun Sampath claimed that 1000 Dalit Christians will be reconverted to Hinduism at Tirunelveli which gains significance in the backdrop 9 March police shootout in which two people were killed when clashes broke out between the members of upper caste Catholics and Dalit Catholics.

The party&#x27;s five activists were arrested for indulging in demolition of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy&#x27;s statue installed in front of the Rajagopuram of the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple in Srirangam.

In 2017, Hindu Makkal Katchi leader strongly opposed the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#x27;s second time visit to Sri Lanka next month, where he was going to participate in the United Nations Vesak Celebrations which was held from 12 to 14 May 2017. This &#x27;International Day of Vesak&#x27; was hosted by the Buddhist-majority country and the commemorations in Colombo was also include an International Buddhist Conference in which over 400 delegates from more than 100 countries.

In November 2019, Hindu Makkal Katchi leader Arjun Sampath was detained following his draping of saffron shawl on Thiruvalluvar statue in Pillayarpatti, Thanjavur. This is read as an attempt at saffronization of Thiruvalluvar.

They were instrumental in bringing back Lakshmi, the temple elephant at Manakula Vinayagar Temple in Puduchery. Lakshmi was taken away by PETA and the Animal Welfare Board and accused the Temple of violating the Prevention of Cruelty to animals and the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. She was relocated to Krishi Vigyan Kendra at Kurumamber, where her health was reported to have deteriorated.

== Attacks against Hindu Makkal Katchi ==
In February 2023, Manikandan, the south district deputy head of the Hindu Makkal Katchi was killed by a gang in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. Police said that the accused escaped after committing the crime.

In March 2020, a group attacked Nandakumar, Tirupur north district deputy secretary of HMK. Police said that the group escaped after the attack.

In September 2018, the Coimbatore city police, arrested five persons (Jafar Safiq Ali (29) of Vysarpadi, Ismail (25) of Tindivanam, Samsudeen (20) and Shalavuddin (25) of Pallavaram, and Ashik (25) of Coimbatore) for planning to kill HMK leader Arjun Sampath and his son, Omkar Balaji. Coimbatore city police said that one of the accused, Ashik, was facing many cases, including the kidnapping of girls.

In January 2018, a gang threw petrol bombs at the house of HMK south zone organizing president, Balamurugan, in Sivaganga. Police said that the men came in a motorbike, threw bombs, and fled.

In July 2014, a group attempted to attack HMK spokesperson Sendhur Pandi, at Kenikarai. Police identified the attackers as Sadam Hussain (25), Mohamed Nizarudhin (23) and a 16-year-old boy, who were later arrested.

<doc id="1096127" wikidata="Q702142" url="?curid=1096127" title="Battle of Vella Gulf">
<text>The was a naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II fought on the night of 6–7 August 1943 in Vella Gulf between Vella Lavella and Kolombangara in the Solomon Islands of the southwest Pacific.

This engagement was the first time that American destroyers were allowed to operate independently of the American cruiser force during the Pacific campaign.

In the battle, six American destroyers had intelligence that a Japanese group was coming to Vella Gulf on that night, and laid in wait for them. They engaged four Japanese destroyers and three cruisers attempting to reinforce Japanese troops on Kolombangara. The American warships put an island with mountains at their backs, because the Japanese could not discriminate ships from the island due to the poor quality of their radar. The group then closed the Japanese force undetected with the aid of radar, turned broadside in a line, and fired a full salvo of torpedoes. At the same time, they opened fire with main guns, and reloaded torpedoes and continued firing. They sank three Japanese destroyers, damaged two cruisers, and killed an estimated 3,100 Japanese sailors and soldiers. The American ships did not get hit by even a single bullet.

==Background==
After their victory in the Battle of Kolombangara on 13 July 1943, the Japanese had established a powerful garrison of 12,400 around Vila on the southern tip of Kolombangara in an attempt to block further island hopping by the American forces, which had taken Guadalcanal the previous year as part of Operation Cartwheel. Vila was the principal port on Kolombangara, and it was supplied at night using fast destroyer transport runs the Americans called the &quot;Tokyo Express&quot;. Three supply runs—on 19 July, 29 July, and 1 August—were completed.

During the final run on 1 August, a force of 15 U.S. PT boats launched an unsuccessful attack, firing between 26 and 30 torpedoes. Four Japanese destroyers responded, and in the ensuing battle &quot;PT-109&quot;, captained by Lieutenant John F. Kennedy, later President of the United States, was rammed and sunk by . By 5 August, the Americans were driving towards the Japanese-held airfield at Munda on New Georgia just south of Kolombangara, and the Japanese decided to send a fourth transport run to Vila with reinforcements.

==Battle==
On the night of 6 August, the Imperial Japanese Navy sent a force of four destroyers under Captain Kaju Sugiura—2 : , and 2 : of Sugiara&#x27;s own Destroyer Division 4 and of Captain Tameichi Hara&#x27;s Destroyer Division 27—carrying about 950 soldiers and their supplies. The Japanese airfield at Munda, which the force at Vila was assigned to reinforce, was on the verge of being captured; it actually fell later that day. The Imperial Japanese commanders expected that Vila would become the center of their next line of defense. The Japanese operational plan specified the same approach route through Vella Gulf as the three previous successful transport runs over the objections of Hara, who argued that repeating prior operations was courting disaster.

The U.S. Navy Task Group 31.2 (TG 31.2) of six destroyers—, , , , , and —commanded by Commander Frederick Moosbrugger, having been forewarned of the Japanese operation, was dispatched to intercept the Japanese force. The morale of Moosbrugger&#x27;s crews was buoyed by the realization that at last they would be free of the combat doctrine that required them to stick close to the cruisers; on this night, they would be able to apply their own tactics.

The U.S. ships made radar contact with the Japanese force at 23:33 on 6 August. Moosbrugger&#x27;s battle plan divided his forces into two divisions. Moosbrugger&#x27;s own Destroyer Division 12 (&quot;Dunlap&quot;, &quot;Craven&quot; and &quot;Maury&quot;), whose ships retained their full pre-war torpedo batteries, was to launch a surprise torpedo attack out of the shadow of Kolombangara. Meanwhile, Commander Roger Simpson&#x27;s Destroyer Division 15 (&quot;Lang&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot; and &quot;Stack&quot;), whose ships had exchanged some of their torpedo tubes for extra 40 mm guns, was to cover Moosburger&#x27;s division from an overwatch position, turning to cross the enemy&#x27;s course. The idea was that any attempt by the Japanese to turn into the first division&#x27;s torpedo attack would expose their broadsides to torpedo attack from the second division.

The two divisions could then switch roles if a repeat torpedo attack proved necessary, or alternate roles if barges were encountered, which could be dealt with by the second division&#x27;s extra guns if necessary. Having learned the harsh lessons of naval combat at night after the Battle of Kolombangara, the Battle of Kula Gulf, and a previous PT boat skirmish, and having finally addressed the technical problems that had plagued their Mark 15 torpedoes since the beginning of the war, the American destroyers did not give away their position with gunfire until their torpedoes started striking their targets.

&quot;Dunlap&quot;, &quot;Craven&quot; and &quot;Maury&quot; fired a total of 24 torpedoes in the space of 63 seconds before turning to starboard and withdrawing at high speed, using the mountainous island to their east to help camouflage their movements. The Americans were operating on the assumption that the Japanese had nothing to match their new centimetric SG radar; they knew that their older meter band radars could not differentiate between the surface ships and the island and presumed Japanese radars were no better. In the event, none of the Japanese ships present actually had radar, and the looming mass of the island served to conceal the American ships from visual observation. &quot;Lang&quot;, &quot;Sterett&quot; and &quot;Stack&quot; turned to port to cross their opponent&#x27;s T and opened fire as soon as the torpedoes started detonating. All four Japanese destroyers were hit by American torpedoes. &quot;Hagikaze&quot;, &quot;Arashi&quot;, and &quot;Kawakaze&quot; burst into flames and either sank immediately or were quickly sunk by naval gunfire. The torpedo that hit &quot;Shigure&quot; was a dud that passed through her rudder without detonating, allowing her to escape into the darkness. &quot;Shigure&quot; fired eight torpedoes while it retreated from the scene, all of which missed their targets.

==Aftermath==

Many of the Japanese soldiers and sailors left floating in the water after their ships sank refused rescue by American ships. A total of 685 Japanese soldiers were lost, mostly by drowning. In addition, 356 sailors were lost on &quot;Hagikaze&quot; and &quot;Arashi&quot; (178 on each) and 169 on &quot;Kawakaze&quot;. A small group of 300 survivors reached Vella Lavella. They were later transferred to Kolombangara. During this battle, no U.S. ship was struck, with the only casualty being a crush injury to a gun loader caused by an accident.

The battle—coming less than one month after the night action at the Battle of Kolombangara—was the first time that the Japanese had been beaten in a night destroyer action. The six destroyers had accomplished what a squadron of 15 American PT boats could not shortly before: sink the Tokyo Express with torpedoes with no American or friendly navy losses. The Empire of Japan could no longer supply their garrison on Kolombangara, and the Allies bypassed it, landing instead on Vella Lavella to the west on 15 August. The Japanese Army soon abandoned Kolombangara, completing their withdrawal by early October.

Two of the US destroyer captains, Lieutenant Commanders Clifton Iverson (&quot;Dunlap&quot;) and Frank Gardner Gould (&quot;Sterett&quot;), were later awarded the Navy Cross for their actions during the battle.

==Namesakes==
The escort aircraft carrier , in commission from 1945 to 1946, and the guided-missile cruiser , in commission from 1993 to 2022, were named for this battle.

<text>Richard Butler (April 1, 1743 – November 4, 1791) was an Anglo-Irish officer in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War who was later killed while fighting Native Americans at the Battle of the Wabash.

==Family==
Born in St. Bridget&#x27;s Parish, Dublin, Ireland, Butler was the oldest son of Thomas and Eleanor (Parker) Butler. Thomas Butler was an aristocrat who served in the British army. He was the brother of Colonel Thomas Butler and Captain Edward Butler. All three brothers served in the American Revolution and in the Northwest Indian War against the Western Confederacy of Native American tribes in the Northwest Territories. His two other brothers, William and Percival, served in the Revolution but did not see later military service.

==Early life==
In 1748 Butler&#x27;s father opened a gun shop in Dublin, but that same year the family moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he learned to make the Pennsylvania long rifles used in the French and Indian War.

By 1760, the family had moved to the frontier at Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where Thomas and his sons manufactured long rifles and became friends with Daniel Morgan. The Butler gun shop still stands in Carlisle.

By the 1770s, Richard Butler and his brother William were important traders at Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania and in Ohio. A street in Pittsburgh, Butler Street, is named for them.

==American Revolution==
At the outset of the American Revolution, the Continental Congress named Richard Butler a commissioner in 1775 to negotiate with the Indians. He visited representatives of the Delaware, Shawnee, and other tribes to secure their support, or at least neutrality, in the war with Britain.

On July 20, 1776, Butler was commissioned a major in the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment in the Continental Army, serving first as second in command to his friend Daniel Morgan. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on March 12, 1777, retroactive to September 1776. On June 7, 1777, he was promoted to colonel and placed in command of 9th Pennsylvania Regiment.

During the war he saw action at the Battle of Saratoga (1777) and the Battle of Monmouth (1778). His four other brothers also served, and were noted for their bravery as the &quot;fighting Butlers&quot;.

In January 1781 he was transferred to the 5th Pennsylvania and lead the Continental Army at the Battle of Spencer&#x27;s Ordinary.

At the conclusion of the Battle of Yorktown in October 1781, General George Washington conferred on Richard Butler the honor of receiving Cornwallis&#x27; sword of surrender, an honor which Richard gave to his second in command, Ebenezer Denny. At the last moment, Baron von Steuben demanded that he receive the sword. This almost precipitated a duel between Butler and Von Steuben.

At the victory dinner for his officers, George Washington raised his glass and toasted, &quot;The Butlers and their five sons!&quot;

Following Yorktown, Butler remained in the Continental Army and was transferred to the 3rd Pennsylvania following a consolidation of the Army on January 1, 1783. On September 30 of the same year, he was breveted (i.e. an honorary promotion) as a brigadier general. Butler remained in active service with the Continental Army until it was finally disbanded on November 3, 1783.

In 1783 Butler and his brothers became Original Members of the Pennsylvania Society of the Cincinnati, a military society of officers who had served in the Continental Army.

==Post American Revolution activity==
After the war, the Confederation Congress put Richard Butler in charge of Indians of the Northwest Territory. He negotiated the Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1784, in which the Iroquois surrendered their lands. He was also called upon during later negotiations, such as the Treaty of Fort McIntosh in 1785.

Butler returned to Pennsylvania, and was a judge in Allegheny County. He also served in the state legislature. He married Maria Smith and had four children, only one of whom lived to have children and continue the line. Butler also fathered a son, Captain Butler (or Tamanatha) with Shawnee chief Nonhelema. Butler and his Shawnee son fought in opposing armies in 1791.

In 1791, Butler was commissioned a major general in the levies (i.e. militiamen conscripted into Federal service) under Major General Arthur St. Clair to fight against the Western Confederacy of Native Americans in the Northwest Territories (modern day Ohio). He was killed in action on November 4, 1791, in St. Clair&#x27;s Defeat at what is now Fort Recovery, Ohio.

Reportedly he was first buried on the battlefield, which site was then lost until it was accidentally found years later. The remains were laid to rest with the remains of the other fallen at Fort Recovery.

==Legacy==
Butler County, Ohio, where Fort Hamilton stood, is named for Richard Butler, as are Butler County, Kentucky, and Butler County, Pennsylvania. The city of Butler, Pennsylvania, and the General Richard Butler Bridge (located in the city of Butler) are also named for him.

A miniature portrait of Richard Butler was painted by &quot;The Painter of The Revolution,&quot; Colonel John Trumbull, in 1790 and is in the collection of Yale University.

He is also honored in the name of General Richard Butler KYSAAR, Butler County, Kentucky recognized August 20, 2016. A chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution is named for him as well as on in the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), the General Richard Butler Chapter, founded in Butler, Pennsylvania.

<text>George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros of Helmsley (c. 147027 October 1513) was an English peer.

==Family==
George Manners, born about 1470, was the son of Sir Robert Manners (d. 1495) of Etal, Northumberland, and Eleanor de Ros or Roos (d. 1487), eldest daughter of Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros (9 September 1427 – 17 May 1464), and Philippa Tiptoft (c. 1423 – after 30 January 1487), daughter of John Tiptoft, 1st Baron Tiptoft and Powis. He had a brother and two sisters:

*Edward Manners.
*Elizabeth Manners, who married Sir William Fairfax (d. 11 May 1514) of Steeton, Yorkshire, Justice of the Common Pleas, son and heir of Sir Guy Fairfax of Steeton, Chief Justice of Lancaster, by Margaret, daughter of Sir William Ryther. A descendant of this marriage was the Parliamentary commander, Thomas Fairfax, who on 20 June 1637 married Anne Vere, daughter of Horace Vere, 1st Baron Vere of Tilbury, and Mary Tracy. Their daughter, Mary Fairfax, married George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, whose mother, Katherine, was the daughter of Francis Manners, 6th Earl of Rutland.
*Cecily Manners, who married Thomas Fairfax.

==Career==
Manners was enrolled at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn on 12 May 1490. In 1508, he was coheir to his uncle, Edmund de Ros, 10th Baron de Ros. In 1492, it had been determined that Edmund de Ros was unable to administer his own affairs, and he was placed in the custody of his brother-in-law, Sir Thomas Lovell, husband of Manners&#x27; aunt, Isabel Lovell. Edmund de Ros died on 23 October 1508, and was buried in the parish church at Elsing in Enfield, Middlesex. In about 1509, Manners was the sole heir to his aunt, Isabel Lovell.

Manners was with Thomas Howard, then Earl of Surrey, in the Scottish campaign of 1497, and was knighted by him on or before 30 September of that year. He was in attendance in 1500 when King Henry VII met Archduke Philip near Calais. In November 1501, he was among those who received Catherine of Aragon at St. George&#x27;s Field. He was nominated to the Order of the Garter on 27 April 1510, although not elected.

In 1513, Manners campaigned in France. He was a commander at the siege of Thérouanne, and was present at the siege of Tournai. He fell ill about the time Tournai surrendered on 23 September 1513.

Manners died on 27 October 1513, either in France or at Holywell in Shoreditch. He may have been first buried at Holywell, and his body later removed to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. His effigy is in the Rutland Chapel. His widow, Anne, died on 21 April 1526, and was buried at St. George&#x27;s, Windsor.

Manners owned a medieval manuscript copy of a chanson de geste, &quot;Les Voeux du Paon&quot; (The Vows of the Peacock), by Jacques de Longuyon, which is now Spencer Collection MS 009 in the New York Public Library. Manners wrote his name on a flyleaf of the manuscript, folio i verso, which may be viewed online.

==Marriage and issue==
Manners married, about 1490, Anne St Leger (c. 1475/6 – 21 April 1526), daughter and heiress of Thomas St. Leger by Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter, the second child and eldest surviving daughter of Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville (1415–1495), daughter of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland. Anne of York was the elder sister of King Edward IV; Edmund, Earl of Rutland; Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk; Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy; George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence and King Richard III.

George Manners and Anne St Leger had five sons and six daughters:

*Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, who married Eleanor Paston, credited with saying to Anne of Cleves, &#x27;Madam there must be more to it than that, or it will be long before we have a Duke of York which all this realm much desireth&#x27;. Their son, Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, married Margaret Neville, daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland by Katherine Stafford.
*Oliver Manners.
*Anthony Manners.
*Sir Richard Manners.
*John Manners.
*Anne Manners, who married Sir Henry Capell.
*Eleanor Manners, who married John Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Bath.
*Elizabeth Manners, who married Thomas Sandys, 2nd Baron Sandys.
*Katherine Manners, also known as Catherine Manners (c. 1510–c. 1547), who married Sir Robert Constable.
*Cecily Manners.
*Margaret Manners, who married firstly, Sir Henry Strangeways, and secondly, Robert Heneage.

==Monument==
His monument, consisting of a grand chest tomb with sculpted effigies of himself and his wife, survives in the Rutland Chantry (formerly the St Leger Chantry, founded by his father-in-law Sir Thomas St Leger) forming the north transept of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. The base of the monument and the stained glass windows display much heraldry of the Manners and St Leger families.

<doc id="1096151" wikidata="Q3258499" url="?curid=1096151" title="Parabolic fractal distribution">
<text>In probability and statistics, the parabolic fractal distribution is a type of discrete probability distribution in which the logarithm of the frequency or size of entities in a population is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank (with the largest example having rank 1). This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship (see references below).

In the Laherrère/Deheuvels paper below, examples include galaxy sizes (ordered by luminosity), towns (in the USA, France, and world), spoken languages (by number of speakers) in the world, and oil fields in the world (by size). They also mention utility for this distribution in fitting seismic events (no example). The authors assert the advantage of this distribution is that it can be fitted using the largest known examples of the population being modeled, which are often readily available and complete, then the fitted parameters found can be used to compute the size of the entire population. So, for example, the populations of the hundred largest cities on the planet can be sorted and fitted, and the parameters found used to extrapolate to the smallest villages, to estimate the population of the planet. Another example is estimating total world oil reserves using the largest fields.

In a number of applications, there is a so-called King effect where the top-ranked item(s) have a significantly greater frequency or size than the model predicts on the basis of the other items. The Laherrère/Deheuvels paper shows the example of Paris, when sorting the sizes of towns in France. When the paper was written Paris was the largest city with about ten million inhabitants, but the next largest town had only about 1.5 million. Towns in France excluding Paris closely follow a parabolic distribution, well enough that the 56 largest gave a very good estimate of the population of the country. But that distribution would predict the largest city to have about two million inhabitants, not 10 million. The King Effect is named after the notion that a King must defeat all rivals for the throne and takes their wealth, estates and power, thereby creating a buffer between himself and the next-richest of his subjects. That specific effect (intentionally created) may apply to corporate sizes, where the largest businesses use their wealth to buy up smaller rivals. Absent intent, the King Effect may occur as a result of some persistent growth advantage due to scale, or to some unique advantage. Larger cities are more efficient connectors of people, talent and other resources. Unique advantages might include being a port city, or a Capital city where law is made, or a center of activity where physical proximity increases opportunity and creates a feedback loop. An example is the motion picture industry; where actors, writers and other workers move to where the most studios are, and new studios are founded in the same place because that is where the most talent resides.

To test for the King Effect, the distribution must be fitted excluding the &#x27;k&#x27; top-ranked items, but without assigning new rank numbers to the remaining members of the 
population. For example, in France the ranks are (as of 2010):

# Paris, 12.09M
# Lyon, 2.12M
# Marseille, 1.72M
# Toulouse, 1.20M
# Lille, 1.15M

A fitting algorithm would process pairs {(1,12.09), (2,2.12), (3,1.72), (4,1.20), (5,1.15)} and find the parameters for the best parabolic fit through those points. To test for the King Effect we just exclude the first pair (or first &#x27;k&#x27; pairs), and find parabolic parameters that fit the remainder of the points. So for France we would
fit the four points {(2,2.12), (3,1.72), (4,1.20), (5,1.15)}. Then we can use those parameters to estimate the size of cities ranked [1,k] and determine if they are King Effect members or normal members.

By comparison, Zipf&#x27;s law fits a line through the points (also using the log of the rank and log of the value). A parabola (with one more parameter) will fit better, but far from the vertex the parabola is &quot;also&quot; nearly linear. Thus, although it is a judgment call for the statistician, if the fitted parameters put the vertex far from the points fitted, or if the parabolic curve is not a significantly better fit than a line, those may be symptomatic of overfitting (aka over-parameterization). The line (with two parameters instead of three) is probably the better generalization. More parameters always fit better, but at the cost of adding unexplained parameters or unwarranted assumptions (such as the assumption that a slight parabolic curve is a more appropriate model than a line).

Alternatively, it is possible to force the fitted parabola to have its vertex at the rank 1 position. In that case, it is not certain the parabola will fit better (have less error) than a straight line; and the choice might be made between the two based on which has the least error.

==Definition==
The probability mass function is given, as a function of the rank &quot;n&quot;, by

where &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; are parameters of the distribution.

<text>Beals is a lunar impact crater that is located near the eastern limb of the Moon, and lies across the southwestern rim of the crater Riemann. From the Earth the crater is viewed nearly from on edge, and is best seen during favorable librations. To the west is the large walled plain Gauss.

This crater formation is only lightly worn, with no significant impacts within its perimeter. The inner wall is narrower along the north-northeast face where the crater intrudes into Riemann, and the rim is somewhat irregular at the southern end. The interior floor is fractured, and has a few low ridges located near the midpoint.

Beals was formerly designated Riemann A, a satellite crater of Riemann, until the International Astronomical Union renamed it in 1982 to commemorate Carlyle S. Beals, a Canadian astronomer. Prior to the crater being designated Riemann A, this crater was known as &quot;Crater 110&quot;.

Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland, 12th Baron de Ros of Helmsley, KG (c. 1497{{snd}}20 September 1543), of Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire (adjacent to the small county of Rutland), was created Earl of Rutland by King Henry VIII in 1525.

==Origins==
Thomas was the son of Sir George Manners, 11th Baron de Ros (c. 1470{{snd}}1513) by his wife Anne St Leger (1476–1526). His maternal grandparents were Sir Thomas St Leger (c. 1440–1483) and Anne of York (1439–1476), a daughter of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville. She was thus an elder sister of Kings Edward IV (1461–1483) and of his brother and eventual successor, Richard III (1483–1485). Her other brothers were Edmund, Earl of Rutland and George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. Her sisters included Elizabeth of York, Duchess of Suffolk and Margaret of York. Anne St Leger&#x27;s first cousin, Elizabeth of York, married Henry Tudor and was the mother of Henry VIII and grandmother of Elizabeth I. Thomas Manners was thus a second cousin to Henry VIII.

==Career==
On 22 June 1513, Thomas landed at Calais on the French expedition. In 1513 he became Baron Ros, probably aged 16 or 17, on his father&#x27;s death and was summoned in 1515 to Parliament. He was at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520 and at King Henry VIII&#x27;s meeting with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor afterwards. In December 1521 he became cupbearer to the king. In January 1522 he was made steward of Pickering, Yorkshire, and from April to October of the same year he held the appointment of Lord Warden of the East Marches, in which he was succeeded by Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. He received the wardenship of Sherwood Forest on 12 July 1524, an office which afterwards became practically hereditary in his family. He was appointed a Knight of the Garter on 24 April 1525 and on 18 June 1525 he was made Earl of Rutland, a title previously held by members of the house of York.

He was a great favourite of King Henry VIII and received many grants, including the keepership of Enfield Chase on 12 July 1526, and Belvoir Castle, which remains the chief seat of his family. On 11 October 1532 he landed with the king in France. He was at the coronation of Queen Anne Boleyn in 1533 and later took part in her trial. Rutland was actively engaged in meeting the Pilgrimage of Grace. He held a joint command with the Earls of Huntingdon and Shrewsbury and marched to Nottingham and thence to Newark, Southwell, and Doncaster against the northern rebels.{{sfn|Archbold|1893}}

He was steward of many monasteries, and from his various ancestors had claims through their having founded certain of the houses. Hence at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, he received numerous grants of monastic property. In Leicestershire he obtained Charley, Garradon, and by exchange, Croxton; in Yorkshire he received Beverley, Warter, and Rievaulx by exchange. Jointly with Robert Tyrwhit, he obtained Belvoir, Eagle, and Kyme in Lincolnshire, and in Yorkshire Nun Burnham.

When Anne of Cleves came to England to marry the king, Rutland was appointed her lord chamberlain and met her at Shooter&#x27;s Hill on her approach to Greenwich Palace, after her unfortunate interview with the king at Rochester. In 1542 he became constable of Nottingham Castle. He went to the border again on 7 August 1542 as Warden of the Marches, but was recalled, in consequence of illness, in November of the same year. From Newark-on-Trent he wrote on 7 November to the Council of the North: &quot;As Gode best knows, I ame in a poyur and febvll estat&quot;. He died on 20 September 1543.{{sfn|Archbold|1893}}

==Knight of the Garter==

Manners, about two months before receipt of his earldom, was nominated by Henry VIII as a Knight of the Garter in 1525. His Garter stall plate of brass inlaid with coloured enamel, survives in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle. It is inscribed: {{lang|enm|Thom(a)s lord roosse, Erle of rotteland}}. Above the escutcheon, circumscribed by the Garter, is the crest of Manners: &quot;A peacock in pride&quot;. The arms displayed are: &quot;quarterly&quot;:&lt;br&gt;
1 and 4, or, two bars azure a chief quarterly of the last and gules, on the 1st and 4th, two fleurs-de-lis or, on the 2nd and 3rd, a lion passant guardant or (Manners, with augmentation for the 1st Earl);&lt;br&gt;
2, a grand quarter consisting of&lt;br&gt;
: 1, gules, three water bougets argent (Ros)
: 2, azure, a Catherine wheel or (Belvoir)
: 3, gules, three Catherine wheels argent (Espec)
: 4, argent, a fess between two bars gemels gules (Badlesmere)
3, a grand quarter consisting of&lt;br&gt;
: 1, gules, three lions pasant guardant or, within a bordure argent (Holland, Earls of Kent)
: 2 and 3, argent, a saltire engrailed gules (Tiptoft)
: 4, or, a lion rampant gules (Edward Charleton, 5th Baron Charleton of Powys (1370–1421))

==Marriages and children==
He married twice:
*Firstly in about 1512 to Elizabeth Lovell. The marriage ended in 1513. 
*Secondly in about 1523 he married Eleanor Paston, daughter of Sir William Paston of Norfolk. They had the following children:

===Sons===
*Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland (1526–1563)
*Sir John Manners (c. 1534–1611), of Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, husband of Dorothy Vernon, grandfather of John Manners, 8th Earl of Rutland and great-grandfather of John Manners, 1st Duke of Rutland and Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury.
*Sir Thomas Manners, grandfather of Thomas Vavasour, 1st Baronet.
*Roger Manners (died 1607) of Uffington, a squire of the body to Elizabeth I, died unmarried
*Oliver Manners, Esq.

===Daughters===
*Gertrude Manners, who married George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury and was the mother of Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury and Edward Talbot, 8th Earl of Shrewsbury.
*Anne Manners, who married Henry Neville, 5th Earl of Westmorland and was the mother of Charles Neville, 6th Earl of Westmorland.
*Frances Manners, who married Henry Nevill, 6th Baron Bergavenny and was grandmother of Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland.
*Katherine Manners, who married Sir Henry Capell, Sheriff of Essex.
*Elizabeth Manners (c. 1530{{snd}}8 August 1570), who married Sir John Savage of Rocksavage, whose mother was Elizabeth Somerset, daughter of Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester by his wife Elizabeth Herbert, 3rd Baroness Herbert. She was the grandmother of Thomas Savage, 1st Viscount Savage and the great-grandmother of John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers and was the great-great-grandmother of Charles Paulet, 1st Duke of Bolton.
*Isabel Manners, died young.

==Death and burial==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
He died on 20 September 1543 and was buried in Bottesford Church, Leicestershire. His body was embalmed with spices purchased in Nottingham and a surgeon encased it in wax. A plumber then encased it in a close-fitting leaden shell.

==Monument==

His surviving alabaster chest tomb in the chancel of St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bottesford, Leicestershire, was created by Richard Parker of Burton-on-Trent with John Lupton (rough mason) and his father, over a period of six days, the floor having been strengthened to the weight of the tomb. Thomas Richard Parker &quot;the alabaster man&quot; was paid £20 for the sculpture and the supervision of its positioning. Surviving accounts at Belvoir Castle record in considerable detail the arrangements for this work and the funeral. As well as commemorating the 1st Earl of Rutland and his wife this monument also marks the first of the future burials in the church of eight earls and four dukes over a period of almost 250 years.

===Description===
The Earl&#x27;s effigy is dressed in chain mail and full plate armour with a loose military tabard over which he wears the mantle of the Order of the Garter while on his left leg is the Garter itself. His head wears a basic form of coronet and rests on his tilt-heaume on top of which is the Manners crest of &quot;a peacock in pride&quot; on a Cap of Maintenance. The feet rest on a unicorn, from which the horn is now missing. The effigy of the countess is dressed in a gown and a short cape and wears an ermine-trimmed mantle fastened by a cordon whose ends reach almost to her feet, under which is a griffon. Tasselled cushions support her head. The base of the tomb is decorated with corner pilasters, tasselled swags and &quot;weeper&quot; figures representing knights, ladies and others.

<text>Calippus is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the eastern edge of the rugged Montes Caucasus mountain range in the northern part of the Moon. It was named after Greek astronomer Callippus of Cyzicus. It lies to the southwest of the crater remnant Alexander, to the northwest of the Mare Serenitatis.

The outer rim of Calippus has an irregular appearance, with outward bulges to the northeast and particularly to the west where there is an interior shelf of slumped material. The exterior has a slight that is surrounded by the rugged terrain of the mountain range. Within the sharp-sided interior walls is a rough and irregular interior floor.

To the southeast of this crater, on the edge of the Mare Serenitatis, is an arcing rille designated Rima Calippus. This cleft follows a path to the northeast for a length of about 40 kilometers.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Calippus.

<text>Fowler–Noll–Vo (or FNV) is a non-cryptographic hash function created by Glenn Fowler, Landon Curt Noll, and Kiem-Phong Vo.

The basis of the FNV hash algorithm was taken from an idea sent as reviewer comments to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2 committee by Glenn Fowler and Phong Vo in 1991. In a subsequent ballot round, Landon Curt Noll improved on their algorithm. In an email message to Noll, they named it the &quot;Fowler/Noll/Vo&quot; or FNV hash.

==Overview==
The current versions are FNV-1 and FNV-1a, which supply a means of creating non-zero &quot;FNV offset basis&quot;. FNV currently comes in 32-, 64-, 128-, 256-, 512-, and 1024-bit variants. For pure FNV implementations, this is determined solely by the availability of &quot;FNV primes&quot; for the desired bit length; however, the FNV webpage discusses methods of adapting one of the above versions to a smaller length that may or may not be a power of two.

The FNV hash algorithms and reference FNV source code have been released into the public domain.

The Python programming language previously used a modified version of the FNV scheme for its default codice_1 function. From Python 3.4, FNV has been replaced with SipHash to resist &quot;hash flooding&quot; denial-of-service attacks.

FNV is not a cryptographic hash.

==The hash==

One of FNV&#x27;s key advantages is that it is very simple to implement. Start with an initial hash value of &quot;FNV offset basis&quot;. For each byte in the input, multiply &quot;hash&quot; by the &quot;FNV prime&quot;, then XOR it with the byte from the input. The alternate algorithm, FNV-1a, reverses the multiply and XOR steps.

===FNV-1 hash===

The FNV-1 hash algorithm is as follows:

 algorithm fnv-1 is
 &quot;hash&quot; := FNV_offset_basis
 for each &quot;byte_of_data&quot; to be hashed do
 &quot;hash&quot; := &quot;hash&quot; × FNV_prime
 &quot;hash&quot; := &quot;hash&quot; XOR &quot;byte_of_data&quot;
 return &quot;hash&quot; 

In the above pseudocode, all variables are unsigned integers. All variables, except for &quot;byte_of_data&quot;, have the same number of bits as the FNV hash. The variable, &quot;byte_of_data&quot;, is an 8-bit unsigned integer.

As an example, consider the 64-bit FNV-1 hash:

* All variables, except for &quot;byte_of_data&quot;, are 64-bit unsigned integers.
* The variable, &quot;byte_of_data&quot;, is an 8-bit unsigned integer.
* The &quot;FNV_offset_basis&quot; is the 64-bit value: 14695981039346656037 (in hex, 0xcbf29ce484222325).
* The &quot;FNV_prime&quot; is the 64-bit value 1099511628211 (in hex, 0x100000001b3).
* The multiply returns the lower 64 bits of the product.
* The XOR is an 8-bit operation that modifies only the lower 8-bits of the hash value.
* The &quot;hash&quot; value returned is a 64-bit unsigned integer.

===FNV-1a hash===

The FNV-1a hash differs from the FNV-1 hash only by the order in which the multiply and XOR is performed:

 algorithm fnv-1a is
 &quot;hash&quot; := FNV_offset_basis
 for each &quot;byte_of_data&quot; to be hashed do
 &quot;hash&quot; := &quot;hash&quot; XOR &quot;byte_of_data&quot;
 &quot;hash&quot; := &quot;hash&quot; × FNV_prime
 return &quot;hash&quot; 
The above pseudocode has the same assumptions that were noted for the FNV-1 pseudocode. The change in order leads to slightly better avalanche characteristics.

===FNV-0 hash (deprecated)===
The FNV-0 hash differs from the FNV-1 hash only by the initialisation value of the &quot;hash&quot; variable:

 algorithm fnv-0 is
 &quot;hash&quot; := 0
 for each &quot;byte_of_data&quot; to be hashed do
 &quot;hash&quot; := &quot;hash&quot; × FNV_prime
 &quot;hash&quot; := &quot;hash&quot; XOR &quot;byte_of_data&quot;
 return &quot;hash&quot;

The above pseudocode has the same assumptions that were noted for the FNV-1 pseudocode.

A consequence of the initialisation of the hash to 0 is that empty messages and all messages consisting of only the byte 0, regardless of their length, hash to 0.

Use of the FNV-0 hash is deprecated except for the computing of the FNV offset basis for use as the FNV-1 and FNV-1a hash parameters.

===FNV offset basis===

There are several different FNV offset bases for various bit lengths. These offset bases are computed by computing the FNV-0 from the following 32 octets when expressed in ASCII:
This is one of Landon Curt Noll&#x27;s signature lines. This is the only current practical use for the deprecated FNV-0.

===FNV prime===

An &quot;FNV prime&quot; is a prime number and is determined as follows:

For a given integer such that , let and ; then the -bit FNV prime is the smallest prime number that is of the form
:formula_1

such that:
:* the number of one-bits in the binary representation of is either 4 or 5, and

Experimentally, FNV primes matching the above constraints tend to have better dispersion properties. They improve the polynomial feedback characteristic when an FNV prime multiplies an intermediate hash value. As such, the hash values produced are more scattered throughout the -bit hash space.

===FNV hash parameters===

The above FNV prime constraints and the definition of the FNV offset basis yield the following table of FNV hash parameters:

==Non-cryptographic hash==

The FNV hash was designed for fast hash table and checksum use, not cryptography. The authors have identified the following properties as making the algorithm unsuitable as a cryptographic hash function:

* Speed of computation – As a hash designed primarily for hashtable and checksum use, FNV-1 and FNV-1a were designed to be fast to compute. However, this same speed makes finding specific hash values (collisions) by brute force faster.
* Sticky state – Being an iterative hash based primarily on multiplication and XOR, the algorithm is sensitive to the number zero. Specifically, if the hash value were to become zero at any point during calculation, and the next byte hashed were also all zeroes, then the hash would not change. This makes colliding messages trivial to create given a message that results in a hash value of zero at some point in its calculation. Additional operations, such as the addition of a third constant prime on each step, can mitigate this but may have detrimental effects on avalanche effect or random distribution of hash values.
* Diffusion – The ideal secure hash function is one in which each byte of input has an equally-complex effect on every bit of the hash. In the FNV hash, the ones place (the rightmost bit) is always the XOR of the rightmost bit of every input byte. This can be mitigated by XOR-folding (computing a hash twice the desired length, and then XORing the bits in the &quot;upper half&quot; with the bits in the &quot;lower half&quot;).

<text>Crommelin is an ancient lunar impact crater that is located in the vicinity of the south pole of the Moon, on the far side. It lies to the north of the large crater Zeeman, and to the east-northeast of Numerov.

This formation has been almost completely worn away by subsequent impacts, leaving little more than a crater-riddled depression in the surface. There is an equally worn crater lying across the northern rim, and Crommelin X is attached to the outward-bulging northwest perimeter. The largest of the craterlets within the interior form a pair near the southern rim. There is a slight central peak, consisting of little more than a low rise in the surface.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on Lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Crommelin.

<doc id="1096178" wikidata="Q515168" url="?curid=1096178" title="Battle off Horaniu">
<text>The Battle off Horaniu (Japanese: 第一次ベララベラ海戦) was a minor naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II, fought near Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. On the night of 17–18 August 1943, four U.S. Navy destroyers intercepted an Imperial Japanese Navy convoy carrying troops to Horaniu, on the northern coast of Vella Lavella, where they were to establish a barge base to support the movement of troops through the region.

The Japanese convoy was escorted by four destroyers, and both sides exchanged torpedoes and gunfire from long range. After two Japanese destroyers were slightly damaged, the escort withdrew, allowing the U.S. force to sink five small ships from the convoy. However, the majority of the troop carrying barges escaped by hiding along the Vella Lavella coast and subsequently completed their mission on 19 August. In October, the Japanese used the base to support the mass withdrawal of troops from Kolombangara.

==Background==

In mid-1943, in the wake of the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies launched their next offensive in the Solomon Islands, focused upon seizing the major Japanese airstrip at Munda on New Georgia. After the fall of Munda on 4–5 August and defeat in the Battle of Vella Gulf on 6–7 August, the Japanese decided to evacuate their garrisons in the central Solomons, firstly moving to Baanga Island while planning to bring forces south from Rabaul for a potential counterattack.

On 15 August, the Allies landed on Vella Lavella, bypassing the main Japanese troop concentration on Kolombangara. To maintain contact with these troops, and ensure their later withdrawal, the Japanese planned to establish a staging base at Horaniu, on the northern tip of Vella Lavella.

Commanded by Captain Matsuji Ijuin, the destroyers , , , and left Rabaul on 17 August to rendezvous with a troop convoy from Buin, on Bougainville. This convoy included 13 barges, four motor torpedo boats, the subchasers &quot;Cha-12&quot; and &quot;Cha-5&quot;, and a &quot;Soukoutei-class&quot; armored boat. The troops embarked consisted of two Imperial Japanese Army companies and an Imperial Japanese Navy platoon.

==Battle==

After the Japanese force was located by Allied reconnaissance aircraft, Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson, commander of the Third Amphibious Force, dispatched a division of four destroyers from Purvis Bay on Florida Island to intercept them. This force consisted of , , , and , under Captain Thomas J. Ryan. They departed their anchorage at 15:27 on 17 August and began a fast run up the New Georgia Sound, also known as &quot;The Slot&quot;. When Ryan&#x27;s destroyers were off the north coast of Kolombangara, lookouts on watch saw a burst of anti-aircraft fire in the distance, giving away the position of the Japanese convoy.

Despite a full moon, visibility was limited to due to low-lying clouds and intermittent rain showers. However, at about 23:30, the Japanese convoy was attacked by eight AirSols Avenger torpedo bombers and forced to scatter, although no ships were damaged. Two of the escorts, &quot;Isokaze&quot; and &quot;Shigure&quot;, sailing abreast, began herding the smaller craft back into formation, while &quot;Sazanami&quot; and &quot;Hamakaze&quot; continued on a northwesterly course. Ryan was advised by the Avengers the Japanese ships were still heading for Vella Lavella, although his destroyers were detected shortly afterwards by a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, which began circling in preparation for an attack. The convoy was still reforming when at 00:29 on 18 August Ryan&#x27;s radar detected the Japanese destroyers to the northwest at a range of , then the Japanese barges; at 00:32, Japanese lookouts spotted the U.S. destroyers, which had closed to .

The Japanese convoy was still short of its destination, and Ijuin was under orders to avoid decisive engagement. He dispatched two of his destroyers to turn to the north in an effort to lure the U.S. force away from the troop-carrying vessels. To conceal his position, Ryan decided not to use his deck guns and began maneuvering for a torpedo attack on the Japanese destroyers, rather than attacking the barges. This surprised Ijuin who had expected the opposite. Around 00:40, the Japanese aircraft dropped several flares over the U.S. ships, giving away their location, and Ryan turned back to engage the convoy to his east. Ijuin ordered his ships to begin firing torpedoes six minutes later, loosing 31 between 00:50 and 00:54 at a range of . By making a series of turns to avoid the Japanese barges, the American destroyers unintentionally avoided all 31 torpedoes, and around 00:56, the Japanese gunners opened fire. However, to avoid revealing their position their searchlights were turned off, and no damage was inflicted on Ryan&#x27;s destroyers.

After a series of turns, the U.S. destroyers opened fire with radar controlled 5-inch guns at 00:58, which damaged &quot;Hamakaze&quot;, while &quot;Chevalier&quot; loosed a salvo of four torpedoes towards &quot;Shigure&quot; from a distance of . This attack was unsuccessful. The Japanese ships laid down a smokescreen and began to zigzag to throw off the U.S. gunners&#x27; aim. Torpedo attacks by both &quot;Shigure&quot; and &quot;Isokaze&quot; were also unsuccessful and were followed by an inaccurate radar report that another U.S. naval force was advancing from the south. Ijuin could not afford to lose any of his destroyers, and after an ineffective long-range exchange of torpedoes and gunfire he ordered them to withdraw at about 01:00. Ryan&#x27;s ships kept firing until the Japanese were out of range, then pursued them, moving onto a parallel course while undertaking evasive maneuvers until 01:11 to avoid any torpedoes that might have been fired. At this time, &quot;Isokaze&quot; fired a torpedo salvo from , which failed to score a hit but in return was damaged by an American 5-inch shell, wounding several sailors.

Due to a mechanical fault on &quot;Chevalier&quot;, the Americans were unable to catch the fast-moving Japanese destroyers, who were withdrawing at . Ryan turned back to locate the troop convoy, but the small craft had taken advantage of the destroyer contest to disperse; although the Americans managed to sink five, the majority subsequently escaped. Harassed by the Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, Ryan&#x27;s destroyers returned to Tulagi.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the battle, a total of five Japanese auxiliary ships were sunk. This included two subchasers, two motor torpedo boats, and one powered barge with an unknown number of personnel killed or injured. Two destroyers, &quot;Hamakaze&quot; and &quot;Isokaze&quot;, were slightly damaged, although this was not significant and both took part in further actions three days later. Despite these losses, the Japanese saved the majority of their barges which spent 18 August quietly lying in hiding along the northern coast of Vella Lavella and were subsequently able to land 390 troops on 19 August. These personnel established a barge base at Horaniu, while Ijuin&#x27;s force returned to Rabaul believing that they had sunk one U.S. destroyer.

The Japanese withdrawal in the central Solomons continued throughout August and September. After Baanga Island was evacuated on 22 August, the Japanese garrison withdrew to Arundel Island, and over the course of a month they fought a series of delaying actions there until late September. Meanwhile, on Vella Lavella, Horaniu fell to Allied forces on 14 September, while the base&#x27;s 600 personnel were pushed into a small perimeter on the northwestern part of the island. They were withdrawn on the night of 6–7 October, along with almost 10,000 troops that were evacuated from Kolombangara to Choisel and Bougainville.

<doc id="1096181" wikidata="Q669213" url="?curid=1096181" title="Nissan Prairie">
<text>The is an automobile manufactured and marketed by Nissan from 1981 to 2004. Considered a mini MPV or a compact MPV. It was also marketed as the Multi in Canada and the Stanza Wagon in the United States. In Japan, it was exclusive to &quot;Nissan Bluebird Store&quot; locations, then later at &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; sales channels. The Prairie had a very flexible seating capability and sliding rear doors on both sides of the vehicle, with a liftgate in the back. The name &quot;&quot; was derived from French which means an extensive area of relatively flat grassland, similar to &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;.

The second generation was marketed as the Nissan Axxess in North America, and replaced there by the larger Nissan/Ford joint venture called the Nissan Quest, and in Europe it was partially replaced by the Nissan Serena.

When the third generation of this vehicle was introduced in Japan, it was renamed initially Prairie Liberty, with the &quot;Prairie&quot; name eventually dropped in November 1998. This vehicle was replaced with the Nissan Lafesta in 2004.

==First generation (M10; 1982)==
The Nissan Prairie, known in Canada as the Multi and the United States as the Stanza Wagon, was equipped with a four-cylinder engine, with either a manual or automatic transmission. Available with front wheel drive or optional four wheel drive, the vehicle had rear passenger sliding doors on both sides of the vehicle, and a folding rear seat, designed to increase the carrying capacity of the passenger compartment. The rear tailgate opened upwards as one complete unit, in a similar fashion to a hatchback or station wagon. The Prairie competed with the Toyota Sprinter Carib with a similar wagon approach, Mitsubishi Chariot, and the Honda Shuttle.
The Prairie resembled a tall station wagon / estate with the addition of sliding side doors. It was available with five seats, though seven and eight were also available in some markets. It was developed from the Nissan Sunny platform, while using the powertrain from the Nissan Stanza. It was a companion model to the more traditional cabover Nissan Vanette, offering buyers a choice of appearance and flexibility. The trailing arm torsion beam rear suspension was borrowed from the Pulsar Van (VN10; sold as the Cherry Wagon in Europe). Some reviewers commented that when driven hard, undesirable body characteristics were exhibited, possibly due to the combination of missing B-pillar and torsion beam rear suspension. Strong understeering characteristics were also typical.

The Prairie design was strongly inspired by the Lancia Megagamma concept by Giorgetto Giugiaro and ItalDesign, shown in 1979, and offered Japanese buyers a spacious, flexible passenger/cargo arrangement that complied with Japanese Government dimension regulations and used small displacement engines that offered Japanese buyers options with regards to annual road tax obligations.

The first generation Prairies were innovative vehicles - featuring no B-pillar between the front and rear doors (instead the interlocking front and sliding rear doors locked onto both the floor and roof of the vehicle); front seatbelts mounted on the doors (excluding the US versions) that facilitated a totally unimpeded side entrance; front seats that could be slid all the way to the front of the passenger compartment and fully reclined; rear seats that could not only be folded away conventionally, but could also be reclined fully to make a double bed (in combination with the front seats); rear window winders that folded into themselves (to prevent catching when the doors were slid open); tailgate that opened past the floor of the very low and flat luggage compartment (the center section of the rear bumper was mounted on the tailgate); optional front-facing third row of seats. This type of entry was later introduced on the Toyota Isis, but only on the passenger side.

It was originally launched in Japan with a 1.5- or 1.8-litre Inline-four engine mated to a five-speed gearbox. Another notable addition to the Japanese market&#x27;s models was an optional column shifted manual. A four-wheel drive version followed later in the car&#x27;s life. An extensive accessories and options list was available in the Japanese Domestic Market, including a kit that effectively turned the vehicle into a campervan. In January 1985 a facelifted version was introduced, with slightly modified engines. These later cars received a new grille treatment and an entirely redesigned rear end: the bumper was now mounted separately to provide more stability after earlier versions had come under criticism for being much too flexible. This redesign also included taller, flush-fit rear side windows. In September 1985 the 4WD model finally appeared, using a larger 2-litre engine and the rear axle from the Nissan Sunny 4WD (B12). A 4WD model had been planned from the beginning, but the original bodyshell&#x27;s lack of rigidity made Nissan rethink the concept.

The vehicle was launched as the Datsun Prairie in Europe and was rebranded to Nissan along with the rest of the range from 1984, at first featuring &quot;Datsun by Nissan&quot; badging and then solely &quot;Nissan&quot; badging from 1985. However, as Prairie was a slow but steady seller, some instrument clusters remained with the Datsun script featuring on the centre of the speedometer. Nissan tried, with partial success, to cover over the script a grey sticker over the plastic fascia of the instruments, rather than on the speedometer itself. The 1.5-litre engine was dropped from the UK market sometime after the 1986 facelift with the 1.8 becoming the sole engine offered. From the facelift (larger front lights, larger front indicators with additional side repeat indicators, trim improvements, redesigned rear tail light clusters) onwards the UK model was available either in 1.5 GL, 1.8 SGL or 1.8 SGL Anniversary II specification (featuring two-tone paint, electric front windows, electric steel sliding sunroof, power assisted steering and a dealer applied &#x27;Anniversary II&#x27; badge on the tailgate). The Prairie was sold with a 3-year 100,000 mile warranty and a 6-year anti-corrosion warranty.

The European 1.5 produces , while the later 2.0 offered . Four-wheel-drive was introduced along with the larger engine.

==Second generation (M11; 1988)==

The second generation of the Prairie was introduced September 1988 and marketed as the Axxess in North America. To meet concerns that the original bodyshell was too weak, the platform used was upgraded from the smaller Nissan Sunny to the larger Nissan Bluebird. The engines were correspondingly bigger as well. The second generation Prairie lost some of the innovative features that made the first generation standout - the B-pillar was reinstated, the torsion beam rear suspension was replaced with a more conventional coil setup which prevented the rear seats from reclining. The vehicle sold for six years (1990–95) in Canada, but only for the 1990 model year in the United States, as it was replaced by the Nissan Quest. The U.S. version had motorized automatic seatbelts while the Canadian versions had manual belts.

North American models only offered the larger 2.4-litre engine. Elsewhere the Prairie came with optional AWD and a 2.0-litre engine. In Europe, the Prairie was later replaced with the taller, more van-like Nissan Serena, while the Nissan Quest replaced both the Axxess and the Nissan Van in North America.

===Nissan Prairie Joy===
In Japan, Nissan stretched the rear of the vehicle to better accommodate third seat passengers and load carrying, calling the vehicle the Prairie Joy and offering the vehicle in August 1995. Conversions offered a raised roof over the passenger space up to the rear hatch. As of May 1997, anti-lock brakes and driver and front passenger airbags were offered, along with ultraviolet restricting tinted glass.

==Third generation (M12; 1998)==
For this generation, the car&#x27;s name was changed to Nissan Liberty in Japan, while in Hong Kong, it retained the Prairie name. It has rear sliding doors and was available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. It is equipped with either the SR20DE or the SR20DET engine, both of which are mated to either a 4-speed automatic or a CVT transmission.

The third generation Prairie now shared a platform with the compact station wagon Nissan Avenir with the Prairie/Liberty focused more on flexible seating and cargo carrying duties.

Some of the issues buyers had with the Prairie was its appearance and performance, so the styling was given more attention, and Nissan&#x27;s Autech division punched up its performance image, by offering the Liberty Rider that replaced the Axis trim package. The turbocharged engine was offered in the &quot;Highway Star 4WD&quot; package October 12, 1999, as well as the &quot;Highway Star GT4&quot;, also enhanced by Autech. Front wheel drive vehicles were only available with the CVT transmission. Styling and luxury items offered on the larger Nissan Elgrand were also offered on the Liberty.

The Liberty saw competition from Toyota and Honda during this generation from the Toyota Ipsum, Mitsubishi Chariot, and the Honda Stream, and was joined with the new, larger Nissan Presage at &quot;Nissan Bluebird Store&quot; locations.

From June 19, 2001, Nissan offered a rear door that swung up electrically, with a platform that extended out for passengers that used a wheelchair, and by remote control. The sliding doors were offered with an electrically opening feature on both sides from May 7, 2001. A facelift appeared in September 2002 and various appearance packages were offered to update the appearance until sales ended in December 2004, and replaced by the all new Nissan Lafesta.

<doc id="1096182" wikidata="Q3569937" url="?curid=1096182" title="Workopolis">
<text>Workopolis was a Canadian website specializing in online job searching. Headquartered in Toronto, Workopolis had offices in eight Canadian cities including Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary and Vancouver and provided its services in both English and French. It was acquired by Indeed.com in June 2018 and subsequently shut down as an independent job board. It remains as a white label portal for Indeed&#x27;s Canadian job postings.

==History==
Formed initially by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; to host career postings, Workopolis gained its current name after Torstar partnered with the Globe and Mail in 2000. In 2002, Gesca became the third partner of the site. In October 2006 both Torstar and Gesca acquired the 40% stake of the company from the Globe and Mail, parting 50% stake of the site.

Workopolis was the supplier of Online Recruitment Services for the Vancouver 2010 Olympics and Paralympic Winter Games.

In 2013, Workopolis was described by CTV News as one of Canada&#x27;s top jobs website.

Recruit Holdings, owners of Indeed purchased Workopolis in April 2018.

<doc id="1096184" wikidata="Q1959559" url="?curid=1096184" title="The Starting Line">
<text>The Starting Line is an American pop-punk band formed in Churchville, Pennsylvania in 1999. They are currently based in Philadelphia.

==History==

===Early years (1999–2001)===
In 1999, the band that would become The Starting Line was initiated when guitarist Matt Watts, from his Connecticut dorm room, sent out emails to people from the AOL member directory who had similar bands in their profiles. He sent out many emails including one vocalist/bassist Kenny Vasoli. It asked if the 14-year-old Vasoli, who was at that time in a band called Smash Adams, was interested in &quot;Jamming and shit&quot;, as the message title read. Kenny was the only person to respond to Matt&#x27;s emails. Only a few weeks later, Vasoli found himself rehearsing with his future band-mates Watts, guitarist Mike Golla and drummer Tom Gryskewicz. According to Matt Watts, the guys &quot;jammed and wrote a couple of songs&quot;.

From there, the band started to book shows. One of the shows was with the band Saves the Day. Saves the Day was putting out a record-release show for their second album Through Being Cool in Harrisburg, PA. Soon, the band started touring under the name Sunday Drive, selling out home-made merchandise and a self-recorded demo cassette titled &quot;Four Songs&quot;. Their first official release was a three-way split with The Jimmy Tuesday Band and The Commercials contributing three songs each, released on KickStart Audio in 2000. The three songs on the split from the band were &#x27;West Girl Scout Road&#x27;, &#x27;Forever in a Day&#x27; and &#x27;Nothing Short of a Miracle&#x27;.

Sunday Drive was soon approached by We the People Records and asked to produce a recording session (the &quot;We the People Records Sessions&quot;). Set for a release in December 2000, the twelve songs were initially planned to become the band&#x27;s debut full-length on We the People Records, but they ended up serving only as demos for tracks on future releases, as the band signed with Drive-Thru Records in April 2001. They later found out that the name Sunday Drive was already taken by a Christian rock band, so they changed their band name to the Starting Line. The band has said there is no significance behind the name, it was the only name they all could agree upon.

===&quot;With Hopes of Starting Over EP&quot; (2001)===
On Drive-Thru, they soon released their debut EP &quot;With Hopes of Starting Over...&quot; on July 17, 2001. The album contained an earlier version of the song &#x27;Leaving&#x27;, which was a fan-favorite from the We The People sessions, and would eventually become the band&#x27;s second single on their debut full-length album Say It Like You Mean It.

===&quot;Say It Like You Mean It&quot; (2002)===
On July 16, 2002, almost exactly one year after the release of their EP, the full-length &quot;Say It Like You Mean It&quot; followed. The songs ranged from energetic and fast-paced to melancholy and calm, dealing with performing on stage (&quot;Given the Chance&quot;- &quot;I can&#x27;t wait to hit the stage/and say hello/To Jersey&quot;), vacation (&quot;Left Coast Envy&quot;- &quot;Vacation&#x27;s everything we need/Can I sell this sunrise/In return for a sunset?&quot;) and getting even with Vasoli&#x27;s ex-girlfriend (&quot;Up &amp; Go&quot;, &quot;Hello Houston&quot;, &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot;, among others). The single &quot;The Best of Me&quot; and its two music videos, as well as the second single &quot;Leaving&quot;, received heavy radio and TV airplay, securing the Starting Line a spot on the Warped Tour. A clip of &quot;Up &amp; Go&quot; was played during an episode of the short-lived television series from Fox, John Doe. The episode aired December 13, 2002, and was entitled &#x27;The Mourner.&#x27; &quot;Up &amp; Go&quot; was also included in the full-length trailer for the movie &quot;She&#x27;s The Man&quot;, which starred Amanda Bynes. In 2003 the band appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, performing the song &quot;The Best of Me&quot;.

===&quot;The Make Yourself at Home EP&quot; (2003)===
Due to their desire to put out new material, the band decided to release an all-unplugged EP, recorded in three sessions over the following year. The first three songs (&quot;Make Yourself at Home&quot;, &quot;Selective&quot;, and &quot;Playing Favorites&quot;) (recorded in The Prize Fight&#x27;s Bob Jones&#x27; bedroom in August 2002), the second session (&quot;The Nightlife&quot; and acoustic version of &quot;Best of Me&quot;) (recorded in Vasoli&#x27;s basement in March 2003) and the last track (&quot;Lasting Impressions&quot;) (recorded on the band&#x27;s touring bus in April 2003) became &quot;The Make Yourself at Home EP&quot;, released on November 25, 2003. The CD and the DVD version issued simultaneously, featuring an acoustic set performed live at Skate &amp; Surf 2003 in Asbury Park, New Jersey, would be their last releases put out solely on Drive-Thru Records, as The Starting Line was signed by Geffen Records soon afterwards.

===&quot;Based on a True Story&quot; (2005)===
Their major label debut, &quot;Based on a True Story&quot;, came out in May 2005. Lyrically, the band dissociated themselves from the post-relationship formula that was predominant on their previous records. The album is punctuated by several more aggressive songs, written to spite the band&#x27;s record label. &quot;Inspired by the $&quot; featured lyrics that are directed at Geffen: &quot;Someone/Get to the point/Get it across!/To the boys at the top of the ladder I&#x27;m climbing up/I have my doubts&quot;. Another section of the song refers to a meeting the band had with the label&#x27;s executives, where the Starting Line was asked to write more radio-friendly songs in the vein of New Found Glory&#x27;s &quot;Catalyst&quot; (2004) and recreate &quot;Best of Me&quot; (&quot;&quot;Just stay the same way/Do it like you did it before/Remain the same shape&quot;.&quot; The album was far more successful than the band&#x27;s 2002 effort and sold 42,000 copies within its first week, as opposed to its predecessor&#x27;s 11,000. The release was followed by the semi-headlining Nintendo Fusion Tour with Fall Out Boy, kicking off in September 2005. The band brought with them a new addition to their live performances, keyboardist Brian Schmutz. A friend of Vasoli&#x27;s, the two had short lived side-project called Statue in 2004. A few dates into the tour, the Starting Line were, at their request, released from their record deal with Geffen. Vasoli describes their time with Geffen: &quot; It was kind of like having a sort of hot girlfriend that never talks to you. You say, &quot;Oh yeah, I &#x27;m dating this supermodel, but she&#x27;s been in France for three years and doesn&#x27;t really call me... but she promises that when she gets back we&#x27;re REALLY gonna start to get serious. It was always an imaginary relationship.&quot; In 2005 their song &quot;The World&quot; appeared on the video game Burnout Revenge and again on the television series American Idol in 2011.

===&quot;Direction&quot; (2007)===
In early January 2006, the band signed with Virgin Records. The band released their third full-length album &quot;Direction&quot; on July 31, 2007, containing the single &quot;Island&quot; which was written about Vasoli&#x27;s girlfriend of the last four years, Michelle. The album had songs like &quot;What You Want&quot;, &quot;21&quot;, &quot;Birds&quot; and &quot;Direction&quot;. &quot;Island&quot; was the group&#x27;s lone charting single, peaking at No. 21 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts. The album peaked at No. 30 on the Billboard 200 chart, but fell off the chart four weeks later. The band completed the 2007 Warped Tour and began their nationwide tour with Paramore in October.

===Hiatus and reunion (2008-2011)===
In March 2008 the band announced in an e-mail and on Absolutepunk.net they would be going on a break in order for Ken and Brian to explore Person L, Matt and Tom to experiment with the group The Seventy Six, and Mike to spend time with his two daughters and also play with The Traded Series. Matt Watts became a band manager for Red Light Management, managing the bands Fake Problems, Like Lions, New Atlantic, and Hit The Lights. He has since worked in executive positions for Hard Rock Cafe, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation and Vans. The band stated, &quot;They will continue The Starting Line if and when the time is right.&quot;

In April 2009, Kenny Vasoli hinted that the Starting Line may actually be returning sooner than 2011, saying &quot;it&#x27;s looking good, may even be earlier. I hung with Matt and Tom the other day, we all are still in love with one another.&quot; On November 10, 2009, The Starting Line released their first Live CD/DVD entitled &quot;&quot;Somebody&#x27;s Gonna Miss Us&quot;.&quot; The Live CD/DVD documents the band&#x27;s formation and growth through their last tour and final show at Bamboozle 2008. In December 2009, the Starting Line had a reunion concert at the Theater of Living Arts. The Starting Line guitarist Matt Watts stated on the website AbsolutePunk, that &quot;this doesn&#x27;t mean that TSL are back together...It simply means that we&#x27;re taking a break from our break, and wanted to play a fun show in Philadelphia and continue to focus on our lives outside of TSL&quot; (Kohl 1). The Starting Line added a second holiday show in Philadelphia at the Trocadero Theater due to the fact that the first holiday show scheduled for sold out in a little over an hour and the band would like to give their local fans a better chance to see them. Towards the end of their set, Kenny Vasoli announced the band&#x27;s reunion.

The band played the Australian Soundwave Festival in February 2011. Matt Watts explained that they &quot;didn&#x27;t want to pass up this opportunity to hang out, have fun, and play with some really great bands,&quot; but again stated, &quot;this doesn&#x27;t mean that TSL are back together, and that we don&#x27;t plan on doing a US tour any time in the near future.&quot; In May 2011, at Slam Dunk Records Leeds music festival, the band played a 50-minute set during which Kenny Vasoli announced &quot;People keep asking us when we&#x27;re getting back together, and the answer I have is yesterday. And what happens when bands get together? They write music. So, we have a new song for you.&quot; The song is entitled &#x27;Luck&#x27;.

In late June 2012, the band posted a countdown timer on their website. Upon completion, the website was updated with information about a tour celebrating the 10-year anniversary of their debut album &quot;Say It Like You Mean It&quot;. The tour would include the band playing the entire album from start to finish. In 2012, frontman Kenny Vasoli formed a side band, Vacationer, which released their debut album, &quot;Gone&quot;, in June of that same year.

The Starting Line reunited once again for a Christmas show in 2013 at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. On July 11, 2014, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official website that they would be playing another holiday show on December 26, 2014, at the Trocadero in Philadelphia. According to an article on propertyofzack.com, Kenny Vasoli confirmed on stage that the band would be releasing new material in 2015. Said article also features a very low quality video of a new song. On December 14, 2015, the band announced a new EP titled Anyways (EP). The title track was released as the lead single on December 18, 2015. Anyways (EP) marked the band&#x27;s first studio release in 9 years. After years of touring with the band, Schmutz was also confirmed as a full-time member.

===&quot;Anyways EP&quot; (2015)===
On December 14, 2015, the band announced a new EP titled &quot;Anyways&quot;. The title track was released as the lead single on December 18, 2015. &quot;Anyways&quot; marked the band&#x27;s first studio release in 9 years. The title track appeared in a 2016 episode, series 7, episode 21 of the television series The Vampire Diaries.

===New music and beyond (2023)===
During the first of their two 2023 holiday shows on December 7, 2023, in Philadelphia, the band played a new song called &quot;Blame&quot;. It was the first new song the band released since the Anyways (EP) in 2015. Kenny announced before playing the song that it would be released &quot;TBA&quot;, along with more music to come. The band played &quot;Blame&quot; again the following night, on their way to selling out back-to-back shows at the venue Underground Arts in their hometown.

The band was referenced in Taylor Swift&#x27;s song &quot;The Black Dog&quot; from her 2024 album &quot;The Tortured Poets Department&quot;. Their reference in the song prompted Instagram and Facebook posts thanking Taylor for the &quot;name check&quot;. In the posts, the band referenced #4OTW, indicating their fourth album is in the works.

During their holiday shows in December 2024, the band introduced another new song named &quot;Granted&quot;. Kenny said that the band has been making new music.

<text>EUjet was a low-cost airline based at Shannon Airport, Ireland. It operated a network of services from its main base at Shannon Airport (SNN), with a hub at Kent International Airport (MSE), Manston, Kent, UK. The airline was sold to a British company, PlaneStation, which also owned Kent airport, for €10m. In July 2005, PlaneStation went out of business with €40m in debts, forcing EUjet to cease operations.

== History ==
The airline was established in 2003, commencing operations in May of that year. It was created by former Trans Aer head PJ McGoldrick, who linked with Fokker 100 leasing specialist Debis AirFinance to offer wet leases and charters. In 2004, the company moved into scheduled services. Airport operator PlaneStation completed its takeover of EUjet in January 2005 by acquiring the remaining 70% of the shares. It had bought the first 30% in May 2004. On 26 July 2005, the airline went into administration.

== Services ==
EUjet operated the following services (at July 2005):

* Ireland domestic destinations: Dublin and Shannon.
* UK destinations: Belfast, Edinburgh, Manchester, Kent International Airport and Newcastle.
* International scheduled destinations: Alicante, Amsterdam, Faro, Geneva (ski seasonal destination), Girona, Ibiza, Innsbruck, Málaga, Murcia, Nice, Palma de Mallorca, Prague, Salzburg and Valencia.

== Fleet ==
The EuJet fleet consisted of the following aircraft:


== Collapse ==
On 25 July 2005, trading in PlaneStation (EUjet&#x27;s parent company) shares was suspended. Passenger numbers were far down on expected figures and the company suffered a £6.5 million loss in the last half of 2004. The company stated that discussions with the banks have &quot;not been positive&quot;.

On 26 July 2005, all flights were suspended along with the operations of Kent International Airport for all bar freight traffic. Later in the day, EUjet went into voluntary administration leaving up to 5,000 passengers stranded abroad and 500 jobs in the balance.

Lack of passenger numbers are one reason cited for the failure of the airline, with only 330,000 out of the 500,000 passengers predicted for the first year of operation. In addition, the airline had been plagued with disruption and protest from people in Thanet, a significant proportion of whom were against any expansion of operations at Kent International Airport.

easyJet, a rival airline, offered to fly home the thousands of stranded EUjet customers for a flat fee of £25.

<doc id="1096206" wikidata="Q3784972" url="?curid=1096206" title="Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland">
<text>Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, 13th Baron de Ros of Helmsley, KG (23 September 152617 September 1563) was an English nobleman.

== Early life ==

Henry Manners was born 23 September 1526, the eldest son of Thomas Manners, 1st Earl of Rutland and his wife Eleanor Paston. He was married to Lady Margaret Neville on 3 July 1536. Henry was styled &quot;Lord Ros&quot; until his father&#x27;s death in 1543, after which he succeeded as the second earl of Rutland.

==Career==
Like his father, Earl Henry held many offices. As Warden of the Scottish Marches he reprieved the town of Haddington in June 1549, and recaptured Ferniehirst Castle. Whilst anxious to return home on account of his mother&#x27;s ill health in November 1549, he was required to investigate the activities of Thomas Wyndham a sailor who had captured merchant vessels in the Forth. In December 1549, his mother-in-law, the Dowager of Westmorland, complained to him that he had established a garrison of Italian soldiers at Bywell, one her villages. He was made admiral in 1556, and the following year was Captain-general of the cavalry at the siege of St Quentin under Mary I of England. Under Elizabeth I he served successfully and she made him Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire and Rutland, Knight of the Garter and President of the North. 

He completed his father&#x27;s design of Belvoir Castle in 1555, including &quot;preserving the monumental remains of his ancestors, by transferring them chiefly to Bottesford&quot;, from Belvoir Priory and Croxton Abbey.

After the untimely death of Edward VI in 1553, and the subsequent death of Edward Courtenay 1st Earl of Devon in 1556, Rutland stood as Heir presumptive as the senior male descendant of Richard 3rd Duke of York. James VI/I, the son of Mary Queen of Scots would not be born until 1566. His descent can be traced through Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter.

==Marriage and progeny==

He married twice:
* Firstly on 3 July 1536 to Margaret Neville (died 1559), daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland by whom he had three children: 
**Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland
**John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland
**Elizabeth Manners (c. 1553c. 1590), who married Sir William V Courtenay (1553–1630), &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Earl of Devon, of Powderham Castle, Devon.
* After Margaret&#x27;s death, he married Bridget Hussey, the widow of Richard Morrison. Her third husband was Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.

== Death and monument ==

Henry Manners died on 17 September 1563. In his last will, his instructions were to be buried in the Bottesford church and a &quot;tomb, suitable to his estate, should be made there&quot;. He is buried at St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Bottesford in Leicestershire. His tomb, in the centre of the chancel next to that of his father, is of alabaster and considered unique. The effigies lie beneath a decorated example of an Elizabethan dining table on heavy carved legs, suggesting an attempt to represent a communion table. Earl Henry is depicted in armour of conventional pattern except that the breastplate is made up of laminated plates. He wears a coronet and his head is supported on a tilt-heaume. He is wearing a chain nearly reaching his thighs, and the Order of the Garter is on the left leg. He holds a closed book in his right hand and a sword in his left. At his feet is a hornless unicorn. His wife, Margaret, also wears a coronet and is dressed in the style of the time, with an ermine-trimmed mantle. Her head rests on a scroll and her feet on a lion.

<text>Edward Manners, 3rd Earl of Rutland, 14th Baron de Ros of Helmsley, KG (12 July 1549 – 14 April 1587) was the son of Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, whose titles he inherited in 1563.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Henry Manners, 2nd Earl of Rutland, and Margaret, fourth daughter of Ralph Neville, 4th Earl of Westmorland. He seems to have been educated at Oxford, though he did not graduate there as a student. He bore the title of Lord Roos or Ros, the old title of his family, until 1563, when by the death of his father he became third Earl of Rutland.

He was made one of the queen&#x27;s wards, and was specially under the charge of Sir William Cecil, who was connected with him by marriage. He accompanied the queen on her visit to Cambridge in 1564, and was lodged in St. John&#x27;s College, and created M.A. on 10 August. In October 1566, he was made M.A. of Oxford. In 1569, he joined the Earl of Sussex, taking his tenants with him, and held a command in the army which suppressed the northern insurrection. In 1570, he passed into France, Cecil drawing up a paper of instructions for his guidance. He was in Paris in February of the next year. At home, he received many offices, and displayed enthusiastic devotion to the queen. On 5 August 1570, he became constable of Nottingham Castle, and steward, keeper, warden, and chief justice of Sherwood Forest; in 1571 he was feodary of the duchy of Lancaster for the counties of Nottingham and Derby; in 1574 he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Nottinghamshire.
On 17 June 1577, Rutland was placed on the ecclesiastical commission for the province of York, and in 1579 on the council of the north. In the grand tilting match of 1580, Rutland and twelve others contended with a similar number, headed by Essex, before the queen at Westminster. His public offices probably now absorbed all his time, as in 1581 a relative, John Manners, seems to have been managing his estate. On 23 April 1584, he became K.G., and on 14 June 1585 lord-lieutenant of Lincolnshire. His style of living was very expensive; when he went with his countess to London in about 1586 he had with him forty-one servants, including a chaplain, trumpeter, gardener, and apothecary. He bought a brooch with an agate stone engraved with a portrait of Elizabeth I and set around with 53 diamonds from Peter Vanlore.

In June 1586, with Lord Eure and Randolph, he arranged a treaty of peace with the Scots at Berwick, and his brother Roger wrote that his conduct had been approved by the court. On 6 October, he was one of the commissioners to try Mary Queen of Scots. The queen promised to make him lord chancellor after the death of Sir Thomas Bromley, which took place on 12 April 1587, and he was for a day or two so styled. He died, however, on 14 April 1587, at his house at Ivy Bridge in the Strand.

==Marriage and progeny==
On 6 June 1573 he married Isabel Holcroft, a daughter of Thomas Holcroft (1505-1558), a Member of Parliament and commissioner at the Dissolution of the Monasteries, who built a mansion house at Vale Royal on the site of the former Cistercian abbey. By his wife he had one child and sole heiress:
*Elizabeth Manners, 15th Baroness de Ros (1575-1591), who inherited the Barony of Ros, an ancient barony created by writ. The other titles created by letters patent were able to pass to a male heir only. Most of the estates were in tail male and similarly descended to the heir male.

==Death and burial==
He died on Good Friday at Puddle Wharf in the City of London, and was brought home for burial in Bottesford Church, Leicestershire, where his monument survives. The Earldom of Rutland and Barony of Manners went to his brother John Manners, 4th Earl of Rutland, but the Barony of de Ros was able to pass to his daughter.

==Legacy==

At Bottesford Church in Leicestershire there is the tomb commemorating the third Earl and his wife. It was created by Gerard Johnson the elder of Southwark, a Flemish craftsman. Earl Edward lies on a mat, wearing full plate armour. Instead of a gorget protecting his throat he wears a ruff. He wears the Order of the Garter on his left leg. His coronet has disappeared and at his feet is a decorated bull crest. Countess Isabel, daughter of Sir Thomas Holcroft, KT, wears a ruff with the usual dress of the time under an ermine-trimmed mantle, her head supported by a cushion. Her only daughter, Elizabeth, kneels at her feet. The inscription on the tomb lists the Earl&#x27;s activities in the Scottish &quot;troubles&quot; of the time.

<text>Ronald James Brown (born March 31, 1961) is an American former athlete and professional football player. He won a gold medal in the 4 × 100 metres relay at the 1984 Summer Olympics. Brown played as a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He went to Arizona State University.

==High school career==
Brown played high school football at powerhouse Baldwin Park High School in Baldwin Park, California until his senior year. He then moved to Northern California and played for Northgate High School in Walnut Creek.

==Track and field==

Brown was also a track star, he ran the second leg in the 4 × 100 metres relay team that won the gold medal and set the world record in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, with a time of 37.83 seconds.

Brown also competed in the 60 meters, 100 meters and 200 meters, posting personal bests of 6.64 seconds, 10.01 seconds and 20.44 seconds, respectively.

==Football career==
Brown was drafted in the second round of the 1983 draft by the Cleveland Browns, but never reported to them as he was training for the Olympics. The Browns traded their rights to the Los Angeles Rams, and Brown joined the Rams after the Olympics. He caught 23 passes in 1984 for 478 yards with four touchdowns as a rookie in 1984 before being tasked to return kicks the following year. In 1985, he returned 28 kicks for 918 yards for three touchdowns (his touchdowns and 32.8 yards per return were league highs). This resulted in Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors. Only his 1989 year would exceed that season, with him returning 47 (a league high) for 968 yards. In his eight seasons, he recorded 1,000 all-purpose yards (receiving + returns) four times (1985–87, 1989) before his career ended in 1990 at the age of 30.

Brown appeared in the 1986 Rams promotional video, &quot;Let&#x27;s Ram It&quot;, where he went by the name &quot;Speedball Brown&quot; and claimed to be the fastest man in town.

<doc id="1096220" wikidata="Q4638516" url="?curid=1096220" title="47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot">
<text>The 47th (Lancashire) Regiment of Foot was an infantry regiment of the British Army, raised in Scotland in 1741. It served in North America during the Seven Years&#x27; War and American Revolutionary War and also fought during the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War. Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 81st Regiment of Foot (Loyal Lincoln Volunteers) to form the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) in 1881.

==History==

===Formation and early service===

The regiment was raised in Scotland by Colonel Sir John Mordaunt as Sir John Mordaunt&#x27;s Regiment of Foot in 1741. In 1743, Peregrine Lascelles was appointed Colonel and until May 1745, the regiment was employed building a military road near Loch Lomond, part of a new route from Dumbarton to Inverary.

In July, Charles Stuart landed in Scotland to launch the 1745 Rising and two companies of Lascelles garrisoned Edinburgh Castle. The remaining eight companies fought at the Battle of Prestonpans in September, when the government army was swept aside in less than 20 minutes; most of the regiment was taken prisoner, except for Lascelles who fought his way out.

Lascelles, together with Sir John Cope, commander at Prestonpans, and his deputy Thomas Fowke, were tried by a court-martial in 1746; all three were exonerated, but Cope never held a senior command again.

As part of the reforms enacted by the Duke of Cumberland, the regiment was designated the 58th Regiment of Foot in 1747, before being re-numbered 47th Regiment of Foot in 1751.

===North America 1750–1794===
The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle awarded Britain sovereignty over the whole of Nova Scotia, including parts previously claimed by France. Between 1748 and 1755, conflict between British and French settlers resulted in a series of clashes known as Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War; the regiment was posted there in 1750, taking part in the siege of Grand Pré, the Battle at Chignecto and the Battle of Fort Beauséjour.

During the Seven Years&#x27; War, it was part of the force under James Wolfe that captured Louisbourg in 1758, allegedly earning the nickname &quot;Wolfe&#x27;s Own&quot;. It was also present at the 1759 Battle of the Plains of Abraham, the Battle of Sainte-Foy and the subsequent siege of Quebec in April to May 1760. It then took part in the final and decisive campaign between July and September 1760 when Montreal fell. The regiment returned to Britain when the war ended in 1763.

On the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1773, the 47th was posted to New Jersey. It took part in the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775 and the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775 and the Battles of Saratoga in September 1777. The main body of the regiment was interned as part of the Convention Army and did not return home for another six years. In 1782 the regiment was given a county distinction when it was given the title the 47th (The Lancashire) Regiment of Foot. In 1791 the regiment was sent to the West Indies where it was garrisoned during much of the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794 a second battalion was raised in Norfolk but disbanded soon afterwards.

===Napoleonic Wars===
In 1803, a second battalion was reformed and the following year deployed to Ireland. In 1806, the 1st battalion was sent to garrison the former Dutch settlement of the Cape of Good Hope, then joined the 1807 River Plate expedition under Sir Samuel Auchmuty, fighting at Montevideo in February and Buenos Aires in July. The battalion was deployed to India in 1808 and the following year its flank companies took part in an expedition to the Persian Gulf.

Meanwhile, the 2nd battalion was deployed to Gibraltar in 1809 and to Portugal in 1811 for service in the Peninsular War. The battalion took part in the Battle of Barrosa in March 1811 and the successful siege of Tarifa in December 1811. The battalion was victorious at the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813 and took part in the successful but bloody siege of San Sebastián in August 1813. At San Sebastián the battalion lost 17 of its 22 officers and almost half the other ranks. The battalion then crossed the River Bidasoa and pursued the French Army into France fighting at the Battle of the Nive in December 1813 and taking part in the Battle of Bayonne in April 1814 before returning home and being disbanded at Portsmouth.

===The Victorian era===
In 1817 the regiment was deployed to India and took part in the Third Anglo-Maratha War helping to defeat the Pindaris. It returned to the Persion Gulf in December 1819 to combat piracy off the shores of Ras al-Khaimah and was sent to Burma in 1824 for service in the First Anglo-Burmese War: it formed part of an army which advanced up the River Irrawaddy to the Kingdom of Ava before returning to India in 1826 and embarking for England in 1829.

The regiment was posted to the Ionian Islands in 1850 and to Malta in 1853 before landing at Calamity Bay in September 1854, as part of the 2nd Division, for service in the Crimean War. The regiment took part in the Battle of Alma in September 1854 and the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 as well as the siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. The regiment returned to Malta in 1856 and to England in 1857.

The regiment returned to Nova Scotia in 1861 to reinforce Canada&#x27;s defences during tension with the United States arising from the Trent Affair. It then helped defend Canada against Irish-American ex-soldiers during the Fenian raids in 1866. The regiment then went to Barbados in 1868 before landing in Ireland in 1870.

As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single-battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 47th was linked with the 81st Regiment of Foot (Loyal Lincoln Volunteers), and assigned to district no. 12 at Fulwood Barracks in Lancashire. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 81st Regiment of Foot (Loyal Lincoln Volunteers) to form the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire).

==Battle honours==
Battle honours won by the regiment were:

*Seven Years War: Louisbourg, Quebec 1759 (&quot;awarded to successor regiment, 1882&quot;)
*Peninsular War: Tarifa, Vittoria, San Sebastian, Nive, Peninsula (&quot;all awarded to successor regiment, 1910&quot;)
*Burmese Wars: Ava
*Crimean War: Alma, Inkerman, Sevastopol

==Victoria Cross==
After the inception of the Victoria Cross (VC) in 1856 Private John McDermond was awarded the only VC of the regiment for his actions in saving a wounded Colonel during the Battle of Inkerman.

<doc id="1096221" wikidata="Q435134" url="?curid=1096221" title="Sherman W. Tribbitt">
<text>Sherman Willard Tribbitt (November 9, 1922 – August 14, 2010) was an American merchant and politician from Odessa in New Castle County, Delaware. He was a World War II veteran and a member of the Democratic Party who served in the Delaware General Assembly, as the 17th lieutenant governor of Delaware, and as the 67th governor of Delaware.

==Early life and family==
Tribbitt was born in Denton, Maryland, the son of Sherman L. and Minnie Thawley Tribbitt. He married Jeanne Webb in 1943. They had three children, James, Carol, and Sherman &quot;Tip&quot;, and were members of the Presbyterian Church. He studied accounting at Beacom College in Wilmington, Delaware and briefly worked at the Security Trust Company in Wilmington. During World War II he served in the United States Navy. In early 1945 he was aboard the destroyer USS &quot;Frost&quot; in the North Atlantic when his unit received a Presidential Citation for sinking five U-boats.

==Professional and political career==
Following World War II, he and his father-in-law operated the Odessa Supply Company in Odessa, Delaware, where they lived.

In 1956, Tribbitt was elected to the first of four terms in the Delaware House of Representatives, where he served from 1957 to 1964. He was Speaker from 1959 to 1964. Tribbitt prevailed in a difficult convention contest for the nomination and was elected lieutenant governor of Delaware in 1964, defeating William T. Best, a State Representative from Rehoboth Beach. He served from January 19, 1965, to January 21, 1969. Surprised to find Governor Charles L. Terry Jr. wanted to serve two terms, Tribbitt had no choice but to run for a second term himself. Like Terry, he was narrowly defeated in the 1968 Republican landslide by Eugene Bookhammer, a State Senator from Lewes.

==Governor of Delaware==
Patiently planning a political recovery, Tribbitt was elected again to the Delaware House of Representatives in 1970 and was immediately elected minority leader for the 1971–72 session. When Governor Russell W. Peterson stumbled over the state&#x27;s finances, Tribbitt had another opportunity for the governorship and was elected governor in 1972, defeating Peterson by a vote of 117,274 (51%) to 109,583 (48%)

Tribbitt nearly made an appointment to the U.S. Senate. Future president Joe Biden was elected to the Senate in The same year Tribbitt was elected. On December 18, 1972, Biden&#x27;s wife and daughter died in a car crash which injured Biden&#x27;s sons. Biden contemplating on resigning his Senate seat, but decided to stay in the Senate up until his election as vice president 36 years later.

Tribbitt inherited the same state financial picture that forced his predecessor from office. In this time of high inflation there was constant pressure to raise salaries, particularly for teachers. Delaware&#x27;s income tax rates were already among the highest in the nation and the solution was not obvious. There was an effort to levy a large tax on the one oil refinery in the state, but that was derailed when the owner, J. Paul Getty, threatened to close it. The union workers there opposed the legislation out of fear for their jobs. But the most serious financial crises involved the near-collapse of the Farmers&#x27; Bank of Delaware. It was the state&#x27;s official bank, where all its funds were kept, and where many private investors had their life savings. The whole last year of Tribbitt&#x27;s administration was spent trying to rectify the situation. Eventually the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) agreed to make a large investment in the bank and buy many of its loans, but the state had to invest many millions as well. In 1981, under the next administration, the bank was sold.

Tribbitt took other steps to raise revenue, including beginning the Delaware Lottery. He also created the Department of Community Affairs and Economic Development to attract new industry to the state. Tribbitt sought a second term in 1976, but, largely because of the unresolved financial situation, lost to U.S. Representative Pete du Pont. by a vote of 130,531 (57%) to 97,480 (42%)


==Later career==
Tribbitt made another bid for governor in 1984, losing the Democratic primary to former Delaware Supreme Court justice William T. Quillen. In an unusual campaign tactic, Tribbitt refused to debate his courtroom-trained opponent, saying that he would lose the debate. After leaving office he worked with the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Diamond Group consulting firm. He relocated to Dover and finally to Rehoboth Beach.

==Death==
Sherman Tribbitt died on August 14, 2010, at the age of 87, a week after a severe fall. He had suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Jack Markell, Governor of Delaware at the time, ordered state flags lowered to half staff in Tribbitt&#x27;s honor.

==Almanac==
Elections are held the first Tuesday after November 1. Members of the Delaware General Assembly take office the second Tuesday of January. State Representatives have a two-year term. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor take office the third Tuesday of January and each has a four-year term.

<doc id="1096223" wikidata="Q554933" url="?curid=1096223" title="Juan José Flores">
<text>Juan José Flores y Aramburu (19 July 1800 – 1 October 1864) was a Venezuelan-born military general who became the first (in 1830), third (in 1839) and fourth (in 1843) President of the new Republic of Ecuador. He is often referred to as &quot;The Founder of the Republic&quot;.

==Character==
Juan José Flores&#x27; contemporaries described his physical appearance as a proud man in military uniform, slender and short but well proportioned, with a handsome countenance that radiates quick intelligence and a commanding presence. Juan José Flores appeared to be self-taught, and despite his scant rudimentary education, he became an eloquent orator and an avid reader of contemporary authors such as Rousseau, Montesquieu, Holbach, and Vattel. Juan José Flores was so fascinated with reading that in 1826 he asked for and received a shipment of books from General Santander, then vice-president of the Gran Colombia. Later in life, the professors of the University of Quito recognized Juan Jose Flores&#x27; efforts and bestowed an honorary doctorate on Flores in 1842.

==Early life==
Juan José Flores Aramburu was born on 19 July 1800, in the city of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, the illegitimate and only son of Juan José Aramburu, a rich and distinguished Spanish merchant from Spain, and to a Venezuelan, Rita Flores Bohorques. Eventually his father returned to Europe, abandoning his only son Juan José Flores and his mother to a life of extreme poverty. Because up to age 14 Juan José Flores received scant formal education, his impoverished mother placed him to learn and work in a Spanish military school and hospital. Since the poor yet sagacious Juan José Flores did not know what to do with his life at age 15, he enlisted as a private in the Spanish Royalist army of Spanish General Pablo Morillo, whose job it was to fight and destroy the patriot armies that were fighting for Spanish American independence in South America. During a short period of time Juan José Flores distinguished himself in the Spanish military for his loyalty, discipline, courage, heroism, and sagacity. However, as a sergeant, he was taken prisoner on 31 October 1817, and at this point he was convinced that freeing his homeland from Spain&#x27;s domination was a just cause and joined the patriot army of Simón Bolívar. In the Patriot army he became loyal and acquainted with Simon Bolivar, who at an early stage recognized Juan José Flores&#x27; outstanding heroism and military talents especially at the victory at the Battle of Carabobo (1821), that at age 23 he was promoted to Colonel and then to Commandant General of the recently freed Royalist city of Pasto.

==Political life==

On 13 May 1830, the day of Ecuador&#x27;s breaking away from Gran Colombia, Flores was named supreme chief of the new country, and then on 14 August 1830, he was named provisional president. His official term, however, did not start until 22 September 1830, 11 days after he was elected constitutional president by the assembly in Riobamba. That term lasted until 10 September 1834, and was marked with much turmoil. Flores faced a rebellion led by Luis Urdaneta, a loyalist of Simón Bolívar, who wanted to prevent Ecuador from leaving Gran Colombia. Flores also faced a threat from a member of the Ecuadorian congress, Vicente Rocafuerte, who attempted to overthrow him. Eventually, the two made an agreement – Rocafuerte would become president after Flores, and Flores would become leader of the military. Also during his term, he fought an invading Colombian army in 1832 and again starting in 1834, finally defeating them on 18 January 1835 in Miñarica, near Ambato. He was President of the Senate in 1837. 

Flores&#x27; second term began on 1 February 1839, and ended 15 January 1843. The beginning of his term was marked by peace and social development—he kept his word to rule justly and to defend freedom. However, in the last year of his term, he intervened militarily in the politics of Nueva Granada at the request of the Colombian government, fighting his old enemy, José María Obando. When later forced to intervene again, he was attacked by the Colombian army and his popularity at home fell. Then, after irregularities in the elections of 1842, he pushed to have the 1835 constitution annulled, and the new constitution, nicknamed the &quot;Carta de la esclavitud&quot; (&quot;charter of slavery&quot;) allowed him to continue in power for a third term, which began 1 April 1843. During this term, Flores fought to remain in power, but was ultimately overthrown on 6 March 1845 by a rebellion led by Rocafuerte and Vicente Ramón Roca, the man who became the next president of Ecuador.

==Death==

Flores died of uremia in 1864 while in campaign supporting the presidency of Gabriel García Moreno.

==Legacy==
Floreana Island in the Galapagos Archipelago is named for Flores.

<text>Good Housekeeping is an American lifestyle media brand that covers a wide range of topics from home decor and renovation, health, beauty and food, to entertainment, pets and gifts. The Good Housekeeping Institute which opened its &quot;Experiment Station&quot; in 1900, specializes in product reviews by a staff of scientific experts. The GH Institute is known, in part, for the &quot;Good Housekeeping Seal&quot;, a limited warranty program that evaluates products to ensure they perform as intended.

&quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; was founded in 1885 by American publisher and poet Clark W. Bryan. By the time of its acquisition by the Hearst Corporation in 1911, the magazine had grown to a circulation of 300,000 subscribers. By the early 1960s, it had over five million subscribers and was one of the world&#x27;s most popular lifestyle magazines.

==History and profile==

On May 2, 1885, Clark W. Bryan founded &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; in Holyoke, Massachusetts, as a fortnightly magazine. The magazine became a monthly publication in 1891.

The magazine achieved a circulation of 300,000 by 1911, at which time it was bought by the Hearst Corporation. It topped one million in the mid-1920s, and continued to rise, even during the Great Depression and its aftermath. In 1938, a year in which the magazine advertising dropped 22 percent, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; showed an operating profit of $2,583,202, more than three times the profit of Hearst&#x27;s other eight magazines combined, and probably the most profitable monthly of its time. Circulation topped 2,500,000 in 1943, 3,500,000 in the mid-1950s, 5,000,000 in 1962, and 5,500,000 per month in 1966. 1959 profits were more than $11 million.

&quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; was one of the &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;, a group of women&#x27;s service magazines, and is one of the three of them still published in print.

In 1922, the Hearst Corporation created a British edition along the same lines, named &quot;British Good Housekeeping&quot;.

Famous writers who have contributed to the magazine include A. J. Cronin, Betty Friedan, Frances Parkinson Keyes, Clara Savage Littledale, Edwin Markham, Somerset Maugham, Edna St. Vincent Millay, J. D. Salinger, Evelyn Waugh, and Virginia Woolf. Other contributors include advice columnists, chefs, and politicians.

==Good Housekeeping Institute== 

In 1900, the &quot;Experiment Station&quot;, the predecessor to the Good Housekeeping Research Institute (GHRI), now known as the Good Housekeeping Institute, was founded. In 1902, the magazine was calling this &quot;An Inflexible Contract Between the Publisher and Each Subscriber&quot;. The formal opening of the headquarters of the GH Institute – the &quot;Model Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Testing Station for Household Devices&quot;, and &quot;Domestic Science Laboratory&quot; – occurred in January 1910.

In 1909, the magazine established the Good Housekeeping Seal. Products advertised in the magazine that bear the GH Seal are tested by GH Institute experts and are backed by a two-year limited warranty. About 5,000 products have been given the seal.

In April 1912, a year after Hearst bought the magazine, Harvey W. Wiley, the first commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (1907–1912), became head of the Good Housekeeping Research Institute and a contributing editor whose &quot;Question Box&quot; feature ran for decades. Beginning with a &quot;Beauty Clinic&quot; in 1932, departments were added to the Institute, including a &quot;Baby&#x27;s Center&quot;, &quot;Foods and Cookery&quot;, and a &quot;Needlework Room&quot;. Some functioned as testing laboratories, while others were designed to produce editorial copy.

In 1924, the British Good Housekeeping magazine set up its own Good Housekeeping Institute at 49 Wellington Street in Covent Garden, London. Its first director was Dorothy Cottington Taylor who ran the &quot;a highly organised laboratory for testing and investigating every kind of household appliance, method, and recipe&quot; for sixteen years.

After the passage of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture Rexford Tugwell sought to promote a government grading system. The Hearst Corporation opposed the policy in spirit, and began publishing a monthly tabloid attacking federal oversight. In 1939, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; for &quot;misleading and deceptive&quot; guarantees including the Seal, and &quot;exaggerated and false&quot; claims in its advertisements. The publisher fought the proceedings for two years, during which time competing editors from the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot; and &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; testified against &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;. The FTC&#x27;s ultimate ruling was against the magazine, forcing it to remove some claims and phraseology from its ad pages. The words &quot;Tested and Approved&quot; were dropped from the Seal. But the magazine&#x27;s popularity was unaffected, steadily rising in circulation and profitability. In 1962, the wording of the Seal was changed to a guarantee of &quot;Product or Performance&quot;, while dropping its endorsement of rhetorical promises made by the advertisers. In its varying forms, the Seal became inextricably associated with the magazine, and many others (e.g., &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Parents&quot;, and &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;) mimicked the practice.

==International editions==
&quot;Good Housekeeping&quot; began to be published in the United Kingdom in 1922. William Randolph Hearst appointed Alice Maud Head initially as assistant editor. Head rose to be the managing director, as well as purportedly being the highest paid woman in Europe. As Hearst&#x27;s deputy, Head would make decisions on his behalf about not just editing, but also buying for him St Donat&#x27;s Castle, expensive art objects, and three giraffes for his zoo. Head remained head until 1939.

In Latin America, a Spanish version of the magazine, titled &quot;Buenhogar&quot;, was published in the United States and Latin America by the Televisa corporation in Mexico from 1965, under license from the Hearst Corporation.

In Russia, the magazine was published first as &quot;Domashny Ochag&quot; (&quot;Good Home, or Hearth&quot;), before changing its name to &quot;Novy Ochag&quot; (&quot;New Home, or Hearth&quot;) sometime in July 2022. Published by Independent Media, and described as &quot;a resource for women who take care of their homes, raise children, have successful careers and help others&quot;, &quot;Novy Ochag&quot; recorded a digital readership of 13 million in October 2023.

<text>Doerfel is a lunar impact crater that is located in the vicinity of the southern pole, just on the far side of the Moon. It lies approximately midway between the large crater Hausen to the east-northeast and the even larger Zeeman to the southwest.

The outer wall of Doerfel retains much of its original form, but it has been rounded and slightly eroded by a history of subsequent bombardment. Many tiny craterlets lie on or near the rim, especially along the western edge. There is a slight outward extrusion in the southern rim, and the opposite, northern rim appears somewhat jumbled and eroded.

Doerfel&#x27;s interior is also marked by several tiny craterlets in the otherwise relatively flat surface. There is a very slight central rise near the midpoint.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Doerfel.

<text>Maurice Daniel Robert Malpas (born 3 August 1962) is a Scottish former football player and coach. He signed for Dundee United in 1979 and spent his entire professional playing career with the club until his retirement in 2000. With him, United were Scottish champions in 1983 and Scottish Cup winners in 1994. European runs there included reaching the 1983–84 European Cup semi final and the 1987 UEFA Cup final.

Malpas made his debut for the Scotland national team in 1984. He went on to gain 55 caps, making him a member of the Scotland national football team roll of honour. He played for Scotland at two World Cups and one UEFA European Championship final tournaments.
Malpas began a coaching career in 1991 whilst still a Dundee United player, continuing as a coach after his retirement until leaving the club in 2003. He joined Motherwell as assistant manager to Terry Butcher before becoming manager from 2006 until 2007. He coached the Scotland under-21 team on a temporary basis before another brief spell in club management with Swindon Town during 2008. More recently he has been assistant manager to Butcher at both Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Hibernian.

==Early life==

Malpas was born on 3 August 1962 in Dunfermline, Fife, and attended Queen Anne High School.

==Playing career==
===Dundee United===
He trained with Dunfermline Athletic before joining Leven Royals under-14s team.

He signed for Dundee United in August 1979. His total of 830 competitive first team appearances is the second highest in the club&#x27;s history. Malpas initially combined his football career with studying for an electrical engineering degree at Dundee College of Technology (now Abertay University), and didn&#x27;t become a full-time professional until 1984. Despite this, he made his debut in for Dundee United in 1981 and won the Scottish Football League Premier Division title in 1983. In the subsequent 1983–84 European Cup, United reached the semi-final.

United made it to the final of the 1986–87 UEFA Cup; en route they defeated Terry Venables&#x27; FC Barcelona side home and away in the quarter-final, and inflicted a first home defeat on Borussia Mönchengladbach in 55 European games going back to 1970 in the semi-final. They lost 2–1 on aggregate to IFK Gothenburg in the final, the second leg of which was their 70th match of the season.

United and Malpas played in five Scottish Cup finals in nine years: in 1985 they took the lead but lost 2–1 to Celtic. In 1987 (played in between the two legs of the UEFA Cup final) they lost 1–0 St Mirren. In 1988 against Celtic, the pattern of 1985 was almost repeated but this time it was an even later goal which defeated United. In 1991, they suffered a 4–3 extra time defeat to Motherwell. Captain Malpas lifted the trophy when Craig Brewster scored the only goal in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final win against Rangers.

Malpas won the SFWA Footballer of the Year award in 1991. His long service was rewarded with two testimonial matches, in 1991 and 2000. He was inducted into the Dundee United Hall of Fame as one of its inaugural members in 2008.

===Scotland===
Winning first of his caps in 1984, Malpas is the most recent part-time professional to have played for Scotland. He won 55 caps in total. In his 50th international appearance (away to Norway in June 1992) he was made captain to mark the occasion. He had previously captained Scotland in a 1990 Euro 1992 qualifying match against Bulgaria. He appeared for Scotland at the 1986 and 1990 World Cups and at Euro 1992.

==Coaching and managerial career==
After retiring as a player, Malpas assumed full-time coaching duties at Tannadice, having been acting as player/coach since 1991. He was part of the temporary management team following the dismissal of Alex Smith in October 2002, but left the club in January 2003.

He initially joined Motherwell as assistant manager to former coaching colleague Terry Butcher. Malpas became Motherwell manager in May 2006, following Butcher&#x27;s departure to coach Sydney FC. He left the club in June 2007 after one season in charge, having taken the team from a comfortable mid-table position to one that narrowly avoided relegation. Malpas became caretaker manager of the Scotland under-21 team in August 2007, but missed out on the permanent position to Billy Stark.

In January 2008, Malpas became manager of Swindon Town after the takeover of the club by local businessman Andrew Fitton, replacing former Dundee United teammate Paul Sturrock. Malpas was sacked by chairman Andrew Fitton on 14 November 2008 after a poor run of results and shock exits in the FA Cup to Histon and in the Football League Trophy within a week. He joined Terry Butcher again as assistant, this time at SPL club Inverness Caledonian Thistle. In 2013, Malpas moved with Butcher to Hibernian, rejecting the chance to manage Inverness. Butcher and Malpas both left Hibernian in June 2014, after the club had been relegated from the Scottish Premiership.

Malpas became director of football at Raith Rovers on 26 December 2014. He left Raith Rovers on 22 May 2015 and was inducted to the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in October 2015.

Malpas returned to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in April 2017, working for manager Richie Foran.

<text>Dawson is a lunar impact crater that lies on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It lies across a crater triplet: the southeast rim is intruding into the crater Alekhin; the northwest rim also intrudes into the larger satellite crater Dawson V, and the northeast rim is attached to the comparably sized Dawson D. To the south of this formation is the large crater Zeeman. West of Dawson is the crater Crommelin, and to the north lies Fizeau.

Dawson is a relatively young formation that lies in the midst of a field of ancient, heavily eroded craters. The outer rim is nearly circular, but slightly distorted due to the craters it overlaps. The western rim is slightly flattened where it overlaps Dawson V. The crater formation shows little appearance of wear, with only a small craterlet across the northwest rim and another inside the northeast rim. The interior is irregular with some slight s along parts of the inner wall.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Dawson.

<text>The Great Powers ratified the terms of the Constantinople Arrangement in connection with the border between Greece and the Ottoman Empire in the London Protocol of 30 August 1832, which marked the end of the Greek War of Independence and established modern Greece as an independent state free of the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Constantinople was the product of the London Conference of 1832 which opened in February 1832 with the participation of the Great Powers (Britain, France and Russia) on the one hand and the Ottoman Empire on the other. The factors which shaped the treaty included the refusal of Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to assume the Greek throne. He was not at all satisfied with the Aspropotamos–Spercheios line, which replaced the more favorable Arta–Volos line considered by the Great Powers earlier.

The withdrawal of Leopold as a candidate for the throne of Greece, and the July Revolution in France, delayed the final settlement of the frontiers of the new kingdom until a new government was formed in London. Lord Palmerston, who took over as British Foreign Secretary, agreed to the Arta-Volos borderline. However, the secret note on Crete, which the Bavarian plenipotentiary communicated to the Courts of Britain, France and Russia, bore no fruit.

Under the protocol signed on 7 May 1832 between Bavaria and the protecting Powers, and basically dealing with the way in which the Regency was to be managed until Otto reached his majority (while also concluding the second Greek loan, for a sum of £2,400,000 sterling), Greece was defined as an independent kingdom, with the Arta-Volos line as its northern frontier. The Ottoman Empire was indemnified in the sum of 40,000,000 piastres for the loss of the territory. The borders of the Kingdom were reiterated in the London Protocol of 30 August 1832 signed by the Great Powers, which ratified the terms of the Constantinople Arrangement in connection with the border between Greece and the Ottoman Empire and marked the end of the Greek War of Independence creating modern Greece as an independent state free of the Ottoman Empire.

<doc id="1096255" wikidata="Q4944889" url="?curid=1096255" title="Jenny Diski">
<text>Jenny Diski FRSL (née Simmonds; 8 July 1947 – 28 April 2016) was an English novelist, non-fiction writer and memoirist. 

Diski was a regular contributor to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;; the collections &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Why Didn&#x27;t You Do What You Were Told?&quot; collect articles and essays written for the publication. Her memoirs include &quot;In Gratitude&quot;, &quot;The Sixties&quot;, &quot;Skating to Antarctica&quot;, and &quot;Stranger on a Train: Daydreaming and Smoking around America With Interruptions&quot;, for which she won the 2003 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award.

== Early life ==

Diski was a troubled teenager with a difficult family background. Her parents were working-class Jewish immigrants to London. Her father, James Simmonds (born Israel Zimmerman), made his living on the black market. He deserted the family when Diski was aged six. This caused her mother, Rene (born Rachel Rayner), to have a nervous breakdown, and Diski was then put into foster care. Her father came back, but left permanently when she was aged eleven. She was taken in and mentored by the novelist Doris Lessing; she lived in Lessing&#x27;s house for four years. Diski was educated at University College London, and worked as a teacher during the 1970s and early 1980s.

Diski spent much of her youth as a psychiatric inpatient or outpatient. At the same time, she immersed herself deeply in the culture of the 60s, from the Aldermaston marches to the Grosvenor Square Protests of 1968, from drugs to free love, from jazz to acid rock, and a flirtation with the ideas and methods of R. D. Laing. Taken into the London home of the novelist Doris Lessing, who was a school-friend&#x27;s mother, Diski resumed her education and by the start of the 1970s was training as a teacher, starting the Freightliners free school and having her first publication.

== Writings ==

Over the decades, Diski was a prolific writer of fiction and non-fiction articles, reviews and books. Many of her early books tackle themes such as depression, sado-masochism and madness. Some of her later writings, such as &quot;Apology for the Woman Writing&quot; (about the French writer Marie de Gournay), strike a more positive note, while her spare, ironic tone, using all the resources of magic realism, provides a unique take on even the most distressing material. Compared at times with her mentor Lessing as both were concerned with the thinking woman, Diski has been called a post-postmodernist for her abiding distrust of logical systems of thought, whether postmodern or not. Diane Gagneret states that Diski&#x27;s writings about depression and &quot;madness&quot; mirror those of Doris Lessing. Lynne Segal concurs, writing that the &quot;smart but cynical&quot; Diski could echo &quot;her former surrogate parent and mentor&quot;.

=== Fiction ===

Diski wrote eleven novels. Her first novel &quot;Nothing Natural&quot; was about a sadomasochistic affair. Her only collection of short stories, &quot;The Vanishing Princess&quot;, published in England in 1995, was described as being about &quot;pleasure, the writing life, the difficulties of family life, and the rules governing femininity.&quot;

=== Non-fiction ===

In &quot;The Sixties&quot;, Diski described her experience as a young woman starting out in life: &quot;I lived in London during that period, regretting the Beats, buying clothes, going to movies, dropping out, reading, taking drugs, spending time in mental hospitals, demonstrating, having sex, teaching&quot;. She also described the decade&#x27;s pervasive sexism, institutionalised in the countercultural cult of casual sex, asserting that &quot;On the basis that no means no, I was raped several times by men who arrived in my bed and wouldn&#x27;t take no for an answer&quot;. In the book, Diski returns repeatedly to the question of how far the cult of the self in the permissive society gave rise to 1980s neoliberalism, greed and self-interest. She concludes that, in the words of Charles Shaar Murray, &quot;The line from hippie to yuppie is not nearly as convoluted as people like to believe&quot;. 

Her 1997 memoir &quot;Skating to Antarctica&quot;, ostensibly about a journey to see the Antarctic ice, also tells much about Diski&#x27;s early life. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; comments that &quot;Antarctica is not so much a destination as a symptom in this intense, disturbing memoir of a wickedly unpleasant childhood.&quot; Diski likens the bleak whiteness of the icescape to the safety of the unbroken whiteness of the psychiatric hospital of her depressed youth. In her obituary of Diski, Kate Kellaway calls &quot;Skating to Antarctica&quot; &quot;the most remarkable of her books. It stars her daughter, Chloe, who steers Diski into finding out what became of her mother, with whom relations had been severed for decades. The narrative alternates startlingly between a trip to the frozen south and this search—Diski&#x27;s reluctant advance towards catharsis.&quot;

Her 2010 non-fiction work, &quot;What I Don&#x27;t Know About Animals&quot;, examines the ambiguous status of pet animals in Western society, at once sentimentalised and brutalised, or all too often abandoned. Nicholas Lezard, reviewing the book in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, admires Diski as &quot;one of the language&#x27;s great, if under-appreciated, stylists&quot;, in this case where &quot;her honest, direct and intelligent prose has produced an honest, direct and intelligent look at relations between ourselves and the animal world.&quot;

Diski&#x27;s final, valedictory, book, &quot;In Gratitude&quot;, was published shortly before her death in 2016. In it, she &quot;elegant[ly]&quot; takes a tour of her life, knowing she was soon to die of an aggressive and inoperable cancer. She rejects the usual &quot;cancer clichés&quot;, instead going back to her time with Lessing, meeting other famous literary figures including Robert Graves, Alan Sillitoe, Lindsay Anderson, and R. D. Laing. The &quot;Kirkus&quot; reviewer sums up the book as &quot;Sometimes rueful, often oblique, but provocative and highly readable.&quot;

== Personal life ==
She married Roger Marks in 1976, and they jointly chose the name Diski. Their daughter Chloe was born in 1977. The couple separated in 1981 and divorced. Her later partner until the end of her life, Ian Patterson, known as &quot;the Poet&quot; in Diski&#x27;s writings, is a poet, translator and was director of studies in English at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

In June 2014, Diski was told that she had at best another three years to live. In September 2014, she announced that she had been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. She died on 28 April 2016.

<text>Fizeau is a prominent lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, in the southern hemisphere. Nearby craters of note include Minkowski to the west-northwest, and Eijkman to the southwest.

The inner wall of the crater rim is multiply d in the northern half, while the southern rim has a shear inner surface leading down to slumped deposits on the crater floor. There is a small but prominent crater lying across the southwest rim, with an inner surface that forms terraced steps covering most of the interior. There are also smaller craterlets on the rim to the northeast and west-southwest.

The interior of Fizeau is relatively flat beyond the terraces, with only a few low rises in the northwest section of the crater and a central peak near the midpoint. Only a few tiny craterlets are located on the floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fizeau.
