<text>Jaromír Vejvoda (28 March 1902 – 13 November 1988) was a Czech composer. He is best known as the author of the &quot;Beer Barrel Polka&quot;.

==Life and work==
Vejvoda was born and died in Prague-Zbraslav. From 1936 to 1960, he lived in Vrané nad Vltavou, after he married the local native Božena Zamrazilová.

He learned to play the fiddle and flugelhorn in a band led by his father. Later he played these instruments in a military band. He started to compose in the 1920s while he worked as a bartender in a pub owned by his father-in-law. In 1929 he wrote the &quot;Modřanská polka&quot; named after Modřany, a suburb of Prague where it was played the first time. This catchy tune became a hit and allowed Vejvoda to pursue music as a full-time professional. It was published in 1934 with lyrics &quot;Škoda lásky, kterou jsem tobě dala...&quot; Publishing house Shapiro Bernstein acquired the rights shortly before World War II and the polka, now the &quot;Beer Barrel Polka&quot; with the English lyrics &quot;Roll out the barrel...&quot;, became the most popular song of the Allies in the West, although the original Czech lyrics have a very different meaning and do not speak about beer. After the war this polka became popular around the world, in German-speaking countries as &quot;Rosamunde&quot;.

Vejvoda wrote many other hits, such as &quot;Kdyby ty muziky nebyly&quot; (&quot;If those bands did not exist&quot;) and &quot;Já ráda tancuju&quot; (&quot;I love to dance&quot;) but none of them became popular outside of the Czech and German speaking countries.

Vejvoda had three sons: Jaromír, Jiří and Josef. Josef continues the family tradition of being musician, composer and bandleader. His granddaughter Zuzana is a musical actress.

<text>BSD/OS is a proprietary Unix-like operating system first released in 1993 as BSD/386. It was originally developed and sold by Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDi) and designed to be a Unix for 386-based PCs. It was built off the Net/2 distribution of BSD, on which the developers had previously contributed to.

Eventually the operating system was also ported to support PowerPC and SPARC architectures, and consequently was retitled to BSD/OS as of version 2.0 (1995). In 2001, BSDi sold the rights of the OS to Wind River Systems who developed and released version 5.0 in 2003 before discontinuing the product.

BSD/OS had a reputation for reliability in server roles; the renowned Unix programmer and author W. Richard Stevens used it for his own personal web server.

==History==
BSDi was formed in 1991 by members of the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at UC Berkeley to develop and sell a proprietary version of BSD Unix for PC compatible systems with Intel 386 (or later) processors. This made use of work previously done by Bill Jolitz to port BSD to the PC platform. BSDi had distributed over 300 copies of the beta version of BSD/386 by August 1992.

BSD/386 1.0 was released in March 1993. The company sold licenses and support for it, taking advantage of terms in the BSD License which permit use of the BSD software in proprietary systems, as long the author is credited. The company in turn contributed code and resources to the development of non-proprietary BSD operating systems. In the meantime, Jolitz had left BSDi and independently released a free software BSD for PCs, called 386BSD. The BSDi system features complete and thorough manpage documentation for the entire system, including complete syntax and argument explanations, examples, file usage, authors, and cross-references to other commands.

BSD/386 licenses (including source code) were priced at $995, lower than AT&amp;T UNIX System V source licenses, a fact highlighted in their advertisements. As part of the settlement of &quot;USL v. BSDi&quot;, BSDI substituted code that had been written for the university&#x27;s 4.4 BSD-Lite release for disputed code in their OS, effective with release 2.0. By the time of this release, the &quot;386&quot; designation had become dated, and BSD/386 was renamed &quot;BSD/OS&quot;. Later releases of BSD/OS also support Sun SPARC-based systems. BSD/OS 5.x versions are available for PowerPC too.

The marketing of BSD/OS became increasingly focused on Internet server applications. However, the increasingly tight market for Unix-compatible software in the late 1990s and early 2000s hurt sales of BSD/OS. On one end of the market, it lacked the certification of the Open Group to bear the UNIX trademark, and the sales force and hardware support of the larger Unix vendors. Simultaneously, it lacked the negligible acquisition cost of the open source BSDs and Linux. BSD/OS was acquired by Wind River Systems in April 2001. Wind River discontinued sales of BSD/OS at the end of 2003, with support terminated at the end of 2004.

<text>Roy Maxwell Alvis (born February 2, 1938) is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a third baseman from through , most notably for the Cleveland Indians (now the Cleveland Guardians) where he became a two-time All-Star. He played his final season with the Milwaukee Brewers.

==Early life==
Alvis was born on February 2, 1938, in Jasper, Texas, and graduated from Jasper High School (Jasper, Texas). He attended the University of Texas at Austin, where he played both football (under coaching legend Darrell Royal) and baseball, leading the Southwest Conference in batting average. 

==Professional career==

=== Minor league ===
Alvis was signed by the Cleveland Indians as an amateur free agent in 1958. He played in Cleveland&#x27;s minor league system from 1959 to 1962. In 1960, he had a .343 batting average for the Minot Mallards of the Class-C Northern League. In 1962, playing for the Triple-A Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League, Alvis hit .319, with 25 home runs, 113 runs scored, 91 runs batted in (RBI), 35 doubles, 11 triples and a .921 on-base plus slugging percentage (OPS).

On the downside, Alvis was error prone as a fielder. As a third basemen, he had 44 errors in 115 games in 1959, and 42 in 115 games in 1960. He improved somewhat with 24 errors in 115 games in 1961, and 39 in 150 games in 1962. He best minor league fielding percentage was .935.

=== Major league ===
Alvis was called up to Cleveland at the end of the 1962 season, and he played his first major league game on September 11, 1962.

Alvis became the everyday third baseman for the Indians in . He enjoyed single-season career-high numbers in batting average (.274), RBI (67), runs (81), hits (165), doubles (32) and triples (7). He added 22 home runs (also a personal high), and appeared to be on his way to stardom. He was 17th in MVP voting. He still had fielding issues, with 28 errors (fourth worst in the major leagues among all third basemen) and a .942 fielding percentage, though he led the league&#x27;s third basemen with 170 putouts. He also led the league in being hit by pitches (10).

In late June 1964, Alvis was hospitalized with spinal meningitis. He was diagnosed on a flight back from playing in Minnesota. All the players and crew who flew with him from Minnesota before his diagnosis and hospitalization received cautionary treatment to prevent the disease from spreading. His condition improved with treatment within a day, but he was placed on the disabled list and Chico Salmon was called up to replace him. Before Alvis was hospitalized, Cleveland was 13 wins over .500; in his absence, the team&#x27;s record was 11 wins and 25 losses.

Alvis was out for six weeks. He still hit 18 homers in only 381 at-bats, playing in only 107 games. His batting average fell to .252. However, his fielding percentage improved to .955, the highest it had been to date at any level of professional baseball.

Alvis made a remarkable comeback in , and was an essential part of the team. He scored 88 runs and hit 21 home runs (though his average fell to .247), and was rewarded by being selected for the All-Star game, representing the American League (AL). Playing behind Brooks Robinson, Alvis only had one at bat in the All-Star game. In 1965, his fielding percentage rose again (.958), improving to 19 errors in 156 games (though still third worst in the AL), and again leading AL third basemen in putouts with 169. He also led the league again in being hit by pitches (9).

Alvis turned in a solid 18 home run performance in and led the team with 21 in , batting .245 and .256 respectively in those years. He was selected to the All-Star team again in 1967, appearing only as a pinch hitter. He led the league in putouts both years, with 180 and 169 respectively. His batting average fell to .223 as a full-time player in 1968, and he was relegated to spot duty with Cleveland in 1969, appearing in only 66 games. His fielding percentages from 1966-1968 were .958. 965 and .960.

Alvis was traded along with Russ Snyder from the Indians to the Brewers for Roy Foster, Frank Coggins and cash during spring training on April 4, 1970. This was the Brewers first year in existence after moving from Seattle. As a backup in Milwaukee, he hit .183 with three homers in 62 games, being released at the end of the season.

Over his nine year career, Alvis hit .247, with 111 home runs, 421 runs scored, and 373 RBI.

=== Spinal meningitis and career ===
Alvis never recovered the same physical qualities after suffering from spinal meningitis. His Cleveland teammate Sam McDowell observed that Alvis was the most decent person he met in baseball, and the most disciplined and well-conditioned player on the team; rarely drinking alcohol (unusual for the time). After suffering from spinal meningitis, Alvis never regained his earlier strength, stamina or endurance.

== Post baseball career ==
After retiring, Alvis returned to Jasper, Texas, and worked at the First National Bank of Jasper, rising from loan officer to vice-president to president.

== Personal life ==
He and his wife Frances Mae (Eddy) Alvis were married on August 23, 1958, and had two sons, Max, Jr. and David. From 1985 to 1987, David played first base in Cleveland&#x27;s minor league system. His grandson Sam Alvis pitched in the Miami Marlins minor league system from 2013-2015.

<text>Veronika Cherkasova (, ; ; January 12, 1959 – October 20, 2004) was a Belarusian journalist. She was killed on October 20, 2004. As of 2021, the killer has not been found.

==Biography==
Veronika Cherkasova was born in Minsk, Belarus, January 12, 1959. She worked on TV in the 1980s, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union she worked for various independent opposition newspapers: &quot;Belorusskaya Delovaya Gazeta&quot; (in the 1990s), &quot;BelGazeta&quot; (1995–2003) and, finally, in 2003–2004 for &quot;Salidarnaść&quot; (Solidarity) newspaper. Later she specialized in investigative journalism and wrote about social issues, including articles about religious sects and Romani communities in Belarus, but also she published several articles about illegal arms trade between Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s Belarus and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq. She visited Iraq in 2002 as a member of a journalists&#x27; group invited to the country by a Belarusian businessmen who had partners in Iraq.

== Murder ==

Cherkasova was murdered in her Minsk apartment on October 20, 2004. She received more than 40 stabs, mostly in the throat and hands. Her body was discovered by her teenage son Anton Filimonov and step-father Vladimir Melezhko, when Cherkasova’s mother got worried that the daughter did not show up at work and did not answer phone calls.

The killer has never been found. No signs of break-in were found, presumably, Cherkasova opened the door herself. The journalists who witnessed the start of investigative actions recall that policemen said “We’ve got to take the pioneer” meaning Veronika’s son. The boy was questioned without lawyer or relatives, threatened, pressured and had to flee to Moscow to his father Dmitry Filimonov. When he was notified that no charges would be pressed on him, the boy returned to Minsk and was arrested for allegedly forging currency. He was released on bail in April 2006. Anton Filimonov developed severe depression and was hospitalized to psychiatric hospital. Cherkasova’s step-father was also pressured by the investigators who tried to make him confess in the murder. World Association of News Publishers, IFEX and other international organizations condemned harassment of Cherkasova’s family and urged Belarusian authorities to make the case&#x27;s investigation clear and fair.

The official investigation was suspended in December 2005, restarted in February 2006, and suspended again on March 14, 2006, citing lack of indictable suspects. Authorities have never agreed to link Cherkasova’s murder to her professional activities. According to the RSF, the investigation ignored crucial evidence that proved the killing to be connected with her work. According to the journalists, the only things that disappeared from her flat were some photos taken during the last trip to Iraq.

On October 19, 2012, a group of unidentified people tried to break into the Minsk apartment where Cherkasova’s mother, father and son live. The family stated that they experienced multiple visits of the police since 2004, their home was searched in 2008.

As of 2021, the case is still not solved and the murderer has not been found.

<text>Allsvenskan (; ), also known as Fotbollsallsvenskan (, ) is a Swedish professional league for men&#x27;s association football clubs. It was founded in 1924 and is the top tier of the Swedish football league system, operating on a system of promotion and relegation with Superettan. Seasons run from late March or early April to the beginning of November, with the 16 clubs all meeting each other twice, resulting in a 30-match season, for a total of 240 matches league-wide.

Allsvenskan is ranked 23rd in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the last five years. Allsvenskan is currently ranked third highest of the leagues in Scandinavia after Norway and Denmark. The current champions are Malmö FF, who won the title in the 2024 season.

The three teams with most Swedish championships are Malmö FF (24), IFK Göteborg (18) and IFK Norrköping (13), all of which still playing as of 2024.

. Unlike other European football leagues, the Allsvenskan did not experience an interruption in play during World War II due to Swedish neutrality.

==History==

In the 1910s, national league play had been tried in Sweden with Svenska Serien, however it turned out it was hard to finance the play. Svenska Serien evolved into two series, consisting of a southern and northern group.

On 13 January 1924, football clubs met in Stockholm to found a nationwide series and on 3 August later in the year the opening game was played of the 1924–25 Allsvenskan. The first winner of the one-league twelve team Allsvenskan was GAIS. In 1931, the league started to decide the Swedish football champions.

In the early years, Norrland and Gotland teams were not allowed to play on higher levels in the league system, which was gradually changed to include the Norrland and Gotland teams on higher levels.

For the 1959 Allsvenskan, the season start was changed from autumn to spring to be played in one calendar year. In 1973, it was expanded to contain 14 teams. In the 1970s, Malmö FF, under the lead of Spanish Antonio Durán and later English Bob Houghton, won five Allsvenskan and managed to proceed to the 1979 European Cup final, which they lost to Nottingham Forest.

From the 1982 season, the league introduced a play-off to determine the Swedish football champions. In the late 1980s, Malmö FF were dominant, winning the league five times in a row, but only two Swedish championships. The 1990 season saw the introduction of three points per win. The play-off season years were followed by two years of continuation league, named Mästerskapsserien.

The 1993 season saw a return to the classical format, again with 14 teams. IFK Göteborg won five Allsvenskan league titles in the 1990s.

In the early 2000s, Djurgårdens IF won three titles (2002, 2003 and 2005). In 2004, Örebro SK lost its place in the league due to financial problems, and Assyriska FF got their place. Since 2008, the league consists of 16 teams.

For the 2017 season, a league match ball was introduced and Select Sport was chosen as supplier for four years.

The 2024 season marked 100 years of existence for Allsvenskan and was celebrated with retro kits during two match days in August. Malmö FF won the centennial Allsvenskan and took their ninth title in the last 15 seasons.

== Status ==

The champions are considered Swedish champions and gold medal winners. The runners-up are awarded the &quot;large silver&quot; medal, the third positioned team are awarded the &quot;small silver&quot; medal and the team positioned in fourth place are awarded the &quot;bronze&quot; medal.

There have been seasons with exceptions when the winners of Allsvenskan wasn&#x27;t considered Swedish champions as well. Allsvenskan winners between 1924 and 1930 were crowned league champions and awarded gold medals, the title of Swedish champions was awarded to the winner of Svenska Mästerskapet up until 1925 and then not at all until 1930. The years 1982 through 1990 are also exceptions, the title was instead decided through play-offs during these years. The same was true for the years 1991 and 1992 when the title was decided through a continuation league called Mästerskapsserien.
Historically, however, there is a big difference between the Allsvenskan winners before 1931 compared to the period between 1982 and 1992. As winning Allsvenskan in its earlier seasons was the optimal aim for the clubs, while as during the era of play-offs and Mästerskapsserien, the optimal goal wasn&#x27;t to win Allsvenskan, but the play-offs or Mästerskapsserien.

== Competition format ==
Since 2008 there are 16 clubs in Allsvenskan. During the course of a season (starting in late March and ending in early November) each club plays the others twice (home and away) for a total of 30 games. The two lowest placed teams at the end of the season are relegated to Superettan and the top two teams from Superettan are promoted in their place. The third lowest team in Allsvenskan plays a relegation/promotion play-off against the third placed team in Superettan.

The winners of Allsvenskan qualify for the UEFA Champions League, the runner-up together with the third placed team in the table qualify for the UEFA Conference League. The Svenska Cupen winner qualifies for the UEFA Europa League. In case the winner of the cup has already qualified to Champions League or Conference League, the second Conference League spot is given to the team that finishes fourth in Allsvenskan.

===Changes in competition format===
The decider at equal number of points was goal ratio until the 1940–41 season, thereafter goal difference.

== Awards ==
===Trophy===
The current trophy awarded to the Swedish champions is the Lennart Johanssons Pokal. Created in 2001, the trophy is named after former UEFA chairman, Lennart Johansson. A different trophy that was named after Clarence von Rosen, the first chairman of the Swedish Football Association, had previously been used between 1903 and 2000, but was replaced after journalists reported that von Rosen had personal connections to the later infamous Nazi leader Hermann Göring during the time he lived in Sweden (soon after World War One). The former president of the Swedish Football Association, Lars-Åke Lagrell stated that the reason for the change of trophy was not a personal attack against von Rosen but rather that the Football Association did not want to be linked to Nazism and constantly engage in discussions regarding this every time the trophy was awarded.

===Player and manager awards===
In addition to the winner&#x27;s trophy and the individual winner&#x27;s medals awarded to players, Allsvenskan also awards the most valuable player, goalkeeper of the year, defender of the year, midfielder of the year, forward of the year, newcomer of the year and manager of year at Allsvenskans stora pris together with C More and &quot;Magasinet Offside&quot;. Also, the Allsvenskan top scorer is awarded.

===Medal table===
Historically the players and coaching staff from the four best teams in Allsvenskan are awarded medals at the end of each season. The champions are awarded the gold medal while the runners-up receive the &quot;large silver&quot; medal. The third place team gets the &quot;small silver&quot; medal instead of the more commonly used bronze medal which is instead awarded to the fourth-place finisher. This tradition of awarding four medals and not three is thought to have to do with the fact that the losers of the semi-finals of Svenska Mästerskapet were both given bronze medals since no bronze match was played.

The overall medal rank is displayed below after points in descending order. 5 points are awarded for a gold medal, 3 points for a &quot;large silver&quot; medal, 2 points for a &quot;small silver&quot; medal and 1 point for a bronze medal. The table that follows is accurate as of the end of the 2024 season.


===Honoured clubs===
Clubs in European football are commonly honoured for winning multiple league titles and a representative golden star is sometimes placed above the club badge to indicate the club having won 10 league titles. In Sweden the star instead symbolizes 10 Swedish championship titles for the majority of the clubs as the league winner has not always been awarded the title of Swedish champions. Stars for Allsvenskan clubs was not common practise until 2006, although AIK had already introduced a star to their kit in 2000. IFK Göteborg, Malmö FF, IFK Norrköping, Örgryte IS and Djurgårdens IF were the first teams after AIK to introduce their stars. No new club has introduced a star since 2006, the clubs closest to their first are IF Elfsborg with 6 Swedish championship titles and Helsingborgs IF with 7 Allsvenskan titles depending on what the star symbolizes. The following table is ordered after number of stars followed by number of Swedish championship titles and then the number of Allsvenskan titles.

<text>The University of Szeged () is a public research university in Szeged, Hungary. Established as the Jesuit Academy of Kolozsvár in present-day Cluj-Napoca in 1581, the institution was re-established as a university in 1872 by Emperor Franz Joseph I. The university relocated to Szeged in 1921, making it one of the oldest research universities in Hungary. It went through numerous changes throughout the 20th century and was eventually divided into distinct independent universities.

The current University of Szeged was formed in 2000 and is made up of twelve constituent faculties and nineteen doctoral schools, which consist of a range of departments and research groups. Each faculty functions autonomously. In addition to these, the university also operates the Health Centre of the University of Szeged, an extensive teaching hospital responsible for public regional healthcare, and three laboratory schools, which combine public education and teacher training responsibilities. The faculties and associated buildings do not form one single campus, as the buildings are scattered around downtown Szeged, although the Health Centre and the buildings of the Department of Arts are adjacent to each other. Being part of the Bologna zone, most majors are divided into a Bachelor&#x27;s and Master&#x27;s and PhD programmes, but the so-called one tyre-master (undivided) programmes are also.

The university also operates the Klebelsberg Library, the largest university library in Central Europe, and six university presses. In the fiscal year of 2014, the university had an operating budget of US$220 million. The University of Szeged has educated a large number of notable alumni, including Nobel laureates Albert Szent-Györgyi and Katalin Karikó, political scientist István Bibó, and poets Attila József and Gyula Juhász. 

== History ==

=== 1581-1871: Founding and predecessors ===
The earliest predecessor of today&#x27;s university was established by Stephen Báthory in the city of Kolozsvár in 1581 as a Catholic academy, with a profile in humanities and theology. The academy offered university-level education in arts and different departments were organised by 1598. Before the establishment of a full university system, the academy stopped functioning in 1605 due to the reformation and the Long Turkish War. It was eventually re-opened with Habsburg support in 1698 as the &quot;Jesuit Academy of Cluj&quot;, and was granted the title &quot;Universitas&quot; by Maria Theresa in 1753. The university was notable for educating Saxon, Romanian and Hungarian students and the university press published books in three languages.

Following the dissolution of the Society of Jesus in 1773, the university was taken over by the Piarist teaching order, who was responsible for improving modernising education: the Faculty of Law was established in 1774, with the Faculty of Medicine following in 1775. Multiple departments made up these faculties. King Joseph II downgraded the university to a &quot;Royal College of the Academy&quot; in 1784, which hindered its further progress. Still, the institution became the largest college of Transylvania. The Faculty of Theology was closed down in 1786, and the other faculties offered a wide range of education, including economics and sciences. Following the Civic Revolution and War of Independence of 1848–1849, the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Law were closed, with the latter functioning as an independent academy starting 1863.

=== 1872-1944: University of Cluj and move to Szeged ===

The predecessor to the modern university was the University of Kolozsvár, founded in 1872 by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. The university was established as a four-faculty institution following European example: the Faculty of Arts, Languages and History, the Faculty of Law and Political Sciences, the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences, and the Faculty of Medicine were established. 269 students were enrolled in the university programmes in the first school year. The university became Ferenc József University of Cluj in 1881. Following this, the number of students grew sharply and the university had become an important centre of education at a national level. After the Reunification of Transylvania with Romania in December 1918, the University was evacuated and in 1921, after the Trianon Treaty, it started to activate in Szeged. At the time, the institution had 62 functioning departments within its four faculties. Between 1922 and 1931, the university saw a great amount of development: teaching hospitals were built along the river Tisza, and other university buildings, including the research institutes on Dóm Square and the Auditorium Maximum at the Faculty of Arts, were built. Among its teachers were Albert Szent-Györgyi, one of the founders of the Faculty of Science, who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1937 for his discoveries in connection with Vitamin C.

In 1940, the university was divided into two legally separate entities: a smaller part moved back to Cluj, while the larger part remained in Szeged, and was established as a new institution under the name Miklós Horthy University.

=== 1945-1999: Separate institutions ===
Following the Soviet occupation of Szeged in October 1944, the university acquired the name University of Szeged. During this period, entrance exams were introduced and teacher training also became an important role of the institution. With the new constitution of 1949, Russian language teaching and teaching of Marxism–Leninism was introduced. Structural changes of this period include the renaming of academic titles and ranks.

In 1951, the Faculty of Medicine was separated from the other three faculties and was established as an independent institution under the name Medical University. It later acquired the name Albert Szent-Györgyi Medical University, while the other faculties assumed the name Attila József University.

=== 2000-today: University of Szeged ===
By 1996, there had been multiple institutions offering tertiary education in Szeged. As a result, the leaders of these, including those of the Attila József University, the Albert Szent-Györgyi Medical University, the Gyula Juhász Teacher Training College, and the Franz Liszt Musical College, signed a letter of intent that the Szeged University Association be established.

On 1 January 2000, the institutes were unified as the University of Szeged. Functioning as a public university, the institution comprised ten faculties, the number of which ultimately reached 12. Since 2004, a new system in tertiary education was established, which divides most majors into a Bachelor&#x27;s and a Master&#x27;s programme.

Since 2000, numerous developments have taken place. In 2004, a new university building was opened under the name Attila József Study and Information Centre. The building contains the Klebelsberg Library, the Career Centre, the Students&#x27; Service Office, and several study spaces. In 2010, the university acquired the title research university. 2014 saw the inauguration of the ELI-ALPS Research Institute, focusing on attosecond light pulse research.

In 2021, the university senate voted in favour of an operative transformation. As a result, the university will be sustained by a state-established foundation instead of operating as a public university. The decision resulted in a nationwide controversy surrounding the model change of numerous universities in Hungary.

== Campus ==
The University of Szeged has an urban campus, meaning that the university buildings are scattered throughout the city centre without comprising a continuous university campus. Nevertheless, the Health Centre bears a close resemblance to a campus, with the teaching hospitals being in one area. The main administrative building, the Rector&#x27;s Office is on Dugonics Square, while the twelve faculties are housed in several buildings in downtown Szeged.

Important university buildings include the research institutes surrounding Dóm Square in a U-shape, and the Attila József Study and Information Centre on Ady Square. The building houses the Klebelsberg Library, the Career Centre, the Students&#x27; Service Office, and many study spaces. The university also has ten dormitories for Hungarian and international students. Other buildings and sites affiliated with the University of Szeged include the Biological Research Centre, the ELI-ALPS Research Institute and the Health Centre.
The SZTE Botanic Garden is a 24-acre garden outside the city centre and is home to more than 40 protected species whose natural habitats are only found in Hungary. Primarily a research garden, its main purpose is to maintain its rose garden, rock garden and taxonomical collection, and to organise science lessons.

== Organisation ==

=== Central governance ===
The university&#x27;s formal head is the rector, currently László Róvó. His responsibilities include maintaining in- and out-of-building relationships and making strategic decisions concerning education. Currently, there are four prorectors, responsible for strategy, education, research and development, and international relations, respectively. The chancellor is responsible for the economical management of the institution. The current chancellor is Judit Fendler. Both the chancellor and the rector are part of the Senate. Consisting of 49 decision-making delegates, the Senate make decisions on organisational changes and statutes.

Since 2000, the institute has functioned as a public university.

=== Faculties ===
Being a collegiate university, the University of Szeged is made up of twelve constituent faculties, along with a central administration. The faculties are:

Each faculty is led by the dean. The dean is appointed for five years and is responsible for overseeing education, research and human resources within the faculty, as well as maintaining a relationship with each department and the rector. The dean is also the leader of the Faculty Council, the decision-making body of each faculty. They are helped by a varying number of vice-deans. Each faculty consists of several institutes, usually organised according to broad research areas. These are responsible for educational decisions, courses, and research and development within the institute. The institutes are further divided into departments, which are on the smallest organisational level. They have immediate responsibility concerning courses, exams and research within the department. For interdisciplinary research involving multiple institutes or departments, research groups may be established.

== Academic profile ==

=== Research ===
The university has nineteen doctoral schools and several research groups. 14 research groups are supported by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, among others in areas like pharmaceutical chemistry, biotechnology and environmental technology. 700 research areas are covered at the 19 doctoral schools of Szeged. The researchers of the university have had 25,000 publications in journals and conferences. They have also had 41 patents and 52 know-hows.

=== Teaching and degrees ===
Hungarian universities adopted the Bologna objectives in 2004, and as a result, most fields of study have been divided into a Bachelor&#x27;s and a Master&#x27;s programme. Medicine, pharmacy, and dental studies, architecture, law and teacher training programmes remain single-cycle programmes called &quot;undivided programmes&quot;.

Undergraduate programmes usually last three to four years and result in a bachelor&#x27;s degree. These usually involve earning 180 or 240 credit points and the writing of a Bachelor&#x27;s thesis. Postgraduate programmes last one or two years and result in a master&#x27;s degree. In many areas, distance-learning programmes are also available. Doctorate programmes are also available as an optional study course.

=== Admission ===

Tertiary education in Hungary is non-compulsory and admission is elective. The requirements for bachelor&#x27;s degree programmes include taking the Matura exam, the general school-leaving exam in Hungary. In most programmes, there is an additional requirement of taking the exam in at least one subject at an advanced level. In some programmes, would-be students have to pass a practical examination or a test. Currently, the university has 21,000 university students, studying a total of 134 majors. Szeged offers 52 full-time degree programmes at Bachelor&#x27;s, Master&#x27;s and Doctoral level.

International students may apply for the programmes online and need to submit a form. They need to upload documents that verify their academic background, language proficiency and general health. The application process varies by faculty, and would-be students may also need to produce motivational letters or pass an online examination interview.

During the application process, would-be students receive points based on their high school performance and the results of their matura exams and may receive extra credit for outstanding performance and language certificates. Tuition is generally state-financed. Would-be students must decide whether they would like to opt for the state-financed programme, for which they need more points, or the self-financed programme. This may be changed later based on the student&#x27;s academic performance.

=== Teacher education ===

Teacher education in Hungary is carried out in a 5 or 6-year, undivided study path. Would-be teachers need to choose two majors, which may or may not be taught within one faculty. The Teacher Training Centre oversees administrative duties and coordinates teacher education between the four faculties of the university that participate in their training: the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Gyula Juhász Faculty of Education, the Faculty of Science and the Béla Bartók Faculty of Arts. Those who wish to enroll in one of the teacher training courses need to pass a general aptitude test and may need to pass practical examinations as well. 

Teacher training courses range from general courses in the would-be teacher&#x27;s two majors, as well as specific methodological, pedagogical and psychological modules. Would-be teachers need to pass one short-term and one long-term teaching practice in each of their two majors to receive a master&#x27;s degree. A 6-year programme is available for secondary school teachers and a shorter, 5-year programme is available for primary school teachers.

Teaching practices are organised in collaboration with the university&#x27;s laboratory schools. Three laboratory schools are operated by Szeged:
* SZTE István Báthory Laboratory Grammar School and Elementary School
* SZTE Gyula Juhász Elementary School
* SZTE István Vántus Vocational School of Music
These institutions function as university-affiliated state schools. Students of these schools are taught by trained teachers and student-teachers as well, and classroom observations also take place. Based on Heti Világgazdaság&#x27;s annual school report, SZTE Laboratory High School and Elementary School is Hungary&#x27;s 39th best high school and the second-best high school in Szeged based on students&#x27; competencies, language performance and university admissions.

<doc id="1096806" wikidata="Q947649" url="?curid=1096806" title="Chud">
<text>Chud or Chude (, , ) is a term historically applied in the early East Slavic annals to several Baltic Finnic peoples in the area of what is now Estonia, Karelia and Northwestern Russia. It has also been used to refer to other Finno-Ugric peoples.

==Etymology==
There are a number of hypotheses as to the origin of the term. &quot;Chud&quot; could be derived from the Slavic word &quot;tjudjo&quot; (&#x27;foreign&#x27; or &#x27;strange&#x27;), which in turn is derived from the Gothic word meaning &#x27;folk&#x27; (compare &quot;Teutonic&quot;). Another hypothesis is that the term was derived from a transformation of the Finno-Ugric name for the wood grouse. Yet another hypothesis contends that it is derived from the Sami word &quot;tshudde&quot; or &quot;čuđđe&quot;, meaning an enemy or adversary (). This, however, would have required prominent Sami presence in trading centers around Lake Ladoga.

== Attestation in Slavonic sources ==
Arguably, the earliest attested written use of the word &quot;Chuds&quot; to describe Baltic Finnic peoples (presumably early Estonians) was 1100, in the earliest Rus&#x27; chronicles in the Old East Slavic language. According to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, the Chud lived along the &quot;Varangian Sea&quot; (Baltic Sea), next to the &quot;Lyakhs&quot; (Poles) and Old Prussians. It goes on to narrate that the Chud were among the founders of the Kievan Rus&#x27; state. along with Krivichs, Veps, Ilmen Slavs and Varangians. The invading troops of Yaroslav I the Wise are said to have defeated &quot;Chuds&quot; in a battle in 1030 and then established the fort of &quot;Yuryev&quot; (in what is now Tartu, Estonia).

In other Old East Slavic chronicles, the term &quot;Chuds&quot; refers to several Finnic tribes, early Estonian groups in particular. Kievan rulers then collected tribute from the Chuds of the surrounding ancient Estonian county of Ugaunia, possibly until 1061, when, according to the chronicles, Yuryev was burned down by Estonian tribe called &quot;Sosols&quot; (probably Sackalians, Oeselians or Harionenses). Most of the raids against Chuds described in medieval East Slavic chronicles occur in present-day Estonia. The border lake between Estonia and the Russian Federation is still called &quot;Chudskoye&quot; (Chud Lake) in modern Russian. However, many ancient references to Chuds talk of peoples very far from Estonia, like &quot;Zavoloshka Chuds&quot; between Mordovians and Komis.

==Identity==
Chuds have traditionally been believed to belong to the group of Baltic-Finnic peoples, though there have been some debate as to which specific group. After the first encounter with the Chuds, Slavic people tended to call other Finnic-speaking peoples Chuds, and thus became a collective name for the Finno-Ugric neighbours in Russian cultural tradition. Many writers contend that the Chuds were Vepsians, Fasmer posits them in Karelia while Smirnov suggests the Setos are descendants of the Chuds. In recent research on toponymy of the Luga and Volkhov river catchment areas Finnish fennougrist Pauli Rahkonen has come to the conclusion, that the language spoken in the area has been Finnic only in the vicinity of the southern coasts of Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland, but more upstream of the two rivers, the language, as based on the evidence of hydronyms in the area, has represented other Finno-Ugric languages than Finnic. However, the &quot;Zavoloshka Chuds&quot; in the White Sea catchment area seem to have spoken Finnic languages based on the evidence of substrate toponymy in northern Russia carried out recently by Finnish Finno-Ugrist Janne Saarikivi.

==Chuds in folklore==
In Russian folk legends, the Chuds were described as exalted and beautiful. One characteristic of the Chuds was &#x27;white-eyed&#x27;, which means lightly colored eyes.

Russian bylinas reminisce about the destruction of the Chuds when the Slavs were occupying their territories. When a Chud township was attacked, Chud women drowned themselves, along with their jewels and children, in order to avoid robbery or rape.

In the chronicles which narrate about the founding of Russia, the Chuds are mentioned as one of the founder races, with the Slav and the Varyags (Varangians).

Folk etymology derives the word from Old East Slavic language (&quot;chuzhoi&quot;, &#x27;foreign&#x27;; or &quot;chudnoi&quot; &#x27;odd&#x27;; or &quot;chud&quot; &#x27;weird&#x27;), or alternatively from &quot;chudnyi&quot;, wonderful, miraculous, excellent, attractive.

Chuds or Tchuds are traditional generic villains in some Sami legends, as well as in the Sami-language movie &quot;Pathfinder&quot; from 1987, which is loosely based on such legends.

==Use of term in historical times==
Later, the word &quot;Chuds&quot; was more often used for more eastern Finnic peoples, Veps and Votes in particular, while some derivatives of &quot;chud&quot; like &quot;chukhna&quot; or &quot;chukhonets&quot; were applied to more western Finns and Estonians. Following the Russian conquests of Finland 1714–1809, and increasing contacts between Finns and Saint Petersburg, Finns perceived the word &quot;Chud&quot; to be disparaging and hinting at the serfdom that the Russians were believed to find fit for the Finns. However, as a disparaging word, it was rather &quot;chukhna&quot; that was applied also to Finns and Estonians as late as during the Winter War, 1939–1940, between the Soviet Union and Finland.

In present-day Russian vernacular, the word &quot;chukhna&quot; is often used to denote the Veps. The name Chuds (or Northern Chuds) has been used for Veps people also by some anthropologists.

In the mytho-poetical tradition of the Komi, the word &quot;chud&quot; can also designate Komi heroes and heathens; Old Believers; another people different from the Komi; or robbers—the latter two are the typical legends in Sámi folklore. In fact, the legends about Chuds (Čuđit) cover a large area in northern Europe from Scandinavia to the Urals, bounded by Lake Ladoga in the south, the northern and eastern districts of the Vologda province, and passing by the Kirov region, further into Komi-Permyak Okrug. It has from this area spread to Trans-Ural region through mediation of migrants from European North.

&quot;Chud&quot; has become a swear word in the Arkhangelsk region. As late as 1920, people of that region used legends of the Chuds to scare small naughty children.

<text>Polar night is a phenomenon that occurs in the northernmost and southernmost regions of Earth when the Sun remains below the horizon for more than 24 hours. This only occurs inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, polar day or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun remains above the horizon for more than 24 hours. 

There are multiple ways to define twilight, the gradual transition to and from darkness when the Sun is below the horizon. &quot;Civil&quot; twilight occurs when the Sun is between 0 and 6 degrees below the horizon. Nearby planets like Venus and bright stars like Sirius are visible during this period. &quot;Nautical&quot; twilight continues until the Sun is 12 degrees below the horizon. During nautical twilight, the horizon is visible enough for navigation. &quot;Astronomical&quot; twilight continues until the Sun has sunk 18 degrees below the horizon. Beyond 18 degrees, refracted sunlight is no longer visible. True night is defined as the period when the sun is 18 or more degrees below either horizon.

Since the atmosphere refracts sunlight, polar day is longer than polar night, and the area that experiences polar night is slightly smaller than the area that experiences polar day. The polar circles are located at latitudes between these two areas, at approximately 66.5°. While it is day in the Arctic Circle, it is night in the Antarctic Circle, and vice versa.

Any planet or moon with a sufficient axial tilt that rotates with respect to its star significantly more frequently than it orbits the star (and with no tidal locking between the two) will experience the same phenomenon (a nighttime lasting more than one rotation period).

==Description==
The length of polar night varies by latitude from 24 hours just inside the polar circles to 179 days at the poles. As there are various kinds of twilight, there also exist various kinds of polar twilight that progress towards true polar night. Each kind of polar night is defined as when it is darker than the corresponding kind of twilight. The descriptions below are based on relatively clear skies, so the sky will be darker in the presence of dense clouds.

==Types of polar night==


===Polar twilight===
As mentioned, a location experiencing polar night does not mean that the location will be in full darkness; in most cases, due to sunlight being refracted over the horizon, a location experiencing polar night will actually be in one of the various phases of polar twilight. As in locations experiencing daylight, the middle of the day will typically be the brightest time in locations experiencing polar twilight.

For example, a typical day during civil polar twilight in Vadsø, Norway will begin with night, astronomical twilight, nautical twilight, and civil twilight in that order (with each successive phase including more light than the last). Following civil twilight, the day will progress through the other phases in the opposite order (nautical twilight, then astronomical twilight, then night to end the day). 

====Civil polar twilight====
Civil polar twilight occurs at latitudes above 72°34&#x27; North or South, where the Sun will be below the horizon all day on the winter solstice, but by less than 6° at solar noon. There is then no true daylight at the solar culmination, only civil twilight. During civil polar twilight, there is still enough light for most normal outdoor activities at midday because of light scattering by the upper atmosphere and refraction. However, during dense cloud cover, places like the coast of Finnmark (about 70°) in Norway will experience a &quot;day&quot; that is darker than usual. Street lamps may therefore remain on even at midday, and a person looking at a window from within a brightly lit room might still be able to see their reflection, as the level of outdoor illuminance will be below that of many illuminated indoor spaces. 

Northern Hemisphere:

*68° North: about December 9 to January 2
*69° North: about December 1 to January 10
*70° North: about November 26 to January 16
*71° North: about November 21 to January 21
*72° North: about November 16 to January 25

Southern Hemisphere:

*68° South: about June 7 to July 3
*69° South: about May 30 to July 11
*70° South: about May 24 to July 18
*71° South: about May 19 to July 23
*72° South: about May 14 to July 27

Sufferers of seasonal affective disorder tend to seek out therapy with artificial light, as the psychological benefits of daylight require relatively high levels of ambient light (up to 10,000 lux) which are not present in any stage of twilight; thus, the midday twilights experienced anywhere inside the polar circles are still &quot;polar nights&quot; for this purpose.

====Nautical polar twilight====
Nautical polar twilight occurs at latitudes between about 72° 34&#x27; and 78° 34&#x27; North or South, which is exactly 6° to 12° inside the polar circles. There is then no civil twilight at the solar culmination, only nautical twilight. During nautical polar twilight, the human eye may distinguish general outlines of ground objects at midday but cannot participate in detailed outdoor operations. 

Civil twilight happens when the Sun is between 0 and 6° below the horizon, so this phenomenon can also be referred to as civil polar night. Nowhere on mainland Europe is this definition met. The Norwegian town of Longyearbyen, Svalbard, experiences nautical polar twilight from about 11 November until 30 January. Dikson, in Russia, experiences nautical polar twilight from about 6 December to 6 January. On the Canadian territory of Pond Inlet, Nunavut, nautical polar twilight lasts from about 16 December until 26 December.

====Astronomical polar twilight====
Astronomical polar twilight occurs at latitudes between about 78° 34&#x27; and 84° 34&#x27; North or South, which is exactly 12° to 18° inside the polar circles. There is then no nautical twilight at the solar culmination, only astronomical twilight. During astronomical polar twilight, the sky is dark enough at midday to permit astronomical observation of point sources of light such as stars, except in regions with more intense skyglow due to light pollution, moonlight, auroras, and other sources of light. There is a location at the horizon with more light than others around midday due to refraction. Some critical observations, such as of faint diffuse items such as nebulae and galaxies, may require observations beyond the limit of astronomical twilight. 

Nautical twilight happens when the Sun is between 6 and 12° degrees below the horizon, so this phenomenon can also be referred to as nautical polar night. The Norwegian town of Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, experiences this from about December 12 to 30. Its antipode () experiences this from about June 12 to July 1. The Canadian research base of Eureka, Nunavut, experiences this from about December 2 to January 8. Its antipode () experiences this from about June 1 to July 11. The Russian territory of Franz Josef Land experiences this from about November 27 to January 15. Its antipode () experiences this from about May 25 to July 17. Alert, Nunavut, the northernmost settlement in Canada and the world, experiences this from about November 19 to January 22. Its antipode () experiences this from about May 19 to July 25. Oodaaq, a gravel bank at the northern tip of Greenland and a disputed northernmost point of land, experiences this from about November 15 to January 27. Its antipode () experiences this from about May 13 to July 31.

===True polar night===
A true polar night is a period of continuous night where no astronomical twilight occurs at the solar culmination. During a true polar night, stars of the sixth magnitude, which are the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye, will be visible throughout the entire 24-hour day. At solar noon, the sun will be between exactly 18° and approximately 23° 26&#x27; below the horizon. These conditions last for about 11 weeks at the poles.

Astronomical twilight happens when the Sun is between 12 and 18° degrees below the horizon, so this phenomenon can also be referred to as astronomical polar night. True polar night is limited to latitudes above roughly 84° 34&#x27; North or South, which is exactly 18° within the polar circles, or approximately five and a half degrees from the poles. The only permanent settlement on Earth at these latitudes is the Amundsen–Scott scientific research station in Antarctica, whose winter personnel are completely isolated from mid-February to late October. The South Pole experiences this from about May 11 to August 1, while the North Pole experiences this from about November 12 to January 28.

==Polar Sun cycle==
If an observer located on either the North Pole or the South Pole were to define a &quot;day&quot; as the time from the maximal elevation of the Sun above the horizon during one period of daylight, until the maximal elevation of the Sun above the horizon of the next period of daylight, then a &quot;polar day&quot; as experienced by such an observer would be one Earth-year long.

== Effects on sleep and mental health ==
Numerous analyses have been conducted to examine the effects of polar night on humans. In Tromsø, Norway, a city located at 69 degrees north, there is a 2 month long polar night, lasting from mid-November to mid-January. An analysis was conducted based on 2015-16 data from a health survey that involved residents of the region over age 40, with the goal being to analyze the seasonal variation of sleeping patterns in Tromsø. The study found that there was a higher prevalence of insomnia among men in the fall and winter months, but not among women. However, overall, sleep duration varied little to none throughout the year despite the extreme changes in daylight; it is worthwhile to note that a factor in this result may be the significant amount of artificial light in Tromsø. 

A similar study was conducted among men who overwintered at Belgrano II, an Argentine research station in Antarctica. The station is located at 77 degrees south, resulting in a polar night 4 months in length. The study was conducted across 5 different winter campaigns in the 2010s, bringing in a total of 82 participants. The study found that participants generally slept for longer periods of time in the summer months than the winter months. Additionally, greater amounts of social jetlag were observed in the winter months. 

A third study aimed to examine the mental health of 88 Korean crew members at two different research stations in Antarctica, King Sejong Station and Jang Bogo Station. No crew members had been diagnosed with a mental illness prior to the study. While in Antarctica, 7 of the 88 crew members were diagnosed with a mental illness during early winter. The mental illnesses included insomnia disorder (3 diagnosed), depressive disorder (1 diagnosed), adjustment disorder (2 diagnosed), and alcohol use disorder (1 diagnosed). 

Overall, both Antarctic studies showed a lower amount of sleep beginning at the start of winter, while the study from the Korean bases also showed an onset of mental health problems at that time. While the study from Tromsø did not show a similar drop in sleep duration as the Antarctic studies (perhaps due to the high amounts of artificial light), it did show an increased amount of insomnia in men during winter; therefore, the polar night was shown to have sleep and/or mental health effects in all three studies.

<text>Valéry Mézague (8 December 198315 November 2014) was a Cameroonian professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Mézague was born in the 5th arrondissement of Marseille in 1983, to a Cameroonian mother. He acquired French nationality on 16 September 1997, through the collective effect of his mother&#x27;s naturalization.

He represented Cameroon at international level. His most notable moment with the &quot;Lions Indomptables&quot; was at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, where he became the starter central midfielder in the lost final against host France, after replacing the late Marc-Vivien Foé during the victorious semi final versus Colombia.

In 2003, he was involved in a serious car crash which ruled him out of the game for four months. Despite this, he fought back to reclaim his form and his performances attracted the attention of Harry Redknapp, with Mézague joining Portsmouth F.C. on loan for the 2004–05 season. However, he failed to make any sort of substantial impression and returned to France in June 2005, where he followed his former manager at Portsmouth Alain Perrin to FC Sochaux-Montbéliard.

His younger brother, Teddy, is also a footballer.

He was found dead in his apartment on 15 November 2014, due to a cardiac arrest caused by a heart disease.

<text>The Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway is a protected green belt corridor, more than wide in places, that was the former route of the proposed Cross Florida Barge Canal. It is named for the leader of the opposition to the Cross Florida Barge Canal, Marjorie Harris Carr, and was originally a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers canal project to connect the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean across Florida for barge traffic. Two sections were built, but the project was ultimately cancelled because of local opposition related to environmental concerns, including protecting the state&#x27;s water supply and conservation of the Ocklawaha River Valley ecosystem, as well as national opposition for the costs being perceived as &quot;government waste&quot; with &quot;limited national value&quot;. The greenway is part of the system of Florida State Parks, including the Santos Trail System, and is managed by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.

== History ==
The idea of a canal across the Florida peninsula was first proposed by Philip II of Spain in 1567 as a shorter and safer route for Spanish treasure ships. It was repeatedly considered over the years but found to be economically unviable. Secretary of War John C. Calhoun once again proposed a canal in 1818 as a remedy for commercial losses from shipwrecks and piracy. The Florida Railroad, finished in 1861, served a similar purpose, connecting the Atlantic Ocean at Fernandina to the Gulf of Mexico at Cedar Key.

In the 1930s, regional politicians lobbied the federal government to fund canal construction as an economic recovery program, including the creation of the Canal Authority of the State of Florida in 1933. President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized $5 million in funding for the project in 1935, and the entire project was estimated at $143 million to complete. In 1936, Michigan Senator Arthur Vandenberg challenged the canal, stating that the project never received authorization from the United States Congress. At the time, of material had already been excavated, of land cleared, and four bridge piers constructed near Ocala. Funds for construction were also exhausted, so construction stopped. Work was reauthorized by Congress in 1942 as a national defense project, and $93 million was authorized for construction. Dams and locks were used to protect the underground water supply. Support for the project from Washington was sporadic, and funds were never allocated to the Army Corps to actually start construction.

Planning was once again given the go-ahead in 1963 with support from President John F. Kennedy, who allocated one million dollars to the project. The next year, President Lyndon Johnson set off the explosives that started construction. It was intended that the canal, along with the St. Johns-Indian River Barge Canal, would provide a quicker and safer route across Florida by 1971. Opponents subsequently campaigned against the canal on environmental grounds, and a lawsuit was filed against the Army Corps by the Florida Defenders of the Environment and the Environmental Defense Fund. The lawsuit resulted in a temporary injunction against the project in January 1971, and days later was halted by President Richard Nixon&#x27;s signing of an executive order. Approximately $74 million had been spent on the project up until the 1971 cessation of activities.

The project was officially deauthorized by Congress in 1990, and the lands were turned over to the state of Florida for use as public conservation and recreation area, becoming the Cross Florida Greenway State Recreation and Conservation Area in 1991. In 1998, the land was renamed the Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway in honor of Marjorie Harris Carr, who had led the opposition to the canal with the organization she co-founded, Florida Defenders of the Environment. Carr had died the prior year at age 82.

== Canal route == 
The planned route of the canal followed the St. Johns River from the Atlantic coast to Palatka, the valley of the Ocklawaha River to the coastal divide, and the Withlacoochee River to the Gulf of Mexico. About 28% of the project was built—the cross-country section from the St. Johns River to the Ocklawaha River, part of the route along the Ocklawaha, and a small section at the Gulf of Mexico end up to the dammed Lake Rousseau.

== Economic impact ==
The canal was intended to connect the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway with the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway at Withlacoochee Bay near Yankeetown. The military and economic impact was expected to be tremendous in that it &quot;promote the national defense and to promptly facilitate and protect the transport of materials and supplies needful to the Military Establishment&quot;. The canal was intended to save travel time and distance for shipping companies by avoiding the longer route through the Florida Straits and link Florida&#x27;s inland waterways to both coasts.

== Bridges and other infrastructure ==
All the bridges over the St. Johns River north of the canal are high enough for ships or have movable sections. High bridges were built over the canal, as well as several over the Ocklawaha River where it was not widened to the canal. The following are the major roads, railroads, and locks and dams cross the path of the canal:
* Buckman Lock (formerly St. Johns Lock)
* SR 19 (high bridge)
* George Kirkpatrick Dam (formerly Rodman Dam), south of the canal on the Ocklawaha River, forming Rodman Reservoir along the canal
* Eureka Lock &amp; Dam (unfinished)
* CR 316 (high bridge)
* SR 40, Bert Dosh Memorial Bridge (high bridge)
* CR 314 (no bridge)
* SR 35 (no bridge)
* SR 464 (no bridge)
* Florida Northern Railroad (no bridge)
* CSX S-Line (no bridge)
* US 27-301-441 (SR 25/SR 500) (no bridge, but several unused supports in the median)
* CR 475 (no bridge)
* I-75 (SR 93) (no bridge; recently built land bridge over I-75 for trail users)
* SW 49th Avenue (no bridge; recently built underpass for trail users)
* CR 484 (no bridge)
* SR 200 (no bridge)
* CSX line (low bridge over the existing Withlacoochee River)
* US 41 (SR 45), Brittan Alexander Bridge (low bridge over the existing Withlacoochee River)
* Inglis Lock (Inglis Dam is south of the canal on the Withlacoochee River, forming Lake Rousseau along the canal)
* US 19-98 (SR 55), Trooper Ronald Gordon Smith Memorial Bridge (Twin bridges that replaced a much higher bridge in 2010)

Between Lake Rousseau and the Ocklawaha River, discontinuous unwatered excavations mark the canal&#x27;s planned path, along with different vegetation patterns on the land acquired for the project (as seen from the air). A lock and dam was also built south of the canal on the Ocklawaha River near CR 464C in Marion County.

== Project timeline ==
* May 1933 - Canal Authority of the State of Florida was created to construct and maintain a deep-water ship canal across Florida.
* 1935–1936 - Construction of a ship canal began under the Emergency Relief Appropriations Act of 1935, but work was suspended when Federal funds were depleted.
* July 1942 - Congress authorized construction of the Cross Florida Barge Canal.
* February 1964 - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the Cross Florida Barge Canal.
* 1969 - The Environmental Defense Fund and others filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking temporary and permanent injunction against the construction of the canal.
* January 15, 1971 - The District Court granted a preliminary injunction halting any further construction activities pending the outcome of the litigation.
* January 19, 1971 - President Richard Nixon signed an executive order suspending further work on the Barge Canal. When halted, the project was one-third complete and approximately $74 million had been spent on land acquisition and construction.
* 1979 - Bills filed in Congress to deauthorize the Canal failed to pass.
* May 22, 1990 - A revised federal bill was filed in the U.S. Senate by Senators Bob Graham and Connie Mack providing, among other things, for a minimum 300-yard wide greenway corridor to be maintained along the former Barge Canal route. This bill was agreed to by the entire Florida Congressional delegation.
* May 31, 1990 - The Florida Legislature enacted a deauthorization bill conforming to the consensus bill filed in the U.S. Senate. Most of the provisions were not effective until Congress deauthorized the project.
* October 27, 1990 - Senate Bill 2740 was passed by Congress and sent to the President for signature. The bill deauthorized the Cross Florida Barge Canal project upon acceptance by the Governor and Cabinet of the State of Florida.
* November 28, 1990 - President George Bush signed SB 2740 into law deauthorizing the Cross Florida Barge Canal project and changing the purpose of the lands to recreation and conservation.
* January 22, 1991 - The Governor and Cabinet of the State of Florida signed a resolution agreeing to the terms of the Federal deauthorization bill thereby officially deauthorizing the Cross Florida Barge Canal project. This action ultimately led to the creation of the Cross Florida Greenway State Recreation and Conservation Area.
* 1998 - The Cross Florida Greenway was officially renamed the Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway in honor of Marjorie Harris Carr, who led the fight to stop the Cross Florida Barge Canal project.

Bleek reports that the ǂKxʼaoǁʼae rendered the word as &quot;ǃXo&quot; and the Naro as &quot;ǃXu꞉ba&quot; or &quot;ǃXo꞉ba&quot; when repeating things what the Khoikhoi had told them. It has entered the Juǀʼhoan language as the name of the Christian god.

Xu, a crater on Rhea, the second largest moon of Saturn, is named for ǃXu as the supposed &quot;Bushman&quot; Creator.

<text>Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDI or, later, BSDi), was a software company founded in 1991 by members of the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG), known for developing and selling BSD/OS (originally known as BSD/386), a commercial and partially proprietary variant of the BSD Unix operating system for PCs.

== Creation and BSD/386 ==
BSDI was founded by Rick Adams and members of the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) at the University of California, Berkeley, including Keith Bostic, Kirk McKusick, Mike Karels, Bill Jolitz and Donn Seeley. Jolitz, Seeley and Trent Hein were working for Rick Adams&#x27;s UUNET at the time and became BSDI&#x27;s first employees when the company began operations in 1991. In December 1991, USENIX Secretary and Former Head of Software at Convex Computer, Rob Kolstad from University of Illinois, was hired and would take over company operations just two years later.

Jolitz, who worked on 386BSD, claimed that he was never officially hired or signed an employment contract with BSDI.

BSD/386 was released in January 1992. The name was chosen for its similarity to BSD (&quot;Berkeley Software Distribution&quot;), the source of its primary product, specifically 4.3BSD Networking Release 2 (Net/2). The full system, including source code retailed at $995, which was more affordable than the equivalent source code license for the rival UNIX System V from AT&amp;T (which cost more than $20,000 in the late 1980s.) 

== &quot;USL v. BSDI&quot; lawsuit ==

In late 1991, AT&amp;T&#x27;s Unix System Laboratories (USL) brought a lawsuit against BSDI, alleging that BSD/386 contained their proprietary trade secrets and source code. When USL were acquired by Novell, a settlement was reached in January 1994. BSDI agreed to base future releases of the product, now called BSD/OS, on the CSRG&#x27;s 4.4BSD-Lite release which was declared free of any USL intellectual property. Rob Kolstad (of the University of Illinois and Convex Computer Corporation) was president of BSDI during this period and headed the company until the close of the decade.

== Usage in infrastructure ==
Under Rob Kolstad&#x27;s direction, the company decided to pursue internet infrastructure as their primary customer audience. In the mid 1990s the top-10 websites in the world were almost all using BSD/386 as their BSD source codebase.

In the 1995 a survey of datacenter software platforms disclosed that BSDI was the #1 software used in data centers, by Internet servers. BSDI subsequently released an &quot;Internet Server&quot; version of their software, in contrast to the desktop version, which focused on providing the maximum number of open-source server products in the base distribution.

== Mergers and sale ==

In 1999, the BSDI employees sought an initial public offering and installed a new president to reach this goal as soon as possible given the recent success of the Red Hat IPO in the Linux market. Unfortunately, this strategy was not successful and soon after Rob Kolstad had exited the company, it was facing bankruptcy.

In 2000 the company merged with Walnut Creek CDROM, a distributor of freeware and open source software on CD-ROM and shortly after that acquired Telenet System Solutions, Inc., an Internet infrastructure server supplier.

In 2001, under severe financial pressure from excessive leverage, BSDI (known as BSDi by that time) sold its software business unit (comprising BSD/OS and the former Walnut Creek FreeBSD and Slackware Linux open source offerings) to Wind River Systems and renamed the remainder iXsystems with a renewed focus on server hardware. Wind River dropped sponsorship of Slackware soon afterwards and the FreeBSD unit was divested as a separate entity FreeBSD Mall, Inc. in 2002. Faced with competition from open-source BSD- and Linux-based operating systems, Wind River discontinued BSD/OS in December 2003. Many of its technologies live on in community-led BSD derivatives like FreeBSD. In 2002, OffMyServer acquired the iXsystems hardware business and reverted to the iXsystems name in 2005.

<doc id="1096829" wikidata="Q911377" url="?curid=1096829" title="Katikati">
<text>Katikati is a town in New Zealand (North Island) located on the Uretara Stream near a tidal inlet towards the northern end of Tauranga Harbour, 28 kilometres south of Waihi and 40 kilometres northwest of Tauranga. State Highway 2 passes through the town; a bypass scheduled to have begun construction in 2008 is on hold.

Katikati has become known for its many murals painted on walls of commercial buildings. These were started in the 1990s to regenerate tourist interest in the town and district, and led to the town being recognised New Zealand&#x27;s &#x27;Most Beautiful Small Town&#x27; award for towns of less than 8,000 population in 2005 by the Keep New Zealand Beautiful Society.

In 2018, Katikati was named &quot;Avocado Capital of New Zealand. Besides its avocado orchards, there are many kiwi-fruit orchards in and around Katikati.

There are hot springs three kilometres to the south of Katikati at Sapphire Springs.

==History and culture==
===Pre-European history===

Katikati was a Maori community that derived from the waka Mātaatua and is affiliated with the tribal group in Tauranga, Ngāi Te Rangi. It was later settled in 1875 by Ulster Scots people from County Tyrone in Ireland through the Orange Institution.

===European settlement===

The land upon which the town was built was taken from local Māori after the New Zealand Wars and was given to the settlers by the Central Government. The settlement was established by the Englishman George Vesey Stewart, who led two groups of mostly Irish settlers there aboard the ships &quot;Carisbrook Castle&quot; (1875) and &quot;Lady Jocelyn&quot; (1878).

The settlement was formed from two distinct groups: &quot;the settlers useful&quot; (tenant farmers) and &quot;the settlers ornamental&quot; (those with wealth). The settlement managed to withstand early economic problems and developed into a healthy town, based around farming and agriculture. In the latter 19th century, the kauri gum digging trade became an important industry in the area. Katikati was one of the southernmost areas where the gum could be found, as it is close to the historical southern limit for where kauri trees could thrive.

===Marae===

There are two marae in the Katikati area.

Te Rere a Tukahia Marae and its Tamawhariua meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāi Te Rangi hapū of Ngāi Tamawhariua.

Tuapiro Marae and its Ngā Kurī a Wharei meeting house are affiliated with the Ngāti Ranginui hapū of Ngāti Te Wai.

== Transport ==
Katikati is situated on State Highway 2. There are proposals to bypass Katikati with an upgrade including two roundabouts.

Katikati was previously on the East Coast Main Trunk railway line. The railway closed in September 1978 when the Kaimai Tunnel opened. The railway from Apata through to Paeroa remained in place until 1980. There were proposals to keep the section of railway from Apata to Katikati before it was dismantled.

<text>Lt. Col. Milo E. Rowell (July 25, 1903 – October 7, 1977) was an American lawyer and Army officer best known for his role in drafting the Constitution of Japan.

Born in Fresno, California, Rowell graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law School, and returned to Fresno in 1926 to open a private law practice there. He enlisted in the Army in 1943, where he studied occupation administration and also commanded troops in the Philippines.

Following Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945, Rowell moved to Tokyo and joined the occupation authority under Douglas MacArthur as Chief of Judicial Affairs. In this capacity, he worked with Brig. Gen. Courtney Whitney to prepare a draft constitution for the Diet of Japan to approve. Rowell extensively analyzed the existing Meiji Constitution, balancing it with the demands of Japanese lawyers to form a draft that was acceptable to both the Japanese government and the GHQ.

Rowell donated his papers to the University of Tokyo in 1965. They now serve as one of the key legislative history sources in Japanese constitutional law.

Later in life, Rowell supported establishment of a medical school in his home town of Fresno. This led to the establishment of the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine&#x27;s Fresno-Central San Joaquin Valley Medical Education Program. In 1981 the auditorium of the new Medical Education Building on the campus of Fresno&#x27;s VA Medical Center was named in Rowell&#x27;s honor.

<text>Edward Casper Stokes (December 22, 1860November 4, 1942) was an American Republican Party politician, who served as the 32nd governor of New Jersey, from 1905 to 1908.

==Biography==
Stokes was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1860. He attended the Friends School in Rhode Island, and graduated from Brown University in 1883.

Stokes was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly in 1891, and was a member of the New Jersey Senate from Cumberland County between 1893 and 1901. He was the Governor between 1905 and 1908.

Stokes made his first attempt at the United States Senate in 1902 after the death of William Joyce Sewell, but fell short in voting by the Republican caucus, losing out to John F. Dryden.

Stokes won a narrow victory in the 1910 Republican primary for United States Senate, but two years before the direct election of Senators, Democrats controlled the legislature and Stokes was defeated. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1913, but lost to James F. Fielder. From 1919 to 1927, he was the Chairman of the New Jersey Republican State Committee. Stokes ran for the U.S. Senate in 1928, but finished second in the Republican primary behind Hamilton Fish Kean. He chaired the state&#x27;s GOP general election campaign that year.

Stokes was the President of Mechanics National Bank in Trenton and was President of the New Jersey Bankers Association. He lost much of his own money in the stock market crash, and in 1939 the New Jersey Legislature voted to give him a $2,500-a-year pension. Stokes turned the money down and instead took a state job advising New Jersey&#x27;s public information office.

Stokes died November 4, 1942, aged 81. He is buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Millville, New Jersey.

<text>A companion parrot is a parrot kept as a pet that interacts abundantly with its human counterpart. Generally, most species of parrot can make excellent companions, but must be carefully managed around children and other common pet species like dogs and cats as they might be hostile towards them.
Species of parrots that are kept as companions include large parrots, such as amazons, greys, cockatoos, eclectuses, hawk-headed parrots, and macaws (including hybrids like the Catalina macaw); mid-sized birds, such as caiques, conures, Quaker parrots, cockatiels, &quot;Pionus&quot;, &quot;Poicephalus&quot;, rose-ringed parakeets, and rosellas; and many of the smaller types, including budgies, &quot;Brotogeris&quot;, parakeets, lovebirds, parrotlets and lineolated parakeets.

Some species of lories and lorikeets are kept as pets but are quite messy, and often more popular as aviary birds. Hanging parrots and fig parrots are normally kept as aviary birds and not as pets. Some species of parrots such as pygmy parrots, kākāpōs, night parrots, and about half of the species of parrotlets, are not considered companion parrots due to difficult dietary requirements or lack of availability.

The &quot;Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora&quot; (also known as CITES) has made the trapping and trade of all wild parrots illegal, because taking parrots from the wild has endangered or reduced some of the rarer or more valuable species. However, many parrot species are still common, and some abundant parrot species may still be legally killed as crop pests in their native countries.

==Maintenance==

With the right home, parrots have the potential to make excellent, highly interactive, affectionate, and entertaining pets prized by their owners, but should not be considered easy care or low-maintenance pets. Tame companion parrots require daily attention and interaction with their owners, and need to be housed in a cage at least large enough to allow the bird to spread their wings and move about comfortably. Companion parrots also need to be fed a diet that includes fresh vegetables and fruits, and a smaller amount of seeds and grains; dietary requirements vary with species and activity level.

Other elements essential to a companion parrot&#x27;s well-being include appropriate toys to chew up and play with; veterinary care; and social time out of the cage whenever possible—preferably on play gyms or other out-of-cage perches. Larger parrots can be expensive to care for, messy, destructive, and loud, and some individuals may exhibit some aggressive behaviors during adolescence. Like dogs, parrots require some amount of basic training and proper early socialization to mature into good companions. Their intelligence means parrots learn new behaviors—both good and bad—easily.

Many birds end up having to be rehomed because their owners did not adequately understand the level of care required when they purchased the bird, did not understand how loud they can be, or did not understand how to properly socialize and train their bird. This is especially true for macaws and other species with dramatic, beautiful colouring, as well as cockatoos due to their intensely affectionate demeanor. These traits unfortunately make them tempting impulse purchases, leading to hundreds of macaws and cockatoos being put up for adoption.

===Pellets and formulated diets===
In more recent years, pellets or formulated diets have become very popular, especially in the US. They offer an advantage over a seed-based diet in that a parrot cannot pick out and eat only its favorite (usually fatty) seeds. The majority of avian veterinarians will recommend a pelleted or formulated diet, and will extensively discuss with owners what their bird should and should not eat. However, although these offer an easy alternative to other foods, they are not the best for many species. Many pellets contain artificial food dyes and preservatives that may be harmful; however there are &quot;no-color-added&quot; options available on the market.

Most pellets contain soy, which is not a part of a parrot&#x27;s natural diet; however, the diet of wild parrots cannot be replicated in captivity. Avian veterinarians and nutritionists agree the pelleted and formulated diets are the best base diet for pet birds. Although pellets may be advertised as a &quot;complete diet,&quot; there are dozens of species of parrots commonly kept as pets, all with varying nutritional needs. There are still many birds which develop problems such as vitamin toxicity, fatty liver disease or gout, despite being on a pelleted diet.

A common mistake made by owners feeding pellets is over-supplementing them with fresh food. As a pellet is, essentially, a supplemented grain, supplementing them even more &quot;dilutes&quot; the diet, making the pellets less efficient and the diet unbalanced. The best diet for a bird should be determined by an avian veterinarian.

====Additional diet requirements====
While a wild diet can never be replicated, it can be used as a guide for a companion parrot’s diet. One aspect that can be mimicked is the variety of foods in the diet. Parrots in the wild spend a lot of time being active, flying and searching for food. In captivity, parrots spend much less energy daily, so the bird will need less food. Because of this, foods with a high-fat content (such as fatty seeds) should be fed sparingly, since a companion parrot does not get the amount of exercise to necessitate such a high-fat diet. Adding some variety to the parrot&#x27;s diet not only adds nutritional value but also enrichment for the mind.

====Adding fresh fruit and vegetables====
Fresh fruits and vegetables provide vitamins and minerals and are an important addition to a pelleted diet. Raw fruits and vegetables are most suitable, if thoroughly rinsed before feeding them to the parrot. Canned produce has a high-salt content and also requires rinsing before serving to the bird. Cooking the produce removes some of the nutrition. Companion parrots enjoy a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, lists of which are often found on the internet.

====Foods to limit or avoid====
Some foods (including some fruits and vegetables) are toxic to parrots and should never be fed to them. All fruit pits and seeds, any part of an avocado, chocolate, caffeine and alcohol should never be given to parrots. Other foods are not necessarily toxic, but should only be given in a limited capacity. Two examples of this are garlic and onion. Another food to be limited is dairy products. Parrots cannot digest lactose and can have digestive problems if given too much dairy. Owners are instructed to give dairy products as a treat and only sparingly. While companion parrots can enjoy many of the foods that their human caretakers eat, foods that are too high in salt, fat or sugar can cause health problems and lead to poor diet and nutrition if given to parrots too regularly.

==As pets==
Parrots can be very rewarding pets to the right owners, due to their intelligence and desire to interact with people. Many parrots are very affectionate, even cuddly with trusted people, and require a lot of attention from their owners constantly. Some species have a tendency to bond to one or two people, and dislike strangers, unless they are regularly and consistently handled by different people. Properly socialized parrots can be friendly, outgoing and confident companions.

When tame, parrots may allow and appreciate petting and cuddling from their owner; however, in certain circumstances, such as petting the back and beneath the wings (in the wild, only the bird&#x27;s mate will touch a parrot in this manner), the bird may misinterpret this physical contact as sexual behaviour. This may then lead to unwanted hormonal aggression, nesting behaviour and chronic egg laying in pet birds.

Most pet parrots take readily to trick training. Trick training can also help to redirect a bird&#x27;s energy and prevent or correct many behavior problems. Some owners successfully use well behaved parrots as therapy animals. Some owners have trained their parrots to wear parrot harnesses (most easily accomplished with young birds) so that they can be taken to enjoy themselves outdoors in a relatively safe manner without the risk of flying away. Parrots are prey animals and even the tamest pet may fly off if spooked.

Although parrots can be messy pets—often throwing food and damaging furniture with their beaks if they can—most parrots may be potty trained to some extent and are generally odorless; however, certain species of &quot;Amazona&quot; and &quot;Pionus&quot; have a distinctive odor most owners find pleasant. Most parrot species, with some notable exceptions, are relatively good pets for most pet allergy sufferers. However, all the species of white cockatoos produce large quantities of dust from their powder down feathers, which may be problematic for people with allergies. Cockatiels, rose-breasted cockatoos, and greys also produce smaller amounts of feather dust.

==Behavior==

Different species (sometimes even different individuals within species) can vary greatly in temperament, noise, and talking ability. For example, &quot;Pionus&quot; parrots generally have a reserved stance, while at the other end, large cockatoos need at least several hours of attention daily. The upbringing and genetic inclination of an individual bird plays a major role in determining its disposition, regardless of species.

Many of the larger parrots are unsuitable in an apartment setting due to noise level. Although all parrots will make some noise, species that are generally less noisy include parrotlets, budgies, cockatiels, &quot;Pyrrhura&quot; conures, &quot;Pionus&quot;, caiques, greys, and usually &quot;Poicephalus&quot;. Many of the other species of conures can be loud birds. Cockatoos, and many macaws and amazon parrots can be very loud, though normally only at certain times of the day and some birds will learn to scream for attention.

Many people are initially attracted to parrots for their ability to talk, sing, and mimic noises they are exposed to. Some parrot species such as greys, eclectus, quaker parrots, male budgies, and some species of amazon parrots, macaws, and Psittacula are frequently good talkers and mimickers, although there is no guarantee that any individual parrot will talk. Many parrots learn to use words in context; for example, calling family members by name, or requesting certain food items by name. Other species are poor talkers, but popular for their affectionate or playful personalities.

Budgies, cockatiels, lovebirds, and parrotlets have been bred in captivity the longest and are popular and readily available in many color mutations; by some definitions they are domesticated. These species make up the vast majority of individual parrots kept as pets. Although small parrots are generally much easier to care for than larger species, they are still intelligent birds who need attention and interaction. Budgies have been bred as pets for over 150 years, exist in two distinct breeds (American and English), and generally have excellent pet qualities. Many new owners are surprised at how affectionate and interactive even these small parrots can be once they are tamed.

Parrots need a cage large enough to exercise in, stretch their wings, and climb if it will not be out for a good part of the day. Without exercise, parrots tend to become obese and unhealthy.

Toys (enrichment) are necessary for pet parrots. Different birds may have very different toy preferences. Toys should be sized appropriately for the bird&#x27;s size and destructiveness; for example, a small plastic budgie toy could be dangerous for a large parrot that could break off and ingest a piece. Some birds may prefer wooden toys to chew up; some may prefer bells or other toys that make noise; some may prefer toys with leather strips they can untie; some may prefer a bowl of small &#x27;foot toys&#x27; they can throw around. Some birds may destroy their toys quickly. Although commercial bird toys can be expensive, it is possible for owners to save money by making their own toys and providing other items such as cardboard, blocks of wood, pine cones, or freshly cut branches from non-toxic trees for a parrot to chew on and play with.
Parrots use their hooked beaks to help them to climb around, as well as to shell seeds and nuts. It is normal for a parrot to use its beak to explore and to get around; it is common, for example, for a parrot to rest its beak on a person&#x27;s hand to steady itself as it steps up. Many parrots also like to gently beak or attempt to preen their owner&#x27;s hands. However, even tame parrots can bite humans, particularly if confused or frightened, so it is wise to keep larger birds caged around small children they are not familiar with. Large parrots such as macaws and cockatoos have powerful beaks they use for crushing large nuts.

It is generally not recommended to have any large parrot on the shoulder, because it is difficult to observe the parrot there for warning signs prior to a bite, and it is also easier for a parrot to slip and bite to catch itself. A large parrot bite to the face can do severe damage and destroy the trust between owner and bird. Often bites are not intentional; for example, if the bird slips from the owner&#x27;s shoulder, it is likely to try to grab the nearest thing to hold on to, which may well be an ear or part of the owner&#x27;s face.

==Household settings==

While many parrot species do well with well-behaved children, and can be excellent family pets, they are generally not a good &quot;child&#x27;s&quot; pet due to their potential lifespan and care required. Parrots require consistent daily care and attention and are also longer lived than most other companion animals. Lifespans range from around 15 years for a budgie or lovebird, to 20–30 years for a cockatiel or small conure, up to 80 to 100 years for amazons and macaws—although a more reasonable lifespan for larger parrots is estimated at 50–60 years.

Additionally, a young child could unintentionally injure a small bird such as a budgie; some parrots unaccustomed to children may find the high energy level and noise of a young child threatening and may bite. The bite strength of larger birds such as Macaws can be very dangerous and is well in excess of even a pit bull dog (375 psi compared to 275 psi). Parrots that have been raised and socialized around children from a young age typically do much better with children than parrots who are introduced to children at a later age.

Households that are suitable for pet parrots are said to be &quot;bird-safe&quot;. Parrot owners may take steps such as refraining from the use of ceiling fans, covering mirrors and electrical wiring, avoiding open flames, removing all cookware containing Teflon (which may release fumes that are toxic to parrots when heated) and restricting the use of aerosol sprays, due to the parrot&#x27;s sensitive respiratory system. To prevent their pets from suffering heavy metal toxicity, owners also ensure that their parrots are unable to chew on items such as keys and jewelry and that cages, cage equipment and parrot toys are free of zinc and lead.

==Adoption==

There is a small industry in breeding parrots for the pet trade. Breeders may range from small hobby breeders caring for just a pair or two to large breeding farms that may house hundreds of pairs. When chicks are small, breeders may put a specially made closed bird ring (bird band) on one of their legs with identifying characters stamped into the plastic. A closed ring would not fit over the foot of an adult parrot, so its presence proves that the bird was banded when a young chick.

Some breeders leave the chicks in the nest longer and thus have to use an open band on the bird&#x27;s leg. However, some breeders do not band the smaller commonly bred parrots, and some owners may have their bird&#x27;s band removed after purchase because of the possibility that a band might become caught on a toy or other object and cause injury (removal of a band should be done by a veterinarian or experienced person). Bands are the main method for identifying an individual bird, which is helpful if that bird is lost. Sometimes the larger and more expensive parrots are micro-chipped with a tiny security device, as well as being tagged with a leg ring.

Places for young parrots include breeders and specialty bird stores that ensure the chicks are healthy, well socialized with people and raised properly. Before being taken to a new home, hand-reared chicks will be fully fledged (have been allowed to learn to fly), can crack nuts and seeds for themselves, and will have been fully weaned from semisolid hand-rearing food (or fed by their parents) to an appropriate diet. Some breeders will additionally accustom their young parrots to different experiences, such as harness-training, traveling, and handling by a variety of people including children, taking advantage of this impressionable period of development.

Adult parrots that are rehomed by their owners or offered for adoption from a parrot shelter often make excellent pets after they adjust to a new home. Some of these, however, may have experienced neglect or abuse in their past, and may do best with an experienced parrot owner. The rehoming of a companion parrot, in most cases, can be avoided by doing enough research before acquiring one and determining whether the potential buyer has a lifestyle that suits the species they are considering, and choosing a bird that is most compatible with their lifestyle. Owners should also consider potential lifespan when selecting a species, and make appropriate arrangements if the bird is likely to outlive the owner.

<text>The Celestine Prophecy: An Adventure is a 1993 novel by James Redfield that discusses various psychological and spiritual ideas rooted in multiple ancient Eastern traditions and New Age spirituality. The main character undertakes a journey to find and understand a series of nine spiritual insights in an ancient manuscript in Peru. The book is a first-person narrative of the narrator&#x27;s spiritual awakening as he goes through a transitional period of his life.

== Summary ==
The book discusses various psychological and spiritual ideas that are rooted in many ancient Eastern traditions, such as how opening to new possibilities can help an individual establish a connection with the Divine. The main character undertakes a journey to find and understand a series of nine spiritual insights in an ancient manuscript in Peru. The book is a first-person narrative of spiritual awakening. The narrator is in a transitional period of his life and begins to notice instances of synchronicity, which is the belief that coincidences have a meaning personal to those who experience them.

The story opens with the male narrator becoming reacquainted with an old female friend, who tells him about the insights contained in a manuscript dating to 600 BC, which has been only recently translated. After this encounter leaves him curious, he decides to go to Peru. On the airplane, he meets a historian who also happens to be interested in the manuscript.

The historian explains how the world is currently undergoing an enormous shift in consciousness, elaborating on how things had been generally understood (until now) to be: 1) In the beginning, people believed the world to be governed by the forces of divinity; everything could be explained as an act of a god or gods, 2) With increasing knowledge of the world, brought about by scientific inquiry, people turned to the men and women of science for an explanation of life and their world, and 3) Since the problem of how to find meaning in the world could not be solved by science, people chose to instead focus on efforts to improve their lives materially, subduing and plundering the earth for its natural resources, with a hyper-emphasis on controlling economic conditions and market fluctuations. What was now occurring, explained the historian, was that the baseness of our current conditions had begun to infect our souls as well. We had become restless and desperate, primed for another fundamental shift in consciousness so as to bring about the creation of a new, better world.

He also discovers that powerful figures within the Peruvian government and the Catholic Church are opposed to the dissemination of the material found in the manuscript. This is dramatically illustrated when the police try to arrest and then shoot the historian after his arrival. Threats to his life forced the narrator to live nomadically, moving from town to town in search of kind-hearted people who would offer lodging in exchange for more information about the manuscript and its message.

While evading the Church and Peruvian government, the narrator finds time to read from the prized manuscript that offers &#x27;Insights&#x27; as a sequence of passages. During pursuit, the narrator experiences real-world lessons that prepare him for each Insight in advance. In the end, he returns to the United States after learning the first nine Insights, and promises to reveal a &#x27;Tenth Insight&#x27; to his audience in a short time. 
&#x27;Insights&#x27; as such, are never made explicit to the reader, but are instead paraphrased through action; made into a sequence of parables that drive the storyline. Sourcing transcription is made impossible by the narrator, claiming, &quot;it must be the way it is for sake of brevity&quot;; adding that even a partial translation of the Ninth &#x27;Insight&#x27; is a lengthy twenty pages, typewritten.

In the novel, the Celestine Temple in the ruins of an ancient civilization in Peru was where the manuscript was buried. After it was found, the Incas re-habituated the abandoned cities. At some point, the ancients reached an &quot;energy vibration level&quot; threshold that allowed them to cross over into a reality of pure spirituality.

==Influences==
Redfield has acknowledged the work of Dr. Eric Berne, the developer of transactional analysis, and his 1964 bestseller &quot;Games People Play&quot;, as major influences on his work.

==Publishing history, adaptations and sequels==
Redfield originally self-published &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot;, selling 100,000 copies out of the trunk of his car before Warner Books agreed to publish it.

Christopher Franke, former member of Tangerine Dream, adapted the book into a music album in 1996.

As of May 2005, the book had sold over 5 million copies worldwide, with translations into 34 languages.

A film adaptation was released in 2006.

Redfield expanded the book&#x27;s concept into a series, which he completed in three sequels:

* &quot;The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision&quot; (1996)
* &quot;The Secret of Shambhala: In Search of the Eleventh Insight&quot; (1999)
* &quot;The Twelfth Insight: The Hour of Decision&quot; (2011)

== Reception and critique ==
The book was generally well received by readers and spent 165 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; has also received some criticism, mostly from the literary community, who point out that the plot of the story is not well developed and serves only as a delivery tool for the author&#x27;s ideas about spirituality. James Redfield has admitted that, even though he considers the book to be a novel, his intention was to write a parable, a story meant to illustrate a point or teach a lesson.

<text>James Redfield is an American writer, lecturer, screenwriter, and film producer. He is notable for his 1993 novel &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot;.

==Biography==
Redfield grew up in a rural area near Birmingham, Alabama. He studied Eastern philosophies, including Taoism and Zen, while majoring in sociology at Auburn University. He later received a master&#x27;s degree in counseling and spent more than 15 years as a therapist to abused adolescents. During this time, he was drawn into the human potential movement and turned to it for theories about intuitions and psychic phenomena that would help his clients.

In 1989, he quit his job as a therapist to write full-time, synthesizing his interest in interactive psychology, Eastern and Western philosophies, science, futurism, ecology, history, and mysticism.

When Redfield self-published &quot;The Celestine Prophecy,&quot; his first novel, in 1992, the interest from booksellers and readers led to its becoming one of the most financially successful self-published books of all time. Warner Books bought the rights and published the hard cover edition in March 1994. The book quickly climbed to the No. 1 position on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. According to &quot;Publishing Trends,&quot; &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; was the No. 1 international bestseller of 1996 (#2 in 1995). The novel spent over 3 years on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. As of May 2005, &quot;The Celestine Prophecy&quot; had sold over 20 million copies worldwide and had been translated into 34 languages. In 1996, the sequel, &quot;The Tenth Insight: Holding the Vision&quot; (Warner Books), also became a bestseller. The two books spent a combined 74 weeks on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, making their author the best-selling hard cover author in the world in 1996, as cited in BP Report (January 1997).

In his non-fiction title, &quot;The Celestine Vision: Living the New Spiritual Awareness&quot; (Warner Books, 1997), Redfield explored the background of the &quot;emerging spirituality&quot; discussed in his novels. The Celestine series of adventure parables continued in 1999 with the publication of &quot;The Secret of Shambhala: In Search of the Eleventh Insight&quot; (Warner Books). In 2002, Redfield joined author Michael Murphy and filmmaker Sylvia Timbers in a collaborative non-fiction work entitled &quot;God and the Evolving Universe&quot; (J.P. Tarcher).

The novel was the basis for a 2006 film of the same name. Redfield produced, co-writing the screenplay with Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon.

James and Salle Redfield are the founders of the Global Prayer Project, a bi-weekly webcast which offers guided prayer and meditation.

Redfield&#x27;s newest offering, &quot;The Twelfth Insight: The Hour of Decision&quot;, was published by Grand Central Publishing in February 2011.

==Awards==
In October 1997, Redfield was awarded the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Senate at the XXIII Pio Manzu International Conference in Rimini, Italy. In the spring of 2000, Redfield joined Millard Fuller, founder of Habitat For Humanity, as the two recipients of Humanitarian of the Year honors from their alma mater, Auburn University. Two months later, he received another Humanitarian of the Year award from the International New Thought Alliance.

<text>The Sea Ferret was a submarine-launched aerial reconnaissance drone under development by the United States Navy, designed to be launched from within a Sub-Harpoon missile canister and controlled by a submerged submarine to provide covert surveillance, weapons targeting, choke point interdiction, and battle damage assessment.

While its primary mission was reconnaissance, Sea Ferret was a weapon, carrying a nine-kilogram (20 lb) warhead, capable of destroying smaller targets like command centers and surface-to-air missile launchers.

Sea Ferret was under development by Northrop Grumman Corporation since 1991, and was successfully demonstrated onboard &quot;Asheville&quot; (SSN-758).

<text>USS &quot;Asheville&quot; (SSN-758), is a nuclear powered fast attack submarine. She is the fourth vessel of the United States Navy to be named for Asheville, North Carolina. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia on 26 November 1984 and her keel was laid down on 9 January 1987. She was launched on 24 February 1990, sponsored by Mrs. Dorothy Helms, and commissioned on 28 September 1991.

&quot;Asheville&quot; was fitted with a developmental Advanced Mine Detection System (AMDS) high-frequency active sonar array with transmitters and receivers in the sail and in a disc-shaped chin sonar dome beneath the hull at the bow. The system is used for target detection, mine avoidance, and bottom navigation. After a highly successful testing period the system was removed during overhaul in 2003.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
===1990s===
In December 1996, &quot;Asheville&quot; served as a trials platform for the Northrop Grumman Sea Ferret reconnaissance drone. After &quot;Asheville&quot; simulated an underwater launch, a Cessna 206 test aircraft flew over the area of operations with the Sea Ferret attached to its underside. Technicians aboard &quot;Asheville&quot; transmitted commands to the Sea Ferret, which were received and responded to by the Cessna pilot. Control of the drone was then passed back and forth among the &quot;Asheville&quot; team, USMC First Force RECON, and a United States Army Aviation team, with all three teams continuing to receive a continuous flow of sensor data.

In August 1998 &quot;Asheville&quot; returned from a six-month Western Pacific Deployment (WESTPAC). After a 30-day stand down, she entered an extended maintenance period at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard remaining there until the beginning 1999. Almost immediately after the maintenance period &quot;Asheville&quot; began a work-up for another six-month deployment to the Western Pacific. This work-up included various underway periods, for weekly operations.

At the end of May 1999, &quot;Asheville&quot; conducted two family day cruises. The first left Pearl Harbor and steamed to Lahaina, Maui. &quot;Asheville&quot; anchored a mile off the Maui coast for five days. She returned to Pearl Harbor, at the end of the week, with the second group of family members aboard.

In July 1999, she deployed to the Eastern Pacific (EASTPAC) for two months, continuing work-ups with the Carrier Strike Group (CSG). During this deployment, she visited San Diego, CA, Esquimalt and Victoria, British Columbia, and Ketchikan, Alaska. While conducting sound testing off the coast of Ketchikan, &quot;Asheville&quot; was suspended at a depth of 400 feet, and held in position by four mooring buoys above. During this 36-hour period, the crew made phone calls with a line rigged though an electrical fitting. After the testing, the boat surfaced. Some of the crew members swam in the 50-degree waters of Behm Canal.

&quot;Asheville&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor, at the end of August, 1999 and conducted a six-week upkeep period. At the end of October 1999, she returned to San Diego for three weeks where she completed final work-ups with the &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; CSG, including staged attacks on the ship. &quot;Asheville&quot; was the only ship in the Carrier Group that was not successfully boarded or attacked. Another part of this final work up included Naval Special Warfare, off the coast of California, when &quot;Asheville&quot; launched a BGM-109 Tomahawk Cruise Missile. After the launch, an F-14 Tomcat pilot took control of the missile. The missile flew to Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, California, hitting the target perfectly. &quot;Asheville&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor at the end of November, 1999. She completed a six-week upkeep period, and made final preparations for her forthcoming deployment.

===2000s===

On 11 January 2000, &quot;Asheville&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for a six-month WESTPAC Deployment. She was part of the &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; CSG. This Group included the carrier &quot;John C. Stennis&quot;, guided missile cruisers and , destroyer , guided missile destroyer , amphibious warfare ships and , guided missile frigate , fast combat support ship , and sister submarine . &quot;Asheville&quot; arrived in Yokosuka, Japan on 27 January 2000, in time for the crew to watch Super Bowl XXXIV. She departed Yokosuka, on 3 February, and arrived in Hong Kong on 8 February, sailing into Victoria Harbour along with the entire &quot;John C. Stennis&quot; Carrier Group. She was tied up alongside &quot;Lake Champlain&quot; for electric power. &quot;Asheville&quot; left Hong Kong on 12 February, and arrived in Singapore, on 17 February. On 21 February, she departed Singapore, and arrived in Manama, Bahrain on 7 March 2000. During this time &quot;Asheville&quot; completed a mission vital to National Security, the details of which remain classified. She left Bahrain that night after loading stores and became the first submarine to participate in Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO). On 18 March 2000 &quot;Asheville&quot; arrived in the free port of Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates. On 23 March, she left Jebel Ali and returned to Manama, Bahrain on 28 March.

&quot;Asheville&quot; departed Bahrain on 3 April to head back to the Pacific, turning over Carrier Group responsibilities to &quot;Jefferson City&quot;. Prior to leaving the area, &quot;Asheville&quot; completed a second, National Security mission. While in transit to a port call in Australia, the crew received word that three sailors from the command ship had assaulted a taxi driver in Cebu, Philippines. In an effort to smooth tensions with the Philippine Government, &quot;Asheville&quot; was directed to make way for Subic Bay, Philippines. Prior to pulling into Subic Bay, the captain took &quot;Asheville&quot; to a location a few miles south of the Equator for crew members to become Shellbacks. The next day while steaming north, &quot;Asheville&quot; stopped off the coast of Borneo where the captain allowed a swim call. On 28 April 2000, &quot;Asheville&quot; pulled into Subic Bay, and became the second U.S. Navy submarine to port in Subic Bay Freeport in four years. While there, &quot;Asheville&quot; sailors assisted in renovating a school, and conducted a VIP tour and cruise for top members of the Philippine government. The day was cut short due to a suspected coup attempt, with the emergence of Abu Sayyaf. &quot;Asheville&quot; returned to port, returning the VIP&#x27;s and taking on crew members previously left ashore.

&quot;Asheville&quot; departed Subic Bay on 3 May, returning to Yokosuka, Japan, on 8 May to complete an upkeep period. On 15 May, she departed Yokosuka, Japan to complete a third, National Security mission. On 15 June 2000, &quot;Asheville&quot; arrived in Sasebo, Japan, and tied up alongside the submarine tender for weapons exchange. After an eight-day stay in Sasebo, she departed for home on 22 June. On the way home, &quot;Asheville&quot; conducted an Operational Reactor Safeguard Examination (ORSE). The ORSE team was brought on board 1 July. After a night of successful &quot;Drilling and Spilling&quot;, the ORSE Board gave &quot;Asheville&quot; a high score. She returned to Pearl Harbor in time for Fourth of July celebrations, to the sound of the submarine and surface ship whistles, on 2 July. During this deployment, &quot;Asheville&quot; reported to; COMSUBRON III, COMSUBGRU 7, CTF-74, CTF-54, as well as the Commander of Carrier Strike Group Seven.

On 1 April 2005 &quot;Asheville&quot; returned to San Diego, California, after a six-month deployment to the Western Pacific. While deployed she performed National Security Missions, and took part in two international exercises. During the deployment, she made port calls at Guam, Singapore, Japan, Saipan, and Hawaii. On 1 August 2006, &quot;Asheville&quot; departed San Diego to return to the Western Pacific, for another six-month Deployment.
While deployed, she made port calls at Yokosuka, Japan, Hong Kong, Saipan, &amp; Guam. She returned to her home port of San Diego, California, on 3 February 2007. On 27 April 2007, &quot;Asheville&quot; entered Floating Dry Dock , at Naval Base Point Loma, for a scheduled maintenance period. On 16 August 2007 she, exited &quot;Arco&quot;, having completed her upkeep. In 2009 &quot;Asheville&quot; completed pre-deployment preparations and returned to the Western Pacific.

===2010s===
She deployed from 3 February until 3 August 2010, and made multiple port calls in Guam and Sasebo. Having completed a Western Pacific deployment, she commenced preparations for further operations by returning to the floating drydock, &quot;Arco&quot;. This maintenance period prepared her for a Southern Command area of responsibility deployment. She was deployed from mid-August to 16 December 2011, twice visiting Panama City, Panama.

<doc id="1096860" wikidata="Q1363409" url="?curid=1096860" title="Loch Tay">
<text>Loch Tay () is a freshwater loch in the central highlands of Scotland, in the Perth and Kinross and Stirling council areas, the largest body of fresh water in Perth and Kinross. The watershed of Loch Tay traditionally formed the historic province of Breadalbane.

It is a long, narrow loch about long, and typically around wide, following the line of the strath from the south-west to north-east. It is the sixth-largest loch in Scotland by area and more deep at its deepest.

== Pre-history and archaeology ==
Between 1996 and 2005, a large-scale project was carried out to investigate the heritage and archaeology of Loch Tay, the Ben Lawers Historic Landscape (BLHL) Project. It took place primarily on the National Trust for Scotland’s property but included some local landowners who held the agricultural lands between the head-dyke and the loch-shore.

=== Mesolithic period ===
Before 1996 the earliest known evidence for occupation along the shores of Loch Tay had been a nearby stone-axe factory at Creag an Caillich and the 1965 excavations of the stone circle at Croft Moraig (dated to the 3rd to 2nd millennium BC). However, the BLHL project found a lithic scatter along the Ben Lawers Nature Trail that dated to the 8th and 7th millennia BC, during Scotland&#x27;s Mesolithic period. This and another Mesolithic site found during the project were very important to archaeologists understanding of that time period in Scotland. Until the 1990s most Mesolithic sites were recorded along the coasts and these sites were the first ones recorded in the uplands of the Highlands, demonstrating that the hunter and gathers of that time did not strictly live by the coasts.

=== Neolithic and Bronze Ages ===
The BLHL project also found evidence of people living and working in the hills above the loch during the Neolithic period. A Beaker burial was also found, the Balnahanaid Beaker, which may be among the earliest Beakers in Scotland, dating to a time when their use was rare.

==== Prehistoric environment and loch levels ====
Investigations of the loch have found that a Neolithic woodland existed on its edge for at least 900 years and that during that period the shoreline would have been least 4–5m lower than it is today.

=== Iron Age ===
Several of the 20 crannogs found along Loch Tay have been radiocarbon dated to the Iron Age:

* Morenish Crannog 50 BC – AD  220 
* Morenish Boathouse Crannog 750 BC – AD 30
* Milton Morenish Crannog 810 – 390 BC
* Eilean Breaban Crannog AD 420–640 &amp; 600–400 BC (two occupations) 
* Tombreck Crannog 170BC–AD180

As well as round houses that were excavated at Croftvellich and Tombreck which the archeologists took to indicate that that settlements may have been much more densely concentrated during the Iron Age than was previously thought, with people living both on the land and on the water.

=== Early historic ===
The loch appears to have been at the edge of Pictland. An Early Christian graveyard at Balnahanaid was found, as well as some upland occupation sites. Furthermore, there is evidence that Eilean Breaban, Dall North and Craggan Crannogs were occupied during this period, but overall Loch Tay was not a major centre of Pictish activity.

=== Medieval ===
In the early medieval period people began to cultivate the higher elevations of the hills around the loch. The Macnabs, the Menzies, the Drummonds, the Napiers, the Haldanes, the MacGregors and the Robertsons of Carwhin and Strowan all owned land around the loch but little remains of their possible castles/manors. Most of the surviving lordly residences are associated with the Glenorchy Campbells, who grew in power and influence during the 15th and early 16th centuries, specifically those at Lawers, Carwhin and Edramucky.

=== Post-medieval and modern ===

The Campbells held most of the land in the area from around the 1600s to the late 1800s, when they began to sell off the land. Though before doing so they undertook clearances of the residents. It is estimated that two-thirds of the population was removed from around the loch. The National Trust for Scotland would buy a significant amount of the land in the 1950s to become the largest landowner in the area.

From 1882 to 1939 the Loch Tay Steamboat Company and then the Caledonian Steam Packet Company provided a passenger and cargo service on the loch with 5 steamers.

== Scottish Crannog Centre ==
More than 20 crannogs have been identified in Loch Tay. The Scottish Crannog Centre is an open-air museum on the south of Loch Tay and has a reconstructed crannog, built between 1994 and 1997. The recreated Iron Age roundhouse was destroyed by fire in 2021. The museum is raising money for its repair.

== Geography ==
Ben Lawers, on the north shore of the loch is, at , the tenth-highest mountain in the British Isles, and is the highest peak in a group of seven munros.
Killin at the head of the loch, and Kenmore at the outflow of the River Tay, are the main settlements on the lochside today. The smaller settlements of Acharn, Ardeonaig and Ardtalnaig are located on the south side of the loch whilst Fearnan and Lawers are on the north side. The loch is fed by the rivers Dochart and Lochay at its head and numerous smaller streams.

== Railway ==

Loch Tay railway station was on the Killin Railway. It is now closed.

== In popular culture ==

Media outlets reported in June 2024 that the loch had been temporarily renamed to &quot;Loch Tay Tay&quot; as a tribute to the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift touring in Scotland as part of the Eras Tour.

The loch is a popular spot for salmon fishing, and many of its surroundings feature in the traditional Scottish &#x27;Loch Tay Boat Song&#x27; (Scottish Gaelic, &quot;Iorram Loch Tatha&quot;). This is a very sad song in which the protagonist muses on unrequited love for a red-haired woman (a &quot;Nighean ruadh&quot;) whilst rowing at the end of a working day. It has been recorded by Liam Clancy and The Corries amongst others. The film Monty Python and the Holy Grail filmed the famous scene with the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog at Tomnadashan Mine on the east bank of the loch.

<text>The bombing of Rabaul in November 1943 was an air attack conducted by the Allies of World War II upon a cruiser force at the major Japanese base of Rabaul. In response to the Allied invasion of Bougainville, the Japanese had brought a strong cruiser force down to Rabaul from Truk, their major naval base in the Caroline Islands about 800 miles north of Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against the Allied supply and support shipping. Allied carrier- and land-based planes attacked the Japanese ships, airfields, and port facilities on the island of New Britain to protect the Allied amphibious invasion of Bougainville. As a result of the Rabaul raids, the Japanese naval forces could no longer threaten the landings. The success of the raid began to change the strongly held belief that carrier-based air forces could not challenge land-based air forces.

==Background==
In early 1943, Rabaul had been distant from the fighting. However, the Allied grand strategy in the South West Pacific Area—Operation Cartwheel—aimed to isolate Rabaul and reduce it by air raids. Japanese ground forces were already retreating in New Guinea and in the Solomon Islands, abandoning Guadalcanal, Kolombangara, New Georgia and Vella Lavella.

Rabaul—on the island of New Britain—was one of two major ports in the Australian Territory of New Guinea. It was the main Japanese naval base for the Solomon Islands campaign and New Guinea campaign. Simpson Harbour—captured from Australian forces in February 1942—was known as &quot;the Pearl Harbor of the South Pacific&quot; and was well defended by 367 anti-aircraft guns and five airfields.

Lakunai and Vunakanau airfields were pre-war Australian strips. Lakunai had an all-weather runway of sand and volcanic ash, and Vunakanau was surfaced with concrete. Rapopo— to the southeast—became operational in December 1942 with concrete runways and extensive support and maintenance facilities. Tobera—completed in August 1943 halfway between Vunakanau and Rapopo—also had concrete strips. The four airfields had 166 protected revetments for bombers and 265 for fighters, with additional unprotected dispersal parking areas. A fifth airfield protecting Rabaul was Borpop airfield, completed in December 1942 across the St. Georges Channel on New Ireland.

The anti-aircraft defenses were well coordinated by army and naval units. Naval guns guarded Simpson Harbor and its shipping and the three airfields of Tobera, Lakunai, and Vunakanau. The army units defended Rapopo airfield, supply dumps and army installations; and assisted the navy in defending Simpson Harbor. An effective early warning radar system provided coverage from Rabaul, and extended coverage with additional radars were on New Britain, New Ireland, and at Buka. These sets provided from 30 to 60 minutes&#x27; early warning of an attack.

=== Land-based air campaign ===
As a part of Operation Cartwheel, in the fall of 1943 the U.S. Fifth Air Force, the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, all under the command of General George Kenney, began a sustained bombing campaign against the airfields and port of Rabaul. The initial mission was delivered by 349 aircraft on 12 October 1943, but it could not be followed up immediately because of bad weather. A single raid by 50 B-25 Mitchell medium bombers reached the target on 18 October. Sustained attacks resumed on 23 October, culminating in a large raid on 2 November.

In the 2 November mission, nine squadrons of B-25s, 72 bombers in total, and six squadrons of P-38 Lightning totaling 80 fighter escorts attacked Simpson Harbor and its anti-aircraft defenses with bombing attacks and minimum altitude strafing runs. Eight B-25s were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery or Japanese naval fighters. Nine of the P-38s were also lost. Among the lost was Major Raymond H. Wilkins of the 3rd Attack Group, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

=== Japanese attacks on Bougainville ===
Admiral William Halsey was implementing the next phase of his advance up the Solomon chain and looked to establish a base on Bougainville. On Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields at the southern tip of the island, one at the northernmost peninsula, and a fourth on Buka just across the northern passage. Instead of attempting a costly assault on these heavily defended areas, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines at Empress Augusta Bay, about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville. There he would have his Seabees clear and build an airfield of their own.

On the night of 1/2 November the screening naval unit succeeded in defending the landing (the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay), but Admiral Mineichi Koga responded quickly. Within a few days the local cruiser force had been augmented with reinforcements from Truk. The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but in the face of the imminent threat to Rabaul they committed substantial resources in hopes of crushing the newly landed force and its naval support. The force refueled at Rabaul in preparation for the coming battle.

Halsey lacked comparable surface forces to oppose this fresh challenge. His main surface strength, two battleships and a number of cruisers, had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa. The only forces at hand were the carrier airgroups of and . These would have been considered a potent force for a battle at sea, but Rabaul was a heavily fortified port with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries. Navy aviators had termed it &quot;a hornet&#x27;s nest&quot;. With the exception of the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no attack against such a formidable land target had been attempted by carrier aircraft. As such it was considered a highly dangerous mission for the aircrews and also placed the carriers at risk. Halsey later said the threat that the Japanese cruiser force at Rabaul posed to his landings at Bougainville was &quot;the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac (Commander of the South Pacific Area).&quot;

== Attacks on Rabaul ==
With the fate of the landing in the balance, Halsey ordered his carriers, under command of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman, to steam north through the night of 4/5 November to get within range of Rabaul for a daybreak raid on the base. Approaching behind the cover of a weather front, Sherman launched all 97 of his available aircraft against the target, leaving no aircraft behind for combat air patrol over his ships. The aircrews were ordered to damage as many warships as possible, rather than attempting to achieve a sinking. Aircraft from airfields on Barakoma and the recently captured Vella Lavella were sent out to sea to rendezvous with the carrier force to provide it with some measure of protection.

The daybreak Navy air bombing of Rabaul was followed up an hour later with an Army Air Force raid by 27 B-24 Liberator heavy bombers of the Fifth Air Force, escorted by 58 P-38s. By the end of the attacks, six of the seven Japanese cruisers at Rabaul had been damaged, four of them heavily. suffered near misses by three bombs that caused severe damage and killed 22 crewmen, including her captain. was hit by one bomb above one of her engine rooms, causing heavy damage and killing 70 crewmen. was hit by one 500 lb bomb and set afire, causing heavy damage and killing 19 crewmen. was hit by two 500 lb bombs, causing heavy damage and killing 23 crewmen. was slightly damaged by several near-misses. One bomb struck near , which damaged an anti-aircraft gun and killed one crewman. Three destroyers were also lightly damaged.

The strike had been a stunning success, effectively neutralizing Koga&#x27;s cruisers as a threat to the Bougainville mission. Under the threat of additional airstrikes, most of the Japanese warships departed for Truk the next day, practically ending Japanese naval presence in the area. Losses among the attacking aircraft were light.

Two days later an additional carrier unit, Task Group 50.3 of the U.S. 5th Fleet, reached Halsey, arriving on 7 November. These ships were among the first wave of newly built U.S. Navy warships and had only recently become operational. Commanded by Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery, the task group consisted of the fleet carriers and and the light carrier . Halsey used Montgomery&#x27;s ships as well as Task Force 38 (TF 38) in a combined strike against Rabaul on 11 November. Sherman launched his strike from near Green Island, northwest of Bougainville, which attacked in bad weather at about 08:30. After its return, TF 38 retired to the south without being detected. Montgomery launched from the Solomon Sea southeast of Rabaul.

== Aftermath ==
&quot;Agano&quot;—which had remained at Rabaul after the 5 November strike—was torpedoed and heavily damaged in these attacks. The destroyer reportedly suffered a direct bomb hit while loading torpedoes near the mouth of Rabaul Harbor. She blew up and sank, killing 148 of her crew. In the wake of the raids the Japanese launched a series of counterattacks involving 120 aircraft against the U.S. carriers, but the force was intercepted and lost 35 planes without inflicting damage on Montgomery&#x27;s ships. 

The raids succeeded in protecting the Allies&#x27; recent gains, leaving Rabaul as an increasingly isolated outpost, difficult to supply and posing little danger to accelerating Allied operations in the region. The capture of Bougainville and Buka brought Rabaul into range of land-based US Navy and Marine Corps tactical bombers for the first time, setting the stage for the pacification campaign intended to neutralize Rabaul that began on 17 December 1943.

<text>Edwin Warren Hatch (4 September 1835 Derby, England – 10 November 1889 Oxford, England) was an English theologian. He is best known as the author of the book &quot;Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages Upon the Christian Church&quot;, which was based on his 1888 Hibbert Lectures and which were edited and published following his death. He is also remembered as the composer of the hymn &quot;Breathe on Me, Breath of God.&quot;

==Biography==
He was born in Derby, the son of Samuel Hatch, a grocer and accountant, and his wife Charlotte Mooney; Walter Mooney Hatch was his brother. He attended King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham, where he studied under James Prince Lee; he was noted for his intellectual independence and study habits. He joined the Church of England, baptised in 1852, having been raised a nonconformist, under the influence of John Cale Miller, rector of St Martin in the Bull Ring.

Hatch matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford in 1853, where he was a dominant figure in the Birmingham Set. He graduated B.A. in 1857, and M.A. in 1867.

In 1858, Hatch won the Ellerton Prize. That year, he was ordained deacon, and worked in London&#x27;s East End. In 1859, he was ordained as an Anglican priest. He moved to Toronto, Canada West, where he was professor of classics at Trinity College until 1862. Between then and his return to Oxford, England, in 1867, he served as rector of the High School of Quebec and professor of Classics at Morrin College, both in Quebec City. He was vice-principal of St Mary Hall from 1867 until 1885. In 1884 he was appointed university reader in ecclesiastical history.

Hatch was a Bampton lecturer in 1880. He served as a Grinfield lecturer from 1880 to 1884, during which time he presented his concordance on the Septuagint.

In 1873, Hatch edited &quot;The student&#x27;s handbook to the University and colleges of Oxford&quot;, which appeared in several revised editions during and after his time at the university. He wrote a small number of hymns, collected in the posthumous &quot;Towards Fields of Light&quot; . One that is noted is &quot;Breathe on me, Breath of God&quot;. It appeared in the &quot;Congregational Psalmist Hymnal&quot; (1886) edited by Henry Allon. &quot;I dared not hope that thou wouldst deign&quot; was included in Garrett Horder&#x27;s &quot;Hymns: Supplemental to Existing Collections&quot; (1894).

==Family==
Hatch and his wife Evelyn had four children: Arthur Herbert Hatch (b. 1864), Beatrice Hatch (b. 1866), Ethel Hatch (b. 1869), and Evelyn Hatch (b. 1871).

<text>Lawrence Lucchino (September 6, 1945 – April 2, 2024) was an American lawyer and Major League Baseball executive. He served as president of the Baltimore Orioles, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the San Diego Padres, and president and CEO of the Boston Red Sox. He was also chairman of the Worcester Red Sox, the Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox; chairman of The Jimmy Fund, the philanthropic arm of the Dana–Farber Cancer Institute; and president and CEO emeritus of Fenway Sports Group, the parent company of the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool F.C. Lucchino played college basketball for the Princeton Tigers.

==Early life and education==
Lawrence Lucchino was born on September 6, 1945, in Pittsburgh. He graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School, and attended Princeton University, where he played college basketball. He was a member of the Princeton Tigers men&#x27;s basketball team for the 1964–65, 1965–66, and 1966–67 seasons. The 1964–65 Tigers, captained by Bill Bradley, advanced to the Final Four of the 1965 NCAA University Division basketball tournament.

Lucchino graduated from Princeton in 1967. He earned a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School, where he was a classmate of Hillary Clinton.

==Career==
After law school, Lucchino practiced law with the Washington, D. C., law firm of Williams &amp; Connolly. The founder, famed litigator Edward Bennett Williams, had ownership interest in both the Washington Redskins and the Baltimore Orioles. Lucchino&#x27;s law practice at Williams &amp; Connolly included a substantial amount of work for those two sports teams. Through that work, Lucchino served on the Redskins&#x27; board of directors from 1979 to 1985.

Lucchino became president of the Baltimore Orioles, serving from 1988 to 1993, and president and CEO of the San Diego Padres, serving from 1995 to 2001. Lucchino subsequently joined the Boston Red Sox as president and CEO when John W. Henry purchased the team in December 2001. Lucchino was known for having initiated the trend of building baseball-only facilities with an old-fashioned charm and smaller seating capacities. Under his watch, both the Orioles and Padres built new stadiums, pioneering Oriole Park at Camden Yards and Petco Park, respectively.

He helped build Padres teams that made the playoffs in 1996 and 1998. They advanced to the 1998 World Series, which was instrumental in winning a city-wide vote in November 1998 to authorize the construction of Petco Park. Lucchino was named to the Padres Hall of Fame in 2022.

===Boston Red Sox (2002–2021)===
Lucchino brought future general manager Theo Epstein with him to the Red Sox from the Orioles and the Padres, having also encouraged Epstein to attend law school while he was working at the Padres.

Following the 2002 season, Pedro Martinez called Lucchino asking him to sign David Ortiz, who had been released by the Twins. Lucchino &quot;always enjoyed a strong connection with Big Papi throughout his entire career&quot;. Lucchino hired Janet Marie Smith to initiate a nearly $300 million renovation project of Fenway Park over the next ten years, including the Green Monster seats.

Lucchino is credited with coining the term &quot;Evil Empire&quot; for the New York Yankees.

On August 1, 2015, the Red Sox announced that Lucchino was stepping down after the 2015 season. He retired on October 5, 2015, and became president/CEO emeritus of Fenway Sports Group. Lucchino continued as chairman and co-owner of the Pawtucket, Rhode Island–based Pawtucket Red Sox. He was a key figure in the relocation of the franchise to Worcester, Massachusetts, becoming the Worcester Red Sox for the 2021 minor league season. Lucchino served as that team&#x27;s first chairman.

==Personal life==
Lucchino previously served on the board of directors for Special Olympics. He was a commencement speaker at several colleges in the New England area, including Boston University (2008), New England School of Law (2008), Bryant University (2009), and Anna Maria College (2010). He was awarded several honorary degrees, including from Boston University, Suffolk University, and Palomar College.

He was the only person known to have World Series rings (Orioles, 1983; Red Sox 2004, 2007, 2013 and 2018), a Super Bowl ring (Redskins, 1982) and a Final Four watch (Princeton, 1965). He was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2016, and into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 2022. He was also inducted into the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame, the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame, and the Taylor Allderdice High School Hall of Fame. He was named chairman of The Jimmy Fund in 2016.

Lucchino was a non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivor, undergoing radiation treatment in 1986 after his diagnosis in September 1985. In October 1999, he had surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital to remove localized prostate cancer. In December 2019, he underwent surgery at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston to remove a cancerous blockage in the kidney area. In August 2023, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute presented Lucchino with the Boston Red Sox Jimmy Fund Award for his help in raising $142 million over the years.

He was married to Stacey Johnson, and he adopted her two children, Davis and Blair.

===Death===
On April 2, 2024, Lucchino died from heart failure at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, at the age of 78. In August 2024, Red Sox principal owner John W. Henry commented:

Larry was the greatest baseball man I ever met. Usually when you call someone a baseball man, you are talking about his knowledge of the game on the field. In Larry’s case, baseball off the field was greater. He was unequivocally a Hall of Famer. The greatest baseball man.

<doc id="1096881" wikidata="Q1473131" url="?curid=1096881" title="Leksands IF">
<text>Leksands Idrottsförening is a Swedish professional ice hockey team from the town of Leksand in the region of Dalarna. The team plays in the top-tier league, Swedish Hockey League (SHL), after succeeding through the 2019 SHL qualifiers and thus earning promotion to the SHL. The club&#x27;s home arena is Tegera Arena, which seats 7,650 spectators.

== History ==

The club was formed on 13 August 1919, originally playing bandy and ski competitions. In 1920 they also took up football.

The first hockey game was played in 1938, when they beat Mora IK 11–0, and this sport is now the only sport the club competes in. Despite the fact that the town of Leksand only has 6,000 inhabitants, Leksands IF is one of the most popular teams in Sweden, and the team averages over 4,000 spectators per game in their home arena despite playing in the second tier. Leksand played in the top hockey division in Sweden from 1951 until 2001. The club was very successful between 1969 and 1975, when they became Swedish champions four times (1969, 1973–1975). Before the current top division, Elitserien (now known as the SHL), was formed prior to the 1975–76 season, they had been the runners-up four times: 1959, 1964, 1971 and 1972. Leksand has never become SHL champions despite winning the SHL&#x27;s regular season in 1980, 1994 and 1997, and being the runners-up in 1989. In 2001, they were the club with the second most consecutive seasons in the highest division at that point (the record is held by Södertälje SK, with 53 consecutive seasons between 1925 and 1978).

Following the relegation to HockeyAllsvenskan in April 2001, Leksand commuted between the top and second divisions until 2005–06, when the team was relegated to the second tier again, where they would find themselves until the 2012–13 season.

For the 2007–08 season, Leksand signed former NHL goaltender Ed Belfour in an attempt to regain top league status. After winning the second league with relative ease, the team failed in the final qualification stage, Kvalserien, to gain promotion. Ed Belfour retired after the 2007–08 season.

Leksand once again won Allsvenskan in the 2008–09 season, but once again failed to qualify for the Elitserien in the 2009 Kvalserien. The managers Thomas Kempe and Thomas Jonsson were sacked following three straight defeats in the beginning of the Kvalserien. The team finished the 2009 Kvalserien with five wins in the last six games, but still failed to qualify. For the 2009–10 season, Leksand employed Leif Strömberg, who had previously successfully guided Södertälje SK through Kvalserien. The team once again won Allsvenskan and qualified for the 2010 Kvalserien, finishing three points ahead of AIK. In the ninth round of the 2010 Kvalserien, Leksand had a good chance to put them in the driver&#x27;s seat for promotion to Elitserien, but Leksand failed to beat the Kvalserien&#x27;s worst ranked team Växjö Lakers and, despite a win in the tenth and final round, Leksand missed Elitserien as both AIK and Rögle BK won their respective games in the final round.

After failing promotion, Leif Strömberg was replaced by ex-Leksand forward Niklas Eriksson, under whom the following season Leksand attempted to reach the Kvalserien for the seventh consecutive season. The team finished fourth in Allsvenskan and missed automatic qualification for the Kvalserien and had to play in a pre-qualification series to reach the Kvalserien, but Leksand finished third and missed the Kvalserien. Before the 2011/12 season, assistant head coach Christer Olsson took over the reins, but was sacked following a defeat at Sundsvall Hockey in late November and replaced by Andreas Appelgren.

After winning the regular season in the 2012–13 season, Leksand once again qualified for play in Kvalserien. In the 2013 Kvalserien, Leksand finally promoted back to the Swedish Hockey League (SHL; formerly Elitserien), the top-tier league, for the first time since the 2005–06 season.

<doc id="1096887" wikidata="Q689114" url="?curid=1096887" title="Digimon Adventure (1999 TV series)">
<text>, also known as Digimon: Digital Monsters Season 1 in English-speaking territories, is a 1999 Japanese anime television series produced by Toei Animation in cooperation with WiZ, Bandai and Fuji Television. It is the first anime series in the &quot;Digimon&quot; media franchise, based on the Digital Monster virtual pet released in 1997.

&quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; began production 1.5 months after the film of the same name was being produced, and it began broadcast in Japan a day after the film&#x27;s theatrical release on March 7, 1999, airing until its conclusion on March 26, 2000. It was then followed up with the 2000 film &quot;Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!&quot;. Both films were adapted and released in North America as &quot;&quot; on October 6, 2000.

With the success of &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot;, a sequel television series, &quot;Digimon Adventure 02&quot;, was broadcast from 2000 to 2001. For the series&#x27; 15th anniversary, a six-part film series titled &quot;Digimon Adventure tri.&quot; was released between 2015 and 2018, and a final film titled &quot;Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna&quot; was released in 2020. In 2020, the series was reboot and released under the title &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot;.

== Plot ==

On August 1, 1999, seven children are transported into the Digital World by Digivices that appeared before them at summer camp, where they befriend several Digimon (Digital Monsters). The kids&#x27; Digivices allow their partner Digimon to Digivolve into stronger forms and combat enemies. As the kids explore to find a way home, they learn that they are &quot;DigiDestined&quot;, children chosen to save the Digital World. During their adventure, the DigiDestined are hunted by Devimon, who uses black gears to corrupt various Digimon into attacking the group. After defeating Devimon, the DigiDestined are contacted by Gennai and instructed to reach the Server Continent to retrieve artifacts called Crests, allowing their Digimon partners to Digivolve into their Ultimate forms. During this time, they are targeted by Etemon.

After Etemon is defeated, the DigiDestined learn from Gennai that there is an eighth DigiDestined child, who Myotismon is entering the real world to kill. The DigiDestined follow after Myotismon to the real world. After discovering that the eighth child is Tai&#x27;s younger sister, Kari, and that Myotismon’s lieutenant Gatomon is her Digimon partner, the DigiDestined are able to defeat Myotismon. However, the boundaries between the real world and Digital World are intersecting, forcing them to return to the Digital World.

The DigiDestined face the Dark Masters, a quartet of mega-level Digimon who each took control of a part of the Digital World in their absence. In the midst of their battles, they learn that they were chosen to save the real and Digital Worlds from intersecting four years ago. Tension leads to infighting within the group and causes them to temporarily separate. After reflecting, the DigiDestined reunite to defeat the last Dark Master, and confront Apocalymon who attempts to destroy both worlds. Apocalymon destroys their Crests, but the DigiDestined realize the power of their Crests was inside them all along and manage to defeat him. With the Digital World restored, Tai and his friends leave their Digimon partners behind and return to their normal lives.

== Development ==
In 1999, a short film based on the virtual pets called &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; was released. However, shortly after the film&#x27;s storyboard was completed in 1998, producers at Toei Animation were requested to turn it into a television series.

The DigiDestined&#x27;s character designs were created by Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru. The character names are based on kanji related to luck.

== Media ==
=== Anime ===

&quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; was produced by Toei Animation and ran for 54 episodes on Fuji TV between March 7, 1999, and March 26, 2000. The main opening theme for all episodes aired in Japan is &quot;Butter-Fly&quot; by Kōji Wada, which peaked at #47 on the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart. &quot;I Wish&quot; by AiM is used as the ending theme from episodes 1–26, while &quot;Keep On&quot;, AiM&#x27;s fifth single, served as the ending theme from episodes 27–54. The series also uses three insert songs: &quot;Brave Heart&quot; by Ayumi Miyazaki as the Digivolution theme, &quot;Seven&quot; by Kōji Wada, and by Toshiko Fujita, Tai&#x27;s voice actress. On August 1, 2014, during the series&#x27; 15th anniversary, a Blu-ray Disc box of the original series was announced and set for release in Japan on March 15, 2015.

Saban Entertainment licensed the series in North America and produced an English-language version under the title &quot;Digimon: Digital Monsters&quot;, premiered on Fox Kids Network on August 14, 1999. The series was also broadcast in Canada on YTV. The English version featured an original soundtrack and made changes to character names, as well as edits pertaining to certain aspects such as violence to make the series more suitable for younger audiences. Wendee Lee, Michael Sorich and David Walsh became the voice directors. The original soundtrack of the show was replaced by music composed by Udi Harpaz and Shuki Levy, which recycled several music soundtracks from &quot;&quot;, &quot;Masked Rider&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot;. The opening theme for all episodes is &quot;Digimon Theme&quot; by Paul Gordon. &quot;Hey Digimon&quot; by Gordon, an insert song featured in the show, and was released on the of &quot;&quot; along with &quot;Digimon Theme&quot;.

The English dub version, &quot;Digimon: Digital Monsters Season 1&quot;, was released on December 27, 2022, while the original Japanese version, &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot;, was released on July 25, 2023.

=== Films ===
Several short films based on the series were released in theaters in Japan. &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; was originally released on March 6, 1999. The story focuses on Tai and Kari finding a Digi-egg from their computer, which hatches and quickly Digivolves, culminating in a battle. The film grossed ¥650 million.

&quot;Digimon Adventure: Our War Game!&quot; was originally released on March 4, 2000. In the film, the DigiDestined find a virus Digimon who Digivolves into who infects the Internet. The film introduces DNA Digivolution. The film grossed ¥2.166 billion. &quot;Our War Game!&quot; later served as the inspiration for director Mamoru Hosoda&#x27;s film &quot;Summer Wars&quot;.

The two short films were combined with &quot;Digimon Adventure 02: Part 1: Digimon Hurricane Landing!! / Part 2: Supreme Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals&quot; and was released as &quot;&quot; in North America on October 6, 2000. &quot;Digimon: The Movie&quot; was altered from the original script to remove &quot;culturally awkward&quot; Japanese elements and introduced jokes suitable for a North American audience. Originally, scriptwriter Jeff Nimoy wanted to combine &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot; and &quot;Our War Game!&quot; while releasing &quot;Digimon Hurricane Landing / Supreme Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals&quot; as a direct-to-television movie, but the idea was overruled. In order to connect the film&#x27;s stories, the script was rewritten.

, a stereoscopic 3D short film, was shown at Toei Animation Festival on October 3, 2009 and was later included on a set of DVD works released on February 21, 2010.

=== Video games ===

Characters and Digimon from &quot;Adventure&quot; appear throughout many video games based on the franchise, such as &quot;Digimon Rumble Arena&quot;.

An RPG based on the original storyline of &quot;Adventure&quot; developed by Prope and published by Namco Bandai Games, also title &quot;Digimon Adventure&quot;, was released for the PlayStation Portable on January 17, 2013, part of the line-up of video games of the 15th-anniversary celebration of the franchise. The game covers the entire series as well as the second Japanese film, &quot;Bokura no War Game&quot;, and sees the return of all the main voice actors. The game also features original story elements and an unlockable dungeon mode featuring sequel protagonists in the franchise.

=== Other media ===
Other media adaptions include a manhua released in 2000 and its sequel. A North American 12 issue adaption of the first arc of the show was published by Dark Horse Comics. A novelization was written by the Digimon Adventure screenwriter, Hiro Masaki and series director Hiroyuki Kakudō. The light novels were separated into three parts. Four Drama CDs were also released between 1999 and 2003.

== Reception ==

On its initial release, the series found a rather large success in the United States. When it was first released in North America, the series was seen as an attempt to imitate the success of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine named &quot;Digimon&quot; as the &quot;Worst &quot;Pokémon&quot;/Net Crossbreeding Attempt&quot; in 2000. However, audiences eventually noticed that compared to &quot;Pokémon&quot;, the characters interacted and developed realistically, as well as the integration of more complicated science fiction stories and societal themes. The English dub gradually improved as well, making fewer and fewer alterations to the Japanese original by later episodes. As a result, many young viewers quickly outgrew &quot;Pokémon&quot; and migrated to &quot;Digimon&quot; instead.

Despite the criticism, it placed first at the start of the May 2000 Nielsen ratings sweeps, surpassing &quot;Pokémon: Adventures on the Orange Islands&quot; among viewers aged 2–11 and 6–11. Retailers and businesses such as snack food company Jel Sert and toy store chain Toys &quot;R&quot; Us capitalized on the popularity of the series by licensing it for promotion with their own products. Web search engine Lycos listed &quot;Digimon&quot; as the number five fad of 2000, and it ranked 35th on the list of the year&#x27;s top searches.

On Anime News Network, Luke Carroll gave the &quot;Digimon: Digital Monsters - Collection 2&quot; DVD an overall grade of D+.

<text>Vincent de Paul Péricard (born 3 October 1982) is a former professional footballer who played as a forward in France with Saint-Étienne and in Italy with Juventus before moving to England, where he played for several clubs. Born in Cameroon, he played for the France U21 team.

==Early life==
Péricard was born in Efok, Cameroon, but moved to France aged 4. He holds citizenship of both countries.

==Club career==

===Saint-Étienne and Juventus===
Péricard started his career at Saint-Étienne in France at the age of six. In 1999, he advanced to the first team and played two league matches.

He soon came to the attention of Italian Serie A club Juventus, who signed him in 2000. Promised by the media to a bright future, Julien Courbet made a documentary on Péricard entitled &quot;the man who will be worth billions&quot;. Péricard made only one appearance for the club in two seasons, as a 61st-minute substitute for Tomás Guzmán in a UEFA Champions League match against Arsenal on 20 March 2002.

===Portsmouth===
Despite only making one appearance for Juventus, he attracted the attention of Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp.

Péricard initially moved to Portsmouth on loan for the 2002–03 season. Péricard began his Portsmouth career in superb fashion, scoring on his debut in a 2–0 win over Nottingham Forest, although he struggled with injury in the latter half of the season. Despite this, he impressed enough to earn a permanent switch in July 2003, having scored nine times in 32 games as they won the First Division title.

Péricard was a regular in the squad at the start of the 2003–04 season, but broke down with a torn thigh muscle in late September. He returned to the first team in December, but then badly damaged a cruciate ligament in a reserve comeback game. The injury ended his season. He had an operation on the injury in France in the summer of 2004, and spent the whole of the 2004–05 season in rehabilitation following the surgery. In August 2005, following his recovery, he attended a Cameroon national team training camp for a friendly match against French amateur team Villemomble.

In 2005–06 Péricard returned to the first-team squad at Fratton Park. In order to gain match fitness he spent a three-month loan spell with Sheffield United, scoring twice against Millwall and Luton, before joining Plymouth Argyle in a loan deal in February 2006 for the remainder of the season. He scored his first English League hat-trick for Plymouth Argyle in a 3–1 win over Coventry City on 18 February 2006. He was recalled to Portsmouth in May 2006.

===Stoke City===
Péricard was released by Portsmouth at the end of the 2005–06 season, signing a three-year contract with Stoke City on a free transfer on 19 June 2006. Péricard was Tony Pulis&#x27; first signing as manager of Stoke City, in Pulis&#x27; second spell at the club. At first, Péricard impressed at Stoke, scoring against eventual promotion winners Derby County on his home début. He also scored in the League Cup against Darlington, and again in the league against Sunderland. However, his performances later in the season were relatively poor and his place was taken by another former Portsmouth player, Ricardo Fuller.

On 24 August 2007, Péricard was sentenced to four months in prison after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice. This came after he lied about being the driver of a car caught speeding at 103 mph near Plymouth. He was released from prison on 20 September 2007 but, following problems with his electronic tag, he was rearrested on 12 October 2007, although he was subsequently re-released later that month. On 14 March 2008, Southampton confirmed the loan signing of Péricard until the end of the season. Upon his return to Stoke, he scored against Reading in a League Cup tie in September 2008.

Péricard made his first Premier League appearance in 0–0 draw with Fulham on 13 December 2008, coming on as a substitute for Danny Pugh. His first start in the Premier League came against Blackburn Rovers. Péricard, after seeing his first team opportunities disappear at Stoke following their promotion to the Premier League, signed a 93-day loan on 20 February 2009 with Millwall. Following the 2008–09 season, Péricard was released from his contract at Stoke.

===Carlisle United===
Following his release, he had short trials with Championship sides Bristol City, Cardiff City and Blackpool. On 13 October 2009 Péricard signed for Carlisle United on a contract until January 2010, making his debut on 17 October against Yeovil Town. Pericard scored his first goal for the Cumbrians on his home debut against Southend United. On 24 November 2009, Péricard scored twice in a 4–3 thrilling goal against MK Dons.

The next game on 28 November 2009 against Norwich City, Péricard scored the first goal in the match in a 3–1 win. On 12 December 2009, Péricard scored the only goal in the game in a 1–0 win over Wycombe Wanderers and before the match, Péricard required an injection in his Achilles tendon before scoring the winner. His goalscoring performance and helping the club turn from relegation candidates to play-off contenders led manager Greg Abbott keen to extend Péricard&#x27;s stay until the end of the season, with a number of clubs interested in giving him a chance to play at a higher level once again. In Response, Péricard is happy to sign a contract extension at Carlisle which end on 12 January. However, Péricard rejected a new contract at Carlisle and left the club.

===Swindon Town===
On 14 January 2010, Swindon Town signed Péricard on a free transfer until June 2011 after the forward had rejected a new deal from Carlisle United where Péricard has decided opted to try his luck elsewhere. He made his debut two days later in a 3–1 win over Gillingham, coming on in the 68th minute for Charlie Austin. He made a forceful run into the penalty area and was bundled to the floor gaining a penalty, which Billy Paynter scored.

Péricard scored his first goal for Swindon in the Football League Trophy match against Southampton on 31 August 2010, hitting a 30th minute volley into the back of the net, followed by his second goal in injury time to make it 3–0 and also received a booking. On 18 September 2010, Péricard scored the first goal for Swindon which turned out to be a winning goal in a 2–1 win over Walsall. Scoring three goals in the last four games, Péricard believes he is finally winning over the boo-boys feels his performances have started to silence his critics. he told the Swindon Advertiser &quot;I thought the fans were quite harsh to me but Saturday was the first time they have really appreciated what I have done and hopefully now they are going to be behind me and give me even more belief and confidence to play better, I think everyone can see I&#x27;m growing in confidence and hopefully some people are starting to see that they were wrong about me.&quot; On 11 October 2010, Péricard scored the first goal for Swindon which again turned out to be a winning goal in a 2–1 win over Bristol Rovers. On 6 November 2010, Péricard scored his last professional career goal in a 4–0 win over Plymouth Argyle in the First Round of the FA Cup. On 15 January 2011, Péricard made his last professional appearance for Swindon in a 1–0 loss against Yeovil Town before been sidelined with a knee injury for the past four weeks and upon his recovering, Péricard play his part in Swindon&#x27;s survival scrap as he nears his return to fitness. However, Péricard hadn&#x27;t featured for the rest of the season.

Following Swindon Town&#x27;s relegation to League Two, Péricard (along with Jakub Jesionkowski) were both released by the club on a free transfer as their contracts expired on 30 June 2011.

===Non-League===
After his release from Swindon, Péricard trained with AFC Bournemouth in a bid to revive his career but could not earn a contract. He then signed for Conference South side Havant &amp; Waterlooville, but retired from football in February 2012. In January 2015 he came out of retirement to play for Wessex League club Moneyfields, making his debut on 27 January in a 1–0 win over Folland Sports, which put Moneyfields top of the league.

==Personal life==
Péricard set up his own company, Elite Welfare Management, which aims to help &quot;foreign players adapt to their new climate and prevent them from suffering stress, loneliness and depression&quot;. He is also involved with Kick It Out, and is a student at Portsmouth University on a business studies course.

<text>Crossens is the northernmost district of the town of Southport, Merseyside, England.

Historically part of the ancient parish of North Meols and entirely in Lancashire, most of Crossens was transferred to Merseyside on 1 April 1974, when local government boundaries were reorganised nationally. Part of northern Crossens, known as Fiddlers Ferry, is in West Lancashire. Formerly, the village was a detached settlement lying on the western edge of Martin Mere, but after the drainage of the Mere and the expansion of Southport, it had become absorbed into the town&#x27;s conurbation.

==History==
Formerly &quot;Crossenes&quot; or &quot;Crosnes&quot;, meaning a “ness” or headland with a cross. The cross was possibly a guide for shipping or people crossing the Ribble Estuary from Freckleton (near Lytham). A hospice or lodging house was sited in Crossens where travellers could rest after making the crossing. It is also believed to be the point at which 2,000 horsemen from a retreating Royalist force crossed the Ribble estuary following the Battle of Marston Moor. They later joined the Siege of Lathom House.

Sited as it was on the shore of Martin Mere and at the seaward end of Crossens Sluice, Crossens formed the basis of a substantial fishing industry supporting the surrounding area and the nearby village of Banks. After Martin Mere was largely reclaimed for farmland, the focus of the town increasingly turned to agriculture, and to this day the high-quality soil supports several flower and vegetable farms in the east of the district. Farming of some scale or other has been a feature of this area since medieval times. However, the Industrial Revolution led to Crossens&#x27; incorporation into Southport as a site for housing for the larger town&#x27;s burgeoning worker population. The first half of the 20th century saw the area becoming home to some light industry (including the Vulcan motor works), but apart from some small industrial units the area is now primarily a commuter suburb for Southport, Preston and Ormskirk.

==Criffel granite boulder==
The Criffel Stone is a large boulder that lies at the side of Banks Road, Crossens. It is made of Criffel granite; a type of rock that is only normally found in Dumfries, Scotland. It was found in the ground when the pumping station on Banks Road was being built in 1959.

Geologists found that the rock was deposited in the area during the last ice age (18,000 years ago) by ice. Rocks like this that have been transported in this way are called erratics.

==Shops and Businesses==

Within the village of Crossens, there are a number of local businesses. This includes takeaway restaurants, bars, newsagents, and shops centred around Rufford Road. In 2024, the village welcomed ‘The Woollen Pig’ which is a bar offering a range of alcoholic drinks, soft drinks, jacket potatoes, and snacks - the latter available for guests and their dogs. This added to other local venues such as ‘The Beer Den’, and ‘Sea Palace’.

==Transport==
Crossens lay on the route of the West Lancashire Railway from Southport to Preston; Crossens railway station, opened in 1878, was the last station within the Southport boundary. In April 1904 it became the final electrified station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway&#x27;s suburban lines radiating from Liverpool. The electric trains shared the line from Southport with steam trains continuing to Preston. The line and station closed on 7 September 1964.

Being the northernmost part of Southport, Crossens is the terminus of several bus routes - Arriva North West services 44, 47 and 49 terminate at the Plough Hotel roundabout, still known as such even though the Plough Hotel was demolished c.2015. Other bus services passing through Crossens include Stagecoach Merseyside and South Lancashire services 2, X2 and 347. In addition, there is also the Cumfybus service 40, which terminates on Harrogate Way.

Between 15 July and 26 July 1904, &quot;Denver&quot; visited Galveston, Texas, where she was presented a gift of silver service from the people of Denver. She cruised in the Caribbean, investigating disturbances in Haiti, then returned to Philadelphia on 1 October. During the next two and a half years, she cruised the Atlantic Coast and in the Caribbean, joining in target practice and other exercises, and protecting American interests from political disturbance in the West Indies. On 13 September 1906, a landing force consisting of six officers and 124 bluejackets and marines, under the command of Lt. Comdr. M. L. Miller was landed from &quot;Denver&quot; at Havana, Cuba. This landing force returned on board on 14 September 1906. Crewmembers serving on &quot;Denver&quot; between 12 September and 2 October 1906 qualified for award of the Cuban Pacification Medal.

===1906 ceremonies===
Non-campaign highlights of this period of her service included her participation at Annapolis between 19 April and 27 April 1906 in the interment ceremonies for John Paul Jones at the United States Naval Academy; a midshipman training cruise to Madeira and the Azores in the summer of 1906; and the Fleet Review off Oyster Bay, Long Island, by President Theodore Roosevelt in September 1906.

===Asiatic fleet===
The cruiser sailed from Tompkinsville, New York, on 18 May 1907 for duty with the Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines, sailing through the Mediterranean and Suez Canal to Cavite, where she arrived on 1 August. &quot;Denver&quot; visited ports in China, Manchuria, and Japan, and joined in the regular exercise schedule of the fleet until 1 January 1910, when she cleared Cavite for Mare Island Naval Shipyard. Arriving there on 15 February, she was placed out of commission on 12 March; she was then placed in reserve commission on 4 January 1912, and placed in full commission on 15 July 1912 for service in the Pacific.

===Pacific fleet===
On 19 July 1912, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Beekman Winthrop announced that on 30 July, &quot;Denver&quot; would depart Mare Island bound for the west coast of Mexico and its principal ports including Mazatlan and Acapulco before returning to Mare Island in what he termed &quot;a friendly call.&quot; However, because of worsening political turmoil in Nicaragua that threatened American lives and property there, &quot;Denver&quot; was instead ordered to proceed from Santa Cruz, California to Mare Island to replenish stores for a trip to San Diego, where she was due 10 August, and after that, on to Central America. At San Diego, &quot;Denver&#x27;s&quot; departure was delayed until 13 August due to engine repairs.

===Nicaragua 1912===
&quot;Denver&#x27;s&quot; arrival at Nicaragua was further delayed when she stopped on 17 August, to render assistance and attempted to tow off and later, refloat a merchant ship, S.S. &quot;Pleiades&quot; that had run aground off the coast of Mexico that day. &quot;Denver&quot; and her crew remained until 21 August; however, their efforts to dislodge the ship were unsuccessful. With the crew and passengers of &quot;Pleiades&quot; out of danger, &quot;Denver&quot; continued south to Nicaragua.

For the next five years, &quot;Denver&quot; cruised the West Coast from San Francisco to the Panama Canal Zone, patrolling the coasts of Nicaragua and Mexico to investigate and prevent threats to the lives and property of Americans during political disturbances, carrying stores and mail, evacuating refugees, and continuing the schedule of exercises which kept her ready for action. Crew members serving on &quot;Denver&quot; between 29 July and 14 November 1912 qualified for award of the First Nicaraguan Campaign Medal.

During the First Nicaraguan Campaign, &quot;Denver&quot; embarked multiple landing parties, the largest, a 120-man landing force under the command of Lieutenant Allen B. Reed landed at Corinto, Nicaragua, for duty ashore between 27 August and 26 October 1912 to secure the railway line running from Corinto to Managua and then south to Granada on the north shore of Lake Nicaragua. One officer and 24 men were landed from &quot;Denver&quot; at San Juan del Sur on the southern end of the Nicaraguan isthmus from 30 August to 6 September 1912, and from 11 to 27 September 1912 to protect the cable station, custom house and American interests. &quot;Denver&quot; remained at San Juan del Sur to relay wireless messages from the other navy ships to and from Washington until departing on 30 September, for patrol duty.

&quot;Denver&quot; departed Corinto on 26 October 1912 to return to Mare Island with stops at Mexican ports on her way back to California. She was at Manzanillo, Mexico on 1 November and San Diego on 9 December where she remained through 20 December, conducting gunnery practice before returning to Mare Island. In early 1913, &quot;Denver&quot; made an uneventful -month cruise in Mexican waters, during which time she made stops at Acapulco, Acajutla, San Salvador and Corinto, before arriving at San Diego on 3 May 1913.

From 1913 to early 1917, Denver continued to regularly operate off the Mexican Coast during the ongoing insurrection in Mexico. Crew members serving on &quot;Denver&quot; on any of the following dates: 7–8 July 1914; 13–24 August 1914; 4 April–29 June 1916; 15 July–14 September 1916 or 16 December 1916 – 7 February 1917 qualified for award of the Mexican Service Medal.

&quot;Denver&quot; reported at New York on 22 July 1917 for duty escorting merchant convoys out of New York and Norfolk, Virginia, to a mid-ocean meeting point where destroyers took over the task of convoying men and troops to ports in England and France. Before the close of World War I, &quot;Denver&quot; made eight such voyages. Crewmembers serving on &quot;Denver&quot; between 22 August 1917 and 3 November 1918 qualified for the World War I Victory Medal with &quot;Escort clasp&quot;.

Following the Armistice, &quot;Denver&quot; was detached on 5 December 1918 to patrol the east coast of South America, returning to New York on 4 June 1919. Between 7 July 1919 and 27 September 1921, she voyaged from New York to San Francisco, serving in the Panama Canal Zone and on the coasts of Central America both outward and homeward bound.

In the summer of 1922, &quot;Denver&quot; carried Charles D. B. King, the President of Liberia, home to Monrovia from a visit in the United States, returning to Boston by way of the Canal Zone.

<doc id="1096913" wikidata="Q5178687" url="?curid=1096913" title="Courtney Whitney">
<text>Major General Courtney Whitney (May 20, 1897 – March 21, 1969) was a lawyer and United States Army commander during World War II who later served as a senior official during the American occupation of Japan (1945–1951). He played a major role in the liberalization of Japanese government, society, and economy during the occupation.

==Early life==
Born in Washington, D.C., Whitney enlisted in the United States Army in 1917 and became a pursuit pilot. He received his law degree from George Washington University in 1927 and left the army to open a private practice in Manila.

==World War II==
In 1940, Whitney returned to active duty. He worked in intelligence in Washington, DC, serving as the intelligence officer to the 14th Air Force in China until 1943, when General Douglas MacArthur requested for him to be assigned to the Southwest Pacific Theater. Initially stationed at MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters in Australia, Whitney helped to organize anti-Japanese resistance in the Philippines. Described by author William Manchester as an &quot;ultraconservative Manila corporation lawyer&quot;, Whitney held highly racist views towards Filipinos, and was also a staunch anti-communist, opposing U.S. aid to Philippine communist guerrillas, such as the Hukbalahap.

Whitney was present at the Battle of Leyte in 1944 and landed in the Philippines with MacArthur, after which he was assigned chief of the Philippine section of the Allied Intelligence Bureau. After the restoration of the Commonwealth of the Philippines by Allied forces, Whitney was assigned responsibility for Philippine civil affairs.

==Occupation of Japan==
After Japan surrendered, Whitney accompanied MacArthur to Atsugi Air Base and became Chief of the Government Section at GHQ. With Lt. Col. Milo Rowell, he drafted the Constitution of Japan and sent it to the Diet for approval. Historians emphasize the similarity of occupation policies to the US New Deal programs of the 1930s. Moore and Robinson note that &quot;New Deal liberalism seemed natural, even to conservative Republicans such as MacArthur and Whitney.&quot;

Whitney remained close to MacArthur throughout the occupation and served as Chief of Government Section at his headquarters. He accompanied MacArthur during the Korean War and received the Silver Star and a second Legion of Merit for his brief visits to the front. Whitney resigned from the army after MacArthur was removed from command in 1951. He was decorated with the Army Distinguished Service Medal at his retirement ceremony. In 1956, Whitney&#x27;s biography of his commander, &quot;MacArthur: His Rendezvous With History&quot;, was published.

==Decorations==

==Legacy==
Whitney is buried at Arlington National Cemetery. He is also represented at the MacArthur Landing Memorial National Park in Leyte, in the Philippines as one of the statues of MacArthur and his party wading ashore at Leyte. Whitney&#x27;s statue is behind the statues of Sergio Osmeña and Carlos P. Romulo.

==In popular culture==
Whitney was played by Dick O&#x27;Neill in the 1977 film &quot;MacArthur&quot;

Whitney appears frequently as one of MacArthur&#x27;s key advisors in James Webb&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s General.&quot;

<text>Hopper was a proposed European Space Agency (ESA) orbital spaceplane and reusable launch vehicle. The Hopper was a FESTIP (Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme) system study design.

Hopper was one of several proposals for a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) developed by the ESA. The proposed reusable launch vehicles were to be used for the inexpensive delivery of satellite payloads into orbit as early as 2015. A prototype of Hopper, known as (EADS) Phoenix, was a German-led European project which involved the construction and testing of a one-seventh scale model of the proposed Hopper. On 8 May 2004, a single test flight of the Phoenix was conducted at the North European Aerospace Test range in Kiruna, Sweden, which was followed by more tests later that month.

==Development==
===Background===
From the 1980s onwards, there was growing international interest in the development of reusable spacecraft; at the time, only the superpowers of the era, the Soviet Union and the United States, had developed this capability. European nations such as the United Kingdom and France embarked on their own national programs to produce spaceplanes, such as HOTOL and Hermes, while attempting to attract the backing of the multinational European Space Agency (ESA). While these programs ultimately did not garner enough support to continue development, there was still demand within a number of the ESA&#x27;s member states to pursue the development of reusable space vehicles. During the 1990s, in addition to the development and operation of several technology demonstrator programs, such as the Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator (ARD), the ESA were also working on the production of a long-term framework for the eventual development of a viable reusable spacecraft, known as the Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP).

Under FLPP, the ESA and European industrial partners performed detailed investigations of several partially-reusable launch vehicle concepts; the aim of the program was to prepare a suitable vehicle to, upon a favorable decision by the ESA&#x27;s member-nations, proceed with the production of a Next Generation Launcher (NGL). A total of four launch concepts were studied: the Horizontal Take-Off (HTO) Hopper, the Vertical Take-Off (VTO) Hopper, the Reusable First Stage (RFS), and the liquid fly-back booster. Each of these concept vehicles consisted of a reusable winged booster, which was paired with an expendable upper stage, to deliver a payload in geostationary transfer orbit.

The HTO Hopper variant was designed for horizontal take-off, the first portion of which was to be achieved via a rocket sled arrangement. It possessed a relatively conventional wing-body configuration, although one atypical feature was the nose of the spacecraft, which possessed a deliberately low camber so that the required size of the elevons for desired trim functionality could be reduced while also resulting in an improved internal structure, such as in the accommodation of the nose gear. Aerodynamically, the HTO Hopper configuration features a rounded delta planform wing at a 60-degree leading edge sweep, which was matched with a central vertical stabilizer and a flat-bottomed underside for the purpose of maximizing the spacecraft&#x27;s performance during hypersonic flight.

The alternative VTO Hopper variant was designed for vertical take-off, being launched conventionally via an expendable launch system. It featured a relatively traditional slender missile-like body but differed in the presence of a small delta wing at a 45-degree leading edge sweep and a central vertical stabilizer arrangement. In terms of its structure, the VTO Hopper possessed a circular cross section complete with a loft fillet on the underside of the craft which functioned to accommodate both the wings and body flap; it also featured a booster which was designed to carry the payload upon the nose of the fuselage. Studies determined that both the HTO and the VTO variant concepts possessed a relatively similar reentry load environment.

===HTO Hopper - Selection===
The HTO Hopper was adopted for further development work under another ESA initiative in the form of the FESTIP (Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme) system design study. During 1998, it was decided that the design of Hopper fulfilled all of the established requirements. At this point, the spacecraft was to be composed of a single-stage reusable vehicle which would not attain orbital velocity itself. Hopper reportedly held the promise of delivering lower cost orbital deployment of payloads. An EADS spokesperson stated that a reusable launch vehicle like Hopper could halve the cost of sending a satellite into orbit, which reportedly had been determined to be around per kilogram of payload in 2004.

The envisioned mission profile of Hopper would have involved several phases. The launch phase was to be achieved by using a 4 km magnetic horizontal track, which was to be purpose-built at the Guiana Space Centre in French Guiana, that would accelerate the spacecraft up to launch speed. Upon reaching an altitude of 130 km, the vehicle would fire an expendable rocket-powered upper stage to attain orbital speed; once it had achieved the necessary height and speed, it would have released its satellite payload, which would independently ascend higher still to reach the desired orbit. Reportedly, Hopper was designed to deliver 7.5 tonne satellites into an orbit of 130 km above the surface of the Earth. Following the release of its payload, the vehicle would have then glided down in a controller descent. It was intended that the spacecraft would land at a predetermined island facility in the Atlantic Ocean, after which it would have been transported back to French Guiana by ship for further flights.

Multinational aerospace conglomerate EADS was responsible for the project management of Hopper, as well as for the development of the project&#x27;s software-based elements. A number of other partner companies were also involved in the spacecraft&#x27;s development. Reportedly, both the ESA and EADS had originally intended to complete development of Hopper between 2015 and 2020. After the first glide test using the &quot;Phoenix&quot; prototype in May 2004, no further updates on the programme were forthcoming; it is believed that work on Hopper has been discontinued.
==Prototype - Phoenix==

The &quot;Phoenix RLV&quot; launcher, the prototype of the Hopper launcher, was announced by DASA in June 1999 to be developed and produced as a portion of the wider ASTRA program of the German Aerospace Center (DLR), a project founded by the German Federal Government, EADS&#x27; Astrium subsidiary and the state of Bremen. Reportedly, EADS and the state of Bremen invested at least €8.2 million and €4.3 million respectively in the ASTRA programme. A further contribution of €16 million was sourced from partner companies on the program, such as the Bremen-based OHB-System, the DLR and the Federal Ministry for Education and Research. Construction of the prototype began in 2000.

The &quot;Phoenix RLV&quot; was long, had a weight of , and a wingspan of . During its design, an emphasis had been placed on minimizing drag by making the vehicle as small as possible. The fuselage interior was occupied by various avionics and onboard systems, providing navigation, data transfer, energy supply, and artificial intelligence functions to allow it to automatically perform its data-gathering mission. Phoenix was one-sixth the size of the planned Hopper vehicle. The final version of the vehicle was expected to be able to support the reentry forces and heat, and be able to glide from an altitude of . Integration and system testing works were completed in April 2004.

===Drop tests - May 2004===
On Saturday, May 8, 2004, the Phoenix prototype underwent a large-scale drop-test at the North European Aerospace Test range in Kiruna, Sweden. The vehicle was lifted by helicopter and dropped from a height of . Following a 90-second guided glide, the prototype reportedly landed with precision and without incident. The primary aim of the test was to assess the glider potential of the craft. More specifically, the Phoenix explored various methods of performing automatic landings that would not involve any human intervention; guidance was provided by multiple means of navigation, including GPS satellites, radar and laser altimeters, and various pressure and speed sensors. According to EADS spokesman Mathias Spude, the prototype had landed within three centimeters of the intended target.

Additional tests had already been scheduled, including three that were planned to occur during the following two weeks, which were to build towards the testing of more challenging landings (involving the spacecraft being dropped from different angles or orientations relative to the landing site). Furthermore, the project had an anticipated milestone of releasing the prototype from an altitude of within three years. However, EADS noted prior to the flight that further tests would be dependent on the craft&#x27;s performance during the initial flight.

Two further test flights were conducted on May 13 (a repeat of the May 8 drop test) and May 16.

==Longer term - Socrates==
In the long term, if successful and viable, the landing technology tested on Phoenix was to be incorporated into a follow-on re-usable vehicle, which was to be named &quot;Socrates&quot;. While not envisioned to serve as an orbital vehicle, &quot;Socrates&quot; was to be capable of flying at up to 10 times the speed of sound, as well as of performing very rapid turnaround times between flights as a steppingstone towards re-usability.

<text>KBPI (107.9 FM, &quot;107-9 KBPI&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to Fort Collins, Colorado. It is owned by iHeartMedia and it broadcasts an active rock radio format.

KBPI&#x27;s studios are located in Denver in the Tech Center. In December 2017, iHeartMedia assembled a trimulcast of KBPI along the Interstate 25 corridor on the 107.9 frequency, by moving KBPI&#x27;s main signal to 107.9 in Fort Collins, as well as to translator station K300CP in Denver, and switching KDZA in Pueblo/Colorado Springs to a simulcast of KBPI.

==History==
KBPI started at 105.9 MHz in Denver on June 21, 1965. It had studios on the 20th floor of the Daniels &amp; Fisher Tower in downtown Denver. The owner and general manager of the station was Bill Pierson, who named KBPI for &quot;Bill Pierson Incorporated&quot;. The station featured a progressive rock format. Pierson sold the station in 1974. The station continued its rock format under the new owner, Progressive Broadcasters, Incorporated.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the station moved to an album-oriented rock (AOR) sound. Its television commercials featured a blonde woman lip synching with bits of popular rock songs and DJ&#x27;s voices, and the tagline &quot;KBPI Rocks the Rockies!&quot; (elongated with rolling R sounds). This catchphrase is still used in advertising and for a while the campaign was used at other rock radio stations in the United States and Canada. The &quot;blonde woman&quot; AKA &quot;KBPI&#x27;s Remarkable Mouth&quot; was Kelly Harmon, sister of actor Mark Harmon.

During the 1970s, KBPI gained press for inviting people to bring their disco records to the station office for destruction, and this was frequently broadcast live over the air to the tune of Black Sabbath songs. This was commonplace among AOR stations who were riding the anti-Disco theme at the time. For four years, Steven B. and the Hawk ruled the Denver morning FM ratings, mixing rock music with their witty comments and routines. As they put it, &quot;It really didn&#x27;t matter what kind of music they played. Listeners tuned in to hear them.&quot;

Their comedic style was highlighted by a self-deprecating sense of humor, rather than &quot;shock jock talk&quot;. The duo ridiculed the entertainment industry, regularly parodying movie and TV stars. One of their favorite routines was an ongoing spoof of soap operas. They created their own ongoing series, whose titles were partially taken from the real shows that aired at the time: &quot;Edge of Guiding Days of My Children Turning Hospital&quot;. They also did commercials featuring &quot;Whamco&quot; products and promotions.

Don Hawkins died unexpectedly in November 1994, following a routine surgery. Steven B. Williams, who had become a nationally prominent voiceover artist for television stations and networks including Nick at Nite and moved to California, was found dead of a gunshot wound in May 2006 off Catalina Island, and a business associate who embezzled the inheritance of Williams&#x27;s father was convicted of his murder in 2011.

On April 20, 1994, Chancellor Media moved KBPI to 106.7 FM, which had been the home of KAZY, its long-time rock competitor and a former sister station to KLZ-AM-TV. Notable DJs include Willie B., DMac, Marc Stout, Scoop, Missy, Uncle Nasty, Matt Need, Double A Ron, Dan, Tim Bourke, Eddie, Joe the Russian and B Lo.

===Move to 106.7===
106.7 FM signed the air on June 19, 1962, as KLZ-FM. At first it simulcast its AM counterpart KLZ, but in the early 1970s, it started airing a rock format. In 1977, KLZ-FM changed its call sign to KAZY (now at 93.7 FM in Cheyenne, Wyoming) and continued with a rock format until KBPI moved to the frequency on April 20, 1994 (105.9 would then flip to hot AC as KALC).

Dean and Rog hosted the KBPI Morning Show from 1991 to 1996. They were known for features like &quot;The Birthday Scam&quot; and &quot;Torture Tuesday&quot;, as well as other stunts. In 1996, the duo and two other station employees were charged with disorderly conduct for entering a mosque while playing &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; on a trumpet and trombone. This was in response to Nuggets player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf&#x27;s refusal to stand for the anthem before games.

After more than twenty years with a mainstream album rock format, KBPI shifted to active rock in late 1995, calling its new format &quot;The New Music Revolution&quot;. At the time, KBPI had an alternative rock lean. A few years later, KBPI would bring back the old slogan &quot;Rocks the Rockies&quot;.

In 2007, the station was nominated for &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;″ Industry Achievement Award for best active rock station in a top 25 market.

===Move to 107.9===
On July 27, 1975, 107.9 FM first signed on as KCOL-FM. It was the sister station to KCOL (1410 AM). KCOL-FM aired a beautiful music format. In 1988, the station switched to a Top 40 format as KIMN, which were the call letters of a popular Top 40 station in Denver in past years. The station took the call letters KPAW in 1995, at first keeping its Top 40 format, then moving to classic hits around 2000, and later to classic rock.

In December 2017, iHeartMedia launched a trimulcast of KBPI, utilizing the analog 107.9 frequency across several markets in the Interstate 25 corridor. On December 5, the programming and call letters of classic rock KPAW, which targets Fort Collins and the Northern Front Range, was moved to KYWY (92.9) in Cheyenne, Wyoming (which moved its adult contemporary format to KOLT-FM HD2 (100.7-HD2) and translator station K246CI (97.1) four days prior).

On December 11, KBPI&#x27;s programming and call letters then moved to the 107.9 frequency vacated by KPAW and co-channel Denver translator K300CP, while sister station KDZA in Pueblo, which also serves Colorado Springs, flipped to a simulcast of KBPI (and switched their calls to KBPL the following month). The previous 106.7 signal, which warehoused the KYWY call letters, simulcasted KBPI for a week before flipping to country as KWBL on December 18, 2017. KBPL partially broke away from the trimulcast in January 2019, reintroducing local hosts in the afternoon and nighttime dayparts, and carrying a separate playlist.

===K300CP history===
The K300CP translator launched early as 2015 in as an FM translator of KOA (850) until November 1, 2015, when KOA was switched to the newly-acquired K231BQ (94.1). After a simulcast of Christmas music from the HD2 subchannel of KRFX (103.5) through the holidays, it began to translate the sports radio format of KDSP (760) until December 11, 2017, when it converted to a simulcast of KDHT-HD2. The translator is not owned by iHeartMedia, but the WAY-FM Network through their Hope Media Group licensing subsidiary.

<doc id="1096918" wikidata="Q7868839" url="?curid=1096918" title="USS Des Moines (CL-17)">
<text>USS &quot;Des Moines&quot; (C-15/PG-29/CL-17) was a protected cruiser of the in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first Navy ship named for the city of Des Moines, Iowa.

&quot;Des Moines&quot; was launched on 20 September 1902 at the Fore River Ship and Engine Company, Quincy, Massachusetts, sponsored by Miss Elsie Macomber; and commissioned on 5 March 1904.

She was designated PG-29 on 7 July 1920, and redesignated CL-17 on 8 August 1921.

==Service history==

===Commissioning &amp; pre-war===

In June and July 1904 &quot;Des Moines&quot; cruised in the West Indies, and on 29 August cleared Boston for duty with the European Squadron, visiting ports in France, England, Ireland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and Italy before her arrival at Barbados on 11 December to join the North Atlantic Fleet. With this force she cruised in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico in target practice and other exercises, making surveys, and protecting American interests.

&quot;Des Moines&quot; returned to Boston on 16 February 1906, and for the next 5 years cruised widely in the Atlantic, the Caribbean, and the Gulf of Mexico. She joined in exercises, gave passage to officials and Marines, and took part in ceremonial observances, chief among which were the interment of John Paul Jones at Annapolis in April 1906, and the Naval Review for President Theodore Roosevelt in Oyster Bay in September 1906. In 1908, Templin Potts took command of the ship.

Between 15 April 1910 and 23 January 1911, &quot;Des Moines&quot; cruised the coast of Africa, gathering information about commercial and political conditions, and called at the Canaries, Lisbon, Cádiz, and Gibraltar. Between March and November 1911 she returned to her Atlantic and West Indian duty, and on 6 December 1911 was placed in reserve for repairs at Boston. Returned to full commission on 3 September 1912, she sailed to the Caribbean to observe and report conditions in the island countries and Central America, and to protect American citizens from political turmoil. She sailed north periodically for at Portsmouth Navy Yard, and on 24 April 1915 sailed from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for Alexandria, Egypt.

===World War I===

Between 26 May 1915 and 25 April 1917, &quot;Des Moines&quot; protected American citizens and interests threatened in the Middle Eastern theater of war, carrying missionaries and other refugees out of Turkey and Syria, delivering relief funds, carrying United States officials, and serving on exercises which took her to ports in Italy, France, Spain, and Algeria. After overhaul at the New York Navy Yard, she joined the Cruiser Force of the Atlantic Fleet for duty escorting merchant convoys from New York and Norfolk, Virginia, to their rendezvous in the Atlantic with destroyers which took up the escort job. In addition to eight such voyages, &quot;Des Moines&quot; voyaged to Sydney, Nova Scotia, on escort duty, and trained armed guard crews.

While undergoing repairs at New York in January 1919, &quot;Des Moines&quot; was sent to sea to aid in rescue operations at the scene of the grounded &quot;Northern Pacific&quot;. All of the fast transport&#x27;s 2,200 passengers were rescued, 50 of them by &quot;Des Moines&quot;. She sailed from New York on 11 April 1919 for Archangel, Russia, and duty with the Naval Forces in Northern Russia. Here &quot;Des Moines&quot; protected American interests from the disturbances of the Bolshevik Revolution, and carried home American troops who had served around Archangel, returning to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 27 October.

===Post war &amp; decommissioning===

&quot;Des Moines&quot; cruised off Mexico between May and September 1920, reporting on political conditions, and joining in relief efforts during an epidemic of the plague. She joined the Special Service Squadron based at the Panama Canal Zone to cruise Central American waters, and the west coast of South America promoting friendly relations between the United States and its sister American republics until 5 March 1921, when she returned to the Portsmouth Navy Yard. There she was decommissioned 9 April 1921, and sold to Union Shipbuilding Company for scrapping on 11 March 1930. &quot;Des Moines&quot; was towed from Portsmouth to the company&#x27;s ship breaking yard in Baltimore, Maryland by the steamer &quot;Columbine&quot;. She arrived there on 2 April 1930.

<text>Marshside is a suburb of the town of Southport, Merseyside, England.
It is part of the ancient parish of North Meols and was formerly a detached settlement, on the northern fringe of what is now Southport.

Marshside&#x27;s most notable features are neighbours: the SSSI and nature reserve on the opposite side of Marine Drive. The sandwinning plant closed in early 2007. Whilst operational, it extracted thousands of tonnes of Southport sand per year for use in industry. The nature reserve is managed by the RSPB and provides food and accommodation to many native and migratory birds.

Marshside&#x27;s traditional industry was shrimping, and the practice still continues to a diminished degree today.

Marshside has four schools: Marshside Primary School, St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School, Larkfield Primary School (between Larkfield Lane and Preston New Road) and Stanley High School (on Fleetwood Road). The last of these is the largest, with around 800 pupils between the ages of 11 and 16.

Marshside was a local centre of the Temperance movement, and the Marshside Temperance Hall on Shellfield Road, built 1884 and rebuilt 1934, is a registered charity (Charity number: 233530), which continues to host community events, including the Tuesday Club which has been running for over 100 years. The hall is also used as a rehearsal space for the Marshside Brass Band, the only brass band in Southport.

Marshside has surprisingly few pubs (compared with neighbouring Churchtown), possibly in part due to the strong tradition of Methodism and Temperance in the former village. However, there is The Marsh Harrier (formerly named &quot;The Shrimper)&quot; on Fylde Road (next to The Co-operative Food mini-supermarket development). The Marsh Harrier is a food-serving pub and part of a large chain.

Immediately to the west of The Marsh Harrier pub, The Co-operative Food development also includes a general practice, The Corner Surgery, a fish and chips shop, Fylde Fish and Chips, and the Fylde Road Pharmacy.

Also on Fylde Road, further west towards the junction with Marshside Road, is the Fleetwood Hesketh Sports and Social Club. Built on land acquired from the Meols Hall estate in Churchtown, this private members club has various sports teams including football, cricket, crown green bowls and indoor bowls, darts, and snooker. It is nicknamed locally &quot;The Hut&quot;, as the original structure was adapted from former army huts.

St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish Club on Marshside Road is another establishment licensed to serve alcohol. Situated at the back of the old church, the members club is open throughout the week.

In the early twentieth century, Marshside had its own completely unique dialect feature, involving a parasitic nasal consonant, occurring after certain final consonants, mostly plosives, in words at the end of a sense group, and before the plural inflexion [z] medially and at the end of a sense group.

<text>Blowick is a suburb on the east side of the town of Southport, Merseyside, England.

==History and etymology==
Blowick is part of the ancient parish of North Meols and was formerly a detached settlement, on the northern fringe of what is now Southport.

The name derives from the Old Norse name &quot;Bla Vik&quot; meaning &quot;dark bay&quot; as it was located at the end of a large inlet on the ancient lake of Martin Mere called &quot;The Wyke&quot; which ended roughly at Crowland Street and drained into the Old Pool. There are historically two Blowicks: Higher Blowick, situated around what is now the junction of Everard Road and Southbank Road, and Lower Blowick (Butts Lane, Norwood Road, etc.), which is the area around what locals tend to refer to now as simply Blowick. The countryside on which the nearby Kew Housing Estate is built on what was known as Blowick Moss, and a local road on the estate is known as Blowick Moss Lane.

==Landmarks==
The Southport gas holder on Crowland Street was the tallest building on the Southport skyline, visible from as far afield as Blackpool and Parbold. The largest tower was decommissioned in January 2008, due to an environmental risk posed by the storage of oil within it. In September 2008, National Grid announced that two of the three gas towers would be dismantled by August 2009, with the fate of the smallest tower remaining uncertain. The news has met with mixed reactions from local residents, though the gas holder was voted one of the North West&#x27;s biggest eyesores in a competition run by the BBC.

The Thatch &amp; Thistle is a modern thatched public house on Norwood Road built on the site of the original Blowick pub. Known for a time as The Thatch Inn, the pub closed on 21 August 2008 after Cains Brewery went into administration, but reopened the following day under new management.

Haig Avenue football stadium, the home of National League North team Southport F.C., is also located in Blowick.

The Southport Bus Depot is situated on Canning Road in Blowick and is a Victorian building with lavish architecture for a storage building and even has a clock built into the wall.

==Education==
The area has a secondary school Meols Cop High School and a sixth form college King George V College. The former was previously a secondary modern school and the latter a grammar school.

==Transport==
Blowick is served by Meols Cop railway station on Northern&#x27;s Manchester to Southport Line. The station opened in 1887, originally as part of the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway. In years gone by, Blowick had a further two railway stations: (closed 1938), also on the Liverpool, Southport and Preston Junction Railway, and Blowick railway station (closed 1939) on the Manchester and Southport Railway.

<text>USS &quot;Chattanooga&quot; (C-16/PG-30/CL-18) was a protected cruiser in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the second Navy ship named for the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee.

==Construction==
&quot;Chattanooga&quot; was one of six &quot;Denver&quot;-class protected cruisers ordered for the US Navy on 14 December 1899. She was laid down at the Crescent Shipyard of Elizabethport, New Jersey on 29 March 1900, and launched on 7 March 1903. Construction was much slower than contracted (the contracted completion date was 14 June 1902), and when the shipbuilding trust that owned the Crescent Shipyard, the US Government cancelled the contract and took possession of the part-completed ship, which was moved to the New York Navy Yard for finishing in October 1903.

&quot;Chattanooga&quot; was commissioned on 11 October 1904. After sea trials in January 1905, during which she reached a speed of in a four-hour trial, she reported to the Atlantic Fleet.

==Service history==

===Pre-war service===

&quot;Chattanooga&quot;&#x27;s first cruise following shakedown was to the Caribbean, from which she returned to New York City to join the squadron which cleared for Cherbourg, France 18 June 1905. At Cherbourg, received on board the body of John Paul Jones, which the squadron brought home to the United States Naval Academy, arriving at Annapolis 23 July. Through the remainder of the year, &quot;Chattanooga&quot; aided in training men of the Maine and Massachusetts Naval Militia, and cruised briefly in the Caribbean. On 28 December she cleared San Juan, Puerto Rico, for the Suez Canal and duty in the Pacific. Between 29 April 1906, when she arrived at Cavite, P.I., and 10 August 1910, when she reported at Puget Sound Navy Yard for inactivation, &quot;Chattanooga&quot; joined the Asiatic Fleet in its winter operations in the Philippines and summer cruises to China, aiding in representing America&#x27;s strength and interest in the Orient. &quot;Chattanooga&quot; was decommissioned at Puget Sound Navy Yard 17 September 1910.

===World War I===

&quot;Chattanooga&quot; was placed in reserve commission 31 August 1912, remaining at Puget Sound, and in full commission 21 April 1914, for duty in Mexican waters. Through 1915 and 1916, she cruised to protect American interests from the disorder of the Mexican Revolution, and this duty continued after America&#x27;s entrance into World War I until May 1917. &quot;Chattanooga&quot; then sailed through the Panama Canal for several months of patrol duties in the Caribbean, searching for German raiders. From July 1917, she escorted convoys from the Atlantic coast to rendezvous with other escorts in the approaches to French ports. This rugged duty across the stormy mid-Atlantic was broken only by two escort missions to Nova Scotia.

&quot;Chattanooga&quot; took part in the Victory Fleet Review taken by the Secretary of the Navy in New York harbor 26 December 1918. After an overhaul, the cruiser carried a party of Liberian officials to Monrovia, then turned north for Plymouth, England, which she reached 7 May. As flagship of U.S. Naval Forces, European Waters, &quot;Chattanooga&quot; sailed among English and French ports until June, though on 1 April 1919, she, along with USS Tallahassee, took part in the closure of the United States Navy facilities on White&#x27;s Island and Agar&#x27;s Island in the British Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, 640 miles off North Carolina. On 29 June, she served as leading honor escort guarding President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s departure from France in &quot;George Washington&quot;, then sailed on to call at German and Belgian ports before arriving in the Mediterranean for service as flagship for U.S. Naval Forces, Turkish Waters. Cruising primarily in the Black Sea, she also served in the Adriatic in connection with the disposal of ships of the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. From January through May 1921, she conducted regular patrols with the cruiser squadron assigned to European waters, and on 1 June, returned to the United States. She was decommissioned at Boston 19 July 1921, and laid up at Portsmouth Navy Yard until sold 8 March 1930.

&quot;Chattanooga&quot;″s bell was at a now-closed American Legion post in Shelbyville Tennessee, in late 2015 was at the National Medal of Honor Museum in the Northgate Mall, and soon will be incorporated into a memorial to the victims of the attack on the recruiting station at Chattanooga, Tennessee.

<doc id="1096936" wikidata="Q841640" url="?curid=1096936" title="The Abolition of Man">
<text>The Abolition of Man is a 1943 book by C. S. Lewis. Subtitled &quot;Reflections on education with special reference to the teaching of English in the upper forms of schools&quot;, it uses a contemporary text about poetry as a starting point for a defense of objective value and natural law. Lewis goes on to warn readers about the consequences of doing away with ideas of objective value. It defends &quot;man&#x27;s power over nature&quot; as something worth pursuing but criticizes the use of it to debunk values, the value of science itself being among them. The title of the book then, is taken to mean that moral relativism threatens the idea of humanity itself. The book was first delivered as a series of three evening lectures at King&#x27;s College, Newcastle, part of the University of Durham, as the Riddell Memorial Lectures on 24–26 February 1943.

==Moral subjectivism vs. natural law==
Lewis begins with a critical response to &quot;The Green Book&quot; by &quot;Gaius and Titius&quot;: &quot;The Control of Language: A Critical Approach to Reading and Writing&quot;, published in 1939 by Alexander (&quot;Alec&quot;) King and Martin Ketley. &quot;The Green Book&quot; was used as a text for upper form students in British schools.

Lewis criticises the authors for subverting student values and claims that they teach that all statements of value (such as &quot;this waterfall is sublime&quot;) are merely statements about the speaker&#x27;s feelings and say nothing about the object. Such a view, Lewis argues, makes nonsense of value talk. It implies, for example, that a speaker who condemns some act as contemptible is really only saying, &quot;I have contemptible feelings.&quot;

By denying that values are real or that sentiments can be reasonable, subjectivism saps moral motivation and robs people of the ability to respond emotionally to experiences of real goodness and real beauty in literature and in the world. Moreover, Lewis claims that it is impossible to be a consistent moral subjectivist. Even the authors of &quot;The Green Book&quot; clearly believe that some things, such as improved student learning, are truly good and desirable.

Lewis cites ancient thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle and St. Augustine, who believed that the purpose of education was to train children in &quot;ordinate affections&quot;, to train them to like and dislike what they ought and to love the good and hate the bad. Lewis claims that although such values are universal, they do not develop automatically or inevitably in children. Thus, they are not &quot;natural&quot; in that sense of the word, but they must be taught through education. Those who lack them lack the specifically human element, the trunk that unites intellectual man with visceral (animal) man, and they may be called &quot;men without chests&quot;.

== Men without chests: a dystopian future ==
Lewis criticizes modern attempts to debunk natural values, such as those that would deny objective value to the waterfall, on rational grounds. He says that there is a set of objective values that have been shared, with minor differences, by every culture, which he refers to as &quot;the traditional moralities of East and West, the Christian, the Pagan, and the Jew...&quot;. Lewis calls that the &quot;Tao&quot;, from the Taoist word for the ultimate &quot;way&quot; or &quot;path&quot; of reality and human conduct. (Although Lewis saw natural law as supernatural in origin, as evidenced by his use of it as a proof of theism in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, his argument in the book does not rest on theism.)

Without the &quot;Tao&quot;, no value judgments can be made at all, and modern attempts to do away with some parts of traditional morality for some &quot;rational&quot; reason always proceed by arbitrarily selecting one part of the &quot;Tao&quot; and using it as grounds to debunk the others.

The final chapter describes the ultimate consequences of this debunking: a not-so distant future in which the values and morals of the majority are controlled by a small group who rule by a perfect understanding of psychology, and who in turn, being able to see through any system of morality that might induce them to act in a certain way, are ruled only by their own unreflected whims. In surrendering rational reflection on their own motivations, the controllers will no longer be recognizably human, the controlled will be robot-like, and the Abolition of Man will have been completed.

An appendix to &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; lists a number of basic values seen by Lewis as parts of the &quot;Tao&quot;, supported by quotations from different cultures. The dystopian ideas in &quot;Abolition of Man&quot; is fleshed out in Lewis&#x27;s science fiction novel, &quot;That Hideous Strength,&quot; as Lewis himself makes clear in the preface of the story.

== Impact amongst public intellectuals ==
While the book was considered a favourite of the author, Lewis believed it was &quot;almost totally ignored by the public.&quot;

By the 21st Century that was no longer true, at least amongst intellectuals, both Christian and non-Christian. Jonah Goldberg has assessed it to be &quot;one of the greatest books&quot; of its era as it is helping preserve ideas of moral absolutism. The Catholic Bishop, Robert Barron, considers the book almost prophetic on the topic of &quot;values&quot;, such that today they accepted as being &quot;projections of our feelings and subjective whims, and consequently, anyone who dares to speak of properly objective truth or objective moral value is engaging in an oppressive play of power.&quot; Carl Trueman has argued that the collection of essays is strongly relevant to today as &quot;the turmoil in our contemporary Western world is a function of the collapse of consensus concerning what it means to be human... a time marked by a crisis of anthropology.&quot; 

Commenting on the book&#x27;s more political elements, Michael Ward argues that Lewis&#x27;s essay is an early warning that democracies are vulnerable to &quot;the dangers of subjectivism.&quot; Ward writes that “Democracies can only be preserved...if they view ethical systems in an undemocratic light.” Expanding upon this, Samuel Gregg, speculates that Lewis&#x27;s indirect critique of democracy may have unsettled readers immediately after its publication, given the political climate of World War II and the immediate threat of authoritarian dictatorships. In time, however, similar observations were shared and developed by both equivalent and later thinkers such as Wilhelm Röpke, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks.

Lewis&#x27;s concept of &quot;the Tao&quot; has become understood as a shorthand of Natural law. As such, his essay is now regarded as both key to the revival of this idea of natural law, and a strong counterpoint to ethics of Karl Barth, where morality depends on Special revelation. Some legal minds have come to see Lewis&#x27;s essay as bolstering the Calvinist understanding of Natural Law, as being transcendent in nature.

Ross Douthat has written about the book&#x27;s ideas many times in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, listing it as one of the books he would assign to all college students, especially as they critique the threats of modern technology. The philosopher Peter Kreeft shared this view, including it as one of six &quot;books to read to save Western Civilization,&quot; alongside &quot;Lost in the Cosmos&quot; by Walker Percy, &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C. S. Lewis, &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot; by G. K. Chesterton, &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; by G. K. Chesterton, and &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley.

Passages from &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; are included in William Bennett&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;The Book of Virtues.&quot; However, as historian Paul E Michelson points out, many intellectuals have been prompted by Lewis&#x27;s work to argue directly against him. This includes B. F. Skinner in his work &quot;Beyond Freedom and Dignity&quot;. Skinner asserts that in his Behaviorist school of psychology, contra Lewis, &quot;Man is being abolished.. What is being abolished is autonomous man... the man defended by the literatures of freedom and dignity.&quot;

==Modern rankings and reviews==
*&quot;National Review&quot; ranked the book #7 in its 100 Best Non-Fiction Books of the 20th Century list.
*The conservative Intercollegiate Studies Institute ranked the book as the second best book of the 20th century.

== In popular culture ==

A 2019 journal article, &quot;Science Fiction and the Abolition of Man&quot; argued that many science fiction characters have drawn on the idea of &quot;men without chests&quot;, including the logical Vulcans of &quot;Star Trek&quot; to the &quot;emotionally stunted&quot; replicants in &quot;Blade Runner&quot;. 

In 2022 artist Carson Grubaugh created a comic book adaptation, “Abolition of Man,” using illustrations generated by artificial intelligence. The text of Lewis&#x27; work serves as definitional prompts for the AI&#x27;s images. 

Many ideas in Lewis&#x27; book have also appeared in music, including:
* Christian hip hop duo Mars ILL named the track &quot;The Abolition of manCHILD&quot; from their 2002 album &quot;Raw Material&quot; after the book.
* In 2003, the post-hardcore band Thrice based the lyrics of the song &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot; on the book. It is featured in the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Artist in the Ambulance&quot;.
* &quot;TAO&quot;, the sixth studio album of Canadian rapper Shad, released in 2021 was heavily inspired by &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;.

<doc id="1096937" wikidata="Q3348124" url="?curid=1096937" title="Dahi vada">
<text>Dahi vada or Dahi Bada is a type of &quot;chaat&quot; (snack) originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is prepared by soaking vadas (fried lentil balls) in thick dahi (curd).

==Names==
Dahi vada is also known as &quot;dahi vade&quot; (दही वडे) in Marathi, &quot;dahi barey/dahi balley&quot; (دہی بھلے/دہی بڑے) in Urdu, &quot;dahi bada&quot;/&quot;dahi vada&quot; (बड़ा बड़ा/दही वड़ा) in Hindi, &quot;dahi bhalla&quot; (دہی بھلا/ਦਹੀ ਭੱਲਾ) in Punjabi, &quot;thayir vadai(தயிர் வடை)&quot; in Tamil, &quot;thairu vada(തൈര് വട)&quot; in Malayalam, &quot;perugu vada&quot; in Telugu, &quot;mosaru vade&quot;(ಮೊಸರು ವಡೆ) in Kannada, &quot;dahi bara&quot; (ଦହି ବରା) in Odia and &quot;doi bora&quot; (দই বড়া) in Bengali.

==History==
A recipe for dahi wada (as &quot;kshiravata&quot;) is mentioned in &quot;Manasollasa&quot;, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka. Today, dahi vada is prepared on festival such as Holi.

==Preparation==
Washed urad lentils are soaked overnight and ground into a batter for the vada, then cooked in hot oil. The hot deep-fried vadas are first put in water and then transferred to thick beaten yogurt. The vadas are soaked for a period of time before serving. Additions to the batter may also include golden raisins. Vadas may be topped with coriander or mint leaves, chilli powder, crushed black pepper, chaat masala, cumin, shredded coconut, green chilies, boondi, thinly sliced fresh ginger, or pomegranate. Sweeter curd is preferred in some places in India, especially in Maharashtra and Gujarat, although the garnishing remains the same. A combination of coriander and tamarind chutney is often used as a garnish. The batter can be made using chickpea flour too.

== Locations ==
Dahi vada as popular street chaat is found in various cities across India, including Chennai, Bangaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Jaipur, Kolkata, Cuttack, and Indore. Dahi baray are also found in Pakistan, especially in Karachi.

<text>The A350 is a north–south primary route in southern England, that runs from the M4 motorway in Wiltshire to Poole in Dorset.

==Route==
Starting at junction 17 of the M4 motorway north of Chippenham, the first three miles are a dual carriageway to the northern outskirts of Chippenham, where a partly light-controlled roundabout splits traffic between the bypass section and the road into the town centre. The Chippenham bypass is punctuated by six more roundabouts, the last being at the Lackham College. In so doing it crosses the A420 to Bristol and the A4 for Bath to the West and Calne to the East.

It then goes past the small village of Lacock before reaching Melksham four miles later. The road then follows the Semington bypass, opened in 2004, to Westbury, crossing the A361 between Trowbridge and Devizes. This section of the road has two light-controlled junctions to connect the road to outlying areas of Trowbridge before reaching the Yarnbrook roundabout. This section is approximately 5 miles long.

The road takes a winding route through the town centre of Westbury before heading towards Warminster, where it splits from its original route at a light-controlled junction along the Warminster bypass. Where the bypass meets the A36 Bath to Salisbury road, they merge for about 3 miles, before the A350 continues south towards Shaftesbury, passing through Crockerton Green and Longbridge Deverill and beneath the A303.

The section between Shaftesbury and Blandford Forum is almost completely unimproved and in at least one location the road is not wide enough to allow two lorries to pass safely, with the remainder of this section being narrow with several dangerous blind corners, that could be described as resembling almost B-Road status. The road passes through the hamlet of Cann and the villages of Compton Abbas, Fontmell Magna, Sutton Waldron, Iwerne Minster and Stourpaine before reaching Blandford Forum.

At Blandford Forum is another bypass built to ease town centre traffic where the A350 crossed and merged with the A354. The bypass still merges the two roads for a short stretch. There are four roundabouts on this section, the last of which sees the two roads go their separate ways. The road then passes through the villages of Charlton Marshall, Spetisbury and Sturminster Marshall before crossing the A31 via a roundabout.

Before reaching Poole, the road joins the A35 at a grade separated junction before separating again at a roundabout at the north east end of Holes Bay. This section is a dual carriageway as far as Poole Railway Station. The final section crosses the Black Water Channel by the Poole Bridge before terminating at the roundabout on New Harbour Road where the Ferry Port is located.

== History ==

When first designated in 1922, the A350 ran only from Warminster to Poole. By 1948 the road had been extended north from Warminster to Chippenham on the former routes of the A363 and the A364. In the 1990s the road was extended north from Chippenham to the M4 motorway by renumbering the A429.

The Chippenham bypass was built in the 1990s as a single carriageway and was designed for future widening to dual carriageway. Work to dual the section between Chippenham Golf Club, where the original dual carriageway from the M4 motorway narrowed, to the Badger roundabout was completed in 2014, and the section from Brook roundabout to Bumper&#x27;s Farm roundabout, the junction with the A420 Bristol Road, was completed in 2016. The remaining sections, as far south as the junction with the A4 Bath Road, were completed in the following years.

In 2004, the route between Melksham and Semington was replaced by a new road that bypassed Semington and, like the Chippenham bypass, was designed to be dualled at a future date. The New Semington Aqueduct carries the Kennet and Avon Canal over this section.

In December 2023, Wiltshire Council awarded a £20.7 million contract for dualling the remaining sections of the A350 Chippenham bypass. Preparatory works began in January 2024 and were completed in mid-March. Construction is expected to start in May 2024 and continue until November 2025. 

==Proposed developments==

===Westbury===
A controversial £33 million bypass around Westbury was initially proposed in 1997, with public consultation and a selection of route options proposed in 1999. Wiltshire County Council&#x27;s Environment and Transport Committee selected the Eastern Route (though it was the least popular) as the &#x27;preferred route&#x27; in 2001, because the Council said that it offered the best and lowest cost way of relieving traffic congestion in the town centre. The council submitted an initial planning application during 2005. The council said that the government indicated that it was in favour of the project in 2006. The Council presented a further planning application in 2007.

The council&#x27;s selected route would pass to the east of the town. The council expected it to reduce traffic through Westbury, create more space for cyclists and pedestrians, and improve journey time reliability on the A350 by two minutes. It would also provide a new access road to the West Wilts Trading Estate, though not to the other Westbury trading estates, or the railway station or the designated Future Intermodal Freight Terminal. The scheme, would, by the council&#x27;s own forecasts, cause increased heavy goods vehicle flow through other West Wiltshire communities, such as Southwick, which already have over twice the HGVs of Westbury. The eastern bypass route is supported by the &#x27;Westbury Bypass Now&#x27; group.

The council&#x27;s route, which runs close to the Westbury White Horse, two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, near Salisbury Plain and through a Special Landscape Area, is not included in the Regional Transport Priority for South West England. The route has been described as &#x27;highly intrusive&#x27; by the council&#x27;s landscape officer. It attracted opposition from various environmental and local groups including the White Horse Alliance, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Woodland Trust, Friends of the Earth, Campaign for Better Transport and Wiltshire Wildlife Trust.

The scheme was &#x27;called in&#x27; in 2007. An Inquiry into the scheme was held in July 2008. It was adjourned until September–October after objectors noticed that some figures for lorry counts were out by 100%. The inquiry ended in the autumn of 2008. The decision was with John Denham the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. The planning inspectors recommended refusal of planning permission for Wiltshire Council&#x27;s eastern Westbury bypass scheme.

===Trowbridge===

A scheme has been proposed since 2015 to improve the A350 West Ashton/Yarnbrook junction to ease traffic flows at a noted bottleneck. This will involve the construction of a new relief road to replace the section north of the junction. Three new roundabouts are also proposed, to connect with the A363 Westbury Road, a link to Yarnbrook village and one at the existing West Ashton Road.

=== Melksham ===
In 2020, the government said £135m could be available to bypass Beanacre, north of Melksham, and provide a new route east of the town. Wiltshire Council consulted with the public in late 2020 and early 2021 on a number of options, including short and long routes to the east and west of the town, taking into account local traffic and east–west movements as well as the north–south primary route.

In June 2021, Wiltshire Council&#x27;s cabinet resolved to progress an eastern route that starts to the north of Beanacre and meets the A3102 and A365 before rejoining the current A350 south of the town, beyond Bowerhill. A shortlist of options around this route will again be subject to public consultation.

=== Future status ===
The A350 from the M4 to Warminster is designated as part of the &#x27;major road network&#x27;, a network of local authority &#x27;A&#x27; roads which are not classed as &#x27;strategic&#x27; but are locally or regionally important. Since 2020, Highways England (now National Highways) has been developing a South Coast to M4 route strategy. The current preferred route is the A36 to Bath, then the A46 to the M4. Due to the traffic situation in Bath, Highways England may propose de-listing the current route and adopting the A350 instead; this may release funding for further works between Poole and the M4.

<text>The Prince &amp; Me is a 2004 American romantic comedy film directed by Martha Coolidge, and starring Julia Stiles, Luke Mably and Ben Miller, with Miranda Richardson, James Fox and Alberta Watson. The film focuses on Paige Morgan, a pre-med college student in Wisconsin, who is pursued by a Danish prince posing as an ordinary college student. The film had 3 direct-to-video sequels created under different writers and a new director, with Kam Heskin replacing Julia Stiles in the role of Paige Morgan: &quot;The Prince &amp; Me 2: The Royal Wedding&quot; (2006), &quot;The Prince &amp; Me: A Royal Honeymoon&quot; (2008), and &quot;The Prince &amp; Me: The Elephant Adventure&quot; (2010).

==Plot==
Paige Morgan is an ambitious pre-medical student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, Denmark&#x27;s Crown Prince Edvard prefers to live the life of a playboy, and when with his family often ignores or marginalizes his royal responsibilities.

Inspired by a television commercial showing Wisconsin students flashing their breasts, Edvard meets with his parents, King Haraald and Queen Rosalind, and announces his intention to attend college in America—specifically, Wisconsin, and to do so anonymously. The Queen then dispatches Edvard&#x27;s majordomo, Søren, to chaperone the trip. Arriving at the university, Edvard orders him to keep his identity a secret and to call him &#x27;Eddie&#x27;.

Later at a bar, Eddie sees Paige serving and asks her to take off her shirt, like on television. She angrily drenches him with the drink hose and bouncers escort Eddie from the bar. Eddie later apologizes to Paige, but she is annoyed when they are assigned as lab partners for an organic chemistry class. Since the class is important for Paige&#x27;s medical school ambitions, she warns Eddie to not get in her way and reprimands him after he sleeps in through one of their lab experiments.

Running out of money, Eddie gets a job in the deli section of the bar. Paige reluctantly helps him during his first day, and the two start to mend fences. Paige does well in science, but she struggles in an English literature class. Eddie uses his earlier education to help her gain a better understanding of William Shakespeare, and Paige instructs him in common household chores like laundry.

Since Eddie is away from his family and unfamiliar with American holidays, Paige invites him to her parents’ dairy farm for Thanksgiving. Paige&#x27;s father explains how he struggles to keep the small farm afloat, and Eddie uses his mechanical skills to fine-tune a riding mower for a race, which he wins. Keith Kopetsky, a rival racer reveals to be a sore loser and punches Eddie. After the fight that follows, Paige treats his grazes and they kiss for the first time.

Back at school, Eddie and Paige study for final exams. They sneak off to the library stacks to pursue a romantic encounter, where they kiss and take off his jacket and shirt. They are shortly ambushed by members of the Danish tabloid press. Once away from the mayhem, Paige learns his real identity and walks away from him through the rain. Just then, Eddie is notified by his mother that his father is very ill and she asks him to return home.

While Paige is questioned at a viva voce panel about Shakespeare, she realizes that she loves Edvard and runs to find him, but his roommate Scotty tells her that he has already left for Denmark. She follows him there and while being driven round Copenhagen is delayed by a royal parade. Paige leaves her taxi and is recognized from the papers by the crowd, who call Edvard’s attention to her. He mounts her behind him on his horse, hurriedly opens a parliamentary session and takes her to the castle.

The queen objects to Edvard&#x27;s choice, but the king tells him that if he loves Paige, he should marry her. Edvard proposes and she accepts. After witnessing him reconcile workers and employers in a parliamentary committee, the queen realizes that Paige has helped him grow up at last and will make a good queen. However, during Eddie&#x27;s coronation ball, Paige remembers that she is betraying her ambition to become a doctor working in Third World countries, breaks off her engagement and returns home.

King Haraald abdicates and the newly crowned Edvard realizes that he too has responsibilities to shoulder. However, he arrives after Paige’s graduation and tells her that she is his choice and he is willing to wait for however long it takes to achieve her dreams.

==Production==
In December 2002, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Lionsgate Films would co-produce &quot;The Prince and the Freshman&quot;, a romantic comedy set to be directed by Martha Coolidge and star Julia Stiles. The film was the first project from Sobini Films, founded by Mark Amin following his sale of Trimark Pictures to Lionsgate, and was developed from an idea by Amin with Katherine Fugate writing the initial script. Susan Sarandon was initially in talks to play Rosalind, Queen consort of Denmark. 

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on March 30, 2004, in the United States by Hollywood Records.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;&#x27;s David Sterritt gave the film a positive review, calling it &quot;quite appealing, thanks to good-humored acting and to Martha Coolidge&#x27;s quiet directing style.&quot; Meanwhile, Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, calling it &quot;a blandly diverting, chastely conceived and grammatically challenged fairy tale&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; said that &quot;The Prince &amp; Me&quot; was overall &quot;well-meaning, cute, sweet&quot; but that the film could have been improved with &quot;a bit more quirkiness and a little less formula.&quot;

<doc id="1096953" wikidata="Q951594" url="?curid=1096953" title="Morgan Robertson">
<text>Morgan Andrew Robertson (September 30, 1861 - March 24, 1915) was an American author of short stories and novels, and the self-proclaimed inventor of the periscope.

==Early life==
Robertson was the son of Andrew Robertson, a ship captain on the Great Lakes, and Amelia (née Glassford) Robertson.

==Career==

Morgan went to sea as a cabin boy and was in the merchant service from 1876 to 1899, during which time he was promoted eventually to first mate. Tired of life at sea, he studied jewelry-making at Cooper Union in New York City and worked for 10 years as a diamond setter. When that work began to impair his vision, he began writing sea stories, his work being published in such popular magazines as &quot;McClure&#x27;s&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Robertson never made much money from his writing, a circumstance that distressed him greatly. Nevertheless, beginning with the early 1890s his main source of income was as a writer and he enjoyed the company of other bohemian-style artists and writers in New York.

===&quot;Futility&quot;===

Robertson is known best for his short novel &quot;Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan&quot;, first published in 1898. This story features an enormous British passenger liner named the SS &quot;Titan&quot;, which, deemed to be unsinkable, carries an insufficient number of lifeboats. On a voyage during the month of April, the &quot;Titan&quot; hits an iceberg and sinks in the North Atlantic Ocean, resulting in the loss of almost everyone on board. There are many close similarities with the real-life sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot;. The book was published 14 years before the actual &quot;Titanic&quot;, carrying an insufficient number of lifeboats, hit an iceberg on the night of April 14, 1912, and sank in the North Atlantic Ocean, killing most of the people on board. The similarities between the fictional &quot;Titan&quot; and the real &quot;Titanic&quot; have caused comment ever since the tragedy.

===Other works===
In 1905, Robertson&#x27;s book &quot;The Submarine Destroyer&quot; was published. It described a submarine that used a device known as a periscope. Despite Robertson&#x27;s later claims that he had &quot;invented&quot; a prototype periscope himself (and was refused a patent), Simon Lake and Harold Grubb had perfected the model used by the U.S. Navy by 1902, three years before Robertson&#x27;s &quot;prescient&quot; novel.

In 1914, in a volume that also contained a new version of &quot;Futility&quot;, Robertson included a short story named &quot;Beyond The Spectrum&quot;, which described a future war between the United States and the Empire of Japan, a popular subject at the time. Japan does not declare war but instead ambushes United States ships &quot;en route&quot; to the Philippines Islands and Hawaii; an invasion fleet about to begin a surprise attack on San Francisco is stopped by the hero using the weapon from a captured Japanese vessel. The title refers to an ultraviolet searchlight used by the Japanese, but invented by the Americans, to blind American crews.

Robertson authored &quot;Primordial&quot; / &quot;Three Laws and the Golden Rule&quot;, a novella about shipwrecked children growing up together and becoming enamored of each other on a desert island. Fans of Edgar Rice Burroughs acknowledge Robertson&#x27;s contribution to the works of Henry De Vere Stacpoole, particularly &quot;The Blue Lagoon&quot;. They believe that both Robertson&#x27;s and Stacpoole&#x27;s writings influenced Burroughs&#x27; creation of &quot;Tarzan of the Apes&quot;.

==Death==
On the afternoon of March 24, 1915, Robertson was found dead in his room at the Alamac Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was 53 years old. It was believed initially that he died of an overdose of paraldehyde, which he was taking as a sleep aid, however a physician stated that heart disease was the cause.

<text>Elvan Abeylegesse (also formerly: Hewan Abeye (አልቫን አበይለገሠ, Amharic) and Elvan Can (Turkish); born 11 September 1982) is an Ethiopian-born Turkish middle and long-distance running athlete who competes over distances from 1500 metres up to the marathon, and also in cross country. She is the former world record-holder for the 5000 metres, at 14:24.68 minutes.

In August 2015, the Turkish Athletics Federation confirmed that an anti-doping test taken during the 2007 World Championships in Athletics had been retested and found to be positive for a controlled substance, and that the athlete had been temporarily suspended pending retesting of her &#x27;B-sample&#x27;. On 29 March 2017, IAAF confirmed the positive test, expunged her results from 25 August 2007 until 25 August 2009 (thereby stripping her of the two silver medals she had won at the 2008 Olympic Games), and banned her from athletics for two years.

==Early life and career==
Abeylegesse was born Hewan Abeye on 11 September 1982 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and raised with her seven brothers and sisters. She began her career running cross country. In 1999, she started for the Ethiopian junior team at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Belfast, Northern Ireland and finished ninth. There, she was invited to a meeting in Istanbul, Turkey. She decided to move to Turkey and became a Turkish citizen after marrying a Turkish national. She took the name Elvan Can. Later she divorced and took the name Elvan Abeylegesse.

Registered in the Enka Sports Club in Istanbul, she is coached by Ertan Hatipoglu, a former triple jumper of Turkish origin from Bulgaria.

===Career highlights===
Abeylegesse&#x27;s career in the international arena began at the age of 18 in Grosseto, Italy in 2001 by winning the European 3000 m and 5000 m titles, setting a national record for Turkey. She became a world leader with a time of 8:31:94 in the 3000 m in Brussels, Belgium in 2002 and with a time of 3:58.38 in the 1500 m in Moscow, Russia in 2004.

Abeylegesse has been a scholarship holder with the Olympic Solidarity program since August 2002.

At the Evergood Bergen Bislett Games in Norway on 11 June 2004, the sixth meeting of TDK Golden League, Abeylegesse broke the women&#x27;s 5000 m world record, which had belonged to Chinese runner Jiang Bo since 1997 (14:28.09), improving the mark by over three seconds to 14:24.68. She became the first Turkish athlete ever to set a world record.

On 3 June 2006 her record time was beaten by Ethiopian Meseret Defar, who ran in 14:24.53 in New York City.

She ran at the inaugural World 10K Bangalore race in 2008 and finished in a dead heat with Grace Momanyi, with both runners eventually being declared joint victors.

She was the 2010 recipient of the Pierre de Coubertin World Fair Play Trophy, an annual award given by the International Fair Play Committee. She had lent a pair of running shoes to competitor Meselech Melkamu just moments before the beginning of the 10,000 metres final at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Having forgotten to bring her shoes to the track, Melkamu went on to take the silver.

Abeylegesse won the 2010 edition of the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon in a time of 1:07:07. This was the fastest ever time for a woman in the half marathon race and made her the sixth fastest woman overall. She played down suggestions of a permanent switch to longer road races, however, saying a marathon debut would have to wait until after the 2012 London Olympics.

At the 2010 European Athletics Championships, Abeylegesse won gold in the 10,000 m, finishing in 31 minutes, 10.23 seconds On 28 July 2010, and she won the silver medal in 5000m finishing in 14 minutes, 54.44 seconds on 1 August 2010. She narrowly missed out on a medal at the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup, finishing two seconds behind Molly Huddle in the 5000 m.

She returned to action in 2012 after her pregnancy and made her debut over 20 km, finishing as runner-up at the 20 Kilomètres de Paris. She was also runner-up in the 15K section of the Istanbul Eurasia Marathon. She won the Nice Half Marathon in April 2013. On 17 November 2013 she became runner-up in the women&#x27;s category at the Istanbul Marathon with a time of 2:29:30.

===Doping ban===
In August 2015, the Turkish Athletics Federation confirmed that an anti-doping test taken during the 2007 World Championships in Athletics had been retested and found to be positive for a controlled substance, and that the athlete had been temporarily suspended pending retesting of her &#x27;B-sample&#x27;. If confirmed, Abeylegesse stood to lose her 2007 medal, and possibly other awards from that date. On 29 March 2017, IAAF confirmed the positive test, expunged her results from 25 August 2007 until 25 August 2009 (thereby stripping her of the two silver medals she had won at the 2008 Olympic Games), and banned her from athletics for two years.

==Personal life==
Abeylegesse married her longtime partner Semeneh Debelie in February 2011 and decided to take the season off due to pregnancy. In July 2011, she gave birth to a girl named Arsema.

<doc id="1096967" wikidata="Q495224" url="?curid=1096967" title="Edward Almond">
<text>Edward Mallory Almond (December 12, 1892 – June 11, 1979) was a senior United States Army officer who fought in World War I, World War II, where he commanded the 92nd Infantry Division, and the Korean War, where he commanded the U.S. X Corps.

==Early life and education==
Edward Mallory Almond was born on December 12, 1892, in Luray, Virginia. He was the first son of Walter, a farm equipment salesman, and Grace Popham Almond. Another boy, Malcolm, joined the family in 1895, as did a sister, Judy, in 1897. Young Almond, nicknamed &quot;Ned&quot; by his family, grew up being told stories by his paternal grandmother about the American Civil War. Almond&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Thomas Popham, along with his great-uncle, William Barton Mallory, had both served in the Confederate Army during the war. In Almond’s youth there were still many veterans of the Civil War all over Virginia although Almond himself stated in later life that neither his grandparents nor the older people who had been involved spoke much about the conflict. He did note, however, that there seemed to be an undertone of bitterness for having lost the war.

Of his early years, Michael E. Lynch states:

Always interested in the military, determined to be a professional soldier, and inspired throughout his life by the words of Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s, &quot;You may be whatever you resolve to be&quot;,
 Almond graduated from the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in June 1915. He graduated third in a class of sixty-five cadets. He was later commissioned as a first lieutenant in the United States Army on 30 November 1916. The United States entered World War I soon afterwards, in April 1917.

==World War I==
Almond served in France during the latter stages of the war, ending it as a major. He fought in the Meuse–Argonne offensive of late 1918 as the commander of the 12th Machine Gun Battalion of the 4th Division, commanded then by Major General George H. Cameron. During his service in France, he was wounded in action and received a Silver Star Citation (later upgraded to the Silver Star decoration). Of his being wounded, which occurred in early August 1918, he later wrote:

After being relieved from combat in the Meuse–Argonne, Almond&#x27;s division, the 4th, was transferred to the newly created Second Army in mid-October and Almond was preparing his battalion, which he assumed command of on October 1, for a huge new offensive scheduled for November 12, although the Armistice with Germany brought an end to this plan. The relatively short campaign in the Meuse−Argonne had cost the 4th Division dearly, with 45 officers being killed and 199 wounded, while another 1,120 enlisted men had been killed with a further 6,024 wounded. Almond&#x27;s battalion had suffered 190 casualties, 4 of them being officers. The next few months for Almond and his battalion were spent on occupation duty in Germany.

==Between the wars==
On returning to the United States after the war, Almond taught military science at Marion Military Institute from 1919 to 1924. He then attended the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning in Georgia after which he resumed teaching at Marion until 1928. He also taught at the Infantry School at Fort Benning, becoming acquainted with Lieutenant Colonel George C. Marshall, the assistant commandant of the school.

In 1930, Almond graduated from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. After a tour of duty in Philippines, where he commanded a battalion of Philippine Scouts, he attended the Army War College in 1934 after which he was attached to the Intelligence Division of the General Staff for four years. Having been promoted to lieutenant colonel on September 1, 1938, he attended the Army War College, Air Corps Tactical School, and finally the Naval War College, from which he graduated in 1940. Almond was then assigned to staff duty at VI Corps HQ, Providence, Rhode Island, receiving a promotion to the temporary rank of colonel on October 14, 1941.

==World War II==
Soon after the American entry into World War II, in December 1941, Almond was promoted to brigadier general on March 15, 1942 and was named assistant division commander (ADC) of the 93rd Infantry Division, a newly raised African-American formation, commanded at the time by Major General Charles P. Hall, and which was then based in Arizona.

Almond was for a time highly regarded by George C. Marshall, also a VMI graduate, who was now Army Chief of Staff. This regard accounted in part for Almond&#x27;s promotion to major general, on September 23, ahead of most of his peers and subsequent command of the 92nd Infantry Division, made of almost exclusively African-American soldiers, a position he held from its formation in October 1942 until August 1945. Almond, surprised to be given such an assignment, in later years speculated why he was selected for command of the 92nd, stating:

He led the division during its training in the United States and in combat in the final phases of the Italian campaign of 1944–1945. During its time in Italy the division, arriving piecemeal throughout the latter half of 1944, underwent several changes in its organization, and suffered a total of almost 3,000 casualties during the often bitter Italian fighting, all while forming part of the U.S. Fifth Army under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark and later Lucian Truscott.

Although Marshall picked Almond for this assignment because Marshall believed Almond would excel at this difficult assignment, the division performed poorly in combat with Almond blaming the division&#x27;s poor performance on its largely African-American troops, echoing the widespread prejudice in the segregated Army that blacks made poor soldiers—and went on to advise the Army against ever again using African-Americans as combat troops. Almond told confidants that the division&#x27;s poor combat record had cheated him of higher command.

==Occupation duty in Japan==
In 1946 Almond was transferred to Tokyo as chief of personnel at General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s headquarters, normally a dead-end job. Almond very effectively handled the sizable challenge of staffing the occupation forces in Japan as American forces rapidly demobilized, standing out among MacArthur&#x27;s lackluster staff. Having won MacArthur&#x27;s confidence as capable and loyal, Almond was the logical choice to become Chief of Staff in January 1949, when the incumbent, Paul J. Mueller, rotated home.

==Korean War and X Corps==
After the initial North Korean attack in June 1950, United Nations forces were forced to withdraw and eventually fell back to the Pusan Perimeter.

MacArthur decided to counterattack with an amphibious invasion at Inchon in November. The invasion force, consisting of the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division, was originally named &quot;X Force&quot; and was placed under the command of Almond. Because the name X Force was confusing to logistics officers, upon Almond&#x27;s suggestion, the formation was re-designated as X Corps. MacArthur split X Corps from the 8th Army, then placed Almond, who had no experience with amphibious operations, in command of the main landing force just before the landings.

Almond earned the scorn of Marine officers when, during the early phase of the Inchon landing, he asked if the amphibious tractors used to land the Marines could float. The invasion succeeded, but Almond did not pursue effectively and most of the routed North Korean Army escaped northwards.

During this time, Major General O. P. Smith, commander of the 1st Marine Division, which was part of X Corps (and therefore under Almond&#x27;s overall command) from October until December 1950 had many conflicts with Almond.

Almond also had a poor relationship with Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the 8th Army, and “his singularly unfortunate rivalry with Walker left an indelible stamp on what happened” in Korea.

Historians have criticized Almond for the wide dispersal of his units during the X Corps advance into north-eastern part of North Korea, in November–December 1950. This dispersal contributed to the defeat of X Corps by Chinese troops, including the destruction of Task Force Faith, and the narrow escape of the Marines at the Battle of Chosin Reservoir. Almond was slow to recognize the scale of the Chinese attack on X Corps, urging Army and Marine units forward despite the huge Chinese forces arrayed against them. Displaying his usual reckless boldness, he underestimated the strength and skill of the Chinese forces, at one point telling his subordinate officers &quot;The enemy who is delaying you for the moment is nothing more than remnants of Chinese divisions fleeing north. We&#x27;re still attacking and we&#x27;re going all the way to the Yalu. Don&#x27;t let a bunch of Chinese laundrymen stop you.&quot; As stated by a close associate: &quot;When it paid to be aggressive, Ned was aggressive. When it paid to be cautious, Ned was aggressive.&quot;

Despite these mistakes and partly due to his close relationship with MacArthur, the new Eighth Army commander Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway, who became the commander of the 8th Army following the death of Walker in December 1950, retained Almond as commander of X Corps. Ridgway admired Almond&#x27;s aggressive attitude, but felt he needed close supervision to ensure his boldness did not jeopardize his command. Almond and X Corps later took part in the defeat of the Chinese offensives during February and March 1951, as well as the Eighth Army&#x27;s counter-offensive, Operation Killer. Almond was promoted to Lieutenant general in February 1951.

Future general and secretary of state Alexander Haig served as aide-de-camp to Almond in the Korean War.

==Post Korea==
In July 1951, Almond was reassigned and became commandant of the United States Army War College.

He retired from the Army on 31 January 1953 and worked as an insurance executive until his death in 1979, aged 86.

He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia, near his son, Edward Mallory Almond Jr., a captain in the 157th Infantry Regiment, killed in action on March 19, 1945, in France.

== Orders, decorations and medals ==

===1st Distinguished Service Cross citation===
General Headquarters Far East Command: General Orders No. 43 (October 23, 1950)

CITATION:

The President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Major General Edward M. Almond (ASN: 0-466), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General of X Corps. Major General Almond distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea during the period from 15 to 25 September 1950. During the seizure of Inchon, General Almond personally visited front line units, coordinated tactical efforts, and by his own fearless example aided them in seizing assigned objectives. Following the fall of Inchon, General Almond personally led his troops in their rapid drive through enemy-held territory to seize Seoul, and to speed the disintegration of the enemy forces. During the assault of the Han River, he moved to a forward position well beyond the line of friendly forces to observe and control the river crossing. Despite heavy enemy mortar fire directed at him, General Almond remained to supervise the air and artillery support which was protecting the first units of the Seventh Infantry Division crossing the river. Disregarding enemy mine fields and sniper fire, he proceeded to the crossing site to direct fire of amphibious tanks neutralizing enemy opposition which was impeding our crossing. By his inspirational leadership, his complete indifference to danger, and personal control of the battlefield, General Almond quickly concluded tactical operations which destroyed the enemy forces in the X Corps zone of action and saved countless lives in the forces under his command.

===2nd Distinguished Service Cross citation===
Headquarters, Eighth U.S. Army, Korea: General Orders No. 362 (May 28, 1951)

CITATION:

The President of the United States of America, under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Service Cross to Lieutenant General Edward M. Almond (ASN: 0-466), United States Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding General, X Corps. Lieutenant General Almond distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces during the massive offensive by three known Communist Armies against the X Corps, during the period from 16 through 25 May 1951. General Almond personally directed the historic defense which contained this attack and resulted in crushing losses in enemy manpower and materiel. During this period General Almond distinguished himself by countless acts of individual heroism as well as providing the inspiration, leadership and tactical skill which contributed materially the success of this operation. On 19 May 1951, while reconnoitering enemy positions in a light aircraft, he observed 250 enemy at a point forward of a friendly tank patrol. General Almond landed his plane by the tank column and sent the tank platoon leader in his aide&#x27;s plane to observe the enemy group. While with the tank column the enemy set up a machine gun within 500 yards of his position. Without regard for hostile fire from this gun, he directed tank fire which silenced the weapon. The tank platoon went on to destroy the 250 enemy. On 21 May 1951, General Almond made an aerial reconnaissance before a tank column operating at Soksa-ri, Korea. While flying low over this area, General Almond received intense automatic-weapons fire. Again, without regard for personal safety, he located these weapons and personally directed their destruction. Again on 25 May 1951, he made four flights in an unarmed light plane through the enemy-held mountain pass between Hangye and the Umyang bridgehead on the Seyang River. Despite intense enemy small-arms and friendly artillery fire, he returned time and again to insure proper command and liaison between friendly forces operating at both ends of the pass. These specific acts, as well as countless visits to forward-most command posts, provided the inspiration and forceful leadership essential at this critical time.

==In popular culture==

<text>State Highway 360 (SH 360) is a north–south freeway in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex in the U.S. state of Texas. It runs north from an at-grade intersection with US 287 in Mansfield, near the Ellis-Johnson county line to a partial interchange with SH 121 in Grapevine, near Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The highway serves as a local north–south route running through the center of the metroplex, linking together the southern and northern suburbs to the core. Between US 287 and Camp Wisdom Road/Sublett Road, SH 360 follows a pair of frontage roads along a four-lane tollway known as the 360 Tollway, a tollway operated by the NTTA. Between Camp Wisdom Road/Sublett Road and SH 121, SH 360 follows a toll-free freeway maintained by TxDOT.

The highway was opened in several stages throughout its existence. The first portion of the highway was designated on November 30, 1955, between US 80 (now SH 180) and SH 183. Newer portions of the highway were opened between 1960 and 2003. The 360 Tollway was opened in 2018, and is eventually planned to extend southward to a terminus at US 67 in Venus.

==Route description==
SH 360 begins as a pair of frontage roads at its southern terminus at an at-grade intersection with US 287 in Mansfield, near the Ellis-Johnson county line. North of its intersection with US 287, SH 360 expands into a pair of free two-lane frontage roads along a four-lane toll road, the 360 Tollway, which continues north for . In southwest Grand Prairie, SH 360 becomes a toll-free freeway at an intersection with Sublett Road/Camp Wisdom Road.
From there, the freeway proceeds north through Arlington near its boundary with Grand Prairie, where it interchanges with I-20 and then meets I-30. However, SH 360 and I-30 are not directly connected. As a legacy of the original toll road design of I-30 (formerly the Dallas-Fort Worth Turnpike), the highways connect only indirectly using long access roads that cross surface streets at lighted intersections.

From I-30, SH 360 then continues north beyond Arlington, interchanging with SH 183 near Euless. From the SH 183 interchange, the freeway continues north-northwest through Euless and into Grapevine, following the western boundary of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. SH 360 terminates at its northern terminus at a partial interchange with SH 121 in Grapevine.

==History==
SH 360 was constructed in different stages over the course of several decades. SH 360 was designated on November 30, 1955, from SH 183 south to US 80 (now SH 180). SH 360 was extended south in various stages, first to Spur 303 on July 25, 1960, I-20 on July 30, 1965, US 287 on June 10, 1966, and US 67 on August 26, 1969. SH 360 was extended north from SH 183 to SH 121 on May 6, 1969. For the most part, each section&#x27;s frontage roads were built first, handling all of the traffic years before the actual freeway portion was completed (or even begun). Similarly, the interchanges at I-20, I-30, and SH 183 were in place long before the freeway lanes were completed.

The indirect interchange between SH 360 and I-30 is a relic back from when I-30 existed as the Dallas/Fort Worth Turnpike. In order to direct traffic through toll booths, the interchange was designed so that any traffic moving from between the freeways were routed through one common, bi-directional ramp. This was done as a cost-saving measure, as it required fewer toll booths. The toll booths were removed in 1977, but the complex access road system remained.

South of SH 183, SH 360 was previously known as Watson Road. The segment through Arlington is also officially designated as the &quot;Angus G. Wynne Freeway&quot; (after the founder of Six Flags); however, neither the official designation nor the older Watson Road name are locally used, and the road is generally called &quot;360&quot;.

===360 Tollway===
The southernmost segment of SH 360 between US 287 in Mansfield and Camp Wisdom Road/Sublett Road in Grand Prairie was built between 1994 and 2003 as a pair of separated frontage roads, with space reserved between them for main freeway lanes to be added to meet future traffic needs. As traffic along the corridor grew, the SH 360 frontage lanes became increasingly congested. Local and state leaders began studying the construction of SH 360 as a freeway between the existing frontage roads in a project that became known as &quot;360 South&quot;. On January 25, 2013, TxDOT and the NTTA approved a deal to construct the extension as a four-lane toll road, the 360 Tollway, in a public–public partnership, with TxDOT performing the design and construction and the NTTA managing the completed freeway as part of its tollway system. Construction on the tollway began in November 2015. A ceremonial groundbreaking for construction of the 360 South toll road was held on October 21, 2015. The first phase of the project, which was planned to build two grade-separated toll lanes in each direction, was estimated to cost $330 million. The tollway opened to drivers on May 11, 2018, and became NTTA&#x27;s newest toll road. In the future, the toll road may be expanded to four lanes in each direction. The toll road has two names: the portion between US 287 and the Mansfield city limit is named the Senator Chris Harris Memorial Highway after the local legislator who aided the extension, and the portion from the Mansfield city limit to Camp Wisdom/Sublett Road is named the Rosa Parks Memorial Highway in memory of the late civil rights figure. The project cost a total of $340 million. Driving the entire length of the tollway costs $1.62 for TollTag users and $2.44 for nonusers, with drivers being billed via mail.

===I-30 interchange rebuild===
The former trumpet interchange between SH 360 and I-30 in Arlington became a major bottleneck, compounded by the fact that it intersected with surface streets and was located near major tourist attractions, including Six Flags Over Texas, Globe Life Field, Choctaw Stadium &amp; AT&amp;T Stadium. In November 2014, the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) announced that it would conduct an environmental study on a potential $200 million rebuild of the interchange. The rebuild would offer direct connections between SH 360 and I-30 for the first time. In March 2015, TxDOT approved spending $254 million on the stack interchange project, which would also include improvements to nearby Six Flags Drive. Ground broke on March 2, 2016, and was estimated to be completed in fall 2020 for $233 million. Construction was completed on December 21, 2023, with the interchange being open to traffic in all directions.

==Future==
The NTTA&#x27;s future plans for SH 360 include another extension of the toll road, which would run from the current SH 360 southern terminus in Mansfield to US 67 in Venus.

<text>Marvin Mandel (April 19, 1920 – August 30, 2015) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 56th Governor of Maryland from January 7, 1969, to January 17, 1979, including a one-and-a-half-year period when Lt. Governor Blair Lee III served as the state&#x27;s acting Governor from June 1977 to January 15, 1979 while Mandel was in federal prison for mail fraud and racketeering. He was a member of the Democratic Party, as well as Maryland&#x27;s first, and to date, only Jewish governor.

Before he became the state&#x27;s Governor, Mandel had been Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1964 to 1969 and a delegate since 1952.

Mandel was elected as Governor of Maryland on January 7, 1969, by the joint vote of both houses of the Maryland General Assembly due to the approaching vacancy created by the election of Spiro T. Agnew, the incumbent governor, as Vice President of the United States, as there was no lieutenant governor at the time to succeed to the governorship, as in most other states. Such an office was created by amendment in 1970.

== Early life ==
Mandel was born and raised in a Jewish family in Baltimore and attended the Baltimore City Public Schools, graduating from the Baltimore City College, which was a citywide, all-male institution that served as an early model of a college prep, specialized &quot;magnet&quot; school that developed and became popular in American public education forty years later. Mandel received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Maryland at College Park in 1939 and a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Maryland Law School in 1942, also receiving an honorary prize for his part in a school practice court honor case.

== Political career ==

Mandel was first elected to public office in the Maryland House of Delegates in 1952, representing northwest Baltimore. Mandel served several terms throughout the tumultuous events and urban politics of the 1950s and early &#x27;60s when civil rights was on the state&#x27;s front burner, and was finally chosen as Speaker of the House of Delegates in January 1963 and served in that position until January 1969. Speaker Mandel was first elected Governor and then sworn in by the legislative members of both houses in a joint session of the General Assembly in January 1969, upon the resignation of Governor Agnew, who was sworn in as vice president later that month. In his short inaugural speech to the legislators, he famously predicted his method and attitude towards the powers of his office putting aside the indirect and unusual way he came to the executive office and the idea of serving as an &quot;acting governor&quot;, from the formerly opposing party, saying, &quot;Make no mistake about it, we intend to govern!&quot;. After serving 23 months (almost two years of the unfinished Agnew term), he was duly further elected by the entire Maryland state body of voters in a regular gubernatorial election for a full four-year term in November 1970, and re-elected in a state election in November 1974.

=== Governor ===

Mandel&#x27;s executive administration was notable for many reasons. While he was governor, the executive branch of the Maryland state government was reorganized, combining the recent 20th-century growth of commissions, boards, offices, bureaus and agencies into twelve departments headed by supervising secretaries with several administrative levels in each executive department. Each secretary and their assistants and deputies reported directly to the governor and their chief-of-staff, reflecting the current American federal presidency and presidential cabinet system.

Additionally, the mass-transit system of Maryland was established and fostered under Mandel, enacting plans begun back in 1969 for the establishment of two urban subway networks. The first such rail network was for the Baltimore metropolitan area and its two adjoining suburban counties of Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County), and the second was for the National Capital area of Washington, D.C. (comprising several northern Virginia counties, and the Maryland suburban counties of Montgomery and Prince George&#x27;s Counties).

A statewide public school construction program initiative for Baltimore and the 23 counties of Maryland to be equalized and fully funded by the State was undertaken while Mandel was governor. Accordingly, students in kindergarten or first grade would begin their public education through to high school with equally adequate buildings, supplies and teachers.

The additional executive departmental reorganization and structure simplified the state government. Although narrowly rejected by state voters in a 1968 referendum (because of several large controversial proposals), many of the proposed charter&#x27;s other more generally acceptable provisions and reorganizations were later pushed past the legislature by the new Mandel administration and enacted into law and policy by the voters in several special elections/referendums and the edicts of the Mandel and later Hughes and Schaefer administrations. This included the reorganized four-level state court system.

Other similar administrative organizations and efficiencies were reflected in the various other departments as they were set up and took shape with the various &quot;administrations&quot;, authorities&quot; and &quot;offices&quot; arrayed beneath the state secretaries in the governor&#x27;s new cabinet, including newer unprecedented departments such as the environment, general services, public safety and correctional services, and natural resources.

Mandel&#x27;s idea to grow Maryland business and create more jobs was to attract existing overseas companies to the state. In 1972, Mandel selected Philip Kapneck, a local businessman, to start Maryland&#x27;s International Business efforts by opening an office in Brussels, Belgium. In 1974, Mandel appointed Kapneck as Maryland Trade Ambassador. Mandel&#x27;s initiative was so successful that over the next 40 years, his Trade Ambassador attracted hundreds of businesses, creating more than a hundred thousand jobs.

==Legal controversy==

Mandel was convicted in 1977 along with five co-defendants of mail fraud and racketeering. The charges stemmed from what prosecutors said was a complicated scheme in which Mandel was given money and favors for vetoing one bill and signing another to help his friends make money on a race track deal. On June 4, 1977, he notified Lieutenant Governor Blair Lee III that Lee would have to serve as &quot;Acting Governor of Maryland&quot; until further notice. Lee continued to serve as &quot;Acting Governor&quot; until January 15, 1979, when Mandel rescinded his letter appointing Lee as &quot;Acting Chief Executive&quot; (just two days before the expiration of his second full term) on the basis of his overturned previous legal conviction and the neutral legal opinions on the status of his appeal case, that the governor was now eligible to re-assume the powers of his office previously delegated to Lee, even at that late date.

Mandel had already served nineteen months of his original sentence in the low-security federal prison camp at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, before having his sentence commuted by President Ronald Reagan in 1981.

Based on the reasoning of an opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court, a U.S. District Court judge overturned the former governor&#x27;s conviction in 1987. A year after that, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the final decision, ending the long legal and political saga.

In addition, in 1980, Mandel&#x27;s administrative aide Maurice R. Wyatt, Maryland District Court Judge Allen B. Spector, and State Health Department director Donald H. Noren were tried and convicted by Judge James Macgill on bribery charges related to payments for land development and septic tank installation moratoriums. Although not connected with Gov. Mandel&#x27;s personal integrity and administration, these additional trials and convictions cast a pall on an otherwise overwhelming record of positive accomplishments in Maryland during the Mandel years.

Mandel&#x27;s official gubernatorial portrait was not hung in the governor&#x27;s Reception Room of the Maryland State House, the historic state capitol, with the most recent occupants of the office, until 1993, fourteen years after he left the executive chair and two administrations had intervened.

== Personal life ==

Mandel married Barbara Oberfeld (his first wife) on June 8, 1941, at age 22 and later had two children, Gary and Ellen. Mandel announced through his press office on July 3, 1973, that he was leaving his wife of 32 years to marry the woman he loved, Jeanne Blackistone Dorsey. In 1974, after temporarily moving out of the governor&#x27;s mansion into a small Annapolis apartment and separating from his first wife, Mandel later obtained a decree of divorce from Oberfeld, who had remained in the mansion and attempted to continue to act as &quot;First Lady&quot; and maintain a domestic life. After finally coming to a legal and domestic agreement, Oberfeld left and moved to her own quarters. Thereafter, Mandel soon married Dorsey, who occasionally entertained and performed some official functions as &quot;First Lady&quot; of the State in the later Mandel administration. Dorsey died on October 6, 2001, after 27 years of marriage to Mandel.

Mandel lived briefly in Arnold, Maryland, and lived and practiced law in Annapolis.

Mandel served as the chairman of the governor&#x27;s Commission on the Structure and Efficiency of State Government, beginning in 2003. He was also a member of the Board of Regents for the University System of Maryland from 2003 through 2009.

Mandel died on August 30, 2015, at the age of 95 in Compton, Maryland. After lying in state at the Maryland State House, a funeral service was held in Pikesville, and he was interred at Lakemont Memorial Gardens in Davidsonville, Maryland. A Fall 2017 issue of his law school&#x27;s magazine reported that Mandel had since been inducted into the Jewish Community Center of Greater Baltimore Hall of Fame.

<text>The NCTE George Orwell Award for Distinguished Contribution to Honesty and Clarity in Public Language (the Orwell Award for short) is an award given since 1975 by the Public Language Award Committee of the National Council of Teachers of English. It is awarded annually to &quot;writers who have made outstanding contributions to the critical analysis of public discourse.&quot;

Noam Chomsky, Donald Barlett, and James B. Steele are the only recipients to have won twice.

Its negative counterpart, awarded by the same body, is the Doublespeak Award, &quot;an ironic tribute to public speakers who have perpetuated language that is grossly deceptive, evasive, euphemistic, confusing, or self-centered.&quot;

<text>The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) is a United States professional organization dedicated to &quot;improving the teaching and learning of English and the language arts at all levels of education. Since 1911, NCTE has provided a forum for the profession, an array of opportunities for teachers to continue their professional growth throughout their careers, and a framework for cooperation to deal with issues that affect the teaching of English.&quot; In addition, the NCTE describes its mission as follows:

The NCTE is involved in publishing journals (such as &quot;College Composition and Communication&quot; and &quot;College English&quot;) and books that address the concerns of English language arts educators. Since the 1970s, it has issued annual Doublespeak Awards and Orwell Awards. It also issues the NCTE Intellectual Freedom Award.

==History==
As stated on the official NCTE website, the National Council of Teachers of English was founded in 1911 by a group of educators in Chicago, Illinois, known as the English Round Table of the National Education Association. This group wanted to create a professional response to changing needs and values regarding education, particularly English language education. The impetus for this early effort was a concern that school curricula were becoming too narrow and were incapable of addressing the needs of an increasingly diverse student population. A special committee was formed to address these issues. Since this time the NCTE has provided a forum for English teaching professionals to continue their professional growth throughout their careers, in addition to providing a framework for cooperative action pertaining to issues that affect the instruction of English.

These concerned educators at first set themselves a limited task: to explore the problems arising from a rigid, narrowly defined approach to English language instruction. Soon, however, it became apparent that more was needed, and that only a national professional organization would have the ability to affect policy decisions.

By 1919, the original investigatory committee had grown large enough to become such an organization. Because of its open-door policy regarding membership, the NCTE from the first maintained a divisional structure, with separate groups representing groups based on grade levels, divided up into elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educators.

By 1948, the simple divisions based on grade level were inadequate, and the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) was formed to address the special needs of communication and composition teachers at the university and community college level. This reliance on committee organization proved to be extremely useful, for it permitted interested groups to concentrate their focus on particular issues or trends. Membership grew dramatically in the second half of the twentieth century, and over the years new committees were formed, leading to the five-conference structure in place at the beginning of the twenty-first century.

In 1954, the organization&#x27;s president was Lou L. LaBrant, who lived to be 103 and taught for 70 years.

=== Structure ===
NCTE offers its members opportunities to grow professionally by interacting with colleagues in all sides of English teaching. Individuals belong to any of four broad sections of membership – Elementary, Middle, Secondary or College. They may also join other groups centered on various teaching specialties within English, each with its own journal, meetings, and projects.

Major interest groups, called Conferences, serve teachers of college writing and rhetoric; teacher educators in higher education and in-service posts; teachers with an interest in whole language; and English department chairs, K-12 supervisors, and other English instruction leaders. Assemblies are informal special interest groups, ranging in focus from computers in English to research, which meet at NCTE conventions. A notable example of this last sort of group is the Children&#x27;s Literature Assembly, which publishes the &quot;Journal of Children&#x27;s Literature&quot;.

Commissions monitor and report on trends and issues in the teaching of language, composition, literature, reading, and media. Nearly 50 committees and task forces carry out projects on issues and topics in the teaching of English, among them testing and evaluation, censorship, instructional technology, response to literature, teacher preparation and certification, and English in urban schools.

In addition to commissions, standing committees are charged with focusing on issues and/or areas of continued concern that affect the English language area of study. There are three standing committees; the committee against censorship, the committee on diversity and inclusivity, and the committee on global citizenship.

===Committee Against Censorship===
The committee against censorship&#x27;s charge is &quot;to solicit and receive reports of censorship incidents from NCTE members, constituent groups, and sources outside the Council; to serve as a resource on current patterns of censorship; to continue to raise awareness of censorship issues; to serve as an advisory committee to NCTE Headquarters considering the kinds of support and services that an Intellectual Freedom/Anti-Censorship Center could provide; to promote policies for literature adoption that allay the possibility of censorship; to help NCTE develop rationales for the teaching of controversial texts, and to develop a white paper that further explores students&#x27; right to write and all of its implications.

===Committee on Diversity and Inclusivity===
The committee on diversity and inclusivity&#x27;s charge is to &quot;advise NCTE on efforts to foster diversity and inclusivity among members and potential members, including (but not restricted to) in terms of race, ethnicity, sex and gender identity, age, economic status, physical ability, and teaching circumstances. Work in concert with the Executive Committee and Executive Director on specific assignments that ensure equity and diversity within membership. Identify strategies to employ the resources and values of diversity and inclusivity to advance NCTE&#x27;s mission for all members, our students, and our constituencies. Provide annual or biannual analyses of the effectiveness of NCTE diversity and inclusivity initiatives (programs, awards, events, etc.), and to make recommendations based on that analysis. Identify existing research or resources that can support a diverse NCTE membership and their professional needs. Identify gaps or opportunities that might be met with new research or resources.&quot;
===Committee on Global Citizenship===
The committee on global citizenship&#x27;s charge is &quot;to promote interest and knowledge of global connections and issues across the Council, including convention sessions, publications, social media, and Council projects; To promote discussions of the learning needs of students in schools and colleges who come from global contexts and of instructional strategies for teachers of these students; To encourage discussions of the teaching of English and world Englishes in global contexts as well as in North American schools and colleges with increasingly globally diverse students; To provide awareness of literacy education in global contexts in order to provide a mutual exchange of pedagogical ideas and issues; To encourage the integration of global and international literature and of strategies for intercultural understanding within schools and colleges; and to engage the Council in an exploration of the changing needs of literacy teaching and learning in an increasingly global society and as members of a broader global community.&quot;

===Awards===
The NCTE offers several awards for organizations performing work consistent with NCTE&#x27;s mission. These awards include:
*Children&#x27;s Book and Poetry Awards
*Diversity Awards
*Educator Awards
*Leadership Awards 
*Research Awards
*Student Writing Awards
*Publication Awards

==Strategic governance==
In November 2003, the NCTE Executive Committee adopted a new model of policy-oriented style of governance for the council. They studied the meaning and ramifications of issues for the organization as a whole.

==Journals==
NCTE published the following journals:
* &quot;College Composition and Communication&quot;, journal of the Conference on College Composition and Communication

===&quot;Teaching English in the Two-Year College&quot;===

&quot;Teaching English in the Two-Year College&quot; is an official publication of the council and is aimed at teachers and scholars in two-year colleges. The peer-reviewed academic journal covers a range of topics related to the teaching of English language arts at the college level, including all areas of composition (basic, first-year, and advanced); business, technical, and creative writing; and the teaching of literature, along with other areas of professional concern. It sometimes publishes special issues devoted to specific themes. It is abstracted and indexed by EBSCO databases and the Modern Language Association. It was established in 1973 and the following persons are or have been editors-in-chief:

==Political activities==
NCTE is engaged in a variety of political issues affecting English Education and does so primarily through Steering Committee on Social and Political Concerns (SLATE). According to the NCTE website, SLATE attempts to &quot;influence public attitudes and policy decisions affecting the teaching of English language arts at local, state, and national levels; to implement and publicize the policies adopted by NCTE. As part of its political action function, SLATE will serve as NCTE&#x27;s intellectual freedom network.&quot;

===NCTE and SLATE===
NCTE and Slate are involved in many political issues, some of which include:
* No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)
* Banned Books
* Striving Readers Act

==Present and future==
The NCTE currently has a reported 35,000 members and subscribers in the United States and internationally. This membership is composed of teachers and supervisors of English programs ranging from elementary, middle, and secondary schools to faculty in college and university English departments as well as teacher educators, local and state agency English specialists, and other professionals in directly related fields. Sponsoring over 120 regional, state, provincial, local, and student affiliates within the United States, Canada, and Asian countries, the NCTE continues its rapid annual growth.

<text>Hayden Vernon Foxe (born 23 June 1977) is an Australian former professional soccer player who works as assistant coach with the Australia men&#x27;s national soccer team. He played football as a centre-back at the top level in Germany, Japan, Belgium, England and Australia. Foxe represented his country at international level 11 times between 1998 and 2003.

==Club career==

===Europe===
Beginning his career at Sydney club Blacktown City he moved to Dutch club Ajax Amsterdam where he played from 1995–97. Foxe soon established a reputation as a talented young defender, earning a move to J1 League club Sanfrecce Hiroshima in 1998–99.

Becoming an important player both at club and international level, Foxe represented his country at the 1996 Summer Olympics and 2000 Summer Olympics. He impressed enough to earn a move to England&#x27;s West Ham United for the 2000–01 season. He was then immediately loaned to Belgian club Mechelen in order to build up his match fitness. Foxe returned to West Ham United in March, but struggled in the Premiership, losing his place when then manager Harry Redknapp left the club later that year.

After playing only 12 games for West Ham, he moved to Portsmouth (then managed by Harry Redknapp) for £400,000 in May 2002. Foxe was an important player as Portsmouth won the 2002–03 First Division title, and in doing so were promoted to the Premiership. He was a regular in Portsmouth&#x27;s side until a fractured bone in his foot ended his campaign at Christmas. He spent the rest of that season, as well as the 2004–05 season, rehabilitating.

New manager Alain Perrin elected not to renew his contract when it expired in June 2005, and he was released. Foxe returned to Australia to undergo an operation in an attempt to resolve his ongoing injury problems. Foxe trained with Leeds United during their 2006 pre-season campaign and signed a five-month permanent contract with the Yorkshire club on 11 August 2006.

Foxe attempted to rebuild his career at Leeds and since the departure of Kevin Blackwell, both care-taker manager John Carver and new manager Dennis Wise provided the Aussie with chances to perform. Foxe however only ultimately played a bit part in the 2006–07 season and was released at the end of the season when Leeds United were relegated to English League One. He scored one league goal during his time at Leeds, against Luton in a 5–1 defeat.

In 2007, he returned to Australia to play for Perth Glory in the A-League and missed the first half of the season due to a knee injury but returned later in the season to play the last six games of the 2007–08 season. After finishing the 2008–09 season with Glory, he has been released.

===Sydney FC===
On 7 January 2010, he was announced to have made a comeback to the A-League on a short-term injury replacement deal with Sydney FC. After his short term contract, he signed a one-year extension with Vítězslav Lavička noting how his presence late in the season was a crucial factor in Sydney&#x27;s end of season success, which will keep him at the club until the end of the 2010–11 A-League season. He was the vice captain.

Foxe announced his retirement from football at the end of the 2010–11 A-League season, deciding not to continue with Sydney FC for their Asian Champions League campaign, despite keen interest from coach Lavička for his services.

==International career==

===Youth===
Foxe played 1993 World Youth Championship Finals in Japan with the Australia U17 national team and at the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship in Malaysia with the U20 national team.

With the Australia U23 national team he participated in qualification for the 1996 Summer Olympics and he was a member of the squad at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.

===Senior===
Foxe was capped by the Australia national team.

==Personal life==
He is the brother of Jeremy Foxe &amp; Damien Foxe, who also played football.

<doc id="1096988" wikidata="Q700530" url="?curid=1096988" title="Battle of Cape St. George">
<text>The Battle of Cape St. George was a naval battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II fought on 25 November 1943, between Cape St. George, New Ireland, and Buka Island (now part of the North Solomons Province in Papua New Guinea). It was the last engagement of surface ships in the Solomon Islands campaign. During the engagement, a force of five US Navy destroyers led by Captain Arleigh Burke intercepted a similar sized Japanese force that was withdrawing from Buka towards Rabaul, having landed reinforcements on the island. In the ensuing fight, three Japanese destroyers were sunk and one was damaged, with no losses amongst the US forces.

==Background==
The Americans had landed Marines from the 3rd Marine Division around Cape Torokina on Bougainville Island on 1 November 1943. Judging the landings a ruse, and that the real Allied objective was the airfields around Buka Island to the north of Bougainville, the Japanese delayed launching a concerted counterattack on Cape Torokina, and instead determined to reinforce Buka. As a result, 920 Japanese Army troops were embarked on the destroyers , and under the command of Captain Katsumori Yamashiro and were sent to reinforce the garrison, escorted by the destroyers and under the command of Captain Kiyoto Kagawa. The convoy was spotted by reconnaissance aircraft, and the United States Navy sent Captain Arleigh Burke&#x27;s Destroyer Squadron 23, composed of Destroyer Division 45 (, , and ), under Burke&#x27;s direct command, and Destroyer Division 46 ( and ), under Commander Bernard Austin to intercept it. Meanwhile, nine PT boats under Commander Henry Farrow moved into the Buka Passage to engage the Japanese if Burke&#x27;s force was unable to make contact.

==Battle==

The Japanese battle plan divided their force into two columns, with the three transport destroyers trailing the two escort destroyers. The American battle plan also divided their force into two columns using tactics devised by Burke and first employed successfully by Commander Frederick Moosbrugger at the Battle of Vella Gulf the previous August. One column would make a torpedo attack while the other took up a supporting position ready to open gunfire as soon as the first column&#x27;s torpedo attack struck home.

The Japanese destroyers landed the 920 troops and supplies and embarked 700 Navy aviation personnel being withdrawn because Allied bombing had rendered the airfield at Buka non-operational. The Japanese force was returning to Rabaul when Farrow&#x27;s PT boats spotted four of the Japanese ships on their radar on 25 November 1943 just after midnight; however, the PT boats mistook the Japanese vessels for friendly forces and hove to further ashore. Two of the Japanese ships subsequently attacked the PT boats, firing on them and attempting to ram &quot;PT-318&quot;. They failed to score any hits, though, while one of the PT boats, &quot;PT-64&quot;, fired a torpedo which missed its target. Afterwards, the Japanese destroyers steamed west towards Cape St. George.

Around 01:41, Kagawa&#x27;s two screening destroyers were picked up by radar by Burke&#x27;s destroyers, which had moved into position between Cape St. George and Buka, with &quot;Dyson&quot; making contact first. Poor visibility prevented the Japanese from spotting the American ships in turn. Burke elected to use his own division for the torpedo attack. Superior radar allowed the American ships to approach within and launch their torpedoes at about 01:55 before the Japanese sighted them. &quot;Onami&quot; was hit by several torpedoes and sank immediately with all hands, including Kagawa. &quot;Makinami&quot; was hit by one torpedo and disabled.

Burke&#x27;s force established radar contact with the rest of the Japanese force at soon after launching their torpedoes and turned to pursue; Yamashiro&#x27;s three transport destroyers fled north, pursued by Burke&#x27;s division, while &quot;Converse&quot; and &quot;Spence&quot; from Austin&#x27;s division finished off the disabled &quot;Makinami&quot; with torpedoes and gunfire. During the chase, torpedoes fired by Japanese destroyers exploded in the wakes of the American destroyers. Burke&#x27;s three destroyers steadily gained on the three heavily laden Japanese destroyers, opening fire around 02:22, scoring several hits. &quot;Uzuki&quot; was hit by one dud shell and escaped without significant damage. &quot;Amagiri&quot; escaped untouched. Around 02:25, the Japanese ships split up and fled in different directions. Burke chose to pursue &quot;Yugiri&quot; with his entire force and sank her at about 03:28 after a fierce engagement.

==Aftermath==
By 03:45, Burke’s and Austin&#x27;s divisions had linked up, continuing to push north to pursue the withdrawing Japanese ships. Burke subsequently called off the attempt at 04:04, low on fuel and ammunition and needing to withdraw before daylight, when Japanese aircraft would likely begin operations to search for them. In the event, the only aircraft the US ships spotted once daylight came were friendly AirSols P-38 Lightnings.

The battle represented a significant victory for the Americans and was later described as an &quot;almost perfect action,&quot; for which Burke was awarded a Navy Cross. It was the final surface engagement of the Solomon Islands campaign and the last such action in the wider Pacific for nine months. Although the Japanese were able to land their troops and withdraw their supporting personnel, they lost three destroyers sunk and one damaged, without inflicting any losses on the American force. Amongst the Japanese crews, a total of 647 were killed. A total of 279 survivors from &quot;Yugiri&quot; were rescued by the Japanese submarine and 11 by the .

==Namesake==
The U.S. Navy guided-missile cruiser , in commission since 1993, was named for this battle.

<doc id="1097006" wikidata="Q1146729" url="?curid=1097006" title="Ferrari F355">
<text>The Ferrari F355 (Type F129) is a sports car manufactured by Italian car manufacturer Ferrari produced from May 1994 until 1999. The car is a heavily revised Ferrari 348 with notable exterior and performance changes. The F355 was succeeded by the all-new Ferrari 360 in 1999.

Design emphasis for the F355 was placed on significantly improved performance, as well as drivability across a wider range of speeds and in different environments (such as low-speed city traffic). 
== Specifications ==

Apart from the displacement increase from to , the major difference between the V8 engine in the 348 and F355 is the introduction of a 5-valve cylinder head. This new head design allowed for better intake permeability and resulted in an engine that was considerably more powerful, generating a maximum power output at 8,250 rpm and of at 6,000 rpm. The longitudinally mounted 90° V8 engine was stroked by 2 mm over the 348&#x27;s engine (77 mm rather than 75 mm), resulting in the small increase in displacement. Engine internals are produced using lightweight materials; the connecting rods are forged in Ti6-Al-4V titanium alloy. The engine&#x27;s compression ratio is 11:1 and employs the Bosch Motronic 2.7 engine control unit in the 1995 model year, later changed to the M5.2 in 1996 through end of production. The Motronic system controls the electronic fuel injection and ignition systems, with a single spark plug per cylinder. Engine lubrication is via a dry sump oiling system. The engine was designed by Paolo Martinelli.

The F355 addressed transmission issues that plagued the earlier models. A coolant heat-exchanger was installed which upon startup, warmed the gearbox oil quicker. A rod-driven actuation system, which replaces the 348&#x27;s cable operated system, was also added for precise gear shifts.

The frame is a steel monocoque with tubular steel rear sub-frame with front and rear suspensions using independent, unequal-length wishbones, coil springs over gas-filled telescopic shock absorbers with electronic control servos and anti-roll bars. The car allows selection between two damper settings, &quot;Comfort&quot; and &quot;Sport&quot;. The road-going models came with Pirelli tyres, size 225/40ZR 18 at the front and 265/40 ZR 18 at the rear. Although the F355 was equipped with power-assisted steering (intended to improve low-speed drivability relative to the outgoing 348), this could optionally be replaced with a manual steering rack setup by special order.

Aerodynamics for the car included over 1,300 hours of wind tunnel analysis. The car incorporates a nolder profile on the upper portion of the tail and a fairing on the underbody that generates downforce when the car is at speed.

The car&#x27;s standard seats are upholstered with hides from Connolly leather, and are fitted asymmetrically in the car; this results in the driver being slightly closer to the car&#x27;s centerline than the passenger.

At launch, the only model available was the Berlinetta. The Spider (convertible version), and the GTS (targa top model) were introduced in 1995. In 1997, the Formula One-style electrohydraulic-operated automated manual paddle-shift transmission was introduced and the cars equipped with this transmission were called 355 F1. The F355 was the last in the series of mid-engine Ferrari models with the Flying Buttress rear window, a lineage going back to the 1965 Dino 206 GT, unveiled at the Paris Auto Show.

The nomenclature does not follow the formula from the previous decades, i.e., engine capacity (in litres) followed by the number of cylinders (e.g. 246 = 2.4 litres, 6 cylinders, 308 = 3.0 litres, 8 cylinders, etc.). In naming the F355, Ferrari used engine capacity followed by the number of valves per cylinder (355 = 3.5 litre engine capacity and 5 valves per cylinder) to bring the performance advances introduced by a 5-valve per cylinder configuration into the forefront.

==Variants==
=== F355 Berlinetta ===

The Berlinetta was introduced in May 1994, as the first in a successful series of F355 models. Initially, the 6-speed manual was the only transmission available. However, in 1997, the Berlinetta was the first-ever road car to be equipped with the innovative F1-style gearbox management system. Derived directly from Formula 1, where it made its debut in 1989 resulting in a win at the Brazilian Grand Prix, the electro-hydraulic system was operated by paddles behind the steering wheel using the F355&#x27;s conventional 6-speed manual gearbox. The new transmission guaranteed faster gear changes, with the additional advantage that both of the driver&#x27;s hands could stay on the wheel at all times.

Ferrari produced 4,871 road-going Berlinetta models during the entire production run, of which 3,829 were equipped with the 6-speed manual and 1,042 with &quot;F1&quot; transmissions.

=== F355 Spider ===

The F355 Spider debuted in 1995, its Pininfarina-penned lines honed by 1,800 hours in the wind tunnel, resulted in a blend of elegant style and aerodynamic performance. For the first time on a Ferrari automobile, the automated manual soft-top was powered electronically. Initially, the Spider was offered with the 6-speed manual transmission. In 1997, the Spider was offered with the &quot;F1&quot; transmission available as an option. The Spider proved to be the second-most popular F355 model, with a total production of 3,717 units, of which 2,664 were produced with the 6-speed manual transmission and 1,053 were produced with the &quot;F1&quot; transmission.

=== F355 GTS ===

In 1995, Ferrari introduced the GTS model to the F355 family. The GTS model was based on the Berlinetta but offered a removable &quot;targa-style&quot; hardtop roof, which could be stored behind the seats. Other specifications were identical to the Berlinetta. A total of 2,577 GTS models were produced, with 2,048 delivered with the 6-speed manual transmission and another 529 with the &quot;F1&quot; transmission.

=== F355 Challenge ===
In 1995, Ferrari introduced a race-ready F355 Challenge model for use specifically in the Ferrari Challenge race series. The Ferrari F355 Challenge model was developed by starting with a standard Ferrari F355 Berlinetta and modifying it with a US$30,000 factory-to-dealer supplied kit. The initial 1995 cars came with factory fitted cage mounts and without carpets. Each year, the cars arrived with more and more factory fitted race parts, culminating in 1998 with full-evolution cars which were supplied as virtually complete race cars except for some parts such as the rear wing, which still needed to be fitted by the dealer.

The kit initially was more substantial than the 348 Challenge and the engine, gearbox, and shock-absorbers were sealed with special tags to prevent unauthorized modifications. The kit included the following components/modifications:
* Roll-cage
* Racing bucket seats
* Safety harnesses
* Fire extinguisher
* Engine cut-off switch
* Manual radiator fan control and upgraded fans
* Competition steering wheel
* Lightweight exhaust
* Rear wing
* Competition clutch
* Upgraded 14-inch Brembo brakes (carried over from the F40)
* 18-inch Speedline magnesium wheels
* Pirelli racing slicks
* Solid suspension bushings and competition springs
* Front and Rear brake cooling ducts
* Challenge black perforated rear grille (halfway through the 1995 season to get extra air through the engine-bay)
* Lightened front bumper
* Front and rear tow hooks

The F355 Challenge shares the same engine and physical dimensions as the standard F355 Berlinetta. 108 cars in total were produced, all of which were equipped with the 6-speed manual transmission. Although some sources indicate that over 300 cars were subject to the Challenge conversion, yet this claim remains unproven. There were 18 RHD cars imported by Ferrari UK and modified by MHT. A further 10 were sold to the rest of the RHD markets. Making the total number to only 28 RHD models. These RHD models become extremely rare and valuable. Some of these rare cars are located in Indonesia, Australia, Japan, and only one known example in South Africa. Each F355 Challenge has an emblem on the rear that specifically denotes the &quot;F355 Challenge.&quot;

=== Limited Edition Fiorano ===
For the 1999 model year, Ferrari introduced a limited production of F355 Spider models designated, &quot;Serie Fiorano&quot;. Launched in March 1999, this limited production run of 100 planned units (104 actually produced) included a number of enhancements increasing the track performance much closer to the Challenge versions:
* Competizione-derived Fiorano suspension pack, featuring wide track, stiffer springs, a thicker anti-roll bar 
* Drilled and ventilated brake discs and competition brake pads
* Competizione-sourced steering rack
* Challenge rear grilles and enameled Scuderia Ferrari shields
* Carbon-fibre inserts (normally only available as expensive special order options): centre console, door sills, and paddle-shifters
* Suede-covered steering wheel

There were 100 Serie Fiorano units delivered to the U.S. market, 74 with the &quot;F1&quot; paddle-shift transmission and 26 with the 6-speed manual. An additional 4 units were produced beyond the planned production for the U.S., with only 3 European models and one unit destined for South Africa. The American units were delivered with a numbered plaque affixed to the dashboard while the 3 Fioranos delivered to Europe had no numbered plaque.

====Serie Fiorano Chassis Numbers====
* 355 spider Fiorano F1 (US model) 74 ex (sn 115426 - 116799)
* 355 spider Fiorano manual (US model) 26 ex (sn 116291 - 116579)
* 355 spider Fiorano F1 (EURO model) 3 ex (sn 116194, 116201 and 116489)
* 355 spider Fiorano F1 (South Africa model) 1 ex (sn 115624)

=== Fiorano Handling Pack ===

Although not a limited edition model a &quot;Fiorano Handling Pack&quot; was offered as a track focused factory option upgrade to the F355 &amp; 355 F1 in Europe to road cars built in the final year of production - these featured upgrades straight from the Challenge Evo parts bin. The Fiorano Handling Pack (FHP) included – Quick steering rack &amp; pump, lowered ride height, uprated springs, wider track, thicker anti-roll bars, Challenge EVO suspension ECU and upgraded brake pads with red callipers and drilled discs specifically for the road car. 

The little known Ferrari F355 &quot;Fiorano&quot; was the first ‘Challenge’ inspired track focused V8 Ferrari road car.

So few buyers ordered their cars with the Fiorano Handling Package that less than 2% of production had this specified and only 0.3% were manual - In the UK only seven F355’s with a manual gearbox were delivered to the UK market. Just four Berlinettas&#x27;, Zero GTS and three Spiders. This makes a manual F355 Fiorano Berlinetta as rare as a Manual 599.

== Production ==
Total production of 11,273 units made the F355 the most-produced Ferrari at the time. This sales record would be surpassed by its successor, the 360 and later, the F430.

==Recall==
In November 2009, Ferrari recalled about 2,400 1995–99 355s and 355F1s in the United States because of improperly placed screw clamps that could damage the fuel-supply pipes and allow fuel to leak into the engine compartment. Ferrari learned of the problem when it was sued over a fire involving an injury to a driver.

<text>In law, a hearing is the formal examination of a case (civil or criminal) before a judge. It is a proceeding before a court or other decision-making body or officer, such as a government agency or a legislative committee.

==Description==
A hearing is generally distinguished from a trial in that it is usually shorter and often less formal.

During the course of litigation, oral arguments are presented in support of motions at hearings. The purpose of these arguments may be to resolve the case without further trial, such as through a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, or to decide discrete issues of law, such as the admissibility of evidence, which will determine how the trial proceeds. Limited evidence and testimony may also be presented at hearings to supplement the legal arguments.

==Types==
Terminology varies from country to country, and there are different types of hearings under different legal systems.

A preliminary hearing (also known as evidentiary hearing, probable cause hearing, and other variant terms) is a proceeding, after a criminal complaint has been filed by the prosecutor, to determine whether there is enough evidence to require a trial.

===Australia=== 
A hearing is a part of the court process in Australia. There are different types of hearing in a case. There may be several hearings, although not all may be scheduled. These include:

*court mentions, where a case first is heard in court; and/or
*directions hearing(s) (a brief hearing in front of a judge or commissioner); and
*a contest mention, where disputed issues are resolved, this is the part of the hearing where evidence may be adduced (the process of putting forward or presenting evidence or arguments for consideration by the court); a &quot;type of pre-trial hearing which aims to facilitate early guilty pleas and narrow the issues in dispute&quot;.

===United Kingdom===
A hearing is a part of the court process in England and Wales. The term &quot;rolled-up hearing&quot; is also used, referring to occasions when permission is considered for a procedural application on the basis that, if permission is granted, the substantive application will be heard immediately afterwards.

===United States===

*Congressional hearing
*Unofficial hearing
There are several different types of hearings in the US legal system, each serving a unique purpose. 

* Preliminary hearings are used to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to require a trial. In a preliminary hearing, a judge listens to arguments and evidence from both sides before deciding whether the case should proceed to trial.
* Motion hearings are held when a party asks the court to take a specific action in the case. For example, a party may request that certain evidence be excluded from trial or that a case be dismissed before trial. In a motion hearing, each side presents arguments and evidence to the judge, who then makes a decision based on the law and facts presented.
* Evidentiary hearings are used to resolve disputes related to evidence in a case. During an evidentiary hearing, parties present arguments and evidence related to the admissibility of certain evidence or the validity of expert testimony. The judge then makes a ruling on whether the evidence in question can be presented at trial.
* Depositions are another type of hearing commonly used in the US legal system. Depositions involve sworn testimony from a witness or party in a case, taken outside of court and recorded by a court reporter. Depositions are often used to gather information before trial or to impeach the credibility of a witness at trial.

In the mid-20th century, as a result of what has been called the &quot;due process revolution,&quot; a series of Supreme Court decisions expanded the rights of individuals in legal proceedings and required more formal procedures and protections.

One key decision during this period was &quot;Goldberg v. Kelly&quot; (1970), which involved a challenge to the system for terminating welfare benefits in New York. The Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that individuals have the opportunity to be heard and present evidence before their benefits are terminated.

The decision in &quot;Goldberg&quot; helped to establish the principle that many administrative decisions require some form of hearing or other procedure to ensure that individuals are not deprived of their rights without due process of law. It also illustrated that what constitutes a hearing can depend on the context. In &quot;Goldberg&quot;, the goal of a speedy decision was held to &quot;justify the limitation of the pre-termination hearing to minimum procedural safeguards&quot;, which included such basic matters as the right to appear and to cross-examine witnesses, but did not include &quot;a complete record and a comprehensive opinion&quot;. This has had a significant impact on the US legal system, leading to an increase in the number of hearings and other procedures required in a wide range of legal contexts.

<doc id="1097026" wikidata="Q5372259" url="?curid=1097026" title="Emily Litella">
<text>Emily Litella is a fictional character created and performed by comedian Gilda Radner in a series of appearances on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Based on a person in her early life, Emily Litella was a popular character in Radner&#x27;s comedy repertoire.

==Premise==
Emily Litella is an elderly woman with a hearing problem who appeared 26 times on &quot;SNL&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Weekend Update&quot; op-ed segment between November 15, 1975 (Season 1) and December 17, 1977 (Season 3). Attired in a frumpy dress, sweater and Lisa Loopner eyeglasses, Litella was introduced with professional dignity by the news anchors, who could sometimes be seen cringing slightly in anticipation of the malapropisms they knew would follow. These sketches were, in part, a parody of the Fairness Doctrine, which at the time required broadcasters in the United States to present opposing viewpoints on public issues.

Litella would peer through her reading glasses and, in the character&#x27;s high-pitched, warbly voice, would read a prepared statement in opposition to an editorial that the TV station had supposedly broadcast. Litella would become increasingly agitated as her statement progressed. Midway in her commentary, it became apparent to the anchor and the audience that Litella had misheard or misunderstood the subject of the editorial to which she was responding. A typical example:

The news anchor would interrupt Litella to point out her error, along the lines, &quot;That&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; penalty, Ms. Litella, not &quot;deaf&quot; ... &quot;death&quot;.&quot; Litella would wrinkle her nose, say something like, &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s very different,&quot; then meekly turn to the camera and say, smiling, &quot;Never mind!&quot;

When Litella played against news anchor Chevy Chase (whom she often called &quot;Cheddar Cheese&quot;), he would be somewhat sympathetic to her. After Chase left &quot;Saturday Night Life&quot;, Jane Curtin took over the anchor role and provided a more adversarial foil. Often, she would scold Litella, &quot;Every week you come on and you get it wrong,&quot; to which Litella would reply, &quot;Bitch!&quot;

==Appearances==

==History==
Radner based Litella on her childhood nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, known as &quot;Dibby&quot;, who was allegedly hard of hearing.
The running gag &quot;Never mind&quot; became a lighthearted catchphrase of the era.

In her first appearance on &quot;SNL&quot;, the character of Emily Litella was an author who appeared as an interview subject on a show called &quot;Looks At Books&quot;. Though she had the same wavery voice and somewhat frumpy wardrobe as she would in later episodes, Litella did not appear to have a hearing problem in this appearance. All but one of the subsequent &quot;SNL&quot; appearances by Litella were at the newsdesk, and featured the by-now much more familiar &quot;editorial reply&quot; iteration of the character. In the eleventh episode of season four, on February 10, 1979, with guest hostess Cicely Tyson, the final comedy sketch was called &quot;Emily Litellavision&quot;, and featured Litella hosting a staging of a song from &quot;Porky and Bess&quot;, her Porky Pig–based mis-hearing of &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot; by George and Ira Gershwin and DuBose Heyward, with Garrett Morris singing a song to Tyson with added stuttering, and the orchestra shown wearing pig masks.

Outside of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, Radner played the character briefly on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;. At the top of that episode, Miss Litella is discovered by stage manager Scooter, where she is vociferously complaining about the indignity of her appearing in something so silly as &quot;The Muffin Show&quot;, whereupon Scooter gently persuades Miss Litella that she would be appearing on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, not &quot;The Muffin Show&quot;. After hearing this reassurance, she withdraws her objection, and meekly apologizes to Scooter by saying, &quot;Never mind.&quot;

The character also appeared in Radner&#x27;s 1979 one-woman off-Broadway show, &quot;Gilda Live&quot;, in which Litella took a job as a substitute teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, replacing a teacher who had been a victim of a stabbing by one of his students, which put him in the hospital. Miss Litella further cautioned her new students to be very careful where they put their toes, as the regular teacher&#x27;s &quot;stubbing&quot; was the third such &quot;stubbing&quot;, as Miss Litella put it, at the school that week alone; and that the &quot;stubbings&quot; must be pretty serious, in order to have put their teacher in hospital indefinitely. 

A similar character, Anthony Crispino (played by Bobby Moynihan), made his first appearance on a &quot;Weekend Update&quot; in Season 35, and became a recurring character.

<text>The Locked Room (original Swedish title: &quot;Det slutna rummet&quot;) is a mystery novel by Swedish writers Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, published in 1972. It is part of their detective series revolving around Martin Beck and his team.
&quot;The Locked Room&quot; has two plots running simultaneously. Larsson and Kollberg are extremely reluctantly part of a special task force that needs to solve a spree of bank robberies. Martin Beck is given a pity job after recovering from being shot at the conclusion of &quot;The Abominable Man&quot;; he needs to solve a classic situation of the genre: the locked room mystery.

The incompetence of the Swedish police force has spread to the point that all three detectives are severely hindered in their work. One criminal walks free for a heinous crime he did commit, then has to do hard time for a crime he did not.

== Plot summary==
The story begins with Beck recovered after his injury sustained at the end of the previous book and now returning to the National Police Bureau; he discovers that the police force still is amateurish and unprofessional for the most part, which he was accustomed to previously. Patrolmen have found a highly decomposed corpse (as it turns out later, a murdered man--found in a locked from inside apartment. An incompetent detective, Aldor Gustavsson, had the case shelved as suicide. No one was much disturbed by the fact that the weapon had not been found in the apartment.

The novel now has two storylines: the locked room investigation and the bank robbery specialists.

The latter take by accident the petty criminal Mauritzon, a mate of Malmström and Mohrén, and accuse him of a bank robbery in which a bank customer was shot. At the same time Martin Beck solves the locked room mystery- the gun was shot from outside by Maurtizon, when the window was open. The window had fallen so that the latch had closed by itself.

Since the evidence collected by Martin Beck is insufficient, Mauritzon is acquitted of murder; but for the bank robbery, of which he is innocent, but whose evidence he cannot refute, he is sentenced to manslaughter with lifetime imprisonment.

The bank robbers pursued by Attorney Olsson manage to fool the police (the robbery does not occur in Stockholm, but in Malmö instead).

During the investigation, Beck, in a depressive phase of his life, meets a woman named Rhea Nielsen and he finds new courage which in the following novels plays an important role.

== Characters ==
Beck meets Rhea Nielsen, and it is love at first sight, sort of, in slow motion. Contrary to his ex-wife, she is a no-nonsense left-wing type of person and his intellectual equal.

Criminal mastermind Werner Roos and bank robbers Malmström and Mohrén are introduced, as is their ineffectual but successful Nemesis, public prosecutor &#x27;Bulldozer&#x27; Olsson.

Police officer Kenneth Kvastmo is introduced to replace Kurt Kvant as Police officer Karl Kristianssons partner.

== Film adaptation ==
The book was adapted by Dutch filmmaker Jacob Bijl as &quot;De gesloten kamer&quot; in 1993. In this film, the action is set in Antwerp and Beck is played by famous Belgian actor Jan Decleir. Most of the other characters were renamed to match the new setting; for instance, the name of Beck&#x27;s colleague Kollberg was changed to Colbert.

<text>Duane Denison (born January 21, 1959) is an American guitarist best known for work with the punk rock band The Jesus Lizard. He is also a founding member of super-group Tomahawk.

==Biography==
Denison began his musical career by studying classical guitar at Eastern Michigan University. His work with classical guitar helped influence his unique sound, which helped earn him a spot on Spin Magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.&quot; &quot;Denison has played warped jazz-rock with Firewater, cool jazz with the Denison-Kimball Trio, experimental alt-metal with Tomahawk, rockabilly punk with Th’ Legendary Shack Shakers, and outlaw country with Hank Williams III. But the angular, metallic sheets of noise that Denison unleashed with the Jesus Lizard are what he’ll ultimately be remembered and revered for. Tightly controlled yet capable of ripping and tearing like a runaway chainsaw, Denison’s riffs influenced an entire generation of post-hardcore guitarists, including the burgeoning wave of noise-punkers like the Men and Roomrunner.” 

In 1999 Denison moved to Nashville after The Jesus Lizard broke up in order to play with Hank Williams III&#x27;s &quot;Damn Band&quot;. Soon after his move to Nashville, Denison began collaborating and exchanging demo tapes with Mike Patton, whom he met at a Mr. Bungle show in 1999. Denison started the demos on a 4 track tape machine and sent them to Patton who added vocals to the tapes and sent them back. After having a solid idea of what the songs should sound like they went into the studio and recorded what would become the first Tomahawk album which was released in 2001.

Denison and ex-Ministry bassist Paul Barker collaborated in 2007 to form a new band, U.S.S.A. U.S.S.A. released one album in that same year, titled &quot;The Spoils&quot;.

From late 2008 until 2012, he played guitar for Nashville-based Legendary Shack Shakers. Denison supplied the lead guitars on EmptyMansions snakes/vultures/sulfate released on April 2, 2013. 

== Influence ==
Duane Denison&#x27;s playing has influenced several notable guitarists, including Limp Bizkit&#x27;s Wes Borland, Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s Jim Adkins, and Every Time I Die&#x27;s Andy Williams.

<doc id="1097032" wikidata="Q374462" url="?curid=1097032" title="Ada Cambridge">
<text>Ada Cambridge (21 November 1844 – 19 July 1926), later known as Ada Cross, was an English-born Australian writer. She wrote more than 25 works of fiction, three volumes of poetry and two autobiographical works. Many of her novels were serialised in Australian newspapers but never published in book form. While she was known to friends and family by her married name, Ada Cross, her newspaper readers knew her as &quot;A.C.&quot; She later reverted to her maiden name, Ada Cambridge, and that is how she is known today.

==Life==
Ada was born at St Germans, Norfolk, the second child of Thomasine and Henry Cambridge, a gentleman farmer. She was educated by governesses, an experience she abhorred. She wrote in a book of reminiscences: &quot;I can truthfully affirm that I never learned anything which would now be considered worth learning until I had done with them all and started foraging for myself. I did have a few months of boarding-school at the end, and a very good school for its day it was, but it left no lasting impression on my mind.&quot; (&quot;The Retrospect&quot;, Chapter IV). It was an unmarried aunt who contributed most to her intellectual development.

On 25 April 1870, she married the Rev. George Frederick Cross and a few weeks later sailed for Australia. She arrived in Melbourne in August and was surprised to find it a well-established city. Her husband was sent to Wangaratta, then to Yackandandah (1872), Ballan (1874), Coleraine (1877), Bendigo (1884) and Beechworth (1885), where they remained until 1893. Her &quot;Thirty Years in Australia&quot; (1903) describes their experiences in these parishes. She experienced lost children to whooping cough and scarlet fever.

Cross at first was the typical hard-working wife of a country clergyman, taking part in all the activities of the parish and incidentally making her own children&#x27;s clothes. Her health, however, broke down, for a number of reasons, including a near-fatal miscarriage and a serious carriage accident, and her activities had to be reduced, but she continued to write.

In 1893, Cross and her husband moved to their last parish, Williamstown, near Melbourne, and remained there until 1909. Her husband went on the retired clergy list at the end of 1909 with permission to operate in the diocese until 1912. In 1913 they both returned to England, where they stayed until his death on 27 February 1917. Ada returned to Australia later that year. She died in Melbourne on 19 July 1926, and was buried at Brighton General Cemetery. She was survived by a daughter and a son, Dr K. Stuart Cross.

==Career==
While Cambridge began writing in the 1870s to make money to help support her children, her formal published career spans from 1865 with &quot;Hymns on the Litany&quot; and &quot;The Two Surplices&quot;, to 1922 with an article &quot;Nightfall&quot; in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. According to the scholar Patricia Barton, her early works &quot;contain the seeds of her lifelong insistence on and pursuit of physical, spiritual and moral integrity, as well as the interweaving of poetry and prose which was to typify her writing career.&quot; Nancy Cato writes that &quot;some of her ideas were considered daring and even a little improper for a clergyman&#x27;s wife. She touches on extramarital affairs and the physical bondage of wives.&quot;

In 1875, Cambridge&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Up the Murray&quot;, appeared in the &quot;Australasian&quot;, but was not published separately. It was not until 1890, with the publication of &quot;A Marked Man&quot;, that her fame as a writer was established. However, despite regular good reviews, there were many who discounted her because she did not write in the literary tradition of the time, one that was largely non-urban and masculine, that focused on survival against the harsh environment.

Cambridge was the first president of the Women Writers Club and an honorary life-member of the Lyceum Club of Melbourne. Her many friends in the literary world included Grace &quot;Jennings&quot; Carmichael, Rolf Boldrewood, Ethel Turner, and George Robertson.

==Legacy==
The Ada Cambridge Prizes were first awarded in 2005. There are now four such prizes: the Ada Cambridge Biographical Prose Prize, the Ada Cambridge Poetry Prize, the Young Adas Short Story Prize, and the Young Adas Graphic Short Story Prize. These all carry a cash component and winners are announced at the Williamstown Literary Festival each year.

Cambridge Street in the Canberra suburb of Cook is named after her.

<doc id="1097054" wikidata="Q6784331" url="?curid=1097054" title="Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group">
<text>Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group (MASSPIRG) is a non-profit organization that is one of the largest of the state PIRG organizations. It works on a variety of political activities, including textbook trading on college campuses. They also provide internships and work study jobs for students on Massachusetts college campuses. Along with the Massachusetts Service Alliance, MASSPIRG helped to create Massachusetts Community Water Watch, an organization that works specifically on environmental politics. Student funding of MASSPIRG has been criticized at several schools where students wish to see MASSPIRG funding cut, citing that the mandatory fees do not effectively contribute directly to any cause on campus, and are a complication to students forced to pay &quot;already tedious&quot; tuition fees.

==History==
The Public Interest Research Groups emerged at the behest of Ralph Nader who, during a college speaking tour, called on students to form political groups.

==Criticism and rebuttal==
The book &quot;Activism, Inc: How the Outsourcing of Grassroots Campaigns Is Strangling Progressive Politics in America&quot; by Columbia University sociologist Dana Fisher, is based on an ethnographic study she did in a stratified random sample of fund canvass offices during the summer of 2003. Fisher charges the corporatized fundraising model (of which the Fund is an example) with mistreating idealistic young people by using them as interchangeable parts and providing them with insufficient training. Fisher also states that the outsourcing of grassroots organizing by groups like the Sierra Club and Greenpeace to organizations like the Fund has led to the decay of grassroots infrastructure and opportunities for involvement on the left. The Fund has created a website, canvassingworks.org, to respond to a few of the criticisms raised by the book. The site includes testimony by former Fund staff who have moved into leading roles in other progressive organizations and other progressive leaders, including U.S. Representative Jan Schakowsky (IL), Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope, Dr. Woody Holton (Associate Professor of American history at the University of Richmond), and Randy Hayes of the Rainforest Action Network.

<doc id="1097055" wikidata="Q1140646" url="?curid=1097055" title="Battle of Formigny">
<text>The Battle of Formigny, fought on 15 April 1450, took place towards the end of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France. It was a decisive French victory that destroyed the last significant English field army in Normandy, and paved the way for the recapture of their remaining strongholds.

Although cannon had been employed in siege warfare since the early 14th century, Formigny is notable as one of the first recorded uses of field artillery on a European battlefield.

==Background==
Charles VII of France used the time afforded by the 1444 Treaty of Tours to reorganise and reinvigorate his armies. In contrast, the English were divided by the internal struggle for power that would lead to the Wars of the Roses in 1455. Inability to agree a coherent strategy left their forces in Normandy scattered and dangerously weak.

As a result, the French were in a much stronger position when they broke the truce in June 1449. By August, they had taken Pont-Audemer, Pont-L&#x27;Evêque and Lisieux, and by October had occupied much of Normandy. Cutting north and east, the Bureau brothers captured Rouen in October, Harfleur in December, then Honfleur and Fresnoy in January 1450, before investing Caen.

During the winter of 1449, the English assembled an expeditionary force in Portsmouth to relieve Caen. It was led by Sir Thomas Kyriell, a relatively unknown commander who would be comprehensively out manoeuvred by his French opponents. Lack of money and supplies hampered recruiting and lowered morale; in January 1450 the troops lynched an official sent to negotiate with them over pay.

On 15 March 1450, Kyriell and some 2,500 men landed in Cherbourg, where they were reinforced by another 1,800 collected by Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, English commander in Normandy. He did so by taking them from English garrisons in Bayeux, Caen, and Vire, under Sir Matthew Gough, Sir Robert Vere and Sir Henry Norbury respectively.

==Battle==
Rather than immediately relieving Caen as originally planned, Kyriell attacked Valognes, whose possession allowed the French to isolate Cherbourg from the rest of the Cotentin peninsula. It fell on 27 March after a short siege, and Kyriell continued onto French-held Carentan, which he reached on 12 April. Despite a number of small skirmishes, Clermont, the local French commander, refused to give battle, so Kyriell instead marched for Bayeux. He stopped near Formigny on 14 April, closely followed by 3,000 men from Carentan under Clermont. On the same day, the Constable of France, Arthur de Richemont, arrived in Saint-Lô with a Breton force of 2,000, split between 1,200 cavalry and 800 infantry. Having made contact, Clermont urged him to move on Formigny as soon as possible.

On 15 April, the English sighted Clermont, and the armies took up positions facing each other on the Carentan-Bayeux road, near a small tributary of the Aure. Now totalling somewhat less than 4,000 men, of whom 2,900 were archers, the English assembled in two main &quot;battles&quot; across the road to Carentan, with their backs to the stream. Although they did not have time to construct the usual defence works of sharpened stakes, Kyriell was confident since he outnumbered Clermont, and was unaware of Richemont&#x27;s proximity.

Pausing to assess the situation, in the early afternoon Clermont ordered his dismounted men at arms to attack the English position. These assaults were repulsed, as were two French cavalry probes of their flanks, and Clermont then instructed his two culverins to open fire. Since the guns were out of bowshot range, the English archers were unable to respond, and left their positions in an attempt to capture them. Around 7:00 pm, Richemont and his 1,200 cavalry arrived from the south, crossing the Aure and threatening the English flank. Encouraged by the presence of the French king&#x27;s most influential advisor, Pierre de Brézé, Clermont&#x27;s forces stood their ground.

With many of his men busy dragging the captured guns back to their lines, Kyriell shifted forces to the left to face the new threat, while Clermont responded by renewing his attack. The English were caught in the open by the Breton cavalry, then enveloped by French troops under Clermont and Brézé. Attacked from both sides, they were split into small groups and suffered heavy casualties. The vast majority were either killed or captured, including Kyriell, although Sir Matthew Gough and a small party escaped to Bayeux.

Contemporary chronicles suggest that despite protestations from their commanders, after the battle French infantrymen massacred about 500 captured English archers. Their corpses were reportedly buried in a nearby field, later dubbed &quot;The English Tomb&quot;.

==Aftermath==
Kyriell&#x27;s army was effectively destroyed, the vast majority either killed or taken prisoner. Contemporary French records claim 3,744 bodies were buried, although this seems to have included casualties from both sides. The same sources suggest another 1,200 to 1,400 were taken prisoner, while other historians suggest 2,500 killed and 900 captured. Estimates of French and Breton losses vary from &quot;less than a thousand&quot;, to &quot;about 500&quot;, or &quot;a handful&quot;. The victors quickly recaptured the whole of Normandy, Caen falling on 12 June, and Cherbourg on 12 August.

Prior to 1450, artillery had largely been employed in siege warfare, with Formigny perhaps the first engagement when cannon are recorded as being used on the battlefield. Unlike the better known Battle of Castillon, contemporary accounts are unclear on how effective they were. The arrival of the Breton cavalry was arguably more decisive in forcing the English to leave their prepared defensive positions, although the French guns also played a role.

Most significantly, the noise of their firing alerted Richemont to the fact that a battle was taking place and its rough location, so causing his appearance on the field. One of Clermont&#x27;s captains claimed that if Richemont had not arrived when he did, their army would have suffered &quot;irreparable damage&quot;.

<text>Xaverian College is a Roman Catholic college located in Rusholme, Manchester, approximately two miles south of the city centre. Established in 1862, it is recognised as being one of the most oversubscribed sixth form colleges in Greater Manchester, along with Ashton Sixth Form College and Loreto College. As a member of the Association of Colleges, the college has an offer rate of 30% (2019).

The college is near the University of Manchester and the Royal Northern College of Music. Through its partnership with the University of Manchester, Xaverian College hosts foundational science courses on behalf of the university. Additionally, Xaverian College students benefit from access to the resources available at the University of Manchester Library.

==History==

===1862-1976===

The Xaverian Brothers, or Congregation of St Francis Xavier (CFX), are a Roman Catholic religious order founded by Theodore James Ryken in Bruges, Belgium, in 1839 and named after St. Francis Xavier. The order is dedicated to Roman Catholic education in the United Kingdom, the United States and many other countries.

 The college was founded by the Xaverian Brothers in 1862 and until 1903 was housed in a four-storey building on Oxford Road, Manchester. On the move to the then gated Victoria Park, it was originally housed in a building known as Firwood, but over time, through new building projects and acquisition, the campus grew.

Firwood was home to the Brothers until 1993 when the last of them left. Another former house which has now become part of the college, Ward Hall, was used as a camp for American servicemen in the Second World War.

Mancunian Films, a motion picture production company, used the exterior of the college in several of their films, including &quot;It&#x27;s A Grand Life&quot;, starring Frank Randle and Diana Dors. The film company sold their Dickenson Road Studios to the BBC in 1954, making Dickenson Road Studios the first regional BBC TV studio. When the BBC left in 1974 to move to Oxford Road, Xaverian inherited their lighting rigs, now used in the drama studio. From 1946 to 1977, the school was a direct grant grammar school.

===1977 to present===
The college was a Roman Catholic grammar school for boys until 1977, when it became a mixed sixth-form college. Direct Grant Grammar School status ended and Xaverian became a Sixth Form College for young men and women aged sixteen to nineteen within the Manchester Local Education Authority. In 1993, the College Principal Mrs Quinn led an expansion in student numbers, refurbished and modernised many of the buildings and updated the curriculum with vocationally based courses and the introduction of information technology across many subjects. Her greatest success, however, was to maintain the distinctive Xaverian mission and ethos in a period of much change and uncertainty.

Capital from the Xaverian Brothers and grants from the FEFC allowed a new multi-resource building, The Ryken, to be constructed in 2002. By 2005, the FEFC had become the Learning and Skills Council and recognised the college&#x27;s progress by part funding a state-of-the-art new building, which was named Mayfield. 

In 2007, Mrs Mary Hunter was made Principal. Her appointment can be seen as another watershed in the life of Xaverian. Hunter, whose previous experience was in the general FE sector, brought both an objective eye and a heart-felt empathy to a college truly committed to a special Mission. This was recognised in the latest Ofsted Inspection when the college was graded outstanding in all areas of the report. The college was subsequently awarded Beacon status.

==Campus==

The college consists of nine buildings on two sides of Lower Park Road: Ward Hall, Birtles, Marylands, Firwood, Xavier, Sunbury, Ryken, Mayfield, and Teresa Quinn built from 1840 onwards. Additions and renovations have been an ongoing feature of the campus&#x27;s development, with Birtles a key example of this process. The Ryken and Mayfield buildings, added at the start of the 21st century, along with Teresa Quinn, opened in 2020, house information technology equipment. The Ryken building was named after one of the founders of the Xaverian order, Theodore James Ryken. The college buildings are around the perimeter of a central grassed area where sporting and social activities take place.

<text>The Nashua River, long, is a tributary of the Merrimack River in Massachusetts and New Hampshire in the United States. It is formed in eastern Worcester County, Massachusetts, at the confluence of the North Nashua River and South Nashua River, and flows generally north-northeast past Groton to join the Merrimack at Nashua, New Hampshire. The Nashua River watershed occupies a major portion of north-central Massachusetts and a much smaller portion of southern New Hampshire.

The North Nashua River rises west of Fitchburg and Westminster. It flows about generally southeast past Fitchburg, and joins the South Nashua River, shown on USGS topographic maps as the main stem of the Nashua River, about below its issuance from the Wachusett Reservoir.

==History==
The river&#x27;s name derives from an Algonkian word meaning &quot;beautiful river with a pebbly bottom.&quot;

The Nashua River was heavily used for industry during the colonial period and the early years of the United States. During the late 18th century and early 19th century, the heavy concentration of paper mills and the use of dyes near Fitchburg resulted in pollution that notoriously turned the river various colors downstream from the factories.

In the mid-1960s, Marion Stoddart started a campaign to restore the Nashua River and its tributaries. She built coalitions with labor leaders and business leaders, in particular the paper companies who were the worst polluters of the river. With federal help, eight treatment plants were built or upgraded along the river. A broad conservation buffer was created along about half the river and its two main tributaries. By the early-1990s, most of the industry was still located along the river, but many parts of the river were once again safe for swimming. Her work is the subject of a 30-minute documentary movie titled &quot;Marion Stoddart: Work of 1000&quot;.

Recovery has sparked recreational use of the river at places like Mine Falls Park in Nashua.

The largely volunteer Nashua River Watershed Association, based in Groton, Massachusetts, oversees the condition of the river.

In 2013, Public Law 116–9 designated of the Nashua River as a National Wild and Scenic River. The legislation was sponsored by Rep. Niki Tsongas (D, MA-3), supported by the Nashua River Watershed Association and The Wilderness Society.

==Watershed==
From its impoundment at the Wachusett Reservoir in Clinton, Massachusetts, the South Nashua River flows north and joins the North Nashua River in Lancaster. The North Nashua River flows southeast from Fitchburg and Leominster to Lancaster. The Nashua River flows northward from Lancaster, meandering its way through the north-central Massachusetts towns of Harvard, Groton, Dunstable, and Pepperell, before eventually emptying into the Merrimack River at Nashua, New Hampshire. The Nashua River watershed has a total drainage area of approximately , with of the watershed occurring in Massachusetts and in New Hampshire. The Nashua River flows for approximately , with approximately 46 of those miles (74 km) flowing through Massachusetts. The Squannacook, Nissitissit, Stillwater, Quinapoxet, North Nashua, and South Nashua rivers feed it. The watershed encompasses all or part of 31 communities, 7 in southern New Hampshire and 24 in central Massachusetts. The watershed&#x27;s largest water body is the Wachusett Reservoir, which provides drinking water to two-thirds of the Commonwealth&#x27;s population.

===Major watershed components===
*Wachusett Reservoir is the largest water body.
**The Stillwater River feeds Wachusett Reservoir from the northwest.
**The Quinapoxet River feeds Wachusett Reservoir from the west.
*Wachusett Reservoir Dam impounds the South Nashua River.
* The North Nashua River joins the South Nashua River at Lancaster from the northwest.
* The Squannacook River joins the Nashua River from the northwest at the junction of the town boundaries of Shirley, Groton, and Ayer.

<text>Francis Preston Blair Lee III (May 19, 1916 – October 25, 1985) was an American politician who served as the second lieutenant governor of Maryland from 1971 to 1979 and served as acting governor of Maryland from 1977 to 1979, during Marvin Mandel&#x27;s self-imposed suspension of gubernatorial powers and duties. He served as secretary of State of Maryland from 1969 to 1971 and was a member of the Democratic Party.

==Early life, family and career==
Lee was born in Silver Spring, Maryland, the son of Elizabeth S. (Wilson) and Colonel Edward Brooke Lee, the former Comptroller of the state of Maryland (chief financial officer). He was a member of the Lee family, a major historical political family in American history. He was grandson of the first popularly elected Maryland U.S. Senator, Blair Lee I; direct descendant of signer of the Declaration of Independence, Richard Henry Lee and also Francis Preston Blair, an adviser and friend of Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, and Abraham Lincoln.

Lee majored in American history at Princeton University, where he graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1938. His thesis, &quot;The Free Soil Movement in the 1840s&quot;, was based on correspondences between his ancestors and Presidents, cabinet members, and others from his family&#x27;s private collection. After spending time studying law at The George Washington University, the entry of the United States into World War II in 1941 resulted in Lee joining the United States Navy Reserve. He spent the War working on supply ships in the Atlantic Ocean. It was also during the War, on July 6, 1944, that he married Mathilde Boal with whom he would have eight children. After four years of service, Lee was discharged with the rank of lieutenant commander in 1945.

After the War, Lee began work as a newspaper journalist. He worked as an editor for his father&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Maryland News&quot;, and also served as President of the Maryland Press Association and Silver Spring Board of Trade in 1949. Lee also pursued environmental interests in government, serving as Vice Chairman and Park Commissioner of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (MNCPPC) until 1951, and Executive Officer of the National Capital Planning Commission from 1951 to 1954.

==Maryland political career==
Lee entered politics shortly after the end of the Second World War, serving as delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1948, and later in 1960 and 1964. He was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1954, and served until 1962, when he made an unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate. In the House, Lee served as chairman of the Montgomery County delegation, and was chosen in 1958 by the Maryland Legislative Correspondents Association as &quot;Legislator of the Year&quot; for his efforts in resolving a crisis that emerged between the Maryland General Assembly and the Maryland State Teacher&#x27;s Association.

In presidential politics, Lee served as campaign manager for John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1960 presidential bid in Montgomery County, and in 1964 as regional coordinator for the Lyndon B. Johnson campaign.

In 1966, Lee entered the Maryland State Senate, where he served on the Finance Committee as vice chairman and in the Legislative Council. He was chosen Secretary of State of Maryland by Governor Marvin Mandel in 1969.

==Lieutenant Governor and Acting Governor==
Following the amendment of the Constitution of Maryland in 1970, the office of Lieutenant Governor of Maryland was created, and voters chose Lee to serve in that position. During his tenure as Lt. Governor, Lee served on various committees and commissions established by the Governor. Also as Lt. Governor, Lee helped prepare the budget, determine policy actions, and served as chairman of the Governor&#x27;s Cabinet, as well as Governor&#x27;s Chief of Staff.

The most notable moment of Lee&#x27;s career occurred when Governor Mandel designated Lee as Acting Governor of Maryland, effective with a letter dated June 4, 1977, per Article 2, Section 6b, of the Maryland Constitution of 1867. Mandel&#x27;s decision was the result of a stroke, as well as federal political corruption charges that were linked to some $200,000 in gifts received. Lee continued to serve as Acting Governor until Mandel rescinded his letter on January 15, 1979, though Mandel briefly reinstated Lee as acting governor the next day so he would be able to preside over the appointment of a judge to the Maryland Court of Appeals.

Even with the added boost of serving as acting governor, Lee was not able to overcome the severe damage the Mandel Administration had taken as a result of the corruption trial. He unexpectedly lost his attempt for election in the Democratic primary to Harry R. Hughes, who would later win the general election and succeed Mandel as governor in 1979. Lee stated a few days after the loss that he was relieved of a burden, and that it was a &quot;luxurious feeling&quot; coming upon problems that he would not have to worry about. However, acquaintances and staff members commented that he seemed melancholic and deflated. Many of his staff shared the same feelings, since the loss was unexpected and most did not have any contingency plans.

==Later years and legacy==

In 1980, Lee was appointed to the University of Maryland, College Park Board of Regents, where he served until his death from cancer at his home in Silver Spring on October 25, 1985. After his death, commentators remarked that Lee was an able governor, but a modest politician who was not comfortable working in crowds and did not adequately distance himself from the corruption of Mandel and Mandel&#x27;s predecessor, Spiro Agnew. Lee was also damaged by family troubles, which included the suicide of one of his sons in 1973. Nevertheless, Lee was praised by the media for his eloquence, honesty, and capable administrative skills. He is buried in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="1097066" wikidata="Q3016710" url="?curid=1097066" title="Naval Air Facility Atsugi">
<text>is a joint Japan-US naval air base located in the cities of Yamato and Ayase in Kanagawa, Japan. It is the largest United States Navy (USN) air base in the Pacific Ocean, and once housed the squadrons of Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5), which deploys with the American aircraft carrier .

During 2017 and 2018 the fixed-wing aircraft of CVW-5 relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in western Japan.

CVW-5 shares the base with the Headquarters Fleet Air Force, and Fleet Air Wing 4 of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). NAF Atsugi is also home to Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 51 (HSM-51), which provides detachments of MH-60R helicopters to forward deployed U.S. Navy guided missile cruisers, guided missile destroyers, and frigates homeported at the nearby Yokosuka Naval Base. Service members stationed at Atsugi also work in conjunction with the former Kamiseya Naval Radio Receiving Facility.

Despite its name, the base is east northeast from the city of Atsugi, and is not adjacent to the city.

==History==
The Imperial Japanese Navy constructed the base in 1938 to house the 302nd Kokutai, one of the Navy&#x27;s most formidable fighter squadrons during World War II. Aircraft based at Atsugi shot down more than 300 American bombers during the firebombings of 1945. After Japan&#x27;s surrender, many of Atsugi&#x27;s pilots refused to follow Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s order to lay down their arms, and took to the skies to drop leaflets on Tokyo and Yokohama urging locals to resist the Americans. Eventually, these pilots gave up, and left Atsugi.

General Douglas MacArthur arrived at Atsugi on 30 August to accept Japan&#x27;s surrender. Shortly afterwards, elements of the USAAF 3d Bombardment Group moved in about 8 September, being replaced by the USAAF 49th Fighter Group on 15 September which handled the initial cleanup of the heavily damaged airfield along with the 1539th Army Air Forces Base Unit to provide station facilities. Minimal flight operations were restored by October which allowed the P-61 Black Widow-equipped 418th Night Fighter Squadron to operate from the airfield to provide air defense over the area, along with the P-38 Lightnings of the 49th FG. The 49th moved to Chitose Airfield on Hokkaido in mid February 1946, the 418th NFS to Okinawa in June, and on 31 December 1946 the 1539th AAFBU moved to Haneda Airfield.

During the occupation, the base housed the overflow from nearby Camp Zama; it was not refurbished to handle military air traffic until the Korean War. The Seabees (Navy construction battalions) came to the base in 1950 and prepared it for re-opening that December as Naval Air Station Atsugi.

NAF Atsugi was a major naval air base during both the Korean War and Vietnam War, serving fighters, bombers, and transport aircraft.

One of the aircraft based at Atsugi at least since 1957 was the U-2 spy plane. The plane made local Japanese headlines when it ran low on fuel and made an emergency landing at a glider-club landing strip. This same plane was piloted by Gary Powers, which provoked an international incident when it was downed over the Soviet Union.

Lee Harvey Oswald was based at Atsugi during his time in the United States Marines. He was a radar operator assigned to Marine Air Control Squadron 1. He was stationed there from September 1957 to November 1958.

In 1964 a United States Marine Corps F8U-2 Crusader based at the airfield crashed in nearby Machida, Tokyo. The pilot ejected, and was not seriously injured, but the crash killed four, and injured 32 people on the ground, and destroyed seven houses.

In 1969 an EC-121 aircraft of VQ-1 that took off from Atsugi on a reconnaissance mission near North Korea was shot down by a North Korean MiG-21. A series of options for response were presented to Nixon but ultimately no action was taken. The reconnaissance flights resumed a week later.

In 1972, the U.S. and Japanese governments agreed to share ownership of the base, after which the Japan Maritime Self Defence Force began operating from there.

In 1973 Yokosuka became the home port of the carrier . As a consequence CVW-5, the carrier&#x27;s air wing was based at Atsugi.

On 2 November 1976, a US Navy Grumman C-1 Trader, piloted by Lt. Laury K. Backman, suffered a mechanical failure of the aileron system while maneuvering to land on runway 01, and crashed short of the runway. All six aboard were killed.

In 1977, a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II based at the facility suffered a mechanical failure, and crashed into a residential neighborhood in nearby Yokohama. The crew ejected and survived, but two young boys, aged 1 and 3, were killed, and 7 others injured.

Elements of the Naval Security Group, and rotational squadrons of EP-3 Aries that are now stationed at Misawa Air Base were formerly stationed at Atsugi until the 1990s.

On 9 February 1999 a fire broke out at a terminal, no injuries were reported.

On 3 April 2003 a faction of the leftist group Kakurōkyō attacked the facility with improvised mortar fire. Around the same time the same group also attacked Yokota Air Base, and the National Defence Agency.

In 2004 a McDonnell Douglas MD 900 Explorer operated by Aero Asahi made a crash-landing at Naval Air Facility Atsugi. There were no fatalities.

On 14 November 2009 a fire in Hangar 183 at the base injured three Japanese employees of Obayashi Corporation. The fire was reported at 11:55 a.m., and was extinguished by 12:45 p.m. The hangar was moderately damaged.

In December 2009, Atsugi was again attacked, this time by Kakurōkyō members via improvised mortar barrages.

Personnel and aircraft from the base assisted with Operation Tomodachi following and during the March 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima I nuclear accidents. During the crisis, around 2,000 American family members voluntarily departed the base for locations outside Japan.

On 16 December 2013 a MH-60S Knighthawk of CVW-5 crashed in Miura city due to a tail jam. The aircraft was written off, and two of the four occupants were injured.

On 15 February 2014 three US Navy P-3 Orions were crushed &quot;beyond repair&quot; when their hangar was destroyed due to a massive snow storm.

In December 2016 police arrested a Kawasaki man for pointing a laser pointer at JMSDF aircraft in July of the same year. It was reported that in 2016 there had been about 30 reports of laser pointers being directed at Japanese, and US aircraft.

A Grumman C-2A Greyhound assigned to VRC-30 aboard the USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot; was lost in an accident at sea on 22 November 2017. Three of the personnel on board were lost. After this a detachment of 4-6 US Marine Corps Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft were deployed to Atsugi for a week to fly supplies to the .

==Base name==
Atsugi is named after the nearby city of Atsugi despite not actually being in Atsugi (it is separated from Atsugi by two other cities).

The name was chosen because Atsugi was the only large town in the area as of 1950, and the three farming villages surrounding the base at that time—Yamato Village, Ayase Village, and Shibuya Village—shared names with better-known areas elsewhere in Japan. Yamato is an alternative name for the Nara region, Ayase is generally associated with the area around Ayase Station in northeast Tokyo, and Shibuya is generally associated with the ward of Shibuya in central Tokyo.

==Base issues==
===The Jinkanpo Incinerator===
NAF Atsugi and the people stationed there gained notoriety in the 1990s (stemming from near-daily reports in the &quot;Pacific Stars and Stripes&quot; newspaper) due to their proximity to the Jinkanpo Atsugi Incinerator, which blew toxic, and cancerous emissions over the high-rise buildings in its immediate vicinity. The incinerator&#x27;s owners, arrested and jailed for charges of tax evasion, neglected the maintenance of the facility. The pollution had become so much of a health problem for residents that if they showed signs of adverse health effects, the base allowed them to leave early (usually servicemembers are stationed at the base for a tour of three years). Many servicemembers reported sickness, and a few died from cancer shortly after moving back to the United States. For a time, the base required servicemembers to undergo medical screenings before being stationed at the base in order to ensure that their bodies could handle the poor air quality. In spite of this, servicemembers still developed health problems, such as acute cases of asthma.

The US government&#x27;s Department of Justice sued the incinerator operators. In May 2001, just before the court was to hand down its decision, the Japanese government purchased the plant for nearly 40 million dollars and shut it down. Dismantling was completed by the end of that year.

===Noise lawsuits===
Since 1976 there have been a number of lawsuits with local residents sued the Japanese government over noise from the base, and in October 2002 the Yokohama district court ruled that the government should pay 2.75 billion yen in compensation. Both the plaintiffs, and the government appealed the case and in July 2006 the Tokyo High Court ordered the government to pay 4.04 billion yen to 4,865 people living near the base.

The fourth lawsuit over noise was filed in 2007 in the Yokohama District Court. In May 2014 the court ruled that the SDF should not operate its aircraft between 10pm to 6am and that the government should pay ¥7 billion yen in damages. It was the first lawsuit to request the grounding of US military aircraft. This request was rejected by the court.

The ruling was appealed, and in its July 2015 ruling the Tokyo High Court gave ¥9.4 billion to around 6,900 residents from eight cities, increasing the payout from the ¥7 billion yen ordered by the Yokohama district court. The Tokyo court also rejected calls to forbid night flights by US aircraft, arguing that the Japan-US security treaty is beyond the government&#x27;s jurisdiction. In this it was following a Supreme Court ruling on the 1976 case, where the court ruled that the Japanese government has no power to regulate the activities of US forces in the country.

The case was appealed to the Supreme Court and in December 2016 Japan&#x27;s Supreme Court overturned the ban on SDF night flights. It upheld the damages awarded by the Tokyo High Court. The plaintiffs planned to file a fifth lawsuit as soon as February 2017.

Organizing by residents continued and in July 2017 it was reported that there were plans for around 6,000 local people to launch the fifth lawsuit against the government regarding noise from the base. Shuji Onami, leader of the plaintiffs, stated &quot;Our lives are disrupted and are even put at risk whenever we are hit with booming noise (from aircraft) overhead. We will never accept the reality of the Atsugi base-related flights.&quot; It was also reported that 2,000 to 3,000 additional residents may also join the action at a later time.

As of August 2017 6,063 nearby residents had joined the lawsuit.
==Protests and complaints==
In addition to the lawsuits over noise there have been a number of protests regarding the base. In July 1988 20,000 people made a human chain around the base to protest about noisy night landings at the base.

In 2005 Yamato city officials protested over noisy night landings from F/A-18 Hornet training.

In 2007 the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) protested about F-16 and F/A-18 exercises at the base, and asked that they be stopped.

In 2013 the JCP also protested after a USN MH-60S Seahawk helicopter from Atsugi crashed in Miura city, and asked that Bell Boeing V-22 Ospreys not be deployed to Atsugi. When Ospreys were sent to the base for training this also caused local protests.

There were complaints in 2017 after children were allowed to touch machine guns on US helicopters during the May 2017 open day at Atsugi. City authorities from Ayase and Yamato cities complained, after which the machine guns were quickly removed.

==Friendship festival==
During Spring Atsugi holds an open day. Non-Japanese visitors may be turned away from the gates for security reasons. Prospective attendees who are neither Japanese or American should bring identification and also consult the Third Country National list to see if they require special approval to enter the base.

There was an &quot;Atsugi WINGS&quot; air show held until the year 2000, featuring the &quot;diamond of diamonds&quot; display by formations of US Navy aircraft. This was last held in the year 2000. There were many complaints about aircraft noise and low-flying planes, and from 2001 onwards full-fledged flying displays were not held during the open day. Currently there is a ground display of US Navy and JMSDF aircraft, as well as take-offs and landings by various aircraft, including touch-and-go landing practice.

==Carrier Air Wing Five==

Atsugi hosts part of Carrier Air Wing Five, part of aircraft carrier USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&#x27;s&quot; air component. The wing includes about 70 aircraft and 2,000 military personnel who are stationed at Atsugi when the carrier is in port at Yokosuka. On 9 May 2008 the wing commander, Captain Michael P. McNellis, was relieved of command by Rear Admiral Richard B. Wren, commander of Commander Task Force 70, after the admiral said he lost confidence in McNellis&#x27; ability to command. McNellis was replaced by Captain Michael S. White. In 2012 the squadrons of CVW 5 completed their transition to variants of the Super Hornet/Growler, making it the first air wing without legacy Hornets.

===Relocation to Iwakuni===
Since at least 2005 there have been plans to relocate Carrier Air Wing Five&#x27;s approximately 60 fixed wing aircraft from Atsugi to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni in Yamaguchi prefecture. Yamaguchi governor Sekinari Nii said there was &quot;no way&quot; Yamaguchi prefecture would accept this. In 2006 Iwakuni voters rejected the plan in a plebiscite and Iwakuni mayor Katsusuke Ihara urged Tokyo to drop the plan. In 2007 the Japanese government passed legislation to prepare for the relocation of US Forces in Japan including subsidies for local affected areas.

The move was planned to have been done in 2014, but after construction delays the move was delayed by three years, to 2017.

The plan was for the move to take place in stages and be completed in May 2018. The move did not include the wing&#x27;s approximately 20 helicopters.

The move began in August 2017 with the five E-2D Hawkeye aircraft of VAW-125 relocating to Iwakuni after the USS &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s summer 2017 patrol. Around 3800 personnel were expected to move to Iwakuni.

By 28 November three more squadrons relocated after the &quot;Ronald Reagan&quot;″s second patrol of 2017. The new squadrons were the F/A-18E Super Hornet-equipped VFA-115 and VFA-195 and the EA-18G Growler-equipped VAQ-141. Fleet Logistics Support Squadron VRC-30 also relocated to MCASI by December 2017.

In March 2018 strike fighter squadrons VFA-27 with the F/A-18E Super Hornet and VFA-102 with the F/A-18F Super Hornet arrived at MCAS Iwakuni, completing the move of CVW-5&#x27;s fixed-wing aircraft squadrons.

<text>The Ruts (later known as Ruts DC) are an English reggae-influenced punk rock band, notable for the 1979 UK top 10 hit single &quot;Babylon&#x27;s Burning&quot;, and an earlier single &quot;In a Rut&quot;, which was not a hit but was highly regarded and regularly played by BBC Radio 1 disc jockey John Peel. The band&#x27;s newfound success was cut short by the death of lead singer Malcolm Owen from a heroin overdose in 1980. Despite this the band continued under a different musical style as Ruts D.C. until 1983 when they disbanded. The band reformed in 2007.

==Career==

===Formation and early days===
The Ruts were formed on 18 August 1977. The band consisted of singer Malcolm Owen (vocals), Paul Fox (guitar), John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings (bass) and Dave Ruffy (drums). On 16 September 1977, the band made their live debut, playing three songs during a break in a set by Mr Softy (another Fox band) at The Target, a pub in Northolt, Middlesex. Ruffy moved from bass to drums after original drummer Paul Mattocks left, and the band was active in anti-racist causes as part of the Misty in Roots People Unite collective based in Southall, West London, playing several benefits for Rock Against Racism. Although the band were often described as coming from Southall, Owen was from Hayes, Fox moved from Kilburn to Hayes in the 1960s, whilst Ruffy and Segs were based in South London. Ruffy had been born in York, but spent his formative years in the East End of London, whilst Segs grew up in Southend-on-Sea, having been born in the East End.

Schoolboy friends Fox and Owen shared a mutual interest in music, having met at Hayes Manor School. In the early 1970s they lived together in a commune on the Isle of Anglesey off the coast of North Wales, where they formed a rock band called Aslan with Paul Mattock, who played flute, guitar and keyboards and later became the Ruts&#x27; first drummer.

Post Office telephone engineer Jennings met record shop manager Ruffy in 1976 and became interested in punk after discussing the latter&#x27;s Ramones&#x27; T-shirt. Meanwhile, Owen&#x27;s interest in punk was piqued when he saw the Sex Pistols playing live. At the time, Fox was playing with Ruffy in a funk band, Hit and Run, which included J. D. Nicholas (who went on to join the Commodores in the U.S.) and sixteen-year-old saxophone player Gary Barnacle, who later played on several Ruts songs. Hit and Run were a covers band who released one single, a version of Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs&#x27; 1965 hit &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;. The Ruts&#x27; initial history is described in an audio interview with Jennings, conducted by Alan Parker, which appears on the album &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot;.

===1970s===
Early Ruts songs recorded at The Former Orange studios in London&#x27;s Covent Garden on 1 October 1977 were &quot;Stepping Bondage&quot;, &quot;Rich Bitch&quot;, &quot;Out of Order&quot;, &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Sofisticated&quot; and &quot;Lobotomy&quot;. The group began to evolve and become more musically adventurous, incorporating reggae and dub elements into their repertoire. Dave Ruffy returned to the drums and a new bassist, &#x27;Segs&#x27; Jennings, was recruited. The new Ruts line-up debuted supporting Wayne County and the Electric Chairs at High Wycombe town hall on 25 January 1978.

The Ruts&#x27; first single, &quot;In a Rut&quot; was finally released on People Unite in January 1979, having been recorded back on 24 April 1978 at the Free Range 8-track studios. It was backed up with anti-heroin tirade &quot;H-Eyes&quot; on the B-side (&quot;You&#x27;re so young, you take smack for fun/It&#x27;s gonna screw your head, you&#x27;re gonna wind up dead&quot;). DJ John Peel expressed his admiration for the group on air (as can be heard on a retrospective 1978 radio show clip on the &quot;In a Can&quot; album) and a session for the BBC swiftly followed the same month. DJ David Jensen also showcased the band in a further session recorded for the BBC in February 1979. A second Peel session was in May 1979.

In 1979, after a chance meeting with the Damned drummer Rat Scabies, the band toured the UK as the Damned&#x27;s support act. A bootleg of their 3 November slot at Strathclyde University includes a rendition of the Damned&#x27;s &quot;Love Song&quot; as well as a cover version of the rock and roll standard &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;. The Damned also played live covers of &quot;In a Rut&quot; during this period as evidenced on the &quot;Noise: The Best of the Damned Live&quot; album.
In June their debut single for Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Records, &quot;Babylon&#x27;s Burning&quot; reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart, prompting an appearance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. The second Virgin single, &quot;Something That I Said&quot;, followed in August 1979 and garnered a second &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; spot. The B-side was a reggae track &quot;Give Youth a Chance&quot; (also known as &quot;Blackman&#x27;s Pinch&quot;) originally recorded for the band&#x27;s John Peel session in May.

Their debut album, &quot;The Crack&quot;, was produced by Mick Glossop and released in September 1979, reaching number 16 in the UK Albums Chart. The two singles, &quot;Babylon&#x27;s Burning&quot; and &quot;Something That I Said&quot;, were re-recorded for the album. Edited from the album, the band&#x27;s third single for Virgin at the end of October 1979 was the roots reggae track &quot;Jah War&quot;, about the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s Special Patrol Group&#x27;s violence in Southall disturbances in April 1979. However, the BBC refused to play it, labelling the song as &quot;too political&quot;.

===1980s===
On 11 February 1980, the band returned to a BBC studio for their third Peel session, two tracks of which – &quot;Demolition Dancing&quot; and &quot;Secret Soldiers&quot; – later appeared on Virgin&#x27;s posthumous &quot;Grin &amp; Bear It&quot; album.

By this time, singer Malcolm Owen was suffering with health problems; a combination of sore throats and a heroin addiction. Contrary to some later reports, which suggested he had started taking heroin when his wife, Roxana had left him, Owen had been dabbling with heroin since the time he and Fox spent in Wales. A UK tour was arranged, the &#x27;Back to Blighty&#x27; tour, but a number of dates had to be cancelled due to Owen&#x27;s condition. What turned out to be the last Ruts gig with Owen took place at Plymouth Polytechnic on 26 February 1980.

On 27 March 1980, the Ruts released their fifth single, &quot;Staring at the Rude Boys&quot;, a comment on the rapidly rising Two Tone scene. It was backed by another reggae song &quot;Love in Vain&quot;. The single reached the No. 22 spot on the UK Singles Chart.

The Ruts backed Laurel Aitken who was then signed to Secret Affair&#x27;s record label, I-Spy Records, on a Peel session for BBC Radio 1, in April 1980, and also backed Aitken on his support tour to Secret Affair. The line-up was Aitken, Fox, Jennings, Ruffy, Owen and Barnacle. The band also played for Aitken on his single, &quot;Rudi Got Married&quot;.

With their latest UK tour sold out in advance and a US tour lined up, the band began work on their second album in early 1980. Having been forced to cancel a number of UK tour dates, the other three band members fired their frontman over his drug addiction, shortly after completing work on their next single, &quot;West One (Shine on Me)&quot;. After negotiations, Owen briefly rejoined the band.

Despite having spent time living at his parents’ house, free from heroin, Malcolm Owen was found dead in the bathroom of his parents&#x27; house in Hayes, from a heroin overdose on 14 July 1980 at the age of 26. Prophetically, the track &quot;H-eyes&quot;, which was the B-side of their first single &quot;In a Rut&quot;, was a song against heroin use, and two other songs, &quot;Dope for Guns&quot; from the album &quot;The Crack&quot;, plus reggae lament &quot;Love in Vein&quot; (&quot;don&#x27;t want you in my arms no more&quot;) were also anti-drug songs. A year later, the Damned wrote a song, &quot;The Limit Club&quot;, about their deceased friend which mentions the &quot;velvet claws&quot; that Fox talked about with reference to Owen&#x27;s heroin addiction.

On 22 August 1980, the band&#x27;s sixth and final single was released, &quot;West One (Shine on Me)&quot;. Co-produced by the band themselves as they were &quot;starting to get pissed off with the music business&quot; (according to Jennings in an audio interview on &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot;), the song featured brass and segued into a dub remix. The B-side was &quot;The Crack&quot;, a lighthearted mini-pastiche of their debut album, recorded in a number of musical styles. It peaked at No. 43 in the UK Singles Chart. The band refused an invitation to perform on ‘Top of the Pops’, as the BBC had insisted that Jennings or Fox mime Owen&#x27;s vocal part, which the band found distasteful.

Virgin issued a second album later in 1980, a compilation of singles, demos and live tracks entitled &quot;Grin &amp; Bear It&quot;. The three live tracks – &quot;S.U.S.&quot;, &quot;Babylon&#x27;s Burning&quot; and &quot;Society&quot; had been recorded for &quot;Chorus&quot;, a French TV show, in January of that year. When this was later reissued on CD, early tracks &quot;Stepping Bondage&quot;, &quot;Lobotomy&quot; and &quot;Rich Bitch&quot; were added. 1980 also saw the collaboration of the remaining band members with Kevin Coyne on one half of his double album, &quot;Sanity Stomp&quot;. In 1981 they performed as the backing band of French singer Valérie Lagrange on her album &quot;Chez Moi&quot;.

The band continued as Ruts D.C. (D.C. standing for the Italian term &quot;da capo&quot;, meaning &quot;back to the beginning&quot;) in a different musical vein. They released two albums, &quot;Animal Now&quot; (May 1981 on Virgin) and &quot;Rhythm Collision&quot; (July 1982 on Bohemian Records), the latter in collaboration with Mad Professor, a renowned dub producer. Ruts D.C. split in 1983.

In 1987 Dojo Records and Castle Communications released RUTS LIVE, an eleven-track album licensed from Link Communications (DOJO LP52).

In 1987, BBC label Strange Fruit collected together the group&#x27;s three Radio One sessions for &quot;The Peel Session Album: The Ruts&quot;. Live albums soon followed, including &quot;BBC Radio One in Concert&quot; (Windsong) recorded at London&#x27;s Paris Theatre on 7 July 1979, &quot;The Ruts Live&quot; (Dojo) and &quot;Live and Loud!&quot; (Link).

===1990s and later===
Virgin released &quot;The Ruts vs. The Skids&quot; EP in 1992 to promote their &quot;Three Minute Heroes&quot; compilation album. &quot;In a Rut&quot; and &quot;Babylon&#x27;s Burning&quot; were lined up against the Skids&#x27; &quot;Into the Valley&quot; and &quot;Working for the Yankee Dollar&quot;. &quot;Demolition Dancing&quot; (1994) was an album of live tracks recorded in 1979, two of which – &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; and &quot;In A Rut&quot; – featured members of the Damned. Also in 1994, the German record label Vince Lombardy Highschool Records released &quot;Rules&quot; which featured sixteen tracks by the Ruts and Ruts D.C., including &quot;Last Exit&quot;, a previously unreleased song.

1995 brought &quot;Something That I Said – The Best of the Ruts&quot; album (re-released in March 2003 and on EMI Gold in 2005).

&quot;Ruts: In a Can&quot; (2000) was an album of demos from three sessions in the period before they signed to Virgin, released in a metal tin. Fox, Jennings and Ruffy compiled and remastered this release, and also supplied liner notes. The sessions date from 25 April 1978 (8-track Fairdeal Sessions), 20 February 1979 (Underhill Studio) and Mystery Studio Sessions (early 1979).

In 2001, Virgin released &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out – The Essential Ruts Collection&quot; on CD. It included &quot;Denial&quot;, a previously unreleased instrumental track. &quot;Bustin&#x27; Out&quot; was rounded out with a twenty-minute interview with Jennings. The same year, the 2-disc CD &quot;Criminal Minds&quot; appeared on Snapper in the UK. The second disc was a reissue of &quot;Live and Loud!&quot; from 1987. Anagram Records came up with a collection of unreleased tracks and alternate versions for their sixteen-track CD, &quot;In a Rut&quot; in 2002 (reissued 2008). The compilation included a snippet of John Peel praising &quot;In a Rut&quot;, and offering to help listeners obtain a copy if it is not available in their local record shop.

&quot;Babylon&#x27;s Burning Reconstructed&quot; (2005) was an album-long tribute to the band&#x27;s most famous song, remixed sixteen different times by Die Toten Hosen, Don Letts, Dreadzone and the Groove Corporation. The wide range of remixes included beatbox, drum and bass and ambient reworkings.

Fox came out of semi-retirement to play Ruts songs as Foxy&#x27;s Ruts with his son, Lawrence, on drums. Foxy&#x27;s Ruts supported Bad Manners on their Christmas tour of the UK in December 2006.

Two retrospective live albums appeared in 2006. &quot;Get Out of It!!&quot; featured eighteen songs including a sexually-themed early number by the band, &quot;Gotta Little Number&quot; (also titled &quot;Stepping Bondage&quot;) from a London Marquee show on 19 July 1979 (these recordings have also surfaced as &quot;Marquee 1979&quot; and &quot;Ruts 1979 – Marquee Club&quot;). &quot;Live at Deeply Vale&quot;, featured thirteen songs from a July 1978 performance recorded at the free Deeply Vale festival that was held annually near Bury, Greater Manchester.

===2007 reform===
On 16 July 2007, the band reformed for the first time in 27 years, and played a benefit gig for Fox, following his diagnosis of lung cancer. Henry Rollins stood in for Owen. They were supported by Tom Robinson, the Damned, Misty in Roots, UK Subs, Splodge (Splodgenessabounds), John Otway; and the Peafish House Band. Fox died on 21 October of the same year, at the age of 56.

On 25 January 2008, Henry Rollins presented &quot;The Gig&quot;, a short film about the 2007 benefit gig at London&#x27;s Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. The event, in support of Macmillan Cancer Support, was accompanied by live performances from Alabama 3, T. V. Smith, members of the Members, the Damned&#x27;s Captain Sensible and Beki Bondage.

In June 2008, another compilation, &quot;Original Punks&quot;, was released by Music Club Deluxe in the UK. The two-disc set included demos, alternate versions and live tracks plus songs recorded by Ruts D.C.

In December 2008 John &quot;Segs&quot; Jennings and Dave Ruffy returned to Ariwa Studios as Ruts D.C to record some new tracks with Neil &quot;Mad Professor&quot; Fraser. The project, entitled &quot;Rhythm Collision Vol. 2&quot;, was mixed in Brighton by Mike &quot;Prince Fatty&quot; Pelanconi and was finally released in 2013.

The band enlisted Leigh Heggarty on guitar, Seamus Beaghan on Hammond organ, and Molara on additional vocals and percussion, and completed some British dates supporting Alabama 3 in November and December 2011. The band also played the Rebellion Festival in August 2012, at the Empress Ballroom in Blackpool, Lancashire, alongside Rancid, Buzzcocks, Goldblade, Social Distortion, Public Image Ltd and a reformed Anti-Pasti amongst others.

<doc id="1097074" wikidata="Q840368" url="?curid=1097074" title="Jill Valentine">
<text>is a character in &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (&quot;Biohazard&quot; in Japan), a survival horror series created by the Japanese company Capcom. She was introduced as one of two player characters in the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (1996) with her partner, Chris Redfield, as a member of the Raccoon City Police Department&#x27;s Special Tactics And Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) unit. Jill and Chris fight the Umbrella Corporation, a pharmaceutical company whose bioterrorism creates zombies and other bio-organic weapons, and later become founding members of the United Nations&#x27; Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).

Jill is the protagonist of several &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games, novelizations and films and has appeared in other game franchises, including &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom&quot;, &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, &quot;Teppen&quot;, and &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot;. In later games, such as the 2002 &quot;Resident Evil&quot; remake, &quot;The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; (2007), &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Mercenaries 3D&quot; (2011), her features were based on Canadian model and actress Julia Voth. Several actresses have portrayed Jill, including Sienna Guillory and Hannah John-Kamen in the live-action &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films.

Video game publications described Jill as among the most popular and iconic video game characters, and praised her as the most likable and consistent &quot;Resident Evil&quot; character. She has received acclaim and criticism with regard to gender representation in video games. Several publications praised the series for its portrayal of women, and considered Jill significantly less sexualized than other female game characters; she was also cited as an example of a female character who was as competent as her male counterparts. Others said that she was weakened as a protagonist by attributes which undermined her role as a heroinespecifically, an unrealistic body shape which did not reflect her military background. Some of Jill&#x27;s overtly-sexualized costumes have also been criticized.

==Concept and design==
Jill was introduced as one of two playable protagonists with her partner, Chris Redfield, in Capcom&#x27;s 1996 survival horror video game &quot;Resident Evil.&quot; She was created by director Shinji Mikami and designer Isao Ohishi. To avoid the sexual objectification of women in video games, Mikami refused to eroticize or depict women as submissive in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;; Jill was characterized as independent.

Of Japanese and French descent, she excelled at bomb disposal during her training with Delta Force and later joined the Special Tactics and Rescue Service (S.T.A.R.S.) special operations unit. Experienced with weapons, explosives and lock picking, she was intelligent, brave, and loyal. Although their storylines progress in &quot;the same general direction&quot;, the gameplay differs for Jill and Chris; her inventory is larger and she has a lock-pick, giving her early access to more health and ammunition. Based on these differences, Jill was recommended for first-time players of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. Game designer Jun Takeuchi gave each character a unique clothing style to make them instantly recognisable, with Jill&#x27;s character wearing a distinctive blue beret.

According to digital media scholar Esther MacCallum-Stewart, Mikami&#x27;s female characters possess unique qualities (making them viable choices for players, instead of their male counterparts and their combat attire helped them avoid criticism for catering to the male gaze. Mikami said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve put more emphasis on women characters, but when I do introduce them, it is never as objects. In [other] games, they will be peripheral characters with ridiculous breast physics. I avoid that sort of obvious eroticism.&quot; Despite this, subsequent games in the series not directed by Mikami depicted Jill in revealing costumes. Media scholars said that players have been encouraged to objectify and identify with the character, and several suggested that Mikami&#x27;s initial portrayal of Jill as a military professional tempered the ability of subsequent game directors to overtly sexualize the character.

Jill was redesigned over the course of the series; in the 2002 remake of the original game, her appearance was based on Canadian model and actress Julia Voth. Capcom producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi said that they made her more &quot;kawaii&quot; in the remake, but kept her tough and muscular. Voth was reused for &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; (2007) and &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; (2009). &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; has Chris as a protagonist, and its designers opted to focus on how both characters had aged since the original game. Jill underwent another redesign for &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; to reflect her status as a test subject in biological research experiments. Depicted with blonde hair, pale skin, and a tight-fitting outfitdescribed as a battle suither changes represent the effects of the experiments. Fans criticized the new appearance as an example of whitewashing. MacCallum-Stewart suggested that the series&#x27; popularity was damaged by the unexplained reappearance of Jill as a &quot;mind-controlled BDSM assassin&quot;. In the 2020 remake of &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot;, the character is based on Russian model Sasha Zotova. Jill&#x27;s redesign reflects the developers&#x27; vision behind her reimagination as an action hero; because the art direction for the remake is based on photorealism, Capcom wanted to ensure that Jill fit into the game-world environment.

Alternate costumes as rewards for players have been a staple of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. Completing the 2002 remake unlocked the ability to dress Jill in her &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot; miniskirt costume and as Sarah Connor in the 1991 film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The miniskirt was added during development at the staff&#x27;s request; developers changed camera angles to reduce upskirting, matching the colors of the skirt and underwear to make any upskirting less obvious. The outfit reappeared in &quot;Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D&quot; (2011). A prequel to the events of &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, the downloadable content (DLC) episode &quot;Lost in Nightmares&quot; includes an alternative outfit for Jill which was based on military clothing and sportswear. Since &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations&quot; (2012) was set at sea, her costume resembled a wetsuit. The initial design featured more tactical gear attached to her buoyancy control device, but it was removed to highlight her physical contours. Her alternate outfit in the game, a revealing pirate costume, was colorful to contrast with the storyline&#x27;s dark themes.

===Voice-over and live-action actresses===
The actresses who appeared in the original game&#x27;s live-action cutscenes and recorded the voice work were credited only by their first names; Jill was played by &quot;Inezh&quot;, a high school student. Voice actresses who played Jill included Catherine Disher in &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot;, Heidi Anderson in the 2002 remake, Kathleen Barr in Capcom&#x27;s 2004 action-adventure game &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, and Tara Platt in &quot;Pachislot Biohazard&quot; (an arcade game released in Japan). Patricia Ja Lee provided the voice and motion capture for &quot;The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;. Kari Wahlgren voiced the character in the 2011 game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;. Jill was voiced in &quot;Revelations&quot; by Michelle Ruff, who returned for the non-canon game &quot;Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City&quot;. Nicole Tompkins voiced and provided motion capture for Jill in the 2020 &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot; remake, and reprised her role in the CG animated film &quot;Resident Evil: Death Island&quot;. Atsuko Yuya voiced Jill in the Japanese versions of the games.

The character appeared in three entries of the original &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film series, where she was played by English actress Sienna Guillory. Hannah John-Kamen played the role in the 2021 film, &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot;.

==Appearances==
===In the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series===
Each game in the series is set in the fictional American metropolis of Raccoon City until its destruction at the end of &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;. Subsequent games with Jill are set in Russia Africa, and on the Mediterranean Sea. The original game is set in July 1998 in a mansion on the outskirts of Raccoon City, which Jill and her team enter while searching for their colleagues. Working with partner Barry Burton, she discovers that the mansion is a façade for a biological warfare laboratory operated by the Umbrella Corporation; its undead occupants are scientists who developed the T-virus mutagen. Her commander, Albert Wesker, is a double agent for Umbrella. Jill and Chris are among five survivors of the incident, who form a strong friendship and become passionate opponents of bioterrorism.

Jill did not appear in &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; (1998), as the production team used new protagonists (Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield) to preserve the original game&#x27;s horror elements; Mikami thought that Jill and Chris would be too experienced to be frightened by the sequel&#x27;s events. She returned as the sole protagonist in &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot; (1999). Mikami – the lead producer of &quot;Nemesis&quot; and the concurrently-produced &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; (2000) – wanted each game to highlight a female character who had previously appeared in the series; Jill is the protagonist in &quot;Nemesis&quot;, and Claire is the lead character in &quot;Code: Veronica&quot;. Observers suggested that these decisions were made as a result of the success of the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; series, with Lara Croft as the protagonist.

&quot;Nemesis&quot; is set two months after the first game, when Jill joins the Raccoon City Police Department (RCPD) to protect as many civilians as possible from the T-virus. The reason given by Capcom for her informal clothing in this entry was her resignation from the police immediately before the city was infected with the virus. Jill quit in protest over the failure of law enforcement to take action against Umbrella, but remained in the city to investigate the corporation. The police uniform she wore in the original game was replaced with a less-formal blue tube top, black miniskirt, and knee-high boots.

In &quot;Nemesis&quot;, Jill escapes Raccoon City before its destruction by a nuclear strike as part of a U.S. government cover-up. She is pursued by Nemesis, a supersoldier tasked with killing the remaining S.T.A.R.S. team members. Instead of killing Jill, Nemesis infects her with the T-virus; her new partner, Carlos Oliveira – a former Umbrella mercenary – cures her of the infection with an Umbrella-produced vaccine. &quot;The Umbrella Chronicles&quot; is set in 2003, when Jill and Chris join a private organization to expose Umbrella&#x27;s biological-warfare activities (leading a group to destroy their only remaining research facility). After the fall of the corporation, Jill and Carlos become founding members of the United Nations&#x27; Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA). In &quot;Revelations&quot; – set two years later – Jill and new partner Parker Luciani are sent to rescue Chris, who is allegedly being held hostage on a ghost ship in the Mediterranean. Once aboard, she discovers that the ship is infested with a new type of mutagen capable of infecting the aquatic ecosystem. Jill and Chris unravel a political conspiracy involving an earlier mutagenic outbreak and a botched investigation by a rival agency.

&quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; takes place in 2009 in the fictional African town of Kijuju, where terrorists are turning local residents into zombies. One of these terrorists is Jill, who was missing in action for the previous two-and-a-half years. Set in 2006, the &quot;Lost in Nightmares&quot; DLC has Jill and Chris searching a mansion for Umbrella&#x27;s founder; to save Chris from Wesker, Jill tackles Wesker through a window. Neither body is recovered, and Jill is declared dead. She was actually injured by the fall and taken hostage by Wesker, who then uses her as a test subject in his biological experiments. The antibodies produced by Jill&#x27;s system as a result of her &quot;Nemesis&quot;-era T-virus infection are the basis for the Uroboros Virus, the catalyst for the events of &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;.

During &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;, Chris discovers that Jill is alive; Wesker attached a mind-control device to her which forces her to commit terrorist acts and fight Chris and his new partner, local BSAA agent Sheva Alomar. Jill has enough self-control to open her outfit so the device can be seen and removed. After its removal, she explains that she knew what she was doing but was unable to control her actions and urges Chris and Sheva to continue their mission. Another DLC episode, &quot;Desperate Escape&quot;, describes how Jill escaped safely with the help of local BSAA agent Josh Stone before they help Chris and Sheva kill Wesker.

===Other appearances===

The character appears in several &quot;Resident Evil&quot; films. She was scheduled to be the protagonist of the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; movie (2002), under the direction of George A. Romero. When Paul W. S. Anderson took over from Romero, he created a new character for the film series: Alice, played by Milla Jovovich. Jill appears in the 2004 sequel, &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, as a disgraced police officer who escapes the ruins of Raccoon City with the help of Alice and other survivors. Her outfit in the film is based on her clothing from &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot;. Anderson considered describing the costume as an undercover outfit, and Jovovich suggested a heat wave as the explanation. Anderson eventually decided to ignore the issue altogether, saying that people who criticized her attire &quot;probably shouldn&#x27;t be watching a &quot;Resident Evil&quot; movie [at all].&quot;

Jill appears in a post-credits scene in &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot; (2010), wearing the mind-controlling device from &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot; and leading an attack against Alice, Chris, Claire, and the survivors they rescued after a viral outbreak in Los Angeles. In &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot; (2012), she is an antagonist programmed to capture Alice who regains control of herself after Alice removes Wesker&#x27;s mind-control device. The film includes a fight between Jill and Alice with about 200 moves. She did not appear in the final film, &quot;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter&quot; (2016), apparently dying offscreen. According to Jovovich, Jill was excluded because there were too many other &quot;Resident Evil&quot; characters. The &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film series received consistently-negative reviews; &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; praised Guillory&#x27;s performance in &quot;Apocalypse&quot; as the film&#x27;s only highlight. In the reboot film &quot;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&quot; (2021), Jill is played by Hannah John-Kamen. She has also appeared in the 2023 animated film, &quot;Resident Evil: Death Island&quot;. Jill&#x27;s youthful appearance in the film, despite being 40 years old, was said to be a result of the T-virus slowing her aging.

She is a playable character in several non-canonical &quot;Resident Evil&quot; games. The character appears in a number of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; mobile games and is the protagonist of &quot;Resident Evil: Genesis&quot; (2008), an alternative-story version of the original game. Jill is a playable character in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; (2000), &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; (2011), &quot;Project X Zone&quot; (2012), &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot; (2015), &quot;Dead by Daylight&quot; (2016), &quot;Puzzle Fighter&quot; (2017), and the digital collectible card game &quot;Teppen&quot; (2019). She is an alternate skin for Chun-Li in &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot; (1998), Cammy in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; (2016), and Zofia in &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division 2&quot; (2019), and can be selected as a playable skin in &quot;We Love Golf!&quot; (2007), &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Rainbow Six Siege&quot; (2015), and &quot;Fortnite Battle Royale&quot; (2017). Jill has a non-playable cameo in 2004&#x27;s &quot;Under the Skin&quot;, is one of the &#x27;Spirit&#x27; power-ups in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; (2018), and a robot dressed as Jill makes a brief reference in &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot; (2020) and &quot;Astro Bot&quot; (2024).

Jill appears in novelizations of the films and games and plays a supporting role in the first novel, &quot;Resident Evil: Caliban Cove&quot; (1998), of a series by S. D. Perry. In &quot;Resident Evil: The Umbrella Conspiracy&quot; (1998), Perry&#x27;s novelization of the original game, Jill&#x27;s Delta Force background is not mentioned; before her career in law enforcement, she is said to have acted as an accomplice for her father Dick Valentine, a professional thief. Several comic books based on the games were released, and she is a character in Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil Deck Building Card Game&quot; (2011). Merchandise featuring Jill includes action figures, figurines and a replica gun. The character was featured in &quot;Resident Evil&quot;-themed attractions at Universal Studios Japan and Universal Orlando&#x27;s Halloween Horror Nights. Capcom&#x27;s theme restaurant, Biohazard Cafe &amp; Grill S.T.A.R.S., which opened in Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya in 2012, served a noodle dish named for her.

==Reception and legacy==

Game publications, including the 2011 version of the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, described Jill Valentine as among the most popular and iconic video-game characters. At the 2013 Penny Arcade Expo, journalists and game developers named her one of the top three lead characters in Western and Japanese role-playing video games. Magazines praised her as the most likable &quot;Resident Evil&quot; character, with the series&#x27; most believable and consistent story arc. The character was cited as one of the video game industry&#x27;s greatest mascots, a tough, strong, attractive female character who could appeal to a broad demographic.

Critics noted that Jill was not oversexualized in her early appearances. She was highlighted as an example of the series&#x27; female characters who were not judged solely on gender, and for having &quot;the most sensible design&quot; for a female character of the mid-to-late 1990s. Her professional relationship with Chris was praised for its basis in loyalty rather than romance and its balance of personalities: Jill&#x27;s intellect and Chris&#x27;s brawn. Female digital critics felt that several of Jill&#x27;s features undermine her role as a heroine and weaken her as a protagonist; her body shape is unrealistic and not reflective of her military background or physical training, and she was the only member of her team in the original game to not wear a bulletproof vest. The extent to which her appearance changed over the course of the game series has been criticized as excessive, with the &quot;Resident Evil 3&quot; outfit derided for deviating too much from Mikami&#x27;s initial militaristic depiction of the character. In &quot;Tropes vs. Women in Video Games&quot;, feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian criticized Jill&#x27;s alternate costumes as too revealing (particularly the pirate costume in &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations&quot;). Sarkeesian cited Jill&#x27;s movement in &quot;Revelations&quot; as an example of female characters who walk in an overtly-sexualized manner.

MacCallum-Stewart said that the first &quot;Resident Evil&quot; game became famous for its &quot;extremely clunky dialogue and voice acting, an element which lent the otherwise suspenseful game an element of charm that endeared it to players&quot;. Although weak dialogue might be attributed to poor translation of the original Japanese text, she said that this inadvertently helped to differentiate the series from its rivals. Several lines from the game achieved enduring popularity; &quot;You were almost a Jill sandwich&quot;, a quip delivered in awkward voiceover by Barry Burton after a falling ceiling trap almost crushes Jill, was revived as an Internet meme a decade after the game&#x27;s release and became the subject of fan art depicting Jill in (or as) a sandwich. Capcom used the line in several of their later games, including &quot;Dead Rising&quot; (2006), &quot;Resident Evil: Uprising&quot; (2009), &quot;Resident Evil: Revelations 2&quot; (2015), and &quot;Resident Evil: Resistance&quot; (2020). Another piece of dialogue by Burton – &quot;And, Jill, here&#x27;s a lock pick. It might be handy if you, the master of unlocking, take it with you&quot; – also became popular. The quote, parodied for its excessive silence between words, was removed from later editions.

<text>Marcus Albert Foster (March 31, 1923 – November 6, 1973) was an American educator who gained a national reputation for educational excellence while serving as principal of Simon Gratz High School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (1966–1969), as Associate Superintendent of Schools in Philadelphia (1969–1970), and as the first black superintendent of a large city school district. He was appointed in 1970 as Superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District in Oakland, California. Foster was assassinated in 1973 by members of the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), a newly founded leftist terrorist group.

== Early life and education ==
Marcus Albert Foster was born in Athens, Georgia, the youngest of five children. When he was three, his family moved to Philadelphia, joining the Great Migration of African Americans out of the South. Raised by a single mother, he attended public schools in Philadelphia, graduating from South Philadelphia High School. One of his grandfathers was a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), and Foster&#x27;s mother Alice stressed education for all her children. She encouraged his mastery of Standard English. She highlighted its importance as the dominant syntax.

As a young man, Foster was both exceptionally scholastic and rebellious, opting to frequent the Club Ziger where one had to &quot;smoke a stogie and drink a lot of wine to get in.&quot; Furthermore, as a member of the Trojans, a neighborhood men&#x27;s club, his comrade Frye noted Foster &quot;could hold his hands up&quot;. This broad range of youth experience aided Foster throughout his life, and he had an ability to connect with and inspire students of myriad backgrounds, while drawing together disparate adult groups advocating for alternative, at times oppositional, visions of social reform. He graduated in 1947 from Cheyney State College, a historically black university. He earned a Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) from the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League institution.

His first cousin, Justine Wilkinson Washington, also became a noted educator. 

== Career ==
From 1957 to 1970 Foster taught in the Philadelphia public schools, and served as principal of Dunbar Elementary School, O.V. Catto School for Boys, and Gratz High School. He was noted for his work at Gratz, where he was more successful than predecessors in inspiring the students. He also served as Associate Superintendent for Community Relations.

Foster moved to Oakland in 1970 when he was appointed Superintendent of Oakland Public Schools. He was one of the first black superintendents of any major urban school system. Robert Blackburn, a white colleague in Philadelphia, followed him and was appointed as a deputy superintendent.

Foster became highly respected in Oakland, negotiating in a volatile environment with numerous groups and people of various political orientations. He worked to raise the success of students in the minority-majority schools, where many families struggled with poverty.

There had been a record voter turnout in the May 1973 election for mayor, a part-time position. Republican incumbent John H. Reading won a third four-year term by defeating Democrat Bobby Seale, a co-founder of the Black Panthers and advocate of social programs. Foster worked with the groups they represented and also within the environment of a state governed by conservative Republican Ronald Reagan.

== Death ==
Foster was shot dead on November 6, 1973, and his deputy Robert Blackburn was wounded, as they left a school board meeting. Members of an unknown group calling itself the Symbionese Liberation Army claimed responsibility. The SLA sent letters to media claiming that they killed Foster because of his alleged support of a plan to require a student identification card system in Oakland, which they called &quot;fascist&quot;. The proposed program was intended to reduce vagrancy and keep non-student drug-dealers off campus, and Foster had already gained support from the board to modify it to meet community concerns.

Foster was shot eight times with hollow-point bullets that had been packed with cyanide, a detail that the police did not initially publicize so it could be used as a calling card if necessary. Blackburn was wounded but survived. Police originally discounted the flyers from the unknown SLA, but when the group noted the cyanide in the bullets, law enforcement realized they had a claim. The group was later classified as terrorist based on actions including kidnapping and armed robberies.

Foster is buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. His widow, Albertine Ramseur Foster, died on December 27, 2011. She was buried alongside him. Their daughter, Marsha Foster Boyd, is President Emerita of Ecumenical Theological Seminary in Detroit, Michigan.

== Honors and tributes ==
Foster received the prestigious Philadelphia Award in 1969, which recognizes individuals who have made positive contributions to the city of Philadelphia. After his death, several sites were named in his honor. These included the athletic fields at Gratz High School and the Marcus Foster Indoor Pool in Philadelphia, and the Student Union building at Cheyney University, his alma mater.

In 1973 Foster had founded the Oakland Education Institute, to raise discretionary funds to promote excellence in Oakland schools through the collaborative efforts of Oakland&#x27;s diverse communities. After his death, the Institute was renamed the Marcus A. Foster Education Institute in his honor. In conjunction with Oakland-area businesses, the Institute awards 60 yearly scholarships ranging from $1000 to $2000 to Oakland high school students. Over 1,500 students have received these scholarships. The Fund also regularly awards up to $2000 to Oakland public school teachers who develop innovative educational projects.

In 1975, the Association of California School Administrators (ACSA) established the Marcus Foster Memorial Award for Administrator Excellence, which is given annually to an ACSA member who personifies the ideals of Marcus Foster. Recipients of this award receive a $5,000 grant for a designated high school senior or seniors.

The School District of Philadelphia in 2005 established the Marcus A. Foster Award, which is given annually to a School District administrator for noteworthy contributions in curriculum, instruction, school improvement or administration.

Both the University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Berkeley Graduate Schools of Education established Marcus Foster Fellowships.

During the state-mandated program to retrofit all schools for earthquake safety in the 1970s (and replace some that needed it), the Oakland portion was named the Marcus Foster Earthquake Safe program.

== Aftermath ==

After deputy Robert Blackburn recovered from the shooting, he was appointed as Acting Superintendent of Oakland Schools. Beginning in 1981, he taught Educational Leadership at California State University, Hayward, in the East Bay, and later also at University of California, Berkeley.

Escaped convict Donald DeFreeze became known as the SLA spokesman as the group gained notoriety. Patricia Soltysik and Nancy Ling Perry were founding members with him and shared leadership; they were posited as the group&#x27;s main theorists. By November 1973 and this killing, DeFreeze was the only black member of the small group; the remainder were younger white radicals, most of whom were middle or upper-class, and many of whom had college degrees.

Arrested in January 1974 and convicted of being involved in the attack on Foster, founding SLA members Joe Remiro and Russ Little were sentenced to life in prison. Little was released after being acquitted on a new trial gained on appeal; he had served five years in prison. Remiro remains incarcerated serving a life sentence; his requests for parole have been rejected.

Later Little said that Soltysik had fatally shot Foster, and Perry had fired at Blackburn but &quot;botched that&quot;. DeFreeze wounded Blackburn with a shotgun.

In May 1974, six SLA members sought refuge in Los Angeles. There was an SLA shootout with the LAPD at a house there. DeFreeze committed suicide as the structure burned down around them. Soltysik, Perry and three other founding members of the SLA also died that day.

<text>Lilyfield is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Lilyfield is located 6 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Inner West Council.

Lilyfield is nestled in between the suburbs of Annandale, Rozelle and Leichhardt and is bounded to the west by Iron Cove. Originally a working-class area, today Lilyfield like many inner-city suburbs is becoming increasingly gentrified. Property investors, eager to capitalise on the suburb&#x27;s proximity to the Sydney CBD, have purchased many of the original workers&#x27; cottages to renovate or develop. 

==History==
Popular belief has it that the area was once farmland and was named for the lilies that reportedly grew in the fields. However, its name origin remains unclear. Lilyfield was originally part of the suburb of Leichhardt.

The most dominant landmark in the area is the former Callan Park hospital. This was built on land acquired from the Callan Estates, a property between Balmain Road and Iron Cove. A psychiatric hospital was designed by James Barnet, the government architect, based on an asylum in Kent and utilising the principles of Dr Kirkbride, an American psychiatrist. Completed in 1884, the hospital was known until 1914 as the Callan Park Hospital for the Insane; the main part of the hospital, a cluster of sandstone buildings, was called the Kirkbride complex.

More recently, the Kirkbride complex became the home of the Sydney College of the Arts, and the hospital functions were confined to the western buildings. This is now known as Rozelle Hospital. The Kirkbride complex is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

After the construction of the City West Link Road in the 1990s, the suburb was effectively split into two parts. One half on the Rozelle side of the road, the other half on the Leichhardt side. This dramatic change in the geography did much to disrupt the sense of community in the relatively secluded suburb and almost led to its being subsumed into the neighbouring suburbs.

Orange Grove is a small locality within Lilyfield. Centred around Orange Grove Plaza, the locality shares its name with a primary school, market, and pub. The locality is served by the Inner West Light Rail.

== Heritage listings ==
Lilyfield has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Balmain Road: Callan Park Hospital for the Insane
* Balmain Road: Broughton Hall
* Piper Street: White&#x27;s Creek Aqueduct

* 68.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common other countries of birth were England 5.9% and New Zealand 2.6%. 
* 78.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 2.9% and Greek 1.8%. 
* The most common responses for religion were no religion 49.0% and Catholic 22.7%.

==Transport==

Lilyfield is served by the Inner West Light Rail, with a stop on Catherine Street. The station, situated on a former goods railway line, opened in 2000. The stop was the western terminus of the light rail until 2014, when the line was extended along the route of the former goods line to Dulwich Hill. Lilyfield was also the terminus of a tram line in the original Sydney tram system.

<doc id="1097081" wikidata="Q6962593" url="?curid=1097081" title="Nancy Cato">
<text>Nancy Fotheringham Cato (11 March 19173 July 2000) was an Australian writer who published more than twenty historical novels, biographies and volumes of poetry. Cato is also known for her work campaigning on environmental and conservation issues.

==Life==

Cato was born in Glen Osmond in South Australia, and was a fifth-generation Australian. She studied English literature and Italian at the University of Adelaide, graduating in 1939, then completed a two-year course at the South Australian School of Arts. She was a cadet journalist on &quot;The News&quot; from 1935 to 1941, and an art critic from 1957 to 1958.

Cato married Eldred De Bracton Norman, and travelled extensively overseas with him. They had one daughter and two sons. Cato died at Noosa Heads on 3 July 2000.

Cato&#x27;s cousin was also named Nancy Cato, and was host of children&#x27;s TV show the &quot;Magic Circle Club&quot; in the mid-1960s.

==Literary career==

With Roland Robinson and Kevin Collopy, in 1948 Cato was one of the founding members of the &quot;Lyre-Bird Writers&quot;, an independent and cooperative group that formed to publish verse by Australian writers. As a member of the Jindyworobak Movement, Cato edited the 1950 &quot;Jindyworobak Anthology&quot;, one of a series of anthologies produced to promote indigenous Australian ideas and customs, particularly in poetry. She was actively involved in the Fellowship of Australian Writers and the Australian Society of Authors during the 1950s and 1960s.

Cato&#x27;s most famous work is her trilogy, known as &quot;All the Rivers Run&quot;. It was originally published as three separate volumes: &quot;All the Rivers Run&quot; (1958), &quot;Time, Flow Softly&quot; (1959) and &quot;But Still the Stream&quot; (1962). However, since the 1970s it has been generally published as one large volume containing the three books. It was made into a TV mini-series &quot;All the Rivers Run&quot;, which was broadcast in 1983.

Cato&#x27;s other books include: &quot;Green Grows The Vine&quot;, &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; and &quot;Mister Maloga&quot;, which tells the story of Daniel Matthews and his Maloga Mission to Aboriginal people on the Murray River in Victoria.

Her book on unplanned development (environmental vandalism) in her home town of Noosa was first published in 1979. Three editions have been published to acclaim.

==Honours and recognition==

Cato became a local icon in the Noosa area of Queensland, and has a park and restaurant named after her. The Noosa Parks Association made her a life member and an honorary park ranger for her work in conservation.

In 1984, she was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for services to literature and the environment, and she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the University of Queensland in 1991.

In 2006 a new suburb of Franklin was proposed for Canberra with the streets named after Australian women writers. The suburb now includes &quot;Nancy Cato Street&quot;.

* 1961 NT Poetry Prize

<text>Malcolm Margolin (born October 27, 1940) is an author, publisher, and former executive director of Heyday Books, an independent nonprofit publisher and cultural institution in Berkeley, California. From his founding of Heyday in 1974 until his retirement at the end of 2015, he oversaw the publication of several hundred books and the creation of two quarterly magazines: &quot;News from Native California,&quot; devoted to the history and ongoing cultural concerns of California Indians, and &quot;Bay Nature,&quot; devoted to the natural history of the San Francisco Bay Area. In the fall of 2017, he established a new enterprise, the California Institute for Community, Art, and Nature (California ICAN) to continue and expand upon the work that he began more than forty years ago.

Margolin is the author/editor of several books including &quot;The Ohlone Way: Indian Life in the San Francisco-Monterey Bay Area&quot;, named by the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; as one of the hundred most important books of the twentieth century by a western writer. His essays and articles have appeared in a number of periodicals including &quot;The Nation,&quot; the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Margolin was born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 27, 1940 to a Lithuanian mother and an American father. He attended Boston Latin School and Harvard University, where he earned a degree in English Literature in 1964. He met his wife Rina while attending Harvard; she was a psychology major at Radcliffe College.

After college he lived in Puerto Rico (1964–1966) and New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side (1966–1968). He visited Yosemite National Park in the summer of 1967. In 1969, he moved with Rina to California.

== Career ==

Margolin has lectured widely and has served as advisor and mentor to many other publishers. In addition to founding Heyday (1974), News from Native California (1987), and Bay Nature (2001), he co-founded the Alliance for California Traditional Arts (1997), an organization devoted to California folk arts, and has served on its board since its beginning. In 2001, he co-founded Inlandia Institute, a literary center in Riverside, California.

He currently serves on the Publication Committee of the Book Club of California and devotes time and effort to a number of environmental, cultural, and social justice organizations and causes.

== Personal life ==
He has lived in Berkeley, California since the late 1960s, where he and his wife, Rina, have raised three children: Reuben (1970), Sadie (1974), and Jacob (1980).

<doc id="1097107" wikidata="Q2117265" url="?curid=1097107" title="Red Delicious">
<text>Red Delicious is a variety of apple with a red exterior and sweet taste that was first recognized in Madison County, Iowa, in 1872. Today, the name &quot;Red Delicious&quot; comprises more than 50 cultivars (cultivated varieties). It was the most produced apple cultivar in the United States from 1968 until 2018, when it was surpassed by Gala. It also lost that title in Canada at around the same time.

==Origins==
The Red Delicious originated at an orchard in 1872 as &quot;a round, blushed yellow fruit of surpassing sweetness&quot; by chance seedling. Stark Nurseries held a competition in 1892 to find an apple to replace the &#x27;Black Ben Davis&#x27; apple. The winner was a red and yellow striped apple sent by Jesse Hiatt, a farmer in Peru, Iowa, who called it &quot;Hawkeye&quot; in honor of his home state. Stark Nurseries bought the rights from Hiatt, renamed the variety &quot;Stark Delicious&quot;, and began propagating it. Another apple tree, later named the &#x27;Golden Delicious&#x27;, was also marketed by Stark Nurseries after it was purchased from a farmer in Clay County, West Virginia, in 1914; the &#x27;Delicious&#x27; became the &#x27;Red Delicious&#x27; as a retronym.

== Rise and fall in demand ==

The Red Delicious originally became popular thanks to not just its visual appeal but also its durability in storage, making transportation easy. Starting in the 1950s, changes in grocery buying habits led to consumers prioritizing visual appearance. As a result, commercial growers increasingly selected for longer storage and cosmetic appeal rather than flavor. Consumers at that time associated redness with ripeness. But the selection of redder fruit caused deselection of flavor, and the genes that produced the yellow stripes on the original fruit were on the same chromosomes as those for the flavor-producing compounds. Breeding for uniformity and long shelf life favored a thicker skin.While the Red Delicious had enjoyed moderate success in the market place, its popularity only took off in the mid-twentieth century. It became the most popular apple in the United States during the 1940s. By the 1980s, Red Delicious represented three-quarters of the harvest in Washington State. Nevertheless, the selection for beauty and long storage over taste was not popular among consumers. Later, as other cultivars entered supermarkets, demand for the Red Delicious declined. Modern consumers tend to prefer sweeter and crunchier varieties. By the 1990s, reliance on the now-unwanted Red Delicious had helped to push Washington state&#x27;s apple industry &quot;to the edge&quot; of collapse. In 2000, Congress approved and President Bill Clinton signed a bill to bail out the apple industry, after apple growers had lost $760 million since 1997.

Farmers began to replace their orchards with other cultivars such as Gala, Fuji, and Honeycrisp. By 2000, this cultivar made up less than one half of the Washington state output, and in 2003, the crop had shrunk to 37% of the state&#x27;s harvest, which totaled 103 million boxes. Although Red Delicious still remained the single largest variety produced in the state in 2005, others were growing in popularity, notably the Fuji and Gala varieties. By 2014 the Washington Apple Commission was recommending growers plan to export 60% or more of production. In 2018, the Gala overtook the Red Delicious in U.S. sales for the first time. According to the U.S. Apple Association, production of the Gala grew 5.8% in 2018 compared to the previous year, whereas that of the Red Delicious fell 11%. However, exporting the Red Delicious was still a viable option because other countries, notably India, still had high demand for the apple. The COVID-19 pandemic was projected to continue reducing demand for the Red Delicious as many cafeterias and other typical sales points for the apple were closed. Despite these challenges, during the mid-2020s, the Red Delicious remained one of the most produced apples in the United States.

==Sports (mutations)==
Over the years many propagable mutations, or sports, have been identified in &#x27;Red Delicious&#x27; apple trees.

=== Patented ===
In addition to those propagated without any patent applications (or cut out because they were seen as inferior), 42 sports have been patented in the United States:

In 1977, the application for #4159 noted the &quot;starchy and bland taste of some of the newer varieties&quot;.

The plant patent for #4926 promoted the sport as a dwarfing interstock, a dwarfing rootstock for pears, or to produce &quot;crab apple&quot;-sized &#x27;Delicious&#x27; apples.

<doc id="1097109" wikidata="Q5928482" url="?curid=1097109" title="Hudson's Bay point blanket">
<text>A Hudson&#x27;s Bay point blanket is a type of wool blanket traded by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) in British North America, now Canada and the United States, from 1779 to present. The blankets were typically traded to First Nations in exchange for beaver pelts as an important part of the North American fur trade. The blankets continue to be sold by Canada&#x27;s Hudson&#x27;s Bay department stores and have come to hold iconic status in the country.

== History ==

In the North American fur trade, by 1700, wool blankets accounted for more than 60 per cent of traded goods. French fur trader Germain Maugenest is thought to have advised the HBC to introduce point blankets.

Originally point blankets had a single stripe across each end, usually in blue or red. In the mid-1800s blankets began to be produced with a green stripe, red stripe, yellow stripe and indigo stripe on a white background; the four stripe colours were popular and easily produced using good colourfast dyes at that time. In 1798, a mill owner received a purchase order for &quot;30 pair[s] of 3 points to be striped with four colors (red, blue, green, yellow) according to your judgement.&quot; to be manufactured in Witney, Oxfordshire, a town famous for its woollen blankets since the Middle Ages.
From the early days of the fur trade, wool blankets were made into hooded coats called capotes by both natives and French Canadian voyageurs, which were well-suited to Canada&#x27;s cold winters.

== Point system ==
Points are short black lines woven into the selvage of the blanket along the edge just above the bottom set of stripes. About in length (except in the case of half points, which are ), they indicate the finished overall size (area) of a blanket and allow easy determination of the size of a blanket even when folded. French weavers invented the point system in the mid-1700s since then, as now, blankets were shrunk as part of the manufacturing process. The word &quot;point&quot; derives from the French , meaning &quot;to make threaded stitches on cloth&quot;.

Over the centuries the sizes of blankets have shifted, particularly during the twentieth century as beds became larger. Blankets of 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 point were most common during the fur-trade era. Today, Hudson&#x27;s Bay blankets are commonly found in point sizes of 3.5 (twin bed), 4 (double), 6 (queen) and 8 (king).

The misconception persists that originally the points were an indication of a blanket&#x27;s price in beaver pelts or even its weight. The number of pelts required to buy a blanket ranged widely by time and location, regardless of its size. Thickness and quality are the same blanket to blanket, and a larger blanket will naturally weigh more.

==Mackinaw jacket==
In 1811, at Fort St. Joseph there was a shortage of greatcoats for the King&#x27;s soldiers. The date was November 20, 1811, and British Army Captain Charles Roberts, wrote a letter to Captain Evans, Adjutant General in Quebec, making a requisition, written as follows:

Roberts requisitioned HBC 3.5-point blankets from the British Indian Department to manufacture greatcoats for his troops. John Askin Jr., a Métis and keeper of the King&#x27;s stores at the fort, hired local women to design and manufacture forty woollen greatcoats. Everyone was in agreement that the newly tailored greatcoats were of superior quality than the British Army standard-issue greatcoats and helped to increase the morale of the King&#x27;s soldiers.
At the beginning of the War of 1812, Roberts and his men occupied Fort Michilimackinac located at the present-day Mackinaw City, Michigan. Roberts ordered a new supply of Hudson&#x27;s Bay point blankets for the upcoming winter to manufacture more greatcoats. This time Roberts had enlisted the aid of professional tailors and seamstresses to produce the greatcoats.

A despatch runner advised that the long length of the greatcoat was impractical for the deep snow drifts when travelling between Mackinaw and Montreal and requested it be replaced by the shorter double-breasted style, which became known as the Mackinaw jacket. At first, the Mackinaw jacket was produced in blue and was later replaced by the more popular red and black tartan pattern. The new design of the Mackinaw jacket was so beneficial for travelling through woods and trails that orders were received from people located from Fort William to Penetanguishene.

More than 100 years into the future, when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company began to commercially sell point blanket coats, the Mackinaw jacket remained popular with their customers.

== Current use ==
Versions of the blanket are available at Hudson&#x27;s Bay stores throughout Canada. Solid colours are available, as is the classic pattern featuring the green, red, yellow, and indigo stripes. The blankets have always been made in England; today they are made by John Atkinson, a sub brand of A.W. Hainsworth &amp; Sons Ltd.

Wools from Britain and New Zealand are used in the manufacture of blankets.

The official licensee allowed to import Hudson&#x27;s Bay Blankets into the United States for commercial sale is Woolrich Inc. of Pennsylvania. Four U.S. retailers sell the blankets to consumers: Woolrich, L.L.Bean, Getz&#x27;s Department Store in Marquette, Michigan, and Johnson Woolen Mills.

== Collectibility ==

Genuine point blankets have become very collectible and could fetch prices up to thousands of dollars. The main determinants of value include age, size, colour, pattern rarity and condition. Particularly collectible point blankets are the Coronation blankets: the one produced for the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II brings approximately $600 if in mint condition while examples of the even rarer 1937 coronation blanket have sold for as high as $1300.

In 1890, HBC began adding labels to their blankets because point blankets of similar quality were being sold by HBC competitors from such manufacturers as Early&#x27;s of Witney.

Harold Lee Tichenor, point blanket collector and consultant to Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, has written two books on point blankets and their collectability.

In April 2017, HBC updated the label, rotating it from vertical to horizontal, making it easy to display English and French on either side of the crest, which has been enhanced with red on the flag. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of Canada in 2017, HBC added an additional label to the blanket: a picture of voyageurs in a canoe, with &quot;Canada&quot; printed at the top.

On 2 May 2020, HBC celebrated its 350th anniversary. It re-released a series of special, limited-edition blankets in a variety of historic colourways and patterns. It added a &#x27;Special Edition&#x27; label with a picture of the sailing vessel &quot;Nonsuch&quot; and the words &#x27;Celebrating HBC&#x27;s 350th Anniversary&#x27;.

<doc id="1097118" wikidata="Q7400998" url="?curid=1097118" title="Saint Augustine Church (New Diggings, Wisconsin)">
<text>Saint Augustine Church is an early Catholic church built in 1844 in New Diggings, Wisconsin, during the area&#x27;s lead-mining boom. The building was designed by pioneer priest and amateur architect Father Samuel Mazzuchelli, and survives unchanged from that early era.

Carlo Gaetano Samuele Mazzuchelli was born in Milan, Italy in 1806. He entered the Dominican Order, came to America at age 22, and became a priest in 1830. Father Mazzuchelli served for five years in Upper Michigan and northern Wisconsin, then moved to the lead region, where he served as missionary and priest to many far-flung miners and settlers. Mazzuchelli established more than 35 parishes and designed buildings for 20 to 25 of them.

Saint Augustine parish was founded in 1835. The current building was constructed in 1844, designed by Father Mazzuchelli himself. The priest mixed styles in ways that a trained architect might not have, but the result is pleasing. Richard Perrin writes, &quot;This building...is one of the genuine architectural gems in the state of Wisconsin...an important element of Wisconsin&#x27;s cultural legacy.&quot;
The church is a small wooden structure on a limestone foundation. The general form of the building is Greek Revival, seen in the low-pitched roof and the cornice returns. But smaller elements are Gothic Revival: the pointed arches on the door and windows and in the corner pilasters, the pointed corbeling under the raking cornice. The walls are clad in 9-inch wood planks grooved to look like stone blocks. The exterior was never painted. On top is a spare bell tower styled like the rest of the church, topped with a small cross.

Inside the church are the original simple pews and finely carved altar rails. Three rooms behind the altar once provided living quarters for the priest whenever he stayed in the village. Father Mazzuchelli opened a school in these rooms in 1847 and staffed the small school with Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters.

In the 1960s some local Knights of Columbus began to restore the building. They rebuilt the foundation and replaced some parts of the bell tower. But after 120 years, they found much of the structure and wood sound. Since then the Father Mazzuchelli Assembly of the Knights of Columbus of Lancaster, Wisconsin has continued restoration.

Now in the Diocese of Madison, St. Augustine has not been an active parish for over a century. Some of Father Mazzuchelli&#x27;s other church buildings survive with modifications, but only this one remains unchanged. This gives the church a special historical connection to Father Mazzuchelli, and it remains a place of pilgrimage. The building is open on Sundays from 1 to 4 p.m., and a memorial Mass is held annually on the last Sunday of August. A number of historical artifacts, such as account books, records, letters, and other materials are preserved in the archives at Sinsinawa Mound in Sinsinawa, Wisconsin.

<text>USS &quot;Barney&quot; (DD–149) was a in the United States Navy during World War II, later redesignated AG-113. She was the second ship named for Commodore Joshua Barney.

&quot;Barney&quot; was launched on 5 September 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, Philadelphia, sponsored by Miss Nannie Dornin Barney, great-granddaughter of Commodore Barney. The ship was commissioned on 14 March 1919, Lieutenant Commander James L. Kauffman in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Barney&quot; reported to Division 19, Atlantic Fleet, and engaged in fleet exercises and maneuvers along the east coast until 30 June 1922, when she went out of commission at Philadelphia. Recommissioned on 1 May 1930, &quot;Barney&quot; operated with Destroyer Squadron, Scouting Force, on the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea until transiting the Panama Canal in February 1932 to participate in fleet problems off San Francisco. Remaining on the west coast, she operated for a time in reduced commission with Rotating Destroyer Squadron 20 Scouting Force. In 1935 she cruised with Destroyer Division 3 to Alaska thence to Honolulu, and later to the Puget Sound area for fleet problems.

Returning to the east coast, she conducted cruises with the 10th Training Squadron until November 1936, when she was placed out of commission. Recommissioned on 4 October 1939, she served on patrol duty with the 66th Division, Atlantic Squadron, and during the following year with the Inshore Patrol, 18th Naval District Defense Force.

Between December 1941 and November 1943, &quot;Barney&quot; was assigned to the Caribbean area, escorting convoys between Trinidad British West Indies; and Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. On 18 September 1942, she had a collision with the destroyer , resulting in severe damage and the loss of two of her crew by drowning. Both ships returned to Willemstad, Curaçao, Netherlands West Indies, where temporary repairs were made and then &quot;Barney&quot; departed for Charleston Navy Yard. Permanent repairs completed in December 1942, she returned to the Caribbean.

During 14 January–May 1944, &quot;Barney&quot; completed two convoy escort crossings to North Africa. From May 1944 until February 1945, she escorted convoys in the Caribbean. In March 1945, she was assigned to TE 25 and engaged in training exercises with submarines in Long Island and Block Island Sounds. On 30 June 1945, her classification was changed to AG-113. &quot;Barney&quot; was decommissioned on 30 November 1945 and sold for scrap on 13 October 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Barney&quot; received one battle star for her escort of Convoy UOS 37 (11 April 1944 – 12 April 1944).

<doc id="1097126" wikidata="Q3689948" url="?curid=1097126" title="Cool to Be You">
<text>Cool to Be You is the sixth studio album by the American punk rock band the Descendents, released on March 23, 2004, through Fat Wreck Chords. It was their first album of new studio material since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, which had been released through Epitaph Records. Following &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, singer Milo Aukerman had returned to his biochemistry career while the other members—bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson—had continued with their other band All, releasing two more studio albums and a live album through Epitaph between 1998 and 2001 with singer Chad Price. &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; was recorded with Aukerman in 2002, but its release was delayed until 2004. The band switched from Epitaph to Fat Wreck Chords partly due to the enthusiasm of label head Fat Mike, who cited the Descendents as one of his favorite bands. &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; became the fourth Descendents release to chart, reaching No. 143 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 6 amongst independent albums.

== Background and recording ==
In 1987 Descendents singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members—bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson—changed the band&#x27;s name to All and released eight albums on Cruz Records and Interscope Records between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. Aukerman contributed occasional songwriting and backing vocals, and in 1995 decided to return to music. The members decided to operate as two bands, working with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All. Both bands signed to Epitaph Records and the Descendents released &quot;Everything Sucks&quot; in 1996. Following the album&#x27;s supporting tours Aukerman had returned to his science career, though he recorded backing vocals for All&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Mass Nerder&quot;. All also released &quot;Problematic&quot; in 2000 and &quot;Live Plus One&quot; in 2001, a double live album that included a Descendents disc recorded in 1996.

The recording sessions for &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; took place with Aukerman in February 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with additional recording done in April at Planet of Sound in Wilmington, Delaware, and were produced by Stevenson. The band recorded the music for the songs live in the studio with minimal overdubbing, and Aukerman&#x27;s vocals were recorded over the instrumental tracks. However, these recordings were not released for another two years. Stevenson explained that the gap of eight years between Descendents albums was due to the band members having children and to his father&#x27;s death.

== Release ==
For the release of &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; the Descendents signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Label head and musician Fat Mike was a longtime fan of the band, and his enthusiasm for working with them was a major factor in their decision to sign to the label. Stevenson commented that &quot;If you&#x27;ve got the owner of the label saying he wants to put out a record by what is probably his favorite band of all time, that&#x27;s rad. That&#x27;s the best possible position for a band to be in.&quot; The album was preceded by the &quot;&#x27;Merican&quot; EP, released February 10, 2004 and featuring the tracks &quot;Nothing with You&quot; and Merican&quot; from the album as well as three B-sides from the album&#x27;s sessions: &quot;Here with Me&quot;, &quot;I Quit&quot;, and &quot;Alive&quot;. &quot;Nothing with You&quot; was released to radio the same day. &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; followed on March 23 and was released in both CD and LP formats, with a cover illustration drawn by Chris Shary depicting the band&#x27;s Milo character drawn on graph paper.

== Themes ==
The songs on &quot;Cool to Be You&quot; address topics including love and relationships, sociopolitical commentary, the death of parents, nerdiness, and flatulence. Merican&quot; addresses positive and negative aspects of American history, celebrating cultural figures such as Otis Redding, Duke Ellington, and Walt Whitman while condemning slavery, Joseph McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Vietnam War. Stevenson wrote &quot;One More Day&quot; about the death of his father, who he had taken in and cared for throughout the last year of his life: &quot;He and I always had a terrible relationship. We spent a good part of my adult life being somewhat estranged from each other. He became ill and I took care of him for a little while. And then he died. That song is just about his and my relationship. Just to get that out of me and not holding it inside anymore, is a huge relief for me [...] Every single time I hear that song, it just freaks me out. I&#x27;ve never, ever written a song that&#x27;s freaked me out that much.&quot;

== Reception ==
&quot;Cool to Be You&quot; became the fourth Descendents release to chart, reaching No. 143 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 6 amongst independent albums. Al Campbell of Allmusic rated it four stars out of five, commenting that &quot;Like the Ramones before them, the Descendents&#x27; overall sound tends to be interchangeable, in the best possible way, with previous efforts. Why mess with a good thing? For instance, among these 14 tracks, &#x27;Nothing with You&#x27; can be compared to &#x27;Clean Sheets,&#x27; while &#x27;Cool to Be You&#x27; and &#x27;Mass Nerder&#x27; are anthems à la &#x27;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&#x27; and &#x27;I Don&#x27;t Want to Grow Up. Aubin Paul of Punknews.org gave the album four and a half stars out of five, complimenting the band&#x27;s ability to work in more mature subject matter while still maintaining the childish and self-deprecating humor that &quot;is almost impossible to find anything but endearing and sympathetic.&quot; He particularly praised the band&#x27;s musical abilities and Stevenson&#x27;s production skills, saying that &quot;Musically, the band hasn&#x27;t changed drastically since 1982&#x27;s &quot;Milo Goes to College&quot;; they&#x27;re still focused on somewhat unorthodox melodies, anchored by an incredibly tight rhythm section and some guitar pyrotechnics. The band is clearly tighter and more comfortable with strong melodies, but with the exception of the omission of sub-30 second goof offs like &#x27;Coffee Mug&#x27; and &#x27;Weinerschnitzel&#x27;, there is little that will alienate old fans. The production, by way of Stevenson (who has been producing one excellent sounding record after another at his Blasting Room studio) is the best yet, with every instrument clear and not one dominating. The common description of &#x27;pop-hardcore&#x27; is still undisputed.&quot;

<text>Rupert Lee Blue (May 30, 1868 – April 12, 1948) was an American physician and soldier. He was the fourth Surgeon General of the United States from 1912 to 1920. He served as president of the American Medical Association in 1916–17.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Rupert Blue was born in Richmond County, North Carolina, and raised in Marion, South Carolina. He attended the University of Virginia (1889–1890) and earned his M.D. from the University of Maryland (1892). His first association with the Public Health Service (PHS), then known as the Marine Hospital Service (MHS), came through a nine-month internship (1 June 1892 to 2 March 1893), after which Blue applied for entrance into the MHS Regular Corps and was commissioned as an Assistant Surgeon on 3 March 1893.

===Career===
Blue spent his early years in the MHS at the front lines of turn-of-the-century public health, participating in the medical inspection of immigrants of the United States and battling outbreaks of epidemic disease. Then-Surgeon General Walter Wyman dispatched Blue twice to oversee rat eradication and urban sanitation programs after bubonic plague struck San Francisco, once in February 1903 during the San Francisco plague of 1900–1904, and again in August 1907 during a second series which followed the 1906 earthquake and fires.

During his initial deployment Blue acted as a middleman reporting back to Wyman concerning the political climate surrounding San Francisco. The majority of Blue&#x27;s work consisted of acting as a mediator between the various branches of government who at the time were conflicted on their opinions of whether or not the bubonic plague was actually present in San Francisco. Upon arriving Blue was able to organize a conference between the federal, state, civil and business leaders of the area to discuss the sanitation conditions in Chinatown, where the majority of plague cases were aggregated within the city.

Blue&#x27;s primary concern was to secure funding to improve the sanitation conditions of Chinatown through the implementation and maintenance of sanitation measures. These proposed measures consisted of vermin eradication, growing scientific evidence pointed to rats as carriers of the plague, and creating physical barriers between rats and humans through cementation of basement floors and walls.

This initial conference, organized by Blue, ended with the adaptation of a binding resolution that prioritized funding for sanitation campaigns throughout San Francisco until the city was declared plague free. This was the first time all levels of government had been able to put political differences aside and agree on a direction together. These conference meetings continued to occur on a biweekly notice, and eventually led to the creation of the Public Health Commission of California with Blue as its inaugural president in April 1903.

Funding for these sanitation campaigns lasted from 1903 through 1905 at which time San Francisco was declared plague free due to a decrease in mortality rate within Chinatown and the lack of any new cases reported to officials. The success of these sanitation programs were credited to Blue for his diplomacy skills among the different levels of government. With the implementation of these programs Blue was able to stem the plague and enable Wyman to avoid imposing a federal quarantine on the bay area.

In April 1905, with pressure from the municipal government of San Francisco and no new cases, Blue succeeded his position as head of the United States Public Health Service in San Francisco (after being appointed in May 1903) to Donald Currie before heading off to his next post.

When he wasn&#x27;t trapping rats and squirrels in California, Blue directed mosquito eradication efforts to control yellow fever in New Orleans (1905), at the Jamestown Exposition (1907), and in Honolulu (1911), to help Hawaii prepare for traffic to follow the opening of the new Panama Canal. In addition, he represented the United States on a number of sanitation projects in South America and attended the London School of Tropical Medicine (1910). Blue&#x27;s successes in the field made his reputation. He was promoted to the position of Surgeon (17 May 1909), and after Wyman died unexpectedly, President William Howard Taft nominated Blue to serve as Surgeon General (13 January 1912 through 3 March 1920). Blue would go on to serve a second four-year term under President Woodrow Wilson (1916–1920).

Surgeon General Blue the plague fighter became an institution builder as well. He inherited the Act of 1912, which reoriented PHS toward research and public campaigns against disease. Passage of the Act of 1912 capped 6 years of lively debate about how to strengthen Federal public health efforts more generally. It designated the U.S. Treasury Department’s Marine Hospital and Public Health Service, rather than the Department of the Interior, as the lead Federal agency (and shortened the name to PHS), responsible not only for interstate quarantine and health services delivery to Federal wards but also for the health of the general public. The Act stepped up Federal public health activities, most notably in response to repeated outbreaks of typhoid fever that tore through cities and towns that drew drinking water from increasingly contaminated supplies. The Act of 1912 authorized Hygienic Laboratory investigations into water pollution&#x27;s contribution to the disease burden, including a new field research station at Cincinnati, Ohio. Interstate guidelines were developed and put into effect to ensure potable water and pasteurized milk. PHS received authority to initiate field research independently of county and state health departments and to extend campaigns against infectious disease toward the control of occupational and environmental threats. During 1914 PHS opened an Office of Industrial Hygiene and Sanitation at the Marine Hospital in Pittsburgh, near the Department of the Interior’s new Bureau of Mines.

Under Blue&#x27;s leadership, physician researchers at PHS turned the new science of bacteriology and the age-old practices of sanitation and public education to effective use against diseases linked to poverty in both rural and urban areas.

* Dr. George McCoy documented tularemia’s bacterial origins.
* Dr. Charles Stiles charted the extent of hookworm disease, and its positive correlation with insanitary soil conditions, throughout the Southeast.
* Dr. Joseph Goldberger used field studies at Spartanburg, South Carolina and at the Greenfield prison farm to uncover the nutritional deficiencies at the root of pellagra (1914–1915).
* Dr. Leslie Lumsden reduced the prevalence of typhoid fever through rural privy-building campaigns and spurred the establishment of the first full-time county health department, at Yakima, Washington (1911).
* Dr. John McMullan brought his knowledge of trachoma treatment and prevention from work with immigrants to public health campaigns among American Indians and rural populations in the Ozarks and Southern Appalachian mountains, setting up the first of his temporary hospitals at Hindman, Kentucky (1913).

===World War I===

After the United States officially entered World War I on 3 April 1917, Blue oversaw a dramatic short-term expansion of PHS duties without the benefit of increased appropriations. The military draft underway by July 1917 meant the movement of hundreds of thousands of draftees to temporary encampments around the country, with few provisions for public health by the War Department or state health departments. In response, PHS established venereal disease control programs with funding from the Red Cross, provided industrial hygiene and health services for the thousands of workers laboring in war plants and the communities surrounding them, emptied swamps and sprayed for mosquitoes to prevent malaria, and built sanitary privies. Back in Washington, D.C., the Hygienic Laboratory produced vaccines against tetanus, diphtheria, typhoid, and smallpox. Blue&#x27;s public health infrastructure was up and running by the time that Congressional support came, in the form of earmarked dollars and a statute covering the control and prevention of venereal disease (the Chamberlain Act of 1918). 

During World War I, under SG Rupert Blue, cigarettes were issued as part of each fighting man&#x27;s basic field rations kit.

Recruiting and retaining physicians during wartime was a challenge to PHS, a situation made worse by the global Spanish influenza pandemic that reached the United States in September 1918. Blue had applauded President Wilson&#x27;s Executive Order making PHS an arm of the military (issued in April 1917 and repealed in 1921), and subsequent moves to set officers’ pay and benefits on a par with those of the armed forces, but did not see passage of legislation creating a PHS Reserve Corps until October 1918, well into the flu pandemic. Pressure to add staff also came from Congress&#x27; mandate (1917) that PHS provide health services for disabled and, as of March 1919, all World War One veterans, through a new Bureau of War Risk Insurance in the Treasury Department. Over the following year, PHS assembled a network of fourteen district offices and transformed war surplus facilities into hospitals and clinics, scrambling for staff and resources to stretch the $10.5 million given by Congress to fund the new program. 

Given his tenure during this period, it may not come as a surprise that Blue advocated enacting national health insurance, then known as universal sickness insurance, as part of an overall Federal public health strategy. Blue spoke not only as Surgeon General and on behalf of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers but also as President of the American Medical Association (1916–17).

A change in leadership at the Department of the Treasury, PHS&#x27; home, may have led to Blue&#x27;s decision to step down from his posting as Surgeon General on 9 March 1920. He resumed the rank of Assistant Surgeon General and was assigned to Paris, France, to oversee PHS operations in Europe and to serve as U.S. delegate to the Office International d’Hygiene Public (1920–1923) and subsequently to the League of Nations. 

After a full career at PHS, Blue retired from PHS on 1 December 1932. He was advanced to the rank of Vice Admiral in 1942. He died on 12 April 1948, in Charleston, South Carolina.

<text>Barnett Abba Slepian (April 23, 1946 – October 23, 1998) was an American physician and abortion provider who was assassinated in his home by James Charles Kopp, a militant member of the US anti-abortion movement.

==Life and career==
Slepian was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and raised in Rochester, New York; his grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Russia. Slepian graduated from the University of Denver with a zoology degree. He then graduated from Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara medical school in 1978.

Slepian worked at Buffalo Women Services in Buffalo, New York, providing abortion for members of the local and surrounding communities. He also ran his own private OB-GYN practice in Amherst, New York, where he also resided.

On October 23, 1998, Slepian had returned from synagogue, where he was attending a memorial service for his father, and was preparing soup in his kitchen when he was struck by a bullet fired through his window. The bullet shattered his spine and tore his aorta, barely missing his son&#x27;s head as it exited. He died two hours later. Earlier that afternoon, Slepian&#x27;s wife Lynne had forwarded a warning of potential attacks on her husband to a local police inspector.

Within days of Slepian&#x27;s murder, anti-abortion groups rallied and staged clinic protests in Buffalo and Rochester, New York. While local leaders from both sides of the abortion debate decried these rallies as potential incitements to further violence, more extreme opponents of reproductive rights, such as Flip Benham of Operation Rescue, labeled calls for nonviolence &quot;pitiful&quot; and suggested that unless abortion was outlawed, &quot;we are in store for more bloodshed in the streets—the likes of which will sicken even the sturdiest among us.&quot; This murder was the climax of a series of five sniper attacks in four years in northern New York and Canada. Slepian was the third doctor and up to that time the seventh person in the United States to be murdered for performing abortions.

Following Slepian&#x27;s murder, Kopp fled the U.S., being placed on the FBI Top Ten Most Wanted list, but was arrested in France in 2001 and extradited. He was tried and convicted of second degree murder in Buffalo and is currently serving a 25 years to life term of imprisonment. Kopp was also convicted of federal charges and sentenced to life in prison without parole.

The Ani DiFranco song &quot;Hello Birmingham&quot;, from her 1999 album &quot;To The Teeth&quot;, was written as a response to the Slepian murder.

<text>Francis Eugene Beecher (September 29, 1921 – February 24, 2014) was the lead guitarist for Bill Haley &amp; His Comets from 1954 to 1962, and is best remembered for his innovative guitar solos that incorporated elements of jazz. He composed the classics &quot;Blue Comet Blues&quot;, &quot;Goofin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Week End&quot;, &quot;The Catwalk&quot;, and &quot;Shaky&quot; when he was the lead guitarist for Bill Haley and the Comets. He continued to perform with surviving members of the Comets into 2006. In 2012, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Beecher as a member of the Comets by a special committee, aimed at correcting the previous mistake of not inducting the Comets with Bill Haley.

==Career==

By the time Beecher became associated with Bill Haley, he had already had a lengthy career as a guitarist, having performed and recorded with the Benny Goodman Orchestra, which he joined in 1948, at a time Goodman was experimenting with music in the bebop idiom. He also worked with other big bands, with singer and former Goodman &quot;bop band&quot; pianist Buddy Greco and the Sharps, as well as with several country western groups. He played guitar on the 1947 single by Buddy Greco &quot;Baby I&#x27;m True to You&quot; backed with &quot;How Many Times&quot;, released as Musicraft 569, and the 1948 single &quot;Lillette&quot; backed with &quot;A Stranger in Town&quot;, as Musicraft 588. His guitar work influenced young musicians playing the same venues in the Philadelphia/Reading area where the Comets were based, among them the guitarist and future legendary comic-book writer-artist Jim Steranko.

Beecher first worked with the Comets in fall 1954 as a session musician, replacing the recently deceased guitarist Danny Cedrone. Beecher&#x27;s first work with Haley was the single &quot;Dim, Dim the Lights&quot;. Beecher had to be instructed to make his guitar solos less jazzy. &quot;They wanted to play a more basic style than I was used to, more country really, they called it rockabilly.&quot;

At the time Beecher began working for Haley&#x27;s group, Haley did not employ a full-time lead guitarist who would also play on live shows and TV appearances (such duties were usually handled by Haley himself or steel guitarist Billy Williamson). In August 1955, Beecher appeared for the first time on national TV with the Comets performing &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, and soon afterward was promoted to a full-time member of the band, appearing with the group in the films &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1956) and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; (1956), as well as several other film appearances: in Germany in 1958, &quot;Hier bin ich - hier bleib&#x27; ich&quot; &quot;(Here I Am, Here I Stay)&quot; (1959) and in Mexico in the early 1960s, such as &quot;Jóvenes y rebeldes&quot; (1961) and &quot;Besito a Papa&quot; (1961).

Beecher had the ability to send his voice into a high pitch (making it sound like that of a small child). This gimmick was used for the opening of the hit Haley single&#x27;s &quot;See You Later Alligator&quot;, &quot;(You Hit the Wrong Note) Billy Goat&quot; and &quot;Rip It Up&quot;. According to Swenson, Beecher would also occasionally perform the voice during live shows, with Haley or Williamson humorously introducing him as a baritone. In 1959, Williamson and Beecher recorded a duet, &quot;ABC Rock&quot;, in which Beecher sang two entire verses in his little-kid voice.
In 1958, Beecher and the other Comets recorded under the name The Kingsmen, releasing several 45 singles for East West Records. The single &quot;Week End&quot;, released as East West 115 and backed with &quot;Better Believe It&quot;, reached number 35 on the Billboard pop singles chart in November 1958. The follow-up single was &quot;The Cat Walk&quot; backed by &quot;Conga Rock&quot;, released as East West 120.

Beecher left the Comets in 1960 in order to work with a spin-off group called the Merri-Men which released a 45 single on Apt Records, &quot;Big Daddy&quot;/&quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;; he returned to the group in 1961 only to leave again in 1962. A few months later, he agreed to sit in with the band for a live album recording session for Roulette Records (the album was entitled &quot;Twisting Knights at the Roundtable&quot;). After Haley&#x27;s death in 1981, Beecher toured with a short-lived Comets reunion group. Finally, starting in 1987, the surviving members of the 1954-55 Comets reunited and proceeded to tour the world and make new recordings for the next two decades. Beecher performed with this group until July 2006, after which the group announced he had retired; although it was announced that the 85-year-old guitarist would tour Europe with the Comets in early 2007, this did not occur. 

Franny Beecher&#x27;s compositions included &quot;Blue Comet Blues&quot;, &quot;Goofin&#x27; Around&quot;, &quot;Shaky&quot;, &quot;Tampico Twist&quot;, &quot;The Beak Speaks&quot;, &quot;Hot to Trot&quot;, &quot;Beecher Boogie Woogie&quot;, &quot;Whistlin&#x27; and Walkin&#x27; Twist&quot;, &quot;The Catwalk&quot;, and &quot;Week End&quot;, which was a chart hit with The Kingsmen, reaching no.35, co-written with Rudy Pompilli and Billy Williamson. &quot;Week End&quot; was recorded and released as a single by rock guitarist Link Wray in September, 1963 as Swan S-4154. Sid Phillips and His Band released &quot;Week End&quot; as a 45 single in the UK in 1958 on His Master&#x27;s Voice. Red Price released &quot;Week End&quot; as a single in the UK on Pye Records in 1958.

With the Comets, Franny Beecher played a black 1956 Gibson Les Paul Custom which was given to him by the Gibson Guitar Company, then based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Gibson also gave Bill Haley a blonde 1956 Super 400 and a black 1956 Gibson L-7. The Les Paul Custom featured a pair of black single coil P-90 pickups, one of which was a bar magnet P-90. Earlier, he had played a Gibson L-5 acoustic with a cutaway body and a DeArmond pickup, as noted in &quot;Sound and Glory&quot;, page 100. He played an Epiphone Emperor when he was a member of the Benny Goodman band in 1948 and 1949, which he also played on the Ed Sullivan Show during a performance of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. In the Mexican film &quot;Juventide y rebeldes&quot; (1961), he is playing either a Gibson ES-345 or ES-355 Stereo. His other guitars included a blonde 1959 ES-350T, which in his later years he no longer owned. He played a cherry sunburst Gibson ES-137 Classic in concerts and while touring.

<text>Hugh Smith Cumming (August 17, 1869 – December 20, 1948) was an U.S. physician and soldier. He served as the fifth Surgeon General of the United States from 1920 to 1936.

A collection of his papers are held at the National Library of Medicine.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cumming was born in Hampton, Virginia. He received his undergraduate education at Baltimore City College and then obtained medical degrees from the University of Virginia School of Medicine in 1893, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity, and the University College of Medicine (in Richmond, Virginia) in 1894 (the latter while serving as house doctor at St. Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Richmond). In 1894, he obtained a commission as an Assistant Surgeon in the Marine Hospital Service, which was to become the Public Health Service and Marine Hospital Service in 1902 and then the Public Health Service in 1912.

===Career===
Cumming was assigned to a variety of posts during his early career in the Service, especially quarantine stations in the South and on the West Coast of the United States. He also served on immigration duty at Ellis Island, New York. For 3 years, from February 1906 to February 1909, Cumming was detailed to the office of the United States Consul General in Yokohama, Japan, where he was concerned with immigration and quarantinable diseases. From 1913 to 1919, he was assigned to the Hygienic Laboratory (forerunner of the National Institutes of Health) in Washington, DC. There he was placed in charge of an investigation of the pollution of tidal waters of Maryland and Virginia. One of his concerns was the shellfish industry, and the potential threat to human health from consuming oysters grown in waters polluted with sewage.

During World War I, Cumming was assigned to the United States Navy as a sanitary advisor. He was later ordered to Europe to study the sanitary conditions of the ports from which troops would embark and to confer with military authorities to take the necessary action to prevent the introduction of disease into the United States by returning troops. He was also a member of the Typhus Fever Commission to Poland.

==== Surgeon General ====
On 3 March 1920, Cumming was appointed Surgeon General of the United States Public Health Service. The Public Health Service (PHS) had been given the task in 1919 of providing health care for veterans, and the Service was still expanding and adjusting to this new responsibility when Cumming took office. In 1922, however, Congress created the Veterans&#x27; Bureau, and the responsibility for the health care of veterans was transferred from the PHS to the new Bureau. Another event of Cumming&#x27;s early tenure was the creation of a national leprosy hospital in Carville, Louisiana in 1921 when the PHS took control of what had been the Louisiana Leper Home. The facility at Carville became a major center for leprosy treatment and research.

Soon after his appointment, Cumming inaugurated a plan for the medical inspection of immigrants abroad in the principal countries of origin. This plan reduced the number of immigrants who were turned back for medical reasons after making the trip to the United States. In the 1920s, the PHS also completed the development of a national maritime quarantine system by acquiring the last two quarantine stations operated by States.

The Narcotic Farms Act of 1929 authorized the PHS to establish a Division of Narcotics (the name was later changed to Division of Mental Hygiene) and to construct two hospitals for the treatment of drug addicts. Cumming also expanded the research activities of the Hygienic Laboratory, which in 1930 became the National Institute of Health. Under Cumming, the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps was also authorized to admit dentists, pharmacists, and sanitary engineers, the first expansion of the Regular Corps beyond physicians.

In 1930, the PHS was given the responsibility of providing medical and psychiatric care to Federal prisoners. Under the Social Security Act of 1935, the PHS was authorized to provide grants-in-aid to the States for the development of public health work.

Cumming served as President of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States in 1924 and as President of the American Public Health Association in 1931. In 1931 Cumming initiated &quot;The Tuskegee study of untreated syphilis in the negro male&quot;—begun in 1932, continued under Cumming&#x27;s successors, ended in 1972. Cumming was also on the Advisory Board of the Eugenics Committee of the USA (ECUSA).

In 1935 Cumming was awarded the Public Welfare Medal from the National Academy of Sciences.

==== International Office of Public Hygiene ====
While he was Surgeon General, Cumming attended several meetings of the International Office of Public Health (OIHP) in Paris, the predecessor of the World Health Organization.

After ending his term as Surgeon-General, Cumming served for a period as Chairman of the Permanent Committee of the OIHP.

===Personal life===
Hugh Cumming retired as Surgeon General and from active duty in the Public Health Service on 31 January 1936 as a rear admiral. He continued to serve as Director of the Pan American Sanitary Bur eau until 1947. He died in Washington, DC, on 20 December 1948.

His son, Hugh S. Cumming Jr., was a career Foreign Service Officer who served as United States Ambassador to Indonesia.

<doc id="1097144" wikidata="Q574585" url="?curid=1097144" title="Johnny Grande">
<text>John Andrew Grande (January 14, 1930 – June 3, 2006) was a member of Bill Haley&#x27;s backing band, The Comets.

==Life and career==
Born in South Philadelphia, Grande played piano and accordion with Bill Haley and the Saddlemen, later known as Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, from 1949 to 1962-63. One of his jobs was to keep track of musical arrangements for the group as he was one of the few members who could read sheet music.

Grande and steel guitarist Billy Williamson were both members of the country band, Southern Swingsters before convincing Bill Haley to start a new group, the Saddlemen in 1949.

Grande was one of the original business partners who formed the Saddlemen (the other partners being Bill Haley himself (d. 1981) and steel guitarist Billy Williamson (d. 1995)). During the Labor Day weekend of 1952, the Saddlemen, realizing that their musical style was moving away from country and western decided to change their name to The Comets.

Although primarily a piano player, Grande performed on accordion during most live shows as it was easier to transport than a piano, plus the hand-held instrument allowed him to participate more directly in the band&#x27;s acrobatic instrumentals, such as &quot;Rudy&#x27;s Rock&quot;.

Grande was one of the musicians involved in the classic 1954 recording of &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. He also appeared with the band in most of their motion picture appearances, including &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot;. He left the group in either late 1962 or early 1963 (accounts differ), following a tour of Germany.

In 1987, he reunited with several other members of the 1954-55 Comets and he continued to tour the world, perform and record with the group for the next twenty years.

==Death==
In the spring of 2006 the onset of ill health forced Grande to temporarily take a hiatus from the Comets, who at the time were engaged in a long-term gig at Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand Theater in Branson, Missouri. He died in his sleep in Clarksville, Tennessee of cancer-related causes a few weeks later, on June 3, 2006.

==Legacy==
In 2012, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Comets by a special committee aimed at correcting the mistake of not inducting the group with Bill Haley in 1987.

==Compositions==
His compositions included &quot;Birth Of The Boogie&quot;, &quot;A Rockin&#x27; Little Tune&quot;, &quot;Goofin&#x27; Around&quot; with Franny Beecher, &quot;Lean Jean&quot;, &quot;Better Believe It&quot;, &quot;China Twist&quot;, &quot;Happy Twist&quot;, &quot;Twist del Dia&quot;, &quot;Tampico Twist&quot;, and &quot;Two Shadows&quot;.

<text>William Famous Williamson (February 9, 1925 – March 22, 1996) was the American steel guitar player for Bill Haley and His Saddlemen, and its successor group Bill Haley &amp; His Comets, from 1949 to 1963.

==Life and career==
A founding member of both the Saddlemen and the Comets, Williamson often acted as the band&#x27;s emcee and comic relief during live concerts; he also played lead guitar on occasion. He was with the band when they recorded &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; in 1954 and appeared with the band when they performed the song on the Milton Berle Show and the Ed Sullivan Show in 1955. Williamson had the distinction of being the only Comet allowed to record lead vocal tracks during Haley&#x27;s tenure at Decca Records (such as the song &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; on their 1956 album, &quot;Rock and Roll Stage Show&quot; and &quot;B.B. Betty&quot; on the 1958 &quot;Bill Haley&#x27;s Chicks&quot; album. He also shared a number of songwriting credits with Haley. His wife, Catherine Cafra, was also credited as co-writer of a number of songs recorded by Haley, including the 1958 hit, &quot;Skinny Minnie.&quot;

He appeared in the rock and roll movies &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Knock the Rock&quot; in 1956, &quot;Hier bin ich - hier bleib&#x27; ich&quot; (Here I Am, Here I Stay) in 1959, and &quot;Jóvenes y rebeldes&quot; and &quot;Besito a Papa&quot; in 1961.

Williamson left the Comets in early 1963 and reportedly never played another note, declining invitations to join Comets&#x27; reunion groups that formed after Haley&#x27;s death in 1981. He died at the age of 71 in 1996.

In 2012, Williamson was inducted as a member of the Comets into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by a special committee, aimed to correct the previous mistake of not inducting the band with Bill Haley in 1987.

==Compositions==
In 1958, he co-wrote the hit &quot;Week End&quot; with Franny Beecher and Rudy Pompilli, which reached no.35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart when released as a single on East West Records by The Kingsmen, a group made up of The Comets, as East West 115. He co-wrote the follow-up single as well, &quot;The Catwalk&quot;, with Franny Beecher, also released on East West as East West 120. His other compositions included &quot;Shaky&quot;, &quot;Two Shadows&quot;, &quot;Birth Of The Boogie&quot;, &quot;Pat-a-Cake&quot;, &quot;A Rockin&#x27; Little Tune&quot;, &quot;The Beak Speaks&quot;, &quot;Whistlin&#x27; and Walkin&#x27; Twist&quot;, &quot;Happy Twist&quot;, &quot;Tacos de Twist&quot;, &quot;Hot to Trot&quot;, and &quot;Caroline&#x27;s Pony&quot;. He co-wrote the song &quot;Teenage Love Affair&quot; for the Cook Brothers, who released it as a single on Arcade Records in 1960. He co-wrote the songs &quot;Wee Willie Brown&quot; and &quot;You Were Mean Baby&quot; for Lou Graham which were released as a Coral single in 1958.

<text>The Flash and Circle is a fascist symbol used by several organisations. It was first used by the British Union of Fascists (BUF), and was adopted in 1935.

==Origins within the BUF (1935–1940) ==
The BUF was founded in 1932 and adopted the fasces as its emblem, whose bundle of sticks represents strength through unity, and whose axe represents the supreme authority of the state to which citizens owe allegiance. Although the fasces was utilized almost exclusively by Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Blackshirts, the BUF claimed that they had a right to use the symbol on the basis that the fasces was used extensively in Britain during Roman times, and that the British Empire continued to carry on the tradition of civilisation from them. The symbol would officially be changed in March 1934 from the plain gold fasces to a Union Flag within a shield and a fasces placed on top. The reasons for this change was that the BUF wanted to emphasise its commitment to king and country through the addition of the national emblem, the other reason was to help the movement distinguish itself in foreign nations.
Starting in the 1930s, the fasces began to be phased out in favour of the BUF&#x27;s final symbol, the Flash and Circle. In the summer of 1935, Eric H. Piercy, the commander of the Fascist Defence Force, designed the emblem and presented it to Oswald Mosley, the BUF&#x27;s leader. The official colors were: a white lightning bolt (&quot;flash&quot;) and circle, a blue roundel, and a red background. The symbolism of this design was meant to convey a flash of action within a circle of unity. While there was a lack of consistency in the appearance of the Flash and Circle, such as the short-lived inverted version used in 1935, it would go on to become the main symbol of the party and was used extensively throughout 1935-1940. The BUF&#x27;s left-wing opponents nicknamed the symbol the &quot;&quot;. The usage of any symbols by the BUF would slowly decline after the party was banned and its leadership (including Mosley) was interned on 23 May 1940 under Defence Regulation 18B.

==Post-war usage (1948 onwards)==
After being released from internment, Mosley would continue his political activities, creating the Union Movement (UM) in February 1948. The UM would go on to adopt the Flash and Circle as its symbol. Throughout the 50s and 60s multiple branch flags were adopted using a black background with a yellow Flash and Circle with the name of the branch underneath in yellow as well. Another variant was adopted by the Mosley Youth in the early 50s. This design consisted of a red background with a black circle and a white flash.

==Usage outside of the BUF==
The emblem of the Bulgarian fascist party, Union of Bulgarian National Legions (SBNL) utilised a variant of the version of flash and circle, replacing the swastika. The lightning bolt represented the SBNL striking at communism. Eventually the emblem would replace the lightning bolt with the swastika towards the end of 1944. The insignia of the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) of Singapore is composed of a red flash struck through a smaller blue circle on a white background. The PAP insignia is claimed to represent &quot;action within social/racial unity&quot; with the white background representing purity in thought and deed. When asked about the origins of the insignia, Lee Kuan Yew—a founding member of the PAP and Singapore&#x27;s first Prime Minister—&quot;acknowledged a design influence from the BUF symbol but added that the colour scheme had been changed for the PAP logo.&quot;.

==Similar non-political symbols==
The simple combination of the lightning bolt and circle has given rise to many similar designs unrelated to the fascist flash and circle. These include the logo of BoltBus, which chose the design before the similarity was ever noticed. The Tampa Bay Lightning hockey team use a somewhat similar design on their primary and alternate logos. One form of warning sign for high-voltage electricity uses a lightning bolt inside a circle, and this was repurposed by Marilyn Manson as an insignia for his album &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;. German automobile manufacturer Opel uses a horizontal lightning bolt and circle in black and white as its logo. In most cases, there is no evidence to suggest that the designer intended to evoke an association with political use of the symbol.

<text>Wing Records was a record label subsidiary of Mercury Records founded in 1955, that found its greatest success during the late 1950s.

In 1986, the label was revived by Mercury&#x27;s parent company, PolyGram and the label had brief success with R&amp;B singers Vanessa Williams, Lace, Tony! Toni! Toné!, Channel 2, and Brian McKnight. McKnight was signed to Wing in 1989, but the album he recorded (his 1992 self-titled debut) was not released on the label. Instead, it was issued on Mercury. Jerry Murad&#x27;s Harmonicats were on Wing soon after quitting Vitacoustic Records in 1948.

In 1996, Wing closed and its remaining artists (Vanessa Williams &amp; Tony! Toni! Toné!) were moved to Mercury.
