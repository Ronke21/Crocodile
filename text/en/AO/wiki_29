<text>Strange Little Girls is a concept album released by singer-songwriter Tori Amos in 2001. The album&#x27;s 12 tracks are covers of songs written and originally performed by men, reinterpreted by Amos from a female point of view. Amos created female personae for each track (one song featured twins) and was photographed as each, with makeup done by Kevyn Aucoin. In the United States the album was issued with four alternative covers depicting Amos as the characters singing &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot;, &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, and &quot;Raining Blood&quot;. A fifth cover of the &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like Mondays&quot; character was also issued in the UK and other territories. Text accompanying the photos and songs was written by author Neil Gaiman. The complete short stories in which this text appears can be found in Gaiman&#x27;s 2006 collection &quot;Fragile Things&quot;.

As with Amos&#x27;s previous two studio albums, the cover album was recorded at her Cornwall studio. The album received mixed reviews upon its release in September 2001 with critics largely seeing the album as a mixed bag, praising the unlikely re-workings of Eminem&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot; and Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Raining Blood&quot;, while panning the versions of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. Amos also tackled songs by artists such as Tom Waits, the Velvet Underground, Depeche Mode, and the Stranglers.

The album&#x27;s greatest attention was garnered from Amos&#x27;s cover of Eminem&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;97 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, a rap song. The album&#x27;s cover of &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot; was translated into a discussion on the right to bear arms, and included soundbites from both George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, as well as from Amos&#x27;s own minister father. The album entered the charts at US No. 4, selling 111,000 copies, making it her third album to debut in the US Top 10, her second-highest debut in terms of sales, and her best position in the US for almost six years.

The song was featured in Season 4 of &quot;The West Wing&quot; in the episode &quot;20 Hours in America Part 2&quot;.

A planned commercial EP &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot; (originally by the Stranglers), including &quot;After All&quot; (originally by David Bowie) and &quot;Only Women Bleed&quot; (originally by Alice Cooper), was pulled from shelves soon after being shipped to stores in Europe. Despite being recalled from the shelves, limited copies of the single were sold and a promotional video was made.

Additionally, Amos later acknowledged that she had attempted to reinterpret four other songs that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t find her way into.&quot; They were &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; by Public Enemy, &quot;Hoover Factory&quot; by Elvis Costello, &quot;I&#x27;m Sick of You&quot; by Iggy Pop and &quot;Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s Favorite Poem&quot; by Peter Murphy. These tracks have not been released. She also mentioned later in a 2012 interview that, with drummer Matt Chamberlain, she had recorded &quot;Growin&#x27; Up&quot; by Bruce Springsteen for this album, but it has also not been released although she has played it live.

Amos received two 2002 Grammy nominations: Female Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Strange Little Girl&quot;, and Alternative Music Performance for the album.

<doc id="88727" wikidata="Q1130661" url="?curid=88727" title="Lofn">
<text>In Norse mythology, Lofn (Old Norse: , possibly &quot;comforter,&quot; &quot;the comforter, the mild,&quot; or &quot;loving&quot;) is a goddess. Lofn is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, Lofn is described as gentle in manner and as an arranger of marriages, even when they have been forbidden. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.

==Attestations==
In chapter 35 of the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, High provides brief descriptions of 16 ásynjur. High lists Lofn eighth and about her says that:

:&#x27;She is so gentle and so good to invoke that she has permission from All-Father or Frigg to arrange unions between men and women, even if earlier offers have been received and unions have been banned. From her name comes the word &quot;lof&quot;, meaning permission as well as high praise.&#x27;

In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Lofn is included among a list of 27 ásynjur names. Elsewhere in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Lofn appears in a kenning for &quot;woman&quot; in a work by the skald Ormr Steinþórsson. Otherwise Lofn appears frequently as a base word in skaldic kennings for &quot;woman.&quot;

==Theories==
John Lindow says that scholars have generally followed Snorri&#x27;s etymological connection with the root &quot;lof-&quot;, meaning &quot;praise.&quot; Lindow says that, along with many other goddesses, some scholars theorize that Lofn may simply be another name for the goddess Frigg. Rudolf Simek theorizes that Snorri used skaldic kennings to produce his &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; commentary about the goddess, while combining several etymologies with the Old Norse personal name &quot;Lofn&quot;.

<doc id="88728" wikidata="Q896069" url="?curid=88728" title="Boys for Pele">
<text>Boys for Pele is the third studio album by American singer and songwriter Tori Amos. Preceded by the first single, &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, by three weeks, the album was released on January 22, 1996, in the United Kingdom, on January 23 in the United States, and on January 29 in Australia. Despite the album being Amos&#x27;s least radio friendly material to date, &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; debuted at number two on both the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the UK Albums Chart, making it her biggest simultaneous transatlantic debut, her first &quot;Billboard&quot; top 10 debut, and the highest-charting US debut of her career to date.

&quot;Boys for Pele&quot; was recorded in rural Ireland and Louisiana and features 18 songs that incorporate harpsichord, clavichord, harmonium, gospel choirs, brass bands and full orchestras. Amos wrote all of the tracks, and for the first time, she served as sole producer for her own album. For Amos, the album was a step into a different direction, in terms of singing, songwriting, and recording, and is experimental in comparison to her previous work.

==Background==
During the recording of her previous album, &quot;Under the Pink&quot; (1994), Amos&#x27;s longtime professional and romantic relationship with Eric Rosse, who co-produced a considerable amount of her pre-&quot;Pele&quot; work, disintegrated. That loss, combined with a few subsequent encounters with men during the &quot;Under the Pink&quot; promotional tour, forced Amos to re-evaluate her relationship with men and masculinity. Amos explained, &quot;In my relationships with men, I was always musician enough, but not woman enough, I always met men in my life as a musician, and there would be magic, adoration. But then it would wear off. All of us want to be adored, even for five minutes a day, and nothing these men gave me was ever enough.&quot;

Songs began appearing in fragments, often while on stage during the &quot;Under the Pink&quot; tour. After a trip to Hawaii during which Amos learned about legendary volcano goddess Pele, the album began taking shape; Amos conceived of the songs as representing stealing fire from the men in her life as well as a journey to finding her own fire as a woman. From there, Amos explained, the songs just came. &quot;Sometimes the fury of it would make me step back, I began to live these songs as we separated. The vampire in me came out. You&#x27;re an emotional vampire, with blood in the corner of your mouth, and you put on matching lipstick so no one knows.&quot;

During this time, Amos, who has openly discussed her experiences with psychedelic drugs, particularly in relation to &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, did ceremonies with a South American shaman and experienced meeting the devil, leading her to write the track &quot;Father Lucifer.&quot;

The album would ultimately consist of 15 full-length songs and four short &quot;interludes&quot;. As Amos was finding &quot;parts and pieces of myself that I had never claimed&quot; on this journey, the 14 primary songs represent the number of body parts of the Egyptian god Osiris that his wife, the goddess Isis, had to find to put his body back together in Egyptian mythology. The arrangement of the songs on the album reflects the progression Amos intended to achieve on the double vinyl LP of the album; each of the four sides of the album on vinyl would open with an interlude track that leads into the rest of the three or four songs on each side. The vinyl release is the only version of the album in which the interludes (&quot;Beauty Queen&quot;, &quot;Mr. Zebra&quot;, &quot;Way Down&quot;, and &quot;Agent Orange&quot;) are not numbered.

==Production==
&quot;Boys for Pele&quot; is Amos&#x27;s first self-produced album; she would continue producing her own albums ever since. Given that the album deals with the role of women in religion and relationships, and particularly in light of her breakup with Rosse, who had served as producer for her previous two albums, Amos felt that it was appropriate to take complete control over producing &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, as a &quot;bid for independence&quot;. Of producing the album herself, Amos said, &quot;I was at the point I could not answer to anybody. I&#x27;d been answering my whole life to some patriarchal figure.&quot;

===Theme and lyrical content===
Two underlying currents run through &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;: exploring the role of women in both patriarchal religion and relationships. Amos had previously written songs in a religious and/or theological context (&quot;Crucify&quot; from &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; (1992), &quot;God&quot; from &quot;Under the Pink&quot;), but her viewpoint takes a particularly feminist slant on this album. &quot;The feminine part of God has been circumcised out of all religions ... God (is) a patriarchal force, a very masculine energy, with the feminine having been subservient, either being the mother, the lover, the virgin, but never the equal, never to have the whole.&quot; &quot;Muhammad My Friend&quot;, the eighth track on the album, best represents this aspect of the album&#x27;s theme with the line, &quot;It&#x27;s time to tell the world/We both know it was a girl back in Bethlehem.&quot;

Amos derived the album&#x27;s title from the Hawaiian volcano goddess, Pele, with the &quot;boys&quot; representing the men in her life. &quot;First I wanted to sacrifice all these guys to the volcano goddess and roast them like marshmallows, then I decided they gave me a really wonderful gift,&quot; Amos said of the title. Amos herself has described the album as a novel, as a &quot;story of the descent of a woman to gain her passion and gain her compassion,&quot; chronicling a woman&#x27;s self-discovery in a male-dominated world, looking for fragments of herself and being suppressed. Songs such as &quot;Blood Roses&quot;, &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, &quot;Hey Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Doughnut Song&quot; and &quot;Putting the Damage On&quot; deal directly with the aftermath of a break-up and a woman&#x27;s reflection on the failed relationship.

&quot;Blood Roses&quot;, which Amos had initially intended to serve as the opening track to the album, finds the singer scorned over a failed relationship, belting out lines such as, &quot;can&#x27;t forget the things you never said&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve shaved every place where you&#x27;ve been boy&quot;. Regarding &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, Amos says, &quot;the whole current is doing anything so that you don&#x27;t have to face yourself. Nothing is enough&quot;; her previous relationships with men being the song&#x27;s backbone with lines like, &quot;boys on my left side, boys on my right side, boys in the middle and you&#x27;re not here, I need a big loan from the girl zone.&quot;

===Recording===
Amos had initially planned to record the entire album in the American South because &quot;there&#x27;s a hiddenness about the South, and I wanted to go back there because it was similar to how I felt in my relationships with men,&quot; but the bulk of the record was recorded in a church in Delgany, County Wicklow, Ireland, as well as in New Orleans, Louisiana. Given her religious upbringing, Amos was drawn to record in a church, not in anger, but &quot;with the intention of wholeness and of bringing a fragmented woman back to freedom.&quot;
Amos chose to record the album in a church because it was about searching for an energy current,
about claiming the passionate aspect of womanhood that the church teaches is wrong, &quot;the idea of speaking my truth, no censorship, in a place that did not honor anyone&#x27;s truth unless it was the church&#x27;s truth,&quot; &quot;so I figured if I was going to claim my womanhood, my passion, and sing this record – which, for me, was claiming fragments that I had suppressed for a long time – then I was going to go back to a church, back to the old world, to do it.&quot;

Amos&#x27;s sound engineer came up with the idea of enclosing Amos by herself in a sound-deadening box, so that her normal body movement would not be caught by the microphones surrounding the piano and harpsichord. Only her arms protruded from the box. This technique allowed for more spaciousness in the sound, more of the room acoustics.

==B-sides==

The writing process and recording session for &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; is one of Amos&#x27;s most prolific. Between the songs that were included on the album, included as B-sides, and included in later compilations, Amos composed and recorded approximately 35 songs during this time.

The chart displayed here lists only the songs that were released as B-sides on singles from &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;.

Many songs written and recorded for &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; were released in conjunction with subsequent albums or have yet to be released. Three such songs, &quot;Cooling&quot;, &quot;Never Seen Blue&quot; and &quot;Beulah Land&quot;, were recorded for inclusion on &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;, but were kept off the album, later released as B-sides on the &quot;Spark&quot; (1998) and &quot;Jackie&#x27;s Strength&quot; (1998) singles.

Other songs were partially written during the &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; era and finished and released later: &quot;Snow Cherries from France&quot; appears on the &quot;Tales of a Librarian&quot; (2003) compilation, her final release with Atlantic; &quot;Apollo&#x27;s Frock&quot; appears on &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Hidden Treasures&quot; (2004); and &quot;Walk to Dublin&quot;, which was left off the album after disagreements over the musical structure of the song between Amos and her label, then revisited again during the &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; (1998) recording sessions, was not released until &quot;A Piano: The Collection&quot; (2006).

Another song, &quot;To the Fair Motormaids of Japan&quot;, was also recorded during the &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; recording sessions. It was released on a deluxe remastered rerelease of the album on November 18, 2016.

The &quot;Hey Jupiter&quot; EP includes live performances of some of Amos&#x27;s previously released B-sides, including a cover of &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot;, listed as &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;. Amos also covered &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot;, &quot;Landslide&quot;, and &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; on &quot;VH1 Crossroads&quot;.

One of her legs is out of her pants and flung over the side of the chair. A snake coils around the chair and a large rooster hangs from the roof of the porch. The image is a nod to her song &quot;Me and a Gun,&quot; which appears on the album &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; and recounts a rape she suffered. &quot;Well, it&#x27;s [the cover of the album] a reference to &#x27;Me and a Gun&#x27;, a song I wrote that was on &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;. And the idea that there&#x27;s a dead cock on my right and a live snake on my left. And the idea is that death and life ... creation ... what it&#x27;s taken me to get here with men, and I don&#x27;t want to be angry anymore. And you turn it over and you put the gun down, but I&#x27;m not pretending what it&#x27;s taken to get me here. But no more resentment.&quot; [Live105 San Francisco (radio) – February 7, 1996] It was taken by Cindy Palmano in October 1995 in New Orleans.

==Promotion==
In late 1995, Atlantic released a promotional-only CD in Germany and America simply titled &quot;Tori Amos&quot;, under catalog number PRCD-6535-2. &quot;New Music from Tori Amos ...&quot; appeared on the front cover, and upon opening the jewel case, &quot;... is coming soon&quot; appears on the back of the insert. The release is a 9-track promotional compilation of Amos&#x27;s singles from her first two solo albums, meant for radio stations to play to generate interest in the forthcoming album. The track &quot;Precious Things&quot; is mislabeled as &quot;These Precious Things&quot; on both the CD and the back cover, while &quot;Crucify (Remix)&quot; is listed when in fact the album version of the song is included.

The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot;, was released commercially and to radio stations on January 2, 1996, three weeks prior to the album&#x27;s release.

Amos&#x27;s marketing team made use of the internet to market and promote &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;. Some reviews provided links to the Atlantic homepage or to Amos&#x27;s homepage to listen to audio clips from the album, while others provided telephone numbers to call to listen to audio clips. &quot;Caught a Lite Sneeze&quot; was notable in being one of the first singles to have its worldwide release on the internet as a free download.

==Critical reception==

Critics overall praised the album&#x27;s expanded instrumentation, and the acoustics that recording the album in a church afforded, but otherwise reaction to the album was polarized, particularly with regard to the lyrics. &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; is more lyrically dense than Amos&#x27;s two previous albums, taking poetic obscurity to new heights. Some critics praised its ultra-personal lyrics while others panned what they called its overt and excessive self-indulgence and &quot;ozone-layer lyrics&quot; described as unfathomable, impenetrable, and personally opaque. One scathing review suggested skipping the album, instead reading something &quot;a little bit more intelligible—like maybe &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; written in Greek&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; went as far to bluntly say that most of the album&#x27;s lyrics are &quot;ultimately mystifying and, well, bad&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; assigned the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating, indicating &quot;a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought.&quot;

One reviewer observed that Amos&#x27; unfettered creativity due to serving as her own producer cost the album its accessibility. Amos has stated that her goal was not to make radio-friendly music with universal lyrics, and went on to say that &quot;a song is only part lyrics and, for me anyway, more than 50% music, easy. There&#x27;s so much subtext in the music that&#x27;s part of the story.&quot;

Amy Gentry has noted the gendered way that many critics, male and female alike, approached the album. This included mockery of Amos&#x27; performance style for being overly sexualized, and criticisms of the supposed lesbian subtext in the album&#x27;s lyrics.

===Accolades===
The album was nominated for a Grammy in 1996 for Best Alternative Album, losing to Beck&#x27;s &quot;Odelay&quot;.

Despite receiving mixed reviews upon its release, &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; has gone on to become a strong-selling album and to be cited as having been critically underrated. In 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; on its list of 1,000 Albums To Hear Before You Die.

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 102,000 copies in its first week, going on to achieve RIAA Gold certification in the US by early March. The album debuted at number two in the UK as well, making it the highest-charting transatlantic debut of any of Amos&#x27;s albums. Prior to its release, the album achieved BPI Silver certification in the UK, followed by BPI Gold certification in March. By May, US sales were already nearing Platinum certification status when &quot;Talula&quot;, the album&#x27;s second US single, which also appeared in the film &quot;Twister&quot;, was released and accompanied by a sticker that read, &quot;From Tori&#x27;s new album &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; – 900,000 and climbing!&quot;. Dance remixes of &quot;Professional Widow&quot; were released in July and by the end of the month the single reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in the US, as well as topping the charts in Italy and the United Kingdom. The successful releases of &quot;Talula&quot; and subsequently &quot;Professional Widow&quot; surged albums sales enough that &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; achieved RIAA Platinum certification in August, the day after the US release of the &quot;Hey Jupiter&quot; EP.

The success of remixes from this album led to the album being reissued in both the US and the UK. In the US, the original version of &quot;Talula&quot; was replaced by &quot;Talula (The Tornado Mix),&quot; which incorporates a minor dance beat. In the UK, &quot;Talula (The Tornado Mix)&quot; replaced the original version of the song and a remix of &quot;Professional Widow&quot; was added to the album, immediately following the original version of the song. As a result of the extra &quot;Professional Widow&quot; track, the song &quot;In the Springtime of His Voodoo&quot; was removed completely.

&quot;In the Springtime of His Voodoo&quot; was also remixed and released as a dance single, but was a much smaller club success. Interest in the album resurfaced when Amos sang vocals on &quot;Blue Skies&quot;, another club and dance hit by dance music artist BT that reached number one on the Hot Dance/Club Play chart exactly one year after the release of &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;.

&quot;Boys for Pele&quot; remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 29 weeks throughout 1996, before falling off the chart in mid September. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the album ranked number 100 on the Year-End Album Charts of 1996 in the U.S. in December. To date, &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; is Amos&#x27;s third-best selling album in the U.S.

In early 2016, Tori Amos announced via Twitter that the album is slated for a deluxe reissue later in the year, following the deluxe re-releases of her first two albums in 2015.

==Reissues==
&quot;Boys for Pele&quot; was reissued in the United States in June 1996. This reissue replaced the original version of &quot;Talula&quot; with the &quot;Tornado Mix&quot;. In February 1997, the album was reissued in the United Kingdom following the success of &quot;Professional Widow&quot;. This &#x27;Special Edition&#x27; inserted the full 8-minute Armand&#x27;s Star Trunk Funkin&#x27; Mix of &quot;Professional Widow&quot; between the original version and &quot;Mr. Zebra&quot; and replaced the original version of &quot;Talula&quot; with the Tornado Mix version. Due to time restrictions, the U.K. reissue removed the song &quot;In the Springtime of His Voodoo&quot;.

A double-CD 20th Anniversary Deluxe edition of &quot;Boys for Pele&quot; was released on November 11, 2016 by Rhino Records. This edition restored the album back to its original track list and had a bonus CD with twenty-one tracks, four of which were previously unreleased. 
&quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine praised the reissue, stating that the bonus material &quot;will be difficult for fans to resist&quot;.

<doc id="88732" wikidata="Q2298200" url="?curid=88732" title="Scarlet's Walk">
<text>Scarlet&#x27;s Walk is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter and pianist Tori Amos. It was released on October 28, 2002 in the UK and October 29 in the US on Epic Records, making it her first release on the label after her split with Atlantic Records. Her first studio album of original material since &quot;To Venus and Back&quot; in 1999, the 18-track concept album (described by Amos as a &quot;sonic novel about a road trip&quot;) details the cross-country travels of Scarlet, a character loosely based on Amos, and was greatly inspired by the changes in American society and politics post-September 11, 2001. Topics explored on the album include nationalism, personal relationships, and the death of a close friend. Amos also took inspiration from the stories of her grandfather, who she claims was Cherokee and told her of the abuses against Native Americans throughout the United States&#x27; history.

Recorded at Amos&#x27;s Martian Engineering in Cornwall, England, &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; solidified Amos&#x27;s current backing band of Jon Evans on bass, Matt Chamberlain on drums, and Mac Aladdin on guitar. Additionally, string arrangements were provided by John Philip Shenale. The self-produced album diverts from the electronica and trip hop-influenced sounds of &quot;From the Choirgirl Hotel&quot; and &quot;To Venus and Back&quot; and marks a return to the stripped-back sound of her earlier work with a greater emphasis on live instrumentation and Amos&#x27;s piano, while also incorporating new keyboard instruments into the arrangements, such as the prominent use of Wurlitzer and Fender Rhodes electric pianos. The packaging featured Polaroid-esque photography by Kurt Markus. &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; would also be released as limited-edition box set with bonus content.

The album was a commercial success, reaching number seven in the US and becoming Amos&#x27;s fourth top 10 album. It sold 107,000 copies in its first week and reached RIAA Gold status about a month after its release. It spawned the singles &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;, &quot;Taxi Ride&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Come to Vegas&quot;, the former reaching number two on the US adult alternative chart and becoming one of her most popular songs. Considered one of her best and most conceptually elaborate works, it received positive reviews and was supported by the &quot;On Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; tour throughout 2002-03.

==Background==

&quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; was the follow-up to Amos&#x27; previous album &quot;Strange Little Girls&quot;, which was released in 2001 and fulfilled her contract with Atlantic Records. A primary motivation for Amos&#x27; switch from Atlantic to Epic was the presence of Polly Anthony, the president of Epic, whom Amos felt would be committed to properly promoting her work as she had felt that Atlantic had not promoted her recent releases to the proper extent and had felt trapped in her contract due to the label&#x27;s refusal to sell her to another label. Amos would later experience further frustrations as Anthony stepped down from her position after the release of &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; in 2003.

In addition to cementing her longest-running backing lineup, guitar contributions were also made by David Torn and Robbie McIntosh. It would become Amos&#x27; fourth consecutive release to be primarily recorded at her studio, Martian Engineering in Cornwall, England. Production was handled by Amos (as has been the case for all her albums since &quot;Boys for Pele&quot;), and the album was mixed by her husband Mark Hawley and Marcel van Limbeek.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; follows the journey of the titular character across America after September 11, 2001, and the songs describe her encounters with various characters and facets of American life after the attacks. At the time, Amos&#x27; recent releases experimented heavily with electronic elements, with extensive use of synthesizers in place of her piano on many songs. &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; was a conscious return to a stripped-down sound, with Amos saying in an interview with &quot;Keyboard Magazine&quot;: 

Additionally, she looked to 1970s-era albums as references for the songs&#x27; overall structures and sound, with Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rumours&quot; and Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot; being listed as particularly significant influences.

&quot;Amber Waves&quot;, the album&#x27;s opening track, describes Scarlet&#x27;s encounter with a porn star of the same name. The name &quot;Amber Waves&quot; is both a reference to a character from the film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, as well as the lyric &quot;amber waves of grain&quot; from &quot;America the Beautiful&quot;. The song describes the toll the character&#x27;s work has taken on her and how her dreams of becoming a successful actress have gone awry (&quot;From ballet class to lap dance and straight to video&quot;). On certain occasions, Amos has integrated portions of &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; into &quot;Amber Waves&quot; in live performances. &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, tells the story of the melancholy of Scarlet&#x27;s experience taking a drive up the Pacific Coast Highway with someone whom she is in a failing relationship with. As Amos described in the &quot;&quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; bio&quot;, a press release for the album, &quot;They take the big trip in the classic car up the Pacific Coast highway and across the desert. But as they go on, the masks drop away and they discover the fantasy they have of each other isn&#x27;t who they really are.&quot; The Southern boogie-style &quot;Wednesday&quot; contains multiple short movements with varying instrumentation, including sections featuring a full band arrangement and wah-wah guitar, to solo piano-and-vocal sections. Amos described the song as depicting Scarlet&#x27;s relationship with &quot;a man who harbours secrets&quot;, extending the song&#x27;s meaning to the peoples&#x27; trust in the ideals of America and how that trust is broken.

&quot;Strange&quot; is the first of many songs on the album to tackle the unjust treatment of Native Americans in the United States. The &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; bio describes this part of the character&#x27;s journey as &quot;[taking] her to the sites of some of the last stands of the native American people, including Little Big Horn. From there she journeys on through the Bad Lands.&quot; The song was later released as a promotional single. &quot;Carbon&quot; describes Scarlet&#x27;s meeting with a character sharing the song&#x27;s name who suffers from bipolar disorder. Skiing imagery is heavily present throughout the lyrics, with references to ski runs such as &quot;bear&#x27;s claw&quot;, &quot;free fall&quot;, and &quot;gunner&#x27;s view&quot;; both carbon and skiing are used as metaphors for the character&#x27;s desire to partake in self-destructive behaviors (&quot;carbon made only wants to be unmade&quot;). The song experiments with mixed meter, frequently shifting between and .

The a cappella &quot;Wampum Prayer&quot; also tackles the subject of the atrocities committed against Native Americans, with Scarlet hearing the voice and song of an old Apache woman, a survivor of a massacre whose site Scarlet has recently visited. The song was used to open each night of the &quot;On Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; tour. Featuring prominent fretless bass playing from Evans, &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Come to Vegas&quot; revolves around Scarlet struggling with a call from her niece who is being mistreated by a man she has committed to a relationship with. As Amos said in &quot;Scarlet Stories&quot;, &quot;it&#x27;s one of those moments where, even if you have a resolve to not go to a place and do something, there&#x27;s something that pulls at you, especially when you remember somebody as a little girl.&quot; The &quot;Timo on Tori&quot; remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Come to Vegas&quot; would become a dance hit for Amos after being released (along with other remixes of the song) as the album&#x27;s third single in 2003. In &quot;Sweet Sangria&quot;, Scarlet meets a &quot;revolutionary-type character&quot; fighting American intervention in Central and South America. While Scarlet supports the cause of the revolutionaries, she struggles to commit to violence against either side: &quot;although she believes in the cause, she can&#x27;t load the gun... It&#x27;s about what you believe in and how far you&#x27;re prepared to go.&quot; In &quot;Your Cloud&quot;, Scarlet arrives at a monument mourning Cherokee Native Americans who were killed in the Trail of Tears. The song revolves around the themes of separation: &quot;Pancake&quot; criticizes those who use their power to rally people for certain causes without fighting for said causes themselves. The song sees Scarlet encounter a &quot;Messiah figure&quot; who exploits his power and influence: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t uphold the values which he preaches. He&#x27;s deaf to the real needs of the people and is becoming drunk on the kind of power which he once denounced.&quot; Despite its apparent association with the September 11 attacks, &quot;I Can&#x27;t See New York&quot; was written months earlier. In the song, Scarlet witnesses a plane crash whilst on a plane herself, and experiences the fear and panic felt by a woman on the crashed plane before her death. &quot;Mrs. Jesus&quot; depicts Scarlet&#x27;s encounter with a character of the same name; the song tackles the subject of religious fanatisicm and the effects of Christianity on America&#x27;s history. &quot;Taxi Ride&quot; is a partial &quot;homage&quot; to the late make-up artist Kevyn Aucoin, a friend of Amos&#x27;s who died in May 2002, and served as the second single from the album. An on-line contest was held asking fans to direct and submit a music video for the song. Amos said of the song and its connection to Aucoin: 
Scarlet makes her way into Florida in &quot;Another Girl&#x27;s Paradise&quot;, a song which relates to the different dimensions of relationships between women, and feelings of envy and intimidation. The title track took inspiration from stories told to Amos by her grandfather, who she claims was Cherokee. The song depicts the climax of Scarlet&#x27;s story, where after meeting other characters during her journey and seeing their path, she has decided on her own. Amos has also stated that the song was written to expose the Indian Removal Act in 1830 and its stealing of Native American land. &quot;Virginia&quot; tackles the hypocrisy of a nation built on notions of freedom denying it to the Native American population. The song personifies America as a young girl, and explores the concept of being able to warn it about the troubles that will come in the future. The song features McIntosh playing a Dobro resonator guitar. In the heavily orchestrated closing track, &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, Scarlet has given birth to her daughter and has the experience of having another life depending on her. Additionally, Amos has stated that the song is about &quot;being other people and feeling how they feel&quot;, and how one&#x27;s own personal experiences stick with themselves and create their story (Amos uses the metaphor of a &quot;body map&quot; in the Scarlet Stories commentary). The song was later re-recorded on, and lent its name to, Amos&#x27; 2012 album &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, featuring orchestrated re-recordings of songs from her back catalogue.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; saw release on October 28, 2002 in the UK and was released a day later in the US. Peaking at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, it became her fourth album to reach the top ten in the US. The album would also reach the top 20 in six additional countries (including a top ten placement in Germany) and be certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000 copies. In addition to the standard release, a limited edition box set was released with slightly altered cover art, a bonus disc (&quot;Scarlet&#x27;s DVD&quot;, which included content for &quot;Gold Dust&quot;, &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;, and &quot;Taxi Ride&quot;), and collectibles. Advance copies of the album sent to reviewers were sealed inside Sony Walkman players with glue to prevent Internet trading of the album. Headphones were also glued to the players to prevent listeners from connecting recording devices to them. As another incentive to curb piracy, the physical CD release provided entry to &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Web&quot;, a website that was the sole source for additional tracks, tour photos, and other content. All tracks included on &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Web&quot; (with the exception of &quot;Mountain&quot;) would later be included on the &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Hidden Treasures&quot; EP, released as a companion to the 2004 live video &quot;Welcome to Sunny Florida&quot;. &quot;Scarlet Stories&quot;, a disc of commentary by Amos about each of the album&#x27;s songs, was released as part of the &quot;Get Tori as a Gift — Get a Gift From Tori&quot; promotion, being given as a free bonus to those who bought two copies of &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; at indie retailers.

&quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot; (backed with the non-album track &quot;Operation Peter Pan&quot;) was released as the album&#x27;s first single and reached number two on the US Triple A chart and 14 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 and became one of her biggest radio hits. A music video was made for the song, directed by Sanji. It depicts Amos as a head with a disembodied leg falling in love with a head with a disembodied arm (played by Adrien Brody). After kissing, the video ends with them growing the rest of their body parts, and becoming &quot;whole&quot; from their love. The music video later received its own DVD release, with extras including a &quot;making of&quot; for the video and an interview with Amos. The second single, &quot;Taxi Ride&quot;, reached number 20 on the US Triple A chart and number 35 on the Adult Top 40. Remixes of &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Come to Vegas&quot; by Timo Maas served as the third and final single from the album. The single (Amos&#x27; last commercially available, physical single release to date) reached number six on the US Dance Club Songs chart and number 12 on the Dance Singles Sales chart in the summer of 2003. Finally, &quot;Strange&quot; would receive a promotional single release later that year.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; garnered a positive reception from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76 based on 21 reviews, indicating &quot;generally positive reviews&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; gave the album a score of 9 out of 10 and referred to it as &quot;As ambitious as anything in recent pop music memory,&quot; going on to call it &quot;one of the most invigorating and arresting works of her career.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album 4.5 stars out of 5, stating the album &quot;marks a return to the sound and feel of &quot;Under the Pink&quot;&quot; and called &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; Amos&#x27;s best album since that release.

In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;Tori Amos Album Guide&quot;, &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; received a rating of 3.5 out of 5, with the magazine calling it &quot;her most carefully crafted and inviting album since &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot;&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; gave the album a perfect 5 out of 5 score, calling it &quot;her most fully realized [album] yet&quot; and highlighting the songs&#x27; arrangements and imagery.

<doc id="88733" wikidata="Q607641" url="?curid=88733" title="Laufey (mythology)">
<text>Laufey or Nál is a figure in Norse mythology and the mother of Loki. The latter is frequently mentioned by the matronymic &quot;Loki Laufeyjarson&quot; (Old Norse &#x27;Loki Laufey&#x27;s son&#x27;) in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, rather than the expected traditional patronymic Loki &quot;Fárbautason&quot; (&#x27;son of Fárbauti&#x27;), in a mythology where kinship is usually reckoned through male ancestry.

== Name ==
The meaning of the Old Norse name &quot;Laufey&quot; is not clear, but it is generally taken to be related to &quot;lauf&quot; (&#x27;leaves, foliage&#x27;), perhaps attached to the suffix -&quot;ey&quot; (found in female personal names like &quot;Bjargey&quot;, &quot;Þórey)&quot;, or deriving from an hypothetical tree-goddess named &quot;*lauf-awiaz&quot; (&#x27;the leafy&#x27;).

Since the name of her spouse &quot;Fárbauti&quot; means &quot;dangerous hitter&quot;, a possible natural mythological interpretation has been proposed by some scholars, with lightning hitting the leaves, or needles of a tree to give rise to fire.

==Attestations==
In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (&#x27;The Beguiling of Gylfi&#x27;), High introduces Loki as the son of Fárbauti, that &quot;Laufey or Nál&quot; is his mother, and that his brothers are Býleistr and Helblindi. Elsewhere in the same poem, Loki is referred to by the matronymic &quot;Laufeyson&quot; (&#x27;Laufey&#x27;s son&#x27;). This occurs twice more in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and once in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

&quot;Skaldskaparmal&quot; (&#x27;The Language of Poetry&#x27;) mentions Loki as &#x27;son of Fárbauti&#x27; or &#x27;son of Laufey&#x27;.

Laufey is listed among Ásynjar (goddesses) in one of the &quot;þulur&quot;, an ancestry that perhaps led her son Loki to be &quot;enumerated among the Æsir&quot;, as Snorri Sturluson puts it in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;.

&quot;Nál&quot; is mentioned twice in the Prose Edda as &quot;Laufey or Nál&quot;; once in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; and once in &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;.

In the poem &quot;Sörla tháttr&quot;, Nál and Laufey are portrayed as the same person: &quot;She was both slender and weak, and for that reason she was called Nál [Needle].&quot; According to scholar John Lindow, however, &quot;the late date of the text makes this piece of information suspect.&quot;

<text>Fárbauti (Old Norse) is a jötunn in Norse mythology. In all sources, he is portrayed as the father of Loki. Fárbauti is attested in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and in kennings of Viking Age skalds.

== Name ==
The Old Norse name has been translated as &#x27;dangerous striker&#x27;, &#x27;anger striker&#x27;, or &#x27;sudden-striker&#x27;. It is a compound formed with the noun (&#x27;hostility, danger, unfortunateness, falseness&#x27;) attached to the verb (&#x27;to strike&#x27;).

== Attestations ==

Two 10th-century skalds call Loki &quot;son of Fárbauti&quot;, using, however, the poetic word &quot;mögr&quot; for &#x27;son&#x27; rather than the usual &quot;sonr&quot;.

The skald Úlfr Uggason is quoted referring to Loki as &quot;Fárbauti&#x27;s terribly sly son&quot;, and the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir mentions Loki as &quot;Fárbauti&#x27;s son&quot;.

In &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (&#x27;The Beguiling of Gylfi&#x27;), the enthroned figure of High states that Loki is the son of the jötunn Fárbauti, and that &quot;Laufey or Nál is his mother&quot;.
In &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (&#x27;The Language of Poetry&#x27;), Fárbauti is mentioned among kennings referring to his son Loki.
==Theories==
Axel Kock has proposed Fárbauti&#x27;s name and character may have been inspired by the observation of the natural phenomena surrounding the appearance of wildfire. If &quot;Fárbauti&quot; as &quot;dangerous striker&quot; refers to &quot;lightning&quot;, the figure would appear to be part of an early nature myth alluding to wildfire (Loki) being produced by lightning (Fárbauti) striking dry tinder such as leaves (Laufey) or pine needles (Nál).

Although only indirectly attested in a kenning of &quot;Völuspá&quot; (&#x27;Prophecy of the Völva&#x27;) mentioning Loki as &quot;Byleist’s brother&quot;, some scholars have considered Loki&#x27;s brothers Helblindi and Býleistr to also be sons of Fárbauti. However, their exact role in the presumably ancient mythic complex surrounding Loki&#x27;s family remains largely unclear.

<text>In Norse mythology, Móði (Old Norse: ; anglicized Módi or Mothi) and Magni are the sons of Thor. Their names translate to &quot;Wrath&quot; and &quot;Mighty,&quot; respectively. Rudolf Simek states that, along with Thor&#x27;s daughter Þrúðr (&quot;Strength&quot;), they embody their father&#x27;s features.

Móði and Magni&#x27;s descent from Thor is attested by the kennings &quot;Móði&#x27;s father&quot; (&quot;faðir Móða&quot;, in &quot;Hymiskviða&quot;, ) and &quot;Magni&#x27;s father&quot; (&quot;faðir Magna&quot;, in &quot;Þórsdrápa&quot; and &quot;Hárbarðsljóð&quot;, ). Snorri Sturluson confirms it (&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, , &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, ). According to &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; Magni is the son of Thor and the Jötunn Járnsaxa.

==&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;==
The two brothers are mentioned among the survivors of Ragnarök in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;:
==&quot;Prose Edda&quot;==
Apart from his role after Ragnarök, there is nothing we know about Móði but, in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Magni plays a role in the myth of Thor&#x27;s battle with the giant Hrungnir:
:But the hammer Mjöllnir struck Hrungnir in the middle of the head, and smashed his skull into small crumbs, and he fell forward upon Thor, so that his foot lay over Thor&#x27;s neck. Thjálfi struck at Mökkurkálfi, and he fell with little glory. Thereupon Thjálfi went over to Thor and would have lifted Hrungnir&#x27;s foot off him, but could not find sufficient strength. Straightway all the Æsir came up, when they, learned that Thor was fallen, and would have lifted the foot from off him, and could do nothing. Then Magni came up, son of Thor and Járnsaxa: he was then three nights old; he cast the foot of Hrungnir off Thor, and spake: &#x27;See how ill it is, father, that I came so late: I had struck this giant dead with my fist, methinks, if I had met with him.&#x27; Thor arose and welcomed his son, saying that he should surely become great; &#x27;And I will give thee, he said, the horse Gold-Mane, which Hrungnir possessed.&#x27; Then Odin spake and said that Thor did wrong to give the good horse to the son of a giantess, and not to his father.
::—&quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; , Brodeur&#x27;s translation
John Lindow draws a parallel between Magni and Odin&#x27;s son Váli for they both have a giantess mother (Rindr for Váli) and achieve a feat at a very young age (Váli is only one day old when he kills Höðr, thus avenging Baldr&#x27;s death).

<text>Herpetoculture is the keeping of live reptiles and amphibians in captivity, whether as a hobby or as a commercial breeding operation. &quot;Herps&quot; is an informal term for both reptiles and amphibians, shortened from the scientific umbrella term “herptiles”. It is undertaken by people of all ages and from all walks of life, including career herpetologists, professional reptile or amphibian breeders, and casual hobbyists.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;herpetoculture&quot; is credited to Tom Huff, who devised the word to distinguish what he, as a self-described &quot;herpetoculturist&quot;, was doing—working to keeping reptiles and amphibians alive and healthy—from what herpetologists of that era were generally doing, namely, collecting specimens for preservation in museum collections. The word itself comes from the Greek language origin , which means &quot;to creep&quot;.

==Equipment==

=== Enclosures ===
Though traditional glass aquariums and terrariums are still widely used, in recent years glass and fiberglass cages designed specifically for herps have become more widely available. Many herpetoculturists prefer these newer enclosures as they come in larger sizes, are more secure, can be stacked, and are more easily modified to included heat and humidity sources. At one time it was commonly accepted to keep multiple creatures in a small enclosure; however, current cage size recommendations discourage this. These size recommendations differ depending on the species and its natural environment.

===Vivaria===
As reptiles are cold blooded they generally need to be kept in climate-controlled enclosures, especially when kept in regions further away from the equator. A standard enclosure usually incorporates a thermostat and a heat emitter; usually a heating pad, heat tape or an incandescent light bulb. Hot rocks can be used, but as a secondary heat source, as they often provide uneven heating. Some reptiles also require some form of Ultraviolet radiation which can be provided through a UV bulb. The lighting can be set to a timer to simulate a day/night cycle. Heat emitters are usually placed at one end of the enclosure to allow for a temperature gradient, so a reptile may move to the other end of the enclosure if it needs to cool itself.

===Incubators===
Many reptiles are oviparous and will lay eggs if successfully mated. Breeders may use incubators to increase their chances of successful hatching. Reptilian incubators generally consist of a thermostat and hygrometer, plus various heating and misting devices, as to create a stable environment. Unlike most avian eggs, reptile eggs do not need to be turned; in the wild they are generally laid in mounds or underground and left to incubate.

==Husbandry==

===Feeding===
Reptiles and amphibians can be omnivores, carnivores, or herbivores. Omnivorous reptiles can be fed species-dependent mixes of plant or meat-based foods, with additional supplementation, most commonly calcium. Carnivorous reptiles may need living or dried insects or whole rodents. Frozen rodents can be bought from pet shops and are then thawed before feeding, and live rodents can be kept and sustained before feeding. Some species of reptiles will also feed on smaller reptiles.

===Breeding===
Many species of reptiles have a seasonal breeding cycle. For example, in southern Australia, the Eastern Long Neck turtle brumates over winter before mating in spring. Herpetoculturists who wish to breed their reptiles may have to alter the environment in the vivarium to simulate seasons to encourage successful mating. Amphibians are easily bred in captivity. Due to their small size and low-maintenance requirements, large captive populations can be substantiated easily and for a low-cost compared to other organisms.

==Controversy==
While commonly kept species of reptiles and amphibians are typically captive bred rather than field-collected, capture of wild animals for the exotic pet trade can have an adverse impact on wild populations. Additionally, exotic species may escape from or be released by irresponsible pet owners and become invasive species.

<doc id="88750" wikidata="Q517807" url="?curid=88750" title="G-spot">
<text>The G-spot, also called the Gräfenberg spot (for German gynecologist Ernst Gräfenberg), is characterized as an erogenous area of the vagina that, when stimulated, may lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and potential female ejaculation. It is typically reported to be located up the front (anterior) vaginal wall between the vaginal opening and the urethra and is a sensitive area that may be part of the female prostate.

The existence of the G-spot has not been proven, nor has the source of female ejaculation. Although the G-spot has been studied since the 1940s, disagreement persists over its existence as a distinct structure, definition and location. The G-spot may be an extension of the clitoris, which together may be the cause of orgasms experienced vaginally. Sexologists and other researchers are concerned that women may consider themselves to be dysfunctional if they do not experience G-spot stimulation, and emphasize that not experiencing it is normal.

==Theorized structure==
===Location===
Two primary methods have been used to define and locate the G-spot as a sensitive area in the vagina: self-reported levels of arousal during stimulation, and stimulation of the G-spot leading to female ejaculation. Ultrasound technology has also been used to identify physiological differences between women, and changes to the G-spot region during sexual activity.

The location of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80 mm (2 to 3 in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area has been described as needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.

===Vagina and clitoris===
Women usually need direct clitoral stimulation in order to orgasm, and G-spot stimulation may be best achieved by using both manual stimulation and vaginal penetration. A yoni massage also includes manual stimulation of the G-spot.

Sex toys are available for G-spot stimulation. One common sex toy is the specially-designed G-spot vibrator, which is a phallic vibrator that has a curved tip and attempts to make G-spot stimulation easy. G-spot vibrators are made from the same materials as regular vibrators, ranging from hard plastic, rubber, silicone, jelly, or any combination of them. The level of vaginal penetration when using a G-spot vibrator depends on the woman, because women&#x27;s physiology is not always the same. The effects of G-spot stimulation when using the penis or a G-spot vibrator may be enhanced by additionally stimulating other erogenous zones on a woman&#x27;s body, such as the clitoris or vulva as a whole. When using a G-spot vibrator, this may be done by manually stimulating the clitoris, including by using the vibrator as a clitoral vibrator, or, if the vibrator is designed for it, by applying it so that it stimulates the head of the clitoris, the rest of the vulva and the vagina simultaneously.

A 1981 case study reported that stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall made the area grow by fifty percent and that self-reported levels of arousal/orgasm were deeper when the G-spot was stimulated. Another study, in 1983, examined eleven women by palpating the entire vagina in a clockwise fashion, and reported a specific response to stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall in four of the women, concluding that the area is the G-spot. In a 1990 study, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 2,350 professional women in the United States and Canada with a subsequent 55% return rate. Of these respondents, 40% reported having a fluid release (ejaculation) at the moment of orgasm, and 82% of the women who reported the sensitive area (Gräfenberg spot) also reported ejaculation with their orgasms. Several variables were associated with this perceived existence of female ejaculation.

Some research suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson were the first to determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women&#x27;s sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation is the source of both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.

Researchers at the University of L&#x27;Aquila, using ultrasonography, presented evidence that women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically more likely to have thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.

Supporting Spector&#x27;s conclusion is a study published in 2005 which investigates the size of the clitoris – it suggests that clitoral tissue extends into the anterior wall of the vagina. The main researcher of the studies, Australian urologist Helen O&#x27;Connell, asserts that this interconnected relationship is the physiological explanation for the conjectured G-spot and experience of vaginal orgasms, taking into account the stimulation of the internal parts of the clitoris during vaginal penetration. While using MRI technology, O&#x27;Connell noted a direct relationship between the legs or roots of the clitoris and the erectile tissue of the &quot;clitoral bulbs&quot; and corpora, and the distal urethra and vagina. &quot;The vaginal wall is, in fact, the clitoris,&quot; said O&#x27;Connell. &quot;If you lift the skin off the vagina on the side walls, you get the bulbs of the clitoris – triangular, crescental masses of erectile tissue.&quot; O&#x27;Connell et al., who performed dissections on the female genitals of cadavers and used photography to map the structure of nerves in the clitoris, were already aware that the clitoris is more than just its glans and asserted in 1998 that there is more erectile tissue associated with the clitoris than is generally described in anatomical textbooks. They concluded that some females have more extensive clitoral tissues and nerves than others, especially having observed this in young cadavers as compared to elderly ones, and therefore whereas the majority of females can only achieve orgasm by direct stimulation of the external parts of the clitoris, the stimulation of the more generalized tissues of the clitoris via intercourse may be sufficient for others.

French researchers Odile Buisson and Pierre Foldès reported similar findings to those of O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s. In 2008, they published the first complete 3D sonography of the stimulated clitoris, and republished it in 2009 with new research, demonstrating the ways in which erectile tissue of the clitoris engorges and surrounds the vagina. On the basis of this research, they argued that women may be able to achieve vaginal orgasm via stimulation of the G-spot because the highly innervated clitoris is pulled closely to the anterior wall of the vagina when the woman is sexually aroused and during vaginal penetration. They assert that since the front wall of the vagina is inextricably linked with the internal parts of the clitoris, stimulating the vagina without activating the clitoris may be next to impossible. In their 2009 published study, the &quot;coronal planes during perineal contraction and finger penetration demonstrated a close relationship between the root of the clitoris and the anterior vaginal wall&quot;. Buisson and Foldès suggested &quot;that the special sensitivity of the lower anterior vaginal wall could be explained by pressure and movement of clitoris&#x27;s root during a vaginal penetration and subsequent perineal contraction&quot;.

===Female prostate===
In 2001, the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology accepted &quot;female prostate&quot; as a second term for the Skene&#x27;s gland, which is believed to be found in the G-spot area along the walls of the urethra. The male prostate is biologically homologous to the Skene&#x27;s gland; it has been unofficially called the male G-spot because it can also be used as an erogenous zone.

Regnier de Graaf, in 1672, observed that the secretions (female ejaculation) by the erogenous zone in the vagina lubricate &quot;in agreeable fashion during coitus&quot;. Modern scientific hypotheses linking G-spot sensitivity with female ejaculation led to the idea that non-urine female ejaculate may originate from the Skene&#x27;s gland, with the Skene&#x27;s gland and male prostate acting similarly in terms of prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific acid phosphatase studies, which led to a trend of calling the Skene&#x27;s glands the female prostate. Additionally, the enzyme PDE5 (involved with erectile dysfunction) has additionally been associated with the G-spot area. Because of these factors, it has been argued that the G-spot is a system of glands and ducts located within the anterior (front) wall of the vagina. A similar approach has linked the G-spot with the urethral sponge.

==Clinical significance==

G-spot amplification (also called G-spot augmentation or the G-Shot) is a procedure intended to temporarily increase pleasure in sexually active women with normal sexual function, focusing on increasing the size and sensitivity of the G-spot. G-spot amplification is performed by attempting to locate the G-spot and noting measurements for future reference. After numbing the area with a local anesthetic, human engineered collagen is then injected directly under the mucosa in the area the G-spot is concluded to be in.

A position paper published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns that there is no valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.

==Society and culture==

===General skepticism===
In addition to general skepticism among gynecologists, sexologists and other researchers that the G-spot exists, a team at King&#x27;s College London in late 2009 suggested that its existence is subjective. They acquired the largest sample size of women to date – 1,800 – who are pairs of twins, and found that the twins did not report a similar G-spot in their questionnaires. The research, headed by Tim Spector, documents a 15-year study of the twins, identical and non-identical. According to the researchers, if one identical twin reported having a G-spot, it was more likely that the other would too, but this pattern did not materialize. Study co-author Andrea Burri believes: &quot;It is rather irresponsible to claim the existence of an entity that has never been proven and pressurise women and men too.&quot; She stated that one of the reasons for the research was to remove feelings of &quot;inadequacy or underachievement&quot; for women who feared they lacked a G-spot. Researcher Beverly Whipple dismissed the findings, commenting that twins have different sexual partners and techniques, and that the study did not properly account for lesbian or bisexual women.

Petra Boynton, a British scientist who has written extensively on the G-spot debate, is also concerned about the promotion of the G-spot leading women to feel &quot;dysfunctional&quot; if they do not experience it. &quot;We&#x27;re all different. Some women will have a certain area within the vagina which will be very sensitive, and some won&#x27;t — but they won&#x27;t necessarily be in the area called the G spot,&quot; she stated. &quot;If a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal, or has a G spot or not, she will focus on just one area, and ignore everything else. It&#x27;s telling people that there is a single, best way to have sex, which isn&#x27;t the right thing to do.&quot;

===Nerve endings===
G-spot proponents are criticized for giving too much credence to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive evidence for a precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While the existence of a greater concentration of nerve endings at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of nerve endings.

Several researchers also consider the connection between the Skene&#x27;s gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.

===Clitoral and other anatomical debates===
The G-spot having an anatomical relationship with the clitoris has been challenged by Vincenzo Puppo, who, while agreeing that the clitoris is the center of female sexual pleasure, disagrees with Helen O&#x27;Connell and other researchers&#x27; terminological and anatomical descriptions of the clitoris. He stated, &quot;Clitoral bulbs is an incorrect term from an embryological and anatomical viewpoint, in fact the bulbs do not develop from the phallus, and they do not belong to the clitoris&quot;. He says that &quot;clitoral bulbs&quot; &quot;is not a term used in human anatomy&quot; and that &quot;vestibular bulbs&quot; is the correct term, adding that gynecologists and sexual experts should inform the public with facts instead of hypotheses or personal opinions. &quot;[C]litoral/vaginal/uterine orgasm, G/A/C/U spot orgasm, and female ejaculation, are terms that should not be used by sexologists, women, and mass media&quot;, he said, further commenting that the &quot;anterior vaginal wall is separated from the posterior urethral wall by the urethrovaginal septum (its thickness is 10–12 mm)&quot; and that the &quot;inner clitoris&quot; does not exist. &quot;The female perineal urethra, which is located in front of the anterior vaginal wall, is about one centimeter in length and the G-spot is located in the pelvic wall of the urethra, 2–3 cm into the vagina&quot;, Puppo stated. He believes that the penis cannot come in contact with the congregation of multiple nerves/veins situated until the angle of the clitoris, detailed by Georg Ludwig Kobelt, or with the roots of the clitoris, which do not have sensory receptors or erogenous sensitivity, during vaginal intercourse. He did, however, dismiss the orgasmic definition of the G-spot that emerged after Ernst Gräfenberg, stating that &quot;there is no anatomical evidence of the vaginal orgasm which was invented by Freud in 1905, without any scientific basis&quot;.

Puppo&#x27;s belief that there is no anatomical relationship between the vagina and clitoris is contrasted by the general belief among researchers that vaginal orgasms are the result of clitoral stimulation; they maintain that clitoral tissue extends, or is at least likely stimulated by the clitoral bulbs, even in the area most commonly reported to be the G-spot. &quot;My view is that the G-spot is really just the extension of the clitoris on the inside of the vagina, analogous to the base of the male penis&quot;, said researcher Amichai Kilchevsky. Because female fetal development is the &quot;default&quot; direction of fetal development in the absence of substantial exposure to male hormones and therefore the penis is essentially a clitoris enlarged by such hormones, Kilchevsky believes that there is no evolutionary reason why females would have two separate structures capable of producing orgasms and blames the porn industry and &quot;G-spot promoters&quot; for &quot;encouraging the myth&quot; of a distinct G-spot.

The general difficulty of achieving vaginal orgasms, which is a predicament that is likely due to nature easing the process of childbearing by drastically reducing the number of vaginal nerve endings, challenge arguments that vaginal orgasms help encourage sexual intercourse in order to facilitate reproduction. O&#x27;Connell stated that focusing on the G-spot to the exclusion of the rest of a woman&#x27;s body is &quot;a bit like stimulating a guy&#x27;s testicles without touching the penis and expecting an orgasm to occur just because love is present&quot;. She stated that it &quot;is best to think of the clitoris, urethra, and vagina as one unit because they are intimately related&quot;. Ian Kerner stated that the G-spot may be &quot;nothing more than the roots of the clitoris crisscrossing the urethral sponge&quot;.

A Rutgers University study, published in 2011, was the first to map the female genitals onto the sensory portion of the brain, and supports the possibility of a distinct G-spot. When the research team asked several women to stimulate themselves in a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) machine, brain scans showed stimulating the clitoris, vagina and cervix lit up distinct areas of the women&#x27;s sensory cortex, which means the brain registered distinct feelings between stimulating the clitoris, the cervix and the vaginal wall – where the G-spot is reported to be. &quot;I think that the bulk of the evidence shows that the G-spot is not a particular thing,&quot; stated Barry Komisaruk, head of the research findings. &quot;It&#x27;s not like saying, &#x27;What is the thyroid gland?&#x27; The G-spot is more of a thing like New York City is a thing. It&#x27;s a region, it&#x27;s a convergence of many different structures&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;The Journal of Sexual Medicine&quot; held a debate for both sides of the G-spot issue, concluding that further evidence is needed to validate the existence of the G-spot. In 2012, scholars Kilchevsky, Vardi, Lowenstein and Gruenwald stated in the journal, &quot;Reports in the public media would lead one to believe the G-spot is a well-characterized entity capable of providing extreme sexual stimulation, yet this is far from the truth&quot;. The authors cited that dozens of trials have attempted to confirm the existence of a G-spot using surveys, pathologic specimens, various imaging modalities, and biochemical markers, and concluded:The surveys found that a majority of women believe a G-spot actually exists, although not all of the women who believed in it were able to locate it. Attempts to characterize vaginal innervation have shown some differences in nerve distribution across the vagina, although the findings have not proven to be universally reproducible. Furthermore, radiographic studies have been unable to demonstrate a unique entity, other than the clitoris, whose direct stimulation leads to vaginal orgasm. Objective measures have failed to provide strong and consistent evidence for the existence of an anatomical site that could be related to the famed G-spot. However, reliable reports and anecdotal testimonials of the existence of a highly sensitive area in the distal anterior vaginal wall raise the question of whether enough investigative modalities have been implemented in the search of the G-spot.

A 2014 review from &quot;Nature Reviews Urology&quot; reported that &quot;no single structure consistent with a distinct G-spot has been identified&quot;.

==History==
The release of fluids had been seen by medical practitioners as beneficial to health. Within this context, various methods were used over the centuries to release &quot;female seed&quot; (via vaginal lubrication or female ejaculation) as a treatment for &quot;suffocation ex semine retento&quot; (suffocation of the womb), female hysteria or green sickness. Methods included a midwife rubbing the walls of the vagina or insertion of the penis or penis-shaped objects into the vagina. In the book &quot;History of V&quot;, lists old terms for what she believes refer to the female prostate (the Skene&#x27;s gland), including &quot;the little stream&quot;, &quot;the black pearl&quot; and &quot;palace of yin&quot; in China, &quot;the skin of the earthworm&quot; in Japan, and &quot;saspanda nadi&quot; in the India sex manual &quot;Ananga Ranga&quot;.

The 17th-century Dutch physician Regnier de Graaf described female ejaculation and referred to an erogenous zone in the vagina that he linked as homologous with the male prostate; this zone was later reported by the German gynecologist Ernst Gräfenberg. Coinage of the term &quot;G-spot&quot; has been credited to Addiego et al. in 1981, named after Gräfenberg, and to Alice Kahn Ladas and Beverly Whipple et al. in 1982. Gräfenberg&#x27;s 1940s research, however, was dedicated to urethral stimulation; Gräfenberg stated, &quot;An erotic zone always could be demonstrated on the anterior wall of the vagina along the course of the urethra&quot;. The concept of the G-spot entered popular culture with the 1982 publication of &quot;The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality&quot; by Ladas, Whipple and Perry, but it was criticized immediately by gynecologists: some of them denied its existence as the absence of arousal made it less likely to observe, and autopsy studies did not report it.

<text>In Norse mythology, Sinmara is a &quot;gýgr&quot; (giantess), usually considered a consort to the fiery &quot;jötunn&quot; Surtr, the lord of Muspelheim, but wife of Mimir. Sinmara is attested solely in the poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, where she is mentioned alongside Surtr in one (emended) stanza, and described as keeper of the legendary weapon Lævateinn in a later passage. Assorted theories have been proposed about the etymology of her name, and her connection with other figures in Norse mythology.

==Etymology==

===Nightmare===
The etymology of the name &quot;Sinmara&quot; is obscure. However, the name has been associated with the nightmare/succubus spirit (&quot;mara&quot;) of folklore since Árni Magnússon (Magnæus)&#x27;s &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; (1787-1828). The &quot;-mara&quot; ending is thought cognate with &quot;mara&quot; or &quot;night-mare&quot;. The initial &quot;sin-&quot; element is here identified as meaning &quot;sinew&quot; or rather &quot;nerves&quot;, so that the total phrase comes out as &quot;nervous (or nerve-afflicting) nightmare&quot;. Árni&#x27;s edition also explained Sinmara to be a sort of &quot;night fury&quot; ().

 also embraced the interpretation half-way, stating the name meant &quot;the great [night]mare&quot;, where the &quot;Sin&quot;- meaning great can be compared to Old High German &quot;sinfluth&quot; or &quot;sinvlout&quot; &#x27;great flood&#x27;.

Adolfo Zavaroni and Emilia Reggio suggest the interpretation &quot;Perpetual-incubus&quot;.

It has also been proposed that the &quot;sin-&quot; element may refer to &quot;sindr&quot; (Old Norse &quot;cinders&quot;). This is consistent with the attestation in the poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot; that she is &quot;hin fölva gýgr&quot; (&quot;the pale giantess&quot;, or perhaps &quot;ashes-coloured giantess&quot;). Rudolf Simek, while assessing that &quot;sin&quot; cannot be related to the term &quot;sindr&quot;, states this would equal a &quot;meaningful interpretation in regard to the colour&quot;; he theorizes that a more likely interpretation is &quot;the pale (night-)mare&quot;, noting that this would fit the wife of a fire jötunn.

=== Sinew-maimer ===

Viktor Rydberg proposed that the name &quot;Sinmara&quot; is composed of &quot;sin&quot;, meaning &quot;sinew&quot;, and &quot;mara&quot;, meaning &quot;the one that maims&quot;, noting that &quot;mara&quot; is related to the verb &quot;merja&quot; (citing Guðbrandur Vigfússon&#x27;s dictionary), Rydberg concludes that the name &quot;Sinmara&quot; thus means &quot;the one who maims by doing violence to the sinews,&quot; thus identifying her as Nidhad&#x27;s wife, who orders Völund&#x27;s sinews cut to prevent his escape, in the eddic poem &quot;Völundarkviða&quot;.

==&quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;==

Sinmara is solely attested in the Eddaic poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;. The poem refers to her as a pale giantess (&quot;gýgr&quot;), so she is &quot;probably a giantess&quot;.

The poem &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot; is a bridal quest, in which Svipdagr eventually gains entry to the mansion that houses his would-be bride Menglöð. Svipdagr (under the pseudonym Vindkaldr) poses questions to the watchman Fjölsviðr (&quot;Much Wise&quot;) and gathers intelligence about the mansion. He gleans the fact that the guard-hounds of the mansion can only be distracted by the meat of the rooster Víðófnir. This is where Sinmara figures, as the keeper of Lævateinn, the only weapon capable of slaying the rooster:
--&gt;

That Sinmara will only award the weapon to one who brings her the tail feather of the rooster creates an insurmountable paradox to obtaining it. Fjölsviðr insinuates that a man may succeed in obtaining the weapon Lævateinn if a man carries a certain hard-to-obtain item to Sinmora (here she is referred to as &quot;eir aurglasis&quot; or &quot;the goddess of gold&quot;). Svipdag in turn inquires what treasure it is that would so delight Sinmara (&quot;fǫlva gýgr&quot; or &quot;the giantess pale&quot;). Fjölsviðr then replies Svipdagr must bring the &quot;bright sickle&quot; to Sinmara, and then she will give Lævateinn to Svipdagr:

Sinmara has so far been mentioned twice explicitly, and twice by periphrases. In certain editions and translations, she is mentioned explicitly a third time as a product of emendation (in an earlier strophe than quoted above). Thus in the modified readings of certain editions and in Bellows&#x27; translation, Fjölsviðr names Sinmara and Surtr together, and says that the two are endangered by the rooster Víðópnir that sits atop the tree Mímameiðr:

However the original reading of this same strophe does not give mention of Sinmara:

==Theories==

Henry Adams Bellows comments that Sinmara is &quot;presumably Surt&#x27;s wife&quot;. In the theories of Viktor Rydberg, Sinmara is the wife of Mímir, the mother of Nótt, Böðvildr, &quot;and other night díses&quot;. According to Rydberg, the byname &quot;Sinmara&quot; refers to &quot;Mímir-Niðhad&quot;&#x27;s &quot;queen ordering Völund&#x27;s hamstrings to be cut&quot;.

Hjalmar Falk states that &quot;Sinmara [...] is probably no other than Hel, Loki&#x27;s daughter.&quot; He says that Sinmara is specifically called &quot;hin fölva gýgr&quot; &quot;the pale giantess&quot; in &quot;Fjölsvinnsmál&quot;, just as the classical Roman poet Virgil speaks of the pale Orcus, a god of the underworld in Roman mythology, and that Hel is blue or half blue and half light, like the Roman goddess Proserpina, whom Saxo equates to Hel in his &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. Falk further notes that Sinmara is referred to as &quot;aurglasis Eirr&quot;, which he translates as &quot;the goddess of the gold ring&quot;, and compares Hel&#x27;s being called &quot;Gjallar sunnu gátt&quot; &quot;wearer of the necklace&quot; in stanza 9 of the poem &quot;Forspjallsljóð&quot;. Björn Olsen associates the kenning with &quot;veðurglasir&quot;, a name of Yggdrasill in stanza 24 of the same poem, and translates &quot;aurglasir&quot; as a name for the root system of the world-tree.

<text>Moin, moi or mojn is a Low German, Frisian, High German ( or ), Danish () () greeting from East Frisia, Northern Germany, the eastern and northern Netherlands, Southern Jutland in Denmark and parts of Kashubia in northern Poland. The greeting is also used in Finnish. 

It means &quot;hello&quot; and, in some places, &quot;goodbye&quot; too.

==Usage==

&quot;Moin&quot; is used at all times of day, not just in the morning (see Etymology section below). The reduplicated form &quot;moin moin&quot; is often heard, although some authors claim it is regarded by locals as tourists&#x27; usage.

==Etymology==

Due to the similarity of the words one might think that &quot;moin&quot; derives from various regional pronunciations of (&quot;good morning&quot;), which tend to alter, vocalise, or skip &quot;rg&quot;. However, the word may actually also derive from the Dutch, Frisian, and Low German word , meaning &quot;beautiful&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. Similar forms in Low Saxon are , , . Possibly, as is common in etymology, one origin is correct (from or ) but spread thanks to its oral assimilation with the other term.

The Luxembourgish cognate of the word is , which can mean either &quot;hi&quot; or &quot;morning&quot; ( means &quot;good morning!&quot;). Interestingly, in the area of Germany bordering Luxembourg, it is common to use , instead of .

Unlike , can be used at any time of day. It is semantically equivalent to the Low Saxon (Plattdüütsch) greeting and replaced it in many areas. In Hessen, is used for hello and good bye, but is solely used for good bye. The double form is also used as an all day greeting in for example Flensburg that belonged to Denmark until 1864.
In Finland, a similar greeting () is used for &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; in the Finnish language. It may have been borrowed from German in the 19th century. The earliest records of the word occur in Southeast Finland, which had strong connection through Viipuri to partially German-speaking Estonia and Latvia. However, is used as a good bye, similarly to &quot;bye bye&quot; in English, even with a similar intonation. Both are particularly typical of Southwestern Finnish, but through internal migration spread to the capital and with the help of TV to the rest of the language area. &#x27;s use is identical to that of : diminutive forms and , and duplication as a good bye.

 is found in some parts of Finland and has also been used in the same way as . It is theorised that it comes from Tampere due to its large number of foreign workers and like has been borrowed from and abbreviated.

 is also used in Dutch Low Saxon dialects in the eastern part of the provinces Groningen and Drenthe.

<text>A pentatonic scale is a musical scale with five notes per octave, in contrast to heptatonic scales, which have seven notes per octave (such as the major scale and minor scale).

Pentatonic scales were developed independently by many ancient civilizations and are still used in various musical styles to this day. As Leonard Bernstein put it: &quot;the universality of this scale is so well known that I&#x27;m sure you could give me examples of it, from all corners of the earth, as from Scotland, or from China, or from Africa, and from American Indian cultures, from East Indian cultures, from Central and South America, Australia, Finland ...now, that is a true musico-linguistic universal.&quot; There are two types of pentatonic scales: those with semitones (hemitonic) and those without (anhemitonic).

== Types ==

=== Hemitonic and anhemitonic ===


Musicology commonly classifies pentatonic scales as either &quot;hemitonic&quot; or &quot;anhemitonic&quot;. Hemitonic scales contain one or more semitones and anhemitonic scales do not contain semitones. (For example, in Japanese music the anhemitonic &quot;yo&quot; scale is contrasted with the hemitonic &quot;in&quot; scale.) Hemitonic pentatonic scales are also called &quot;ditonic scales&quot;, because the largest interval in them is the ditone (e.g., in the scale C–E–F–G–B–C, the interval found between C–E and G–B). (This should not be confused with the identical term also used by musicologists to describe a scale including only two notes.)

=== Major pentatonic scale ===
Anhemitonic pentatonic scales can be constructed in many ways. The major pentatonic scale may be thought of as a gapped or incomplete major scale, using scale tones 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the major scale. One construction takes five consecutive pitches from the circle of fifths; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E. Rearranging the pitches to fit into one octave creates the major pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, A.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \time 5/4
 c d e g a c
&lt;/score&gt;
Another construction works backward: It omits two pitches from a diatonic scale. If one were to begin with a C major scale, for example, one might omit the fourth and the seventh scale degrees, F and B. The remaining notes then make up the major pentatonic scale: C, D, E, G, and A.

Omitting the third and seventh degrees of the C major scale obtains the notes for another transpositionally equivalent anhemitonic pentatonic scale: F, G, A, C, D. Omitting the first and fourth degrees of the C major scale gives a third anhemitonic pentatonic scale: G, A, B, D, E.

The black keys on a piano keyboard comprise a G-flat (or equivalently, F-sharp) major pentatonic scale: G-flat, A-flat, B-flat, D-flat, and E-flat, which is exploited in Chopin&#x27;s black key étude.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&quot; {
 \time 5/4
 ges aes bes des ees ges

&lt;/score&gt;

=== Minor pentatonic scale ===
Although various hemitonic pentatonic scales might be called &quot;minor&quot;, the term is most commonly applied to the relative minor pentatonic derived from the major pentatonic, using scale tones 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the natural minor scale. (It may also be considered a gapped blues scale.) The C minor pentatonic scale, the relative minor of the E-flat pentatonic scale, is C, E-flat, F, G, B-flat. The A minor pentatonic, the relative minor of C pentatonic, comprises the same tones as the C major pentatonic, starting on A, giving A, C, D, E, G. This minor pentatonic contains all three tones of an A minor triad.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&quot; {
 \time 5/4
 a4 c d e g | a

&lt;/score&gt;

The standard tuning of a guitar uses the notes of an E minor pentatonic scale: E–A–D–G–B–E, contributing to its frequency in popular music. Stevie Wonder employed the minor pentatonic for the funky clavinet riff on the track &quot;Superstition&quot; (1972).

=== Japanese scale ===
The Japanese mode is based on the Phrygian mode, but uses scale tones 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 instead of scale tones 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #&#x27;stencil = ##f
\relative c&#x27; {
 \time 5/4
 e f a b c | e

&lt;/score&gt;

== Modes of the pentatonic scale ==

The pentatonic scale (containing notes C, D, E, G and A) has five modes, which are derived by treating a different note as the tonic:

Ricker assigned the major pentatonic scale mode I while Gilchrist assigned it mode III.

=== Relationship to diatonic modes ===
Each mode of the pentatonic scale (containing notes C, D, E, G and A) can be thought of as the five scale degrees shared by three different diatonic modes with the two remaining scale degrees removed:


=== Intervals from tonic ===

Each mode of the pentatonic scale (containing notes C, D, E, G and A) features different intervals of notes from the tonic according to the table below. Note the omission of the semitones above (m2) and below (M7) the tonic as well as the tritone (TT).


== Tuning ==
=== Pythagorean tuning ===

Ben Johnston gives the following Pythagorean tuning for the minor pentatonic scale:

Naturals in that table are not the alphabetic series A to G without sharps and flats: Naturals are reciprocals of terms in the Harmonic series (mathematics), which are in practice multiples of a fundamental frequency. This may be derived by proceeding with the principle that historically gives the Pythagorean diatonic and chromatic scales, stacking perfect fifths with 3:2 frequency proportions (C–G–D–A–E). Considering the anhemitonic scale as a subset of a just diatonic scale, it is tuned thus: 20:24:27:30:36 (A–C–D–E–G = ––––).

=== Just intonation ===

(A minor seventh can be 7:4, 16:9, or 9:5; a major sixth can be 27:16 or 5:3. Both were chosen to minimize ratio parts.)

=== Other ===
Assigning precise frequency proportions to the pentatonic scales of most cultures is problematic as tuning may be variable.
For example, the slendro anhemitonic scale and its modes of Java and Bali are said to approach, very roughly, an equally-tempered five-note scale, but their tunings vary dramatically from gamelan to gamelan.

Composer Lou Harrison has been one of the most recent proponents and developers of new pentatonic scales based on historical models. Harrison and William Colvig tuned the slendro scale of the gamelan Si Betty to overtones 16:19:21:24:28 (––––). They tuned the Mills gamelan so that the intervals between scale steps are 8:7–7:6–9:8–8:7–7:6 (––––– = 42:48:56:63:72)

== Use of pentatonic scales ==
Pentatonic scales occur in many musical traditions:

* Indian classical music, both Hindustani and Carnatic traditions
* Ancient Tamil music, see the Section &quot;Evolution of panns&quot;.
* Peruvian Chicha cumbia
* Indigenous ethnic folk music of Assam
* Sudanese Music
* Celtic folk music
* English folk music
* German folk music
* Nordic folk music
* Hungarian folk music
* Croatian folk music
* Berber music
* West African music
* African-American spirituals
* Gospel music
* Bluegrass music
* American folk music
* Music of Ethiopia
* Jazz
* Blues
* Rock music
* Sami joik singing
* Children&#x27;s song
* The music of ancient Greece
** Greek traditional music and polyphonic songs from Epirus in northwest Greece
* Music of southern Albania
* Folk songs of peoples of the Middle Volga region (such as the Mari, the Chuvash and Tatars)
* The tuning of the Ethiopian krar and the Indonesian gamelan
* Philippine kulintang
* Native American music, especially in highland South America (the Quechua and Aymara), as well as among the North American Indians of the Pacific Northwest
* Most Turkic, Mongolic and Tungusic music of Siberia and the Asiatic steppe is written in the pentatonic scale
* Melodies of China, Korea, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Malaysia, Japan, and Vietnam (including the folk music of these countries)
** Traditional Japanese court music
** Shōmyō chanting
* Andean music
* Afro-Caribbean music
* Polish highlanders from the Tatra Mountains
=== In classical music ===
Examples of its use include:

Beethoven, Quartet in F major, Op. 135, finale: 

Chopin&#x27;s Etude in G-flat major, Op. 10, No. 5, the &quot;Black Key&quot; etude, in the major pentatonic. 

Western Impressionistic composers such as French composer Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel used the pentatonic scale extensively in their works.

Giacomo Puccini used pentatonic scales in his operas &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; and &quot;Turandot&quot; to imitate east Asian musical styles. Puccini also used whole-tone scales in the former to evoke similar ideas.

=== Indian ragas ===
Indian classical music has hundreds of ragas, of which many are pentatonic. Examples include Raag Abhogi Kanada (C, D, E-flat, F, A), Raag Bhupali (C, D, E, G, A), Raag Bairagi (C, D-flat, F, G, B-flat), Raag Chandrakauns (C, E-flat, F, A-flat, B), Raag Dhani (C, E-flat, F, G, B-flat), Raag Durga (C, D, F, G, A), Raag Gunakari (C, D-flat, F, G, A-flat), Raag Hamsadhwani (C, D, E, G, B), Raag Hindol (C, E, F#, A, B), Raag Kalavati (C, E, G, A, B-flat), Raag Katyayani (C, D, E-flat, G, A-flat), Raag Malkauns (C, E-flat, F, A-flat, B-flat), Raag Megh (C, D, F, G, B-flat), Raag Shivaranjani (C, D, E-flat, G, A), Raag Shuddha Sarang (C, D, F#, G, B), Raag Tilang (C, E, F, G, B), Raag Vibhas (C, D-flat, E, G, A-flat), Raag Vrindavani Sarang (C, D, F, G, B), and others.

=== Further pentatonic musical traditions ===

The major pentatonic scale is the basic scale of the music of China and the music of Mongolia as well as many Southeast Asian musical traditions such as that of the Karen people as well as the indigenous Assamese ethnic groups. The pentatonic scale predominates most Eastern countries as opposed to Western countries where the heptatonic scale is more commonly used. The fundamental tones (without &quot;meri&quot; or &quot;kari&quot; techniques) rendered by the five holes of the Japanese shakuhachi flute play a minor pentatonic scale. The yo scale used in Japanese shomyo Buddhist chants and gagaku imperial court music is an anhemitonic pentatonic scale shown below, which is the fourth mode of the major pentatonic scale.

=== Javanese ===

In Javanese gamelan music, the slendro scale has five tones, of which four are emphasized in classical music. Another scale, pelog, has seven tones, and is generally played using one of three five-tone subsets known as pathet, in which certain notes are avoided while others are emphasized.

===Somali===
Somali music uses a distinct modal system that is pentatonic, with characteristically long intervals between some notes. As with many other aspects of Somali culture and tradition, tastes in music and lyrics are strongly linked with those in nearby Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti and Sudan.

=== Scottish ===
In Scottish music, the pentatonic scale is very common. Seumas MacNeill suggests that the Great Highland bagpipe scale with its augmented fourth and diminished seventh is &quot;a device to produce as many pentatonic scales as possible from its nine notes&quot; (although these two features are not in the same scale). Roderick Cannon explains these pentatonic scales and their use in more detail, both in Piobaireachd and light music. It also features in Irish traditional music, either purely or almost so. The minor pentatonic is used in Appalachian folk music. Blackfoot music most often uses anhemitonic tetratonic or pentatonic scales.

=== Andean ===

In Andean music, the pentatonic scale is used substantially minor, sometimes major, and seldom &quot;in&quot; scale. In the most ancient genres of Andean music being performed without string instruments (only with winds and percussion), pentatonic melody is often led with parallel fifths and fourths, so formally this music is hexatonic.

=== Jazz ===

Jazz music commonly uses both the major and the minor pentatonic scales. Pentatonic scales are useful for improvisers in modern jazz, pop, and rock contexts because they work well over several chords diatonic to the same key, often better than the parent scale. For example, the blues scale is predominantly derived from the minor pentatonic scale, a very popular scale for improvisation in the realms of blues and rock alike. For instance, over a C major triad (C, E, G) in the key of C major, the note F can be perceived as dissonant as it is a half step above the major third (E) of the chord. It is for this reason commonly avoided. Using the major pentatonic scale is an easy way out of this problem. The scale tones 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 (from the major pentatonic) are either major triad tones (1, 3, 5) or common consonant extensions (2, 6) of major triads. For the corresponding relative minor pentatonic, scale tones 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 work the same way, either as minor triad tones (1, 3, 5) or as common extensions (4, 7), as they all avoid being a half step from a chord tone.

=== Other ===
U.S. military cadences, or &quot;jodies&quot;, which keep soldiers in step while marching or running, also typically use pentatonic scales.

Hymns and other religious music sometimes use the pentatonic scale; for example, the melody of the hymn &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;

The common pentatonic major and minor scales (C-D-E-G-A and C-E-F-G-B, respectively) are useful in modal composing, as both scales allow a melody to be modally ambiguous between their respective major (Ionian, Lydian, Mixolydian) and minor (Aeolian, Phrygian, Dorian) modes (Locrian excluded). With either modal or non-modal writing, however, the &quot;harmonization&quot; of a pentatonic melody does not necessarily have to be derived from only the pentatonic pitches.

Most Tuareg songs are pentatonic, as is most other music from the Sahel and Sudan regions.

== Role in education ==
The pentatonic scale plays a significant role in music education, particularly in Orff-based, Kodály-based, and Waldorf methodologies at the primary or elementary level.

The Orff system places a heavy emphasis on developing creativity through improvisation in children, largely through use of the pentatonic scale. Orff instruments, such as xylophones, bells and other metallophones, use wooden bars, metal bars or bells, which can be removed by the teacher, leaving only those corresponding to the pentatonic scale, which Carl Orff himself believed to be children&#x27;s native tonality.

Children begin improvising using only these bars, and over time, more bars are added at the teacher&#x27;s discretion until the complete diatonic scale is being used. Orff believed that the use of the pentatonic scale at such a young age was appropriate to the development of each child, since the nature of the scale meant that it was impossible for the child to make any real harmonic mistakes.

In Waldorf education, pentatonic music is considered to be appropriate for young children due to its simplicity and unselfconscious openness of expression. Pentatonic music centered on intervals of the fifth is often sung and played in early childhood; progressively smaller intervals are emphasized within primarily pentatonic as children progress through the early school years. At around nine years of age the music begins to center on first folk music using a six-tone scale, and then the modern diatonic scales, with the goal of reflecting the children&#x27;s developmental progress in their musical experience. Pentatonic instruments used include lyres, pentatonic flutes, and tone bars; special instruments have been designed and built for the Waldorf curriculum.

<text>A metronome () is a device that produces an audible click or other sound at a uniform interval that can be set by the user, typically in beats per minute (BPM). Metronomes may also include synchronized visual motion, such as a swinging pendulum or a blinking light. Musicians—and others including dancers, athletes, and health professionals—often practise with a metronome to improve their timing, especially the ability to maintain a steady tempo with a regular beat or pulse. Composers and conductors often use numerical metronome markings to communicate their preferred tempos to musicians preparing for a performance.

A type of metronome was among the inventions of Andalusian polymath Abbas ibn Firnas (810–887). In 1815, German inventor Johann Maelzel patented a mechanical, wind-up metronome as a tool for musicians, under the title &quot;Instrument/Machine for the Improvement of all Musical Performance, called Metronome&quot;. In the 20th century, electronic metronomes and software metronomes were invented.

When interpreting emotion and other qualities in music, performers seldom play exactly on every beat. In a musically expressive performance, the pulse generally does not align with the clicks of a metronome. This has led some musicians to criticize use of a metronome, because &quot;musical time is replaced by clock time&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;metronome&quot; first appeared in English in Maelzel&#x27;s 1815 patent application, and is Greek in origin, derived from &quot;metron—&quot;&quot;measure&quot; and &quot;nomos—&quot;&quot;regulation, law&quot;. The London patent refers to the machine as &quot;a metronome or musical time-keeper&quot;.

==History and types==
===Mechanical metronomes===

Historical credit for the mechanical metronome is spread across Spanish, Italian, French, Dutch and German contributors.

According to historian Lynn Townsend White Jr., the Andalusian inventor Abbas Ibn Firnas created &quot;some sort of metronome&quot; in the 9th century. Galileo Galilei studied and discovered key concepts involving the pendulum in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, famously inspired by a steadily swaying chandelier in Pisa Cathedral. In 1696, musician Étienne Loulié built a pendulum-based &quot;chronomètre&quot;, consisting of a lead weight hanging from an adjustable string alongside a vertical ruler. However, his design produced no sound, and did not have an escapement mechanism to keep the pendulum in motion. To get the correct tempo with this type of visual device, a musician would need to watch the pendulum as if watching a conductor&#x27;s baton.

The more-familiar mechanical musical chronometre was invented by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel in Amsterdam in 1814, based on a spring-powered, inverted pendulum rod with fixed and adjustable weights to achieve compactness. Through questionable practice, Johann Maelzel, incorporating Winkel&#x27;s ideas, added a numerical scale, called it a metronome, and started mass-manufacturing the pyramid-shaped device in 1816 under his own name: &quot;Maelzel&#x27;s Metronome.&quot; The original text of Maelzel&#x27;s patent in England (1815) can be downloaded.

Maelzel&#x27;s mechanical metronome uses an adjustable weight on an inverted pendulum rod to control tempo. The weight slides up the pendulum rod to decrease tempo, or down to increase tempo. (This mechanism is also called a double-weighted pendulum, because there is a second, fixed weight on the other side of the pendulum pivot, inside the metronome case.) The pendulum swings back and forth in tempo, while a mechanism inside the metronome produces a clicking sound with each oscillation. A mechanical metronome does not need an electric battery, but runs from a spring-wound clockwork escapement. For uniform beats, the metronome should be placed on a hard, level, unmoving surface, and away from any strong magnets. Small variations in pendulum speed can also result from differences in temperature, air pressure, or gravity.

Since Maelzel&#x27;s era, musical tempo is almost always measured in beats per minute (BPM). Metronomes often display both BPM numbers and traditional tempo markings, which are written words conveying a range of tempos and an associated character. For example, the Italian term &quot;Vivace&quot; indicates a tempo typically between 156 and 176 BPM, but it also communicates that the music should be played with a lively character.

A mechanical metronome&#x27;s tempo is usually adjustable from 40 to 208 BPM. The most-common arrangement of tempos on a Maelzel metronome begins with 40 beats per minute
and increases by 2 BPM: 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60,
then by 3 BPM: 63 66 69 72,
then by 4 BPM: 76 80 84 88 92 96 100 104 108 112 116 120,
then by 6 BPM: 126 132 138 144,
then by 8 BPM: 152 160 168 176 184 192 200 208.
Some modern metronomes allow adjustment to more-precise tempos (e.g., increasing 120 to 121), but such a difference is hardly perceptible.

===Electromechanical metronomes===

Electromechanical metronomes were invented by Frederick Franz in the US and patented in 1953. Instead of a clockwork or a quartz crystal, a plug-in electric motor operates the mechanism. Most use a mechanical variable-speed drive combination with a momentary switch and a cam wheel to time the beats. A frequent feature is an embedded neon lamp that flashes in time with the beat. Franz and Yamaha were common manufacturers in the 1960s and 1970s; a popular model was the Franz LB4.

After the fall of the Soviet Bloc in 1991, the electromechanical Prague Metronome was installed as a silent kinetic sculpture overlooking the city, an inverted pendulum symbolizing the passage of time. It may still be the world&#x27;s largest metronome, although Geneva (since 1972) and Gdańsk (since 2016) each have a larger pendulum clock.

===Electronic metronomes===

Most modern metronomes are electronic and use a battery-powered quartz crystal to maintain accuracy in any position, comparable to wristwatches since the 1980s. Electronic metronomes are considerably smaller and more rugged than the earlier types. The simplest electronic metronomes have dials or buttons to control the tempo and volume. Some also produce or measure tuning notes, usually around the range of A440 (440 hertz). Sophisticated metronomes can produce two or more distinct sounds. Tones can differ in pitch, volume and/or timbre to distinguish downbeats from other beats, as well as compound and complex time signatures. Many electronic musical keyboards have built-in metronome functions with selectable rhythm patterns.

===Software metronomes===

21st-century digital software metronomes run either as standalone applications on computers and smartphones, or in music sequencing and audio multitrack software packages. In recording studio applications, such as film scoring, a software metronome may provide a click track to synchronize musicians.

Portable MP3 players including iPods can play pre-recorded MP3 metronome click tracks, which can use different sounds and samples instead of the usual metronome click or beep. Users of smartphones can install a wide range of metronome applications. The Google search engine includes an interactive metronome that can play between 40 and 218 BPM. Either method avoids the need to bring a physical metronome to lessons or practice sessions.

==Usage==
===Tempo indication===
In written musical scores since the early 1800s, composers and conductors (or editors) often indicate their preferred tempos using BPM metronome speeds, with or without descriptive tempo markings, to help musicians prepare for a performance. Even works that do not require a strictly constant tempo, such as musical passages with rubato, sometimes provide BPM markings to indicate the general tempo. Another mark that denotes tempo is M.M. (or MM), for Maelzel&#x27;s Metronome. The notation M.M. is usually followed by a note value and a number that indicates the tempo, as in .

Ludwig van Beethoven, a personal acquaintance of Maelzel, became the first notable composer to indicate specific metronome markings in his music. This was done in December 1815, with the corrected copy of the score of the Cantata op. 112 containing Beethoven&#x27;s first metronome mark.

===Pacing tool===
Musicians often practise with metronomes to develop and maintain a sense of timing and tempo. Metronomes are also used as a training tool to achieve a desired performance speed—not only by musicians, but also by dancers, runners, swimmers, and others.

Specific uses include learning to maintain tempos and beats consistently. For example, a musician fighting a tendency to speed up might practise a phrase repeatedly while slightly slowing the BPM setting each time, to play more steadily. A musician or athlete seeking to improve technical proficiency might set the metronome to gradually higher speeds until the desired tempo is achieved. This also helps to expose unintentional slowdowns due to technical challenges or fatigue. Additionally, recording musicians use click tracks from metronomes to help audio engineers synchronize audio tracks.

In health care, metronomes can be used to maintain the desired pacing in various physiological tests and procedures. For example, CPR chest compressions are significantly more likely to follow the recommended 100–120 BPM when a hospital emergency room uses an audible metronome, or when rescuers in non-hospital settings can remember a suitably paced song as a &quot;mental metronome&quot;.

====Metronome technique====
&quot;Metronome technique&quot; is extensive and has been the subject of several books for musicians. The &quot;intuitive&quot; approach is simply to practise a full musical work, in time with a metronome clicking the downbeats. With more-advanced metronome technique, musicians practise separate exercises to strengthen their sense of rhythm, tempo, and musical time, while also cultivating flexibility and expression.

The basic skill required is the ability to play &quot;in the pocket&quot;—that is, precisely on the click of the metronome, in a relaxed fashion. It helps musicians to develop a strong sense of time, at intervals corresponding to fractions of a second. One challenge with this approach, especially for pianists and percussionists, is the metronome click seeming to vanish (or at least be heard less distinctly) when one hits the click exactly. Musicians who attempt to play in the pocket with a metronome without established technique may find that it introduces tension and effort into their performance. To address these difficulties, musicians may first learn to play consistently behind or ahead of the click whenever they want to. As a result, they develop a clear sense of &quot;where the click is&quot; and can train to hit the click as well.
Much of modern metronome technique aims to resolve timing problems without creating overdependence on the metronome. Typical exercises are to practise maintaining a tempo while the metronome is muted for progressively longer periods of time, or to practise with displaced clicks (offset from the usual downbeats) or polyrhythms against the metronome.

To help build rhythmic flexibility and musical expression in performances, preparatory exercises with the metronome often incorporate a fluid sense of timing. For example, musicians may practise drifting gradually from one beat to the next, or alternately pulling behind and pushing ahead of the click. As author/drummer Mac Santiago wrote: &quot;The ability to hear the pulse and yet accelerate or decelerate slightly is a great way to incorporate human feeling into a musical performance. ... This also works for the actions of ritardando and accelerando, as they are relative to a steady pulse and are best performed gradually rather than in sudden shifts.&quot;

===Percussion instrument===
Perhaps the most famous, and most direct, use of the metronome as an unconventional musical instrument is György Ligeti&#x27;s composition, &quot;Poème Symphonique for 100 metronomes&quot; (1962). Two years earlier, Toshi Ichiyanagi had written &quot;Music for Electric Metronomes&quot; (1960). Maurice Ravel used three metronomes at different speeds for the opening of his opera about a clockmaker, &quot;L&#x27;heure espagnole&quot; (1911).

The clicking sounds of mechanical metronomes have sometimes been used to provide a soft rhythm track without using any of the usual percussion instruments. Paul McCartney did this on &quot;Distractions&quot; (&quot;Flowers in the Dirt&quot;, 1989). Following the metronome, McCartney performed a rhythm track by hitting various parts of his body. Also, in Ennio Morricone&#x27;s theme &quot;Farewell to Cheyenne&quot; (featured in the film &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West&quot;, 1968), the steady clip-clop beat is provided by the deliberately distorted and slowed-down sound of a mechanical metronome.

Five metronomes begin Philip Miller&#x27;s musical score to William Kentridge&#x27;s video installation &quot;The Refusal of Time&quot; (2012).

==Reception==
=== Positive views ===
The metronome is usually viewed positively by performers, teachers, conservatories, and musicologists (who spend considerable time analysing metronome markings). It is considered an excellent practice tool because of its steady beat, being &quot;mathematically perfect and categorically correct&quot;. This removes guesswork and aids musicians in various ways, including keeping tempos, countering tendencies to slow down or speed up unintentionally, monitoring technical progress, and increasing evenness and accuracy, especially in rapid passages. Metronomes are thus commonly used at all skill levels, from beginners to professional musicians, and are often recommended to music students without reservation. As commentator/violist Miles Hoffman wrote in 1997: &quot;Most music teachers consider the metronome indispensable, and most professional musicians, in fact, continue to practice with a metronome throughout their careers.&quot; Some musicians took this view almost as soon as the metronome was invented in the early 19th century. The online book &quot;Metronome Techniques&quot; includes a &quot;Potpourri&quot; chapter with dozens of quotations from music teachers in favour of metronome practice.

===Stricter rhythm in modern performance practice===
The metronome has become very important in performance practice, and &quot;largely unchallenged in musical pedagogy or scholarship since the 20th century&quot;. In the 19th century, the metronome was usually not used for ticking all through a piece, but only to check the tempo and then set it aside. This is in contrast with many musicians today, who practise with the metronome in the background for the entirety of a piece of music, generally leading to steadier performances.

Oboist/musicologist Bruce Haynes described the role of the metronome in modern performance style in detail in his book &quot;The End of Early Music&quot;. He emphasized that modern style is much more rhythmically rigid, compared with the effusive rubato and bluster characteristic of expressive 19th-century Romantic music. Because of this, musicologist and critic Richard Taruskin called Modernism &quot;refuge in order and precision, hostility to subjectivity, to the vagaries of personality&quot;. These qualities gave rise to the term &quot;metronomic&quot;, which music critics use to describe performances with an unyielding tempo, a mechanical rhythmic approach, and equal stress to all subintervals; violinist Sol Babitz considered it &quot;sewing machine&quot; style with limited flexibility. Some writers have drawn parallels with a modern technological society that is ordered by the clock.

===Criticisms===
Unlike approximate and descriptive tempo markings, a published metronome speed indicates a highly specific tempo that cannot adapt to variations in musical aesthetics, concert hall acoustics, or the instruments themselves. This is one reason why composers including Felix Mendelssohn and Richard Wagner have criticized the publication of metronome marks. As Johannes Brahms once commented regarding his &quot;German Requiem&quot;: &quot;I think here as well as with all other music, the metronome is of no value. As far at least as my experience goes, everybody has, sooner or later, withdrawn his metronome marks.&quot;

A metronome only provides a fixed, continuous beat. Therefore, metronome markings on sheet music provide a reference, but cannot accurately communicate the pulse, swing, or groove of music. The pulse is often irregular, e.g., in accelerando, rallentando, or expressive musical phrasing such as rubato. Even such highly rhythmical musical forms as samba, if performed in a culturally authentic style consistent with recordings by early practitioners, cannot be captured with the beats of a metronome. Performances that are unfailingly regular rhythmically might be criticized as being &quot;metronomic&quot;, lacking the characteristic swing of the genre.

Some have argued that &quot;the metronome has no real musical value&quot;, hurting rather than helping musicians&#x27; sense of rhythm. The use of a metronome has been compared to the difference between mechanically-aided and freehand drawing, in that the output with a metronome is said to be rigid and hampering creativity. American composer and critic Daniel Gregory Mason wrote that the use of the metronome is &quot;dangerous&quot; because it leads musicians to play by the measure or beat instead of the phrase, at the expense of liveliness, instinct, and rhythmical energy, &quot;a dead body in place of the living musical organism&quot;. Even proponents of the metronome have warned that its strict speed and repetition can hinder internal rhythm and musicality when &quot;over-used&quot;.

==Alternatives to metronome use==
If a musician decides not to use a metronome, other methods are required to deal with timing and tempo glitches, rushing and dragging. These strategies may also be combined with metronome technique as a complementary approach.

Humans rely on an innate sense of rhythm to perform ordinary activities such as walking, hammering nails or chopping vegetables. Even speech and thought have a rhythm of sorts. Author/drummer Andrew C. Lewis recommends working to bring these everyday rhythms into music:

Until the 19th century in Europe, people used to sing as they worked, in time to the rhythms of their daily tasks. In many parts of the world today, especially tribal areas, people still sing frequently and spontaneously as they engage in daily activities. Even without singing, instrumentalists can strengthen their innate sense of pulse using quieter bodily rhythms, such as breathing, walking, foot tapping, or other activities. (Likewise, listeners often adjust these movements subconsciously when hearing rhythmic music.) Musicians can deal with timing and tempo glitches by learning to &quot;hear an ideal performance in their mind&quot; first, and by listening carefully to recordings of themselves and others.

&quot;Notes inégales&quot; (unequal notes) are a common feature of French Baroque music, in which subdivided pairs of notes are written with equal duration but performed with a long/short dotted or triplet rhythm. Usually, these pairs are played with steady downbeats and the same amount of swing throughout, like modern jazz. Less commonly, the unequal rhythms are more extensive and irregular, like the constantly shifting rhythms of speech. In this view, rhythms that are subtly unsynchronized and uneven throughout can help to keep the music alive and interesting, and prevent any feeling of sameness and boredom. Musicians may practise organizing notes and phrases into &quot;musical gestures&quot;, patterns of motions that come naturally, rather than metronomically strict measures. Performers also may slightly delay or extend an important note of a musical phrase, to build a sense of anticipation or emphasis. This freer approach is a minority interpretation of &quot;notes inégales&quot; for early music, but noteworthy because of its perspective on musical time and rhythm, and its relevance to musicians practising to create an emotionally engaging experience for listeners.

<text>Improvisation, often shortened to improv, is the activity of making or doing something not planned beforehand, using whatever can be found. The origin of the word itself is in the Latin &quot;improvisus&quot;, which literally means un-foreseen. Improvisation in the performing arts is a very spontaneous performance without specific or scripted preparation. The skills of improvisation can apply to many different faculties across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines; see Applied improvisation.

==Skills and techniques==

The skills of improvisation can apply to many different abilities or forms of communication and expression across all artistic, scientific, physical, cognitive, academic, and non-academic disciplines. For example, improvisation can make a significant contribution in music, dance, cooking, presenting a speech, sales, personal or romantic relationships, sports, flower arranging, martial arts, psychotherapy, and much more.

Techniques of improvisation are widely used in training for performing arts or entertainment; for example, music, theatre and dance. To &quot;extemporize&quot; or &quot;ad lib&quot; is basically the same as improvising. Colloquial terms such as &quot;playing by ear&quot;, &quot;take it as it comes&quot;, and &quot;making it up as [one] goes along&quot; are all used to describe improvisation.

The simple act of speaking requires a good deal of improvisation because the mind is addressing its own thought and creating its unrehearsed delivery in words, sounds and gestures, forming unpredictable statements that further feed the thought process (the performer as the listener), creating an enriched process that is not unlike instantaneous composition with a given set or repertoire of elements.

Where the improvisation is intended to solve a problem on a temporary basis, the &quot;proper&quot; solution being unavailable at the time, it may be known as a &quot;stop-gap&quot;. This applies to the field of engineering. Another improvisational, group problem-solving technique being used in organizations of all kinds is &quot;brainstorming&quot;, in which any and all ideas that a group member may have are permitted and encouraged to be expressed, regardless of actual practicality. As in all improvisation, the process of brainstorming opens up the minds of the people involved to new, unexpected and possibly useful ideas. The colloquial term for this is &quot;thinking outside the box.&quot;

==Arts and entertainment==
===Performing arts===

Improvisation can be thought of as an &quot;on the spot&quot; or &quot;off the cuff&quot; spontaneous moment of sudden inventiveness that can just come to mind, body and spirit as an inspiration. Viola Spolin created theater games as a method of training improvisational acting. Her son, Paul Sills popularized improvisational theater, or IMPROV, by using Spolin&#x27;s techniques to train The Second City in Chicago, the first totally improvisational theater company in the US. However, Improvisation in any life or art form can occur more often if it is practiced as a way of encouraging creative behavior. That practice includes learning to use one&#x27;s intuition, as well as learning a technical understanding of the necessary skills and concerns within the domain in which one is improvising. This can be when an individual or group is acting, dancing, singing, playing musical instruments, talking, creating artworks, problem-solving, or reacting in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one&#x27;s immediate environment and inner feelings. This can result in the invention of new thought patterns, new practices, new structures or symbols, and/or new ways to act.

Improvisation was originally rarely used on dramatic television. A major exception was the situation comedy &quot;Mork &amp; Mindy&quot; where star Robin Williams was allotted specific sections in each episode where he was allowed to perform freely.

====Music====

Musical improvisation is usually defined as the spontaneous performance of music without previous preparation or any written notes. In other words, the art of improvisation can be understood as composing music &quot;on the fly&quot;. There have been experiments by Charles Limb, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, that show the brain activity during musical improvisation. Limb showed increased activity in the medial prefrontal cortex, which is an area associated with an increase in self-expression. Further, there was decreased activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, which is an area associated with self-monitoring. This change in activity is thought to reduce the inhibitions that normally prevent individuals from taking risks and improvising.

Improvisation can take place as a solo performance, or interdependently in an ensemble with other players. When done well, it often elicits gratifying emotional responses from the audience. One notable improvisational pianist is Franz Liszt. The origins of Liszt&#x27;s improvisation in an earlier tradition of playing variations on a theme were mastered and epitomized by Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Ludwig van Beethoven.

Notable improvisational musicians from the modern era include Keith Jarrett, an improvisational jazz pianist and multi-instrumentalist who has performed many improvised concerts all over the world; W. A. Mathieu a.k.a. William Allaudin Mathieu, the musical director for The Second City in Chicago, the first ongoing improvisational theatre troupe in the United States, and later musical director for another improv theatre, The Committee, an offshoot of The Second City in San Francisco; Derek Bailey, an improvisational guitarist and writer of Improvisation: Its Nature and Practice; Evan Parker; British saxophone player, the iconnical pianists Fred van Hove (Be) and Misha Mengelberg (NL) and more recently the Belgian Seppe Gebruers who improvise with two pianos tuned a quartertone apart.

Improvised freestyle rap is commonly practiced as a part of rappers&#x27; creative processes, as a &quot;finished product&quot; for release on recordings (when the improvisation is judged good enough), as a spiritual event, as a means of verbal combat in battle rap, and, simply, for fun. As mentioned above, studies have suggested that improvisation allows a musician to relax the control filters in their mind during this exercise. It often incorporates insults similar to those in the African-American game The Dozens, and complex rhythmic and sometimes melodic forms comparable to those heard in jazz improvisation.

In the realm of silent film music, there are a small number of musicians whose work has been recognized as exceptional by critics, scholars and audiences alike; these include Neil Brand and John Sweeney, among others who are all performers at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy. Their performances must match the style and pacing of those films which they accompany and the knowledge of a wide range of musical styles is required, as well as the stamina to play for films which occasionally run more than three hours, without a pause.

====Theatre====

Improvisation, in theatre, is the playing of dramatic scenes without written dialogue and with minimal or no predetermined dramatic activity. The method has been used for different purposes in theatrical history.

====Comedy====
Improvisational comedy is a theatre art performed throughout the world and has had an on-again, off-again status throughout history.

Some of the more famous improv theatres and training centers in the world include: i.O. (formerly ImprovOlympic) in Chicago and Los Angeles, The Second City in Chicago and Toronto, The Players Workshop in Chicago, National Comedy Theatre in San Diego, New York and Phoenix, Upright Citizens Brigade, the Peoples Improv Theater, the Magnet Theater in New York, The Groundlings in Los Angeles, BATS Improv (Bay Area Theatre Sports) in San Francisco, Wing-It Productions in Seattle, Philly Improv Theater in Philadelphia, Brave New Workshop in Minneapolis, ComedySportz in Milwaukee, Theatresports in Calgary and Improv Comedy Copenhagen.

There are also many well known university improv teams, including Theatre Strike Force at the University of Florida, Gigglepants at the University of Texas at Austin, and Erasable Inc. at the University of Maryland. Improvisation found a home at universities. The origins of the Second City was the Compass Players, an offshoot of theatre programs at the University of Chicago in the 1950s. Later, once improv had been established as an art form, improv groups sprung up on college campuses, starting in the 1980s where crowds were easy to find and teams could perform frequently. Now an improv group is a common staple of college extra curricular activities.

Notable pioneers in the field of improvisation, comedic or otherwise, include Mike Myers, Neil Mullarkey, Paul Merton, Stephen Fry, John Sessions, Josie Lawrence, Viola Spolin, Paul Sills, David Shepherd, Del Close, Josephine Forsberg, Gary Austin, Martin de Maat, and Keith Johnstone. Notable performers include: Paul Merton, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, Robert Townsend, Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, Ross Noble, Eddie Izzard, Tony Slattery, Mike McShane, Sandi Toksvig, Wayne Brady, Jonathan Winters, T. J. Jagodowski, Robin Williams, Conan O&#x27;Brien and David Pasquesi.

====Dance====
Dance improvisation as a choreographic tool: Improvisation is used as a choreographic tool in dance composition. Experimenting with the concepts of shape, space, time, and energy while moving without inhibition or cognitive thinking can create unique and innovative movement designs, spatial configuration, dynamics, and unpredictable rhythms. Improvisation without inhibition allows the choreographer to connect to their deepest creative self, which in turn clears the way for pure invention. This cognitive inhibition is similar to the inhibition described by Limb for musical improvisation, which can be found in the music section above.

Contact improvisation: a form developed in 1973, that is now practiced around the world. Contact improvisation originated from the movement studies of Steve Paxton in the 1970s and developed through the continued exploration of the Judson Dance Theater. It is a dance form based on weight sharing, partnering, playing with weight, exploring negative space and unpredictable outcomes.

===Sculpture===
Sculpture often relies on the enlargement of a small model or maquette to create the final work in a chosen material. Where the material is &quot;plastic&quot; such as clay, a working structure or armature often needs to be built to allow the pre-determined design to be realized. Alan Thornhill&#x27;s method for working with clay abandons the maquette, seeing it as &quot;ultimately deadening to creativity&quot;. Without the restrictions of the armature, a clay matrix of elements allows that when recognizable forms start to emerge, they can be essentially disregarded by turning the work, allowing for infinite possibility and the chance for the unforeseen to emerge more powerfully at a later stage.

Moving from &quot;adding and taking away&quot; to purely reductive working, the architectural considerations of turning the work are eased considerably but continued removal of material through the rejection of forms deemed &quot;too obvious&quot; can mean one ends up with nothing. Former pupil Jon Edgar uses Thornhill&#x27;s method as a creative extension to direct carving in stone and wood.

=== Film ===
The director Mike Leigh uses lengthy improvisations developed over a period of weeks to build characters and story lines for his films. He starts with some sketch ideas of how he thinks things might develop but does not reveal all his intentions with the cast who discover their fate and act out their responses as their destinies are gradually revealed, including significant aspects of their lives which will not subsequently be shown onscreen. The final filming draws on dialogue and actions that have been recorded during the improvisation period.

===Writing===
Improvisational writing is an exercise that imposes limitations on a writer such as a time limit, word limit, a specific topic, or rules on what can be written. This forces the writer to work within stream of consciousness and write without judgment of the work they produce. This technique is used for a variety of reasons, such as to bypass writer&#x27;s block, improve creativity, strengthen one&#x27;s writing instinct and enhance one&#x27;s flexibility in writing.

Some improvisational writing is collaborative, focusing on an almost dadaist form of collaborative fiction. This can take a variety of forms, from as basic as passing a notebook around a circle of writers with each writing a sentence, to coded environments that focus on collaborative novel-writing, like &quot;OtherSpace&quot;.

==Science and technology==
===Engineering===

Improvisation in engineering is to solve a problem with the tools and materials immediately at hand. Examples of such improvisation was the re-engineering of carbon dioxide scrubbers with the materials on hand during the Apollo 13 space mission, or the use of a knife in place of a screwdriver to turn a screw.

Engineering improvisations may be needed because of emergencies, embargo, obsolescence of a product and the loss of manufacturer support, or just a lack of funding appropriate for a better solution. Users of motor vehicles in parts of Africa develop improvised solutions where it is not feasible to obtain manufacturer-approved spare parts.

The popular television program &quot;MacGyver&quot; used as its gimmick a hero who could solve almost any problem with jury rigged devices from everyday materials, a Swiss Army knife and some duct tape.

<text>In music and other performing arts, the phrase  (; or &#x27;as you desire&#x27;), often shortened to &quot;ad lib&quot; (as an adjective or adverb) or &quot;ad-lib&quot; (as a verb or noun), refers to various forms of improvisation.

The roughly synonymous phrase (&#x27;in accordance with [one&#x27;s] good pleasure&#x27;) is less common but, in its Italian form , has entered the musical &quot;lingua franca&quot; (see below).

The phrase &quot;at liberty&quot; is often associated mnemonically (because of the alliteration of the &quot;lib-&quot; syllable), although it is not the translation (there is no cognation between and ). is the etymologically closer cognate known in English.

In biology and nutrition, the phrase is used to describe feeding without restriction.

== Music==
As a direction in sheet music, indicates that the performer or conductor has one of a variety of types of discretion with respect to a given passage:
*to play the passage in free time rather than in strict or &quot;metronomic&quot; tempo (a practice known as &quot;rubato&quot; when not expressly indicated by the composer);
*to improvise a melodic line fitting the general structure prescribed by the passage&#x27;s written notes or chords;
*to omit an instrument part, such as a nonessential accompaniment, for the duration of the passage; or
*in the phrase &quot;repeat &quot;, to play the passage an arbitrary number of times (&quot;cf.&quot; vamp).

Note that the direction (see above) has a more restricted meaning, generally referring to only the first two types of discretion. Baroque music, especially, has a written or implied , with most composers intimating the freedom the performer and conductor have.

For post-Baroque classical music and jazz, see cadenza.

==Other performing arts==
&quot;Ad-lib&quot; is used to describe individual moments during live theatre when an actor speaks through their character using words not found in the play&#x27;s text. When the entire performance is predicated on spontaneous creation, the process is called improvisational theatre.

In film, the term &quot;ad-lib&quot; usually refers to the interpolation of unscripted material in an otherwise scripted performance. For example, in interviews, Dustin Hoffman says he &quot;ad-libbed&quot; the now famous line, &quot;I&#x27;m walking here! I&#x27;m walking here!&quot; as &quot;Ratso&quot; Rizzo in &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; (1969). While filming at a streetcorner, the scene was interrupted by a taxi driver. Hoffman wanted to say, &quot;We&#x27;re filming a movie here!&quot;, but stayed in character, allowing the take to be used.

Some actors are also known for their ability or tendency to ad-lib, such as Peter Falk of the television series &quot;Columbo&quot;. When performing as Colombo, Falk would ad-lib such mannerisms as absent-mindedness, fumbling through his pockets, or asking for a pencil, all in a deliberate attempt to frustrate his co-stars in the scene and obtain a more genuine reaction.

Live performers such as television talk-show hosts sometimes deliver material that sounds ad-libbed but is actually scripted. They may employ &quot;ad-lib writers&quot; to prepare such material. 

The HBO sitcom &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; by Seinfeld co-creator Larry David primarily uses retroscripting and ad lib instead of scripted dialogue.

<text>Verónica Judith Sáinz Castro (; born 19 October 1952) is a Mexican actress, singer, producer, former model and presenter.

She started her career as a television actress, where she met comedian Manuel Valdés, father of her son Cristian Castro, and in fotonovelas and telenovelas while earning her degree in international relations.

==Acting and music career==

In 1986, she performed in the Latin version of &quot;We Are The World&quot;, Cantare, cantaras. She also released one of her most ambitious albums to date, &quot;Simplemente Todo.&quot; The top-selling singles from &quot;Simplemente Todo&quot; were &quot;Oye Tu,&quot; the title selection, &quot;Nunca Lo Sabra,&quot; and &quot;Macumba.&quot; Unlike other artists of the time, however, Castro accompanied her singles with videos, becoming one of the pioneers of the MTV age in Latin America. Even as she recorded the music video &quot;Macumba,&quot; she worked in telenovelas in Argentina and Italy.

During the 1990s, she began hosting variety shows, and has continued to do so since.

In 2009 Verónica Castro went back to telenovelas, and left Mexico for Argentina to film the telenovela &quot;Los Exitosos Pérez.&quot; It premiered in Mexico on August 30, 2009.

In 2017, she was cast as the matronly Virginia de la Mora in Netflix&#x27;s &quot;The House of Flowers&quot;, a Mexican comedy-drama series. It premiered on Netflix in August 2018.

<doc id="88785" wikidata="Q62899" url="?curid=88785" title="Steve Mann (inventor)">
<text>William Stephen George Mann (born 8 June 1962) is a Canadian engineer, professor, and inventor who works in augmented reality, computational photography, particularly wearable computing, and high-dynamic-range imaging. Mann has sometimes been labeled the &quot;Father of Wearable Computing&quot; for early inventions and continuing contributions to the field. He cofounded InteraXon, makers of the Muse brain-sensing headband, and is also a founding member of the IEEE Council on Extended Intelligence (CXI). Mann is currently CTO and cofounder at Blueberry X Technologies and Chairman of MannLab.
Mann was born in Canada, and currently lives in Toronto, Canada, with his wife and two children. In the 2023 Toronto mayoral by-election, Mann unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Toronto.

== Early life and education ==
Mann holds a PhD in Media Arts and Sciences (1997) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a B.Sc., B.Eng. and M.Eng. from McMaster University in 1987, 1989 and 1992, respectively. He was also inducted into the McMaster University Alumni Hall of Fame, Alumni Gallery 2004, in recognition of his career as an inventor and teacher. While at MIT, in then Director Nicholas Negroponte&#x27;s words, &quot;Steve Mann … brought the seed&quot; that founded the Wearable Computing group in the Media Lab and &quot;Steve Mann is the perfect example of someone … who persisted in his vision and ended up founding a new discipline.&quot; In 2004 he was named the recipient of the 2004 Leonardo Award for Excellence for his article &quot;Existential Technology,&quot; published in &quot;Leonardo&quot; 36:1.

He is also General Chair of the IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society, Associate Editor of &quot;IEEE Technology and Society&quot;, is a licensed Professional Engineer, and Senior Member of the IEEE, as well as a member of the IEEE Council on Extended Intelligence (CXI).
== Career ==
Mann is a tenured full professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, with cross-appointments to the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Faculty of Forestry at the University of Toronto, and is a Professional Engineer licensed through Professional Engineers Ontario.

=== Ideas and inventions ===

Many of Mann&#x27;s inventions pertain to the field of computational photography.
*Chirplet transform, 1991: Mann was the first to propose and reduce to practice a signal representation based on a family of chirp signals, each associated with a coefficient, in a generalization of the wavelet transform that is now referred to as the chirplet transform.
*&quot;Digital Eye Glass,&quot; &quot;Eye Glass,&quot; &quot;Glass Eye,&quot; or &quot;Glass&quot;, 1978: a device that, when worn, causes the human eye itself to effectively become both an electronic camera and a television display.
*Comparametric equations, 1993: Mann was the first to propose and implement an algorithm to estimate a camera&#x27;s response function from a plurality of differently exposed images of the same subject matter. He was also the first to propose and implement an algorithm to automatically extend dynamic range in an image by combining multiple differently exposed pictures of the same subject matter.
*High-dynamic-range imaging (HDR): &quot;The first report of digitally combining multiple pictures of the same scene to improve dynamic range appears to be Mann.&quot; (Robertson et al.) Mann&#x27;s work on wearable computing was motivated by his early computer vision systems that helped people see better (e.g. while welding, or in other high-dynamic range situations, with dynamic range management, overlays, and augmentation as well as diminishment in both the additive and subtractive sense).
*Hydraulophone: Mann invented an experimental musical instrument that uses pressurized hydraulic fluid, such as water, to make sound. The instrument is played by placing the fingers in direct contact with the sound-producing hydraulic fluid, thus giving the musician a high degree of control over the musical expression in the sound.
*Integral kinematics and integral kinesiology: principles of negative derivatives (integrals) of displacement, such as absement (the area under the displacement-time curve), as embodied by hydraulophones (water-based instruments). This work has been built upon by others, and also forms the basis for a new way of understanding electrical engineering. See also Mann&#x27;s 2014 paper, &quot;Integral Kinematics (Time‐Integrals of Distance, Energy, etc.) and Integral Kinesiology.&quot;
*Natural user interface: In the 1980s and &#x27;90s, Mann developed a number of user-interface strategies using natural interaction with the real world as an alternative to a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). Mann referred to this work as &quot;Natural User Interfaces&quot;, &quot;Direct User Interfaces&quot;, and &quot;Metaphor-Free Computing&quot;
* Scratch input, an acoustic-based method of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that takes advantage of the characteristic sound produced when a finger nail, stick, or other object strikes or is dragged over a surface, such as a table or wall.
*Sensory Singularity, together with Marvin Minsky and Ray Kurzweil, Mann proposed the theory of the &quot;Sensularity&quot; Sensory Singularity and cyborg-logging.
*Surveilluminescent wand: a device for visualizing vision and seeing sight, by way of making visible the sightfield (time-reversed lightfield) of a camera or similar computer vision sensor, using time-exposure with array of surveilluminescent lights to make visible to one camera what another camera can see.
*Telepointer and SixthSense, a wearable computer based on a pendant that contains a webcam and laser-based infinite depth-of-focus projector, and related technologies for gesture-based wearable computing systems.
*Video Orbits, 1993: Mann was the first to produce an algorithm for automatically combining multiple pictures of the same subject matter, using algebraic projective geometry, to &quot;stitch together&quot; images using automatically estimated perspective correction. This is called the &quot;Video Orbits&quot; algorithm.

Mann also works in the fields of computer-mediated reality. He is a strong advocate of privacy rights, for which work he was an award recipient of the Chalmers Foundation in the fine arts. His work also extends to the area of sousveillance (a term he coined for &quot;inverse surveillance&quot;). Mann and one of his PhD students, James Fung, together with some of his other students, have been building a cyborg community around the cyborg-logging concept.
* Mann, together with Professor Ian Kerr at the University of Ottawa, has written extensively on surveillance, sousveillance, and equiveillance. &quot;Sousveillance,&quot; a term coined by Mann, along with the concepts that he and Kerr have developed around these ideas, have created a new dialog for cyborg technologies, as well as related personal information gathering technologies like camera phones. He has created the related concept of humanistic intelligence.
* In 2003, Joi Ito credited Mann with having initiated the moblogging movement by creating a system for transmission of realtime pictures, video, and text. In particular, from 1994 to 1996, Mann continuously transmitted his life&#x27;s experiences, in real time, to his website for others to experience, interact with, and respond to.

His CyborGLOGS (&#x27;glogs), such as the spontaneous reporting of news as everyday experience, were an early predecessor of &#x27;blogs and the concept of blogging, and earlier than that, his pre-internet-era live streaming of personal documentary and cyborg communities defined cyborg-logging as a new form of social networking.

=== Anonequity project ===
Mann is currently collaborating with a number of researchers including Ian Kerr, Canada Research Chair in Ethics, Law &amp; Technology, University of Ottawa, who teaches a course on &quot;Cyborg Law&quot; that uses Mann&#x27;s book. Mann, together with Kerr and others, are doing an SSHRC-funded project to study the Ethics, Law &amp; Technology of anonymity, authentication, surveillance, and sousveillance, in addition to issues related to cyborg-law. The anonequity project is ongoing, and collaborator Kerr has also researched and lectured widely on implantable technologies.

== Media coverage ==
Mann has been referred to as the &quot;father of wearable computing&quot;, having created the first general-purpose wearable computer, in contrast to previous wearable devices that perform one specific function such as time-keeping (e.g. wristwatch); calculations (e.g. wearable abacus); or Edward O. Thorp and Claude Shannon&#x27;s wearable computers, which were timing devices concealed in shoes or cigarette packs and designed for gaining an advantage at roulette.

Mann has also been described as &quot;the world&#x27;s first cyborg&quot; in Canadian popular press such as &quot;NOW&quot;, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, &quot;National Post&quot;, and &quot;Toronto Life&quot;, but has himself rejected the term &quot;cyborg&quot; as being too vague.

In 2023, Steve Mann ran for Mayor of Toronto. As part of his campaign he advocated for recreational swimming in Lake Ontario, and supported a petition to save the beach at Ontario Place.

== Publications ==
Mann is author of more than 200 publications, including a textbook on electric eyeglasses and a popular culture book on day-to-day cyborg living. Selected works:
* &quot;Intelligent Image Processing&quot; 
* &quot;Cyborg: Digital Destiny and Human Possibility in the Age of the Wearable Computer&quot; Randomhouse Doubleday 2001
* &quot;The Wireless Application Protocol (WAP): A Wiley Tech Brief &quot;

<text>James Ronald Ryun (born April 29, 1947) is an American former Republican politician and Olympic track and field athlete, who at his peak was widely considered the world&#x27;s top middle-distance runner. He won a silver medal in the 1500 m at the 1968 Summer Olympics, and was the first high school athlete to run a mile in under four minutes. He is the last American to hold the world record in the mile run. Ryun later served in the United States House of Representatives from 1996 to 2007, representing Kansas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district.

==Athletics==
According to Ryun, he began running because

===Early years===
In 1964, as a high school junior at Wichita East High School, Ryun became the first high school athlete to run a mile in under 4 minutes in the time of 3:59.0, when he took 8th place at the 1964 California Relays, the last under four minutes in a historic mass finish under 4:00.
His time of 3:55.3, set winning the 1965 AAU Championship race ahead of Olympic gold medalist and former WR holder Peter Snell, was a high school record that stood for 36 years. Ryun ran five sub-four minute miles while in high school including the first sub-four minute mile run in a high school event, a 3:58.3, at the 1965 Kansas HS state meet. As a high school senior he was voted the fourth best miler in the world by &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot;. ESPN.com named him the best high school athlete of all time, beating out people such as Tiger Woods and LeBron James. He was &quot;Track and Field News&quot; &quot;High School Athlete of the Year&quot; in 1965.

===Post-high school===
In 1966, at age nineteen, Ryun set two world records, first in the half-mile (1:44.9) then the mile (3:51.3). He received numerous awards, including &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award, the James E. Sullivan Award as the nation&#x27;s top amateur athlete, the ABC&#x27;s Wide World of Sports Athlete of the Year award, and the Track &amp; Field News&#x27; Athlete of the Year award as the world&#x27;s best track &amp; field athlete.

In 1967, Ryun set a world record in the indoor half mile (1:48.3) and the outdoor mile from (3:51.1), a record that stood for almost eight years. That same year he set the world record for the 1,500 meters (3:33.1).
In NCAA competition, Ryun was the 1967 NCAA outdoor mile champion. He was also the NCAA indoor mile champion in 1967, 1968, and 1969.

Ryun still holds the American junior (19 and under) records at one mile (3:51.3) and two miles (8:25.1). His American junior record in the 1,500 meters of 3:36.1 was broken by Hobbs Kessler on May 29, 2021, awaiting ratification by USA Track and Field. His American junior record in the 800 meters lasted exactly 50 years. In all, he broke the American record for the mile four times: once as a high school senior (3:55.3 on June 27, 1965), twice as a college freshman (3:53.7 on June 4, 1966, and 3:51.3 on July 17, 1966), and once as a college sophomore (3:51.1 on June 23, 1967).
Ryun participated in the 1964, 1968, and 1972 Summer Olympics. At age 17 years, 137 days in 1964, he remains the second youngest American male track athlete to ever qualify for the Olympics, behind Quincy Wilson. In 1968, he won the silver medal in the 1,500 meters in Mexico City, losing to Kip Keino from Kenya, whose remarkable race remained the Olympic 1,500-meter record for 16 years. Before the race, Ryun had thought that a time of 3:39 would be good enough to win in the high altitude of Mexico City. He ended up running faster than that with a 3:37.8, but half-way through the race Keino had moved into the first position at world record pace. Ryun continued to move up during the last two laps from eighth to second but was never closer than about 30 yards from Keino, who finished in 3:34.91, an Olympic record that would stand until 1984, despite the altitude. Years later, in 1981, he told Tex Maule in an interview for &quot;The Runner&quot; magazine, &quot;We had thought that 3:39 would win and I ran under that. I considered it like winning a gold medal; I had done my very best and I still believe I would have won at sea level.&quot; Ryun was attacked by some writers who believed he had let his nation down. &quot;Some even said I had let down the whole world. I didn&#x27;t get any credit for running my best and no one seemed to realize that Keino had performed brilliantly.&quot; In the 1972 Munich, Germany, Games, he was tripped and fell down during a 1,500-meter qualifying heat. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) acknowledged that a foul had occurred, U.S. appeals to have Ryun reinstated in the competition were denied by the IOC.
Ryun&#x27;s 1,500-meter world record, run in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during the United States vs. British Commonwealth meet in July 1967, was one of Ryun&#x27;s greatest running performances. &quot;Track and Field News&quot; reported that &quot;after 220 yards of dawdling, a record seemed out of the question.&quot; However, after 440 yards, which Ryun, in third, passed in 60.9 seconds, Kip Keino took the lead and ran the next lap in 56 seconds (the fastest second lap ever run at the time). Ryun, just behind, passed the 880-yard mark in 1:57.0. At 1,320 yards the two were side by side in 2:55.0. Ryun pulled away to finish in 3:33.1, a record that stood for seven years. With a last 440 yards of 53.9, a last 880 yards of 1:51.3, and the final 1320 yards in 2:47.4, Cordner Nelson of &quot;Track and Field News&quot; called it &quot;the mightiest finishing drive ever seen,&quot; and said of Ryun&#x27;s performance, &quot;This was most certainly his greatest race.&quot;

Ryun&#x27;s final season as an amateur was in 1972, and included the third-best mile of his career (at the time, the third fastest in history: a 3:52.8 at Toronto, Canada on July 29): a 5,000-meter career best (13:38.2 at Bakersfield, CA on May 20), and a win in the 1,500 meters at the U.S. Olympic Trials. His last race at the Olympics was a 1,500‐meter preliminary heat on September 8, 1972. He fell after a collision with Ghana&#x27;s Billy Fordjour as both trailed in the last 500 meters. He got up despite being eighty meters behind and completed the heat but finished 30 meters in back of the pack and did not qualify for the final. He left amateur athletics after 1972 and for the next two years ran professionally on the International Track Association circuit.

===World records===
Notes:
*Because 880 yards is longer than 800 meters, the 1:44.9 was converted into an estimated en-route-time at 800 meters of 1:44.3, which equaled the existing 800 meters world record, but was not ratified as a record in that event. The 880 yards mark remained the world and American record until broken by Rick Wohlhuter&#x27;s 1.44.6 in 1973.
*The 3:33.1 1,500 meters mark remained the world record for six years until broken by Tanzania&#x27;s Filbert Bayi&#x27;s 3:32.2 in 1974.
*The 3:51.1-mile mark remained the world record for eight years until broken by Bayi&#x27;s 3:51.0 in 1975.

===Athletic awards===

*Track &amp; Field News Athlete of the Year award for both 1966 and 1967, the first athlete to win this prestigious award two years in a row.
*1966 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year award. He also graced the cover of Sports Illustrated 5 times.

In 1980, Ryun was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame and in 2003 into the National Distance Running Hall of Fame.

Ryan has competed in Masters athletics as well.

==Personal life==

Ryun was born in Wichita, Kansas. He now lives in Lawrence, though he was listed in the House roll as &quot;R-Topeka&quot;. He also owns a farm in Jefferson County.

Ryun met his wife, Anne, when she asked him for an autograph after he broke the world record for the mile in Berkeley. They married in 1969 and have two sons, Ned and Drew Ryun, and seven grandchildren. He and his sons, Ned and Drew, have co-authored three books: &quot;Heroes Among Us&quot;, &quot;The Courage to Run&quot;, and &quot; In Quest of Gold – The Jim Ryun Story.&quot;

After graduating from the University of Kansas in 1970 with a degree in photojournalism, Ryun moved to Eugene, Oregon; looking for a good training situation to continue his track career. Six months later, he moved to Santa Barbara, California, where he and his family remained for nine years. He and his family moved back to Lawrence in 1981.

Raised in the Church of Christ, Ryun and his wife are members of Grace Evangelical Presbyterian Church in Lawrence.

President Donald Trump awarded Jim Ryun the Presidential Medal of Freedom on July 24, 2020.
==Career prior to election to Congress==
Before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1996, Ryun had operated Jim Ryun Sports, a company that ran sports camps, and worked as a motivational speaker at meetings of corporations and Christian groups around the country. Among his projects, Ryun, who has a 50% hearing loss, helped the ReSound Hearing Aid Company develop a program called Sounds of Success, aimed at helping children with hearing loss. Since 1973, Ryun and his family have hosted running camps every summer for promising high school aged runners.

==House of Representatives==

According to Ryun, he was interested in politics but did not have plans to run for Congress until Todd Tiahrt told him during the 1996 Summer Olympics torch relay that the Topeka-based 2nd District would have a vacancy and suggested that he run.

===Elections===
Ryun was first elected in 1996 to fill a seat vacated by Republican Sam Brownback. He won the three-person Republican primary with 62 percent of the vote, defeating former Topeka mayor Doug Wright and Cheryl Brown Henderson, the daughter of the plaintiff in the historic &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; desegregation case. In the general campaign, Ryun was in a tight race with Democrat John Frieden, a prominent Topeka trial attorney, who outspent Ryun $750,000 to $400,000. Ryun won that contest with 52 percent of the vote. He would not face another contest nearly that close for almost a decade; he was reelected three times with at least 60 percent of the vote.

In 2004, Democrat Nancy Boyda, a former moderate Republican, ran a campaign with spending near that of Ryun&#x27;s, $1,105,838 (compared to Ryun&#x27;s $1,136,464). Ryun defeated her by a margin of 55% to 42%, mainly due to the presence of George W. Bush atop the ticket.

In the 2006 election, Boyda was again the Democratic nominee, with Roger Tucker of the Reform Party of the United States of America also on the ballot. Initially expected to win, Ryun found his campaign faltering as internal polling for both his campaign and Boyda&#x27;s revealed Boyda was ahead. In response, Ryun&#x27;s campaign recruited both President Bush and Vice President Cheney to visit Topeka to campaign and raise campaign funds for Ryun. Ryun was defeated in an upset by Boyda, 51% to 47%.

In March 2007, Ryun confirmed that he would run for his old seat. In the Republican primary, he faced Kansas State Treasurer Lynn Jenkins, a slightly more moderate Republican who served two terms as State Treasurer, a partial term in the Kansas Senate and two years in the Kansas House. Ryun lost to Jenkins, who went on to win the seat in the general election, 51% to 46%.

===Political actions===
Ryun served on the Armed Services, Budget and Financial Services committees. He tallied a strongly conservative voting record.

Ryun generally supported George W. Bush&#x27;s legislative agenda, voting to support it 89% of the time, average for a House member who was from the same party as the sitting president. In 2003, he voted against the $373 billion end-of-session spending bill because he considered it to be too costly and had come to Congress to support fiscal restraint.

Ryun broke with the President over two major initiatives, No Child Left Behind and Medicare reform legislation that included a prescription drug benefit. In voting against No Child Left Behind, Ryun said he believed states should have more control over their own education system. In opposing the Medicare bill, Ryun said the bill didn&#x27;t provide enough reform to keep future costs from soaring.

In 2006, the &quot;National Journal&quot; rated Ryun as the nation&#x27;s most conservative member of Congress. He was a member of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of 103 fiscally and socially conservative House Republicans.

===Environmental record===
In 2005, Ryun scored 0 percent on the Republicans for Environmental Protection (&quot;REP&quot;) scorecard. There were 12 issues that were considered by the REP to be critical environmental issues. Jim Ryun voted with what the REP would consider pro-environment on none of the issues voted upon. These issues consisted of the drilling of oil and natural gas, Congressman Richard Pombo&#x27;s bill designed to weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, an amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005, by Congresswoman Lois Capps to remove section 1502, a provision that would provide liability protection for manufacturers of the gasoline additive MTBE, and the movement to increase fuel economy standards.

Ryun also scored a 0 on League of Conservation Voters&#x27;s (&quot;LCV&quot;) scorecard. Many of REP&#x27;s critical issues were present on the scorecard.

In 2006, Ryun improved his REP scorecard when he voted pro-environment on 2 of 7 critical issues. This earned him a 17 percent. He voted to help reduce the impact the Army Corps of Engineers had on the environment. The issues in which he voted against the REP were ones involving oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, renewable resource programs, and the movement to end debate and accept the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act.

==Controversies==

===Townhouse purchase in 2000===
On December 15, 2000, Ryun bought a townhouse in the District of Columbia from U.S. Family Network for $410,000. The townhouse had been purchased about two years earlier, for $429,000, to house Ed Buckham&#x27;s consulting firm Alexander Strategy Group and Tom DeLay&#x27;s ARMPAC.

After questions were raised as to the purchase of Ryun&#x27;s townhouse, his office released official documents showing that Ryun paid $80,000 more than the tax assessed value of the house, that he put another $50,000 into house repairs and that another home on the same block was sold for $409,000 on the same day he bought his home. According to property records, the other home does not have a garage or a back patio and is on a land area about half the size of Ryun&#x27;s. It was assessed in 2006 as worth $528,000, compared to $764,000 for Ryun&#x27;s home. In contrast, homes across the street from Ryun&#x27;s were sold for over $900,000.

===Connection to Mark Foley===
After Rep. Mark Foley resigned in October 2006, following revelations he had sent sexually explicit e-mails to teenage congressional pages, Ryun contended that he barely knew Foley, had never spent time with him and was unaware that they lived directly across the street from each other in Washington, D.C. &quot;I know that [we were neighbors] only because somebody has mentioned that, too, already,&quot; he told reporters at the time. However, it was later revealed that Ryun and Foley had hosted a joint fundraiser on their street on May 18, 2006, called the &quot;D Street Block Party&quot;. An invitation to the fundraiser included side-by-side pictures of Ryun and Foley. Ryun&#x27;s campaign manager later said that Ryun had always known he was Foley&#x27;s neighbor.

<text>A four-minute mile is the completion of a mile run (1.6 km) in four minutes or less. It translates to an average speed of 15 miles per hour (24 km/h). It is a standard of professional middle-distance runners in several cultures.

The first four-minute mile is usually attributed to the English athlete Roger Bannister, who ran it in 1954 at age 25 in 3:59.4. The mile record has since been lowered by 16.27 seconds. , the &quot;four-minute barrier&quot; has been broken by 1,755 athletes. The record for the fastest time stands at 3:43.13, achieved by the Moroccan athlete Hicham El Guerrouj, at age 24, in 1999.

==Record holders==


On 30 October 1863, William Lang ran a downhill mile time trial in 4:02 in Newmarket, Suffolk, England. Due to the downhill slope, the time would not have been valid for record-keeping but nonetheless would be the fastest mile ever run until 1943, and began speculation about when the first sub-four-minute mile would be performed.

The four-minute barrier was first broken on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University&#x27;s Iffley Road Track, by British athlete Roger Bannister, with the help of fellow runners Chris Chataway and Chris Brasher as pacemakers.

On 21 June 1954, at an international meet at Turku, Finland, Australia&#x27;s John Landy became the second man, after Bannister, to achieve a sub-four-minute mile. He achieved a world record time of 3:57.9, ratified by the IAAF as 3:58.0 owing to the rounding rules then in effect. He held this record for more than three years.

Two months later, on 7 August, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., Landy and Bannister both ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race&#x27;s end is memorialised in a photo, and later a statue, of the two, with Landy looking over his left shoulder, just as Bannister is passing him on the right. Landy thus lost the race. The statue was placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza. Bannister won in 3 min 58.8 s, with Landy 0.8 s behind in 3 min 59.6 s.

New Zealand&#x27;s John Walker, who with a 3:49.4 performance in August 1975 became the first man to run the mile under 3:50, ran 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria&#x27;s Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45. Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco&#x27;s Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.

In 1964, America&#x27;s Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965. Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun&#x27;s high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001. Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes. In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart. Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001. On 6 February 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb&#x27;s mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track and 3:57.81 two weeks later. Hunter achieved the 4-minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic. At that same meet Michael Slagowski ran his second sub-4-minute of the season. Reed Brown dipped under the barrier on 1 June 2017, running the 4th fastest high school mile time ever recorded in a race: 3:59.30. In 2020, Leo Daschbach clocked 3:59.54 during the Quarantine Clasico, moving to ninth on the all time list.

Another illustration of the progression of performance in the men&#x27;s mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister&#x27;s breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile. Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK&#x27;s Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012.

In 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister&#x27;s accomplishment. He did it again in February 1998, falling just 0.3 seconds behind his previous performance of 7:58.61. On 9 June 2023, Norwegian runner Jakob Ingebrigtsen bested that time, running 7:54.10 to become only the second individual to run two miles in less than eight minutes.

Ingebrigtsen also holds the record as the youngest runner to run a four-minute mile, having run 3:58.07 at the Prefontaine Classic in May 2017, when he was 16 years and 250 days old. However, indoor world champion Yomif Kejelcha of Ethiopia, born 1 August 1997, ran 4:57.74 in an indoor 2000 m race on 28 February 2014, at age 16 years and 212 days. The run averages to a pace of 3:59.58 per mile for the 1.24-mile race.

===Women===
No woman has yet run a four-minute mile. The women&#x27;s world record is currently at 4:07.64, set by Faith Kipyegon of Kenya at the Diamond League meeting in Monaco on 21 July 2023. An earlier women&#x27;s world record, 4:12.56 set by Svetlana Masterkova of Russia on 14 August 1996 at Zürich, stood for almost 23 years: Masterkova became the first woman to run the mile in less than 4 minutes and 15 seconds.

Kipyegon&#x27;s run has led some to speculate that the first women&#x27;s sub-four minute mile may come within the 21st century. Some organizations such as the Fast Forest project have considered the 4:30-minute mile barrier to be a roughly equivalent benchmark for women, though there are fewer women&#x27;s sub-4:30 runners than there are men&#x27;s sub-4:00 runners.

== Possible other claims ==
A number of people are claimed to have beaten the four-minute mile before Bannister.

===James Parrott (1770)===
Some (notably Olympic medallist Peter Radford) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run by James Parrott on 9 May 1770. He ran the 1-mile, west-to-east, length of Old Street to finish somewhere within the grounds/building of Shoreditch Church. Timing methods at this time were—after the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison—accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly, and sporting authorities of the time accepted the claim as genuine. Old Street has an 11 foot downward fall, with intermittent gentle undulations. Neal Bascomb notes in &quot;The Perfect Mile&quot; that &quot;even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.&quot;

=== Weller Run (1796) ===
On 10 October 1796, &quot;The Sporting Magazine&quot; reported that a young man called Weller, who was one of three brothers, &quot;undertook for a wager of three guineas to run one mile on the Banbury Road, in four minutes, which he performed two seconds within the time.&quot; This is yet about 5 months&#x27; worth of typical rural labourer pay at the time. By the late 1700s, a mile could be routinely measured to within a few inches; watches, thanks to John Harrison, could measure 4 minutes to within 0.0009 sec (i.e. gain or lose 10 seconds a month), and after about 1750 the mass production of highly accurate watches was well underway.

===Big Hawk Chief (1876 or 1877)===
During his time as a Pawnee runner, Big Hawk Chief possibly became the first person documented to run a sub-four-minute mile. The details of the event, as chronicled by Army Officer, Captain Luther North, clocked the mile at 3 minutes and 58 seconds.

===Glenn Cunningham (1920s)===
It is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record.

==In popular culture==
In 1955 Putnam &amp; Co. Ltd. published Roger Bannister&#x27;s account of the events in &quot;First Four Minutes&quot;. This was later adapted as &quot;The Four-Minute Mile&quot; by Reader&#x27;s Digest in 1958.

In the 17 November 1956 Season 2 Episode 26 Whole No. 65 of &quot;Science Fiction Theatre&quot; entitled &quot;Three Minute Mile&quot;, a scientist (Marshall Thompson) attempts to create a super athlete (Martin Milner).

In the 1971 film &quot;The Omega Man&quot;, protagonist Robert Neville, as played by Charlton Heston, claims to have run a mile in 3 minutes and 50 seconds.

In 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced &quot;The Four Minute Mile&quot;, a miniseries dramatization of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.

In 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled &quot;The Perfect Mile&quot; about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee, portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled &quot;Four Minutes&quot;) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.

Also in 2004, a 50 pence coin was minted in the United Kingdom to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Bannister running the four-minute mile. There were 9,032,500 minted in 2004. The coin was re-struck in 2019 as part of the &#x27;50 years of the 50p coin&#x27; set released by the Royal Mint, only for collector sets.

In 2005, ESPN released a television adaptation of the event called &quot;Four Minutes&quot; featuring Jamie Maclachlan as Roger Bannister and Christopher Plummer as his wheelchair-using coach, Archie Mason.

In June 2011, the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club; it sold for £97,250.

In July 2016, the BBC broadcast the documentary &quot;Bannister: Everest on the Track, The Roger Bannister Story&quot; with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4-minute mile.

<text>The eagle rays are a group of cartilaginous fishes in the family Myliobatidae, consisting mostly of large species living in the open ocean rather than on the sea bottom.

Eagle rays feed on mollusks, and crustaceans, crushing their shells with their flattened teeth. They are excellent swimmers and are able to breach the water up to several meters above the surface. Compared with other rays, they have long tails, and well-defined, rhomboidal bodies. They are ovoviviparous, giving birth to up to six young at a time. They range from in length and 7 m (23 ft) in wingspan.

==Classification==
Nelson&#x27;s book &quot;Fishes of the World&quot; treats cownose rays, mantas, and devil rays as subfamilies in the Myliobatidae. However, most authors (including William Toby White) have preferred to leave the Rhinopteridae and Mobulidae outside of the Myliobatidae. White (2014) retained three genera (&quot;Aetobatus&quot;, &quot;Aetomylaeus&quot;, and &quot;Myliobatis&quot;) in the Myliobatidae, while a fourth (&quot;Pteromylaeus&quot;) was synonymized with &quot;Aetomylaeus&quot;. A 2016 paper placed &quot;Aetobatus&quot; in its own family, the Aetobatidae.

<text>The Salvation Army (TSA) is a Protestant Christian church and an international charitable organisation headquartered in London, England. It is aligned with the Wesleyan-Holiness movement. The organisation reports a worldwide membership of over 1.7million, consisting of soldiers, officers, and adherents who are collectively known as salvationists. Its founders sought to bring salvation to the poor, destitute, and hungry by meeting both their &quot;physical and spiritual needs&quot;. It is present in 133 countries, running charity shops, operating shelters for the homeless, and disaster relief and humanitarian aid to developing countries.

The theology of the Salvation Army derives from Methodism, although it differs in institution and practice; an example is that the Salvation Army does not observe sacraments. As with other denominations in the Holiness Methodist tradition, the Salvation Army lays emphasis on the New Birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). A distinctive characteristic of the Salvation Army is its use of titles derived from military ranks, such as &quot;lieutenant&quot; or &quot;major&quot;. The Army&#x27;s doctrine is aligned with the Wesleyan–Arminian tradition, particularly the holiness movement. The Army&#x27;s purposes are &quot;the advancement of the Christian religion... of education, the relief of poverty, and other charitable objects beneficial to society or the community of mankind as a whole&quot;.

The Salvation Army was founded in 1865 as the &quot;East London Christian Mission&quot; in London by one-time Methodist preacher William Booth and his wife Catherine. It can trace its origins to the Blind Beggar Tavern. In 1878, Booth reorganised the mission, becoming its first general and introducing the military structure, which it has retained as a matter of tradition. The Salvation Army&#x27;s highest priority is its Christian principles. the international leader and chief executive officer (CEO) of The Salvation Army is General Lyndon Buckingham.

The Salvation Army is the largest non-government provider of social services in the United States and one of the largest in the world, with expenditures including operating costs of US$3.6 billion in 2022, assisting more than 32 million people in the U.S. alone. In addition to funding feeding centres, homeless shelters, rehabilitation centres, community centres, and disaster relief, the organisation also establishes refugee camps, especially among displaced people in Africa. In the United Kingdom, the Salvation Army is no longer the largest non-governmental provider of social services; however, it still provides a significant service to people in need. The Salvation Army is the fourth largest charity in the United States, with private donations in excess of US$2 billion in 2022. It is a member of many national interdenominational groups, including the American organisation Christian Churches Together.

==Ministers==

The Salvation Army refers to its ministers as &quot;officers&quot;. When they are acting in their official capacities, they can often be recognised by the colour-coded epaulettes on their white uniform dress shirts. The epaulettes have the letter &quot;S&quot; embroidered on them in white. Officer ranks include Lieutenant, Captain, Major, Lieutenant Colonel, Colonel, Commissioner, and General. Promotion in rank from Lieutenant to Major depends primarily on years of service.

Officers are given Marching Orders to change ministries within the Salvation Army. Usually, officers are given new marching orders every two to five years and reassigned to different posts, sometimes moving great distances.

The Salvation Army permits the ordination of women. Salvation Army officers were previously allowed to marry only other officers (this rule varied in different countries); but this rule has been relaxed in recent years. Husbands and wives usually share the same rank and have the same or similar assignments. Such officer-couples are assigned together to act as co-pastors and to administer corps, Adult Rehabilitation Centres, and such.

==Facilities==
===Churches===
The Army has churches throughout the world, known as Salvation Army corps. These serve as churches and community centres. Traditionally, many corps buildings are also called temples or citadels.

===Thrift stores and charity shops===

The Salvation Army is well known for its network of thrift stores or charity shops—colloquially referred to as &quot;the Sally Ann&quot; in Canada and the United States, &quot;Salvos Stores&quot; in Australia, and &quot;Sally&#x27;s&quot; in New Zealand—which raise money for its rehabilitation programs by selling donated used items such as clothing, housewares, and toys. Clothing collected by Salvation Army stores that is not sold on location is often sold wholesale on the global secondhand clothing market.
The Salvation Army&#x27;s fundraising shops in the United Kingdom participated in the UK government&#x27;s Work Programme, a workfare programme in which benefit claimants had to work for no compensation for 20 to 40 hours per week over periods as long as six months.

When people buy items at Salvation Army thrift stores, part of the proceeds go toward The Salvation Army&#x27;s emergency relief efforts and programs. Textile items not sold are recycled and turned into other items such as carpet underlay. The Salvation Army also helps their employees by hiring ex-felons, depending on the circumstances, because they believe in giving people second chances.

===Adult Rehabilitation Centres===
Some Salvation Army locations are associated with an Adult Rehabilitation Centre (ARC) in which men and women make a six-month rehabilitation commitment to live and work at the ARC residence. They are unpaid, but provided with room and board. Many ARCs are male-only. The program is primarily to combat addiction. Residents work at the warehouse, store, or residence. This is referred to as &quot;work therapy&quot;. They attend classes, twelve-step programs, and chapel services as a part of their rehabilitation. The Army advertises these programs on their collection trucks with the slogan &quot;Doing the Most Good&quot;. An ARC is typically associated with a main store and warehouse. Donations are consolidated from other stores and donation sites, sorted and priced, and then distributed back out to the branch stores. Low-quality donated items are sold at the warehouse dock in a &quot;dock sale&quot;.

===Hadleigh Farm Colony===
Farmland at Hadleigh in Essex featured market gardens, orchards, and two brickfields. It was mentioned in the Royal Commission report of 1909, which was appointed to consider Poor Laws. 7,000 trainees had passed through its doors by 1912 with more than 60% subsequently finding employment.

===Other===

The Salvation Army operates children&#x27;s summer camps and adult day care centres. It has headquarter offices internationally, nationally, and for each territory and division. Some of its other facilities include:
* Homeless hostels
* Residential addiction dependency programs
* Children&#x27;s homes
* Homes for elderly persons
* Mother and baby homes
* Women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s refuge centres
* General hospitals
* Schools
* Maternity hospitals
* After School Programs
* Food Pantries
* Overnight Warming Stations
* Cooling Stations

==Beliefs==

The official mission statement reads:

The Salvation Army, an international movement, is an evangelical part of the universal Christian church. Its message is based on the Bible. Its ministry is motivated by the love of God. Its mission is to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ and to meet human needs in His name without discrimination.

Early beliefs of the Salvation Army were influenced by the book &quot;Helps to Holiness&quot;, which influenced spiritual life in the Army for a generation. The sacred text of the Salvation Army is the Bible, and the beliefs of the Salvation Army rest upon these eleven doctrines:

# We believe that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments were given by inspiration of God; and that they only constitute the Divine rule of Christian faith and practice.
# We believe that there is only one God, who is infinitely perfect, the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of all things, and who is the only proper object of religious worship.
# We believe that there are three persons in the Godhead – the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost – undivided in essence and co-equal in power and glory.
# We believe that in the person of Jesus Christ, the Divine and human natures are united, so that He is truly and properly God and truly and properly man.
# We believe that our first parents were created in a state of innocency, but by their disobedience, they lost their purity and happiness; and that in consequence of their fall all men have become sinners, totally depraved, and as such are justly exposed to the wrath of God.
# We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ has, by His suffering and death, made an atonement for the whole world so that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.
# We believe that repentance towards God, faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and regeneration by the Holy Spirit are necessary to salvation.
# We believe that we are justified by grace, through faith in our Lord Jesus Christ; and that he that believeth hath the witness in himself.
# We believe that continuance in a state of salvation depends upon continued obedient faith in Christ.
# We believe that it is the privilege of all believers to be wholly sanctified, and that their whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
# We believe in the immortality of the soul; in the resurrection of the body; in the general judgment at the end of the world; in the eternal happiness of the righteous; and in the endless punishment of the wicked.
The denomination does not celebrate sacraments, such as Baptism and Holy Communion. The position of the International Spiritual Life Commission, which is convened by the general to examine and identify aspects of the Army&#x27;s life which are essential or integral to the spiritual growth, opinion is that enrollment as a Soldier by accepting the call to discipleship should be followed by a lifetime of continued obedient faith in Christ. The Commission&#x27;s considered opinion of Holy Communion is that God&#x27;s grace is readily accessible in all places and at all times, although Salvationists may participate in Holy Communion if attending a service of worship in another Christian denomination if the host Church allows. 

Although its officers conduct marriages, the Salvation Army holds a traditional Protestant belief that marriage was not instituted by Christ and therefore is not a sacrament. The mercy seat is a focal point in a Salvation Army Church, symbolizing God&#x27;s call to his people, and a place for commitment and communion, and is available for anyone to kneel at in prayer.

===Worship services===
The Salvation Army does not require anyone attending a service to be a member of the Salvation Army in any capacity (as a Soldier, Adherent, or Officer). Services in Salvation Army churches feature a variety of activities:
* The service often begins with a greeting from the Minister.
* Hymns are sung, accompanied by backing music.
* There is a scripture reading from the Bible.
* Prayers are led by the Minister leading the service.
* Depending on demand, a Sunday School may be run in another room.
* A collection is held to receive a financial offering, either loose money or coins in a &quot;cartridge envelope&quot;. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tithes and Offerings&quot;.
* The congregation sings the doxology.
* A sermon on the Bible reading is then given.
* The service concludes with a benediction.

Local corps usually sing contemporary worship music songs in Sunday worship services and traditional hymns from the official Songbook of the Salvation Army. Music is often accompanied by a brass band. Many American corps adopted a mainstream Christian format with video screens showing words to music so that the audience can sing along. The early Salvation Army bands were known for their excitement and public appeal, and the modern ensemble keeps to this ideology. Traditional hymns are blended with other musical pieces from Christian Music Publishers such as Vineyard Music, Hillsong, and Planet Shakers to name but a few.

===Soldier&#x27;s Covenant===

The Soldier&#x27;s Covenant is the creed of the Salvation Army. All members of the church are allowed to subscribe to this creed; every person has to sign the document before they can become enrolled as a Soldier. Members have traditionally been referred to as &quot;soldiers&quot; of Christ. These were formerly known as the &quot;Articles of War&quot;, and include &quot;Having received with all my heart the salvation offered to me by the tender mercy of God, I do here and now acknowledge God the Father to be my King; God the Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, to be my Saviour; and God the Holy Spirit to be my Guide, Comforter and Strength, and I will, by His help, love, serve, worship and obey this glorious God through time and in eternity.&quot;

===Positional Statements===
Positional Statements describe Salvation Army policy on various social and moral issues. They are carefully considered by the International Headquarters of The Salvation Army. They are derived from work by the International Moral and Social Issues Council. The Salvation Army opposes euthanasia and assisted suicide. Its official stance on abortion is that &quot;The Salvation Army believes in the sanctity of all human life and considers each person to be of infinite value and each life a gift from God to be cherished, nurtured and redeemed. Human life is sacred because it is made in the image of God and has an eternal destiny. (Genesis 1:27) Sacredness is not conferred, nor can it be taken away by human agreement.&quot; The Salvation Army official stance admitted in 2010 exceptions in cases such as rape and incest: &quot;In addition, rape and incest are brutal acts of dominance violating women physically and emotionally. This situation represents a special case for the consideration of termination as the violation may be compounded by the continuation of the pregnancy.&quot; It is also against the death penalty: &quot;The Salvation Army recognises that the opinions of Salvationists are divided on the moral acceptability of capital punishment and its effectiveness as a deterrent. However, to advocate in any way the continuance or restoration of capital punishment in any part of the world would be inconsistent with the Army&#x27;s purposes and contrary to the Army&#x27;s belief that all human life is sacred and that each human being, however wretched, can become a new person in Christ.&quot;

In 2012, the Salvation Army, Australian Territories published a &quot;Positional Statement on Homosexuality&quot; after receiving adverse publicity about their position on homosexuality.

On 8 December 2017, the Salvation Army released an International Positional Statement on racism which says that racism is &quot;fundamentally incompatible with the Christian conviction that all people are made in the image of God and are equal in value. The Salvation Army believes that the world is enriched by a diversity of cultures and ethnicities.&quot;

==Community services==
===Disaster relief===

In the United States, the Salvation Army&#x27;s first major forays into disaster relief resulted from the tragedies of the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. General Evangeline Booth offered the services of Salvationists to President Woodrow Wilson during the First World War.

The Salvation Army is a nongovernmental relief agency. After the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004, they arrived at the disaster sites to help retrieve and bury the dead. Since then they have helped rebuild homes and construct new boats for people to recover their livelihood. Members were prominent among relief organisations after Hurricane Hugo and Hurricane Andrew. In August 2005, they supplied drinking water to poor people affected by the heat wave in the United States. Later in 2005 they responded to hurricanes Katrina and Rita. They helped the victims of an earthquake in Indonesia in May 2006.
Since Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, the Salvation Army has allocated donations of more than US$365 million to serve more than 1.7 million people in nearly every American state. The Army&#x27;s immediate response to Hurricane Katrina included the mobilization of more than 178 canteen feeding units and 11 field kitchens which together served more than 5.7 million hot meals, 8.3 million sandwiches, snacks, and drinks. Its SATERN (Salvation Army Team Emergency Radio Network) network of amateur ham-radio operators picked up where modern communications left off to help locate more than 25,000 survivors. Salvation Army pastoral care counselors were on hand to comfort the emotional and spiritual needs of 277,000 individuals. As part of the effort, Salvation Army officers, employees, and volunteers contributed more than 900,000 hours of service.

The Salvation Army was one of the first relief agencies on the scene of the September 11 attacks in New York City in 2001. They also provided prayer support for families of missing people.

The Salvation Army, along with the American National Red Cross, Southern Baptist Convention, and other disaster relief organisations, are members of the National Voluntary Organisations Active in Disaster (NVOAD).

Around the world, the Salvation Army have emergency services support emergency disaster services in the United States. These are mobile canteen vehicles that provide food and other welfare to members of the Emergency Services at bushfires, floods, land search, and other large- and small-scale emergency operations undertaken by Police, Fire, Ambulance, and State Emergency Service members, and to the general public affected by such events. Volunteers and officers run the canteen service. They respond when emergency services have been on the scene for more than four hours or where four or more Fire vehicles are responding.

===Family Tracing Service===
The Family Tracing Service (sometimes known as the Missing Persons Service) was established in 1885, and the service is now available in most of the countries where The Salvation Army operates. The Tracing Service&#x27;s objective is to restore (or to sustain) family relationships where contact has been lost, whether recently or in the distant past. Thousands of people are traced every year on behalf of their relatives.

===Youth groups===
The Salvation Army includes many youth groups, which primarily consist of its Sunday schools and the Scout and Guide packs. The Scout and Guide packs are affiliated with and sponsored by the Salvation Army but are open units that allow anyone to join. These units/packs observe Christian standards and encourage young people to investigate and develop in their Christian faith. Some territories have a Salvation Army Guards and Legions Association (SAGALA). In the United States youth groups that are specifically for girls are known as Girl Guards (older girls) and Sunbeams (younger girls). Adventure Corps serves boys who are enrolled in school for first through eighth grades, and is sometimes separated into Rangers (6th–8th Grade) and Explorers (5th Grade and younger).

====Alove UK====
In the 21st century, the Salvation Army in the United Kingdom created a branch for the youth, called Alove: the Salvation Army for a new generation. Its purpose is to free the youth of the church and their communities to express themselves and their faith in their own ways. Its mission statement is &quot;Calling a generation to dynamic faith, radical lifestyle, adventurous mission and a fight for justice&quot;. It emphasises worship, discipleship, missions, and social action. Alove is a member of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS).

=== Work Against Exploitation ===
The Salvation Army works with a specialist team in partnership with the UK service &quot;Modern Slavery Helpline&quot; (telephone 0800 0121 700) to help people who have been exploited for labor or profits. The organisation also assists homeless people by running 461 hostels and 20 refugee programmes.

=== COVID-19 relief ===
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, The Salvation Army donated 224,603,024 meals and 1,822,412 personal protective equipment supply kits in the United States.

==History==
The Salvation Army was founded in London&#x27;s East End in 1865 by one-time Methodist Reform Church minister William Booth and his wife Catherine Booth as the East London Christian Mission, and this name was used until 1878. The name &quot;The Salvation Army&quot; developed from an incident on 19 and 20 May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, &quot;We are a volunteer army.&quot; Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, &quot;Volunteer! I&#x27;m no volunteer, I&#x27;m a regular!&quot; Railton was instructed to cross out the word &quot;volunteer&quot; and substitute the word &quot;salvation&quot;. The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own hymns, often with words set to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; would wear the Army&#x27;s own uniform for meetings and ministry work. He became the &quot;General&quot; and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as &quot;officers&quot;. Other members became &quot;soldiers&quot;.
When William Booth became known as the General, Catherine was known as the &quot;Mother of The Salvation Army&quot;. William was motivated to convert poor Londoners such as prostitutes, gamblers, and alcoholics to Christianity, while Catherine spoke to wealthier people, gaining financial support for their work. She also acted as a religious minister, which was unusual at the time. The Foundation Deed of the Christian Mission states that women had the same rights to preach as men. William Booth described the organisation&#x27;s approach: &quot;The three &#x27;S&#x27;s&#x27; best expressed the way in which the Army administered to the &#x27;down and outs&#x27;: first, soup; second, soap; and finally, salvation.&quot;

In 1880, the Salvation Army started work in three other countries: Australia, Ireland, and the United States. Salvationists set out for the U.S. in 1880. George Scott Railton and his team started work in Harry Hill&#x27;s Variety Theatre on 14 March 1880. The first notable convert was Ashbarrel Jimmie who had so many convictions for drunkenness that the judge sentenced him to attend the Salvation Army. The corps in New York were founded as a result of Jimmys&#x27; rehabilitation. It was not always an Officer of The Salvation Army who started the Salvation Army in a new country; sometimes Salvationists emigrated to countries and started operating as &quot;the Salvation Army&quot; on their own authority. When the first official officers arrived in Australia and the United States, they found groups of Salvationists already waiting for them and started working with each other. The Army&#x27;s organised social work began in Australia on 8 December 1883 with the establishment of a home for ex-convicts.

In 1891, William Booth established a farm colony in Hadleigh, Essex, which allowed people to escape the overcrowded slums in London&#x27;s East End. A fully working farm with its own market-gardens, orchards, and milk production, it provided training in basic building trades and household work.

The Salvation Army&#x27;s main converts were at first alcoholics, morphine addicts, prostitutes, and other &quot;undesirables&quot; unwelcome in polite Christian society, which helped prompt the Booths to start their own church. The Booths did not include the use of sacraments (mainly baptism and Holy Communion) in the Army&#x27;s form of worship, believing that many Christians had come to rely on the outward signs of spiritual grace rather than on grace itself. Other beliefs are that its members should completely refrain from drinking alcohol (Holy Communion is not practised), smoking, taking illegal drugs, and gambling. Its soldiers wear a uniform tailored to the country in which they work; the uniform can be white, grey, navy, or fawn and are even styled like a sari in some areas. Any member of the public is welcome to attend their meetings.

As the Salvation Army grew rapidly in the late 19th century, it generated opposition in England. Opponents, grouped under the name of the Skeleton Army, disrupted Salvation Army meetings and gatherings with tactics such as throwing rocks, bones, rats, and tar and physical assaults on members of the Salvation Army. Much of this was led by pub owners who were losing business because of the Army&#x27;s opposition to alcohol and its targeting of the frequenters of saloons and public houses.

In 1882, the Salvation Army was established in Asia with the first outpost in India. The Army also established outposts in Australia in 1879, Japan in 1895, and China in 1915.
The Salvation Army&#x27;s reputation in the United States improved as a result of its disaster relief efforts following the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Today, in the U.S. alone, over 25,000 volunteer bell ringers with red kettles are stationed near retail stores during the weeks preceding Christmas for fundraising. The church remains a highly visible and sometimes controversial presence in many parts of the world.

The Salvation Army was one of the original six organisations that made up the USO, along with the YMCA, YWCA, National Catholic Community Services, National Jewish Welfare Board, and National Travelers Aid Association.

National Salvation Army week was created by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on 24 November 1954, encouraging people to honour the Salvation Army for its work in the United States throughout the past seventy-five years.

===History of Doughnut Day===
In 1917, over 250 Salvation Army volunteers went to soldiers&#x27; camps in France during World War I to provide supplies and baked goods, including doughnuts, to soldiers. The women who served doughnuts to the troops fried them in soldiers&#x27; helmets. They were known as &quot;Doughnut Lassies&quot; and are credited with popularising doughnuts in the United States. National Doughnut Day is now celebrated in the United States on the first Friday of June every year, a tradition that started in Chicago in 1938, to honour those who served doughnuts to soldiers during World War I.

===Salvation Navy===
In 1911, New York City architect Bradford Gilbert donated a yacht, &quot;The Jerry McAuley&quot;, to the Salvation Army. Jerry McAuley was a reformed criminal who founded the McAuley Water Street Mission (now the New York City Rescue Mission) in Lower Manhattan; he was also Mrs. Gilbert&#x27;s first husband. This 35-foot powerboat with two cabins was the first vessel in the Salvation Navy in America; there were already two or three such vessels in Scandinavia. Its purpose is &quot;to cruise the Atlantic coast, north in the summer and south in the winter, doing missionary work among the seamen of the ports.&quot; There was a six person crew; the captain was evangelist Major Nils Erikson.

=== Safeguarding Work ===
The involvement of the Salvation Army in work to combat slavery and human trafficking can be traced back to William Booth publishing a letter in &quot;The War Cry&quot; in 1885. The same year an escapee from a prostitution house arrived at the door of the Salvation Army headquarters and sought help from Bramwell Booth.

An early precursor to the Salvation Army becoming involved in safeguarding work was Catherine Booth writing to Queen Victoria regarding a Parliamentary bill for the protection of girls. Safeguarding legislation was strengthened by a new act of Parliament, the &quot;Public General Act, an Act to make further provision for the protection of women and girls, the suppression of brothels, and other purposes, (otherwise known as the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885)&quot;, which received Royal Assent on 14 August 1885 The Salvation Army was involved in getting this Act passed. Its work included a petition (numbering 340,000 signatures, deposited on the floor of the House of Commons by eight uniformed Salvationists), mass meetings, and an investigation into child prostitution. W.T. Stead of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; launched a campaign in 1885 by writing articles on &quot;The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon&quot; to expose the extent of child prostitution, which involved procuring a girl, Eliza, for £5. She was cared for by the Army, taken to France, and subsequently testified as a key witness at the trial of Stead and Rebecca Jarrett (the prostitute who had arranged the &quot;sale&quot; of Eliza) at Bow Street. Both were sentenced to six months in prison.

The newly founded Salvation Army in Japan also encountered child prostitution, derived from a system of &quot;Debt Bondage&quot;. An imperial ordinance (written in classical Japanese which few could understand) declared the girls&#x27; right to freedom; the pioneer Salvationist Gunpei Yamamuro rewrote it in colloquial speech. His wife Kiye took charge of a girls&#x27; home to provide accommodation for any girl wishing to give up prostitution. An imperial ordinance passed on 2 October 1900 stated that any woman who wished to give up prostitution only had to go to the nearest police station and ask.

==Organisational structure==

The Salvation Army operates in 133 countries. The General is the head of the Salvation Army. The organisation divides itself geographically into five zones: Americas and Caribbean, Europe, South Asia, South Pacific and East Asia, and Africa. The &quot;zonal departments&quot; at International Headquarters in London, United Kingdom, are the head of global territories and commands.

Each territory is further divided into territories, which are then sub-divided into divisions. Some territories cover several countries (like Italy and Greece) while some countries may have several territories (e.g. &quot;Australia Eastern&quot; and &quot;Australia Southern&quot;) In larger areas, regional and area commands exist as subdivisions of divisions. Each territory has an administrative hub known as territorial headquarters (THQ). Each division has a divisional headquarters (DHQ). Each of these territories is led by a territorial commander who receives orders from the Salvation Army&#x27;s international headquarters in London.

===High Councils===

Much of what happens at the High Council is governed by British Law, as set out in the Salvation Army Acts (1931, 1963, 1968, 1980). The 2013 High Council consisted of 118 members (62 women and 56 men) made up of the Chief of Staff, all the active commissioners and territorial leaders (some territories are led by colonels), each of whom was summoned by the Chief of the Staff for the sole purpose of electing a new General.

=== Heritage Centres ===
Heritage Centres are museums run by the Salvation Army which have exhibits and historical documents related to the history and work of the organisation. Heritage Centres collect, preserve, catalogue, research, and share material about the life and work of The Salvation Army. The International Heritage Centre in London can provide details of premises in any specific territory. It also manages the Salvation Army&#x27;s archival Twitter feed.

=== Relevant legislation ===
Various Constituting Instruments apply to different aspects of the work of the Salvation Army. Legislation passed in the United Kingdom Parliament covered the following:
* The Salvation Army Act 1931 contained several provisions, firstly that the High Council be convened to elect a new General when the role became vacant, and reorganised custody of property held in charitable trust by the foundation of the Salvation Army Trustee Company being formed to hold all property previously vested in the general. Section 4 relates to a serving General giving notice of their intention to retire.
* The Salvation Army Act 1963 established a non-contributory pension fund for Officers of the Salvation Army.
* The Salvation Army Act 1968 relates to management of Salvation Army trusts.
* The Salvation Army Act 1980 revised and consolidated the constitution of the Salvation Army to continue its work.
** Schedule 1 covered the Religious Doctrines of the Army
** Schedule 2 related to Common Investment Schemes and the establishment of a Central Finance Council
** Part V covered the Election of the General

=== Membership ===
Statistics for membership from the 2018 year book, are: 111,859 employees, 17,168 Active Officers, 9,775 Retired Officers, 1,050 Cadets, 175,811 Adherents, 411,327 Junior Soldiers and 1,182,100 Senior Soldiers. Previous membership statistics (as quoted from 2010 year book) include 16,938 active and 9,190 retired officers, 39,071 Corps Cadets and more than 4.5 million volunteers. Members of the Salvation Army also include &quot;adherents&quot;; these are people who do not make the commitment to be a soldier but who recognise the Salvation Army as their church. (According to the 2006 Salvation Army year book, in the United States there are 85,148 senior soldiers and 28,377 junior soldiers, 17,396 adherents and around 60,000 employees.)

=== Leadership ===
General Lyndon Buckingham has been the world leader of the Salvation Army since 3 August 2023.

=== International Congress of the Salvation Army ===
The International Congress of the Salvation Army is normally held every ten years as a conference for all Salvationists from around the world to meet. The first such conference took place in London, U.K., from 28 May to 4 June 1886, and subsequent Congressional meetings were held sporadically until 1904 and then 1990. The seventh International Congress in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, from 28 June to 2 July 2000, was the first held outside of the U.K. The latest International Congress was held in London on 1–5 July 2015, in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Salvation Army&#x27;s founding.

=== Presence in Russia ===
In Russia the Army was founded around 1917 and it struggled until 1922 at which point the situation had become extremely challenging. A Moscow court ruled that the Salvation Army was a paramilitary organisation subject to expulsion. In October 2006, the European Court of Human Rights ruled the decision illegal. The Salvation Army International website lists the Russian Federation as part of the Territory of Eastern Europe.

=== Presence in China ===
William Booth&#x27;s dying wish for the Salvation Army to be established in China was taken up in a pledge made in 1912 by Bramwell Booth to his father. In 1915 the first officers were sent, and during the 1931 famine fed 100,000 people daily. Following political difficulties by 1952 the Army withdrew from the country but work still continues in Macau and Hong Kong, and in Taiwan.

==Symbols==
===Flag===

The Salvation Army flag is a symbol of the Army&#x27;s war against sin and social evils. The red on the flag symbolises the blood of Jesus Christ, the yellow for the fire of the Holy Spirit, and the blue for purity and God.

===Crest===

The oldest official emblem of The Salvation Army is the crest. In 1878 Captain W.H. Ebdon suggested a logo, and in 1879 it was to be found on the letterhead of the Salvation Army Headquarters. The captain&#x27;s suggested design was changed only slightly and a crown was added.

The Army&#x27;s crest contains Biblical references though its symbolism:

===Red Shield===
The Red Shield has its origins in Salvation Army work during wartime. At the end of the 19th century, Staff-Captain Mary Murray was sent by William Booth to support British troops serving in the Boer War in South Africa. Then, in 1901, this same officer was given the task of establishing the Naval and Military League, the forerunner of the Red Shield Services.
Salvation Army officers serving in the Red Shield Services in wartime performed many functions. The Doughnut Girls of World War I are an early example, who served refreshments to troops in the trenches. They also provided first aid stations, ambulances, chaplaincy, social clubs, Christian worship, and other front-line services.

This symbol is still used in Blue Shield Services that serve the British Armed Forces but it is widely used as a simple, more readily identifiable symbol in many Salvation Army settings. It is common to see the Red Shield used on a casual Salvation Army uniform. It is now official Salvation Army policy in the U.K. that the red shield should be used as the external symbol of the Salvation Army, with the Crest only being used internally. Therefore, any new Salvation Army building will now have the red shield on the outside rather than the crest which certainly would have been used on its Corps (church) buildings. This was &quot;imposed&quot; in the U.K. by the Senior Management with little or no consultation with members. Not all have welcomed this change.

===Uniform===

Salvation Army officers, cadets (trainee officers) and soldiers often wear uniforms. The idea that they should do so originated with Elijah Cadman, who, at the Salvation Army&#x27;s &quot;War Congress&quot; in August 1878, said, &quot;I would like to wear a suit of clothes that would let everyone know I meant war to the teeth and salvation for the world&quot;. The uniform identifies the wearer as a Salvationist and a Christian. It also symbolises availability to those in need. The uniform takes many forms internationally but is characterised by the &quot;S&quot; insignia for &quot;Salvation&quot; and carries the meaning &quot;Saved to Serve&quot;, or &quot;Saved to Save&quot;. Different colours and styles represent different ranks including soldiers, cadets, lieutenants, captains, majors, colonels, commissioner, and General.

Characteristics of the uniform vary between ranks where accessories (the official term is &quot;trimmings&quot;) consist of epaulettes and hexagonal lapel patches.
The uniform varies with the position and rank:
* Soldier: plain black epaulettes (Corps name woven into base of epaulette) and black lapel patch with &quot;S&quot;
* Musician: plain blue or black epaulettes and lapel patch with &quot;S&quot;
* Cadet: black epaulette with 1 or 2 red bars corresponding to number of years of training and black lapel patch with &quot;S&quot;
* Officer ranks:
** Lieutenant: red epaulette with one silver star and red lapel patch with &quot;S&quot;
** Captain: red epaulette with two silver stars and red lapel patch with &quot;S&quot;
** Major: red epaulette with silver crest and red lapel patch with &quot;S&quot;

Other letters are substituted to conform with local language. The words &quot;The Salvation Army&quot; are woven into the fabric of the uniform as a logo on shirts, blouses, and jackets.

===Tartan===

Since 1983 there has been an official Salvation Army tartan. It was designed by Captain Harry Cooper, for the Perth Citadel Corps centenary commemoration in Scotland. It is based upon the colours of the Salvation Army flag, with which it shares the same symbolism. It is rarely seen outside Scotland.

===Salute===
The Salvation Army has a unique form of salute which involves raising the right hand above shoulder-height with the index finger pointing upwards. It signifies recognition of a fellow citizen of heaven, and a pledge to do everything possible to get others to heaven also. A Salvationist who salutes in this manner in response to applause, signifies that he or she wishes to give Glory to God and not themselves. In some instances, the salute is accompanied with a shout of &quot;hallelujah!&quot;

===Red kettles===

In many countries, the Salvation Army is recognised during the Christmas season as its volunteers and employees stand outside of businesses and play/sing Christmas carols, or ring bells to inspire passers-by to place donations of cash and cheques inside red kettles. A tradition has developed in the United States in which, in some places, gold coins or rings or bundles of large bills are anonymously inserted into the kettles. This was first recorded in 1982, in Crystal Lake, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. Red kettles are not only used during the Christmas season, but throughout the year at other fundraising events, such as on National Doughnut Day in the U.S. On this day, some doughnut shops that teamed up with the Salvation Army have a red kettle set up for donations. Each corps has a monetary goal chosen for them by Divisional Headquarters, which differs based on size and capability.

===Red Shield Appeal and Self-Denial Appeal===
The Red Shield Appeal and Self-Denial Appeal are annual fundraising campaigns in some territories, such as the U.K. and Australia. Each year, officers, soldiers, employees, and volunteers take to the streets worldwide to participate in door-to-door or street collections. The money raised is channelled towards The Salvation Army&#x27;s social work in each respective territory. Within the territory defined by the United Kingdom and Ireland (UKIT) this collection is known as the Annual Appeal, and it often carries another name that the general public would more readily know—in 2012 it became The Big Collection.

===Music playing===
As the popularity of the organisation grew and Salvationists worked the streets of London attempting to convert individuals, they were sometimes confronted with unruly crowds. A family of musicians (the Frys, from Alderbury, Wiltshire) began working with the Army as their &quot;bodyguards&quot; and played music to distract the crowds. In 1891, a Salvation Army band attempted to parade and play music in Eastbourne, Sussex, England. This was in contravention of local by-laws and resulted in the arrest of nine Salvationists. Unperturbed the Army continued to parade in defiance of the law, with the aim of gathering support for a change in legislation. Over the next few months the situation in the town escalated to such an extent that there were riots, and mounted police had to be called in from surrounding areas to try to maintain order.

The tradition of having musicians available continued and eventually grew into standard brass bands. These are still seen in public at Army campaigns, and at other festivals, parades, and at Christmas. Across the world the brass band has been part of the Army&#x27;s ministry and an immediately recognisable symbol to Salvationists and non-Salvationists alike. The Salvation Army also has choirs; these are known as Songster Brigades, normally comprising the traditional soprano, alto, tenor, and bass singers. The premier Songster Brigade in the Salvation Army is the International Staff Songsters (ISS). The standard of playing is high and the Army operates bands at the international level—such as the International Staff Band (a brass band) which is the equal of professional ensembles although it does not participate in the brass band contest scene—and territorial levels such as the New York Staff Band. Some professional brass players and contesting brass band personnel have Salvation Army backgrounds. Many Salvation Army corps have brass bands that play at Salvation Army meetings, although not all. The Salvation Army also fielded large concertina bands. From the turn of the (20th) century to the Second World War between a third and a half of all SA officers in Britain played concertina. For an evangelist, the concertina&#x27;s portability, its ability to play both melody and chords, and most especially the fact that the player can sing or speak while playing, were all distinct advantages over brass instruments.

The Army tradition in music is to use the popular idiom of the day to reach people for Jesus. The Army&#x27;s Joy Strings were a hit pop group in the 1960s and early 1970s in the U.K. and beyond, reaching the charts and being featured on national television. Another popular band is The Insyderz, an American ska-core group popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. Hundreds of bands carry on this Salvation Army tradition, such as New Zealand&#x27;s Moped, Chamberlain, Vatic, Agent C, and The Lads; England&#x27;s Electralyte; Australia&#x27;s Soteria Music Ministries, Summer Carnival Band, Crown of Thorns and Escape; and America&#x27;s transMission, The Singing Company, HAB, BurN, and CJD – Cookies, Juice, &amp; Donuts. Saytunes is a website designed to encourage and promote these contemporary Salvation Army bands and artists. Another significant musical feature of the Salvation Army is its use of tambourines with colourised ribbons representing the colours of the Salvation Army flag. They are mainly played by women.

==Publications==
The Salvation Army publishes books, magazines, and sheet music. Due to the way in which the Salvation Army is constituted, copyright of some Army publications is vested in the General of The Salvation Army, and not necessarily the original authors.

There are official social media accounts run by the Salvation Army on Twitter, Facebook groups run by Territories and Corps officers, and unofficial fan groups.

== Public views ==
In 1994, the &quot;Chronicle of Philanthropy&quot;, an industry publication, released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organisation popularity and credibility. The study showed that The Salvation Army was ranked as the 4th &quot;most popular charity/non-profit in America&quot; of over 100 charities researched, with 47% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing &#x27;Love&#x27; and &#x27;Like A Lot&#x27; for The Salvation Army.

==Honours==

General Bramwell Booth instituted the &quot;Order of the Founder&quot; on 20 August 1917. The first awards were made in 1920 to one Soldier and 15 Officers. General George Carpenter founded the &quot;Order of Distinguished Auxiliary Service&quot; in 1941 to express the Salvation Army&#x27;s gratitude for service given to the organisation by non-Salvationists.

==Controversies==
===Stance on LGBT rights===
Because the Salvation Army is a church, Title VII of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964 allows it to inquire into people&#x27;s religious beliefs in its hiring practices. The Salvation Army states that it does not &quot;discriminate against hiring gays and lesbians for the majority of its roughly 55,000 jobs,&quot; but has historically supported legislation which would allow it to deny employment and federally-funded services to LGBT individuals.
In 1986, The Salvation Army campaigned throughout New Zealand against the Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986, which decriminalised homosexuality. In 2006, the Army released a statement regretting the ill feelings that persisted following its activity. It stated in part &quot;We do understand though that The Salvation Army&#x27;s official opposition to the Reform Bill was deeply hurtful to many, and are distressed that ill-feeling still troubles our relationship with segments of the gay community. We regret any hurt that may remain from that turbulent time and our present hope is to rebuild bridges of understanding and dialogue between our movement and the gay community.&quot;

In 1997, the city of San Francisco enacted a law requiring all companies doing business with the city government to extend domestic benefits to same-sex partners of employees. In refusing to do so, the Salvation Army declined a US$3.5 million contract. In 2001, the Salvation Army pressed the Bush Administration to exempt it and other religious groups from anti-discrimination legislation which it felt infringed on the organisation&#x27;s religious freedoms. This request was denied, and was sharply rebuked by David Smith, then-spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign. &quot;Gays and lesbians are taxpayers, too,&quot; said Smith. &quot;Their money should not be used by religious groups to fund discriminatory practices against them.&quot;

In February 2000, the Salvation Army in the United Kingdom publicly opposed the repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which prevented local authorities from &quot;intentionally promot[ing] homosexuality&quot;.

The Salvation Army Western Territory approved a plan in October 2001 to start offering domestic partnership benefits to employees in same-sex relationships. Members of various evangelical Christian interest groups protested the decision. Focus on the Family founder James Dobson excoriated the Salvation Army for abandoning its &quot;moral integrity&quot; and urged his radio listeners to bombard the organisation&#x27;s offices with phone calls and letters. The American Family Association also accused the Salvation Army of a &quot;monstrous... appeasement of sin&quot; that resulted in a &quot;betrayal of the church&quot;. In November 2001 the Salvation Army US-wide rescinded the Western Territory&#x27;s decision with an announcement that it would only provide benefits coverage for different-sex spouses and dependent children of its employees.

In 2004, the Salvation Army said that it would close operations in New York City unless it was exempted from a municipal ordinance requiring them to offer benefits to gay employees&#x27; partners. The City Council refused to make the exemption. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg&#x27;s administration chose not to enforce the ordinance. The administration&#x27;s right to decline to enforce the ordinance was upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals in 2006.

In 2008, a trans woman named Jennifer Gale died outside a church in Austin, Texas. A city council member attributed her death to workers at a Salvation Army shelter refusing to house her in the women&#x27;s quarters. The city council member later partially retracted their statements, stating &quot;The Salvation Army... do apparently have a policy of non-discrimination and they do not turn trans people away, but I&#x27;m not fully sold on their ability to actually understand the issue. If they are not full they will give trans people privacy (maybe they have private quarters of some sort), but if full and they are in an overflow shelter situation, as they were Tuesday night, I am under the impression that they will assign people according to their anatomy.&quot;

Between 2010 and 2013, a &quot;position statement&quot; with regard to &quot;same-sex&quot; &quot;sexual orientations&quot; was published on the Salvation Army&#x27;s website:

Scripture forbids sexual intimacy between members of the same sex. The Salvation Army believes, therefore, that Christians whose sexual orientation is primarily or exclusively same-sex are called upon to embrace celibacy as a way of life. There is no scriptural support for same-sex unions as equal to, or as an alternative to, heterosexual marriage.

Likewise, there is no scriptural support for demeaning or mistreating anyone for reason of his or her sexual orientation. The Salvation Army opposes any such abuse.

In keeping with these convictions, the services of The Salvation Army are available to all who qualify, without regard to sexual orientation.

This position statement was deleted by June 2012, replaced by a statement that the organisation&#x27;s position on homosexuality is under review.

On 15 December 2012, in Canada, Andrea Le Good noticed a Salvation Army bell-ringer carrying a sign reading &quot;if you support gay rights: please do not donate&quot;. While the bell-ringer claimed he had permission from the charity to wear the sign, Salvation Army spokeswoman Kyla Ferns said that it had no part in the sign, and that the bell-ringer was pulled away immediately when the charity learned about it.

In November 2013, it was made known that the Salvation Army was referring LGBT individuals to one of several conversion therapy groups. As a response, the Salvation Army removed links to the conversion groups from their website.

In 2016, The Salvation Army withdrew support for an Australian safe schools program that focused on LGBT students, stating that &quot;the provision of a government approved anti-bullying program needs to consider all high risk student groups.&quot;

In November 2019, according to &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, &quot;singer Ellie Goulding... threaten[ed] to cancel her performance at the Cowboys&#x27; Thanksgiving halftime show&quot; out of concern for &quot;the LGBTQ community&quot; following negative responses to an Instagram post that she made promoting the organisation:

&quot;Upon researching this, I have reached out to The Salvation Army and said that I would have no choice but to pull out unless they very quickly make a solid, committed pledge or donation to the LGBTQ community,&quot; she wrote. &quot;I am a committed philanthropist as you probably know, and my heart has always been in helping the homeless, but supporting an anti-LGBTQ charity is clearly not something I would ever intentionally do. Thank you for drawing my attention to this.&quot;

The show &quot;serves as the kickoff for the Salvation Army&#x27;s yearly Red Kettle Campaign&quot;. Goulding later opted to perform.

In 2019, 2020, and 2021, The Salvation Army continued to be criticized in publications like &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;Out&quot;, for homophobic and transphobic views and practices expressed by its leaders and policies, such as in public statements and lobbying.

====The Salvation Army&#x27;s response====
In 2013, a positional statement on the Salvation Army U.K. and Ireland site stated:

The statement was later taken down. The statement was intended explicitly for members of the Salvation Army and the Salvation Army mission statement states:

, activists were still calling on the Salvation Army to change its stance on LGBT issues, citing ongoing discrimination.

, the &quot;Inclusion&quot; page on the official U.K. website stated that the Salvation Army stands against homophobia and does not permit discrimination in its employment practices or delivery of care.

, the U.S.A. Central Territory website explicitly states that it serves and welcomes the LGBT community.

On the website of its USA division, the organisation currently maintains an informative/promotional document titled &quot;The LGBTQ Community and The Salvation Army&quot; which states (among other things) that it is &quot;committed to serving the LGBTQ community&quot;; &quot;[w]hen a transgender person seeks help from us, we serve them in the same manner as any other person seeking assistance&quot;; it &quot;is an Equal Opportunity Employer&quot; with regard to &quot;sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression&quot; (et al.); and that it &quot;provide[s] benefits to the spouses of employees in same-sex marriages&quot;.

===Proselytising during government-funded social service in New York===
In 2004, the Salvation Army&#x27;s New York division was named in a lawsuit filed by 18 current and former employees of its social service arm, claiming that the organisation asked about the religious and sexual habits of employees in programs funded by local and state government. One member claimed the organisation forced them to agree &quot;to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ&quot;. Proselytising or otherwise pursuing religious motives in a government-funded program is generally considered a violation of the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution. While the employment-discrimination portion of the lawsuit was dismissed in 2005, government agencies agreed in a 2010 settlement to set up monitoring systems to ensure that the Army did not violate church–state separation in its publicly funded projects. The organisation did not dispute allegations that nine-year-olds in a city-funded foster care program were put through a &quot;confirmation-like&quot; ceremony, where they were given Bibles and prayed over.

===Australian sex abuse cases===

From the 1940s to the 1980s the Salvation Army in Australia sheltered approximately 30,000 children. In 2006 the Australian division of the Salvation Army acknowledged that sexual abuse may have occurred during this time and issued an apology. In it, the Army explicitly rejected a claim, made by a party unnamed in the apology, that there were as many as 500 potential claimants.

In 2013 it was reported that private settlements totalling had been made in Victoria relating to 474 abuse cases; a Salvation Army spokesman said that &quot;This should not have happened and this was a breach of the trust placed in us&quot; and that they were &quot;deeply sorry&quot; whilst claiming that the abuse was &quot;the result of individuals and not a culture within the organisation&quot;.

In 2014, the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a royal commission of inquiry initiated in 2013 by the Australian Government and supported by all of its state governments, began investigating abuse cases at the Alkira Salvation Army Home for Boys at ; the Riverview Training Farm (also known as Endeavour Training Farm) at both in Queensland; the Bexley Boys&#x27; Home at ; and the Gill Memorial Home at both in New South Wales. The investigation also examined the Salvation Army&#x27;s processes in investigating, disciplining, removing, and transferring anyone accused of or found to have engaged in child sexual abuse in these homes. On 27 March 2014, the Royal Commission began investigating the handling by the Salvation Army (Eastern Territory) of claims of child sexual abuse between 1993 and 2014.

=== Kroc Centres ===
In 2004, the Army in the United States received a US$1.6 billion donation in the will of Joan B. Kroc, the third wife of former McDonald&#x27;s CEO Ray Kroc. This donation was among the larger individual philanthropic gifts ever given to a single organisation. The donation came with certain restrictions, such as requiring the funds to be used on new rather than existing centers. As of 2023, 26 new centers were opened using these funds.

==In films==

The Salvation Army is featured in many popular movies such as &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and &quot;Major Barbara&quot;. A book detailing over 500 films in which the Salvation Army appears or is mentioned was published in 2020 entitled &quot;The Salvation Army at the Movies&quot;.

The Salvation Army began producing silent films when they started their own film studio called The Limelight Department in 1892, which was the first in Australia. The original studio still stands today and is being preserved by the Salvation Army. One of the films was a documentary called &quot;Inauguration of the Australian Commonwealth&quot;. In the years between 1898 and 1909, The Limelight Department produced over 300 films and documented Australia&#x27;s Federation Ceremonies in 1909.

<text>The Charter of the United Nations (UN) is the foundational treaty of the United Nations. It establishes the purposes, governing structure, and overall framework of the UN system, including its six principal organs: the Secretariat, the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the International Court of Justice, and the Trusteeship Council.

The UN Charter mandates the UN and its member states to maintain international peace and security, uphold international law, achieve &quot;higher standards of living&quot; for their citizens, address &quot;economic, social, health, and related problems&quot;, and promote &quot;universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion&quot;. As a charter and constituent treaty, its rules and obligations are binding on all members and supersede those of other treaties.

During the Second World War, the Allies—formally known as the United Nations—agreed to establish a new postwar international organization. Pursuant to this goal, the UN Charter was discussed, prepared, and drafted during the San Francisco Conference that began 25 April 1945, which involved most of the world&#x27;s sovereign nations. Following two-thirds approval of each part, the final text was unanimously adopted by delegates and opened for signature on 26 June 1945; it was signed in San Francisco, United States, by 50 of the 51 original member countries.

The Charter entered into force on 24 October 1945, following ratification by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and a majority of the other signatories; this is considered the official starting date of the United Nations, with the first session of the General Assembly, representing all 51 initial members, opening in London the following January. The General Assembly formally recognized 24 October as United Nations Day in 1947, and declared it an official international holiday in 1971. With 193 parties, most countries have now ratified the Charter.

==Summary==

The Charter consists of a &quot;preamble&quot; and 111 articles grouped into 19 chapters.

The preamble consists of two principal parts. The first part contains a general call for the maintenance of peace and international security and respect for human rights. The second part of the preamble is a declaration in a contractual style that the governments of the peoples of the United Nations have agreed to the Charter and it is the first international document regarding human rights.
* Chapter I sets forth the purposes of the United Nations, including the important provisions of the maintenance of international peace and security.
* Chapter II defines the criteria for membership in the United Nations.
* Chapters III–XV, the bulk of the document, describe the organs and institutions of the UN and their respective powers.
* Chapters XVI and Chapter XVII describe arrangements for integrating the UN with established international law.
* Chapters XVIII and Chapter XIX provide for amendment and ratification of the Charter.

The following chapters deal with the enforcement powers of UN bodies:
* Chapter VI describes the Security Council&#x27;s power to investigate and mediate disputes;
* Chapter VII describes the Security Council&#x27;s power to authorize economic, diplomatic, and military sanctions, as well as the use of military force, to resolve disputes;
* Chapter VIII makes it possible for regional arrangements to maintain peace and security within their own region;
* Chapters IX and Chapter X describe the UN&#x27;s powers for economic and social cooperation, and the Economic and Social Council that oversee these powers;
* Chapters XII and Chapter XIII describe the Trusteeship Council, which oversaw decolonization;
* Chapters XIV and Chapter XV establish the powers of, respectively, the International Court of Justice and the United Nations Secretariat.
* Chapters XVI through Chapter XIX deal respectively with XVI: miscellaneous provisions, XVII: transitional security arrangements related to World War II, XVIII: the charter amendment process, and XIX: ratification of the charter

== History ==

=== Background ===
The principles and conceptual framework of the United Nations were formulated incrementally through a series of conferences by the Allied nations during the Second World War. The Declaration of St James&#x27;s Palace, issued in London on 12 June 1941, was the first joint statement of the declared goals and principles of the Allies, and the first to express a vision for a postwar world order. The Declaration called for the &quot;willing cooperation of free peoples&quot; so that &quot;all may enjoy economic and social security&quot;.

Roughly two months later, the United States and the United Kingdom issued a joint, eight-point statement elaborating such goals, known as the Atlantic Charter. It set out (1) that these countries do not seek aggrandizement, (2) that no territorial changes be made against the wishes of the people, (2) the right to self-determination for all peoples, (3) restoration of self-government to those deprived of it, (4) furtherance of access for all states to trade and raw materials &quot;needed for their economic prosperity&quot;, (5) global cooperation to secure better economic and social conditions for the world, (5) the &quot;destruction of the Nazi tyranny&quot; and freedom from fear and want, (7) freedom of the seas, and (8) &quot;abandonment of the use of force&quot; by disarming nations of &quot;aggression&quot; and establishing a wider Anglo-American world &quot;security system&quot; under mutual disarmament after the war. Many of these principles would inspire or form part of the UN Charter.

The following year, on 1 January 1942, representatives of thirty nations formally at war with the Axis powers—led by the &quot;Big Four&quot; powers of China, the Soviet Union, the U.K., and the U.S.—signed the Declaration by United Nations, which formalized the anti-Axis alliance and reaffirmed the purposes and principles of the Atlantic Charter. The following day, representatives of twenty-two other nations added their signatures. The term &quot;United Nations&quot; became synonymous with the Allies for the duration of the war, and was considered the formal name under which they were fighting. The Declaration by United Nations formed the basis of the United Nations Charter; virtually all nations that acceded to it would be invited to take part in the 1945 San Francisco Conference to discuss and prepare the Charter.

On 30 October 1943, the Declaration of the Four Nations, one of the four Moscow Declarations, was signed by the foreign ministers of the Big Four, calling for the establishment of a &quot;general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all peace-loving states, and open to membership by all such states, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and security.&quot; This was the first formal announcement that a new international organization was being contemplated to replace the moribund League of Nations.

Pursuant to the Moscow Declarations, from 21 August 1944 to 7 October 1944, the U.S. hosted the Dumbarton Oaks Conference to develop a blueprint for what would become the United Nations. Many of the rules, principles, and provisions of the UN Charter were proposed during the conference, including the structure of the UN system; the creation of a &quot;Security Council&quot; to prevent future war and conflict; and the establishment of other &quot;organs&quot; of the organization, such as the General Assembly, International Court of Justice, and Secretariat. The conference was led by the Big Four, with delegates from other nation participating in the consideration and formulation of these principles. At the Paris peace conference in 1919, it was Prime Minister Jan Smuts of South Africa and Lord Cecil of the United Kingdom who came up with the structure of the League of Nations with the League being divided into a League Assembly consisting of all the member states and a League Council consisting of the great powers. The same design that Smuts and Cecil had devised for the League of Nations was copied for the United Nations with a Security Council made up of the great powers and a General Assembly of the UN member states.

The subsequent Yalta Conference in February 1945 between the U.S., U.K., and Soviet Union resolved the lingering debate regarding the voting structure of the proposed Security Council, calling for a &quot;Conference of United Nations&quot; in San Francisco on 25 April 1945 to &quot;prepare the charter of such an organization, along the lines proposed in the formal conversations of Dumbarton Oaks.&quot;

=== Drafting and adoption ===

The San Francisco Conference, formally the United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO), began as scheduled on 25 April 1945 with the goal of drafting a charter that would create a new international organization. The Big Four, which sponsored the event, invited all forty-six signatories to the Declaration by United Nations. Conference delegates invited four more nations: the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, Argentina and recently liberated Denmark.

The conference was perhaps the largest international gathering up to that point, with 850 delegates, along with advisers and organizers, for a total of 3,500 participants. An additional 2,500 representatives from media and various civil society groups were also in attendance. Plenary meetings involving all delegates were chaired on a rotational basis by the lead delegates of the Big Four. Several committees were formed to facilitate and address different aspects of the drafting process, with over 400 meetings convened in the subsequent weeks. Following multiple reviews, debates, and revisions, a final full meeting was held on 25 June 1945 with the final proposed draft posed to attendees. Following unanimous approval, the Charter was signed by delegates the following day in Veterans&#x27; Memorial Hall.

The United States Senate, as part of the 79th United States Congress, ratified the Charter by a vote of 892 on 28 July 1945. By 24 October 1945, enough nations had ratified the Charter to officially bring the United Nations into existence.

<text>Joint Vision 2020 was a document released on May 30, 2000, by the United States Department of Defense proclaiming the need for &quot;full-spectrum dominance&quot; on the battlefield. The Joint Vision 2020 concepts have subsequently formed the basis of United States military doctrine.

The document envisages the military threats that might confront the United States in the year 2020 and possible responses to these threats. Information operations were a primary focus of the document, as well as the rapidly-accelerating pace of technological development.

<doc id="88811" wikidata="Q874031" url="?curid=88811" title="Braunschweiger (sausage)">
<text>Braunschweiger (, named after Braunschweig, Germany) is a type of sausage. The type of sausage the term refers to varies by region. In the German language, &quot;Braunschweiger&quot; is the demonym for people from Brunswick (German name &quot;Braunschweig&quot;), but under German food law refers to a variety of mettwurst. In Austria, Braunschweiger is known as a type of parboiled sausage (&quot;Brühwurst&quot;), while American Braunschweiger is often confused with liverwurst.

==Germany==
&quot;Braunschweiger Mettwurst&quot; is a smoked, soft and spreadable sausage usually made from raw minced pork and spiced with garlic, salt and pepper. Produced by Brunswick butchers as a regional speciality since the early 19th century, it became widespread with the advent of food preservation by canning. Several different recipes exist, some also including beef and fat.

==Austria==
In Austria, Braunschweiger is a Brühwurst variant which is similar to Jagdwurst (&quot;hunting sausage&quot;), made with a mixture of pork and beef, bacon and nitrite curing salt. This type of sausage is usually eaten between meals.

==North America==

In the United States and Canada, Braunschweiger refers to a type of pork liver sausage which, if stuffed in natural casings, is almost always smoked. Commercial products often contain smoked bacon, and are stuffed into fibrous casings. Liverwurst (another type of pork liver sausage), however, is never smoked, nor does it contain bacon.

The USDA requires that the product contain a minimum of 30% liver. A typical commercial formula is about 40% pork liver or scalded beef liver, 30% scalded pork jowl, 20% lean pork trimmings and 10% bacon ends and pieces. Added seasonings include salt and often include white pepper, onion powder or chopped onion, and mace. Curing ingredients (sodium erythorbate and sodium nitrite) are optional.

Braunschweiger has a very high amount of vitamin A, iron, protein and fat. The meat has a very soft, spread-like texture and a distinctive spicy liver-based flavor, very similar to the Nordic &quot;leverpostej&quot;. It is usually used as a spread for toast, but can also be used as a filling for sandwiches, often paired with stone-ground mustard, sliced tomato, onion and cheese. In the Midwestern United States, braunschweiger is typically eaten in a sandwich with various condiments such as ketchup, mustard, and dill pickles, or simply spread on crackers. There are also a few recipes for pâté and cheese balls which use braunschweiger as a primary ingredient. However, pâté is creamier than braunschweiger.

<doc id="88813" wikidata="Q623553" url="?curid=88813" title="Tweety">
<text>Tweety is a yellow canary in the Warner Bros. &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of animated cartoons. His characteristics are based on Red Skelton&#x27;s famous &quot;Junior the Mean Widdle Kid&quot;. He appeared in 46 cartoons during the golden age, made between 1942 and 1964.

== Personality and identity ==
Despite the perceptions that people may hold, owing to the long eyelashes and high-pitched voice (which Mel Blanc provided), Tweety is male although his ambiguity was played with. For example, in the cartoon &quot;Snow Business&quot;, when Granny entered a room containing Tweety and Sylvester she said: &quot;Here I am, boys!&quot;. Another confirmation that Tweety is male comes from the cartoon &quot;Greedy for Tweety&quot; in which during a hospital stay, Granny (portrayed as a nurse) utters &quot;Oh the poor little Tweety bird, let&#x27;s makes him a little more comfortable&quot;, as she adjusts his bed. Nonetheless, a 1952 cartoon was entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Tweet&quot;. Also, his species is ambiguous; although originally and often portrayed as a young canary, he is also frequently called a rare and valuable &quot;tweety bird&quot; as a plot device, and once called &quot;the only living specimen&quot;. Nevertheless, the title song of &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries&quot; directly states that he is a canary. His shape more closely suggests that of a &quot;baby&quot; bird, which is what he was during his early appearances (although the &quot;baby bird&quot; aspect has been used in a few later cartoons as a plot device). The yellow feathers were added, but otherwise he retained the baby-bird shape.

In his early appearances in Bob Clampett cartoons, Tweety is a very aggressive character who tries anything to foil his feline adversary, even kicking the cat when he is down. One example of a malicious moment is in the cartoon &quot;Birdy and the Beast&quot;, where a cat chases Tweety by flying until he remembers that cats cannot fly, causing him to fall. Tweety says sympathetically, &quot;Awww, the poor kitty cat! He faw down and go (&quot;in a loud, tough, masculine voice&quot;) BOOM!!&quot; and then grins mischievously. A similar use of that voice is in &quot;A Tale Of Two Kitties&quot; when Tweety, wearing an air raid warden&#x27;s helmet, suddenly yells &quot;Turn out those lights!&quot;

Tweety&#x27;s aggressive nature was also initially characterized by Friz Freleng when he began directing the series, but would later be toned-down to instead have him be portrayed as a cutesy bird usually going about his business, and doing little to thwart Sylvester&#x27;s ill-conceived plots, allowing them to simply collapse on their own; he became even less aggressive when Granny was introduced, but occasionally Tweety still showed a malicious side when egged on. Despite this, in comparison with other major &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; protagonists such as Bugs Bunny and Foghorn Leghorn, Tweety was not given a complete character arc, instead embodying the &quot;innocent child&quot; role offsetting the motives of his superior Sylvester and their guardian figure.

== Creation by Bob Clampett ==

Bob Clampett created the character that would become Tweety in the 1942 short &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot;, pitting him against two hungry cats named Babbit and Catstello (based on the famous comedians Abbott and Costello). On the original model sheet, Tweety was named Orson, which was also the name of a bird character from an earlier Clampett cartoon &quot;Wacky Blackout&quot;.

Tweety was created not as a domestic canary, but as a generic (and wild) baby bird in an outdoor nest: naked (pink), jowly, and also far more aggressive and saucy, as opposed to the later, better-known version of him as a less hot-tempered (but still somewhat ornery) yellow canary. In the documentary &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot;, animator Clampett stated that Tweety had been based &quot;on my own naked baby picture.&quot; Clampett did two more shorts with the &quot;naked genius&quot;, as a Jimmy Durante-ish cat once called him in &quot;A Gruesome Twosome&quot;. The second Tweety short, &quot;Birdy and the Beast&quot;, finally bestowed the baby bird with his new name, and gave him his blue eyes. After the first three cartoons, censors declared that the character was nude, and they made the studio paint him yellow to make it look as if he was covered in feathers.

Many of Mel Blanc&#x27;s characters are known for speech impediments. One of Tweety&#x27;s most noticeable is that /s/, /k/, and /g/ are changed to /t/, /d/, or (final s) /θ/; for example, &quot;pussy cat&quot; comes out as &quot;putty tat&quot;, later rendered &quot;puddy tat&quot;, &quot;Granny&quot; comes out as &quot;Dwanny&quot; and &quot;sweetie pie&quot; comes out as &quot;tweetie pie&quot; (a phonological pattern referred to as &#x27;fronting&#x27;), hence his name. He also has trouble with liquid consonants: as with Elmer Fudd, /l/ and /r/ come out as /w/. In &quot;Canary Row&quot; and &quot;Putty Tat Trouble&quot;, he begins the cartoon by singing a song about himself, &quot;I&#x27;m a tweet wittow biwd in a diwded tage; Tweety&#x27;th my name but I don&#x27;t know my age, I don&#x27;t have to wuwy and dat is dat; I&#x27;m tafe in hewe fwom dat ol&#x27; putty tat&quot;. (Translation: &quot;I&#x27;m a sweet little bird in a gilded cage...&quot;) Aside from this speech impediment, Tweety&#x27;s voice is that of Bugs Bunny, one speed up (if &quot;The Old Grey Hare&quot;, which depicts Bugs as an infant, is any indication of that); the only difference is that Bugs does not have trouble pronouncing /s/, /k/ and /g/ as mentioned above.

== Freleng takes over ==
Clampett began work on a short that would pit Tweety against a then-unnamed, lisping black and white cat created by Friz Freleng in 1946. However, Clampett left the studio before going into full production on the short (which had a storyboard produced, where it was titled &quot;Fat Rat and the Stupid Cat&quot;), however Freleng would use Tweety in his own separate project. Freleng toned Tweety down and gave him a cuter appearance, resulting in his long-lashed blue-pupil eyes and yellow feathers. Clampett mentions in &quot;Bugs Bunny: Superstar&quot; that the feathers were added to satisfy censors who objected to the naked bird. The first short to team Tweety and the cat, later named Sylvester, was 1947&#x27;s &quot;Tweetie Pie&quot;, which won Warner Bros. its first Academy Award for Best Short Subject.

Sylvester and Tweety proved to be one of the most notable pairings in animation history. Most of their cartoons followed a standard formula:

* Sylvester wants to catch and eat Tweety, but some major obstacle stands in his way – usually Granny or her bulldog Hector (or occasionally, numerous bulldogs, or another cat who also wants to catch and eat Tweety).
* Tweety says his signature lines &quot;I tawt I taw a puddy tat!&quot; and &quot;I did! I did taw a puddy tat!&quot; (Originally, like in &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot;, it was &quot;I did! I taw a putty tat!&quot;, but the extra &quot;did&quot; got inserted, starting with Freleng&#x27;s first cartoon, somehow). In later cartoons, such as &quot;Home, Tweet Home&quot;, Tweety says &quot;I did! I did! I did taw a puddy tat!&quot;
* Sylvester spends the entire film using progressively more elaborate schemes or devices to catch Tweety, similar to Wile E. Coyote in his ongoing efforts to catch the Road Runner, Tom&#x27;s attempts to catch Jerry, and the Aardvark&#x27;s attempts to catch the Ant. Of course, each of his tricks fail, either due to their flaws or, more often than not, because of intervention by either Hector the Bulldog or an indignant Granny, or after Tweety steers the enemy toward them or another device (such as off the ledge of a tall building or in front of an oncoming train).

In a few of the cartoons, Sylvester does manage to briefly eat Tweety up with a gulp. However, either Granny or another character makes him spit Tweety out right away. In the 1952 Christmas-themed short &quot;Gift Wrapped&quot;, Sylvester was also briefly eaten by Hector the Bulldog, and forced by Granny to spit him out; as punishment, both Sylvester and Hector were tied up with their mouths gagged shut.

In 1951, Mel Blanc (with Billy May&#x27;s orchestra) had a hit single with &quot;I Tawt I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot;, a song performed in character by Tweety and featuring Sylvester. In the lyrics Sylvester sings &quot;I&#x27;d like to eat that Thweetie Pie when he leaves his cage&quot;, implying that Tweety&#x27;s name is actually Sweetie Pie. Later the name &quot;Sweetie Pie&quot; was applied to the young, pink female canary in the &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; animated TV series of the early 1990s.

From 1945 until the original Warner Bros. Cartoons studio closed, Freleng had almost exclusive use of Tweety at the Warner cartoon studio (much like Yosemite Sam), with the exception of a brief cameo in &quot;No Barking&quot; in 1954, directed by Chuck Jones (that year, Freleng used Pepé Le Pew, a Jones character, for the only time in his career and the only time in a Tweety short, &quot;Dog Pounded&quot;).

== Later appearances ==
Tweety had a cameo role in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, making Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) fall from a flag pole by playing &quot;This Little Piggy&quot; with Valiant&#x27;s fingers and releasing his grip. The scene is essentially a re-creation of a gag from &quot;A Tale of Two Kitties&quot;, with Valiant replacing Catstello as Tweety&#x27;s victim. This was the last time Mel Blanc voiced Tweety.

During the 1990s, Tweety also starred in the animated TV series &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;, in which Granny ran a detective agency with the assistance of Tweety, Sylvester and Hector. In the series, Tweety has the starring role and is voiced by Joe Alaskey. The storyline carries into the 2000 direct-to-video feature-length animated film &quot;Tweety&#x27;s High-Flying Adventure&quot;, where Joe Alaskey reprises his role. Tweety&#x27;s prototype, Orson, also made an appearance in the series.

Tweety also appears in &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; as the mentor of Sweetie Pie, and one of the faculty at Acme Looniversity. He was voiced by Jeff Bergman for most of his appearances and Bob Bergen in &quot;Animaniacs&quot;.

In the 1995 cartoon short &quot;Carrotblanca&quot;, a parody/homage to &quot;Casablanca&quot;, Tweety appeared as &quot;Usmarte&quot;, a parody of the character Ugarte played by Peter Lorre in the original film. In several sequences, Tweety was speaking and laughing in character like Peter Lorre. He also does the Looney Tunes ending instead of Porky Pig or Bugs Bunny. This is also notable for being a rare instance where Tweety plays a villain character. Bob Bergen voices the role again.

In 1996, Tweety (voiced by Bob Bergen again) appeared in the feature film, &quot;Space Jam&quot;, with legendary basketball player Michael Jordan.

In 2001, a younger version of Tweety appeared on &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, thus coming full circle from his earliest appearances. Here he was voiced by Sam Vincent.

In 2011, Tweety was featured, with his Looney Tunes co-stars, in Cartoon Network&#x27;s series &quot;The Looney Tunes Show.&quot; He is voiced by Jeff Bergman. He appeared in the episode &quot;Ridiculous Journey&quot;, where he and Sylvester work together with Taz to get back home to Granny and Bugs Bunny. He had been revealed to have fought in World War II alongside a young Granny. Sylvester also asked him how old he was, to which Tweety replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll never tell&quot;. Sylvester then asked if Tweety would at least tell him if he (Tweety) was a boy or a girl. Tweety whispered into his ear and Sylvester had a surprised expression and said &quot;Huh, I was wrong&quot;.

Tweety has recently appeared as a major character in &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;, where his designs are mostly based on his Freleng heyday with a few Bob Clampett elements to make him more suited for 1942–1944, and his personality reverts him to being more violent and abusive in nature while being toned down to retain his cute facade. He was voiced again by Bob Bergen. &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; is the second time that Eric Bauza voices Tweety.

On February 17, 2021, it was announced Tweety would star in &quot;Tweety Mysteries&quot; which would have been similar to &quot;The Sylvester &amp; Tweety Mysteries.&quot; The series would have been a live-action/animated hybrid aimed towards girls and would have aired on Cartoon Network. However, the series never got off the ground as Cartoon Network announced all live-action productions were scrapped in December 2022.

Tweety starred in a direct-to-video film &quot;King Tweety&quot; which was released on June 14, 2022. Eric Bauza reprised the role.

Tweety appears in the preschool series &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; which aired as part of Cartoonito on Cartoon Network and HBO Max on July 25, 2022. In the series, similar to &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; and the finale of &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot;, he is friends with Sylvester. Eric Bauza reprised his role from &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot;.

== Merchandise ==
Tweety and Sylvester have been used to endorse products such as Miracle Whip dressing and MCI Communications long distance. In 1998, the United States Post Office honored Tweety and Sylvester with a 32-cent postage stamp. Tweety also appears in products produced by Warner Brothers Studios.

== Modern art ==

British artist Banksy&#x27;s 2008 New York art installation &quot;The Village Pet Store and Charcoal Grill&quot; features &quot;Tweety&quot;, an animatronic sculpture of an aged and molting version of the character. In honor of Tweety&#x27;s 80th anniversary, Warner Bros. Discovery unveiled 80 themed murals done by artists from around the world.

== Comic books ==
Western Publications produced a comic book about Tweety and Sylvester entitled &quot;Tweety and Sylvester&quot;, first in Dell Comics &quot;Four Color&quot; series #406, 489, and 524, then in their own title from Dell Comics (#4–37, 1954–1962), then later from Gold Key Comics (#1–102, 1963–1972).

In 2017, Tweety appeared in the DC Comics special, Catwoman/ Tweety and Sylvester, where Tweety teams up with Black Canary, who he just calls &quot;bwonde wady&quot;.

== Voice actors ==
Voice artist Mel Blanc originated the character&#x27;s voice. After the Golden Age of American Animation came to an end, Blanc continued to voice the character in TV specials, commercials, music recordings, and films, such as 1988&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, which was one of Blanc&#x27;s final projects as Tweety. Before and after Blanc&#x27;s death in 1989, several voice actors have provided the voice in his stead. These voice actors are:

* Danny Kaye (1951 &quot;I Taut I Taw a Puddy Tat&quot; cover)

<doc id="88817" wikidata="Q57285" url="?curid=88817" title="Wilhelm Furtwängler">
<text>Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler ( , , ; 25 January 188630 November 1954) was a German conductor and composer. He is regarded as one of the greatest symphonic and operatic conductors of the 20th century. He was a major influence for many later conductors, and his name is often mentioned when discussing their interpretative styles.

Furtwängler was principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic between 1922 and 1945, and from 1952 until 1954. He was also principal conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra (1922–26), and was a guest conductor of other major orchestras including the Vienna Philharmonic.

Although not an adherent of Nazism, he was the foremost conductor to remain in Germany during the Nazi era. Despite his open opposition to antisemitism and the ubiquity of Nazi symbolism, the regime did not seek to suppress him, at Joseph Goebbels&#x27; insistence, for propaganda reasons. This situation caused lasting controversy, and the extent to which his presence lent prestige to Nazi Germany is still debated.

==Life and career==
Wilhelm Furtwängler was born in Schöneberg (now a district/borough of Berlin) into a prominent family. His father Adolf was an archaeologist, his mother a painter. Most of his childhood was spent in Munich, where his father taught at the city&#x27;s Ludwig Maximilian University. He was given a musical education from an early age, and developed an early love of Ludwig van Beethoven, a composer with whose works he remained closely associated throughout his life.

Although Furtwängler achieved fame chiefly from his conducting, he regarded himself foremost as a composer. He began conducting in order to perform his own works. By age of twenty, he had composed several works. However, they were not well received, and that, combined with the financial insecurity of a career as a composer, led him to concentrate on conducting. He made his conducting debut with the Kaim Orchestra (now the Munich Philharmonic) in Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. He subsequently held conducting posts at Munich, Strasbourg, Lübeck, Mannheim, Frankfurt, and Vienna.

Furtwangler succeeded Artur Bodanzky as principal conductor of the Mannheim Opera and Music Academy in 1915, remaining until 1920. As a boy he had sometimes stayed with his grandmother in Mannheim. Through her family he met the Geissmars, a Jewish family who were leading lawyers and amateur musicians in the town. Berta Geissmar wrote, &quot;Furtwängler became so good at [skiing] as to attain almost professional skill...Almost every sport appealed to him: he loved tennis, sailing and swimming...He was a good horseman...&quot; She also reports that he was a strong mountain climber and hiker.

Berta Geissmar subsequently became his secretary and business manager, in Mannheim and later in Berlin, until she was forced to leave Germany in 1935. From 1921 onwards, Furtwängler shared holidays in the Engadin with Berta and her mother. In 1924 he bought a house there. After he married, the house was open to a wide circle of friends.

In 1920 he was appointed conductor of the Staatskapelle Berlin succeeding Richard Strauss. In January 1922, following the sudden death of Arthur Nikisch, he was appointed to the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Shortly afterwards he was appointed to the prestigious Berlin Philharmonic, again in succession to Nikisch. Furtwängler made his London debut in 1924, and continued to appear there before the outbreak of World War II as late as 1938, when he conducted Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot;. (Furtwängler later conducted in London many times between 1948 and 1954). In 1925 he appeared as guest conductor of the New York Philharmonic, making return visits in the following two years.

In January 1945 Furtwängler fled to Switzerland. It was during this period that he completed what is considered his most significant composition, the Symphony No. 2 in E minor. It was given its premiere in 1948 by the Berlin Philharmonic under Furtwängler&#x27;s direction and was recorded for Deutsche Grammophon.

Following the war, he resumed performing and recording, and remained a popular conductor in Europe, although his actions in the 1930s and 40s were a subject of ongoing criticism. He died in 1954 in Ebersteinburg, close to Baden-Baden. He is buried in the Heidelberg Bergfriedhof.

=== Relationship with the Nazis ===

Furtwängler was very critical of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s appointment as Chancellor of Germany, and was convinced that Hitler would not stay in power for long. He had said of Hitler in 1932, &quot;This hissing street pedlar will never get anywhere in Germany&quot;.

As Nazi Germany increased the persecution of Jews, Jewish musicians were forced out of work and began to leave Germany. The Nazis were aware that Furtwängler was opposed to the policies and might also decide to go abroad, so the Berlin Philharmonic, which employed many Jews, was exempted from the policies. In 1933, when Bruno Walter was dismissed from his position as principal conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the Nazis asked Furtwängler to replace him for an international tour. Their goal was to show to the world that Germany did not need Jewish musicians. Furtwängler refused, and it was Richard Strauss who replaced Walter.

On 10 April 1933, Furtwängler wrote a public letter to Goebbels to denounce the new rulers&#x27; antisemitism:

As stated by the historian Fred K. Prieberg, this letter proved that if the concepts of nation and patriotism had a deep meaning for him, &quot;it is clear that race meant nothing to him&quot;. In June 1933, for a text which was to be the basis for a discussion with Goebbels, Furtwängler went further, writing, &quot;The Jewish question in musical spheres: a race of brilliant people!&quot; He threatened that if boycotts against Jews were extended to artistic activities, he would resign all his posts immediately, concluding that &quot;at any rate to continue giving concerts would be quite impossible without [the Jews] – to remove them would be an operation which would result in the death of the patient.&quot;

Because of his high profile, Furtwängler&#x27;s public opposition prompted a mixed reaction from the Nazi leadership. Heinrich Himmler wished to send Furtwängler to a concentration camp. Goebbels and Göring ordered their administration to listen to Furtwängler&#x27;s requests and to give him the impression that they would do what he asked. This led him to believe that he had some positive influence to stop the racial policy. He subsequently invited several Jewish and anti-fascist artists (such as Yehudi Menuhin, Artur Schnabel, and Pablo Casals) to perform as soloists in his 1933/34 season, but they refused to come to Nazi Germany. Furtwängler subsequently invited Jewish musicians from his orchestra such as Szymon Goldberg to play as soloists.

The Gestapo built a case against Furtwängler, noting that he was providing assistance to Jews. Furtwängler gave all his fees to German emigrants during his concerts outside Germany. The German literary scholar Hans Mayer was one of these emigrants. Mayer later observed that for performances of Wagner operas in Paris prior to the war, Furtwängler cast only German emigrants (Jews or political opponents to the Nazis) to sing. Georg Gerullis, a director at the Ministry of Culture remarked in a letter to Goebbels, &quot;Can you name me a Jew on whose behalf Furtwängler has not intervened?&quot;

Furtwängler never joined the Nazi Party. He refused to give the Nazi salute, to conduct the Horst-Wessel-Lied, or to sign his letters with &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;, even those he wrote to Hitler. Prieberg has found all the letters from the conductor to the dictator: these are always requests for an audience to defend Jewish musicians or musicians considered to be &quot;degenerate&quot;. The fact that he refused to sign them &#x27;Heil Hitler&#x27; was considered a major affront by the Nazi leadership and explains why many of these requests for a hearing were refused. However, Furtwängler was appointed as the first vice-president of the &quot;Reichsmusikkammer&quot; and &quot;Staatsrat of Prussia&quot;, and accepted these honorary positions to try to bend the racial policy of Nazis in music and to support Jewish musicians. For concerts in London and Paris before the war, Furtwängler refused to conduct the Nazi anthems or to play music in halls adorned with swastikas. During the universal exposition held in Paris in 1937, a picture of the German delegation was taken in front of the Arc de Triomphe. In the picture, Furtwängler is the only German not giving the Nazi salute (he has his hand on his shoulder). This picture was suppressed at the time. The photo was, however, carefully preserved by the Gestapo, providing new proof that Furtwängler was opposed to Nazi policy.

In 1933, Furtwängler met with Hitler to try to stop his new antisemitic policy in the domain of music. He had prepared a list of significant Jewish musicians: these included the composer Arnold Schoenberg, the musicologist Curt Sachs, the violinist Carl Flesch, and Jewish members of the Berlin Philharmonic. Hitler did not listen to Furtwängler, who lost patience, and the meeting became a shouting match. Berta Geissmar wrote, &quot;After the audience, he told me that he knew now what was behind Hitler&#x27;s narrow-minded measures. This is not only antisemitism, but the rejection of any form of artistic, philosophical thought, the rejection of any form of free culture...&quot;

=== 1933 Mannheim concert ===

On 26 April 1933, Furtwängler and the Berlin Philharmonic performed a joint concert in Mannheim with the local orchestra to mark the 50th anniversary of Wagner&#x27;s death and to raise money for the Mannheim orchestra. The concert had been organised before the Nazis came to power. The Nazified Mannheim Orchestra Committee demanded that the Jewish leader of the Berlin orchestra, Szymon Goldberg, give way to the leader of the Mannheim orchestra for the evening. Furtwängler refused, and the concert took place as planned.

Before the banquet organized for the evening, members of the Mannheim Orchestra Committee came to remonstrate with Furtwängler, accusing him of &quot;a lack of national sentiment&quot;. Furtwängler furiously left before the banquet to rejoin Berta Geissmar and her mother. The fact that Furtwängler had preferred to spend the evening with his &quot;Jewish friends&quot; rather than with Nazi authorities caused a controversy. He subsequently refused to conduct again in Mannheim, only returning 21 years later in 1954.

=== &quot;The Hindemith Case&quot; ===
In 1934, Furtwängler publicly described Hitler as an &quot;enemy of the human race&quot; and the political situation in Germany as a (&quot;disgrace&quot;, literally: &quot;swinishness&quot;).

On 25 November 1934, he wrote a letter in the &quot;Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Der Fall Hindemith&quot; (&quot;The Hindemith Case&quot;), in support of the composer Paul Hindemith. Hindemith had been labelled a degenerate artist by the Nazis. Furtwängler also conducted a piece by Hindemith, &quot;Mathis der Maler&quot;, although the work had been banned by the Nazis. The concert received enormous acclaim and unleashed a political storm. The Nazis (especially Alfred Rosenberg, the Nazi Party&#x27;s chief racial theorist) formed a violent conspiracy against the conductor, who resigned from his official positions, including as the vice-president of the &quot;Reichsmusikkammer&quot; and as a member of the Prussian State Council. His resignation from the latter position was refused by Göring. He was also forced by Goebbels to give up all his artistic positions.

Furtwängler decided to leave Germany, but the Nazis prevented him. They seized the opportunity to Aryanise the orchestra and its administrative staff. Most of the Jewish musicians of the orchestra had already left the country and found positions outside Germany, with Furtwängler&#x27;s assistance.

The main target of the Nazis was Berta Geissmar. She wrote in her book about Furtwängler that she was so close to the conductor that the Nazis had begun an investigation to know if she was his mistress. After being harassed for a period of two years, she moved to London when she became Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s main assistant. In the book she wrote on Furtwängler in England in 1943, she said:

Furtwängler, although he had decided to remain in Germany, was certainly no Nazi ... He had a private telephone line to me which was not connected via the exchange ... Before going to bed, he used to chat with me over telephone. Sometimes I told him amusing stories to cheer him up, sometimes we talked about politics. One of the main threats the Nazis used against Furtwängler and myself later on was the assertion that they had recorded all these conversations. I should not have thought that it was possible! Was there enough shellac? If the Nazis really did this, their ears must certainly have burnt, and it was not surprising that Furtwängler was eventually put on their black list, let alone myself.

Goebbels refused to meet Furtwängler to clarify his situation for several months. During the same period, many members of the orchestra and of his public were begging him not to emigrate and desert them. In addition, Goebbels sent him a clear signal that if he left Germany he would never be allowed back, frightening him with the prospect of permanent separation from his mother (to whom he was very close) and his children. Furtwängler considered himself responsible for the Berlin Philharmonic and for his family, and decided to stay.

=== Compromise of 1935 ===

On 28 February 1935, Furtwängler met Goebbels, who wanted to keep Furtwängler in Germany, since he considered him, like Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner, a &quot;national treasure&quot;. Goebbels asked him to pledge allegiance publicly to the new regime. Furtwängler refused. Goebbels then proposed that Furtwängler acknowledge publicly that Hitler was in charge of cultural policy. Furtwängler accepted: Hitler was a dictator and controlled everything in the country. But he added that it must be clear that he wanted nothing to do with the policy and that he would remain as a non-political artist, without any official position. The agreement was reached. Goebbels made an announcement declaring that Furtwängler&#x27;s article on Hindemith was not political: Furtwängler had spoken only from an artistic point of view, and it was Hitler who was in charge of the cultural policy in Germany.

Goebbels did not reveal the second part of the deal. However, the agreement between them was largely respected. At his subsequent denazification trial, Furtwängler was charged with conducting only two official concerts for the period 1933–1945. Furtwängler appeared in only two short propaganda films.

Other Nazi leaders were not satisfied with the compromise, since they believed that Furtwängler had not capitulated: Rosenberg demanded in vain that Furtwängler apologise to the regime. Goebbels, who wanted to keep Furtwängler in Germany, wrote in his diary that he was satisfied with the deal and remarked on &quot;the incredible naïvety of artists&quot;.

Hitler now allowed him to have a new passport. When they met again in April, Hitler attacked Furtwängler for his support of modern music, and made him withdraw from regular conducting for the time being, save for his scheduled appearance at Bayreuth. However, Hitler confirmed that Furtwängler would not be given any official titles, and would be treated as a private individual. But Hitler refused Furtwängler&#x27;s request to announce this, saying that it would be harmful for the &quot;prestige of the State&quot;.

Furtwängler resumed conducting. On 25 April 1935, he returned to the Berlin Philharmonic with a program dedicated to Beethoven. Many people who had boycotted the orchestra during his absence came to the concert to support him. He was called out seventeen times. On 3 May, in his dressing room before conducting the same program, he was informed that Hitler and his entire staff would attend the concert. He was given the order to welcome Hitler with the Nazi salute. Furtwängler was so furious that he ripped the wooden panelling off a radiator. Franz Jastrau, the manager of the orchestra, suggested that he keep his baton in his right hand all the time. When he entered the hall, all the Nazi leaders were present making the Hitler salute, but Furtwängler kept hold of his baton and began the concert immediately. Hitler probably could not have imagined that such an affront was possible but decided to put up a good show: he sat down and the concert went on.

At the end of the concert, Furtwängler continued to keep his baton in his right hand. Hitler understood the situation and jumped up and demonstratively held out his right hand to him. The same situation occurred during another concert later on, when a photographer had been mobilized by the Nazis for the occasion: the photo of the famous handshake between Furtwängler and Hitler was distributed everywhere by Goebbels. Goebbels had obtained what he desired: to keep Furtwängler in Germany and to give the impression to those who were not well informed (especially outside the country) that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the regime.

Furtwängler wrote in his diary in 1935 that there was a complete contradiction between the racial ideology of the Nazis and the true German culture, the one of Schiller, Goethe and Beethoven. He added in 1936: &quot;living today is more than ever a question of courage&quot;.

=== New York Philharmonic ===

In September 1935, the baritone Oskar Jölli, a member of the Nazi party, reported to the Gestapo that Furtwängler had said, &quot;Those in power should all be shot, and things in Germany would not change until this was done&quot;. Hitler forbade him to conduct for several months, until Furtwängler&#x27;s fiftieth birthday in January 1936. Hitler and Goebbels allowed him to conduct again and offered him presents: Hitler an annual pension of 40,000 Reichsmarks, and Goebbels an ornate baton made of gold and ivory. Furtwängler refused them.

Furtwängler was offered the principal conductor&#x27;s post at the New York Philharmonic, which was then the most desirable and best paid position in international musical life. He was to have followed Arturo Toscanini, who had declared that Furtwängler was the only man to succeed him. Furtwängler accepted the post, but his telephone conversations were recorded by the Gestapo.

While Furtwängler was travelling, the Berlin branch of the Associated Press leaked a news story on Hermann Göring&#x27;s orders. It suggested Furtwängler would probably be reappointed as director of the Berlin State Opera and of the Berlin Philharmonic. This caused the mood in New York to turn against him: it seemed that Furtwängler was now a supporter of the Nazi Party. On reading the American press reaction, Furtwängler chose not to accept the position in New York. Nor did he accept any position at the Berlin Opera.

=== 1936 to 1937 ===

Furtwängler included Jewish and other non-Aryan musicians during his overseas tours in the 1930s. This was the case in France in April 1934 where he conducted operas by Wagner. Hans Mayer, a professor of literature, a communist Jew exiled from Germany, reported after the war that Furtwängler had voluntarily chosen a cast made up almost entirely of Jews or of people driven out of Germany during these concerts. Likewise, during the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1937, Furtwängler performed a series of Wagnerian concerts which were a triumph. Goebbels announced in the German press that Furtwängler and Wagner had been acclaimed in Paris. In fact, those who made Furtwängler a triumph were precisely German exiles, including many Jews, who lived in Paris and who saw Furtwängler as a symbol of anti-Nazi Germany. Furtwängler also refused to conduct the Nazi anthem and demanded that all swastikas be removed from his concert halls. The Nazis realized and complained that Furtwängler did not bring back any money from his tours abroad. They initially believed that Furtwängler was spending everything for him, and later realized that he was giving all the money to the German emigrants. It confirmed after the war that the conductor gave them everything he had &quot;to the last penny&quot; when he met them. Furtwängler always refused to practice the Nazi salute and conduct the Nazi hymns. When the Berlin orchestra performed abroad, he had to start the concert with the Nazi anthem Horst-Wessel-Lied. As the English and French could see during the period 1935–1939, Furtwängler was replaced by the steward Hans von Benda and only entered the room afterwards.

Furtwängler conducted at the Bayreuth Festival in 1936 for the first time since 1931, in spite of his poor relationship with Winifred Wagner. Here, he conducted a new staging of &quot;Lohengrin&quot; (the first time this work was performed at the festival since 1909) for which Hitler ensured no expense was spared; the costume and set design were on a larger and more expensive scale than anything previously seen at Bayreuth. This performance was broadcast throughout Europe and in the Americas, and was used as part of a propaganda effort intended to portray the &quot;New Germany&quot; as the triumphant inheritor of the German musical tradition rather than a break from the past, to which Furtwängler&#x27;s place at the podium was instrumental. Both Hitler and Goebbels attended the festival and attempted to force him to accept an official position. Friedelind Wagner, the composer&#x27;s anti-Nazi granddaughter, witnessed a meeting between Hitler and Furtwängler at her mother&#x27;s Bayreuth home:

I remember Hitler turning to Furtwängler and telling him that he would now have to allow himself to be used by the party for propaganda purposes, and I remember that Furtwängler refused categorically. Hitler flew into a fury and told Furtwängler that in that case there would be a concentration camp ready for him. Furtwängler quietly replied: &quot;In that case, Herr Reichskanzler, at least I will be in very good company.&quot; Hitler couldn&#x27;t even answer, and vanished from the room.

Furtwängler avoided the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and canceled all his public engagements during the following winter season in order to compose. He returned to the Berlin Philharmonic in 1937, performing with them in London for the coronation of George VI, and in Paris for the universal exposition, where he again refused to conduct the Horst-Wessel-Lied or to attend the political speeches of German officials.

The Salzburg Festival was considered to be a festival of the &quot;free world&quot; and a centre for anti-fascist artists. Hitler had forbidden all German musicians from performing there. In 1937, Furtwängler was asked to conduct Beethoven&#x27;s ninth symphony in Salzburg. Despite strong opposition from Hitler and Goebbels, he accepted the invitation.

Arturo Toscanini, a prominent anti-fascist, was furious to learn that Furtwängler would be at the Festival. He accepted his engagement in Salzburg on the condition that he would not have to meet Furtwängler. But the two did meet, and argued over Furtwängler&#x27;s actions. Toscanini argued: &quot;I know quite well that you are not a member of the Party. I am also aware that you have helped your Jewish friends ... But everyone who conducts in the Third Reich is a Nazi!&quot;. Furtwängler emphatically denied this and said: &quot;By that, you imply that art and music are merely propaganda, a false front, as it were, for any Government which happens to be in power. If a Nazi Government is in power, then, as a conductor, I am a Nazi; under the communists, I would be a Communist; under the democrats, a democrat... No, a thousand times no! Music belongs to a different world, and is above chance political events.&quot; Toscanini disagreed and that ended the discussion.

Furtwängler returned to the Bayreuth Festival, his relationship with Winifred Wagner worse than ever. He did not appear again in Bayreuth until 1943. He wrote a letter to Winifred Wagner, sending copies to Hitler, Göring and Goebbels, accusing her of having betrayed Wagner&#x27;s heritage by applying racial and not artistic rules in the choice of the artists, and of putting her &quot;trust in the powers of an authoritarian state&quot;. This clear attack on Hitler caused a sharp reaction: Hitler wanted to drop Furtwängler from Bayreuth after all. Goebbels wrote in two entries of his diary in 1937 that Furtwängler was constantly helping Jews, &quot;half-Jews&quot; and &quot;his small Hindemith&quot;.

According to the historian Fred Prieberg, by the end of 1937 nobody who was correctly informed could accuse Furtwängler of working for the Nazis.

=== Herbert von Karajan ===

The Nazi leaders searched for another conductor to counterbalance Furtwängler. A young, gifted Austrian conductor now appeared in Nazi Germany: Herbert von Karajan. Karajan had been a member of the Nazi Party since 1935, and was much more willing to participate in the propaganda of the new regime than Furtwängler.

Furtwängler had attended several of his concerts, praising his technical gifts but criticizing his conducting style; he did not consider him a serious competitor. However, when Karajan conducted &quot;Fidelio&quot; and &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; in Berlin in late 1938, Göring decided to take the initiative. The music critic Edwin von der Nüll wrote a review of these concerts with the support of Göring. Its title, &quot;The Karajan Miracle&quot;, was a reference to the famous article &quot;The Furtwängler Miracle&quot; that had made Furtwängler famous as a young conductor in Mannheim. Von der Nüll championed Karajan saying, &quot;A thirty-year-old man creates a performance for which our great fifty-year-olds can justifiably envy him&quot;. Furtwängler&#x27;s photo was printed next to the article, making the reference clear.

The article was part of a broader attack made against Furtwängler. The Nazi press criticized him for being &quot;a man of the nineteenth century&quot; whose political ideas were obsolete and who did not understand and accept the new changes in Germany. The situation became intolerable for Furtwängler. He obtained from Goebbels a pledge to cease these attacks.

However, Furtwängler&#x27;s position was weakened: he knew that if he left Germany, Karajan would immediately become the conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. It was the beginning of an obsessive hate and contempt for Karajan that stayed with him until his death. He often refused to call Karajan by his name, calling him simply &quot;Herr K&quot;. Hitler&#x27;s opinion was that even if Furtwängler was better than Karajan as a conductor, it was necessary to keep Karajan &quot;in reserve&quot; since Furtwängler was &quot;not politically trustworthy&quot;.

=== &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; and the &quot;Anschluss&quot; ===

Furtwängler was very affected by the events of &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;. Berta Geissmar, who met him in Paris, described him as &quot;greatly depressed&quot;. Friedelind Wagner, who saw him also in Paris, wrote that he was a &quot;very unhappy man&quot;. Andrew Schulhof, who met him in Budapest said that &quot;he had the impression that what he had done before for his Jewish friends had been lost&quot;.

Furtwängler approved of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; that had occurred on 12 March 1938. But he quickly disagreed with the Nazi leaders&#x27; decision to &quot;annex Austrian culture&quot; by abolishing independent cultural activity in Austria and subordinating it to Berlin. Just after the Anschluss, Furtwängler discovered that a huge Swastika flag was displayed in the hall of the Musikverein. He refused to conduct the Vienna Philharmonic &quot;as long as the rag is visible&quot;. The flag was finally removed.

Goebbels wanted to eliminate the Vienna Philharmonic and to convert the Vienna Opera and the Salzburg Festival into branches of the Berlin Opera and the Bayreuth Festival respectively. In addition, he wished to confiscate the largest musical collection in the world, belonging to the &quot;Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde&quot; in Vienna and to move it to Berlin. Hitler&#x27;s goal was to deny that Austria had developed its own culture independently of Germany. Austrian musical circles asked Furtwängler, who was the honorary president of the Vienna &quot;Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde&quot;, to help them.

Furtwängler campaigned to convince Nazi leaders to abandon their plans. According to historian Fred K. Prieberg, he conducted concerts (often with the Vienna Philharmonic) in the presence of German leaders during this period in exchange for the conservation of the orchestra. He organized several concerts of Austrian music in Berlin and Vienna for Hitler, to highlight Austrian culture. The Nazi leadership, who wanted to take advantage of this situation, invited Furtwängler in 1938 to conduct &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; with the Vienna Philharmonic in Nürnberg for the Nazi party congress. Furtwängler accepted to conduct, as long as the performance was not during the party congress. Hitler eventually accepted Furtwängler&#x27;s conditions: the concert took place on 5 September and the political event was formally opened the following morning. This concert, along with one given in Berlin in 1942 for Hitler&#x27;s birthday, led to heavy criticism of Furtwängler after the war. However, Furtwängler had managed not to participate in the party congress. He had also succeeded in conserving the Vienna Philharmonic, and the musical collections of Vienna and the Vienna Opera, where he persuaded Hitler and Goebbels to agree to the appointment of Karl Böhm as artistic director. At the Vienna Philharmonic, as at the Berlin Philharmonic, Furtwängler succeeded in protecting &#x27;half-Jews&#x27; or members with &#x27;non-aryan&#x27; wives until the end of the war (these were exceptional cases in Germany during the Nazi period). However, in contrast to his experience with the Berlin Philharmonic, he could not save the lives of &#x27;full-blooded&#x27; Jews: they were persecuted, with a number dying in concentration camps.

Goebbels was satisfied that Furtwängler had conducted the concerts in Vienna, Prague and Nürnberg, thinking that these concerts gave a &quot;cultural&quot; justification to the annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia. During this period he said that Furtwängler was &quot;willing to place himself at my disposal for any of my activities&quot;, describing him as &quot;an out-and-out chauvinist&quot;. However, he regularly complained that Furtwängler was helping Jews and &#x27;half-Jews&#x27;, and his complaints continued during the war. Goebbels wrote in his diary that Furtwängler&#x27;s goal was to bypass Nazi cultural policy. For instance, Goebbels wrote that Furtwängler supported the Salzburg festival to counterbalance the Bayreuth Festival, a keystone of the Nazi regime.

Furtwängler was very affected by the events of the 1930s. Fred K. Prieberg describes Furtwängler in 1939 as a &quot;broken man&quot;. The French government awarded him the Legion of Honour in 1939, which may support the theory that western diplomatic services knew Furtwängler was not a supporter of the Nazi regime. Hitler forbade news of the award to be spread in Germany.

=== World War II ===

During the war, Furtwängler tried to avoid conducting in occupied Europe. He said: &quot;I will never play in a country such as France, which I am so much attached to, considering myself a &#x27;vanquisher&#x27;. I will conduct there again only when the country has been liberated&quot;. He refused to go to France during its occupation, although the Nazis tried to force him to conduct there. Since he had said that he would conduct there only at the invitation of the French, Goebbels forced the French conductor Charles Munch to send him a personal invitation. But Munch wrote in small characters at the bottom of his letter &quot;in agreement with the German occupation authorities.&quot; Furtwängler declined the invitation.

Furtwängler did conduct in Prague in November 1940 and March 1944. The 1940 program, chosen by Furtwängler, included Smetana&#x27;s &quot;Moldau&quot;. According to Prieberg, &quot;This piece is part of the cycle in which the Czech master celebrated Má vlast (My Country), and ... was intended to support his compatriots&#x27; fight for the independence from Austrian domination ... When Furtwängler began with the &#x27;Moldau&#x27; it was not a deliberate risk, but a statement of his stance towards the oppressed Czechs&quot;. The 1944 concert marked the fifth anniversary of the German occupation and was the result of a deal between Furtwängler and Goebbels: Furtwängler did not want to perform in April for Hitler&#x27;s birthday in Berlin. He said to Goebbels in March (as he had in April 1943) that he was sick. Goebbels asked him to perform in Prague instead, where he conducted the Symphony No. 9 of Antonín Dvořák. He conducted in Oslo in 1943, where he helped the Jewish conductor Issay Dobrowen to flee to Sweden.

In April 1942, Furtwängler conducted a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s ninth symphony with the Berlin Philharmonic for Hitler&#x27;s birthday. At least the final minutes of the performance were filmed and can be seen on YouTube. At the end, Goebbels came to the front of the stage to shake Furtwängler&#x27;s hand. This concert led to heavy criticism of Furtwängler after the war. In fact, Furtwängler had planned several concerts in Vienna during this period to avoid this celebration. But after the defeat of the German army during the Battle of Moscow, Goebbels had decided to make a long speech on the eve of Hitler&#x27;s birthday to galvanize the German nation. The speech would be followed by Beethoven&#x27;s ninth symphony. Goebbels wanted Furtwängler to conduct the symphony by whatever means to give a transcendent dimension to the event. He called Furtwängler shortly before to ask him to agree to conduct the symphony but the latter refused arguing that he had no time to rehearse and that he had to perform several concerts in Vienna. But Goebbels forced the organizers in Vienna (by threatening them: some were physically assaulted by the Nazis) to cancel the concerts and ordered Furtwängler to return to Berlin In 1943 and 1944, Furtwängler provided false medical certificates in advance to be sure that such a situation would not happen again.

It is now known that Furtwängler continued to use his influence to help Jewish musicians and non-musicians escape Nazi Germany. He managed to have Max Zweig, a nephew of conductor Fritz Zweig, released from Dachau concentration camp. Others, from an extensive list of Jews he helped, included Carl Flesch, Josef Krips and the composer Arnold Schoenberg.

Furtwängler refused to participate in the propaganda film &quot;Philharmoniker&quot;. Goebbels wanted Furtwängler to feature in it, but Furtwängler declined to take part. The film was finished in December 1943 showing many conductors connected with the Berlin Philharmonic, including Eugen Jochum, Karl Böhm, Hans Knappertsbusch, and Richard Strauss, but not Furtwängler. Goebbels also asked Furtwängler to direct the music in a film about Beethoven, again for propaganda purposes. They quarrelled violently about this project. Furtwängler told him &quot;You are wrong, &quot;Herr Minister&quot;, if you think you can exploit Beethoven in a film.&quot; Goebbels gave up his plans for the film.

In April 1944, Goebbels wrote:

Furtwängler has never been a National Socialist. Nor has he ever made any bones about it, which Jews and emigrants thought was sufficient to consider him as one of them, a key representative of so-called &#x27;inner emigration&#x27;. Furtwängler[&#x27;s] stance towards us has not changed in the least.

Friedelind Wagner (an outspoken opponent of the Nazis) reported a conversation with her mother Winifred Wagner (an outspoken supporter and a friend of Hitler) during the war, to the effect that Hitler did not trust or like Furtwängler, and that Göring and Goebbels were upset with Furtwängler&#x27;s continuous support for his &quot;undesirable friends&quot;. Yet Hitler, in gratitude for Furtwängler&#x27;s refusal to leave Berlin even when it was being bombed, ordered Albert Speer to build a special air raid shelter for the conductor and his family. Furtwängler refused it, but the shelter was nevertheless built in the house against his will. Speer related that in December 1944 Furtwängler asked whether Germany had any chance of winning the war. Speer replied in the negative, and advised him to flee to Switzerland from possible Nazi retribution. In 1944, he was the only prominent German artist who refused to sign the brochure &#x27;We Stand and Fall with Adolf Hitler&#x27;.

Furtwängler&#x27;s name was included on the Gottbegnadeten list (&quot;God-gifted List&quot;) of September 1944 as one of only three musicians in the special category designated as &quot;unersetzliche Künstler&quot; (&quot;indispensable artists&quot;; the others were Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner). He was removed on 7 December 1944, however, because of his relationships with German resistance. Furtwängler had strong links to the German resistance which organized the 20 July plot. He stated during his denazification trial that he knew an attack was being organized against Hitler, although he did not participate in its organization. He knew Claus von Stauffenberg very well and his doctor, Johannes Ludwig Schmitt, who wrote him many false health prescriptions to bypass official requirements, was a member of the Kreisau Circle. Furtwängler&#x27;s concerts were sometimes chosen by the members of the German resistance as a meeting point. Rudolf Pechel, a member of the resistance group which organized the 20 July plot said to Furtwängler after the war: &quot;In the circle of our resistance movement it was an accepted fact that you were the only one in the whole of our musical world who really resisted, and you were one of us.&quot; Graf Kaunitz, also a member of that circle, stated: &quot;In Furtwängler&#x27;s concerts we were one big family of the resistance.&quot;

Grove Online states that Furtwängler was &quot;within a few hours of being arrested&quot; by the Gestapo when he fled to Switzerland, following a concert in Vienna with the Vienna Philharmonic on 28 January 1945. The Nazis had begun to crack down on German liberals. At the concert he conducted Brahms&#x27;s Second Symphony, which was recorded and is considered one of his greatest performances.

=== After World War II ===

In February 1946, Furtwängler met a German Jew in Vienna named Curt Riess who had fled Germany in 1933. Riess was a musician and writer; he later wrote a book on Furtwängler. Riess was then a journalist and correspondent in Switzerland for American newspapers. He thought Furtwängler was a Nazi collaborator and objected to having Furtwängler directing in Switzerland in 1945. Furtwängler asked to meet him and when Riess had studied all the documents concerning Furtwängler, he completely changed his mind. Realizing that Furtwängler had never been a Nazi and had helped many people of Jewish origin, he became his &quot;denazification advisor&quot;. A long friendship ensued and Riess spent the next two years doing everything to get Furtwängler exonerated. As Roger Smithson writes at the conclusion of his article &quot;Furtwängler&#x27;s Silent Years (1945–1947)&quot;: &quot;Ultimately Furtwängler&#x27;s return to conducting was very largely the result of skill and stubbornness of Curt Riess. Furtwängler&#x27;s admirers owe him a great debt&quot;.

Furtwängler initially wanted Riess to write articles about him based on the many documents he had provided him because Riess was a journalist. However, Riess preferred to go himself to meet General Robert A. McClure who was in charge of the Furtwängler file. The general, after meeting Riess and having all the documents translated into English, admitted that no serious charge could be brought against Furtwängler and that they had made a mistake concerning the conductor who was &quot;a very good man&quot;. He asked Riess to tell Furtwängler not to speak to the press, so as not to give the impression that he was exerting pressure on the Allied forces. He said the case would be closed within weeks. Riess sent a telegram to Furtwängler to this effect, but the telegram took a long time to reach its destination and arrived too late.

In the meantime, Furtwängler had made a very serious mistake: he had gone to Berlin, which was occupied by the Soviets. The latter received him as a Head of State because they wanted to recover the one that Arsenyi Gouliga, the representative of the Soviet Union at the Furtwängler trial, called the &quot;greatest conductor in the world&quot; to lead a great cultural policy in Berlin. Precisely, the Soviets offered the post of director of the Berlin State Opera, which was in the Soviet zone, to Furtwängler. General Robert A. McClure was forced to pass Furtwängler by the normal denazification procedure. He explained to Curt Riess, by telephone, that otherwise it gave the impression that the Americans had ceded to the Soviets on the Furtwängler file. The American authorities knew that the conductor would necessarily be cleared by the denazification court and the Soviet authorities declared that this trial made no sense and was &quot;ridiculous&quot;. Thus, with the backdrop of the Cold War, Furtwängler, who absolutely wanted to recover the Berlin Philharmonic which was in the British occupation zone, was obliged to go through the denazification court.

Furtwängler was thus required to submit to a process of denazification. The charges were very low. He was charged with having conducted two official Nazi concerts during the period 1933–1945. Furtwängler declared that for two concerts that had been &quot;extorted&quot; from him, he had avoided sixty. The first was for the Hitler Youth on 3 February 1938. It was presented to Furtwängler as a way to acquaint younger generations with classical music. According to Fred Prieberg: &quot;when he looked at the audience he realized that this was more than just a concert for school kids in uniform; a whole collection of prominent political figures were sitting there as well ... and it was the last time he raised his baton for this purpose&quot;.

The second concert was the performance of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; with the Vienna Philharmonic on 5 September 1938, on the evening before the Nazi congress in Nüremberg. Furtwängler had agreed to conduct this concert to help preserve the Vienna Philharmonic, and at his insistence the concert was not part of the congress.

He was charged for his honorary title of &quot;Prussian State Counselor&quot; () (he had resigned from this title in 1934, but the Nazis had refused his resignation) and with making an anti-Semitic remark against the part-Jewish conductor Victor de Sabata (see below). The chair of the commission, Alex Vogel, known for being a communist, started the trial with the following statement:

The investigations showed that Furtwängler had not been a member of any [Nazi] organization, that he tried to help people persecuted because of their race, and that he also avoided... formalities such as giving the Hitler salute.

The prosecution believed it had something more substantial because Hans von Benda, a former member of the Nazi Party who had been the artistic director of the Berlin Philharmonic during the Nazi period and had therefore been in constant contact with Furtwängler for many years, absolutely wanted to testify to accuse Furtwängler of anti-Semitism. He said he heard, during an argument with another German musician, that Furtwängler allegedly said: &quot;a Jew like Sabata cannot play Brahms&#x27; music&quot; . This story soon became ridiculous: Furtwängler had played Brahms&#x27; music with many Jewish musicians (especially those from his orchestra). This was either a mistake or a misunderstanding: Furtwängler probably had no anti-Semitic feelings towards Sabata who had been his friend. On the other hand, Hans von Benda was forced to admit that he was not directly present when Furtwängler allegedly spoke these words, and his testimony was therefore not taken seriously by the prosecution.
The reason for Hans von Benda&#x27;s behavior was as follows: he had been dismissed from his post as artistic director of the Berlin Orchestra on 22 December 1939 for numerous serious professional misconduct. He had wished to take the opportunity of the lawsuit for take revenge on Furtwängler, considering him responsible for his dismissal because he would have supported Karajan, a version very strongly contested by Furtwängler and his wife. Moreover, historian Fred Prieberg has proved that, on the contrary, Hans von Benda had never ceased to send information to the Nazis (to denounce it) proving that Furtwängler was helping Jews and opposing their policies.

Two of the main people who prepared Furtwängler&#x27;s defense for his denazification trial were two German Jews who had to flee the Nazi regime: his secretary Berta Geissmar and Curt Riess. The two had very different backgrounds. Berta Geissmar knew Furtwängler personally and had witnessed everything he did at the start of the Nazi period; she left Germany in 1936 but returned from exile. Curt Riess did not know Furtwängler at all and initially had a very negative outlook on the conductor. Geissmar had collected hundreds of files to prepare the conductor&#x27;s defense, files which contained a list of over 80 Jewish and non-Jewish people who had claimed to have been helped or saved by him. This list was not exhaustive, but it concerned cases where Geissmar had managed to find indisputable concrete evidence. Among the many people involved were Communists, Social Democrats, as well as former Nazis whom the regime had turned against. Berta Geissmar had forwarded the documents to General Robert A. McClure in charge of the Furtwängler trial, but the documents had mysteriously disappeared in Berlin, when they were to be handed over to the general of the American zone of occupation. Curt Riess also did not find these documents in the Washington archives. Furtwängler therefore found himself without a means of proving the help he had given to many people. However, three people of Jewish origin had made the trip to Berlin and certified on 17 December 1946, the second day of the trial, that Furtwängler had risked his life to protect them. One of them was Paul Heizberg, former opera director. The other two were members of the Philharmonic such as Hugo Strelitzer, who declared:

If I am alive today, I owe this to this great man. Furtwängler helped and protected a great number of Jewish musicians and this attitude shows a great deal of courage since he did it under the eyes of the Nazis, in Germany itself. History will be his judge.

As part of his closing remarks at his denazification trial, Furtwängler said:

I knew Germany was in a terrible crisis; I felt responsible for German music, and it was my task to survive this crisis, as much as I could. The concern that my art was misused for propaganda had to yield to the greater concern that German music be preserved, that music be given to the German people by its own musicians. These people, the compatriots of Bach and Beethoven, of Mozart and Schubert, still had to go on living under the control of a regime obsessed with total war. No one who did not live here himself in those days can possibly judge what it was like. Does Thomas Mann [who was critical of Furtwängler&#x27;s actions] really believe that in &#x27;the Germany of Himmler&#x27; one should not be permitted to play Beethoven? Could he not realize that people never needed more, never yearned more to hear Beethoven and his message of freedom and human love, than precisely these Germans, who had to live under Himmler&#x27;s terror? I do not regret having stayed with them.

The prosecution itself acknowledging that no charge of anti-Semitism or sympathy for Nazi ideology could be brought against the conductor, Furtwängler was cleared on all the counts. Even after Furtwängler&#x27;s acquittal at the denazification trials, Mann still criticized him for continuing to conduct in Germany and for believing that art could be apolitical in a regime such as Nazi Germany, which was so intent on using art as propaganda. In a drafted letter to the editor of &quot;Aufbau&quot; magazine, Mann praises Furtwängler for assisting Jewish musicians and as a &quot;preeminent musician&quot;, but ultimately presents him as a representative example of a fatal &quot;lack of understanding and lack of desire to understand what had seized power in Germany&quot;.

The violinist Yehudi Menuhin was, with Arnold Schoenberg, Bronisław Huberman, and Nathan Milstein, among the Jewish musicians who had a positive view of Furtwängler. In February 1946, he sent a wire to General Robert A. McClure in February 1946:

Unless you have secret incriminating evidence against Furtwängler supporting your accusation that he was a tool of Nazi Party, I beg to take violent issue with your decision to ban him. The man never was a Party member. Upon numerous occasions, he risked his own safety and reputation to protect friends and colleagues. Do not believe that the fact of remaining in one&#x27;s own country is alone sufficient to condemn a man. On the contrary, as a military man, you would know that remaining at one&#x27;s post often requires greater courage than running away. He saved, and for that we are deeply his debtors, the best part of his own German culture... I believe it patently unjust and most cowardly for us to make of Furtwängler a scapegoat for our own crimes.

In 1949 Furtwängler accepted the position of principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. However the orchestra was forced to rescind the offer under the threat of a boycott from several prominent musicians including Arturo Toscanini, George Szell, Vladimir Horowitz, Arthur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern, and Alexander Brailowsky.

According to a &quot;New York Times&quot; report, Horowitz said that he &quot;was prepared to forgive the small fry who had no alternative but to remain and work in Germany.&quot; But Furtwängler &quot;was out of the country on several occasions and could have elected to keep out&quot;. Rubinstein likewise wrote in a telegram, &quot;Had Furtwängler been firm in his democratic convictions he would have left Germany&quot;. Yehudi Menuhin was upset with this boycott, declaring that some of the main organizers had admitted to him that they had organized it only to eliminate Furtwängler&#x27;s presence in North America.

Wilhelm Furtwängler died on 30 November 1954 of pneumonia, in Baden-Baden. He was buried in Heidelberg cemetery, the Bergfriedhof, in his mother&#x27;s vault. A large number of personalities from the artistic and political world were present, including Chancellor Konrad Adenauer.

After Furtwängler&#x27;s death, the Jewish writer and theater director Ernst Lothar said:

He was totally German and he remained so, despite the attacks. This is why he did not leave his defiled country, which was later counted to him as a stain by those who did not know him well enough. But he did not stay with Hitler and Himmler, but with Beethoven and Brahms.

At the end of his life, Yehudi Menuhin said of Furtwängler, &quot;It was his greatness that attracted hatred&quot;.

== Conducting style ==
Furtwängler had a unique philosophy of music. He saw symphonic music as creations of nature that could only be realised subjectively into sound. Neville Cardus wrote in the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; in 1954 of Furtwängler&#x27;s conducting style: &quot;He did not regard the printed notes of the score as a final statement, but rather as so many symbols of an imaginative conception, ever changing and always to be felt and realised subjectively...&quot;
And the conductor Henry Lewis: &quot;I admire Furtwängler for his originality and honesty. He liberated himself from slavery to the score; he realized that notes printed in the score, are nothing but SYMBOLS. The score is neither the essence nor the spirit of the music. Furtwängler had this very rare and great gift of going beyond the printed score and showing what music really was.&quot;

Many commentators and critics regard him as the greatest conductor in history. In his book on the symphonies of Johannes Brahms, musicologist Walter Frisch writes that Furtwängler&#x27;s recordings show him to be &quot;the finest Brahms conductor of his generation, perhaps of all time&quot;, demonstrating &quot;at once a greater attention to detail and to Brahms&#x27; markings than his contemporaries and at the same time a larger sense of rhythmic-temporal flow that is never deflected by the individual nuances. He has an ability not only to respect, but to make musical sense of, dynamic markings and the indications of crescendo and diminuendo... What comes through amply... is the rare combination of a conductor who understands both sound and structure.&quot; He notes Vladimir Ashkenazy who says that his sound &quot;is never rough. It&#x27;s very weighty but at the same time is never heavy. In his fortissimo you always feel every voice... I have never heard so beautiful a fortissimo in an orchestra&quot;, and Daniel Barenboim says he &quot;had a subtlety of tone color that was extremely rare. His sound was always &#x27;rounded,&#x27; and incomparably more interesting than that of the great German conductors of his generation.&quot;

On the other hand, the critic David Hurwitz sharply criticizes what he terms &quot;the Furtwängler wackos&quot; who &quot;will forgive him virtually any lapse, no matter how severe&quot;, and characterizes the conductor himself as &quot;occasionally incandescent but criminally sloppy&quot;. Unlike conductors such as Carlos Kleiber or Sergiu Celibidache, Furtwängler did not try to reach the perfection in details, and the number of rehearsals with him was small. He said:

I am told that the more you rehearse, the better you play. This is wrong. We often try to reduce the unforeseen to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let&#x27;s allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter is the one who improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream ... As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making is something else than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo&#x27;s sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones because here I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That&#x27;s what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.

His style is often contrasted with that of his contemporary Arturo Toscanini. He walked out of a Toscanini concert once, calling him &quot;a mere time-beater!&quot;. Unlike Toscanini, Furtwängler sought a weighty, less rhythmically strict, more bass-oriented orchestral sound, with a more conspicuous use of tempo changes not indicated in the printed score. Instead of perfection in details, Furtwängler was looking for the spiritual in art. Sergiu Celibidache explained,

Everybody was influenced at the time by Arturo Toscanini – it was easy to understand what he was trying to do: you didn&#x27;t need any reference to spiritual dimension. There was a certain order in the way the music was presented. With Toscanini I never felt anything spiritual. With Furtwängler on the other hand, I understood that there I was confronted by something completely different: metaphysics, transcendence, the relationship between sounds and sonorities ... Furtwängler was not only a musician, he was a creator ... Furtwängler had the ear for it: not the physical ear, but the spiritual ear that captures these parallel movements.

Furtwängler&#x27;s art of conducting is considered the synthesis and the peak of the so-called &quot;Germanic school of conducting&quot;. This &quot;school&quot; was initiated by Richard Wagner. Unlike Mendelssohn&#x27;s conducting style, which was &quot;characterized by quick, even tempos and imbued with what many people regarded as model logic and precision ..., Wagner&#x27;s way was broad, hyper-romantic and embraced the idea of tempo modulation&quot;. Wagner considered an interpretation as a re-creation and put more emphasis on the phrase than on the measure. The fact that the tempo was changing was not something new; Beethoven himself interpreted his own music with a lot of freedom. Beethoven wrote: &quot;my tempi are valid only for the first bars, as feeling and expression must have their own tempo&quot;, and &quot;why do they annoy me by asking for my tempi? Either they are good musicians and ought to know how to play my music, or they are bad musicians and in that case my indications would be of no avail&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s disciples, such as Anton Schindler, testified that the composer varied the tempo when he conducted his works. Wagner&#x27;s tradition was followed by the first two permanent conductors of the Berlin Philharmonic. Hans von Bülow highlighted more the unitary structure of symphonic works, while Arthur Nikisch stressed the magnificence of tone. The styles of these two conductors were synthesized by Furtwängler.

In Munich (1907–1909), Furtwängler studied with Felix Mottl, a disciple of Wagner. He considered Arthur Nikisch as his model. According to John Ardoin, Wagner&#x27;s &quot;subjective style&quot; of conducting led to Furtwängler, and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;objective style&quot; of conducting led to Toscanini.

Furtwängler&#x27;s art was deeply influenced by the great Jewish music theorist Heinrich Schenker with whom he worked between 1920 and Schenker&#x27;s death in 1935. Schenker was the founder of Schenkerian analysis, which emphasized underlying long-range harmonic tensions and resolutions in a piece of music. Furtwängler read Schenker&#x27;s famous monograph on Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth symphony in 1911, subsequently trying to find and read all his books. Furtwängler met Schenker in 1920, and they continuously worked together on the repertoire which Furtwängler conducted. Schenker never secured an academic position in Austria and Germany, in spite of Furtwängler&#x27;s efforts to support him. Schenker depended on several patrons including Furtwängler. Furtwängler&#x27;s second wife certified much later that Schenker had an immense influence on her husband. Schenker considered Furtwängler as the greatest conductor in the world and as the &quot;only conductor who truly understood Beethoven&quot;.

Furtwängler&#x27;s recordings are characterized by an &quot;extraordinary sound wealth &quot;, special emphasis being placed on cellos, double basses, percussion and woodwind instruments. According to Furtwängler, he learned how to obtain this kind of sound from Arthur Nikisch. This richness of sound is partly due to his &quot;vague&quot; beat, often called a &quot;fluid beat&quot;. This fluid beat created slight gaps between the sounds made by the musicians, allowing listeners to distinguish all the instruments in the orchestra, even in tutti sections. Vladimir Ashkenazy once said: &quot;I never heard such beautiful fortissimi as Furtwängler&#x27;s.&quot; According to Yehudi Menuhin, Furtwängler&#x27;s fluid beat was more difficult but superior than Toscanini&#x27;s very precise beat. Unlike Otto Klemperer, Furtwängler did not try to suppress emotion in performance, instead giving a hyper romantic aspect to his interpretations. The emotional intensity of his World War II recordings is particularly famous. Conductor and pianist Christoph Eschenbach has said of Furtwängler that he was a &quot;formidable magician, a man capable of setting an entire ensemble of musicians on fire, sending them into a state of ecstasy&quot;. Furtwängler desired to retain an element of improvisation and of the unexpected in his concerts, each interpretation being conceived as a re-creation. However, melodic line as well as the global unity were never lost with Furtwängler, even in the most dramatic interpretations, partly due to the influence of Heinrich Schenker and to the fact that Furtwängler was a composer and had studied composition during his whole life.

Furtwängler was famous for his exceptional inarticulacy when speaking about music. His pupil Sergiu Celibidache remembered that the best he could say was, &quot;Well, just listen&quot; (to the music). from the German BBC service tried to interview him, and thought he had an imbecile before him. A live recording of a rehearsal with a Stockholm orchestra documents hardly anything intelligible, only hums and mumbling. On the other hand, a collection of his essays, &quot;On Music,&quot; reveals deep thought.

== Influence ==
One of Furtwängler&#x27;s protégés was the pianist prodigy Karlrobert Kreiten who was killed by the Nazis in 1943 because he had criticized Hitler. He was an important influence on the pianist/conductor Daniel Barenboim (who decided to become a conductor when he was eight years old during a concert of the Passion Saint Matthew by Bach conducted by Furtwängler in 1950 in Buenos Aires ), of whom Furtwängler&#x27;s widow, Elisabeth Furtwängler, said, &quot;Er furtwänglert&quot; (&quot;He furtwänglers&quot;). Barenboim has conducted a recording of Furtwängler&#x27;s 2nd Symphony, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Other conductors known to speak admiringly of Furtwängler include Valery Gergiev, Claudio Abbado, Carlos Kleiber, Carlo Maria Giulini, Simon Rattle, Sergiu Celibidache, Otto Klemperer, Karl Böhm, Bruno Walter, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Christoph Eschenbach, Alexander Frey, Philippe Herreweghe, Eugen Jochum, Zubin Mehta, Ernest Ansermet, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Bernard Haitink (who decided to become a conductor as a child and bedridden while listening to a Furtwängler concert on the radio
during the second world war), Rafael Kubelík, Gustavo Dudamel, Jascha Horenstein (who had worked as an assistant to Furtwängler in Berlin during the 1920s), Kurt Masur and Christian Thielemann. For instance, Carlos Kleiber thought that &quot;nobody could equal Furtwängler&quot;. George Szell, whose precise musicianship was in many ways antithetical to Furtwängler&#x27;s, always kept a picture of Furtwängler in his dressing room. Even Arturo Toscanini, usually regarded as Furtwängler&#x27;s complete antithesis (and sharply critical of Furtwängler on political grounds), once said – when asked to name the World&#x27;s greatest conductor apart from himself – &quot;Furtwängler!&quot;. Herbert von Karajan, who in his early years was Furtwängler&#x27;s rival, maintained throughout his life that Furtwängler was one of the great influences on his music making, even though his cool, objective, modern style had little in common with Furtwängler&#x27;s white-hot Romanticism. Karajan said:

He certainly had an enormous influence on me ... I remember that when I was Generalmusikdirektor in Aachen, a friend invited me to a concert that Furtwängler gave in Cologne ... Furtwängler&#x27;s performance of the Schumann&#x27;s Fourth, which I didn&#x27;t know at the time, opened up a new world for me. I was deeply impressed. I didn&#x27;t want to forget this concert, so I immediately returned to Aachen.

And Claudio Abbado said in an interview about his career (published in 2004):

Furtwängler is the greatest of all […]; Admittedly, one can sometimes dispute his choices, his options, but enthusiasm almost always prevails, especially in Beethoven. He is the musician who had the greatest influence on my artistic education.

Furtwängler&#x27;s performances of Beethoven, Wagner, Bruckner, and Brahms remain important reference points today, as do his interpretations of other works such as Haydn&#x27;s 88th Symphony, Schubert&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, and Schumann&#x27;s Fourth Symphony. He was also a champion of modern music, notably the works of Paul Hindemith and Arnold Schoenberg and conducted the World premiere of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s Fifth Piano Concerto (with the composer at the piano) on 31 October 1932 as well as performances of Béla Bartók&#x27;s Concerto for Orchestra.

The musicians who have expressed the highest opinion about Furtwängler are some of the most prominent ones of the 20th century such as Arnold Schoenberg, Paul Hindemith, or Arthur Honegger. Soloists such as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Yehudi Menuhin Pablo Casals, Kirsten Flagstad, Claudio Arrau and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf who have played music with almost all the major conductors of the 20th century have clearly declared upon several occasions that, for them, Furtwängler was the most important one. John Ardoin has reported the following discussion he has had with Maria Callas in August 1968 after having listened to Beethoven&#x27;s Eighth Symphony with the Cleveland Orchestra conducted by George Szell:

&quot;Well&quot;, she sighed, &quot;you see what we have been reduced to. We are now in a time when a Szell is considered a master. How small he was next to Furtwängler.&quot; Reeling this disbelief – not at her verdict, with which I agreed, but from the unvarnished acuteness of it – I stammered, &quot;But how do you know Furtwängler? You never sang with him.&quot; &quot;How do you think?&quot; she stared at me with equal disbelief. &quot;He started his career after the war in Italy [in 1947]. I heard dozens of his concerts there. To me, he Beethoven.&quot;

== Notable recordings ==
There are a huge number of Furtwängler recordings currently available, mostly live. Many of these were made during World War II using experimental tape technology. After the war they were confiscated by the Soviet Union for decades, and have only recently become widely available, often on multiple labels. In spite of their limitations, the recordings from this era are widely admired by Furtwängler devotees.

<doc id="88818" wikidata="Q7825168" url="?curid=88818" title="Topspinner">
<text>A topspinner is a type of delivery bowled by a cricketer bowling either wrist spin or finger spin. In either case, the bowler imparts the ball with top spin by twisting it with his or her fingers prior to delivery. In both cases, the topspinner is the halfway house between the stock delivery and the &quot;wrong&#x27;un&quot; - in the wrist spinner&#x27;s case his googly, and in the finger spinner&#x27;s case his doosra.

==Mechanics==

A topspinner is released over the top of the fingers in such a way that it spins forward in the air towards the batsman in flight. The forward spinning motion impedes air travelling over the ball, but assists air travelling underneath. The difference in air pressure above and underneath the ball (described as the Magnus effect) acts as a downward force, meaning that the ball falls earlier and faster than normal.

In cricketing terms, this means that the ball drops shorter, falls faster and bounces higher than might otherwise be anticipated by the batsman. These properties are summed up in cricketing terms as a &quot;looping&quot; or &quot;loopy&quot; delivery. Also, the ball travels approximately straight on, as compared to a wrist spin or finger spin stock delivery that breaks to the left or right on impact. A batsman may easily be deceived by the ball, particularly given that the action is quite similar to the stock delivery. Compared to the stock delivery, the ball will dip in flight, and land shorter than expected. The majority of the time, this increased angle of descent will lead to an increased bounce, making it a particularly difficult ball to attack. Tactically, a bowler will bowl topspinners to draw a batsman forward before using the dip and extra bounce to deceive them. In particular, batsmen looking to sweep or drive are vulnerable as the bounce can defeat them and lead to a catch. However, on an underprepared soft wicket, the spin on the ball may actually cause it to grip and shoot through low. Again, this will make it a particularly difficult delivery for the batsman to deal with.

==Finger spin==
The topspinner is a common variation is the arsenal of the finger spinner. The most common method of delivery is for the ball to be delivered with the arm supinated further than the stock delivery with the side of the hand pointing towards the batsman, and the ball is released off the outside of the first finger, in such a way that it spins directly towards the batsman. However, a second method used by Muttiah Muralitharan is for the arm to be rotated further so that the back of the hand is facing the batsman; the ball is then given a large amount of spin by flexion of the wrist. The right-handed offspinner bowler will look to pitch this delivery on or outside off-stump, in anticipation that the batsman will play for the turn and give an edge behind the wicket. The left-arm orthodox bowler will typically bowl the ball on middle stump, looking to beat the inside edge of the bat and gain a bowled or lbw dismissal. Muttiah Muralitharan, Tim May, and Harbhajan Singh are examples of offspinners who frequently used this delivery.

==Wrist spin==

The topspinner is a common variation in the arsenal of the wrist spinner, and typically the first variation taught to young wrist spin bowlers after they have mastered their stock delivery. The most common method of delivery is for the ball to be delivered with the arm pronated further than the stock delivery with the side of the hand pointing towards the batsman, and the ball is released off the third finger, in such as way that it spins directly towards the batsman. The right-arm legspin bowler will typically bowl the ball on middle stump, looking to beat the inside edge of the bat and gain a bowled or lbw dismissal. To a left-handed batsman, he will look to use the ball to gain an outside edge and dismiss the batsman caught. Shane Warne and Anil Kumble are example of modern wrist spinners who frequently bowled the topspinner.

<doc id="88821" wikidata="Q800579" url="?curid=88821" title="Bristol Temple Meads railway station">
<text>Bristol Temple Meads is the oldest and largest railway station in Bristol, England. It is located away from London Paddington. It is an important transport hub for public transport in the city; there are bus services to many parts of the city and surrounding districts, with a ferry to the city centre. It is the busiest station in South West England, and the fifth busiest in Southern England outside of London. Bristol&#x27;s other major station, Bristol Parkway, is a more recent station on the northern outskirts of the conurbation.

Temple Meads was opened on 31 August 1840, as the western terminus of the Great Western Railway. The railway, including Temple Meads, was the first to be designed by the British engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Soon, the station was also used by the Bristol and Exeter Railway, the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, the Bristol Harbour Railway and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway. To accommodate the increasing number of trains, the station was expanded in the 1870s by Francis Fox and again between 1930 and 1935 by Percy Emerson Culverhouse. Brunel&#x27;s terminus is no longer part of the operational station. The historical significance of the station has been noted and most of the site is Grade I listed.

Temple Meads, which has 13 active platforms across eight tracks, is managed by Network Rail. Most services are operated by the present-day Great Western Railway, with others by CrossCountry.

==History==
The name &quot;Temple Meads&quot; derives from the nearby Temple Church, which was gutted by bombing during the Second World War. The word &quot;meads&quot; is a derivation of &quot;mæd&quot;, an Old English variation of &quot;mædwe&quot;, meadow, referring to the water meadows alongside the River Avon that were part of Temple parish. As late as 1820 the site was undeveloped pasture outside the boundaries of the old city, some distance from the commercial centre. It lay between the Floating Harbour and the city&#x27;s cattle market, which was built in 1830.

===Brunel&#x27;s station===

The original terminus was built in 1839–41 for the Great Western Railway (GWR), the first passenger railway in Bristol, and was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the railway&#x27;s engineer. It was built to accommodate Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge. The station was on a viaduct to raise it above the level of the Floating Harbour and River Avon, the latter being crossed via the Grade I listed Avon Bridge. The station was covered by a train shed, extended beyond the platforms by into a storage area and engine shed, fronted by an office building in the Tudor style. Train services to Bath commenced on 31 August 1840 and were extended to Paddington on 30 June 1841 following the completion of Box Tunnel.
A few weeks before the start of the services to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B&amp;ER) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.

===Bristol and Exeter Railway station===

In 1845 the B&amp;ER built its own station at right angles to the GWR station and an &quot;express platform&quot; on the curve linking the two lines so that through trains no longer had to reverse. The wooden B&amp;ER station was known locally as &quot;The Cowshed&quot;; but a grand headquarters was built at street level on the west side of its station in 1852–54 to the Jacobean designs of Samuel Fripp. The Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway opened a branch off the Bristol and Exeter line west of the city on 18 April 1867, the trains being operated by the B&amp;ER and using its platforms at Temple Meads.

In 1850 an engine shed was opened on the south bank of the River Avon on the east side of the line to the B&amp;ER station. Between 1859 and 1875, 23 engines were built in the workshops attached to the shed, including several distinctive Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-4T locomotives.
===Goods stations===

The GWR built a goods shed on the north side of the station adjacent to the Floating Harbour, with a small dock for transhipment of goods to barges (not seagoing ships, as the wharf was upstream of Bristol Bridge). Wagons had to be lowered to the goods shed on hoists. On 11 March 1872, a direct connection to the harbour was made in the form of the Bristol Harbour Railway, a joint operation of the three railways, which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, across the street outside on a bridge, and descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliffe on its way to a wharf downstream of Bristol Bridge. The southern end of the tunnel can still be seen between the bottom of Guinea Street and the Ostritch public house. The footbridge across the entrance to Bathhurst Basin is on the site of the railway bascule bridge.

The B&amp;ER had a goods depot at Pylle Hill (south of the station) from 1850, and the MR had an independent yard at Avonside Wharf on the opposite side of the Floating Harbour from 1858.

===Effects of the change of gauge===
On 29 May 1854 the Midland Railway laid a third rail along their line to Gloucester to provide mixed gauge so that it could operate standard gauge passenger trains while broad gauge goods trains could still run to collieries north of Bristol. Sidings at South Wales Junction allowed traffic to be transhipped between wagons on the two different gauges. The GWR continued to operate its trains on the broad gauge, but on 3 September 1873 it opened the standard gauge Bristol and North Somerset Railway. This had a junction nearly from the station on the London line and so mixed gauge was extended to that point. During the following year mixed gauge track was continued beyond Bath in connection with the conversion of the Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway to standard gauge. Mixed gauge was laid through Box Tunnel on 16 May 1875 and so standard gauge trains could run to London, although broad gauge was retained west of Temple Meads and through trains from London to Penzance and other stations in Devon and Cornwall continued to be broad gauge. Goods traffic was transhipped between the two gauges in the B&amp;ER yard at Pylle Hill.

The B&amp;ER converted the line to Taunton to mixed gauge by 1 June 1875, but the remainder of the line to Exeter was not done until 1 March 1876, three months after the B&amp;ER had amalgamated with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard gauge on 21 May 1892 so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard gauge layout. This allowed the through station to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.

===1870s expansion===

The additional railway routes put the two short platforms of Brunel&#x27;s terminus under pressure and a scheme was developed to extend the station. An enabling Act of Parliament for a new Bristol Joint Station was passed in 1865, and between 1871 and 1878 the station was extensively rebuilt by a committee formed of the three principal railway companies that used the station. Brunel&#x27;s platforms were extended by towards London, and a new three-platform through station was built on the site of the express platform, while the B&amp;ER station was closed and the site used for a new carriage shed. From the 1960s, the work was usually attributed to Brunel&#x27;s former associate Matthew Digby Wyatt, but in 2020 it was established to be by Bristol architect Henry Lloyd under the superintendence of Francis Fox, the engineer of the B&amp;ER. The curved wrought-iron train shed over the new through platforms was long on the platform wall. The goods depot was rebuilt, with the inconvenient wagon hoists replaced by a steep incline from the east end of Temple Meads, which meant that the sidings in the goods shed were at right angles to their original alignment; and the barge dock was filled in.

Trains on the Bristol and South Wales Union and the Midland routes operated from the terminal platforms, while the GWR used the new through platforms. The capital costs of the new work were split 4/14 GWR/B&amp;ER and 10/14 MR, and operating costs were split GWR 3/8, MR 3/8 and B&amp;ER 2/8. Hence, when the GWR absorbed the B&amp;ER in 1876 the split became GWR 5/8 and MR (later LMS) 3/8, until nationalisation on 1 January 1948.

===Twentieth-century changes===

In 1924 the goods depot was rebuilt with 15 platforms, each long. Large warehousing and cellar space was provided to store goods, although by this time another city centre goods depot had been opened at Canons Marsh.

Between 1930 and 1935 the through station was expanded under the direction of the GWR&#x27;s chief architect P E Culverhouse, in Art Deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.

As part of this work, four manual signal boxes were replaced by three power signal boxes, and the semaphore signals and mechanical point linkages were replaced by colour light signals and point motors. The new Bristol Temple Meads East box was the largest on the GWR, with 368 miniature levers operated by three signalmen assisted by a &quot;booking boy&quot;. The other two boxes were at Bristol Temple Meads West, and controlling the movements in and out of the new Bath Road Depot, which replaced the old B&amp;ER locomotive works in 1934.

During World War II the station was bombed, which led to the destruction of the wooden spire of the clock tower above the ticket office on 3 January 1941. Gas lighting was replaced by fluorescent electric lights in 1960.

Bristol Panel Signal Box was built on the site of Platform 14. When opened, it controlled 280 multiple-aspect signals and 243 motor-worked points on of route, the largest area controlled by a single signal box on British Rail at the time.

The construction of this signal box, completed in 1970, involved the demolition of almost half of the 1870s extension to Brunel&#x27;s terminus and completely blocked rail access to the Old Station.

A second main-line station serving the city, , opened in 1972. It is on the northern outskirts of the conurbation close to the M32 motorway and was designed as a park and ride facility for long-distance travellers.

In the late 1960s the Royal Mail built a mail conveyor at the northern end of the station, with significant aesthetic impact. This was out of use for many years following the transfer of Royal Mail&#x27;s activities to the West of England Mail Centre at Filton and the opening of the short-lived Railnet Hub next to Bristol Parkway station in May 2000. It was finally dismantled in stages and removed between October and December 2014. In 1990/91, £2 million was spent by InterCity on a renovation of the main train shed and another £7 million on restoring some of the older areas of the station, including the refurbishment of the subway and construction of new retail outlets. The shorter of the two 1935 platform islands had been used only for parcels traffic since the 1960s but was temporarily brought back into passenger use during this work. It was fully restored for passenger use in 2001.

In August 1998, a 15-month, £7 million project commenced with work performed on the external facade, clocktower, roof and paving. As part of this work, the quarry from which the dolomite stone had originally been extracted was reopened in Abbots Leigh.



===Closure of lines===
Passenger traffic on the old North Somerset line ceased on 2 November 1959, and many more closures followed after the publication of Dr Beeching&#x27;s &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; in 1963. The connection to the Bristol Harbour Railway was closed on 6 January 1964; passenger trains to Portishead were withdrawn on 7 September 1964; and most local services in the north of the city were withdrawn on 23 November 1964. The following year saw local services on the Midland route to Gloucester withdrawn and the Midland route to via was closed on 7 March 1966. and on the line towards Bath survived until 5 January 1970.

On 12 September 1965, the terminal platforms were closed. This allowed the platforms to be renumbered with the order reversed (see list below). The redundant train shed became a covered car park in February of the following year, but from 1989 until 1999 the original (Brunel) part was an interactive science centre known as The Exploratory and an exhibition space. From 2002 to 2008, it housed the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum. , the shed, now known as the Passenger Shed, is a venue for events such as conferences and weddings.



===Enterprise zone and station redevelopment===
Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, an enterprise zone with an area of centred on Temple Meads, was announced in 2011, and launched in 2012. Network Rail is a partner in coordinating development in the zone. In November 2012, Network Rail announced a £100 million redevelopment of the station, with two unused platforms to be opened up. Station Approach Road will be turned into a public square and the station&#x27;s main entrance moved to the north side. A large bridge above the tracks at the east end of the station which was erected in the 1970s for postal traffic was demolished at Christmas 2014. In November 2016, the University of Bristol announced that it plans to build a Temple Quarter Campus to the east of the station, replacing the derelict sorting office which was formerly connected to the station by the bridge.

Bristol and Exeter House has been redeveloped by TCN UK as a business hub for small and medium-sized enterprises. Part of Brunel&#x27;s station has found a new use in a redevelopment by the City Council, the University of Bristol and the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership. Opened in 2013 as the Engine Shed, it hosts business incubators for startups.

Plans to build a 12,000-capacity arena on the former site of the Bristol Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot, to the south of the station, were cancelled in 2018.

===21st century===
The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol was part of electrification plans first announced by the UK government in 2009. However, because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the government announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including electrification south-west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham, and between Temple Meads and Bristol Parkway. Although this left Temple Meads un-electrified, the Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate on diesel around Bristol and can use electricity where the electrification work is complete. The electrification plans do not extend west of Bristol, so local services will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.

The Portishead branch line, which runs along the south side of the River Avon from a junction just beyond is proposed to be reopened. There is an aspiration of two trains per hour between and Temple Meads in peak periods, possibly calling at and Parson Street. The line was built in the 1860s but closed to passenger traffic in 1964, leaving Portishead as one of Britain&#x27;s largest towns without a railway station. The line was reopened for freight traffic to serve Royal Portbury Docks in 2001, and the restoration of passenger traffic is considered part of the Greater Bristol Metro scheme, which was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of a City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government.

The Metro scheme could also see the reopening of the Henbury Loop Line to passengers, with the possibility of services from Temple Meads to via and . Plans for a loop were rejected by the West of England Joint Transport Board, but in July 2015 Bristol City Councillors voted to send the decision back to the board for further discussion.

On 1 April 2014, Network Rail took over management of the station from First Great Western.

In December 2021, South Western Railway services to London Waterloo were withdrawn, followed by GWR services to Brighton in 2022. In 2024, direct services to were reintroduced by GWR on a trial basis on Saturdays only.

A new station reception was opened in 2023, replacing the information desk on platform three.

==== Refurbishment ====
In 2013, it was announced that the station roof would be refurbished as part of a scheme to transform the station over the 25 years commencing 2013. In September 2021, foundations were installed for a planned eastern entrance to the station. Following the erection of scaffolding inside the station, work on the roof began in April 2022.

==Description==
===Approaches===

Although it is now possible to reach the station through the Temple Quay office development (on the site of the goods shed) or from the Bristol Ferry Boat Company landing stage on the Floating Harbour, the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Tudor-style offices, later used by the former British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.

Opposite these offices are the Grosvenor Hotel and the derelict George Railway Hotel, which were built in the 1870s, on either side of the site of the Bristol Harbour Railway bridge. A modern pub named The Reckless Engineer as a tribute to Brunel faces the approach road to the station.
On the right of the Station Approach but at a lower level is the B&amp;ER office building designed by Samuel Fripp; the 1930s offices known as &quot;Collett House&quot; (named after Charles Collett) and a disused parcels depot lie beyond. On the left is Brunel&#x27;s original station building. The train shed is wide with a wooden box-frame roof and cast iron columns disguised as hammerbeams above Tudor arches. It is believed to be the widest hammerbeam roof in England and, along with most of the station, is a Grade 1 listed building, and forms part of a proposed Great Western Railway World Heritage Site. At the top of the slope an entrance on the left to the covered car park marks the junction between the original terminus and Fox&#x27;s 1870s extension.

Ahead is the turreted main station building, and to the right a flat area marks the site of the B&amp;ER station. The tunnel beneath this area was the route for passengers to and from the Down platform from 1878 until the station was enlarged in 1935.

Outside the old station building is a statue of Brunel, moved here in 2021 but first erected in the city centre in 1982.

===Station===
Entering the main building, the ticket office and ticket machines are immediately ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry is on the left; a newsagent is on the right, next to the platform entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show arrival and departure information for all platforms, as do displays on each of the platforms.

It is located from London Paddington.
There are 13 numbered platforms serving 8 tracks. The platforms are numbered from 1–15 with 2 and 14 omitted. Platforms 1, 13 and 15 do not share tracks with any other platform. Platforms 3–12 consist of five tracks that are each subdivided into a pair of numbered platforms. Of those, the odd numbered platforms are at the north end of the station, while even numbers are at the south end. All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station.

Entrance to the platforms is controlled by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar is on the left and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel&#x27;s 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Bristol Barton Hill TMD can be seen in the distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.
On the right of the entrance is the subway that links all the platforms, reached either by steps or lift; it houses the main public toilets, automated teller machines (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all platform islands except 13–15). A passenger information office and lounge are above the subway, the British Transport Police office and cycle racks are beyond, and at the western end is Platform 4, used by only a few trains. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but not signalled for passenger trains and used only for stabling empty trains, as is the former Motorail unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock, occasionally used for stabling engineers&#x27; on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out of sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the A4 out of the city.

The first island platform comprises platforms 5 to 8. Platform 5 is inside the main train shed while 6 is a southerly extension and 7 and 8 were added outside the supporting wall in the 1930s. Platform 5 is used by trains towards Cardiff and platform 7 to Portsmouth; platforms 6 and 8 are the main platforms for Weston-super-Mare and stations to Penzance. Between platforms 5 and 7 are the two spur sidings that are long enough to stable a single Class 153 DMU.

The third island platform comprises platforms 9 to 12 and also dates from the 1930s. It is longer than platforms 5–8 but the rear of a High Speed Train on the west end platforms will block part of the east end platform. A wide variety of trains use these platforms, including to and from London Paddington and Weymouth.

The final island platform is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15: 15 is used by most trains from Paddington that continue westwards to Weston-super-Mare or beyond. Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from Paddington, some local services and occasionally by CrossCountry. There is another siding beyond platform 15 that used to be the In/out Road for Bristol Bath Road TMD. This depot has been demolished. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up Through line and the Middle Siding, the latter is often used to stable Mark 1 carriages between &quot;Torbay Express&quot; duties in the summer months. The Down Through line runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.

To the north of the station lies Arriva TrainCare&#x27;s Barton Hill TMD, and to the south-east of the station lies St Philip&#x27;s Marsh depot which services the Great Western Railway fleet. This is accessible from both ends of Temple Meads station.

Other facilities include pay phones, public Wi-Fi, a post box, photo booth, and passenger assistance such as information points, waiting rooms, a lost property office, first aid room, and CCTV.

In &quot;Britain&#x27;s 100 Best Railway Stations&quot; by Simon Jenkins, the station was one of only ten to be awarded five stars.

<text>&#x27; (&#x27;Thou Olden, Thou Free&#x27;), from its first verse, originally titled &#x27; (&#x27;Song to the North&#x27;), is the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of Sweden. Its music is based on a Swedish folk tune with lyrics written by Swedish antiquarian Richard Dybeck in 1844.

The song is notable for neither mentioning nor referring to Sweden specifically at all, or even a nation; making the Polish national anthem the only national anthem to mention Sweden.

== De facto national anthem ==
Although the Swedish constitution makes no mention of a national anthem, &quot;&quot; enjoys universal recognition and is used, for example, at government ceremonies as well as sporting events. It first began to win recognition as a song in the 1890s, and the issue of its status was debated back and forth up until the 1930s. In 1938, the Swedish public service radio company Sveriges Radio started playing it in the evenings at the end of transmission, which marked the beginning of the &quot;de facto&quot; status as national anthem the song has had since.

Despite the belief that it was adopted as the national anthem in 1866, no such recognition has ever been officially accorded. A kind of official recognition came in 1893, when King Oscar II rose in honor when the song was played. In 2000, a Riksdag committee rejected a proposal to give the song official status as &quot;unnecessary&quot;. The committee concluded that the song has been established as the national anthem by the people, not by the political system, and that it is preferable to keep it that way.

== History ==
The original lyrics were written by Richard Dybeck in 1844, to the melody of a variant of the ballad &quot;&quot; (). The ballad type is classified as D 280 in The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad; the variant from Västmanland that Dybeck reproduced is classified as SMB 133 G. It was recorded by Rosa Wretman at the beginning of the 1840s. Dybeck published the traditional text in &quot;Folk-lore I&quot;, and the melody in 1845 in his &quot;Runa&quot;, where he also published his new text &quot;Sång till Norden&quot; (Song for/to the North).

Dybeck himself originally wrote the beginning as &quot; (), but in the late 1850s, he changed the lyrics to &quot;. The song was already published in several song books and sung with &quot;, but a priest who had known Dybeck took the opportunity to inform the singer most associated with the song, opera singer , about the change in the year 1900. From that point on, printings of the &quot; version ceased to be seen in song books, but a recording from 1905 where it is sung with &quot;friska&quot; still exists. The Swedish composer Edvin Kallstenius made an orchestral arrangement of the song in 1933.

By the early 20th century, many regarded the song unsuitable as a national anthem. From the 1890s, it was included in the &quot;patriotic songs&quot; section of song books, but up to the 1920s it was occasionally published just as &quot;folk music&quot;. In 1899, a contest to produce a national anthem was held. It led to Verner von Heidenstam writing &quot;Sverige&quot;, but did not lead to a new national anthem.

Patriotic sentiment is notably absent from the text of the original two verses, due to their being written in the spirit of Scandinavism popular at the time. After the song started to acquire its informal status as the national anthem, various people wrote additional verses to increase the &quot;Swedish-ness&quot; of the song. The aforementioned Lundqvist wrote his own third verse beginning with &quot; (); wrote four verses beginning with &quot; (); and Louise Ahlén with two verses. However, these are not accepted as part of the anthem, and are not normally published or sung.

== Lyrics ==
=== Swedish lyrics (Du gamla, du fria) ===

Richard Dybeck&#x27;s original text, sourced from (1888):

Richard Dybeck&#x27;s revised text, i.e. the modern formal version, sourced from Nu ska vi sjunga (1943):

=== Finnish lyrics (Pohjolanmaa) ===
&quot;Pohjolanmaa&quot; (&#x27;Nordic land&#x27;) is the &quot;de facto&quot; Finnish version of the song, as recognized by the Swedish National Agency for Education, originally translated by Finnish writer (1862–1927); text sourced from the Helsinki Adult Education Centre&#x27;s songbook (1928):

=== Southern Sámi lyrics ===
A version in Southern Sámi was recorded by Swedish national radio in 1938, performed by the &#x27;Skarvsjöby&#x27; nomad school (1926–1945) in Storuman Municipality, Sweden. Author of the lyrics is unknown; when the recording was made, Hanna Bergeman was the teacher of class 1–3, and Helfrid Leijer the teacher of class 4–6. Text sourced from the manual captions of a youtube video:

=== Estonian lyrics ===
An Estonian version, a free translation by a &quot;A. Mutso&quot;, was featured in an Estonian internet article on &quot;Nordic musicians (19th – early 20th centuries)&quot;, published around the mid 2000s, on the now defunct site hot.ee, written by a &#x27;Galina Kulikova&#x27;. Both names appear in the 2002–2004 yearbooks of the Estonian Academy of Music, as well as the 2010–2011 yearbook of Heino Eller Tartu Music College: Galina Kulikova – lektor, Andres Mutso (A. Mutso) – accompanyist/pianist, indicating a connection between the names in the Estonian musical sphere. The latter yearbook provides insight at Kulikova being a lecturer in music history and thereof, giving support to her being the author of the article &quot;Nordic musicians (19th – early 20th centuries)&quot;, and by extension, her colleague &#x27;Andres Mutso&#x27; being the same A. Mutso as credited with writing the Estonian version.

The latter yearbook gives some background on Andres Mutso, giving some reputability to the Estonian version. In 1992 he graduated from Heino Eller Tartu Music College in the piano class of A. Antzon, in 1997 from the Estonian Academy of Music as a soloist in the piano class of professor A. Juozapenaite-Eesmaa. Since 1997 he has been working as a piano teacher and concertmaster at the Heino Eller Tartu Music College. In 2002–2005 he worked as a concertmaster for singers at the Estonian Academy of Music. In 2007 Andres Mutso was a scholarship holder of the International Wagner Society.

<text>AmigaDOS is the disk operating system of the AmigaOS, which includes file systems, file and directory manipulation, the command-line interface, and file redirection.

In AmigaOS 1.x, AmigaDOS is based on a TRIPOS port by MetaComCo, written in BCPL. BCPL does not use native pointers, so the more advanced functionality of the operating system was difficult to use and error-prone. The third-party &quot;AmigaDOS Resource Project&quot; (ARP, formerly the &quot;AmigaDOS Replacement Project&quot;), a project begun by Amiga developer Charlie Heath, replaced many of the BCPL utilities with smaller, more sophisticated equivalents written in C and assembler, and provided a wrapper library, codice_1. This eliminated the interfacing problems in applications by automatically performing conversions from native pointers (such as those used by C or assembler) to BCPL equivalents and vice versa for all AmigaDOS functions.

From AmigaOS 2.x onwards, AmigaDOS was rewritten in C, retaining 1.x compatibility where possible. Starting with AmigaOS 4, AmigaDOS abandoned its legacy with BCPL. Starting from AmigaOS 4.1, AmigaDOS has been extended with 64-bit file-access support.

==Console==
The Amiga console is a standard Amiga virtual device, normally assigned to &quot;CON:&quot; and driven by &quot;console.handler&quot;. It was developed from a primitive interface in AmigaOS 1.1, and became stable with versions 1.2 and 1.3, when it started to be known as AmigaShell and its original handler was replaced by &quot;newconsole.handler&quot; (&quot;NEWCON:&quot;).

The console has various features that were considered up to date when it was created in 1985, like command template help, redirection to null (&quot;NIL:&quot;), and ANSI color terminal. The new console handler – which was implemented in release 1.2 – allows many more features, such as command history, pipelines, and automatic creation of files when output is redirected. When TCP/IP stacks like AmiTCP were released in the early 1990s, the console could also receive redirection from Internet-enabled Amiga device handlers (e.g., &quot;TCP:&quot;, ).

Unlike other systems originally launched in the mid-1980s, AmigaDOS does not implement a proprietary character set; the developers chose to use the ANSI–ISO standard ISO-8859-1 (Latin 1), which includes the ASCII character set. As in Unix systems, the Amiga console accepts only linefeed (&quot;LF&quot;) as an end-of-line (&quot;EOL&quot;) character. The Amiga console has support for accented characters as well as for characters created by combinations of &#x27;dead keys&#x27; on the keyboard.

==Syntax of AmigaDOS commands==
This is an example of typical AmigaDOS command syntax:
1&gt; Dir DF0:
:Without entering the directory tree, this shows the content of a directory of a floppy disk and lists subdirectories as well.
1&gt; Dir SYS: ALL
:The argument &quot;&quot;ALL&quot; causes the command to show the entire content of a volume or device, entering and expanding all directory trees. &quot;SYS:&quot; is a default name that is assigned to the boot device, regardless of its physical name.

===Command redirection===
AmigaDOS can redirect the output of a command to files, pipes, a printer, the null device, and other Amiga devices.
1&gt; Dir &gt; SPEAK: ALL
:Redirects the output of the &quot;dir&quot; command to the speech synthesis handler. The colon character &quot;:&quot;&quot; indicates that &quot;SPEAK:&quot; points to an AmigaDOS device. While a typical use for a device is file systems, special-purpose device names such as this are commonly used in the system.

===Command template===
AmigaDOS commands are expected to provide a standard &quot;template&quot; that describes the arguments they can accept. This can be used as a basic &quot;help&quot; feature for commands, although third-party replacement console handlers and shells, such as Bash or Zshell (ported from Unix), or KingCON often provide more verbose help for built-in commands.

On requesting the template for the command &quot;Copy&quot;, the following output is obtained:
1&gt; Copy ?
 FROM, TO/A, ALL/S, QUIET/S
:This string means that the user must use this command in conjunction with &quot;FROM&quot; and &quot;TO&quot; arguments, where the latter is compulsory (). The argument keywords &quot;ALL&quot; and &quot;QUIET&quot; are switches () and change the results of the command &quot;Copy&quot; (&quot;ALL&quot; causes all files in a directory to be copied, while &quot;QUIET&quot; will cause the command to generate no output).

By reading this template, a user can know that the following syntax is acceptable for the command:
1&gt; Copy DF0:Filename TO DH0:Directory/Filename
===Breaking commands and pausing console output===
A user can terminate a program by invoking the key combination or . Pressing or any printing character on the keyboard suspends the console output. Output may be resumed by pressing the key (to delete all of the input) or by pressing (which will cause the input to be processed as a command as soon as the current command stops running).

===Wildcard characters===
Like other operating systems, AmigaDOS also provides wildcard characters that are substitutes for any character or any sequence of random characters in a string. Here is an example of wildcard characters in AmigaDOS commands:
1&gt; Dir #?.info
:searches the current directory for any file containing &quot;.info&quot; at its end as suffix, and displays only these files in the output.

The parsing of this is as follows. The &quot;?&quot; wildcard indicates &quot;any character&quot;. Prefixing this with a &quot;#&quot; indicates &quot;any number of repetitions&quot;. This can be viewed as analogous to the regular expression &quot;.*&quot;.

==Scripting==
AmigaDOS also has the feature of dealing with batch programming, which it calls &quot;script&quot; programming, and has a number of commands such as Echo, If, Then, EndIf, Val, and Skip to deal with structured script programming. Scripts are text-based files and can be created with AmigaDOS&#x27;s internal text editor program, called Ed (unrelated to Unix&#x27;s Ed), or with any other third-party text editor. To invoke a script program, AmigaDOS uses the command Execute.
1&gt; Execute myscript
This executes the script called &quot;myscript&quot;.

This method of executing scripts keeps the console window busy until the script has finished its scheduled job. Users cannot interact with the console window until the script ends or until they interrupt it.

While:

1&gt; Run Execute myscript
The AmigaDOS command Run executes any DOS command or any kind of program and keeps the console free for further input.

===Protection bits===
Protection bits are flags that files, links and directories have in the filesystem. To change them one can either use the command Protect, or use the Information entry from the Icons menu in Workbench on selected files. AmigaDOS supports the following set of protection bits (abbreviated as HSPARWED):
*H = Hold (reentrant commands with the P-bit set will automatically become resident on first execution. Requires E, P and R bits set to work. Does &quot;not&quot; mean &quot;Hide&quot;. See below.)
*S = Script (Batch file. Requires E and R bits set to work.) If this protection bit is set on, then AmigaDOS is able to recognize and automatically run a script by simply invoking its name. Without S bit scripts can still be launched using the Execute command.
*P = Pure (indicates reentrant commands that can be made resident in RAM and then no longer need to be loaded any time from flash drives, hard disks or any other media device. Requires E and R bits set to work.)
*A = Archive (Archived bit, used by various backup programs to indicate that a file has been backed up)
*R = Read (Permission to read the file, link or content of directory)
*W = Write (Permission to write the file, link or inside a directory)
*E = Execute (Permission to execute the file or enter the directory. All commands need this bit set, or they won&#x27;t run. Requires R bit set to work.)
*D = Delete (Permission to delete the file, link or directory)

The H-bit has often been misunderstood to mean &quot;Hide&quot;. In Smart File System (SFS) files and directories with H-bit set are hidden from the system. It is still possible access hidden files but they don&#x27;t appear in any directory listings.

Demonstration of H-bit in action:

AmigaPrompt&gt; which list
Workbench:C/List
AmigaPrompt&gt; list workbench:c/list
Directory &quot;workbench:c&quot; on Thursday 30-Oct-08
list 6464 --p-rwed 25-Feb-02 22:30:00
1 file - 14 blocks used
AmigaPrompt&gt; which list
Workbench:C/List
AmigaPrompt&gt; protect workbench:c/list +h
AmigaPrompt&gt; which list
Workbench:C/List
AmigaPrompt&gt; list workbench:c/list
Directory &quot;workbench:c&quot; on Thursday 30-Oct-08
list 6464 h-p-rwed 25-Feb-02 22:30:00
1 file - 14 blocks used
AmigaPrompt&gt; which list
RES list
:Notice how the list command becomes resident after execution when the H-bit is set.

===Local and global variables===
As any other DOS, Amiga deals with environment variables as used in batch programming.

There are both global and local variables, and they are referred to with a dollar sign in front of the variable name, for example $myvar. Global variables are available system-wide; local variables are only valid in the current shell. In case of name collision, local variables have precedence over global variables. Global variables can be set using the command SetEnv, while local variables can be set using the command Set. There are also the commands GetEnv and Get that can be used to print out global and local variables.

The examples below demonstrate simple usage:
1&gt; setenv foo blapp
1&gt; echo $foo
blapp
1&gt; set foo bar
1&gt; echo $foo
bar
1&gt; getenv foo
blapp
1&gt; get foo
bar
1&gt; type ENV:foo
blapp
1&gt; setenv save foo $foo
1&gt; type ENV:foo
bar
1&gt; type ENVARC:foo
bar

: If the save flag of the SetEnv command is set, this variable is saved permanently in ENVARC: and remains available even after the current session has ended or the system has been restarted.

Global variables are kept as files in ENV:, and optionally saved on disk in ENVARC: to survive reboot and power cycling. ENV: is by default an assign to RAM:Env, and ENVARC: is an assign to SYS:Prefs/Env-archive where SYS: refers to the boot device. On bootup, the content of ENVARC: is copied to ENV: for accessibility.

When programming AmigaDOS scripts, one must keep in mind that global variables are system-wide. All script-internal variables shall be set using local variables, or one risks conflicts over global variables between scripts. Also, global variables require filesystem access, which typically makes them slower to access than local variables.

Since ENVARC: is also used to store other system settings than just string variables (such as system settings, default icons and more), it tends to grow large over time, and copying everything over to ENV: located on RAM disk becomes expensive. This has led to alternative ways to set up ENV: by using dedicated ramdisk handlers that only copy files over from ENVARC: when the files are requested. Examples of such handlers are and. 

An example demonstrating creative abuse of global variables as well as Lab and Skip is the AmigaDOS variant of the infamous GOTO.

==Case sensitivity==
AmigaDOS is in general case-insensitive. Indicating a device as &quot;Dh0:&quot;, &quot;DH0:&quot; or &quot;dh0:&quot; always refers to the same partition; however, for file and directory names, this is filesystem-dependent, and some filesystems allow case sensitivity as a flag upon formatting. An example of such a file system is Smart File System. This is very convenient when dealing with software ported over from the mostly case-sensitive Un*x world, but causes much confusion for native Amiga applications, which assume case insensitivity. Advanced users will hence typically only use the case sensitivity flag for file systems used for software originating from Un*x.

Re-casing of file, directory and volume names is allowed using ordinary methods; the commands &quot;rename foo Foo&quot; and &quot;relabel Bar: bAr:&quot; are valid and do exactly what is expected, in contrast to for example on Linux, where &quot;mv foo Foo&quot; results in the error message &quot;mv: `foo&#x27; and `Foo&#x27; are the same file&quot; on case-insensitive filesystems like VFAT.

==Volume naming conventions==
Partitions and physical drives are typically referred to as &quot;DF0:&quot; (floppy drive 0), &quot;DH0:&quot; (hard drive 0), etc. However, unlike many operating systems, outside of built-in physical hardware devices like &quot;DF0:&quot; or &quot;HD0:&quot;, the names of the single disks, volumes and partitions are totally arbitrary: for example a hard disk partition could be named &quot;Work&quot; or &quot;System&quot;, or anything else at the time of its creation. Volume names can be used in place of the corresponding device names, so a disk partition on device &quot;DH0:&quot; called &quot;Workbench&quot; could be accessed either with the name &quot;DH0:&quot; or &quot;Workbench:&quot;. Users must indicate to the system that &quot;&quot;Workbench&quot; is the volume &quot;Workbench:&quot; by always typing the colon &quot;:&quot;&quot; when they are entering information in a requester form or into AmigaShell.

If an accessed volume name cannot be found, the operating system will prompt the user to insert the disk with the given volume name, or allow the user to cancel the operation.

In addition, logical device names can be set with the &quot;assign&quot; command to any directory or device; programs often assigned a virtual volume name to their installation directory (for instance, a fictional word processor called &quot;Writer&quot; might assign &quot;Writer:&quot; to &quot;DH0:Productivity/Writer&quot;). This allows for easy relocation of installed programs. The default name &quot;SYS:&quot; is used to refer to the volume that the system was booted from. Various other default names are provided to refer to important system locations. e.g. &quot;S:&quot; for startup scripts, &quot;C:&quot; for AmigaDOS commands, &quot;FONTS:&quot; for installed fonts, etc.

Assignment of volume labels can also be set on multiple directories, which will be treated as a union of their contents. For example, &quot;FONTS:&quot; might be assigned to &quot;SYS:Fonts&quot;, then extended to include, for example, &quot;Work:UserFonts&quot; using the &quot;add&quot; option of the AmigaDos &quot;assign&quot; command. The system would then permit use of fonts installed in either directory. Listing &quot;FONTS:&quot; would show the files from both locations.

==Conventions of names and typical behaviour of virtual devices==
The physical device shares the same floppy drive mechanics with , which is the CrossDOS virtual device capable of reading PC formatted floppy disks. When any PC formatted floppy disk is inserted into the floppy drive, then the floppy Amiga icon will change to indicate that the disk is unknown to the normal Amiga device, and it will show four question marks as the standard &quot;unknown&quot; volume name, while the icon will appear revealing the name of the PC formatted disk. Any disk change with Amiga formatted disks will invert this behaviour.

== File systems ==
AmigaDOS supports various filesystems and variants. The first filesystem was simply called Amiga FileSystem, and was suitable mainly for floppy disks, because it did not support automatic booting from hard disks (on floppy, booting was done using code from the bootblock). It was soon replaced by FastFileSystem (FFS), and hence the original filesystem was known by the name of &quot;Old&quot; FileSystem (OFS). FFS was more efficient on space and quite measurably faster than OFS, hence the name.

With AmigaOS 2.x, FFS became an official part of the OS and was soon expanded to recognise cached partitions, international partitions allowing accented characters in file and partition names, and finally (with MorphOS and AmigaOS 4) long filenames, up to 108 characters (from 31).

Both AmigaOS 4.x and MorphOS featured a new version of FFS called FastFileSystem 2. FFS2 incorporated all of the features of the original FFS including, as its author put it, &quot;some minor changes&quot;. In order to preserve backwards compatibility, there were no major structural changes. (However, FF2 on AmigaOS 4.1 differs in that it can expand its features and capabilities with the aid of plug-ins). As with FFS2, the AmigaOS 4 and MorphOS version of Smart FileSystem is a fork of original SFS and are not 100% compatible with it.

Other filesystems like FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 from Windows or ext2 from Linux are available through easily installable (drag and drop) system libraries or third party modules such as FAT95 (features read/write support), which can be found on the Aminet software repository. MorphOS 2 has built-in support for FAT filesystems.

AmigaOS 4.1 adopted a new filesystem called JXFS capable to support partitions over a terabyte of size.

Alternate filesystems from third-party manufacturers include Professional FileSystem, which is a filesystem with an easy structure, based on metadata, allowing high internal coherence, capable of defragmenting itself on the fly, and does not require to be unmounted before being mounted again; and Smart FileSystem which is a journaling filesystem which performs journaled activities during system inactivities, and has been chosen by MorphOS as its standard filesystem.

=== Official variants of Amiga filesystems ===
Old File System/Fast File System
*OFS (DOS0)
*FFS (DOS1)
*OFS International (DOS2)
*FFS International (DOS3)
*OFS Directory Caching (DOS4)
*FFS Directory Caching (DOS5)

Fast File System 2 (AmigaOS4.x/MorphOS)
* OFS Long filenames (DOS6)
* FFS Long filenames (DOS7)

Both DOS6 and DOS7 feature International filenames featured in DOS2 and DO3, but not Directory Caching, which was abandoned due to bugs in the original implementation. DOS4 and DOS5 are not recommended for use for this reason.

Dostypes are backwards compatible with each other, but not forward compatible. A DOS7 formatted disk cannot be read on original Amiga FFS, and a DOS3 disk cannot be read on a KS1.3 Amiga. However, any disk formatted with DOS0 using FFS or FFS2 can be read by any version of the Amiga operating system. For this reason, DOS0 tended to be the format of choice of software developers distributing on floppy, except where a custom filesystem and bootblock was used - a common practice in Amiga games. Where software needed AmigaOS 2 anyway, DOS3 was generally used.

=== FastFileSystem2 plug-ins ===
With the July 2007 Update of AmigaOS 4.0 in 2007, the first two plug-ins for FFS2 were released:
* fs_plugin_cache: increases performance of FFS2 by introducing a new method of data buffering.
* fs_plugin_encrypt: data encryption plug-in for partitions using the Blowfish algorithm.

==Filename extensions==
AmigaDOS has only a single mandated filename extension: &quot;.info&quot;, which must be appended to the filename of each icon. If a file called myprog exists, then its icon file must be called myprog.info. In addition to image data, the icon file also records program metadata such as options and keywords, its own position on the desktop (AmigaOS can &quot;snapshot&quot; icons in places defined by the user), and other information about the file. Directory window size and position information is stored in the &quot;.info&quot; file associated with the directory, and disk icon information is stored in &quot;Disk.info&quot; in the root of the volume.

With the exception of icons, the Amiga system does not identify file types using extensions, but instead will examine either the icon associated with a file or the binary header of the file itself to determine the file type.

<doc id="88833" wikidata="Q95068" url="?curid=88833" title="Olivia de Havilland">
<text>Dame Olivia Mary de Havilland (; July 1, 1916July 26, 2020) was a British and American actress. The major works of her cinematic career spanned from 1935 to 1988. She appeared in 49 feature films and was one of the leading actresses of her time. Before her death in 2020 at age 104, she was the oldest living and earliest surviving Academy Award winner and was widely considered as being the last surviving major star from the Golden Age of Hollywood cinema. Her younger sister, with whom she had a noted rivalry well documented in the media, was Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine.

De Havilland first came to prominence with Errol Flynn as a screen couple in adventure films such as &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935) and &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). One of her best-known roles is that of Melanie Hamilton in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), for which she received the first of her five Oscar nominations, the only one for Best Supporting Actress. De Havilland departed from ingénue roles in the 1940s and later distinguished herself for performances in &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; (1941), &quot;To Each His Own&quot; (1946), &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; (1948), and &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949), receiving four Best Actress nominations and winning for &quot;To Each His Own&quot; and &quot;The Heiress&quot;. She was also successful in work on stage and television. De Havilland lived in Paris from the 1950s and received honors such as the National Medal of the Arts, the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and the appointment to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the age of 101.

In addition to her film career, deHavilland continued her work in the theater, appearing three times on Broadway, in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1951), &quot;Candida&quot; (1952), and &quot;A Gift of Time&quot; (1962). She also worked in television, appearing in the successful miniseries &quot;&quot; (1979), and &quot;&quot; (1986) for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Television Movie or Series. During her film career, deHavilland collected two New York Film Critics Circle Awards, the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup. For her contributions to the motion picture industry, she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She and her sister remain the only siblings to have won major acting Academy Awards.

==Early life==
By birth, Olivia was a member of the de Havilland family, which belonged to landed gentry that originated from mainland Normandy. Her mother, Lilian Fontaine (née Ruse; 1886–1975), was educated at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and became a stage actress. Lilian also sang with the Master of the King&#x27;s Music, Sir Walter Parratt, and toured the United Kingdom with the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. Olivia&#x27;s father, Walter de Havilland (1872–1968), served as an English professor at the Imperial University in Tokyo City before becoming a patent attorney. Her paternal cousin was Sir Geoffrey deHavilland (1882–1965), an aircraft designer and founder of the de Havilland aircraft company.

Lilian and Walter met in Japan in 1913 and married the following year; the marriage was not a happy one, owing in part to Walter&#x27;s infidelities. Olivia Mary deHavilland was born on July 1, 1916. They moved into a large house in Tokyo City, where Lilian gave informal singing recitals. Olivia&#x27;s younger sister Joan (Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland)later known as actress Joan Fontainewas born 15 months later, on October 22, 1917. Both sisters became British subjects automatically by birthright.

In February 1919, Lilian persuaded her husband to take the family back to Britain for a climate better suited to their ailing daughters. They sailed aboard the SS &quot;Siberia Maru&quot; to San Francisco, where the family stopped to treat Olivia&#x27;s tonsillitis. After Joan developed pneumonia, Lilian decided to remain with her daughters in California, where they eventually settled in the village of Saratoga, south of San Francisco. Her father abandoned the family and returned to his Japanese housekeeper, who eventually became his second wife.

Olivia was raised to appreciate the arts, beginning with ballet lessons at the age of four and piano lessons a year later. She learned to read before she was six, and her mother, who occasionally taught drama, music, and elocution, had her recite passages from Shakespeare to strengthen her diction. During this period, her younger sister Joan first started calling her &quot;Livvie&quot;, a nickname that would last throughout her life. DeHavilland entered Saratoga Grammar School in 1922 and did well in her studies. She enjoyed reading, writing poetry, and drawing, and once represented her grammar school in a county spelling bee, coming in second place. In 1923, Lilian had a new Tudor-style house built, where the family resided until the early 1930s. In April 1925, after her divorce was finalized, Lilian married George Milan Fontaine, a department store manager for O.A.Hale &amp; Co. in San Jose. Fontaine was a good provider and respectable businessman, but his strict parenting style generated animosity and later rebellion in both of his new stepdaughters.

DeHavilland continued her education at Los Gatos High School near her home in Saratoga. There she excelled in oratory and field hockey and participated in school plays and the school drama club, eventually becoming the club&#x27;s secretary. With plans of becoming a schoolteacher of English and speech, she also attended Notre Dame Convent in Belmont.

In 1933, a teenage deHavilland made her debut in amateur theater in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, a production of the Saratoga Community Players based on the novel by Lewis Carroll. She also appeared in several school plays, including &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; and &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;. Her passion for drama eventually led to a confrontation with her stepfather, who forbade her from participating in further extracurricular activities. When he learned that she had won the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet in a school fund-raising production of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, he told her that she had to choose between staying at home or appearing in the production and not being allowed home. Not wanting to let her school and classmates down, she left home, moving in with a family friend.

After graduating from high school in 1934, deHavilland was offered a scholarship to Mills College in Oakland to pursue her chosen career as an English teacher. She was also offered the role of Puck in the Saratoga Community Theater production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. That summer, Austrian director Max Reinhardt came to California for a major new production of the same play to premiere at the Hollywood Bowl. After one of Reinhardt&#x27;s assistants saw her perform in Saratoga, he offered her the second understudy position for the role of Hermia. One week before the premiere, the understudy Jean Rouverol and lead actress Gloria Stuart both left the project, leaving 18-year-old deHavilland to play Hermia. Impressed with her performance, Reinhardt offered her the part in the four-week autumn tour that followed. During that tour, Reinhardt received word that he would direct the Warner Bros. film version of his stage production, and he offered her the film role of Hermia. With her mind still set on becoming a teacher, deHavilland initially wavered, but eventually, Reinhardt and executive producer Henry Blanke persuaded her to sign a five-year contract with Warner Bros. on November 12, 1934, with a starting salary of $200 a week, marking the beginning of a professional acting career which would span more than 50 years.

==Career==
=== 1935–1937: Early films ===
DeHavilland made her screen debut in Reinhardt&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935), which was filmed at Warner Brothers
studios from December 19, 1934, to March 9, 1935. During the production, deHavilland picked up film acting techniques from the film&#x27;s co-director William Dieterle and camera techniques from cinematographer Hal Mohr, who was impressed with her questions about his work. By the end of filming, she had learned the effect of lighting and camera angles on how she appeared on screen and how to find her best lighting. Following premieres in New York City and Beverly Hills, the film was released on October 30, 1935. Despite the publicity campaign, the film generated little enthusiasm with audiences. While the critical response was mixed, deHavilland&#x27;s performance was praised by &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; critic. In his review in the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;, Winston Burdett wrote that she &quot;acts graciously and does greater justice to Shakespeare&#x27;s language than anyone else in the cast&quot;. Two minor comedies followed, &quot;Alibi Ike&quot; (1935) with Joe E. Brown and &quot;The Irish in Us&quot; (1935) with James Cagney. In both films, she played the sweet and charming love interesta role into which she would later become typecast. After the experience of being a Reinhardt player, deHavilland felt disappointed being assigned these routine heroine roles. In March, deHavilland and her mother moved into an apartment at the Chateau des Fleurs at 6626 Franklin Avenue in Hollywood.
Although Warner Brothers studio had assumed that the many costumed films that studios such as MGM had earlier produced would never succeed during the years of the American Great Depression, they nonetheless took a chance by producing &quot;Captain Blood&quot; (1935). The film is a swashbuckler action drama based on the novel by Rafael Sabatini and directed by Michael Curtiz. &quot;Captain Blood&quot; starred a then little-known contract bit-part actor and former extra, Errol Flynn, with the equally little-known de Havilland. According to film historian Tony Thomas, both actors had &quot;classic good looks, cultured speaking voices, and a sense of distant aristocracy about them&quot;. Filmed between August 5 and October 29, 1935, &quot;Captain Blood&quot; gave deHavilland the opportunity to appear in her first costumed historical romance and adventure epic, a genre to which she was well suited, given her beauty and elegance. 

In the film, she played Arabella Bishop, the niece of a Jamaica plantation owner who purchases at auction an Irish physician wrongly condemned to servitude. The on-screen chemistry between deHavilland and Flynn was evident from their first scenes together, where clashes between her character&#x27;s spirited hauteur and his character&#x27;s playful braggadocio did not mask their mutual attraction to each other. Arabella is a feisty young woman who knows what she wants and is willing to fight for it. The bantering tone of their exchanges in the filmthe healthy give-and-take and mutual respectbecame the basis for their on-screen relationship in subsequent films. &quot;Captain Blood&quot; was released on December 28, 1935, and received good reviews and wide public appeal. DeHavilland&#x27;s performance was singled out in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The popular success of the film, as well as the critical response to the on-screen couple, led to seven additional collaborations: &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938), &quot;Four&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (1938), &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (1939, although de Havilland played a supporting role with Bette Davis as Flynn&#x27;s leading lady), &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; (1940), and &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; (1941).

DeHavilland appeared in Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s historical drama &quot;Anthony Adverse&quot; (1936) with Fredric March. Based on the popular novel by Hervey Allen, the film follows the adventures of an orphan raised by a Scottish merchant whose pursuit of fortune separates him from the innocent peasant girl he loves, marries, and eventually loses. DeHavilland played a peasant girl, Angela, who after being separated from her slave-trader husband becomes opera star Mademoiselle Georges, the mistress of Napoleon. The film earned six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. It garnered deHavilland good exposure and the opportunity to portray a character as she develops over time. Howard Barnes of the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; found her later scenes as Mademoiselle Georges &quot;not very credible&quot;, but Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;a winsome Angela&quot;. That same year, she was re-united with Flynn in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s period action film &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1936), featuring Flynn look-alike Patric Knowles (playing Flynn&#x27;s brother) and David Niven. The picture was set during the Crimean War and became a major box office hit.

During the film&#x27;s production, deHavilland renegotiated her contract with Warner Bros. and signed a seven-year contract on April 14, 1936, with a starting weekly salary of $500 (). Toward the end of the year, 20-year-old deHavilland and her mother moved to 2337 Nella Vista Avenue in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles.
DeHavilland had her first top billing in Archie Mayo&#x27;s comedy &quot;Call It a Day&quot; (1937), about a middle-class English family struggling with the romantic effects of spring fever during the course of a single day. DeHavilland played daughter Catherine Hilton, who falls in love with the handsome artist hired to paint her portrait. The film did not do well at the box office and did little to advance her career. She fared better in Mayo&#x27;s screwball comedy &quot;It&#x27;s Love I&#x27;m After&quot; (1937) with Leslie Howard and Bette Davis. DeHavilland played Marcia West, a debutante and theater fan enamored with a Barrymore-like matinee idol who decides to help the girl&#x27;s fiancé by pretending to be an abominable cad. The film received good reviews, with &quot;Variety&quot; calling it &quot;fresh, clever, excellently directed and produced, and acted by an ensemble that clicks from start to finish&quot; and praising deHavilland.

Also released during 1937 was another period film with deHavilland, beginning with &quot;The Great Garrick&quot;, a fictional romantic comedy about the 18th-century English actor&#x27;s encounter with jealous players from the Comédie-Française who plot to embarrass him on his way to Paris. Wise to their prank, Garrick plays along with the ruse, determined to get the last laugh, even on a lovely young aristocrat, deHavilland&#x27;s Germaine Dupont, whom he mistakenly believes to be one of the players. With her refined demeanour and diction, deHavilland delivers a performance that is &quot;lighthearted and thoroughly believable&quot;, according to Judith Kass. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the film, calling it &quot;a production of superlative workmanship&quot;. Despite the positive reviews, the film did not do as well at the box office. The Michael Curtiz-directed romantic drama &quot;Gold Is Where You Find It&quot; is a film about the late 19th-century conflict in the Sacramento Valley between gold miners and their hydraulic equipment and farmers whose land is being flooded. DeHavilland played the daughter of a farmer, Serena Ferris, who falls in love with the mining engineer responsible for the flooding portrayed by George Brent. The picture also stars Claude Rains. The film was released in February 1938, and was her first appearance in a Technicolor film but not her last. She would make three more Technicolor films within the next two years, two of which would arguably remain her most fondly remembered by audiences across the decades since their release.

=== 1938–1940: Movie stardom ===
In September 1937, deHavilland was selected by Warner Bros. studio head Jack L. Warner to play Maid Marian opposite Errol Flynn in &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; (1938). Principal photography for this Technicolor production took place between September 26, 1937, and January 14, 1938, including location work at Bidwell Park, Busch Gardens in Pasadena, and Lake Sherwood in California. Directed by William Keighley and Michael Curtiz, the film is about the legendary Saxon knight who opposes the corrupt and brutal Prince John and his Norman lords while good King Richard is away fighting in the Third Crusade. The king&#x27;s ward Maid Marian initially opposes Robin Hood, but she later supports him after learning his true intentions of helping his oppressed people. No mere bystander to events, Marian risks her life to save Robin by providing his men with a plan for his escape. As defined by deHavilland, Marian is both a beautiful fairy-tale heroine and a spirited, intelligent woman &quot;whose actions are governed by her mind as well as her heart&quot;, according to author Judith Kass. &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; was released on May 14, 1938, and was an immediate critical and commercial success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. It went on to become one of the most popular adventure films of the Classical Hollywood era.

The success of &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; raised deHavilland&#x27;s status, but this was not reflected in her subsequent film assignments at Warner Bros. Her next several roles were more routine and less challenging. In the romantic comedy &quot;Four&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (also 1938), she played Lorri Dillingwell, a flighty rich girl being romanced by a conniving public relations man looking to land an account with her eccentric grandfather. In Ray Enright&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Hard to Get&quot; (1938), she played another frivolous rich girl, Margaret Richards, whose desire to exact revenge on a gas station attendant leads to her own comeuppance. In the summer of 1938, she portrayed the love interest between two U.S. Navy pilot brothers in &quot;Wings of the Navy&quot;, released in early 1939. While deHavilland was certainly capable of playing these kinds of characters, her personality was better suited to stronger and more dramatic roles, according to Judith Kass. By this time, deHavilland had serious doubts about her career at Warner Bros.

Some film scholars consider 1939 to be the high point of the golden age of Classic Cinema, producing award-winning, box office hits in many genres, including the Western. Warner Bros. produced Michael Curtiz&#x27;s Technicolor adventure &quot;Dodge City&quot; (1939), Flynn and deHavilland&#x27;s first Western film. Set during the American Civil War, the film is about a Texas trailblazer who witnesses the brutal lawlessness of Dodge City, Kansas, and becomes sheriff to clean up the town. DeHavilland played Abbie Irving, whose initial hostility towards Flynn&#x27;s character Wade Hatton is transformed by events, and the two fall in loveby now a proven formula for their on-screen relationships. Curtiz&#x27;s action sequences, Sol Polito&#x27;s cinematography, Max Steiner&#x27;s expansive film score, and perhaps the &quot;definitive saloon brawl in movie history&quot; all contributed to the film&#x27;s success. &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as &quot;a lusty western, packed with action&quot;. For deHavilland, playing yet one more supporting love interest in a limited role, &quot;Dodge City&quot; represented the emotional low point of her career to that point. She later said, &quot;I was in such a depressed state that I could hardly remember my lines.&quot;
In a letter to a colleague dated November 18, 1938, film producer David O. Selznick wrote, &quot;I would give anything if we had Olivia deHavilland under contract to us so that we could cast her as Melanie.&quot; The film he was preparing to shoot was the Technicolor epic &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend her out for the project. DeHavilland had read the novel, and unlike most other actresses, who wanted the Scarlett O&#x27;Hara role, she wanted to play Melanie Hamiltona character whose quiet dignity and inner strength she understood and felt she could bring to life on the screen.

DeHavilland turned to Warner&#x27;s wife Anne for help. Warner later recalled: &quot;Olivia, who had a brain like a computer concealed behind those fawn-like eyes, simply went to my wife and they joined forces to change my mind.&quot; Warner relented, and deHavilland was signed to the project a few weeks before the start of principal photography on January 26, 1939. Set in the American South during the Civil War and Reconstruction eras, the film is about Scarlett O&#x27;Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner in love with the husband of her sister-in-law Melanie, whose kindness stands in sharp contrast to those around her. According to film historian Tony Thomas, deHavilland&#x27;s skillful and subtle performance effectively presents this character of selfless love and quiet strength in a way that keeps her vital and interesting throughout the film. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; had its world premiere in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 15, 1939, and was well received. Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that deHavilland&#x27;s Melanie &quot;is a gracious, dignified, tender gem of characterization&quot;, and John C. Flinn Sr. in &quot;Variety&quot; called her &quot;a standout&quot;. The film won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and deHavilland received her first nomination for Best Supporting Actress.
Within days of completing her work in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in June 1939, deHavilland returned to Warner Bros. and began filming Michael Curtiz&#x27;s historical drama &quot;The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex&quot; (also 1939) with Bette Davis and Errol Flynn. She had hoped her work on Selznick&#x27;s prestige picture would lead to first-rate roles at Warner Bros., but instead, she received third billing below the title as the queen&#x27;s lady-in-waiting. In early September, she was lent out to Samuel Goldwyn Productions for Sam Wood&#x27;s romantic caper film &quot;Raffles&quot; (also 1939) with David Niven, about a high-society cricketer and jewel thief. She later complained, &quot;I had nothing to do with that style of film.&quot;
In early 1940, deHavilland refused to appear in several films assigned to her, initiating the first of her suspensions at the studio. She did agree to play in Curtis Bernhardt&#x27;s musical comedy drama &quot;My Love Came Back&quot; (1940) with Jeffrey Lynn and Eddie Albert, who played a classical music student turned swing jazz bandleader. DeHavilland played violinist Amelia Cornell, whose life becomes complicated by the support of a wealthy sponsor. In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther described the film as &quot;a featherlight frolic, a rollicking roundelay of deliciously pointed nonsense&quot;, finding that deHavilland &quot;plays the part with pace and wit&quot;.

That same year, deHavilland was re-united with Flynn in their sixth film together, Michael Curtiz&#x27;s Western adventure &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;, set against the backdrop of abolitionist John Brown&#x27;s radical anti-slavery attacks in the days leading up to the American Civil War. The mostly fictional story follows West Point cadets J. E. B. Stuart, played by Flynn, and George Armstrong Custer, played by Ronald Reagan, as they make their way west, both vying for the affection of deHavilland&#x27;s Kit Carson Halliday. Playing Kit in a provocative, tongue-in-cheek manner, deHavilland creates a character of real substance and dimension, according to Tony Thomas. Following a world premiere on December 13, 1940, at the Lensic Theater in Santa Fe, New Mexicoattended by cast members, reporters, the governor, and over 60,000 fans &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot; became one of the top-grossing films of 1940. DeHavilland, who accompanied Flynn on the well-publicized train ride to Santa Fe, did not attend the premiere, having been diagnosed with appendicitis that morning and rushed into surgery.

=== 1941–1944: War years and lawsuit ===
Following her emergency surgery, deHavilland began a long period of convalescence in a Los Angeles hospital during which time she rejected several scripts offered to her by Warner Bros., leading to another suspension. She appeared in three commercially successful films released in 1941, beginning with Raoul Walsh&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; with James Cagney. Set during the Gay Nineties, the story involves a man who marries an outspoken advocate for women&#x27;s rights after a rival steals his glamorous &quot;strawberry blonde&quot; girlfriend, and later discovers he ended up with a loving and understanding wife. The film was a critical and commercial success. In Mitch Leisen&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; with Charles Boyer for Paramount Pictures, she transitioned to a different type of role for heran ordinary, decent small-town teacher whose life and sexuality are awakened by a sophisticated European gigolo, whose own life is positively affected by her love. Leisen&#x27;s careful direction and guidance appealed to deHavillandmuch more than the workman-like approach of her Warner Bros. directors. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the actress &quot;plays the school teacher as a woman with romantic fancies whose honesty and pride are her ownand the film&#x27;schief support. Incidentally, she is excellent.&quot; For this performance, she garnered her second Academy Award nominationthis time for Best Actress.

DeHavilland was re-united with Flynn for their eighth movie together, Raoul Walsh&#x27;s epic &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot;. The film is loosely based on the courtship and marriage of George Armstrong Custer and Elizabeth &quot;Libbie&quot; Bacon. Flynn and deHavilland had a falling out the previous yearmainly over the roles she was being givenand she did not intend to work with him again. Flynn said, &quot;She was sick to death of playing &#x27;the girl&#x27; and badly wanted a few good roles to show herself and the world that she was a fine actress.&quot; After she learned from Warner that Flynn had come to his office saying he needed her in the film, deHavilland accepted. Screenwriter Lenore Coffee was brought in to add several romantic scenes and improve the overall dialogue. The result is a film that includes some of their finest work together. Their last appearance on screen is Custer&#x27;s farewell to his wife. &quot;Errol was quite sensitive&quot;, deHavilland would later remember, &quot;I think he knew it would be the last time we worked together.&quot; Flynn&#x27;s final line in that scene would hold special meaning for her: &quot;Walking through life with you, ma&#x27;am, has been a very gracious thing.&quot; &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; was released on November 21, 1941, and while some reviewers criticized the film&#x27;s historical inaccuracies, most applauded the action sequences, cinematography, and acting. Thomas M. Pryor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found deHavilland &quot;altogether captivating&quot;. The film went on to earn $2,550,000 (), Warner Bros&#x27; second-biggest money-maker of that year.

DeHavilland appeared in Elliott Nugent&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Male Animal&quot; (1942) with Henry Fonda, about an idealistic professor fighting for academic freedom while trying to hold onto his job and his wife Ellen, portrayed by de Havilland. While her role was not particularly challenging, deHavilland&#x27;s delineation of an intelligent, good-natured woman trying to resolve the unsettling circumstances of her life played a major part in the film&#x27;s success, according to Tony Thomas. The film was a critical and commercial success, with Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noting that deHavilland &quot;concocts a delightfully pliant and saucy character as the wife&quot;. Around the same time, she appeared in John Huston&#x27;s drama &quot;In This Our Life&quot; (also 1942) with Bette Davis. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Ellen Glasgow, the story is about two sisters whose lives are destroyed by the anger and jealousy of one of the sisters. Crowther gave the film a negative review, but praised deHavilland&#x27;s &quot;warm and easy performance&quot;. During production, deHavilland and Huston began a romantic relationship that lasted three years.

According to deHavilland, one of the few truly satisfying roles she played for Warner Bros. was the title character in Norman Krasna&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Princess O&#x27;Rourke&quot; (1943), with Robert Cummings. Filmed in July and August 1942, the story is about a European princess in New York City visiting her diplomat uncle, who is trying to find her an American husband. Intent on marrying a man of her own choosing, she boards a plane heading west and ends up falling in love with an American pilot, who is unaware of her true identity. The film was released on October 23, 1943, and did well at the box office. Bosley Crowther called it &quot;a film which is in the best tradition of American screen comedy&quot;, and found deHavilland&#x27;s performance &quot;charming&quot;.
After fulfilling her seven-year Warner Bros. contract in 1943, deHavilland was informed that six months had been added to her contract for the times that she had been suspended. At the time, the studios had adopted the position that California law allowed them to suspend contract players for rejecting a role, and the period of suspension could be added to the contract period. Most contract players accepted this, but a few tried to challenge this assumption, including Bette Davis, who mounted an unsuccessful lawsuit against Warner Bros. in the 1930s. On August 23, 1943, acting on the advice of her lawyer Martin Gang, deHavilland filed suit against Warner Bros. in Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking declaratory judgment that she was no longer bound by her contract on the grounds that an existing section of the California Labor Code forbade an employer from enforcing a contract against an employee for longer than seven years from the date of first performance. In November 1943, the court found in deHavilland&#x27;s favor, and Warner Bros. immediately appealed.

A little over a year later, the California Court of Appeal for the Second District ruled in her favor. The decision was one of the most significant and far-reaching legal rulings in Hollywood, reducing the power of the studios and extending greater creative freedom to performers. California&#x27;s resulting &quot;seven-year rule&quot;, as articulated by the Court of Appeal in analysing Labor Code Section 2855 in the De Havilland case, is still known as the De Havilland Law. Her legal victory, which cost her $13,000 () in legal fees, won deHavilland the respect and admiration of her peers, among them her own sister Joan Fontaine, who later commented, &quot;Hollywood owes Olivia a great deal.&quot; Warner Bros. reacted to deHavilland&#x27;s lawsuit by circulating a letter to other studios that had the effect of a &quot;virtual blacklisting.&quot; As a consequence, deHavilland did not work at a film studio for nearly two years.
DeHavilland became a naturalized citizen of the United States on November 28, 1941, 10 days before the United States entered World War II militarily. During the war years, she actively contributed to the war effort. In May 1942, she joined the Hollywood Victory Caravan, a three-week train tour of the country that raised money through the sale of war bonds. Later that year, she began attending events at the Hollywood Canteen, meeting and dancing with troops. In December 1943, deHavilland joined a USO tour that travelled throughout the United States and the South Pacific, visiting wounded soldiers in military hospitals. She earned the respect and admiration of the troops for visiting the isolated islands and battlefronts in the Pacific. She survived flights in damaged aircraft and a bout with viral pneumonia requiring several days&#x27; stay in one of the island barrack hospitals. She later remembered, &quot;I loved doing the tours because it was a way I could serve my country and contribute to the war effort.&quot;

=== 1945–1952: Vindication and recognition ===

After the California Court of Appeal ruling freed her from her Warner Bros. contract, deHavilland signed a two-picture deal with Paramount Pictures. In June 1945, she began filming Mitchell Leisen&#x27;s drama &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, (1946) about an unwed mother who gives up her child for adoption and then spends the rest of her life trying to undo that decision. DeHavilland insisted on bringing in Leisen as director, trusting his eye for detail, his empathy for actors, and the way he controlled sentiment in their previous collaboration, &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot;. The role required deHavilland to age nearly 30 years over the course of the filmfrom an innocent, small-town girl to a shrewd, ruthless businesswoman devoted to her cosmetics company. While deHavilland never formally studied acting, she did read Stanislavsky&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Life in Art&quot; and applied one of his &quot;methods&quot; for this role. To help her define her character during the four periods of the story, she used a different perfume for each period. She also lowered the pitch of her voice incrementally in each period until it became a mature woman&#x27;s voice. Her performance earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress for 1946her first Oscar. According to film historian Tony Thomas, the award represented a vindication of her long struggle with Warner Bros. and confirmation of her abilities as an actress.

Her next two roles were challenging. In Robert Siodmak&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;The Dark Mirror&quot; (also 1946), deHavilland played twin sisters Ruth and Terry Collinsone loving and normal, the other psychotic. In addition to the technical problems of showing her as two characters interacting with each other on screen at the same time, deHavilland needed to portray two separate and psychologically opposite people. While the film was not well received by critics&quot;Variety&quot; said the film &quot;gets lost in a maze of psychological gadgets and speculation&quot;deHavilland&#x27;s performance was praised by Tony Thomas, who called her final scene in the film &quot;an almost frighteningly convincing piece of acting&quot;. In his review in &quot;The Nation&quot;, James Agee wrote that &quot;her playing is thoughtful, quiet, detailed, and well sustained, and since it is founded, as some more talented playing is not, in an unusually healthful-seeming and likable temperament, it is an undivided pleasure to see&quot;. Later that year while appearing in a summer stock production of &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot; in Westport, Connecticut, her second professional stage appearance, deHavilland began dating Marcus Goodrich, a U.S. Navy veteran, journalist, and author of the novel &quot;Delilah&quot; (1941). The couple married on August 26, 1946.

De Havilland was praised for her performance as Virginia Cunningham in Anatole Litvak&#x27;s drama &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; (1948), one of the first films to attempt a realistic portrayal of mental illness and an important exposé of the harsh conditions in state mental hospitals, according to film critic Philip French. Based on a novel by Mary Jane Ward and produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, the film is about a woman placed in a mental institution by her husband to help her recover from a nervous breakdown. Virginia Cunningham was one of the most difficult of all her film roles, requiring significant preparation both mentally and physicallyshe deliberately lost weight to help create her gaunt appearance on screen. She consulted regularly with psychiatrists hired as consultants for the film, and visited Camarillo State Mental Hospital to research her role and observe the patients. The extreme physical discomfort of the hydrotherapy and simulated electric shock therapy scenes were especially challenging for the slight actress. In her performance, she conveyed her mental anguish by physically transforming her face with furrowed brow, wild staring eyes, and grimacing mouth.
According to author Judith Kass, deHavilland delivered a performance both &quot;restrained and electric&quot;, portraying varied and extreme aspects of her characterfrom a shy young woman to a tormented and disorientated woman. For her performance in &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, deHavilland received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup.

DeHavilland appeared in William Wyler&#x27;s period drama &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949), the fourth in a string of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland&#x27;s help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel &quot;Washington Square&quot; by Henry James, the film is about a naïve young woman who falls in love with a young man (Montgomery Clift), over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot;, deHavilland portrayed her character&#x27;s transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is too shy to verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine&#x27;s trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. &quot;The Heiress&quot; was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.

After giving birth to her first child, Benjamin, on September 27, 1949, deHavilland took time off from making films to be with her infant son. She turned down the role of Blanche DuBois in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, later explaining that becoming a mother was a &quot;transforming experience&quot; and that she could not relate to the character. In 1950, her family moved to New York City, where she began rehearsals for a major new stage production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;; it was her life-long ambition to play Juliet on the stage. The play opened at the Broadhurst Theater on March 11, 1951, to mixed reviews, with some critics believing the 35-year-old actress was too old for the role. The play closed after 45 performances. Undaunted, deHavilland accepted the title role in the stage production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s comedy &quot;Candida&quot;, which opened at the National Theater on Broadway in April 1952. While reviews of the play were mixed, deHavilland&#x27;s performance was well received, and following the scheduled 32 performances, she went on tour with the company and delivered 323 additional performances, many to sold-out audiences. While deHavilland achieved major accomplishments during this period of her career, her marriage to Goodrich, 18 years her senior, had grown strained because of his unstable temperament. In August 1952, she filed for divorce, which became final the following year.

=== 1953–1962: New life in Paris ===
In April 1953, at the invitation of the French government, she travelled to the Cannes Film Festival, where she met Pierre Galante, an executive editor for the French journal &quot;Paris Match&quot;. Following a long-distance courtship and the requisite nine-month residency requirement, deHavilland and Galante married on April 12, 1955, in the village of Yvoy-le-Marron, and settled together in a three-storey house near the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris&#x27; 16th &quot;Arrondissement&quot;. That same year, she returned to the screen in Terence Young&#x27;s period drama &quot;That Lady&quot; (1955), about a Spanish princess and her unrequited love for King Philip II of Spain, whose respect she earned in her youth after losing an eye in a sword fight defending his honor. According to Tony Thomas, the film uses authentic Spanish locations effectively, but suffers from a convoluted plot and excessive dialogue, and while deHavilland delivered a warm and elegant performance as Ana de Mendoza, the film was disappointing. Following her appearances in the romantic melodrama &quot;Not as a Stranger&quot; (1955) and &quot;The Ambassador&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1956)neither of which were successful at the box officedeHavilland gave birth to her second child, Gisèle Galante, on July 18, 1956.
De Havilland returned to the screen in Michael Curtiz&#x27;s Western drama &quot;The Proud Rebel&quot; (1958), a film about a former Confederate soldier (Alan Ladd) whose wife was killed in the war and whose son lost the ability to speak after witnessing the tragedy. DeHavilland played Linnett Moore, a tough yet feminine frontier woman who cares for the boy and comes to love his father. The movie was filmed on location in Utah, where deHavilland learned to hitch and drive a team of horses and handle a gun for her role. &quot;The Proud Rebel&quot; was released May 28, 1958, and was well received by audiences and critics. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. H. Weiler called the film a &quot;truly sensitive effort&quot; and &quot;heartwarming drama&quot;, and praised deHavilland&#x27;s ability to convey the &quot;warmth, affection and sturdiness needed in the role&quot;.

One of deHavilland&#x27;s best received performances during this period was in Guy Green&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot; (1962) with Rossano Brazzi. Filmed in Florence and Rome, and based on Elizabeth Spencer&#x27;s novel of the same name, the film is about a middle-class American tourist on extended vacation in Italy with her beautiful 26-year-old daughter (Yvette Mimieux), who is mentally disabled as a result of a childhood accident. Faced with the prospect of her daughter falling in love with a young Italian, the mother struggles with conflicting emotions about her daughter&#x27;s future. DeHavilland projects a calm maternal serenity throughout most of the film, only showing glimpses of the worried mother anxious for her child&#x27;s happiness. The film was released on February 19, 1962, and was well received, with a &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; reviewer calling it &quot;an uncommon love story ... told with rare delicacy and force&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; noting that the film &quot;achieves the rare and delicate balance of artistic beauty, romantic substance, dramatic novelty and commercial appeal&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; singled out deHavilland&#x27;s performance as &quot;one of great consistency and subtle projection&quot;.

In early 1962, deHavilland traveled to New York City, and began rehearsals for Garson Kanin&#x27;s stage play &quot;A Gift of Time&quot;. Adapted from the autobiographical book &quot;Death of a Man&quot; by Lael Tucker Wertenbaker, the play explores the emotionally painful struggle of a housewife forced to deal with the slow death of her husband, played by Henry Fonda. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater on Broadway to positive notices, with deHavilland receiving her best reviews as a stage actress. Theater critic Walter Kerr praised her final scene, writing, &quot;As darkness gathers, the actress gains in stature, taking on the simple and resolute willingness to understand.&quot; The &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot; reviewer concluded: &quot;It is Miss deHavilland who gives the play its unbroken continuity. This distinguished actress reveals Lael as a special and admirable woman.&quot; She stayed with the production for 90 performances. The year 1962 also saw the publication of deHavilland&#x27;s first book, &quot;Every Frenchman Has One&quot;, a lighthearted account of her often amusing attempts to understand and adapt to French life, manners, and customs. The book sold out its first printing prior to the publication date and went on to become a bestseller.

=== 1963–1988: Later films and television ===

De Havilland appeared in her final motion picture leading roles in two films released in 1964, both of which were psychological thrillers. In Walter Grauman&#x27;s &quot;Lady in a Cage&quot;, she played a wealthy poet who becomes trapped in her mansion&#x27;s elevator and faces the threat of three terrorising hooligans in her own home. Critics responded negatively to the graphic violence and cruelty shown on screen. A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;sordid, if suspenseful, exercise in aimless brutality&quot;. That same year, deHavilland appeared in Robert Aldrich&#x27;s &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; with her close friend Bette Davis. After Joan Crawford left the picture owing to illness, Davis had Aldrich fly to Switzerland to persuade a reluctant deHavilland to accept the role of Miriam Deering, a cruel, conniving character hidden behind the charming façade of a polite and cultured lady. Her quiet, restrained performance provided a counterbalance to Davis. Film historian Tony Thomas described her performance as &quot;a subtle piece of acting&quot; that was &quot;a vital contribution to the effectiveness of the film&quot;. The film was mainly well received and earned seven Academy Award nominations. In 1965 she served as the president of the jury of the 18th Cannes Film Festival, the first woman to do so.

As film roles became more difficult to find, a common problem shared by many Hollywood veterans from her era, deHavilland began working in television dramas, despite her dislike of the networks&#x27; practice of breaking up story lines with commercials. Her first venture into the medium was a teleplay directed by Sam Peckinpah called &quot;Noon Wine&quot; (1966) on &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, a dark tragedy about a farmer&#x27;s act of murder that leads to his suicide. The production and her performance as the farmer&#x27;s wife Ellie were well received. In 1972, she starred in her first television film, &quot;The Screaming Woman&quot;, about a wealthy woman recovering from a nervous breakdown. In 1979, she appeared in the ABC miniseries &quot;&quot; in the role of Mrs. Warner, the wife of a former Confederate officer played by Henry Fonda. The miniseries was seen by an estimated 110million peoplenearly one-third of American homes with television sets. Throughout the 1970s, deHavilland&#x27;s film work was limited to smaller supporting roles and cameo appearances. Her last feature film was &quot;The Fifth Musketeer&quot; (1979). During this period, deHavilland began doing speaking engagements in cities across the United States with a talk entitled &quot;From the City of the Stars to the City of Light&quot;, a programme of personal reminiscences about her life and career. She also attended tributes to &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.

In the 1980s, her television work included an Agatha Christie television film &quot;Murder Is Easy&quot; (1982), the television drama &quot;The Royal Romance of Charles and Diana&quot; (1982) in which she played the Queen Mother, and the 1986 ABC miniseries &quot;North and South, Book II&quot;. Her performance in the television film &quot;&quot; (1986), as Dowager Empress Maria, earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film. In 1988, deHavilland appeared in the HTV romantic television drama &quot;The Woman He Loved&quot;; it was her final screen performance.

=== 1989–2020: Retirement and honors ===

In retirement, deHavilland remained active in the film community. In 1998, she travelled to New York City to help promote a special showing of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In 2003, she appeared as a presenter at the 75th Academy Awards, earning an extended standing ovation upon her entrance. In 2004, Turner Classic Movies produced a retrospective piece called &quot;Melanie Remembers&quot; in which she was interviewed for the 65th anniversary of the original release of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In June 2006, she made appearances at tributes commemorating her 90th birthday at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

On November 17, 2008, at the age of 92, deHavilland received the National Medal of Arts, the highest honor conferred to an individual artist on behalf of the people of the United States. The medal was presented to her by President George W. Bush, who commended her &quot;for her persuasive and compelling skill as an actress in roles from Shakespeare&#x27;s Hermia to Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s Melanie. Her independence, integrity, and grace won creative freedom for herself and her fellow film actors.&quot; The following year, deHavilland narrated the documentary &quot;I Remember Better When I Paint&quot; (2009), a film about the importance of art in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

In 2010, de Havilland almost made her return to the big screen after a 22-year hiatus with James Ivory&#x27;s planned adaptation of &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot;, but the film was never made. On September 9, 2010, deHavilland was appointed a &quot;Chevalier&quot; (knight) of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, the highest decoration in France, awarded by President Nicolas Sarkozy, who told the actress, &quot;You honor France for having chosen us.&quot; In February the following year, she appeared at the César Awards in France, where she was greeted with a standing ovation. DeHavilland celebrated her 100th birthday on July 1, 2016.

In June 2017, two weeks before her 101st birthday, de Havilland was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to drama by Queen Elizabeth II. She is the oldest woman ever to receive the honor. In a statement, she called it &quot;the most gratifying of birthday presents&quot;. She did not travel to the investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace and received her honor from the hands of the British Ambassador to France at her Paris apartment in March 2018, four months before her 102nd birthday. Her daughter Gisèle was by her side.

==Personal life==
===Relationships===
Although known as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most exciting on-screen couples, deHavilland and Errol Flynn were never involved in a romantic relationship. Upon first meeting her at Warner Bros. in August 1935, 26-year-old Flynn was drawn to the 19-year-old actress with &quot;warm brown eyes&quot; and &quot;extraordinary charm&quot;. In turn, deHavilland fell in love with him, but kept her feelings to herself. Flynn later wrote, &quot;By the time we made &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, I was sure that I was in love with her.&quot; Flynn finally professed his love on March 12, 1937, at the coronation ball for King George VI at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, where they slow danced together to &quot;Sweet Leilani&quot; at the hotel&#x27;s Coconut Grove nightclub. &quot;I was deeply affected by him,&quot; she later remembered, &quot;It was impossible for me not to be.&quot; The evening ended on a sobering note, however, with deHavilland insisting that despite his separation from his wife Lili Damita, he needed to divorce her before their relationship could proceed. Flynn re-united with his wife later that year, and deHavilland never acted on her feelings for Flynn.

In July 1938, deHavilland began dating business tycoon, aviator, and filmmaker Howard Hughes, who had just completed his record-setting flight around the world in 91 hours. In addition to escorting her about town, he gave the actress her first flying lessons. She later said, &quot;He was a rather shy man ... and yet, in a whole community where the men every day played heroes on the screen and didn&#x27;t do anything heroic in life, here was this man who was a real hero.&quot;

In December 1939, she began a romantic relationship with actor James Stewart. At the request of Irene Mayer Selznick, the actor&#x27;s agent asked Stewart to escort deHavilland to the New York premiere of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; at the Astor Theater on December 19, 1939. Over the next few days, Stewart took her to the theater several times and to the 21 Club. They continued to see each other back in Los Angeles, where Stewart provided occasional flying lessons and romance. According to deHavilland, Stewart proposed marriage to her in 1940, but she felt that he was not ready to settle down. Their relationship ended in late 1941 when deHavilland began a romantic relationship with film director John Huston while making &quot;In This Our Life&quot;. &quot;John was a very great love of mine&quot;, she later said, &quot;He was a man I wanted to marry.&quot;

===Marriages and children===

On August 26, 1946, she married Marcus Goodrich, a U.S. Navy veteran, journalist, and author of the novel &quot;Delilah&quot; (1941). The marriage ended in divorce in 1953. They had one child, Benjamin Goodrich, who was born on September 27, 1949. Benjamin was diagnosed with Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma at the age of 19 and graduated from the University of Texas. He worked as a statistical analyst for Lockheed Missiles and Space Company in Sunnyvale, California, and as an international banking representative for the Texas Commerce Bank in Houston. He died on September 29, 1991, in Paris at the age of 42 of heart disease brought on by treatments for Hodgkin&#x27;s disease, three weeks before the death of his father.

On April 2, 1955, deHavilland married Pierre Galante, an executive editor for the magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot;. Her marriage to Galante prompted her relocation to Paris. The couple separated in 1962, but continued to live in the same house for another six years to raise their daughter together. Galante moved across the street and the two remained close, even after the divorce was finalized in 1979. She looked after him during his final bout with lung cancer prior to his death in 1998. They had one child, Gisèle Galante, who was born on July 18, 1956. After studying law at the Paris Nanterre University School of Law, she worked as a journalist in France and the United States. From 1956, deHavilland lived in a three-storey house near the Bois de Boulogne in Paris.

===Religion and politics===
DeHavilland was raised in the Episcopal Church and remained an Episcopalian throughout her life. In the 1970s, she became one of the first women lectors at the American Cathedral in Paris, where she was on the regular rota for Scripture readings. As recently as 2012, she was doing readings on major feast days, including Christmas and Easter. &quot;It&#x27;s a task I love&quot;, she once said. In describing her preparation for her readings, she once observed, &quot;You have to convey the deep meaning, you see, and it has to start with your own faith. But first, I always pray. I pray before I start to prepare, as well. In fact, I would always say a prayer before shooting a scene, so this is not so different, in a way.&quot; DeHavilland preferred to use the Revised English Bible for its poetic style. She raised her son, Benjamin, in the Episcopal Church and her daughter, Gisèle, in the Roman Catholic Church, the faith of each child&#x27;s father.

As a United States citizen, deHavilland became involved in politics as a way of exercising her civic responsibilities. She campaigned for Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s ultimately successful reelection bid in 1944. After the war, she joined the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions, a national public-policy advocacy group that included Bette Davis, Gregory Peck, Groucho Marx, and Humphrey Bogart in its Hollywood chapter. In June 1946, she was asked to deliver speeches for the committee that reflected the Communist Party line, and the group was later alleged to be a communist front organization. Disturbed at seeing a small group of communist members manipulating the committee, she removed the pro-communist material from her speeches and rewrote them to reflect Democratic president Harry S. Truman&#x27;s anti-communist platform. She later recalled, &quot;I realized a nucleus of people was controlling the organization without a majority of the members of the board being aware of it. And I knew they had to be Communists.&quot;

She organized a fight to regain control of the committee from its pro-Soviet leadership, but her reform efforts failed. Her resignation from the committee triggered a wave of resignations by 11 other Hollywood figures, including future president Ronald Reagan. In 1958, she was secretly called before the House Un-American Activities Committee and recounted her experiences with the Independent Citizens&#x27; Committee.

===Relationship with Joan Fontaine===

De Havilland and her sister Joan Fontaine are the only siblings to have each won Academy Awards in a lead acting category. According to biographer Charles Higham, the sisters always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia had trouble accepting the idea of having a younger sister and Joan resented that her mother favored Olivia. Olivia would tear the clothes that her sister was given to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to stitch them together again. This tension was made worse by Fontaine&#x27;s frequent childhood illnesses, which led to her mother&#x27;s overly protective expression &quot;Livvie can, Joan can&#x27;t.&quot; DeHavilland was the first to become an actress, and for several years Fontaine was overshadowed by her sister&#x27;s accomplishments. When Mervyn LeRoy offered Fontaine a personal contract, her mother told her that Warner Bros. was &quot;Olivia&#x27;s studio&quot; and that she could not use the family name of deHavilland.

In 1942, deHavilland and Fontaine were both nominated for an Academy Award for Best ActressdeHavilland for &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; and Fontaine for &quot;Suspicion&quot;. When Fontaine&#x27;s name was announced as winner, deHavilland reacted graciously saying &quot;We&#x27;ve got it!&quot; According to biographer Charles Higham, Fontaine rejected deHavilland&#x27;s attempts to congratulate her, leaving deHavilland offended and embarrassed.

Their relationship was strained further in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland&#x27;s new husband Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister&#x27;s remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt and waited for an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for &quot;To Each His Own&quot;, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland turned away from her sister. The two did not speak for the next five years. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt.

Following her divorce from Goodrich, deHavilland resumed contact with her sister, visiting Fontaine&#x27;s New York apartment and spending Christmas together in 1961. The final break between the sisters occurred in 1975 over disagreements regarding their mother&#x27;s cancer treatment; deHavilland wanted to consult other doctors and supported exploratory surgery but Fontaine disagreed. Fontaine later claimed that deHavilland had not notified her of their mother&#x27;s death while she was touring with a play, but deHavilland had in fact sent a telegram, which took two weeks to reach her sister. However, according to Fontaine in a 1979 interview with the CBC, de Havilland did not bother to phone to find out where she could be reached. The sibling feud lasted until Fontaine&#x27;s death on December 15, 2013. The following day, deHavilland released a statement saying that she was &quot;shocked and saddened&quot; by the news.

=== Death ===
De Havilland died in her sleep of natural causes at her home in Paris on July 26, 2020, at the age of 104. Her funeral was held on August 1, 2020, at the American Cathedral in Paris. After cremation, her ashes were placed in the crematorium-columbarium of Père-Lachaise, in an urn later to be transferred to a family burial place on the British island of Guernsey.

==Legacy==

De Havilland began her acting career playing demure ingénues opposite male stars such as Errol Flynn, with whom she made her breakout film &quot;Captain Blood&quot; in 1935. Flynn and deHavilland made eight more feature films together and became one of Hollywood&#x27;s most successful on-screen romantic pairings. DeHavilland appeared in 49 feature films, and her range of performances included roles in most major movie genres. Following her film debut in the Shakespeare adaptation &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, she achieved her initial popularity in romantic comedies, such as &quot;The Great Garrick&quot; and &quot;Hard to Get&quot;, and Western adventure films, such as &quot;Dodge City&quot; and &quot;Santa Fe Trail&quot;. In her later career, she was most successful in drama films, such as &quot;In This Our Life&quot; and &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot;, and psychological dramas in which she played non-glamorous characters in films such as &quot;The Dark Mirror&quot;, &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, and &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot;.

During her career, deHavilland won two Academy Awards (&quot;To Each His Own&quot; and &quot;The Heiress&quot;), two Golden Globe Awards (&quot;The Heiress&quot; and &quot;Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna&quot;), two New York Film Critics Circle Awards (&quot;The Snake Pit&quot; and &quot;The Heiress&quot;), the National Board of Review Award and the Venice Film Festival Volpi Cup (&quot;The Snake Pit&quot;), and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination (&quot;Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna&quot;).

For her contributions to the motion picture industry, deHavilland received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Hertfordshire in 1998 and from Mills College in 2018. She was one of 500 stars nominated for the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of 50 greatest screen legends.
In 2006, she was inducted into the Online Film &amp; Television Association Award Film Hall of Fame.

The moving-image collection of Olivia de Havilland is held at the Academy Film Archive, which includes a preserved nitrate reel of a screen test for &quot;Danton&quot;, Max Reinhardt&#x27;s never-produced follow-up to &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1935).

As a confidante and friend of Bette Davis, deHavilland is featured in the series &quot;&quot;, where she is portrayed by Catherine Zeta-Jones. In the series, deHavilland reflects on the origins and depth of the Davis–Crawford feud and how it affected contemporary female Hollywood stars. In 2017, she filed suit against FX Networks and producer Ryan Murphy for inaccurately portraying her and using her likeness without permission. Although FX attempted to strike the suit as a strategic lawsuit against public participation, Judge Holly Kendig denied the motion and set trial for November 2017. An interlocutory appeal of the ruling was argued in March 2018. A three-justice panel of the California Court of Appeal ruled that the trial court had erred in denying the defendants&#x27; motion to strike, in a published opinion by Justice Anne Egerton that affirmed the right of filmmakers to embellish the historical record and that such portrayals are protected by the First Amendment. De Havilland appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in September 2018, which declined to review the case.

She was portrayed by Ashlee Lollback in the 2018 Australian biographical film &quot;In Like Flynn&quot;.

In 2021, the Olivia de Havilland Theater was inaugurated at the American University of Paris.

<text>The Nile perch (Lates niloticus), also known as the African snook, Goliath perch, African barramundi, Goliath barramundi, Giant lates or the Victoria perch, is a species of freshwater fish in family Latidae of order Perciformes. It is widespread throughout much of the Afrotropical realm, being native to the Congo, Nile, Senegal, Niger and Lake Chad, Volta, Lake Turkana, and other river basins. It also occurs in the brackish waters of Lake Maryut in Egypt. The Nile perch is a fish of substantial economic and food-security importance in East Africa. Originally described as &quot;Labrus niloticus,&quot; among the marine wrasses, the species has also been referred to as &quot;Centropomus niloticus&quot;. Common names include African snook, Victoria perch (a misleading trade name, as the species is not native to Lake Victoria, though they have been introduced there), and many local names in various African languages, such as the Luo name &quot;mbuta&quot; or &quot;mputa&quot;. In Tanzania, it is called &quot;sangara&quot;, &quot;sankara&quot;, or &quot;chenku&quot;. In Francophone African countries, it is known as &quot;capitaine&quot;. Its name in the Hausa language is &quot;giwan ruwa&quot;, meaning &quot;water elephant&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;L. niloticus&quot; is silver in color with a blue tinge. It has distinctive dark-black eyes, with a bright-yellow outer ring. One of the largest freshwater fishes, it reaches a maximum length of nearly , weighing up to . Mature fish typically range from , although many fish are caught before they can grow this large.

Adult Nile perch occupy all habitats of a lake with sufficient oxygen concentrations, while juveniles are restricted to shallow or nearshore environments. A fierce predator that dominates its surroundings, the Nile perch feeds on fish (including its own species), crustaceans, molluscs, and insects; the juveniles also feed on zooplankton. Nile perch use schooling as a mechanism to protect themselves from other predators.

==Invasive species==
Nile perch have been introduced to many other lakes in Africa, including Lake Victoria and the artificial Lake Nasser. The World Conservation Union&#x27;s Invasive Species Specialist Group considers &quot;L. niloticus&quot; one of the world&#x27;s 100 worst invasive species.

The state of Queensland in Australia levies heavy fines on anyone found in possession of a living Nile perch, since it competes directly with the native barramundi, which is similar and grows to long, while the Nile perch grows to long.

The species is of great commercial importance as a food fish. The Nile perch is also popular with sport anglers, as it attacks artificial fishing lures, and it is also raised in aquaculture.

===Lake Victoria introduction===

The introduction of this species to Lake Victoria is one of the most cited examples of the negative effects alien species can have on ecosystems.

The Nile perch was introduced to Lake Victoria in East Africa in the 1950s, and has since been fished commercially. In 2003, Nile perch sales to the EU reached 169 million euros. Sport-fishing in the region of Uganda and Tanzania provided additional income from tourism.

Its introduction was ecologically disruptive and is attributed with causing the extinction or near-extinction of several hundred native species, with some populations fluctuating with commercial fishing and the actual Nile perch stocks. The Nile perch initially fed on native cichlids, but with decreasing availability of this prey, it now consumes mainly small shrimp and minnows.

The alteration of the native ecosystem had disruptive socioeconomic effects on local communities bordering the lake. Many local people have been displaced from their traditional occupations in the fishing trade and brought them into the cash economy, or before the establishment of export-oriented fisheries, turned them into economic refugees. At least initially, nets strong enough to hold adult Nile perch could not be manufactured locally and had to be imported for a high price.

The introduction of Nile perch has also had additional ecological effects on shore. Native cichlids were traditionally sun-dried, but because Nile perch have a high fat content (higher than cichlids), they need to be smoked to avoid spoiling. This has led to an increased demand for firewood in a region already hard-hit by deforestation, soil erosion, and desertification.

The Academy Award-nominated documentary &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Nightmare&quot; by Hubert Sauper (a French-Austrian-Belgian production, 2004) deals with the damage that has been caused by Nile perch introduction, including the import of weapons and ammunition in cargo planes from Europe, which are then used to export Nile perch, further exacerbating conflict and misery in the surrounding regions.

Regardless of whether it is considered positive or negative, the trophic web of Lake Victoria appears to have been drastically impoverished by the introduction of this novel near-top-level predator. While the ecosystem seems to be moving towards a new equilibrium, neither its former state nor the state of fisheries on Lake Victoria can ever easily be brought back.
==Threats==
Despite being a successful invasive species, the fish faces threats. Being a species of megafauna, the most obvious threats to the species are overfishing and the use of illegal fishing gear, as well as invasive water hyacinths. Prey depletion is also a factor, as it decreases the size of the fish and makes it vulnerable to larger predators, such as crocodiles.

==Export==
In 2021, The Uganda Fish Processors and Exporters Association called on the parliament to ban the local consumption of the species so as to protect its export.

==Religion==
Nile perch were involved with the worship of Neith. As a result nile perch were sometimes mummified. A deposit of several thousand mummified perch was excavated in an area to the west of Esna where there was a temple to Neith. Mummified perch have also been found at Gurob near a temple to Neith while perch statuettes have been found at Sais again in the context of a temple to Neith.

<doc id="88838" wikidata="Q1754174" url="?curid=88838" title="Powell Doctrine">
<text>The &quot;Powell Doctrine&quot; is a term named after General Colin Powell, for a military doctrine that Powell created in the run-up to the 1990–1991 Gulf War. The doctrine poses questions emphasizing national security interests, overwhelming strike capabilities with an emphasis on ground forces, and widespread public support, all of which have to be answered affirmatively before military action is taken. Powell&#x27;s doctrine is based in large part on the Weinberger Doctrine, devised by Caspar Weinberger during his tenure as Secretary of Defense (at which time Powell was Weinberger&#x27;s senior military assistant).

==Summary==
The Powell Doctrine states that a list of questions all have to be answered affirmatively before military action is taken by the United States:
# Is a vital national security interest threatened?
# Do we have a clear attainable objective?
# Have the risks and costs been fully and frankly analyzed?
# Have all other non-violent policy means been fully exhausted?
# Is there a plausible exit strategy to avoid endless entanglement?
# Have the consequences of our action been fully considered?
# Is the action supported by the American people?
# Do we have genuine broad international support?

As Powell said in an April 1, 2009, interview on &quot;The Rachel Maddow Show&quot;, it denotes a nation&#x27;s exhausting of all &quot;political, economic, and diplomatic means&quot;, which, only if all were futile, would result in the condition that the nation should resort to military force. Powell has also asserted that when a nation is engaging in war, every resource and tool should be used to achieve decisive force against the enemy, minimizing casualties, and ending the conflict quickly by forcing the weaker force to capitulate.

==Analysis and commentary==
The Powell Doctrine has been reported as an emerging legacy from the wars in Korea and Vietnam and the &quot;Never Again vs. Limited War&quot; policy debates (either win or don&#x27;t start versus value of limited war) and Caspar Weinberger&#x27;s Six Tests described in his 1984 speech &quot;The Uses of Military Power&quot;. It has been used to compare the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and the Iraq War.

<doc id="88839" wikidata="Q355201" url="?curid=88839" title="Alvin Plantinga">
<text>Alvin Carl Plantinga (born November 15, 1932) is an American analytic philosopher who works primarily in the fields of philosophy of religion, epistemology (particularly on issues involving epistemic justification), and logic.

From 1963 to 1982, Plantinga taught at Calvin University before accepting an appointment as the John A. O&#x27;Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He later returned to Calvin University to become the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy.

A prominent Christian philosopher, Plantinga served as president of the Society of Christian Philosophers from 1983 to 1986. He has delivered the Gifford Lectures twice and was described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &quot;America&#x27;s leading orthodox Protestant philosopher of God&quot;. In 2014, Plantinga was the 30th most-cited contemporary author in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. A fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, he was awarded the Templeton Prize in 2017.

Some of Plantinga&#x27;s most influential works include &quot;God and Other Minds&quot; (1967), &quot;The Nature of Necessity&quot; (1974), and a trilogy of books on epistemology, culminating in &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot; (2000) that was simplified in &quot;Knowledge and Christian Belief&quot; (2015).

== Biography ==
=== Family ===
Plantinga was born on November 15, 1932, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Cornelius A. Plantinga (1908–1994) and Lettie G. Bossenbroek (1908–2007), immigrants from the province of Friesland in the Netherlands. After Cornelius earned a PhD in philosophy from Duke University, he secured a teaching job in Michigan in 1941. Cornelius also had a master&#x27;s degree in psychology. He taught several academic subjects at different institutions throughout his career.

Plantinga married Kathleen De Boer in 1955. They had four children. One of Plantinga&#x27;s brothers, Cornelius &quot;Neal&quot; Plantinga Jr., is a theologian and the former president of Calvin Theological Seminary and another, Leon, is an emeritus professor of musicology at Yale University.

=== Education ===
As an adolescent, Alvin Plantinga&#x27;s family moved from Michigan to North Dakota for his father&#x27;s job at Jamestown College. At his father&#x27;s advice, Alvin skipped his last year of high school to enroll at Jamestown College in 1949 at 16. That year, his father accepted a teaching job at Calvin University which began in January 1950. Alvin Plantinga moved to Grand Rapids with his family and attended Calvin University for a semester. He applied to Harvard and was awarded a scholarship.

In the fall of 1950, Plantinga transferred to Harvard, where he spent two semesters. In 1951, during Harvard&#x27;s spring recess, Plantinga attended a few philosophy classes at Calvin University and was so impressed with Calvin philosophy professor William Harry Jellema that he returned in 1951 to study philosophy under him. In 1954, Plantinga began his graduate studies at the University of Michigan where he studied under William Alston, William Frankena, and Richard Cartwright, among others. A year later, in 1955, he transferred to Yale University where he received his PhD in 1958.

=== Teaching career ===
Plantinga began his career as an instructor in the philosophy department at Yale in 1957, and then in 1958, he became a professor of philosophy at Wayne State University during its heyday as a major center for analytic philosophy. In 1963, he accepted a teaching job at Calvin University, where he replaced the retiring Jellema. He then spent the next 19 years at Calvin before moving to the University of Notre Dame in 1982. He retired from the University of Notre Dame in 2010 and returned to Calvin University, where he holds the first William Harry Jellema Chair in Philosophy. He has trained metaphysics and epistemology-focused philosophers including Michael Bergmann, Michael Rea, and Trenton Merricks.

=== Awards and honors ===

Plantinga served as president of the American Philosophical Association, Western Division, from 1981 to 1982. and as president of the Society of Christian Philosophers from 1983 to 1986.

He has honorary degrees from Glasgow University (1982), Calvin University (1986), North Park College (1994), the Free University of Amsterdam (1995), Brigham Young University (1996), and Valparaiso University (1999). He was a Guggenheim Fellow, 1971–72, and elected a Fellow in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1975.

In 2006, the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s Center for Philosophy of Religion renamed its Distinguished Scholar Fellowship as the Alvin Plantinga Fellowship. The fellowship includes an annual lecture by the current Plantinga Fellow.

In 2012, the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Philosophy Department, History and Philosophy of Science Department, and the Center for the History and Philosophy of Science co-awarded Plantinga the Nicholas Rescher Prize for Systematic Philosophy, which he received with a talk titled, &quot;Religion and Science: Where the Conflict Really Lies&quot;.

In 2017, Baylor University&#x27;s Center for Christian Philosophy inaugurated the Alvin Plantinga Award for Excellence in Christian Philosophy. Awardees deliver a lecture at Baylor University and their name is put on a plaque with Plantinga&#x27;s image in the Institute for Studies in Religion. He was named the first fellow of the center as well.

He was awarded the 2017 Templeton Prize.

== Philosophical views ==
Plantinga has argued that some people can know that God exists as a basic belief, requiring no argument. He developed this argument in two different ways: firstly, in &quot;God and Other Minds&quot; (1967), by drawing an equivalence between the teleological argument and the common sense view that people have of other minds existing by analogy with their own minds. Plantinga has also developed a more comprehensive epistemological account of the nature of warrant which allows for the existence of God as a basic belief.

Plantinga has also argued that there is no logical inconsistency between the existence of evil and the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, wholly good God.

=== Problem of evil ===

Plantinga proposed a &quot;free-will defense&quot; in a volume edited by Max Black in 1965, which attempts to refute the logical problem of evil, the argument that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God. Plantinga&#x27;s argument (in a truncated form) states that &quot;It is possible that God, even being omnipotent, could not create a world with free creatures who never choose evil. Furthermore, it is possible that God, even being omnibenevolent, would desire to create a world which contains evil if moral goodness requires free moral creatures.&quot;

However, the argument&#x27;s handling of natural evil has been disputed. According to the &quot;Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;, the argument also &quot;conflicts with important theistic doctrines&quot; such as the notion of a heaven where free saved souls reside without doing evil, and the idea that God has free will yet is wholly good. Critics thus maintain that, if we take such doctrines to be (as Christians usually have), God could have created free creatures that always do right, contra Plantinga&#x27;s claim. J. L. Mackie saw Plantinga&#x27;s free-will defense as incoherent.

Plantinga&#x27;s well-received book &quot;God, Freedom and Evil&quot;, written in 1974, gave his response to what he saw as the incomplete and uncritical view of theism&#x27;s criticism of theodicy. Plantinga&#x27;s contribution stated that when the issue of a comprehensive doctrine of freedom is added to the discussion of the goodness of God and the omnipotence of God then it is not possible to exclude the presence of evil in the world after introducing freedom into the discussion. Plantinga&#x27;s own summary occurs in his discussion titled &quot;Could God Have Created a World Containing Moral Good but No Moral Evil&quot;, where he states his conclusion that, &quot;... the price for creating a world in which they produce moral good is creating one in which they also produce moral evil.&quot;

=== Reformed epistemology ===

What Plantinga calls &quot;Reformed epistemology&quot; holds that belief in God can be rational and justified even without arguments or evidence for the existence of God. More specifically, he argues belief in God is properly basic, and due to a religious externalist epistemology, he claims that it could be justified independently of evidence. His externalist epistemology, called &quot;proper functionalism&quot;, is a form of epistemological reliabilism.

Plantinga discusses his view of Reformed epistemology and proper functionalism in a three-volume series. In the first book of the trilogy, &quot;&quot;, Plantinga introduces, analyzes, and criticizes 20th-century developments in analytic epistemology, particularly the works of Chisholm, BonJour, Alston, Goldman, and others. In the book, Plantinga argues specifically that the theories of what he calls &quot;warrant&quot;—what many others have called justification (Plantinga draws out a difference: justification is a property of a person holding a belief while warrant is a property of a belief)—put forth by these epistemologists have systematically failed to capture in full what is required for knowledge.

In the second book, &quot;Warrant and Proper Function&quot;, he introduces the notion of warrant as an alternative to justification and discusses topics like self-knowledge, memories, perception, and probability. Plantinga&#x27;s &quot;proper function&quot; account argues that as a necessary condition of having warrant, one&#x27;s &quot;belief-forming and belief-maintaining apparatus of powers&quot; are functioning properly—&quot;working the way it ought to work&quot;. Plantinga explains his argument for proper function with reference to a &quot;design plan&quot;, as well as an environment in which one&#x27;s cognitive equipment is optimal for use. Plantinga asserts that the design plan does not require a designer: &quot;it is perhaps possible that evolution (undirected by God or anyone else) has somehow furnished us with our design plans&quot;, but the paradigm case of a design plan is like a technological product designed by a human being (like a radio or a wheel). Ultimately, Plantinga argues that epistemological naturalism- i.e. epistemology that holds that warrant is dependent on natural faculties—is best supported by supernaturalist metaphysics—in this case, the belief in a creator God or designer who has laid out a design plan that includes cognitive faculties conducive to attaining knowledge.

According to Plantinga, a belief, B, is warranted if:

(1) the cognitive faculties involved in the production of B are functioning properly…; (2) your cognitive environment is sufficiently similar to the one for which your cognitive faculties are designed; (3) … the design plan governing the production of the belief in question involves, as purpose or function, the production of true beliefs…; and (4) the design plan is a good one: that is, there is a high statistical or objective probability that a belief produced in accordance with the relevant segment of the design plan in that sort of environment is true.

Plantinga seeks to defend this view of proper function against alternative views of proper function proposed by other philosophers which he groups together as &quot;naturalistic&quot;, including the &quot;functional generalization&quot; view of John Pollock, the evolutionary/etiological account provided by Ruth Millikan, and a dispositional view held by John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. Plantinga also discusses his evolutionary argument against naturalism in the later chapters of &quot;Warrant and Proper Function&quot;.

In 2000, the third book of the trilogy, &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot;, was published. In this volume, Plantinga&#x27;s warrant theory is the basis for his theological end: providing a philosophical basis for Christian belief, an argument for why Christian theistic belief can enjoy warrant. In the book, he develops two models for such beliefs, the &quot;A/C&quot; (Aquinas/Calvin) model, and the &quot;Extended A/C&quot; model. The former attempts to show that a belief in God can be justified, warranted and rational, while the Extended model tries to show that specifically Christian theological beliefs including the Trinity, the Incarnation, the resurrection of Christ, the atonement, salvation. etc. Under this model, Christians are justified in their beliefs because of the work of the Holy Spirit in bringing those beliefs about in the believer.

James Beilby has argued that the purpose of Plantinga&#x27;s &quot;Warrant&quot; trilogy, and specifically of his &quot;Warranted Christian Belief&quot;, is firstly to make a form of argument against religion impossible—namely, the argument that whether or not Christianity is true, it is irrational—so &quot;the skeptic would have to shoulder the formidable task of demonstrating the falsity of Christian belief&quot; rather than simply dismiss it as irrational. In addition, Plantinga is attempting to provide a philosophical explanation of how Christians should think about their own Christian belief.

=== Modal ontological argument ===

Plantinga has expressed a modal logic version of the ontological argument in which he uses modal logic to develop, in a more rigorous and formal way, Norman Malcolm&#x27;s and Charles Hartshorne&#x27;s modal ontological arguments.

Plantinga criticized Malcolm&#x27;s and Hartshorne&#x27;s arguments, and offered an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the necessary existence of the greatest possible being, it follows that there is a being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in &quot;some&quot; worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in this world.

In an attempt to resolve this problem, Plantinga differentiated between &quot;greatness&quot; and &quot;excellence&quot;. A being&#x27;s excellence in a particular world depends only on its properties in that world; a being&#x27;s greatness depends on its properties in all worlds. Therefore, the greatest possible being must have maximal excellence in every possible world. Plantinga then restated Malcolm&#x27;s argument, using the concept of &quot;maximal greatness&quot;. He argued that it is possible for a being with maximal greatness to exist, so a being with maximal greatness exists in a possible world. If this is the case, then a being with maximal greatness exists in every world, and therefore in this world.

The conclusion relies on a form of modal axiom S5, which states that if something is possibly true, then its possibility is necessary (it is possibly true in all worlds). Plantinga&#x27;s version of S5 suggests that &quot;To say that p is possibly necessarily true is to say that, with regard to one world, it is true at all worlds; but in that case it is true at all worlds, and so it is simply necessary.&quot; A version of his argument is as follows:

# A being has &quot;maximal excellence&quot; in a given possible world &quot;W&quot; if and only if it is omnipotent, omniscient and wholly good in &quot;W&quot;; and
# A being has &quot;maximal greatness&quot; if it has maximal excellence in every possible world.
# It is possible that there is a being that has maximal greatness. (Premise)
# Therefore, possibly, it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly good being exists.
# Therefore, (by axiom S5) it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.
# Therefore, an omniscient, omnipotent and perfectly good being exists.

Plantinga argued that, although the first premise is not rationally established, it is not contrary to reason. Michael Martin argued that, if certain components of perfection are contradictory, such as omnipotence and omniscience, then the first premise is contrary to reason. Martin also proposed parodies of the argument, suggesting that the existence of anything can be demonstrated with Plantinga&#x27;s argument, provided it is defined as perfect or special in every possible world.

Another Christian philosopher, William Lane Craig, characterizes Plantinga&#x27;s argument in a slightly different way:
# It is possible that a maximally great being exists.
# If it is possible that a maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world.
# If a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world.
# If a maximally great being exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world.
# If a maximally great being exists in the actual world, then a maximally great being exists.
# Therefore, a maximally great being exists.
According to Craig, premises (2)–(5) are relatively uncontroversial among philosophers, but &quot;the epistemic entertainability of premise (1) (or its denial) does not guarantee its metaphysical possibility.&quot; Furthermore, Richard M. Gale argued that premise three, the &quot;possibility premise&quot;, begs the question. He stated that one only has the epistemic right to accept the premise if one understands the nested modal operators, and that if one understands them within the system S5—without which the argument fails—then one understands that &quot;possibly necessarily&quot; is in essence the same as &quot;necessarily&quot;. Thus the premise begs the question because the conclusion is embedded within it.
On S5 systems in general, James Garson writes that &quot;the words &#x27;necessarily&#x27; and &#x27;possibly&#x27;, have many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind.&quot;

=== Evolutionary argument against naturalism ===

In Plantinga&#x27;s evolutionary argument against naturalism, he argues that if evolution is true, it undermines naturalism. His basic argument is that if evolution and naturalism are both true, human cognitive faculties evolved to produce beliefs that have survival value (maximizing one&#x27;s success at the four Fs: &quot;feeding, fleeing, fighting, and reproducing&quot;), not necessarily to produce beliefs that are true. Thus, since human cognitive faculties are tuned to survival rather than truth in the naturalism-evolution model, there is reason to doubt the veracity of the products of those same faculties, including naturalism and evolution themselves. On the other hand, if God created man &quot;in his image&quot; by way of an evolutionary process (or any other means), then Plantinga argues our faculties would probably be reliable.

The argument does not assume any necessary correlation (or uncorrelation) between true beliefs and survival. Making the contrary assumption—that there is, in fact, a relatively strong correlation between truth and survival—if human belief-forming apparatus evolved giving a survival advantage, then it ought to yield truth since true beliefs confer a survival advantage. Plantinga counters that, while there may be overlap between true beliefs and beliefs that contribute to survival, the two kinds of beliefs are not the same, and he gives the following example with a man named Paul:

The argument has received favorable notice from Thomas Nagel and William Lane Craig, but has also been criticized as seriously flawed, for example, by Elliott Sober.

=== View on naturalism and evolution ===
Even though Plantinga believes that God could have used Darwinian processes to create the world, he stands firm against philosophical naturalism. He said in an interview on the relationship between science and religion that:

Religion and science share more common ground than you might think, though science can&#x27;t prove, it presupposes that there has been a past for example, science does not cover the whole of the knowledge enterprise.

Plantinga participated in groups that support the Intelligent Design Movement, and was a member of the &quot;Ad Hoc Origins Committee&quot; that supported Philip E. Johnson&#x27;s 1991 book &quot;Darwin on Trial&quot;, he also provided a back-cover endorsement of Johnson&#x27;s book: &quot;Shows how Darwinian evolution has become an idol.&quot;

He was a Fellow of the (now defunct) pro-intelligent design International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design, and has presented at a number of intelligent design conferences. In a March 2010 article in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, philosopher of science Michael Ruse labeled Plantinga as an &quot;open enthusiast of intelligent design&quot;. In a letter to the editor, Plantinga made the following response:
Like any Christian (and indeed any theist), I believe that the world has been created by God, and hence &quot;intelligently designed&quot;. The hallmark of intelligent design, however, is the claim that this can be shown scientifically; I&#x27;m dubious about that.

...As far as I can see, God certainly could have used Darwinian processes to create the living world and direct it as he wanted to go; hence evolution as such does not imply that there is no direction in the history of life. What does have that implication is not evolutionary theory itself, but &quot;unguided&quot; evolution, the idea that neither God nor any other person has taken a hand in guiding, directing or orchestrating the course of evolution. But the scientific theory of evolution, sensibly enough, says nothing one way or the other about divine guidance. It doesn&#x27;t say that evolution is divinely guided; it also doesn&#x27;t say that it isn&#x27;t. Like almost any theist, I reject unguided evolution; but the contemporary scientific theory of evolution just as such—apart from philosophical or theological add-ons—doesn&#x27;t say that evolution is unguided. Like science in general, it makes no pronouncements on the existence or activity of God.
The attitude that he proposes and elaborates upon in &quot;Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion and Naturalism&quot; is that there is no tension between religion and science, that the two go hand in hand, and that the actual conflict lies between naturalism and science.

<text>Henry Lewis Stimson (September 21, 1867 – October 20, 1950) was an American statesman, lawyer, and Republican Party politician. Over his long career, he emerged as a leading figure in U.S. foreign policy by serving in both Republican and Democratic administrations. He served as Secretary of War (1911–1913) under President William Howard Taft, Secretary of State (1929–1933) under President Herbert Hoover, and again Secretary of War (1940–1945) under Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman, overseeing American military efforts during World War II.

The son of the surgeon Lewis Atterbury Stimson and Candace C. Stimson (née Wheeler, daughter of Candace Thurber Wheeler) Stimson became a Wall Street lawyer after graduating from Harvard Law School. He served as a United States Attorney under President Theodore Roosevelt and prosecuted several antitrust cases. After he was defeated in the 1910 New York gubernatorial election, Stimson served as Secretary of War under Taft. He continued the reorganization of the United States Army that had begun under his mentor, Elihu Root. After the outbreak of World War I, Stimson became part of the Preparedness Movement. He served as an artillery officer in France after the United States entered the war. From 1927 to 1929, he served as Governor-General of the Philippines under President Calvin Coolidge.

In 1929, President Hoover appointed Stimson as Secretary of State. Stimson sought to avoid a worldwide naval race and thus helped negotiate the London Naval Treaty. He protested the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, which instituted the Stimson Doctrine of nonrecognition of international territorial changes that are executed by force. After World War II broke out in Europe, Stimson accepted President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s appointment to return as Secretary of War. After the U.S. entered the war, Stimson, working very closely with Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall, took charge of raising and training 13 million soldiers and airmen, supervised the spending of a third of the nation&#x27;s GDP on the Army and the Air Forces, helped formulate military strategy, and oversaw the Manhattan Project to build the first atomic bombs. He supported the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but convinced Truman to take the historic city of Kyoto off the atom bomb target list. During and after the war, Stimson strongly opposed the Morgenthau Plan, which would have deindustrialized and partitioned Germany into several smaller states. He also insisted on judicial proceedings against Nazi war criminals, which led to the Nuremberg trials.

Stimson retired from office in September 1945 and died in 1950.

==Early life and career==

Stimson was born in 1867 in Manhattan, New York City, the son of Lewis Atterbury Stimson, a prominent surgeon, and his wife, the former Candace Thurber Wheeler. When he was nine, his mother died of kidney failure, and he was then sent to boarding school.

He spent summers with his grandmother Candace Wheeler at her Catskills country house and played with his uncle Dunham Wheeler, who was almost the same age, in &quot;the Armory&quot;, which was their nickname for one corner of a large room in the house. Roaming the Catskill Mountains, he grew to love the outdoors and would become an avid sportsman.
He was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he gained a lifelong interest in religion and a close relationship with the school. He later donated Woodley, his Washington, D.C. estate, to the school in his will (the property is now the Maret School). He was an honorary lifetime member of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Boone and Crockett Club, North America&#x27;s first wildlife conservation organization. He was a Phillips trustee from 1905 to 1947 and served as president of the board from 1935 to 1945. He then attended Yale College, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He joined Skull and Bones, a secret society that afforded many contacts for the rest of his life. He graduated in 1888 and attended Harvard Law School, where he graduated in 1890. He joined the prestigious Wall Street law firm of Root and Clark in 1891 and became a partner in 1893. Elihu Root, a future Secretary of War and Secretary of State, became a major influence on and role model for Stimson.

Stimson developed a close relationship with Alfred Lee Loomis his first cousin twenty years his junior, and &quot;became the father that Loomis never had&quot;; while Loomis became the son that Stimson could not have because he was sterile.

In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Stimson U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, where Stimson made a distinguished record prosecuting antitrust cases. He later served from 1937 to 1939 as president of the New York City Bar Association, where a medal honoring service as a U.S. Attorney is still awarded in his honor.

Stimson was defeated as Republican candidate for Governor of New York in 1910.

He joined the Council on Foreign Relations at its inception and was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;the group&#x27;s quintessential member&quot;.

==Secretary of War (1911–1913)==
In 1911, President William Howard Taft appointed Stimson as Secretary of War. Stimson continued the reorganization of the army that had begun by Elihu Root, which improved its efficiency prior to its vast expansion in World War I. In 1913, Stimson left office following the accession of President Woodrow Wilson.

==World War I==
Following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Stimson was a strong supporter of Britain and France, although also supported U.S. neutrality. He called for preparation of a large, powerful army and was active in the privately funded Plattsburg Training Camp Movement to train potential officers.

After the U.S. declared war on the German Empire in April 1917, Stimson was one of the 18 men selected by former President Theodore Roosevelt to raise a volunteer infantry division for service in France in 1917. However, President Woodrow Wilson refused to make use of the volunteers, and the unit was disbanded. Stimson subsequently served in the regular U.S. Army in France as an artillery officer and reached the rank of colonel in August 1918. He continued his military service in the Organized Reserve Corps and rose to the rank of brigadier general in 1922.

==Nicaragua and Philippines==
In 1927, Stimson was sent by President Calvin Coolidge to Nicaragua to negotiate an end to the Nicaraguan Civil War. Stimson wrote that Nicaraguans &quot;were not fitted for the responsibilities that go with independence and still less fitted for popular self-government.&quot; He opposed independence for the Philippines for the same reason after he had been appointed Governor-General of the Philippines, an office that he held from 1927 to 1929.

==Secretary of State==
Stimson returned to the cabinet in 1929, when U.S. President Herbert Hoover appointed him US Secretary of State. Both served until 1933. Stimson lived in the Woodley Mansion in Washington, D.C., where he remained through 1946.

Shortly after being appointed as the new Secretary of State, Stimson shut down the Cipher Bureau (U.S. cryptanalytic service, later known as the &quot;Black Chamber&quot;) in 1929. According to the NSA&#x27;s Center for Cryptologic History, Stimson likely dissolved the bureau for budgetary reasons. But he also considered intercepting diplomatic communications unethical, reputedly saying: &quot;Gentlemen do not read each other&#x27;s mail.&quot; By the advent of World War II in 1940 it appears Stimson had changed his mind, at least as to the ethics of codebreaking.

In 1930 and 1931, Stimson was the Chairman of the U.S. delegation to the London Naval Conference of 1930. In the following year, he was the Chairman of the U.S. delegation to World Disarmament Conference in Geneva. The same year, the United States issued the &quot;Stimson Doctrine&quot; in response to Japanese invasion of Manchuria. It stated that the U.S. refused to recognize any situation or treaty that limited U.S. treaty rights or was brought about by aggression.

On October 5, 1931, the League received a strongly-worded letter from Stimson urging it to pressure Japan against aggression in China, and informing the League that the U.S. would support the League&#x27;s actions.

Returning to private life at the end of the Hoover administration, Stimson was an outspoken opponent of Japanese aggression.

==Secretary of War (1940–1945)==
 After World War II broke out, Roosevelt returned Stimson to his post at the head of the War Department, in July 1940. The choice of Stimson, a conservative Republican (and anti-New Dealer) and Frank Knox as secretary of the Navy was a calculated effort by the president to win bipartisan support for what was considered the almost-inevitable U.S. entrance into the war.

In the seventeen months leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Stimson, working side-by-side with U.S. Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall (in offices adjacent to one another where the door between them was deliberately left open at all times) led efforts to prepare an unprepared America for war. Together, Stimson and Marshall had to build up the Army and Army Air Corps, organize housing and training for the soldiers, and oversee the design, testing, production, and distribution of the various machines, weapons, and materials required to support the country and its allies.

Ten days before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Stimson entered in his diary the following statement: &quot;[Roosevelt] brought up the event that we are likely to be attacked perhaps next Monday, for the Japanese are notorious for making an attack without warning, and the question was what we should do. The question was how we should maneuver them into the position of firing the first shot without allowing too much danger to ourselves.&quot;

With respect to the war in Europe, Stimson was &quot;pro-British&quot; even before Pearl Harbor. Stimson&#x27;s view was the British Royal Navy, fighting Nazi Germany in the Atlantic, was protecting America, and was the reason the U.S. did not (for the time being) &quot;have to do the fighting ourselves.&quot; Stimson said America should &quot;rely on the shield of the British Navy,&quot; and that on that basis the U.S. should do everything possible to arm and supply the British.

Because of this view, when the Senate voted to confirm him, all of the most notorious isolationist Senators such as Henrik Shipstead and Ernest Lundeen of Minnesota, Gerald Nye of North Dakota, Robert Marion La Follette of Wisconsin, David I. Walsh of Massachusetts and Burton K. Wheeler of Montana voted against his confirmation on the grounds he was &quot;too pro-British&quot; whereas all of the most &quot;Anglophile&quot; Senators such as John H. Bankhead II and J. Lister Hill of Alabama, Kenneth McKellar and Tom Stewart of Tennessee, Harry Schwartz and Joseph C. O&#x27;Mahoney of Wyoming all spoke in favor of Stimson and his foreign policy views (and voted to confirm him as Secretary of War). The British government watched his confirmation vote closely, hoping he would have enough votes to get confirmed by the Senate, and they celebrated when he was confirmed.

Stimson and Frank Knox, both &quot;vigorous interventionists&quot;, were confirmed by the Senate at the same time. Both advocated American entry into World War II on the side of the United Kingdom, earning them the title of &quot;war hawks&quot; from isolationists. Knox was described as &quot;&quot;even more&quot; of a Hawk than Stimson.&quot; Stimson was hired by FDR explicitly to replace Harry Hines Woodring, Knox was hired explicitly to replace Charles Edison on the grounds that Edison and Woodring were isolationists who did not agree with the philosophy of helping Great Britain in their war against the Nazis. Stimson referred to the views of isolationists as &quot;hopelessly twisted.&quot;

The power of isolationists explains why Stimson did not record &quot;shock, horror or anger&quot; after Roosevelt informed him of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Instead, he wrote, &quot;my first feeling was of relief that the indecision was over and that a crisis had come in a way which would unite our people (…) For I feel this country united has practically nothing to fear while the apathy and visions stirred up by unpatriotic men have been hitherto very discouraging.&quot;

During the war, Stimson oversaw a great expansion of the military, including drafting and training of 13 million soldiers and airmen as well as purchasing and transporting 30 percent of the nation&#x27;s industrial output to the battlefields. In addition to George Marshall, Stimson worked closely with his top aides Robert P. Patterson, who succeeded Stimson as secretary; Robert Lovett, who handled the Air Force; Harvey Bundy; and John J. McCloy, Assistant Secretary of War.

Stimson was 73 when he took the reins as War Secretary, and many critics questioned if a man of his age could tackle a job that was so enormous. He defied all naysayers and plunged into the task with &quot;an energy that men 20 years his junior could not have mustered.&quot; However, at 75, Stimson confessed that he was &quot;feeling very tired. The unconscious strain has been pretty heavy on me.&quot;

===Japanese American internment===

Stimson was initially opposed to the internment of Japanese Americans away from the West Coast, but he eventually gave in to pro-exclusion military advisers and secured Roosevelt&#x27;s final approval for the incarceration program. The administration was split in the wake of Pearl Harbor, with Justice Department officials arguing against &quot;evacuation&quot; and the Army and the War Department leaders demanding the immediate relocation. Still opposed to the idea of wholesale eviction, Stimson spent much of January 1942 in fielding calls from military advisers and West Coast politicians on the potential threat of a Japanese American fifth column. By February, John McCloy and others from the pro-exclusion camp had won him over.

On February 11, Stimson and McCloy briefed in a phone conference Roosevelt, who gave his Secretary of War the go-ahead to pursue whatever course he saw fit. McCloy contacted Karl Bendetsen to begin formulating a removal strategy immediately after. Roosevelt granted Stimson the final approval to carry out the eviction of West Coast Japanese Americans on February 17, and two days later, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which authorized the establishment of military zones that excluded certain persons.

As the Western Defense Command began circulating civilian exclusion orders, a new debate formed regarding Japanese Americans in the Territory of Hawaii. Stimson joined other officials to push for the exclusion of all &quot;enemy alien&quot; Japanese from the islands. (Japanese immigrants were prohibited by law from naturalization and so were classified as enemy aliens, regardless of their residential status.) However, Japanese Hawaiians were the largest ethnic group in the territory and the foundation of the Island&#x27;s labor force. Since mass removal was infeasible both economically and politically, Stimson&#x27;s proposal quickly fell through.

Although Stimson believed it to be &quot;quite impossible&quot; to determine the loyalty of Japanese Americans and eventually came to support the army&#x27;s incarceration program, he remained unconvinced on the legality of the policy: &quot;The second generation Japanese can only be evacuated either as part of a total evacuation, giving access to the areas only by permits, or by frankly trying to put them out on the ground that their racial characteristics are such that we cannot understand or trust even the citizen Japanese. The latter is the fact but I am afraid it will make a tremendous hole in our constitutional system.&quot;

Stimson authorized the release of Japanese Americans from camp in May 1944 but postponed permission for them to return to the West Coast until after the November elections to avoid controversy in Roosevelt&#x27;s upcoming campaign.

===General Patton===

On November 21, 1943, the news broke that General George S. Patton, commander of the U.S. Seventh Army, had slapped an enlisted man who suffered from nervous exhaustion at a medical evacuation hospital in Sicily. The incident caused a storm of controversy, and members of Congress called for Patton to be relieved of command. General Dwight Eisenhower opposed any move to recall General Patton from the European Theater and said privately, &quot;Patton is indispensable to the war effort – one of the guarantors of our victory.&quot; Stimson and McCloy agreed; Stimson told the Senate Patton would be retained because of the need for his &quot;aggressive, winning leadership in the bitter battles which are to come before final victory.&quot;

===Morgenthau Plan===
Stimson strongly opposed the Morgenthau Plan to deindustrialize and to partition Germany into several smaller states. The plan also envisioned the deportation and the summary imprisonment of anybody suspected of responsibility for war crimes. Initially, Roosevelt had been sympathetic to the plan, but Stimson&#x27;s opposition and the public outcry when the plan was leaked made Roosevelt backtrack. Stimson thus retained overall control of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, and despite the plan&#x27;s influence on the early occupation, it never became official policy. Explaining his opposition to the plan, Stimson insisted to Roosevelt that 10 European countries, including Russia, depended upon German trade and its production of raw materials. He also stated that it was inconceivable that the &quot;gift of nature,&quot; which was populated by peoples of &quot;energy, vigor, and progressiveness,&quot; should be turned into a &quot;ghost territory&quot; or &quot;dust heap.&quot;

What Stimson most feared, however, was that a subsistence-level economy would turn the anger of Germans against the Allies and thereby &quot;obscure the guilt of the Nazis and the viciousness of their doctrines and their acts.&quot; Stimson pressed similar arguments on Harry S. Truman, when he became president, in the spring of 1945.

Stimson, a lawyer, insisted, against the initial wishes of both Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, on proper judicial proceedings against leading war criminals. He and the War Department, drafted the first proposals for an International Tribunal, which soon received backing from Truman. Stimson&#x27;s plan eventually led to the Nuremberg Trials of 1945–1946, which have strongly influenced the development of international law.

===Atomic bomb===
As Secretary of War, Stimson took direct and personal control of the entire atomic bomb project, with immediate supervision over Major General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project. Both Roosevelt and Truman followed Stimson&#x27;s advice on every aspect of the bomb, and Stimson overruled military officers when they opposed his views. 

One example of Stimson using his authority in this regard is an episode in which Stimson changed the list of potential targets for the first (and if necessary second) attacks on Japan using the new atomic bombs produced by the Manhattan Project. The original target list included the city of Kyoto, a place of immense cultural and historical significance to the Japanese people. While Kyoto may have satisfied the military criteria for a useful target, Stimson objected, declaring in a meeting if the Interim Committee on June 1, 1945, &quot;...there was one city that they must not bomb without my permission and that was Kyoto.&quot;

Stimson&#x27;s reasons for this decision have been obscured by popular myth. One well-traveled story is that Stimson didn&#x27;t want to bomb Kyoto because he had spent his honeymoon there, and presumably had a nostalgic or sentimental attachment to the city (this motive is one of the only assertions made by Stimson&#x27;s character in the hugely popular 2023 film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;). There is no concrete evidence for this version of events, nor is there any record of Stimson ever expressing such a motive. Stimson did travel briefly to Kyoto in 1926, and spent a night there in 1929 as well, but both of these visits were more than 30 years after he and his wife married.

In his personal diary, Stimson recorded his concern that annihilating such an important cultural site could generate long-lasting hostility among the Japanese people, which could in turn make Japan more friendly to the Soviet Union. In July 1945, while attending the Potsdam conference between Truman, Churchill and Stalin, which took place only two weeks before the first atomic bomb was dropped, Stimson wrote: 

The Manhattan Project was managed by Major General Groves (Corps of Engineers) with a staff of reservists and many thousands of civilian scientists and engineers. Groves nominally reported directly to General George Marshall, but Stimson was really in charge. Stimson secured the necessary money and approval from Roosevelt and from Congress, ensured that Manhattan had the highest priorities, and controlled all plans for the use of the bomb. Stimson successfully tried to get &quot;Little Boy&quot; (the Hiroshima bomb) dropped within hours of its earliest possible availability. Japan was to be forced to surrender, and the bombing of Hiroshima August 6 was likely a finishing blow for Tokyo.

Stimson ultimately concluded if the U.S. had guaranteed the Japanese preservation of the imperial constitutional monarchy, Japan might have surrendered and prevented the use of atomic bombs. Historians debate whether the impact of continued blockade, relentless bombing, and the Soviet Union&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria would have forced Japanese Emperor Hirohito to surrender some time in late 1945 or early 1946 without the use of atomic bombs but with massive Allied casualties.

After American journalist John Hersey&#x27;s account of the Hiroshima atomic bombing became a media sensation, Stimson and others published their own article &quot;The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb&quot;. It argued the atomic bombings saved the Japanese from themselves, that demonstrating it would have been impractical, and American casualties from a potential invasion would exceed 1 million, although military documents from July 1945 estimated under 200,000 casualties (other estimates put the casualties as high as 4 million). Stimson also sidestepped questions such as the suffering of the victims and the radioactive qualities of the bombs, saying they had a &quot;revolutionary character&quot; or &quot;unfamiliar nature&quot;. Because his article was the first official account of the reasonings behind the bombings, news outlets that were covering Hersey&#x27;s &quot;Hiroshima&quot; began to cover Stimson&#x27;s article instead. President Truman commended Stimson, and McGeorge Bundy, who had worked with Stimson on the article, later wrote, &quot;We deserve some sort of medal.&quot;

===Stimson&#x27;s vision===
Stimson looked beyond the immediate end of the war. He was the only top government official to try to predict the meaning of the Atomic Age, and he envisioned a new era in human affairs. For half-a-century, he had worked to inject order, science, and moralism into matters of law, state, and diplomacy. The impact of the atomic bomb, he thought, would go far beyond military concerns to encompass diplomacy, world affairs, business, economics, and science. Above all, Stimson stated that the &quot;most terrible weapon ever known in human history&quot; opened up &quot;the opportunity to bring the world into a pattern in which the peace of the world and our civilization can be saved.&quot; He thought the very destructiveness of the new weaponry would shatter the ages-old belief that wars could be advantageous. It might now be possible to call a halt to the use of destruction as a ready solution to human conflicts. Indeed, society&#x27;s new control over the most elemental forces of nature finally &quot;caps the climax of the race between man&#x27;s growing technical power for destructiveness and his psychological power of self-control and group control—his moral power.&quot; To this end, Stimson advocated collaboration with the Soviet Union and genuine international control of atomic technology and weaponry, including possibly turning them over to the United Nations. He was opposed in this by other members of the Truman administration like James Byrnes. Stimson&#x27;s vision of such a new world order, shared in part by many atomic scientists as well as Albert Einstein, would have meant yielding some sovereignty to something akin to a world government.

In 1931, when Japan had invaded Manchuria, Stimson, as Secretary of State, proclaimed the Stimson Doctrine: no fruits of illegal aggression would ever be recognized by the United States. Although Japan ignored it, according to Stimson, the wheels of justice had now turned and the &quot;peace-loving&quot; nations, as Stimson called them, had the chance to punish Japan&#x27;s misdeeds in a manner that would warn aggressor nations never again to invade their neighbors. To validate the new moral order, he believed that the atomic bomb had to be used against combatants and workers in the war. Hiroshima and Nagasaki had both contained combatant bases and major centers of war industry that employed tens of thousands of civilians. The question for Stimson was not one of whether the weapon should be used. Involved were the simple issue of ending a horrible war and the more subtle and more important question of the possibility of genuine peace among nations. Stimson&#x27;s decision involved the fate of mankind, and he posed the problem to the world in such clear and articulate fashion that there was a nearly-unanimous agreement mankind had to find a way so that atomic weapons would never be used again to kill people.

==Personal life==
In July 1893, Stimson married the former Mabel Wellington White, a great-great-granddaughter of one of the Founding Fathers, Roger Sherman, and the sister of Elizabeth Selden Rogers. An adult case of mumps had left Stimson infertile, and they had no children.

==Later life==
Stimson officially announced his retirement on September 21, 1945. Afterwards, he wrote his memoirs with the aid of McGeorge Bundy. &quot;On Active Service in Peace and War&quot; was published by Harper in 1948 to critical acclaim. It is often cited by historians, as are the 170,000 typed pages of candid diaries that Stimson dictated at the end of every day. The diary is now in the Yale University Library; parts have been published in microfilm.

Two months after leaving office, in November 1945, Stimson suffered a heart attack from which he recovered, although he suffered a speech impediment. In the summer of 1950, Stimson fell and broke his leg and was confined to a wheelchair. On October 20, one month after his 83rd birthday, he succumbed to complications from a second heart attack. Stimson died at his estate Highhold in Huntington, New York. He is buried in the adjacent town of Laurel Hollow, in the cemetery of St. John&#x27;s Church. He was the last surviving member of William Howard Taft&#x27;s cabinet.
==Anecdote==
Theodore H. White noted that Stimson had known and served under more Presidents than any other American citizen of his era. According to White, a short time before Stimson died, he had been asked by a friend which of the many Presidents that he had been acquainted with &quot;had been the best.&quot; After a few moments of reflection, Stimson indicated his answer to the query depended on what was meant by &quot;the best.&quot; He said that if it meant the most efficient man to hold the office, the answer was William Howard Taft. If, however, the question meant the greatest president, the answer was &quot;Roosevelt,&quot; but Stimson could not decide whether the first name would be Theodore or Franklin. Stimson said both &quot;understood the use of power&quot; but as well &quot;knew the enjoyment of power.&quot;

==Legacy==
Mount Stimson in Montana&#x27;s Glacier National Park is named after Stimson, who in the 1890s hiked and assisted George Bird Grinnell in surveying the area and later supported creating the park.

The Henry L. Stimson Center, a private research institute in Washington, DC, advocates what it says is Stimson&#x27;s &quot;practical, non-partisan approach&quot; to international relations.

The &quot;Benjamin Franklin&quot;-class ballistic missile submarine was commissioned in 1966.

Stimson&#x27;s name graces the Henry L. Stimson Middle School in Huntington Station, Long Island; a residential building on the campus of Stony Brook University; as well as a dorm at his alma mater Phillips Academy.

Stimson is also commemorated by the New York City Bar Association, where he served as president from 1937 to 1939, with the Henry L. Stimson Medal. The medal is awarded annually to outstanding Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.

==In popular culture==
Stimson has been portrayed in nearly a dozen movies and television shows about World War II and its aftermath, including &quot;Manhattan (2014–2015)&quot;, &quot;Truman&quot; (1995), &quot;Truman at Potsdam&quot; (1995), &quot;Fat Man and Little Boy&quot; (1989), &quot;Day One&quot; (1989), &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; (1988), &quot;Race for the Bomb&quot; (1987), &quot;Churchill and the Generals&quot; (1981), &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (1980), &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023), &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; (1970), and &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot; (1947).

In the alternate history short story &quot;Truth, Justice, and the American Way&quot; by Lawrence Watt-Evans contained in the 1992 alternate history anthology &quot;Alternate Presidents&quot; by Mike Resnick, Stimson succeeded Hoover (who defeated Roosevelt in 1932 after Al Smith ran as a third party candidate and split the Democratic vote) as president in 1936, defeating Roosevelt. He once again defeated Roosevelt in 1940.

<text>The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), also known as the monkey-eating eagle or great Philippine eagle, is a critically endangered species of eagle of the family Accipitridae which is endemic to forests in the Philippines. It has brown and white-colored plumage, a shaggy crest, and generally measures in length and weighs .

The Philippine eagle is considered the largest of the extant eagles in the world in terms of length and wing surface area, with only Steller&#x27;s sea eagle and the Harpy eagle being larger in terms of weight and bulk. It has been declared the national bird of the Philippines. It is also depicted in the Philippine one thousand-peso note The species had been classified by the IUCN Red List as Critically endangered with a declining population and is one of the most endangered raptors in the world. The most significant threat to the species is loss of habitat, a result of high levels of deforestation throughout most of its range. Since 2019, more than 20 eagles have been rescued mostly due to injuries from gunshot wounds.

Killing a Philippine eagle is a criminal offence, punishable by law with up to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment and heavy fines.

==Names==
The Philippine eagle has numerous native names in the Philippine languages. These include and (a Spanish loanword) in Tagalog; or in the Visayan languages; or in Maranao and Maguindanao; in Subanen; and or in the Manobo languages, Klata, Tagabawa, Mandaya, and Kalagan. Some of these names are also used for other large eagles in general, such as the white-breasted sea eagle (also called in Visayan). In modern Filipino, it is usually referred to as &quot;háribon&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;&quot;haring ibón&quot;,&quot; literally &quot;bird king&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The first European to study the species was the English explorer and naturalist John Whitehead in 1896, who observed the bird and whose servant, Juan, collected the first specimen a few weeks later. The skin of the bird was sent to William Robert Ogilvie-Grant in London in 1896, who initially showed it off in a local restaurant and described the species a few weeks later.

Upon its scientific discovery, the Philippine eagle was first called the monkey-eating eagle because of reports from natives of Bonga, Samar, where the species was first discovered, that it preyed exclusively on monkeys. These reports gave its generic name, from the Greek (πίθηκος, &quot;ape&quot; or &quot;monkey&quot;) and (-φάγος, &quot;eater of&quot;). The species name commemorates Jeffery Whitehead, the father of John Whitehead. Later studies revealed, however, that the alleged monkey-eating eagle also ate other animals, such as colugos, large snakes, monitor lizards, and even large birds such as Hornbills. This, coupled with the fact that the same name applied to the African Crowned eagle and the Central and South American Harpy eagle, it was renamed &quot;Philippine eagle&quot; in a 1978 proclamation by then-President Ferdinand Marcos. In 1995, it was declared a national emblem under President Fidel V. Ramos. This species has no recognized subspecies.

===Evolutionary history===
A 1919 study of the bird&#x27;s skeletal features led to the suggestion that the nearest relative was the Harpy eagle (&quot;Harpia harpyja&quot;). The species was included in the subfamily Harpiinae until a 2005 study of DNA sequences which identified them as not members of the group, finding instead that the nearest relatives are Snake eagles (Circaetinae), such as the bateleur. The species has subsequently been placed in the subfamily Circaetinae.

==Description==

The Philippine eagle&#x27;s nape is adorned with long, brown feathers that form a shaggy, mane-like crest. The eagle has a dark face and a creamy-brown nape and crown. The back of the Philippine eagle is dark brown, while the underside and underwings are white. The heavy legs are yellow, with large, powerful, dark claws, and the prominent, large, high-arched, deep beak is a bluish-gray. The eagle&#x27;s eyes are blue-gray. Juveniles are similar to adults except their upperpart feathers have pale fringes.
The Philippine eagle is typically reported as measuring in total length, but a survey of several specimens from some of the largest natural history collections in the world found the average was for males and for females. Based on the latter measurements, this makes it the longest extant species of eagle, as the average for the female equals the maximum reported for the harpy eagle and Steller&#x27;s sea eagle. The longest Philippine eagle reported anywhere and the longest eagle outside of the extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle is a specimen from Field Museum of Natural History with a length of , but it had been kept in captivity so may not represent the wild individuals due to differences in the food availability.

The level of sexual dimorphism in size is not certain, but the male is believed to be typically about 10% smaller than the female, and this is supported by the average length provided for males and females in one source. In many of the other large eagle species, the size difference between adult females and males can exceed 20%. For adult Philippine eagles, the complete weight range has been reported as , while others have found the average was somewhat lower than the above range would indicate, at for males and for females. One male (age not specified) was found to weigh . The Philippine eagle has a wingspan of and a wing chord length of .

The maximum reported weight is surpassed by two other eagles (the harpy and Steller&#x27;s sea eagles) and the wings are shorter than large eagles of open country (such as the white-tailed eagle, Steller&#x27;s sea eagle, martial eagle, or wedge-tailed eagle), but are quite broad. The tarsus of the Philippine eagle ties as the longest of any eagle from long, which is about the same length as that of the much smaller but relatively long-legged New Guinea eagle. The very large but laterally compressed bill rivals the size of Steller&#x27;s sea eagle&#x27;s as the largest bill for an extant eagle. Its bill averages in length from the gape. The tail is fairly long at , while another source lists a tail length of .

The most frequently heard noises made by the Philippine eagle are loud, high-pitched whistles ending with inflections in pitch. Additionally, juveniles have been known to beg for food by a series of high-pitched calls.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Philippine eagle is endemic to the Philippines and can be found on four major islands: eastern Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. The largest numbers of eagles reside on Mindanao, with between 82 and 233 breeding pairs. Only six pairs are found on Samar, two on Leyte, and a few on Luzon. It can be found in Northern Sierra Madre National Park on Luzon and Mount Apo, Mount Malindang, and Mount Kitanglad National Parks on Mindanao.

This eagle is found in dipterocarp and mid montane forests, particularly in steep areas. Its elevation ranges from the lowlands to mountains of over . Only an estimated of old-growth forest remain in the bird&#x27;s range. However, its total estimated range is about .

==Ecology and behavior==

Evolution in the Philippines, without other predators, made the eagles the dominant hunter in the Philippine forests. The Philippine eagle has a wide range of prey which includes birds, reptiles and mammals (mainly civets and colugos).
Each breeding pair requires a large home range to successfully raise a chick, thus the species is extremely vulnerable to deforestation. Earlier, the territory has been estimated at , but a study on Mindanao Island found the nearest distance between breeding pairs to be about on average, resulting in a circular plot of .

The species&#x27; flight is fast and agile, resembling the smaller hawks more than similar large birds of prey.

Juveniles in play behavior have been observed gripping knotholes in trees with their talons, and using their tails and wings for balance, inserting their heads into tree cavities. Additionally, they have been known to attack inanimate objects for practice, as well as attempt to hang upside down to work on their balance. As the parents are not nearby when this occurs, they apparently do not play a role in teaching the juvenile to hunt.

Life expectancy for a wild eagle is estimated to be from 30 to 60 years. A captive Philippine eagle lived for 41 years in Rome Zoo, and it was already an adult when it arrived at the zoo. Another captive Philippine eagle lived for 46 years at the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao City. However, wild birds on average are believed to live shorter lives than captive birds.

===Diet===
The Philippine eagle was known initially as the Philippine monkey-eating eagle because it was believed to feed on monkeys almost exclusively. The only two monkeys native to the Philippines are Philippine long-tailed macaque and common long-tailed macaques, both are subspecies of crab-eating macaque and weighing in males and in females. Though Philippine eagles do prey on these monkeys, they are an opportunist apex predator, taking prey based on their local level of abundance and ease. This misconception may have come from the first examined specimen which was found to have undigested pieces of a monkey in its stomach.

Prey specimens found at the eagle&#x27;s nest have ranged in size from a small bat weighing to a Philippine deer weighing . The primary prey is usually the tree squirrel-sized Philippine flying lemurs, which can make up an estimated 90% of the raptor&#x27;s diet in some locations. However, primary prey species vary from island to island depending on species availability, particularly in Luzon and Mindanao, because the islands are in different faunal regions. For example, flying lemurs are preferred prey in Mindanao, but are absent in Luzon. The primary prey for the eagles seen in Luzon are macaques, reptiles, and Northern Luzon giant cloud rat (&quot;Phloeomys pallidus&quot;) which can weigh twice as much as flying lemurs at . In many regions, civets are taken as supplemental prey, mainly cat-sized Asian palm civets (&quot;Paradoxurus hermaphroditus&quot;) but occasionally larger Malay civets (&quot;Viverra tangalunga&quot;). Other mammalian prey can include flying squirrels, tree squirrels, flying foxes, rats and mouse-deer. Birds are also taken, including large species such as owls, hawks and hornbills. Reptiles occasionally form a large part of their diet, snakes such as &quot;Ptyas luzonensis&quot; and &quot;Gonyosoma oxycephalum&quot; are mainly taken. Venomous pit vipers (Viperidae) are also taken as prey, and in one instance, a breeding pair delivered a Philippine cobra (&quot;Naja philippinensis&quot;) to the nest. Monitor lizards, including marbled water monitors (&quot;Varanus marmoratus&quot;) and even larger Northern Sierra Madre forest monitors (&quot;Varanus bitatawa&quot;) have been taken. While most of the prey consists of wild prey, they have been reported to capture domestic fowls (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;), cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;), young pigs (&quot;Sus domesticus&quot;) and small dogs (&quot;Canis familiaris&quot;).

Philippine eagles primarily use two hunting techniques. One is still-hunting, in which it watches for prey activity while sitting almost motionlessly on a branch near the canopy. The other is perch-hunting, which entails periodically gliding from one perch to another. While perch-hunting, they often work their way gradually down from the canopy down the branches, and if not successful in finding prey in their initial foray, they fly or circle back up to the top of the trees to work them again. Eagles in Mindanao often find success using the latter method while hunting flying lemurs, since they are nocturnal animals that try to use camouflage to protect themselves by day. Eagle pairs sometimes hunt troops of monkeys cooperatively, with one bird perching nearby to distract the primates, allowing the other to swoop in from behind, hopefully unnoticed, for the kill. Since the native macaque is aggressive and often around the same size as the eagle itself or even larger, up to in adult males, it is a potentially hazardous prey, and an eagle has been reported to suffer a broken leg after it struggled and fell along with a large male monkey.

===Reproduction===

The complete breeding cycle of the Philippine eagle lasts two years. The female matures sexually at five years of age and the male at seven. Like most eagles, the Philippine eagle is monogamous. Once paired, a couple remains together for the rest of their lives. If one dies, the remaining eagle often searches for a new mate to replace the one lost.

The beginning of courtship is signaled by nest-building, and the eagle remaining near its nest. Aerial displays also play a major role in the courtship. These displays include paired soaring over a nesting territory, the male chasing the female in a diagonal dive, and mutual talon presentation, where the male presents his talons to the female&#x27;s back and she flips over in midair to present her own talons. Advertisement displays coupled with loud calling have also been reported. The willingness of an eagle to breed is displayed by the eagle bringing nesting materials to the bird&#x27;s nest. Copulation follows and occurs repeatedly both on the nest and on nearby perches. The earliest courtship has been reported in July.

Breeding season is in July; birds on different islands, most notably Mindanao and Luzon, begin breeding at different ends of this range. The amount of rainfall and population of prey may also affect the breeding season. The nest is normally built on an emergent dipterocarp, or any tall tree with an open crown, in primary or disturbed forest. The nests are lined with green leaves, and can be around across. The nesting location is around or even more above the ground. As in many other large raptors, the eagle&#x27;s nest resembles a huge platform made of sticks. The eagle frequently reuses the same nesting site for several different chicks. Eight to 10 days before the egg is ready to be laid, the female is afflicted with a condition known as egg lethargy. In this experience, the female does not eat, drinks much water, and holds her wings droopingly. The female typically lays one egg in the late afternoon or at dusk, although occasionally two have been reported. If an egg fails to hatch or the chick dies early, the parents likely lay another egg the following year. Copulation may take place a few days after the egg is laid to enable another egg to be laid should the first one fail. The egg is incubated for 58 to 68 days (typically 62 days) after being laid. Both sexes participate in the incubation, but the female does the majority of incubating during the day and all of it at night.

Both sexes help feed the newly hatched eaglet. Additionally, the parents have been observed taking turns shielding the eaglet from the sun and rain until it is seven weeks old. The young eaglet fledges after four or five months. The earliest an eagle has been observed making a kill is 304 days after hatching. Both parents take care of the eaglet for a total of 20 months and, unless the previous nesting attempt had failed, the eagles can breed only in alternate years. The Philippine eagle rivals two other large tropical eagles, namely the crowned eagle and harpy eagle, for having the longest breeding cycle of any bird of prey. Even nests have no predators other than humans, as even known nest predators such as palm civets and macaques (being prey species) are likely to actively avoid any area with regular eagle activity.

==Conservation==

In 1994, the IUCN and BirdLife International listed this species as critically endangered. The IUCN believed that between 180 and 500 Philippine eagles survive in the Philippines. In 2015, about 600 were estimated to be left in the wild. The Zoological Society of London listed the Philippine eagle as the top 15 EDGE species, out of all the world&#x27;s recorded species, making it the Philippines&#x27; most &quot;evolutionary distinct and globally endangered&quot; species.

They are threatened primarily by deforestation through logging and expanding agriculture. Old-growth forest is being lost at a high rate, and most of the forest in the lowlands is owned by logging companies. Mining, pollution, exposure to pesticides that affect breeding, and poaching are also major threats. Additionally, they are occasionally caught in traps laid by local people for deer. Though this is no longer a major problem, the eagle&#x27;s numbers were also reduced by being captured for zoos. The diminishing numbers of the Philippine eagle were first brought to international attention in 1965 by the noted Filipino ornithologist Dioscoro S. Rabor, and the director of the Parks and Wildlife Office, Jesus A. Alvarez. Charles Lindbergh, best known for crossing the Atlantic alone and without stopping in 1927, was fascinated by this eagle. As a representative of the World Wildlife Fund, Lindbergh traveled to the Philippines several times between 1969 and 1972, where he helped persuade the government to protect the eagle. In 1969, the Monkey-eating Eagle Conservation Program was started to help preserve this species. In 1992, the first Philippine eagles were hatched in captivity through artificial insemination; however, the first naturally bred eaglet was not hatched until 1999. The first captive-bred bird to be released in the wild, Kabayan, was released in 2004 on Mindanao; however, he was accidentally electrocuted in January 2005. Another eagle, Kagsabua, was released in March 2008, but was shot and eaten by a farmer. In June 2015, an eagle was released after being treated for a gunshot wound; two months later it was shot and killed. Killing this critically endangered species is punishable under Philippine law by 12 years in jail and heavy fines.
Its numbers have slowly dwindled over the decades to the current population of 180 to 600 eagles. A series of floods and mud slides, caused by deforestation, further devastated the remaining population. The Philippine eagle may soon no longer be found in the wild, unless direct intervention is taken. The Philippine Eagle Foundation in Davao City, is one organization dedicated to the protection and conservation of the Philippine eagle and its forest habitat. The Philippine Eagle Foundation has successfully bred Philippine eagles in captivity for over a decade and conducted the first experimental release of a captive-bred eagle to the wild. As of 2025, The foundation has bred 30 eagles in captivity although, breeding has slowed in recent years in which the 28-30th chicks were bred in 2016, 2021 and 2024. Unfortunately, the 29th and 30th chicks were not able to make it to adulthood .

Ongoing research on behavior, ecology, and population dynamics is also underway. In recent years, protected lands have been established specifically for this species, such as the of Cabuaya Forest and the of Taft Forest Wildlife Sanctuary on Samar. However, a large proportion of the population is found on unprotected land.

===Reintroduction to Leyte===

In 2024, the Philippine Eagle Foundation decided to start a project which would involve the transplantation of Philippine eagles in Leyte where this species survives but may have been extriprated as the last records were prior to Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in 2013 which devastated the forests and have had no sightings since then. In June 2024, 2 rescued and non-paired eagles with tracking devices from Mindanao were released. They were released in hopes that they would form a pair but this project faced a significant setback when the male named &quot;Uswag&quot; was found dead at sea. Researchers believed that this eagle got blown off course and drowned at sea. As of October 2024, the female named &quot;Carlito&quot; was documented alive and is hunting and able to fend for itself..

===Philippine Eagle Diplomacy===

In a June 2019 wildlife loan agreement, a pair of Philippine eagles; (as of 2019) Geothermica, a 15 year old male and Sambisig (meaning one unity) a 17 year old female, were loaned to the Jurong Bird Park Singapore. This was part of conservation efforts for the species and also commemorated 50 years friendship between the Philippines and Singapore. Before the pair were shipped, they were given 2 specially printed passports dedicated to them. The pair were scheduled to stay at Singapore for 10 years as part of the agreement. The move marked the initiation of the government&#x27;s Philippine Eagle Diplomacy program. As of 2024, Geothermica had died from lung infection, his body now taxidermied at the National Museum, while Sambisig remained in Singapore at the new bird park that replaced Jurong. Despite this setback, Singapore Zoo and the Philippine Eagle Foundation maintain that this breeding program will continue and it will be likely that another possible mate for &quot;Sambisig&quot; will be loaned.

In August 2024, the Philippine Eagle Foundation launched the Philippine Eagle Geothermica&#x27;s Gateway Project facility as tribute to 19-year-old Geothermica, who died from an Aspergillus molds&#x27; fungal infection at the Bird Paradise, Mandai Wild Reserve in September 2022. His sculpture stands in the center of the new facility while his taxidermied body is currently displayed at the National Museum of the Philippines. The PEF partnered with Mandai Wildlife Group, United Architects of the Philippines-Davao City and Kublai Millan for the project.
==Representation==

The Philippine eagle was officially declared the national bird of the Philippines on July 4, 1995, by President Fidel V. Ramos under Proclamation No. 615, series of 1995. Due to the eagle&#x27;s size and rarity, it is also a coveted species for birdwatchers.

The Philippine eagle has been featured on at least 12 stamps from the Philippines, with dates ranging from 1967 to 2007. It was also depicted on the 50-sentimo coins minted from 1983 to 1994; in 2018, on the 500-Piso commemorative silver coin, to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas; on January 18, 2021, and on the 5,000-Piso Lapulapu commemorative non-circulating banknote. On December 11, 2021, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas unveiled the design of the new 1,000-Piso polymer banknote featuring the bird as the main portrait, controversially replacing those of three World War II martyrs: Chief Justice José Abad Santos, suffragist Josefa Llanes Escoda, and General Vicente Lim.

Historically, about 50 Philippine eagles have been kept in zoos in Europe (England, Germany, Belgium, Italy and France), the United States, and Japan. The first was a female that arrived in London Zoo in August 1909 and died there in February 1910. The majority arrived in zoos between 1947 and 1965. The last outside the Philippines died in 1988 in the Antwerp Zoo, where it had lived since 1964 (except for a period at the Planckendael Zoo in Belgium). 

The first captive breeding was only achieved in 1992 at the facility of the Philippine Eagle Foundation in Davao City, Philippines, which has bred it 30 times as of 2025.

The Philippine eagle is also used in sporting events as a mascot, most notably one in the 2005 Southeast Asian Games held in Manila known as &quot;Gilas&quot;. The Philippine eagle is also the animal used in the Philippines men&#x27;s national basketball team or Gilas Pilipinas&#x27; logo/team crest.

<text>The Château de Chambord () in Chambord, Centre-Val de Loire, France, is one of the most recognisable châteaux in the world because of its very distinctive French Renaissance architecture, which blends traditional French medieval forms with classical Renaissance structures. The building was constructed by the king of France, Francis I.

Chambord is the largest château in the Loire Valley; it was built to serve as a hunting lodge for Francis I, who maintained his royal residences at the Château de Blois and Amboise. The original design of the château is attributed to the Tuscan architect Domenico da Cortona; Leonardo da Vinci may have also influenced the design.

Chambord was altered considerably during the 28 years of its construction (1519–1547), during which it was overseen on-site by Pierre Neveu. With the château nearing completion, Francis showed off his enormous symbol of wealth and power by hosting his old archrival, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, at Chambord.

In 1792, in the wake of the French Revolution, some of the furnishings were sold and timber removed. For a time the building was left abandoned, though in the 19th century some attempts were made at restoration. During the Second World War, art works from the collections of the Louvre and the Château de Compiègne were moved to the Château de Chambord. The château is now open to the public, receiving 700,000 visitors in 2007. Flooding in June 2016 damaged the grounds but not the château itself.

==Architecture==
Châteaux in the 16th century departed from castle architecture. Indeed, while they were off-shoots of castles, with features commonly associated with them, they did not have serious defences. Extensive gardens and water features, such as a moat, were common amongst châteaux from this period. Chambord is no exception to this pattern. The layout is reminiscent of a typical castle with a keep, corner towers, and defended by a moat. Built in Renaissance style, the internal layout is an early example of the French and Italian style of grouping rooms into self-contained suites, a departure from the medieval style of corridor rooms. The massive château is composed of a central keep with four immense bastion towers at the corners. The keep also forms part of the front wall of a larger compound with two larger towers. Bases for a possible further two towers are found at the rear, but these were never developed, and remain the same height as the wall. The château features 440 rooms, 282 fireplaces, and 84 staircases. Four rectangular vaulted hallways on each floor form a cross-shape.

The castle was never intended to provide any form of defence from enemies; consequently the walls, towers and partial moat are decorative, and even at the time were an anachronism. Some elements of architecture—open windows, loggias, and a vast outdoor area at the top—borrowed from the Italian Renaissance architecture—are less practical in cold and damp northern France.

The roofscape of Chambord contrasts with the masses of its masonry and has often been compared with the skyline of a town: it shows 11 kinds of towers and three types of chimneys, without symmetry, framed at the corners by the massive towers. The design parallels are north Italian and Leonardesque. Writer Henry James remarked, &quot;the towers, cupolas, the gables, the lanterns, the chimneys, look more like the spires of a city than the salient points of a single building.&quot;

One of the architectural highlights is the spectacular open double-spiral staircase that is the centrepiece of the château. The two spirals ascend the three floors without ever meeting, illuminated from above by a sort of light house at the highest point of the château. There are suggestions that Leonardo da Vinci may have designed the staircase, but this has not been confirmed. Writer John Evelyn said of the staircase, &quot;it is devised with four [sic] entries or ascents, which cross one another, so that though four persons meet, they never come in sight, but by small loopholes, till they land. It consists of 274 steps (as I remember), and is an extraordinary work, but of far greater expense than use or beauty.&quot;

The château also features of façade, more than 800 sculpted columns and an elaborately decorated roof. When Francis I commissioned the construction of Chambord, he wanted it to look like the skyline of Constantinople.

The château is surrounded by a wooded park and game reserve maintained with red deer, enclosed by a wall. The king&#x27;s plan to divert the Loire to surround the château came about only in a novel; &quot;Amadís de Gaula&quot;, which Francis had translated. In the novel the château is referred to as the &quot;Palace of Firm Isle&quot;.

Chambord&#x27;s towers are atypical of French contemporary design in that they lack turrets and spires. In the opinion of author Tanaka Hidemichi, who suggests Leonardo da Vinci influenced the château&#x27;s design, they are closer in design to minarets of 15th-century Milan.

==History==

===Royal ownership===
Who designed the Château de Chambord is a matter of controversy. The original design is attributed, though with several doubts, to Domenico da Cortona, whose wooden model for the design survived long enough to be drawn by André Félibien in the 17th century. In the drawings of the model, the main staircase of the keep is shown with two straight, parallel flights of steps separated by a passage and is located in one of the arms of the cross. According to Jean-Guillaume, this Italian design was later replaced with the centrally located spiral staircase, which is similar to that at Blois, and a design more compatible with the French preference for spectacular grand staircases. However, &quot;at the same time the result was also a triumph of the centralised layout—itself a wholly Italian element.&quot; In 1913 Marcel Reymond suggested that Leonardo da Vinci, a guest of Francis at Clos Lucé near Amboise, was responsible for the original design, which reflects Leonardo&#x27;s plans for a château at Romorantin for the King&#x27;s mother, and his interests in central planning and double-spiral staircases; the discussion has not yet concluded, although many scholars now agree that Leonardo was at least responsible for the design of the central staircase.

Archaeological findings by Jean-Sylvain Caillou &amp; Dominic Hofbauer have established that the lack of symmetry of some façades derives from an original design, abandoned shortly after the construction began, and which ground plan was organised around the central staircase following a central gyratory symmetry. Such a rotative design has no equivalent in architecture at this period of history, and appears reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s works on hydraulic turbines or the helicopter. Had it been respected, it is believed that this unique building could have featured the quadruple-spiral open staircase, strangely described by John Evelyn and Andrea Palladio, although it was never built.

Regardless of who designed the château, on 6 September 1519 Francis de Pontbriand was ordered to begin construction of the Château de Chambord. The work was interrupted by the Italian War of 1521–1526, and work was slowed by dwindling royal funds and difficulties in laying the structure&#x27;s foundations. By 1524, the walls were barely above ground level. Building resumed in September 1526, at which point 1,800 workers were employed in building the château. At the time of the death of King Francis I in 1547, the work had cost 444,070 &quot;livres&quot;.
The château was built to act as a hunting lodge for King Francis I; however, the King spent barely seven weeks there in total, that time consisting of short hunting visits. As the château had been constructed with the purpose of short stays, it was not practical to live in on a longer-term basis. The massive rooms, open windows and high ceilings meant heating was impractical. Similarly, as the château was not surrounded by a village or estate, there was no immediate source of food other than game. This meant that all food had to be brought with the group, typically numbering up to 2,000 people at a time.

As a result of all the above, the château was completely unfurnished during this period. All furniture, wall coverings, eating implements and so forth were brought specifically for each hunting trip, a major logistical exercise. It is for this reason that much furniture from the era was built to be disassembled to facilitate transportation. After Francis died of a heart attack in 1547, the château was not used for almost a century.

For more than 80 years after the death of King Francis I, French kings abandoned the château, allowing it to fall into decay. Finally, in 1639 King Louis XIII gave it to his brother, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who saved the château from ruin by carrying out much restoration work.

King Louis XIV had the great keep restored and furnished the royal apartments. The king then added a 1,200-horse stable, enabling him to use the château as a hunting lodge and a place to entertain for a few weeks each year, for example Molière presented the premiere of his celebrated comedy, &quot;Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme&quot; here. Nonetheless, Louis XIV abandoned the château in 1685.

From 1725 to 1733, Stanisław Leszczyński (Stanislas I), the deposed King of Poland and the father-in-law of King Louis XV, lived at Chambord. In 1745, as a reward for valour, the king gave the château to Maurice de Saxe, Marshal of France, who installed his military regiment there. Maurice de Saxe died in 1750, and once again the colossal château sat empty for many years.

===French Revolution and modern history===

In 1792, the Revolutionary government ordered the sale of the furnishings; the wall panellings were removed and even floors were taken up and sold for the value of their timber, and, according to M de la Saussaye, the panelled doors were burned to keep the rooms warm during the sales; the empty château was left abandoned until Napoleon Bonaparte gave it to his subordinate, Louis Alexandre Berthier. The château was subsequently purchased from his widow for the infant Duke of Bordeaux, Henry Charles (1820–1883) who took the title Count of Chambord. A brief attempt at restoration and occupation was made by his grandfather King Charles X (1824–1830) but in 1830 both were exiled. In &quot;Outre-Mer: A Pilgrimage Beyond the Sea&quot;, published in the 1830s, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow remarked on the dilapidation that had set in: &quot;all is mournful and deserted. The grass has overgrown the pavement of the courtyard, and the rude sculpture upon the walls is broken and defaced&quot;. During the Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871) the château was used as a field hospital.

The final attempt to make use of the colossus came from the Count of Chambord, but after the Count died in 1883, the château was left to his sister&#x27;s heirs, the titular Dukes of Parma, then resident in Austria-Hungary; firstly Robert, Duke of Parma, who died in 1907 and after him, Elias, Prince of Parma. Any attempts at restoration ended with the onset of World War I in 1914. The Château de Chambord was confiscated as enemy property in 1915, but the family of the duke of Parma sued to recover it, and that suit was not settled until 1932; restoration work was not begun until a few years after World War II ended in 1945. The Château and surrounding areas, some , have belonged to the French state since 1930.
In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the art collections of the Louvre and Compiègne museums (including the Mona Lisa) were stored at the Château de Chambord. An American B-24 Liberator bomber crashed onto the château lawn on 22 June 1944. The image of the château has been widely used to sell commodities from chocolate to alcohol and from porcelain to alarm clocks; combined with the various written accounts of visitors, this made Chambord one of the best known examples of France&#x27;s architectural history. Today, Chambord is a major tourist attraction, and in 2007 around 700,000 people visited the château.

After unusually heavy rainfall, Chambord was closed to the public from 1 to 6 June 2016. The River Cosson, a tributary of the Loire, flooded its banks and the château&#x27;s moat. Drone photography documented some of the peak flooding. The described effects of the flooding on Chambord&#x27;s property. The wall around the château was breached at several points, metal gates were torn from their framing, and roads were damaged. Trees were also uprooted and certain electrical and fire protection systems were put out of order. However, the château itself and its collections reportedly were undamaged. The foundation observed that paradoxically the natural disaster effected Francis I&#x27;s vision that Chambord appears to rise from the waters as if it were diverting the Loire. Repairs are expected to cost upwards of a quarter-million dollars.
==Influence==

The Château de Chambord has further influenced a number of architectural and decorative elements across Europe. Château de Chambord was the model for the reconstruction and new construction of the original Schwerin Palace between 1845 and 1857.

Yet in the later half of the 19th century, the château&#x27;s style proliferated across the United Kingdom, influencing the Founder&#x27;s Building at Royal Holloway, University of London, designed by William Henry Crossland and the main building of Fettes College in Edinburgh, designed by David Bryce in 1870. Between 1874 and 1889, the country house in Buckinghamshire, Waddesdon Manor, was built with similar architectural frameworks as the Château de Chambord, disseminated via the architect Gabriel-Hippolyte Destailleur. For instance, the twin staircase towers, on the north façade, were inspired by the staircase tower at the château. However, following the theme of unparalleled luxury at Waddesdon, the windows of the towers at Waddesdon were glazed, unlike those of the staircase at Chambord, and were far more ornate.
