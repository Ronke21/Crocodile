<text>Yonne (, in Burgundian: &quot;Ghienne&quot;) is a département in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region in France. It is named after the river Yonne, which flows through it, in the country&#x27;s north-central part. One of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté&#x27;s eight constituent departments, it is located in its northwestern part, bordering Île-de-France. It was created in 1790 during the French Revolution. Its prefecture is Auxerre, with subprefectures in Avallon and Sens. Its INSEE and postcode number is 89.

Yonne is Bourgogne-Franche-Comté&#x27;s fourth-most populous department, with a population of 335,707 (2019). Its largest city is its prefecture Auxerre, with a population of about 35,000 within city limits and 68,000 in the urban area.

==History==
The first evidence of occupation in this area is found in the Grottes d&#x27;Arcy-sur-Cure, where paintings have been found dating back 28,000 years. The Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers of that time also left behind numerous flint artefacts. The area is believed to have been occupied for about 200,000 years. By 4000 BC, a wave of Neolithics arrived from the Danube River region of eastern Europe. They built substantial wooden houses and introduced pottery decorated with the characteristics of the Linear Pottery culture. Further waves of migrants followed, the Chasséen culture, and the Michelsberg culture.

The Celtic tribe in the area were named &quot;Icauna&quot;, after the River Yonne which they thought sacred. The region was later occupied by Gallic tribes. In that period, the area came under the control of the Roman Empire, whose chief town was Sens, which they called Agendicum. It was the capital of their province of Gallia Lugdunensis, one of four provinces into which France was divided. The present main roads from Lyon to Boulogne, and from Sens to Alise-Sainte-Reine date from this period. About this time, Auxerre, Tonnerre (Tornodurum) and Avallon were growing in size. In the fourth century, Sens became a walled city. The first bishops were appointed in Sens and Langres, and they influenced the region profoundly because of their power.

In 1771, the north-westerly part of the present department belonged to Prince Francis Xavier of Saxony, the uncle of Louis XVI of France. The current Yonne department was organized and defined during the French Revolution, on March 4, 1790, as a result of the passing of an Act on December 22, 1789. It was carved out of parts of the provinces of Burgundy, Champagne and Orléans, and to a lesser extent from parts of the Nivernais and Île-de-France.

==Geography==

Yonne is a department in central France, one of the eight constituent departments of the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. To the northeast lies the department of Aube, to the east lies Côte-d&#x27;Or, to the south lies Nièvre, to the west lies Loiret and to the northwest, the department of Seine-et-Marne. The River Yonne flows northwards through the department. Auxerre, the capital of the department, is situated on the River Yonne, and the River Serein joins this a few kilometres north of the city. The Canal de Bourgogne, which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean, joins the River Yonne through locks at Migennes a little further north. The second biggest town is Sens, situated at the confluence of the rivers Vanne and Yonne.

The geology of the department is complex with concentric rings of granite, Jurassic, Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks, and layers of sedimentary rocks. The terrain is mostly a low-lying plateau used for agriculture. The southwestern part is the Puisaye, which has a higher elevation and is more wooded. To the centre and east, the land inclines to the northwest where the higher land of the Tonnerrois region lies. To the east the rock is mostly limestone. The Auxerrois region is renowned for the grapes grown here, which are used in the production of Chablis wine. To the south lies the mountainous massif of Morvan, the highest parts of which are in the neighbouring department of Nièvre. The department has some forested areas but is mainly used for pasture or cultivated for wheat.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Auxerre, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 5,000 inhabitants:

== Demographics ==
Population development since 1801:

==Economy==
Over fifty percent of the inhabitants of the department are engaged in agricultural activities. Yonne is one of the poorest and most rural departments in France. During the hundred years leading up to 1962, its population declined by around 100,000, while all of the surrounding departments experienced population growth. Yonne had been bypassed by the development of the railways. As French industry flourished elsewhere in the late nineteenth century, the young people left Yonne seeking better opportunities, and the department stagnated.

The viticulture industry was severely affected by the advent of powdery mildew and the arrival of &quot;Phylloxera&quot; in the nineteenth century; at the same time, the development of the railway network allowed cheaper wines from other regions to undercut Chablis wine in the Paris market. The once-thriving industry never recovered. By 1945, only 4000 hectares of grapevines remained, and only 471 hectares of grapes were grown for Chablis.

More recently, the population trend has been reversed. During the period 1999 to 2007, it rose by 8000 to a total of 341,418. However, with a population of 46 inhabitants per square kilometre, the density in Yonne is still less than half that for the whole of France, which was 100.5 for the same year.

==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Patrick Gendraud, elected in 2017. In 2015, the General Council of the department was allotted a budget of 410 million euros.

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

The department elects three members of parliament to the National Assembly. In the 2012–17 parliamentary term, two represented the right-wing Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and one the Socialist Party (France) (PS).

<text>Essonne () is a department in the southern part of the Île-de-France region in Northern France. It is named after the river Essonne. In 2019, it had a population of 1,301,659, across 194 communes.

Essonne was formed on 1 January 1968, when Seine-et-Oise was split into smaller departments. Its prefecture is Évry-Courcouronnes. Its INSEE and postcode number is 91.

== History ==
The Essonne department was created on 1 January 1968, from the southern portion of the former department of Seine-et-Oise.

In June 1963, Carrefour S.A. opened the first hypermarket in the Paris region at Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois (although the word &quot;hypermarché&quot; was first used only in 1966). Based on the ideas put forward by the American logistics pioneer Bernardo Trujillo, the centre offered on a single site a hitherto unknown combination of wide choice and low prices, supported by 400 car parking spaces.

In 1969, the communes of Châteaufort and Toussus-le-Noble were separated from Essonne and added to the department of Yvelines.

== Geography ==
Essonne belongs to the region of Île-de-France.

It has borders with the departments of:

Seine-Saint-Denis and two other small departments, and , form a ring around Paris, known as the (&quot;little crown&quot;). Since 1 January 2016, together with Paris, they have formed the area of Greater Paris (Grand Paris).

Until 2008, and were the only departments where the Communist Party had a majority in the general councils but the 2008 cantonal elections saw the socialists become the strongest group at the general council (while the Communist Party gained a majority in and lost it in 2015).

<text>Val-d&#x27;Oise (, &quot;Vale of the Oise&quot;) is a department in the Île-de-France region, Northern France. It was created in 1968 following the split of the Seine-et-Oise department. In 2019, Val-d&#x27;Oise had a population of 1,249,674.

It is named after the river Oise, a major tributary of the Seine, which crosses the region after having started in Belgium and flowed through Northeastern France. Val-d&#x27;Oise is Île-de-France&#x27;s northernmost department. Charles de Gaulle Airport, France&#x27;s main international airport, is partially located in Roissy-en-France, a commune of Val-d&#x27;Oise.

Its INSEE and postcode number is 95.

==History==
The original departments of France were established in 1790 when the French National Assembly split the country into 83 departments of roughly the same size and population. They were designed as sets of communes, and when better maps became available, certain revisions had to be made. 
In 1964, it was determined to divide up the departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise. Val-d&#x27;Oise was one of the new departments so formed, and was created entirely from the previous department of Seine-et-Oise.

==Geography==
Val-d&#x27;Oise is a department in north central France and is part of the region of Île-de-France. To the south of the department lies the department of Hauts-de-Seine, to the southwest lies Yvelines, to the west lies Eure, to the north lies Oise, to the east lies Seine-et-Marne and to the southeast lies Seine-Saint-Denis. The official &quot;préfecture&quot; (capital) of the department is the commune of Pontoise, situated in the suburbs of Paris some northwest of the centre of the city, but the &quot;préfecture&quot; building and administrative offices are in the neighbouring commune of Cergy. The River Oise is a right tributary of the River Seine, and flows through the province from northeast to southwest.

The eastern part of the department is part of the Pays de France, an area of fertile plain traditionally used for agriculture (particularly cereals and sugar beet) based on its fine silty soils. This part is progressively diminishing in size as Paris expands. Part of Charles de Gaulle Airport falls in this eastern region, while other parts are in the departments of Seine-et-Marne and Seine-Saint-Denis. The southernmost region of the department forms part of the Seine Valley and occupies the whole of the small Vallée de Montmorency. These parts are heavily urbanised, but the ancient Roman road, the Chaussée Jules César, which linked Paris and Rouen, passes through the latter. The central and southwestern parts of the department are also largely urbanised and part of the greater Paris sprawl. The western part of the department forms part of the historic county of Vexin français, a verdant, largely agricultural plateau. Its capital was Pontoise on the eastern extremity of the county. This commune is now combining with the neighbouring commune of Cergy to form the new town of Cergy-Pontoise. The Vexin area remains largely rural, and across the whole department, one fifth is covered with trees.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Argenteuil; the prefecture Pontoise is the sixth-most populous. As of 2019, the 10 most populous communes are:

==Economy==
The economy of Val-d&#x27;Oise relies on two different themes. The northern, eastern and western parts are fertile areas of agricultural land producing large quantities of corn, sugar beet, and other crops. The urban parts to the south are dormitory towns, used by people working in the greater metropolitan area of Paris. The presence of Charles de Gaulle Airport and its associated TGV station provides access by rail to all parts of France. The department has nine business zones designated for high-tech industries.

===Place of birth of residents===
==Politics==

The president of the Departmental Council is Marie-Christine Cavecchi, elected in 2017.

=== Presidential elections 2nd round ===

==Tourism==
The department has a rich archaeological and historical heritage, but is not a region visited much by tourists, perhaps being overshadowed by the French capital. Places of interest include the following sites; La Roche-Guyon with a castle on top of a rocky hill and a twelfth century château; L&#x27;Isle-Adam, a historic small town on the bank of the River Oise; Auvers-sur-Oise, which owes its international fame to its landscapes and the impressionist painters such as Charles-François Daubigny, Paul Cézanne, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Camille Pissarro and Vincent van Gogh who immortalised them; Enghien-les-Bains, a spa resort with a hot, sulphurous spring, on the site of what was originally Lake Enghien; Écouen with a fine château which houses the Museum of the Renaissance; Cergy-Pontoise, the new administrative capital which has been created out of thirteen communes and has quadrupled in population since the 1960s. There is a branch of the Académie de Versailles in the city which provides tertiary education; Théméricourt, where as well as a fine château, there is the historic church of Notre-Dame, and the twelfth or thirteenth century Croix de l&#x27;Ormeteau-Marie. Royaumont Abbey, founded by St. Louis in the thirteenth century, is another important site. There are two protected nature areas in the department: the Parc naturel régional du Vexin français and the Parc naturel régional Oise-Pays de France.

Argenteuil is a sub-prefecture and is the second most populous of Paris&#x27; suburbs. It is in a scenic location by the River Seine and has been much-painted by Claude Monet, Eugène Delacroix, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Alfred Sisley and Georges Braque. It has several historic buildings and a local museum.

<text>Papa Legba is a lwa, or loa, in West African Vodun and its diasporic derivatives (Dominican Republic Vudú, Haitian Vodou, Louisiana Voodoo, and Winti), who serves as the intermediary between God and humanity. He stands at a spiritual crossroads and gives (or denies) permission to speak with the spirits of Guineé, and is believed to speak all human languages. In Haiti, he is the great elocutioner. Legba facilitates communication, speech, and understanding. He is commonly associated with dogs. Papa Legba is invoked at the beginning of every ceremony. Papa Legba has his origins in the historic West African kingdom of Dahomey, located within present-day Benin.

==Appearance==
He usually appears as an old man on a crutch or with a cane, wearing a broad-brimmed straw hat and smoking a pipe, or drinking dark rum. The dog is sacred to him. Legba is syncretized with Saint Peter, Saint Lazarus, and Saint Anthony. His &quot;veve&quot; incorporates a walking cane on the right side. Offerings to him typically include candy.

Legba is a favorite lwa of children due to his jolly, grandpa-like image. He is often tasked with babysitting and distracting children (a typical male role in the matrilineal religion) while more serious rituals are being performed by the adults.

==In popular culture==
In his study of the Delta blues, Robert Palmer discusses the appearance of Legba in blues lyrics and lore. Palmer notes that Legba can be referred to/identified as &quot;the Devil&quot;, &quot;Papa Legba&quot;, and &quot;The Black Man&quot; throughout the history of the blues. This is also made clear in ethnomusicologist Bruno Blum&#x27;s text for the CD box set &quot;Voodoo in America&quot; where reference to Papa Legba, deity of roads and crossroads, in Robert Johnson&#x27;s iconic song &quot;Crossroads&quot; is explained.

There is extensive referencing to voodoo in the Sprawl trilogy (1984-1988) by William Gibson. In the second book, &quot;Count Zero&quot; (1986), Papa Legba stands at the gateway to cyberspace as the &quot;master of roads and pathways,&quot; with other loa appearing throughout the book. Papa Legba and Voodoo appear again in &quot;Spook Country&quot; (2007), a book from one of Gibson&#x27;s other trilogies.

A 1985 episode of the TV series &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (Season 2, Episode 8, &quot;Tale of the Goat&quot;) centers on a malign Vodou priest by the name of Papa Legba (played by Clarence Williams III). In keeping with the image of Legba often conceptualised in Haitian Vodou subculture, Papa Legba is depicted as &quot;controlling&quot; the gateway to the spiritual world (through the use of drugs), walking with the aid of crutches, and smoking a pipe.

The musical group Talking Heads made a song named after him. The song can be found on their 1986 album (and soundtrack to the David Byrne film of the same name), &quot;True Stories&quot;. In the film, this song is sung by Pops Staples, whose character performs a kind of love ritual. The Danish band Volbeat features what appears to be a cartoon interpretation of Papa Legba in their 2017 animated video for &quot;The Black Rose.&quot;

Papa Legba is a recurring character in &quot;American Horror Story&quot;, appearing in the third and eighth season, as a gatekeeper of the afterlife. He is an acquaintance of Marie Laveau, having granted her immortality in exchange for the offering of one innocent every year. Papa Legba’s portrayal in the show has attracted some criticism, with many noting that the portrayal of Papa Legba was more similar to Baron Samedi than the mythical Papa Legba himself.

In the 2024 Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Movies (SPUMM) film Kraven the Hunter, the titular protagonist (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) develops supernatural abilities after receiving a potion allegedly derived from the traditional spiritual scholarship of Papa Legba by the grandmother of the film&#x27;s primary female protagonist, Calypso (Ariana DeBose).

<doc id="90625" wikidata="Q5676" url="?curid=90625" title="Matsuo Bashō">
<text>; born Matsuo Kinsaku (), later known as Matsuo Chūemon Munefusa () was the most famous Japanese poet of the Edo period. During his lifetime, Bashō was recognized for his works in the collaborative &quot;haikai no renga&quot; form; today, after centuries of commentary, he is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called hokku). He is also well known for his travel essays beginning with &quot;Records of a Weather-Exposed Skeleton&quot; (1684), written after his journey west to Kyoto and Nara. Matsuo Bashō&#x27;s poetry is internationally renowned, and, in Japan, many of his poems are reproduced on monuments and traditional sites. Although Bashō is famous in the West for his hokku, he himself believed his best work lay in leading and participating in renku. As he himself said, &quot;Many of my followers can write hokku as well as I can. Where I show who I really am is in linking haikai verses.&quot;

Bashō was introduced to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made a living as a teacher; but then renounced the social, urban life of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Matsuo Bashō was born in 1644, near Ueno, in Iga Province. The Matsuo family was of samurai descent, and his father was probably a , a class of landowning peasants granted certain privileges of samurai.

Little is known of his childhood. The Matsuo were a major ninja family, and Bashō was trained in ninjutsu. In his late teens, Bashō became a servant to most likely in some humble capacity, and probably not promoted to full samurai class. It is claimed he served as cook or a kitchen worker in some near-contemporaneous accounts, but there is no conclusive proof. A later hypothesis is that he was chosen to serve as page () to Yoshitada, with alternative documentary evidence suggesting he started serving at a younger age.

He shared Yoshitada&#x27;s love for &quot;haikai no renga&quot;, a form of collaborative poetry composition. A sequence was opened with a verse in 5-7-5 mora format; this verse was named a &quot;hokku&quot;, and would centuries later be renamed &quot;haiku&quot; when presented as a stand-alone work. The &quot;hokku&quot; would be followed by a related 7-7 mora verse by another poet. Both Bashō and Yoshitada gave themselves , or &quot;haikai&quot; pen names; Bashō&#x27;s was , which was simply the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; (Sino-Japanese reading) of his adult name, &quot;.&quot; In 1662, the first extant poem by Bashō was published. In 1726, two of Bashō&#x27;s hokku were printed in a compilation.

In 1665, Bashō and Yoshitada together with some acquaintances composed a hyakuin, or one-hundred-verse &quot;renku&quot;. In 1666, Yoshitada&#x27;s sudden death brought Bashō&#x27;s peaceful life as a servant to an end. No records of this time remain, but it is believed that Bashō gave up any possibility of samurai status and left home. Biographers have proposed various reasons and destinations, including the possibility of an affair between Bashō and a Shinto &quot;miko&quot; named , which is unlikely to be true. Bashō&#x27;s own references to this time are vague; he recalled that &quot;at one time I coveted an official post with a tenure of land&quot;, and that &quot;there was a time when I was fascinated with the ways of homosexual love&quot;: there is no indication whether he was referring to real obsessions or fictional ones. (Biographers of the author, however, note that Bashō was involved in homosexual affairs throughout all his life and that among his lovers were several of his disciples; in Professor Gary Leupp&#x27;s view, Bashō&#x27;s homoerotic compositions were clearly based on his personal experiences). He was uncertain whether to become a full-time poet; by his own account, &quot;the alternatives battled in my mind and made my life restless&quot;. His indecision may have been influenced by the then still relatively low status of &quot;renga&quot; and &quot;haikai no renga&quot; as more social activities than serious artistic endeavors. In any case, his poems continued to be published in anthologies in 1667, 1669, and 1671, and he published a compilation of work by himself and other authors of the Teitoku school, , in 1672. In about the spring of that year he moved to Edo, to further his study of poetry.

===Rise to fame===

In the fashionable literary circles of Nihonbashi, Bashō&#x27;s poetry was quickly recognized for its simple and natural style. In 1674 he was inducted into the inner circle of the &quot;haikai&quot; profession, receiving secret teachings from Kitamura Kigin (1624–1705). He wrote this &quot;hokku&quot; in mock tribute to the &quot;shōgun&quot;:

When Nishiyama Sōin, founder and leader of the Danrin school of haikai, came to Edo from Osaka in 1675, Bashō was among the poets invited to compose with him. It was on this occasion that he gave himself the &quot;&quot; of Tōsei, and by 1680 he had a full-time job teaching twenty disciples, who published , advertising their connection to Tōsei&#x27;s talent. That winter, he took the surprising step of moving across the river to Fukagawa, out of the public eye and towards a more reclusive life. His disciples built him a rustic hut and planted a in the yard, giving Bashō a new &quot;haigō&quot; and his first permanent home. He appreciated the plant very much, but was not happy to see Fukagawa&#x27;s native miscanthus grass growing alongside it:

Despite his success, Bashō grew dissatisfied and lonely. He began to practice Zen meditation, but it seems not to have calmed his mind. In the winter of 1682 his hut burned down, and shortly afterwards, in early 1683, his mother died. He then traveled to Yamura, to stay with a friend. In the winter of 1683 his disciples gave him a second hut in Edo, but his spirits did not improve. In 1684 his disciple Takarai Kikaku published a compilation of him and other poets, . Later that year he left Edo on the first of four major wanderings.

Bashō traveled alone, off the beaten path, that is, on the Edo Five Routes, which in medieval Japan were regarded as immensely dangerous; and, at first Bashō expected to simply die in the middle of nowhere or be killed by bandits. However, as his trip progressed, his mood improved, and he became comfortable on the road. Bashō met many friends and grew to enjoy the changing scenery and the seasons. His poems took on a less introspective and more striking tone as he observed the world around him:

The trip took him from Edo to Mount Fuji, Ueno, and Kyoto. He met several poets who called themselves his disciples and wanted his advice; he told them to disregard the contemporary Edo style and even his own &quot;Shriveled Chestnuts&quot;, saying it contained &quot;many verses that are not worth discussing&quot;. Bashō returned to Edo in the summer of 1685, taking time along the way to write more &quot;hokku&quot; and comment on his own life:

When Bashō returned to Edo he happily resumed his job as a teacher of poetry at his &quot;bashō&quot; hut, although privately he was already making plans for another journey. The poems from his journey were published as &quot;Nozarashi Kikō&quot; (野ざらし紀行).

In early 1686, Bashō composed one of his best-remembered haiku:

This poem became instantly famous. In April, the poets of Edo gathered at the &quot;bashō&quot; hut for a &quot;haikai no renga&quot; contest on the subject of frogs that seems to have been a tribute to Bashō&#x27;s &quot;hokku&quot;, which was placed at the top of the compilation. For the rest of the year, Bashō stayed in Edo, continuing to teach and hold contests.

In the autumn of 1687 he journeyed to the countryside for moon watching, and made a longer trip in 1688 when he returned to Ueno to celebrate the Lunar New Year. Back home in Edo, Bashō sometimes became reclusive: alternating between rejecting visitors to his hut and appreciating their company. At the same time, he retained a subtle sense of humor, as reflected in his &quot;hokku&quot;:

=== &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; ===


Bashō&#x27;s private planning for another long journey, to be described in his masterwork &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot;, or &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot;, culminated on May 16, 1689 (Yayoi 27, Genroku 2), when he left Edo with his student and apprentice on a journey to the Northern Provinces of Honshū. Bashō and Sora headed north to Hiraizumi, which they reached on June 29. They then walked to the western side of the island, touring Kisakata on , and began hiking back at a leisurely pace along the coastline. During this 150-day journey Bashō traveled a total of 600 &quot;ri&quot; (2,400 km) through the northeastern areas of Honshū, returning to Edo in late 1691.

By the time Bashō reached Ōgaki, Gifu Prefecture, he had completed the log of his journey. He edited and redacted it for three years, writing the final version in 1694 as . The first edition was published posthumously in 1702. It was an immediate commercial success and many other itinerant poets followed the path of his journey. It is often considered his finest achievement, featuring &quot;hokku&quot; such as:

=== Last years ===

On his return to Edo in the winter of 1691, Bashō lived in his third &quot;bashō&quot; hut, again provided by his disciples. This time, he was not alone; he took in his nephew Toin and a female friend Jutei, who were both recovering from illness. He had many great visitors.

Bashō wrote to a friend that &quot;disturbed by others, I have no peace of mind&quot;. Until late August 1693, he continued to make a living from teaching and appearances at &quot;haikai&quot; parties. Then he shut the gate to his &quot;bashō&quot; hut and refused to see anybody for a month. Finally, he relented after adopting the principle of &quot;karumi&quot; or &quot;lightness&quot;, a semi-Buddhist philosophy of greeting the mundane world rather than separating from it.

Bashō left Edo for the last time in the summer of 1694, spending time in Ueno and Kyoto before arriving in Osaka. There, he came down with a stomach illness and surrounded by his disciples, died peacefully. Although he did not compose a formal death poem, the following is generally accepted as his poem of farewell:

== Influence and literary criticism ==
===Early centuries===

Rather than sticking to the formulas of , which remain popular in Japan even today, Bashō aspired to reflect his real environment and emotions in his &quot;hokku&quot;. Even during his lifetime, the effort and style of his poetry was widely appreciated; after his death, it only increased. Several of his students compiled quotations from him about his own poetry, most notably Mukai Kyorai and Hattori Dohō.

During the 18th century, appreciation of Bashō&#x27;s poems grew more fervent, and commentators such as Ishiko Sekisui and Moro Nanimaru went to great length to find references in his &quot;hokku&quot; to historical events, medieval books, and other poems. These commentators were often lavish in their praise of Bashō&#x27;s obscure references, some of which were probably literary false cognates. In 1793 Bashō was deified by the Shinto bureaucracy, and for a time criticizing his poetry was literally blasphemous.

In the late 19th century, this period of unanimous passion for Bashō&#x27;s poems came to an end. Masaoka Shiki, arguably Bashō&#x27;s most famous critic, tore down the long-standing orthodoxy with his bold and candid objections to Bashō&#x27;s style. However, Shiki was also instrumental in making Bashō&#x27;s poetry accessible in English, and to leading intellectuals and the Japanese public at large. He invented the term &quot;haiku&quot; (replacing &quot;hokku&quot;) to refer to the freestanding 5–7–5 form which he considered the most artistic and desirable part of the &quot;haikai no renga&quot;.

Basho was illustrated in one of Tsukioka Yoshitoshi&#x27;s ukiyo-e woodblock prints from the &quot;One Hundred Aspects of the Moon&quot; collection, c. 1885-1892. His Bunkyō hermitage was illustrated by Hiroshige in the &quot;One Hundred Famous Views of Edo&quot; collection, published around 1857.

===20th century-present===

Critical interpretation of Bashō&#x27;s poems continued into the 20th century, with notable works by Yamamoto Kenkichi, Imoto Nōichi, and Ogata Tsutomu. The 20th century also saw translations of Bashō&#x27;s poems into other languages around the world. The position of Bashō in Western eyes as the &quot;haiku&quot; poet &quot;par excellence&quot; gives great influence to his poetry: Western preference for &quot;haiku&quot; over more traditional forms such as &quot;tanka&quot; or &quot;renga&quot; have rendered archetypal status to Bashō as Japanese poet and &quot;haiku&quot; as Japanese poetry. Some western scholars even believe that Bashō invented haiku. The impressionistic and concise nature of Bashō&#x27;s verse greatly influenced Ezra Pound, the Imagists, and poets of the Beat Generation.

On this question, Jaime Lorente maintains in his research work &quot;Bashō y el metro 5-7-5&quot; that of the 1012 hokkus analyzed by master Bashō 145 cannot fit into the 5-7-5 meter, since they are a broken meter (specifically, they present a greater number of mora [syllables]). In percentage they represent 15% of the total. Even establishing 50 poems that, presenting this 5-7-5 pattern, could be framed in another structure (due to the placement of the particle &quot;ya&quot;), the figure is similar. Therefore, Lorente concludes that the teacher was close to the traditional pattern.

In 1942, the Haiseiden building was constructed in Iga, Mie, to commemorate the 300th anniversary of Basho&#x27;s birth. Featuring a circular roof named the &quot;traveler&#x27;s umbrella&quot;, the building was made to resemble Basho&#x27;s face and clothing.

Two of Bashō&#x27;s poems were popularized in the short story &quot;Teddy&quot; written by J. D. Salinger and published in 1952 by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine.

In 1979, the International Astronomical Union named a crater found on Mercury after him.

In 2003, an international anthology film titled &quot;Winter Days&quot; adapted Basho&#x27;s 1684 &quot;renku&quot; collection of the same name into a series of animations. Animators include Kihachirō Kawamoto, Yuri Norstein, and Isao Takahata.

<text>Maman Brigitte (English: &quot;Mother Brigitte&quot;) sometimes also written as Manman Brigitte and also known by Gran Brigitte, Grann Brigitte, Manman, Manman Brigit, and Maman Brijit is a death loa (or &quot;lwa&quot;) and the consort of Baron Samedi in Haitian Vodou. She drinks rum infused with hot peppers and is symbolized by a black rooster. Maman Brigitte protects graves in Haitian cemeteries that are marked by the cross of Baron Samedi. Graves that are protected by Brigitte are marked by a mound of stones. In Vodou practice, the first burials serve as offerings to either Baron Samedi or Maman Brigitte depending on the sex of the person being buried: if male, the grave is dedicated to Baron Samedi; if female to Maman Brigitte.

Like Samedi and the Guede, she is foul-mouthed. She is also the adoptive mother of Guede Nibo.

Due to the religious persecution of enslaved African and Caribbean people in Haiti and the Americas, Maman Brigitte was disguised via syncretism and represented by various saints, usually those depicted with fire or snakes, including Brigid of Kildare and, less frequently, Mary Magdalene.

== In other media ==

=== Literature ===

* In the 1988 cyberpunk novel Mona Lisa Overdrive, one of the AIs inhabiting cyberspace puts on the persona of Maman Brigitte to communicate with human characters.

=== Video games ===

* In the game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077,&quot; there is a character named Maman Brigitte who comes from Haiti that leads the gang, the Voodoo Boys.
* Maman Brigitte appears as a playable character in the 2014 multiplayer online battle arena &quot;Smite&quot;, alongside her husband Baron Samedi. She is the second playable Voodoo Lwa.

=== Art ===

* Haitian artists such as Andre Pierre and Gerard Paul painted representations of Brigitte in their artwork, which was informed by Haitian Vodou.
===Television===

* In season 2, episode 5 of &quot;American Gods (TV series),&quot; Maman Brigitte is portrayed by &quot;Hani Furstenberg&quot; as the lover of &quot;Baron Samedi&quot; (portrayed by &quot;Mustafa Shakir&quot;).

The group&#x27;s UK Top 10 hits include &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s the Way That You Do It)&quot; (1981), &quot;Really Saying Something&quot; (1982), &quot;Shy Boy&quot; (1982), &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot; (1983), &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; (1983), &quot;Robert De Niro&#x27;s Waiting...&quot; (1984), &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot; (1987), &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (1988), and the charity track &quot;Help!&quot; (1989), a cover of The Beatles&#x27; song. In 1986, they had a US No. 1 with another of their UK Top 10 hits, a cover of 1969 Shocking Blue&#x27;s song &quot;Venus&quot;. In total, they had eleven singles reaching the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (1983–1988). They are associated with the MTV-driven Second British Invasion of the US. The trio also performed on &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, a UK chart-topping collaborative charity single released in 1984. They topped the Australian ARIA albums chart in June 1988 with &quot;Wow!&quot; (1987), and earned Brit Award nominations for Best British Single for &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot;, and Best Music Video for their cover of The Supremes&#x27; single &quot;Nathan Jones&quot;.

Fahey left the group in 1988 and formed Shakespears Sister, best known for the UK No. 1 &quot;Stay&quot; (1992). She was replaced by Jacquie O&#x27;Sullivan. This line-up had UK Top 5 hits with &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (1988) and their cover of The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Help!&quot; (1989), recorded with comedy duo French and Saunders and comedian Kathy Burke for the charity Comic Relief. They also charted with &quot;Love, Truth and Honesty&quot; and their cover of The Supremes&#x27; song &quot;Nathan Jones&quot;. In 1989, they embarked on their first world tour and had another hit with a new remixed version of &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;. In 1990 and 1991, they had Top 30 hits with &quot;Only Your Love&quot;, &quot;Preacher Man&quot;, then the cover of The Doobie Brothers&#x27; song &quot;Long Train Running&quot;, and their new studio album &quot;Pop Life&quot;, which featured these singles and a fourth, &quot;Tripping on Your Love&quot;, which was released soon after the album. After O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s mid-1991 departure, Dallin and Woodward continued Bananarama as a duo, with further Top 30 hits including &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; (1992), &quot;More, More, More&quot; (1993), &quot;Move in My Direction&quot; (2005), and &quot;Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)&quot; (2005). Fahey temporarily rejoined Bananarama in 2017, and the band toured the UK and North America as a trio between November and August that year.

==Career==
===1980–1982: early years===
Bananarama formed in September 1980 when teenagers and childhood friends Sara Dallin and Keren Woodward moved from Bristol to London and met Siobhan Fahey. Dallin and Fahey were studying journalism at the London College of Fashion (University of Arts) and Woodward was working at the BBC in Portland Place. Dallin and Woodward were living at the YWCA and were about to be made homeless until Paul Cook, with whom they had become friends after meeting at a club, offered them a place to live above the former Sex Pistols rehearsal room in Denmark Street, Charing Cross. They took their name, in part, from the Roxy Music song &quot;Pyjamarama&quot;.

The trio were ardent followers of the punk rock and post-punk music scenes during the late 1970s and early 1980s. They often performed impromptu sets or backing vocals at gigs for such bands as The Monochrome Set, The Professionals, Subway Sect, Iggy Pop, Department S, The Nipple Erectors, and The Jam. In 1981, Bananarama recorded their first demo, &quot;Aie a Mwana&quot;, a cover of a song by Black Blood, sung in Swahili. The demo was heard at Demon Records, who consequently offered Bananarama their first deal. The song was an underground hit (UK No. 92) and Bananarama were signed by Decca (later London Records) and remained on the label until 1993. UK music magazine &quot;The Face&quot; featured an article on Bananarama after the release of their first single. This caught the attention of ex-Specials member Terry Hall, who invited them to collaborate with his new vocal group Fun Boy Three on their album and the single &quot;It Ain&#x27;t What You Do (It&#x27;s The Way That You Do It)&quot;. In 1982, the song hit the Top 5 in the UK and gave Bananarama their first significant mainstream success. Fun Boy Three then guested on Bananarama&#x27;s single, &quot;Really Saying Something&quot;, later that year.

===1982–1985: &quot;Deep Sea Skiving&quot; and &quot;Bananarama&quot;===

Bananarama experienced their greatest success during the period 1982 to 1989, with their first three albums primarily produced and co-written with Jolley &amp; Swain. Their debut album, &quot;Deep Sea Skiving&quot; (UK No. 7, US No. 63) (1983) contained several hit singles – &quot;Really Saying Something&quot; (UK No. 5) and &quot;Shy Boy&quot; (UK No. 4) – and included a cover version of &quot;Na Na Hey Hey (Kiss Him Goodbye)&quot; (UK No. 5). &quot;Cheers Then&quot; (UK No. 45) was released as the third single, with little chart success, but very positive reviews from critics. The album peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart and was certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). 

The band recorded a version of the Sex Pistols&#x27; song &quot;No Feelings&quot; in late 1982 for the soundtrack of the British teen-comedy film, &quot;Party Party&quot;. During 1982 and 1983, Bananarama did several promotional US press tours and TV appearances the first being on &quot;The Uncle Floyd Show&quot; and on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Solid Gold&quot;. The group had their first major success in the United States in 1984 with the Top 10 hit &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; (UK No. 8, US No. 9), bolstered by the song&#x27;s inclusion in the soundtrack to the 1984 film &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;. The song was ranked No. 44 on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;80s. &quot;Billboard&quot; named the song No. 13 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Girl Group Songs of All Time&quot;. 

Their second album, &quot;Bananarama&quot; (UK No. 16, US No. 30) was released in 1984. Single &quot;Rough Justice&quot; (UK #23) was written about Thomas Reilly, the band&#x27;s road manager and brother of Fahey&#x27;s boyfriend Jim Reilly (drummer of the Northern Irish punk band Stiff Little Fingers), who was shot and killed by a British soldier in Belfast in August 1983. The album contained the hit singles, &quot;Robert De Niro&#x27;s Waiting...&quot; (UK No. 3) and &quot;Rough Justice&quot; (UK No. 23). The track &quot;Hot Line to Heaven&quot; was also released as a single in the UK but failed to reach the Top 40, peaking at No. 58. The album peaked at No. 16 on the UK Albums Chart, reached the US Top 40 albums chart, and was certified Silver by the BPI. The trio also recorded the single, &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (US No. 70) for the 1984 American film of the same name. In 1984, Bananarama featured on the Band Aid single, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; and were the only artists to appear on both the original 1984 Band Aid and the 1989 Band Aid II versions (Fahey appeared on the 1984 version while O&#x27;Sullivan appeared on the 1989 version). The stand-alone single &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; (UK No. 31) was released in 1985, although it was later added to their third album &quot;True Confessions&quot;.

===1986–1987: &quot;True Confessions&quot; and international success===
In 1986, the band released their third album, &quot;True Confessions&quot;. The majority of the album was produced by Jolley &amp; Swain with the exception of &quot;Venus&quot; and &quot;More Than Physical&quot;. The album contains the group&#x27;s most commercially successful single to date, a cover version of Shocking Blue&#x27;s 1969 song &quot;Venus&quot;, which peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the United States. The music video for &quot;Venus&quot; received heavy airplay on MTV in the United States. In 2014, Matt Dunn of WhatCulture ranked the song at No. 5 in his &quot;15 unforgettable Stock Aitken Waterman singles&quot; list, describing it as a &quot;timeless classic of 80s synth pop, an instantly recognisable foot-tapping gem&quot;, while underlining the &quot;provocative video and all its fire, sexy choreography, coffin dancing and red patent-leather devil outfits&quot;. In 2021, British magazine &quot;Classic Pop&quot; ranked &quot;Venus&quot; No. 2 in their list of &quot;Top 40 Stock Aitken Waterman songs&quot;.

&quot;True Confessions&quot; reached No. 46 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 15 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the group&#x27;s highest-charting album on the latter chart. Tom Hibbert of &quot;Smash Hits&quot; praised the album as being &quot;undeniably, convincingly listenable&quot; and &quot;a proper pop &#x27;album&#x27;&quot;, adding that Bananarama &quot;make &#x27;intriguing&#x27; pop – and can even sustain the charm across an entire LP.&quot; Also in 1986, Dallin and Woodward were featured as backing vocalists on two songs on &quot;Family Album&quot;, produced by John Lydon. Follow-up single &quot;More Than Physical&quot; hit UK No. 41, and &quot;A Trick of the Night&quot; hit No. 32. 

During a press tour in New York City, the group also recorded a song &quot;Riskin&#x27; a Romance&quot; featured in the film &quot;The Secret of My Success&quot; (1987). In March 1987, Bananarama participated in the recording of the single &quot;Let It Be&quot; (UK No. 11) as members of the charity supergroup Ferry Aid. All sales from the single were donated to charity in response to the capsizing of the ferry MS &quot;Herald of Free Enterprise&quot;, which killed 193 people. Among the featured singers was Woodward, who sang with Nick Kamen.

===1987–1988: &quot;Wow!&quot; and Fahey&#x27;s departure===
In the wake of the success of &quot;Venus&quot;, Bananarama began work on the album &quot;Wow!&quot; The album reached No. 26 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 44 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200,while peaking at No. 1 in Australia. The album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 1988.

&quot;I Heard a Rumour&quot; (UK No. 14, US No. 4) was their strongest performing international hit from the album. &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot; (UK No. 3), one of their biggest UK hits, was nominated at the 1988 Brit Awards for best single. A further single, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; was also a hit (UK No. 20). After the third single from &quot;Wow!&quot; was released in early 1988, Fahey – who had married Eurythmics&#x27; Dave Stewart – left the group. Her last performance as a member of the group was &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot; at the Brit Awards in February 1988. She would later resurface in the BRIT Award–winning pop duo Shakespears Sister with Marcella Detroit.

===1988–1991: second line-up, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, &quot;Pop Life&quot; and world tour===
After Fahey&#x27;s exit, Jacquie O&#x27;Sullivan (formerly of the Shillelagh Sisters) joined the group in March 1988. The single &quot;I Want You Back&quot; (UK No. 5) was re-recorded with O&#x27;Sullivan, as was The Supremes cover &quot;Nathan Jones&quot; (UK No. 15) which was nominated for best video at the 1989 Brit Awards. &quot;Love, Truth and Honesty&quot; (UK No. 23) was released as a single from their 1988 retrospective compilation, &quot;Greatest Hits Collection&quot; (UK No. 3). At the same time, Bananarama entered the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the all-female group who have the most UK chart entries in history, a record they still hold.

As a fundraising charity single for Comic Relief in 1989, Bananarama recorded a cover of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Help!&quot; with Lananeeneenoonoo (UK No. 3), a mock girl-group created by British female comedy duo French and Saunders, with fellow comedian Kathy Burke. Also in 1989, the band embarked upon their first world tour, which included shows in North America, East Asia, and the UK. Bananarama&#x27;s 1991 album, &quot;Pop Life&quot;, saw Dallin&#x27;s and Woodward&#x27;s songwriting collaboration with their friend Youth. They worked with a variety of producers including Youth, Shep Pettibone, and Steve Jolley of Jolley &amp; Swain. They also incorporated a wider range of musical genres including reggae, flamenco guitar, and acid house. Singles &quot;Only Your Love&quot; (UK No. 27), &quot;Preacher Man&quot; (UK No. 20), a cover of the Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;Long Train Running&quot; (UK No. 30), and &quot;Tripping on Your Love&quot; (UK No. 76) were the group&#x27;s final releases with O&#x27;Sullivan. In a rave review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Chuck Eddy said that &quot;Pop Life&quot;, &quot;while energetic, is far moodier than anything they&#x27;ve ever done. The Gipsy Kings... help engineer the Doobie Brothers&#x27; &#x27;Long Train Running&#x27; into a scary locomotive blues. Other tracks venture deep into the dark tunnel of dreamland: Pulses from an alternate universe underline fizzy computerized harmonies; sleepy voices trying hard to wake up ask &#x27;What color are the skies where you live?&#x27;... Two other songs even have heavy psychedelic guitars. We usually visit Bananaramaland to escape our problems, but this album takes us to an eerier place than we&#x27;d ever expect.&quot;

===1992–2001: Duo re-launch, &quot;Please Yourself&quot;, &quot;Ultra Violet&quot; and &quot;Exotica&quot;===
In 1992, Dallin and Woodward returned as a duo and had a UK Top 30 hit with &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; (UK No. 24), which was the first single from the 1993 album &quot;Please Yourself&quot;. Other singles from the album were &quot;Last Thing on My Mind&quot; (UK No. 71) and a cover of the 1976 Andrea True Connection song &quot;More, More, More&quot; (UK No. 24). In July 2018, Mark Elliot of &quot;Classic Pop&quot; ranked &quot;Please Yourself&quot; as the 14th best album ever produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. He presented the album as &quot;a concept project [Waterman] billed &quot;ABBA-Banana&quot;, and considered &quot;Movin&#x27;On&quot; and &quot;Last Thing on My Mind&quot; as &quot;classics&quot;.

Their next offering was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Ultra Violet&quot; (entitled &quot;I Found Love&quot; in Japan) on a new label. The album and its three singles — &quot;I Found Love&quot;, &quot;Every Shade of Blue&quot;, and &quot;Take Me to Your Heart&quot; — were only released in some European countries, North America, Japan, and Australia, but not in Britain. In 1998, Dallin and Woodward asked Fahey to join them to record the track &quot;Waterloo&quot; (a cover of the classic ABBA song) for the Eurovision celebration &quot;A Song for Eurotrash&quot; on Channel 4. In 1999, Dallin, Woodward, and Fahey were interviewed together for an episode of the BBC music documentary series &quot;Young Guns Go For It&quot; dedicated to the group. In 2001, Dallin and Woodward, who had been frequently working in France, had recorded the album &quot;Exotica&quot; with the French label M6. The album also included a cover of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, Latin- and R&amp;B-influenced dance songs, and reinterpreted versions of their earlier hits.

===2002–2006: &quot;Very Best&quot; and &quot;Drama&quot;===
In 2002, the group released &quot;The Very Best of Bananarama&quot; to celebrate the group&#x27;s 20th anniversary, including their singles released from 1981 to 1993. They also recorded the song &quot;Love Him, Leave Him, Forget Him&quot; for Sky TV&#x27;s show &quot;Is Harry on the Boat?&quot; as well as the song &quot;U R My Baby&quot; for a German disco project. The album reached No. 43 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2005, Dallin and Woodward collaborated with Murlyn Music Group, writing and recording in Sweden for six months to produce the album &quot;Drama&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Move in My Direction&quot; debuted on the UK Singles Chart at No. 14, also becoming their first UK Top 40 entry since 1993. The second single, &quot;Look on the Floor (Hypnotic Tango)&quot;, also reached the UK Top 40, and climbed to No. 2 on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart as an import, becoming Bananarama&#x27;s biggest US dancefloor hit since &quot;Venus&quot; two decades earlier. &quot;Drama&quot; charted at No. 21 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Electronic Albums chart.

===2006–2011: Remasters and &quot;Viva&quot; ===

In 2006, Warner Bros. Records released &quot;The Twelve Inches of Bananarama&quot;, a compilation of twelve remixes on CD including the rare George Michael remix of &quot;Tripping on Your Love&quot;. On 19 March 2007, Bananarama&#x27;s first six studio albums were reissued by Rhino Records on CD with bonus material, including alternative versions, remixes, and B-sides. On 7 May 2007, another best-of collection titled &quot;Greatest Hits and More More More&quot; was released by Warner Bros. Records. 

In August 2008, Bananarama were back in the studio recording a track with Rev Run from Run-D.M.C.. The song, &#x27;Invincible&#x27;, credited as Rev Run featuring Bananarama, did not surface until late 2014 on Rev Run&#x27;s solo album &quot;Red Rhythm Rewind&quot;. In June 2009, Bananarama performed at the Isle of Wight Festival. In August 2009, they performed at the 80s Rewind Festival in Henley-on-Thames alongside other 1980s acts which included Rick Astley, Belinda Carlisle, and Kim Wilde. 

Bananarama released a new single entitled &quot;Love Comes&quot; (UK No. 44) and a new album &quot;Viva&quot; (UK No. 87) in September 2009. The album was produced by Ian Masterson and released through Fascination Records. A second single was released from the album in April 2010, a new remix of the song &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here&quot; (UK No. 114) backed by Ian Masterson&#x27;s 2010 reworking of the 1995 single &quot;Every Shade of Blue&quot; and &quot;The Runner&quot; (originally recorded by The Three Degrees), remixed by Buzz Junkies. In April 2011, Bananarama appeared on ITV&#x27;s hit comedy &quot;Benidorm&quot; and performed &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot;, &quot;Robert De Niro&#x27;s Waiting...&quot;, and &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot;.

===2012–2016: &quot;30 Years of Bananarama&quot;===
On 9 July 2012, Warner Music imprint Rhino Records released a greatest hits CD and DVD Collection &quot;30 Years of Bananarama&quot; to celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The CD features Bananarama&#x27;s 22 best-known singles, from their 1981 debut, &quot;Aie a Mwana&quot;, to their 2009 effort, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Live Here&quot;. All songs are presented in chronological order (except the bonus tracks on digital) with most of them being their album versions. The digital version includes three extra tracks &quot;Rough Justice&quot;, &quot;Long Train Running&quot;, and &quot;A Trick of the Night&quot;, adding up to a total of 25 tracks. The album charted at No. 62 on the UK Albums Chart. On 9 August 2012, the band performed at the men&#x27;s final of the beach volleyball at the London Olympics. They performed a medley of &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;, &quot;Love in the First Degree&quot;, and &quot;Venus&quot;. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked them the 94th most successful dance artist of all time.

===2017–present: original line-up tour, &quot;In Stereo&quot;, &quot;Really Saying Something&quot; and &quot;Masquerade&quot;===

On 23 April 2017, Fahey rejoined Bananarama. The Original Line-up Tour saw them perform 23 sell-out dates across the UK in November and December 2017. In February 2018, they played four dates in North America: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York City in the United States; and Toronto in Canada. Their final dates as a trio were in August 2018. On 22 December 2018, Dallin and Woodward again appeared as contestants on the Christmas Special of the game show &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot;. 

On 19 April 2019, Dallin and Woodward released their new album &quot;In Stereo&quot; (UK No. 29). On 29 April 2022, Dallin and Woodward released the track &quot;Favourite&quot; from their twelfth studio album &quot;Masquerade&quot;, which was released on 22 July 2022. On 15 June 2022, the album title track &quot;Masquerade&quot; was released as the first official single, and its music video followed two days later.

<text>Robert Mills Gagné (August 21, 1916 – April 28, 2002) was an American educational psychologist best known for his &quot;Conditions of Learning&quot;. He instructed during World War II when he worked with the Army Air Corps training pilots. He went on to develop a series of studies and works that simplified and explained what he and others believed to be good instruction. Gagné was also involved in applying concepts of instructional theory to the design of computer-based training and multimedia-based learning.
His work is sometimes summarized as the &quot;Gagné assumption&quot;: that different types of learning exist, and that different instructional conditions are most likely to bring about these different types of learning.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Robert Mills Gagné was born on August 21, 1916, in North Andover, Massachusetts. In high school, he decided to study psychology and be a psychologist after reading psychological texts. In his valedictory speech of 1932, Gagné professed that the science of psychology should be used to relieve the burdens of human life.

Gagné received a scholarship to Yale University, where he earned his A.B. in 1937. He then went on to receive his Sc.M. and Ph.D. at Brown University where he studied the conditioned operate response of white rats as part of his thesis.

=== Career ===
His first college teaching job was in 1940, at Connecticut College for Women.

His initial studies of people were interrupted by World War II. In the first year of war, at Psychological Research Unit No. 1, Maxwell Field, Alabama, he administered and scored aptitude tests to choose and sort aviation cadets. Thereafter, he was assigned to officer school in Miami Beach. He was commissioned a second lieutenant, and assigned to School of Aviation Medicine, Randolph Field, Fort Worth, Texas.

After the war, he held a temporary faculty position at Pennsylvania State University. He returned to Connecticut College for Women. In 1949, he accepted an offer to join the US Air Force organization that became the Air Force Personnel and Training Research Center, where he was research director of the Perceptual and Motor Skills Laboratory. In 1958, he returned to academia as professor at Princeton University, where his research shifted focus to the learning of problem solving and the learning of mathematics. In 1962, he joined the American Institutes for Research, where he wrote his first book, &quot;Conditions of Learning&quot;. He spent additional time in academia at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked with graduate students. With W. K. Roher, he presented a paper, &quot;Instructional Psychology&quot;, to the Annual Review of Psychology.

In 1969, he found a lasting home at “Florida State University”. He collaborated with L. J. Briggs on &quot;Principles of Learning&quot;. He published the second and third editions of &quot;The Conditions of Learning&quot;.

===Personal life===
Gagné&#x27;s wife, Pat, was a biologist. They had a son, Sam, and daughter, Ellen. His non-professional pursuits included constructing wood furniture and reading modern fiction. In 1993, he retired to Signal Mountain, Tennessee, with his wife. Dr. Gagné was known to base his foundations on behaviorism.

== Taxonomy ==
Gagné classified the types of learning outcomes by asking how learning might be demonstrated. His domains and outcomes of learning correspond to standard verbs.
* Cognitive Domain
:Verbal information - is stated: state, recite, tell, declare
:Intellectual skills - label or classify the concepts
:Intellectual skills - apply the rules and principles
:Intellectual skills - problem solve by generating solutions or procedures
::Discrimination: discriminate, distinguish, differentiate
::Concrete Concept: identify, name, specify, label
::Defined Concept: classify, categorize, type, sort (by definition)
::Rule: demonstrate, show, solve (using one rule)
::Higher order rule: generate, develop, solve (using two or more rules)
:Cognitive strategies - are used for learning: adopt, create, originate
* Affective Domain
:Attitudes - are demonstrated by preferring options: choose, prefer, elect, favor
* Psychomotor Domain
:Motor skills - enable physical performance: execute, perform, carry out

==Learning process==
Gagné&#x27;s theory stipulates that there are several types and levels of learning, and each of these types and levels requires instruction that is tailored to meet the needs of the pupil. The focus of Gagné&#x27;s theory is on the retention and honing of intellectual skills. The theory has been applied to the design of instruction in all fields, though in its original formulation special attention was given to military training settings.

===Eight ways to learn===

In 1956, Gagné devised a system of analyzing different conditions of learning from simple to complex. According to Gagné, higher orders of learning are built upon the lower levels, requiring a greater amount of previous knowledge to progress successfully; final capability is analysed as comprising subordinate skills in an order such that the lower levels can be predicted for positive transfer of higher level learning. The lower four orders focus on the behavioral aspects of learning, while the higher four focus on the cognitive aspects. In his original study on instruction, Gagné attributed individual differences in learning.

===Steps of planning instruction===
# Identify the types of learning outcomes: Each outcome may have prerequisite knowledge or skills that must be identified.
# Identify the internal conditions or processes the learner must have to achieve the outcomes.
# Identify the external conditions or instruction needed to achieve the outcomes.
# Specify the learning context.
# Record the characteristics of the learners.
# Select the media for instruction.
# Plan to motivate the learners.
# Test the instruction with learners in the form of formative evaluation.
# After the instruction has been used, summative evaluation is used to judge the effectiveness of the instruction.

===Nine Events of Instruction===
According to Gagné, learning occurs in a series of nine learning events, each of which is a condition for learning which must be accomplished before moving to the next in order. Similarly, instructional events should mirror the learning events:

# Gaining attention: To ensure reception of coming instruction, the teacher gives the learners a stimulus. Before the learners can start to process any new information, the instructor must gain the attention of the learners. This might entail using abrupt changes in the instruction.
# Informing learners of objectives: The teacher tells the learner what they will be able to do because of the instruction. The teacher communicates the desired outcome to the group.
# Stimulating recall of prior learning: The teacher asks for recall of existing relevant knowledge.
# Presenting the stimulus: The teacher gives emphasis to distinctive features.
# Providing learning guidance: The teacher helps the students in understanding (semantic encoding) by providing organization and relevance.
# Eliciting performance: The teacher asks the learners to respond, demonstrating learning.
# Providing feedback: The teacher gives informative feedback on the learners&#x27; performance.
# Assessing performance: The teacher requires more learner performance, and gives feedback, to reinforce learning.
# Enhancing retention and transfer: The teacher provides varied practice to generalize the capability.

Some educators believe that Gagné&#x27;s taxonomy of learning outcomes and events of instruction oversimplify the learning process by over-prescribing. However, using them as part of a complete instructional package can assist many educators in becoming more organized and staying focused on the instructional goals.

===Evaluation of instruction===
# Have the objectives been met?
# Is the new program better than the previous one?
# What additional effects does the new program include?

When objectively analyzing the conditions for learning Gagné says, &quot;Since the purpose of instruction is learning, the central focus for rational derivation of instructional techniques is the human learner. Development of rationally sound instructional procedures must take into account learner characteristics such as initiate capacities, experimental maturity, and current knowledge states. Such factors become parameters of the design of any particular program of instruction.&quot;

== Influence ==

Robert Gagné&#x27;s work has been the foundation of instructional design since the beginning of the 1960s when he conducted research and developed training materials for the military. Among the first to coin the term &quot;instructional design&quot;, Gagné developed some of the earliest instructional design models and ideas. These models have laid the groundwork for more present-day instructional design models from theorists like Dick, Carey, and Carey (The Dick and Carey Systems Approach Model), Jerold Kemp&#x27;s Instructional Design Model, and David Merrill (Merrill&#x27;s First Principle of Instruction). Each of these models are based on a core set of learning phases that include (1) activation of prior experience, (2) demonstration of skills, (3) application of skills, and (4) integration or these skills into real world activities.

Gagné&#x27;s main focus for instructional design was how instruction and learning could be systematically connected to the design of instruction. He emphasized the design principles and procedures that need to take place for effective teaching and learning. His initial ideas, along with the ideas of other early instructional designers were outlined in &quot;Psychological Principles in Systematic Development&quot;, written by Roberts B. Miller and edited by Gagné. Gagné believed in internal learning and motivation which paved the way for theorists like Merrill, Li, and Jones who designed the Instructional Transaction Theory, Reigeluth and Stein&#x27;s Elaboration Theory, and most notably, Keller&#x27;s ARCS Model of Motivation and Design.

Prior to Robert Gagné, learning was often thought of as a single, uniform process. There was little or no distinction made between &quot;learning to load a rifle and learning to solve a complex mathematical problem&quot;. Gagné offered an alternative view which developed the idea that different learners required different learning strategies. Understanding and designing instruction based on a learning style defined by the individual brought about new theories and approaches to teaching.
Gagné &#x27;s understanding and theories of human learning added significantly to understanding the stages in cognitive processing and instructions. For example, Gagné argued that instructional designers must understand the characteristics and functions of short-term and long-term memory to facilitate meaningful learning. This idea encouraged instructional designers to include cognitive needs as a top-down instructional approach.

Gagné (1966) defines curriculum as a sequence of content units arranged in such a way that the learning of each unit may be accomplished as a single act, provided the capabilities described by specified prior units (in the sequence) have already been mastered by the learner.

His definition of curriculum has been the basis of many important initiatives in schools and other educational environments. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Gagné had expressed and established an interest in applying theory to practice with particular interest in applications for teaching, training and learning. Increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of practice was of particular concern. His ongoing attention to practice while developing theory continues to influence education and training.

Gagné&#x27;s work has had a significant influence on American education, and military and industrial training. Gagné was one of the early developers of the concept of instructional systems design which suggests the components of a lesson can be analyzed and should be designed to operate together as an integrated plan for instruction. In &quot;Educational Technology and the Learning Process&quot; (Educational Researcher, 1974), Gagné defined instruction as &quot;the set of planned external events which influence the process of learning and thus promote learning&quot;.

<text>Husum (, ) is the capital of the &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) Nordfriesland in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The town was the birthplace of the novelist Theodor Storm, who coined the epithet &quot;the grey town by the sea&quot;. It is also the home of the annual international piano festival &quot;Raritäten der Klaviermusik&quot; (Rarities of Piano Music) founded in 1986.

==History==
Husum was first mentioned as &quot;Husembro&quot; in 1252, when king Abel was murdered.

Like most towns on the North Sea, Husum was always strongly influenced by storm tides. In 1362 a disastrous storm tide, the &quot;Grote Mandrenke&quot; flooded the town and carved out the inland harbour. Before this date Husum was not situated directly on the coast. The people of the city took advantage of this opportunity and built a marketplace, which led to a great economic upturn.

Between 1372 and 1398 the population of Husum grew rapidly, and two villages, &quot;Oster-Husum&quot; (East-Husum) and &quot;Wester-Husum&quot; (West-Husum), were founded.

The name &quot;Husum&quot; is first mentioned in 1409. It is shown on the Carta Marina in the Frisian form of Husem.

Its first church was built in 1431. Wisby rights were granted it in 1582, and in 1603 it received municipal privileges from Alexander, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. It suffered greatly from inundations in 1634 and 1717.

==Geography==
Husum is located on the North Sea by the Bay of Husum; 82 km W of Kiel, 139 km NW of Hamburg and 43 km SW of Flensburg.

<text>Alberto Mercado Monserrate (born January 2, 1961) is a former Jr. Featherweight boxer who was on the verge of fighting for a world title at least twice in his career.

==Amateur boxing career==
Mercado started boxing as an amateur at the age of 12, immediately winning a nationwide competition known as the &quot;Olimpiadas Jíbaras de la Vivienda&quot; (&quot;Housing Complex Hillbillies&#x27; Olympics&quot;). This motivated him to keep boxing as an amateur and hoping to win a world title in the future.

In 1978, Mercado represented Puerto Rico at the 1978 Central American and Caribbean Games held at Colombia. He won gold at these games and participated in a world cup tournament. Hoping to become the first Puerto Rican ever to win a gold medal at an Olympic Games, Mercado moved to Cuba periodically; there he trained hard towards that goal.

Around that era, Mercado befriended and worked alongside one of Jose Celso Barbosa&#x27;s children; he criticized the Puerto Rican government which was led by Carlos Romero Barcelo of the Statehood supporting New Progressive Party and was fired from his job and taken by Puerto Rico Olympic Committee President German Rieckehoff Sampayo to live in Mexico for a while.

Mercado was one of only three American citizens to participate in the 1980 Olympics celebrated in Moscow, Soviet Union, bearing the flag of and competing in boxing for Puerto Rico after having won the gold medal at the 1979 Pan American Games. The other two were also representants from Puerto Rico and boxers: Luis Pizarro and José Angel Molina.

During a 2021 Interview with Cuban-Puerto Rican journalist Jesus &quot;Chu&quot; Garcia on YouTube, Mercado remembered how he and his fellow Puerto Rican boxers Pizarro and Molina were the first delegates of any kind to arrive in Russia and how he flew on Aeroflot from Cuba to Russia to get there.

==1980 Olympic results==
Below is the record of Alberto Mercado, a Puerto Rican boxer who competed in the flyweight division at the 1980 Moscow Olympics:

* Round of 32: bye
* Round of 16: lost to Gilberto Roman (Mexico) referee stopped contest

==Professional career==

In the professional ranks Mercado had a winning record, but also had some bad luck. He lost to Refugio Rojas in a USBA Featherweight title try on points by split decision, and on a fight to decide the IBF&#x27;s #1 challenger, he lost by a knockout in 7 rounds to eventual world champion Antonio Rivera, after leading the fight on all scorecards at the end of round 6.

Mercado trained at the famous Bairoa gym at Caguas and he was friends with gym-mate Juan Carazo.

==Later life==
He had a professional record of 31 wins, 14 losses and 1 draw (tie), with 27 wins by knockout.

Mercado currently works at the gym of the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey. There were plans to build a small museum in Cayey dedicated to him; that museum, named &quot;Casa Museo Alberto Mercado&quot;, was opened in 2018. Alberto has three kids, who are Wilnelia Mercado, Gloribel Mercado and Luis Mercado. (in Spanish)

===Health problems===
Mercado discussed in 2021 that he suffers epilepsy, sudden memory loss and balance problems as a consequence of his boxing career, but takes medication to control these health problems.

<text>In vertebrate anatomy, the throat is the front part of the neck, internally positioned in front of the vertebrae. It contains the pharynx and larynx. An important section of it is the epiglottis, separating the esophagus from the trachea (windpipe), preventing food and drinks being inhaled into the lungs. The throat contains various blood vessels, pharyngeal muscles, the nasopharyngeal tonsil, the tonsils, the palatine uvula, the trachea, the esophagus, and the vocal cords. Mammal throats consist of two bones, the hyoid bone and the clavicle. The &quot;throat&quot; is sometimes thought to be synonymous for the fauces.

It works with the mouth, ears and nose, as well as a number of other parts of the body. Its pharynx is connected to the mouth, allowing speech to occur, and food and liquid to pass down the throat. It is joined to the nose by the nasopharynx at the top of the throat, and to the ear by its Eustachian tube. The throat&#x27;s trachea carries inhaled air to the bronchi of the lungs. The esophagus carries food through the throat to the stomach. Adenoids and tonsils help prevent infection and are composed of lymph tissue. The larynx contains vocal cords, the epiglottis (preventing food/liquid inhalation), and an area known as the subglottic larynx, in children it is the narrowest section of the upper part of the throat.
The &quot;jugulum&quot; is a low part of the throat, located slightly above the breast. The term &quot;jugulum&quot; is reflected both by the internal and external jugular veins, which pass through the &quot;jugulum&quot;.

<doc id="90664" wikidata="Q474184" url="?curid=90664" title="Manifest destiny">
<text>&quot;Manifest destiny&quot; is a phrase that represents the belief in the 19th-century United States that American settlers were destined to expand westward across North America, and that this belief was both obvious (&quot;manifest&quot;) and certain (&quot;destiny&quot;). The belief is rooted in American exceptionalism and Romantic nationalism, implying the inevitable spread of the republican form of governance. It is one of the earliest expressions of American imperialism in the United States of America.

According to historian William Earl Weeks, there were three basic tenets behind the concept:
* The assumption of the unique moral virtue of the United States.
* The assertion of its mission to redeem the world by the spread of republican government and more generally the &quot;American way of life&quot;.
* The faith in the nation&#x27;s divinely ordained destiny to succeed in this mission.

Manifest destiny remained heavily divisive in politics, causing constant conflict with regards to slavery in these new states and territories. It is also associated with the settler-colonial displacement of Indigenous Americans and the annexation of lands to the west of the United States borders at the time on the continent. The concept became one of several major campaign issues during the 1844 presidential election, where the Democratic Party won and the phrase &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; was coined within a year. The concept was used by Democrats to justify the 1846 Oregon boundary dispute and the 1845 annexation of Texas as a slave state, culminating in the 1846 Mexican–American War. In contrast, the large majority of Whigs and prominent Republicans (such as Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant) rejected the concept and campaigned against these actions. By 1843, former U.S. President John Quincy Adams, originally a major supporter of the concept underlying manifest destiny, had changed his mind and repudiated expansionism because it meant the expansion of slavery in Texas. Ulysses S. Grant served in and condemned the Mexican–American War, declaring it &quot;one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation&quot;. Historian Daniel Walker Howe summarizes that &quot;American imperialism did not represent an American consensus; it provoked bitter dissent within the national polity&quot;.

== Context ==
There was never a set of principles defining manifest destiny; it was always a general idea rather than a specific policy made with a motto. Ill-defined but keenly felt, manifest destiny was an expression of conviction in the morality and value of expansionism that complemented other popular ideas of the era, including American exceptionalism and Romantic nationalism. Andrew Jackson, who spoke of &quot;extending the area of freedom&quot;, typified the conflation of America&#x27;s potential greatness, the nation&#x27;s budding sense of Romantic self-identity, and its expansion.

Yet Jackson was not the only president to elaborate on the principles underlying manifest destiny. Owing in part to the lack of a definitive narrative outlining its rationale, proponents offered divergent or seemingly conflicting viewpoints. While many writers focused primarily upon American expansionism, be it into Mexico or across the Pacific, others saw the term as a call to example. Without an agreed-upon interpretation, much less an elaborated political philosophy, these conflicting views of America&#x27;s destiny were never resolved. This variety of possible meanings was summed up by Ernest Lee Tuveson: &quot;A vast complex of ideas, policies, and actions is comprehended under the phrase &#x27;Manifest Destiny&#x27;. They are not, as we should expect, all compatible, nor do they come from any one source.&quot;

==Etymology==
Most historians credit the conservative newspaper editor and future propagandist for the Confederacy, John O&#x27;Sullivan, with coining the term &quot;manifest destiny&quot; in 1845. However, other historians suggest the unsigned editorial titled &quot;Annexation&quot; in which it first appeared was written by journalist and annexation advocate Jane Cazneau.
O&#x27;Sullivan was an influential advocate for Jacksonian democracy, described by Julian Hawthorne as &quot;always full of grand and world-embracing schemes&quot;. O&#x27;Sullivan wrote an article in 1839 that, while not using the term &quot;manifest destiny&quot;, did predict a &quot;divine destiny&quot; for the United States based upon values such as equality, rights of conscience, and personal enfranchisement &quot;to establish on earth the moral dignity and salvation of man&quot;. This destiny was not explicitly territorial, but O&#x27;Sullivan predicted that the United States would be one of a &quot;Union of many Republics&quot; sharing those values.

Six years later, in 1845, O&#x27;Sullivan wrote another essay titled &quot;Annexation&quot; in the &quot;Democratic Review&quot;, in which he first used the phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot;. In this article he urged the U.S. to annex the Republic of Texas, not only because Texas desired this, but because it was &quot;our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions&quot;. Overcoming Whig opposition, Democrats annexed Texas in 1845. O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s first usage of the phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot; attracted little attention.

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s second use of the phrase became extremely influential. On December 27, 1845, in his newspaper the &quot;New York Morning News&quot;, O&#x27;Sullivan addressed the ongoing boundary dispute with Britain. O&#x27;Sullivan argued that the United States had the right to claim &quot;the whole of Oregon&quot;:
And that claim is by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us for the development of the great experiment of liberty and federated self-government entrusted to us.

That is, O&#x27;Sullivan believed that Providence had given the United States a mission to spread republican democracy (&quot;the great experiment of liberty&quot;). Because the British government would not spread democracy, thought O&#x27;Sullivan, British claims to the territory should be overruled. O&#x27;Sullivan believed that manifest destiny was a moral ideal (a &quot;higher law&quot;) that superseded other considerations.

O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s original conception of manifest destiny was not a call for territorial expansion by force. He believed that the expansion of the United States would happen without the direction of the U.S. government or the involvement of the military. After Americans immigrated to new regions, they would set up new democratic governments, and then seek admission to the United States, as Texas had done. In 1845, O&#x27;Sullivan predicted that California would follow this pattern next, and that even Canada would eventually request annexation as well. He was critical of the Mexican–American War in 1846, although he came to believe that the outcome would be beneficial to both countries.

Ironically, O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s term became popular only after it was criticized by Whig opponents of the Polk administration. Whigs denounced manifest destiny, arguing, &quot;that the designers and supporters of schemes of conquest, to be carried on by this government, are engaged in treason to our Constitution and Declaration of Rights, giving aid and comfort to the enemies of republicanism, in that they are advocating and preaching the doctrine of the right of conquest&quot;. On January 3, 1846, in a speech Representative Robert Winthrop used the term for the first time in Congress stating:There is one element in our title [to Oregon], however, which I confess that I have not named, and to which I may not have done entire justice. I mean that new revelation of right which has been designated as the right of our manifest destiny to spread over this whole continent. It has been openly avowed in a leading Administration journal that this, after all, is our best and strongest title-one so clear, so pre-eminent, and so indisputable, that if Great Britain had all our other titles in addition to her own, they would weigh nothing against it. The right of our manifest destiny! There is a right for a new chapter in the law of nations; or rather, in the special laws of our own country; for I suppose the right of a manifest destiny to spread will not be admitted to exist in any nation except the universal Yankee nation!&quot; Winthrop was the first in a long line of critics who suggested that advocates of manifest destiny were citing &quot;Divine Providence&quot; for justification of actions that were motivated by chauvinism and self-interest. Despite this criticism, expansionists embraced the phrase, which caught on so quickly that its origin was soon forgotten.

== Themes and influences ==
Historian Frederick Merk wrote in 1963 that the concept of manifest destiny was born out of &quot;a sense of mission to redeem the Old World by high example ... generated by the potentialities of a new earth for building a new heaven&quot;. Merk also states that manifest destiny was a heavily contested concept within the nation:

From the outset Manifest Destiny—vast in program, in its sense of continentalism—was slight in support. It lacked national, sectional, or party following commensurate with its magnitude. The reason was it did not reflect the national spirit. The thesis that it embodied nationalism, found in much historical writing, is backed by little real supporting evidence.
A possible influence is racial predominance, namely the idea that the American Anglo-Saxon race was &quot;separate, innately superior&quot; and &quot;destined to bring good government, commercial prosperity and Christianity to the American continents and the world&quot;. Author Reginald Horsman wrote in 1981, this view also held that &quot;inferior races were doomed to subordinate status or extinction.&quot; and that this was used to justify &quot;the enslavement of the blacks and the expulsion and possible extermination of the Indians&quot;.

The origin of the first theme, later known as American exceptionalism, was often traced to America&#x27;s Puritan heritage, particularly John Winthrop&#x27;s famous &quot;City upon a Hill&quot; sermon of 1630, in which he called for the establishment of a virtuous community that would be a shining example to the Old World. In his influential 1776 pamphlet &quot;Common Sense&quot;, Thomas Paine echoed this notion, arguing that the American Revolution provided an opportunity to create a new, better society:
We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A situation, similar to the present, hath not happened since the days of Noah until now. The birthday of a new world is at hand...

Many Americans agreed with Paine, and came to believe that the United States&#x27; virtue was a result of its special experiment in freedom and democracy. Thomas Jefferson, in a letter to James Monroe, wrote, &quot;it is impossible not to look forward to distant times when our rapid multiplication will expand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not the southern continent.&quot; To Americans in the decades that followed their proclaimed freedom for mankind, embodied in the Declaration of Independence, could only be described as the inauguration of &quot;a new time scale&quot; because the world would look back and define history as events that took place before, and after, the Declaration of Independence. It followed that Americans owed to the world an obligation to expand and preserve these beliefs.

The second theme&#x27;s origination is less precise. A popular expression of America&#x27;s mission was elaborated by President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s description in his December 1, 1862, message to Congress. He described the United States as &quot;the last, best hope of Earth&quot;. The &quot;mission&quot; of the United States was further elaborated during Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, in which he interpreted the American Civil War as a struggle to determine if any nation with democratic ideals could survive; this has been called by historian Robert Johannsen &quot;the most enduring statement of America&#x27;s Manifest Destiny and mission&quot;.

The third theme can be viewed as a natural outgrowth of the belief that God had a direct influence in the foundation and further actions of the United States. Political scientist and historian Clinton Rossiter described this view as summing &quot;that God, at the proper stage in the march of history, called forth certain hardy souls from the old and privilege-ridden nations ... and that in bestowing his grace He also bestowed a peculiar responsibility&quot;. Americans presupposed that they were not only divinely elected to maintain the North American continent, but also to &quot;spread abroad the fundamental principles stated in the Bill of Rights&quot;. In many cases this meant neighboring colonial holdings and countries were seen as obstacles rather than the destiny God had provided the United States.

Faragher&#x27;s 1997 analysis of the political polarization between the Democratic Party and the Whig Party is that:
Two Native American writers have recently tried to link some of the themes of manifest destiny to the original ideology of the 15th-century decree of the Doctrine of Christian Discovery. Nick Estes (a Lakota) links the 15th-century Catholic doctrine of distinguishing Christians from non-Christians in the expansion of European nations. Estes and international jurist Tonya Gonnella Frichner (of the Onondaga Nation) further link the doctrine of discovery to &quot;Johnson v. McIntosh&quot; and frame their arguments on the correlation between manifest destiny and Doctrine of Christian Discovery by using the statement made by Chief Justice John Marshall during the case, as he &quot;spelled out the rights of the United states to Indigenous lands&quot; and drew upon the Doctrine of Christian Discovery for his statement. Marshall ruled that &quot;indigenous peoples possess &#x27;occupancy&#x27; rights, meaning their lands could be taken by the powers of &#x27;discovery&#x27;&quot;. Frichner explains that &quot;The newly formed United States needed to manufacture an American Indian political identity and concept of Indian land that would open the way for united states and westward colonial expansion.&quot; In this way, manifest destiny was inspired by the original European colonization of the Americas, and it excuses U.S. violence against Indigenous Nations.

According to historian Dorceta Taylor: &quot;Minorities are not usually chronicled as explorers or environmental activists, yet the historical records show that they were a part of expeditions, resided and worked on the frontier, founded towns, and were educators and entrepreneurs. In short, people of color were very important actors in westward expansion.&quot;

The desire for trade with China and other Asian countries was another ground for expansionism, with Americans seeing prospects of westward contact with Asia as fulfilling long-held Western hopes of finding new routes to Asia, and perceiving the Pacific as less unruly and dominated by Old World conflicts than the Atlantic and therefore a more inviting area for the new nation to expand its influence in.

== Debate over Manifest destiny ==
With the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, which doubled the size of the United States, Thomas Jefferson set the stage for the continental expansion of the United States. Many began to see this as the beginning of a new providential mission: If the United States was successful as a &quot;shining city upon a hill&quot;, people in other countries would seek to establish their own democratic republics. Not all Americans or their political leaders believed that the United States was a divinely favored nation, or thought that it ought to expand. For example, many Whigs opposed territorial expansion based on the Democratic claim that the United States was destined to serve as a virtuous example to the rest of the world, and also had a divine obligation to spread its superordinate political system and a way of life throughout North American continent. Many in the Whig party &quot;were fearful of spreading out too widely&quot;, and they &quot;adhered to the concentration of national authority in a limited area&quot;. In July 1848, Alexander Stephens denounced President Polk&#x27;s expansionist interpretation of America&#x27;s future as &quot;mendacious&quot;.

In the mid‑19th century, expansionism, especially southward toward Cuba, also faced opposition from those Americans who were trying to abolish slavery. As more territory was added to the United States in the following decades, &quot;extending the area of freedom&quot; in the minds of southerners also meant extending the institution of slavery. That is why slavery became one of the central issues in the continental expansion of the United States before the Civil War.

Before and during the Civil War both sides claimed that America&#x27;s destiny was rightfully their own. Abraham Lincoln opposed anti-immigrant nativism, and the imperialism of manifest destiny as both unjust and unreasonable. He objected to the Mexican war and believed each of these disordered forms of patriotism threatened the inseparable moral and fraternal bonds of liberty and union that he sought to perpetuate through a patriotic love of country guided by wisdom and critical self-awareness. Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, June 6, 1852, provides the most cogent expression of his reflective patriotism.

Ulysses S. Grant served in the war with Mexico and later wrote:
I was bitterly opposed to the measure [to annex Texas], and to this day regard the war [with Mexico] which resulted as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering justice in their desire to acquire additional territory... The Southern rebellion was largely the outgrowth of the Mexican war. Nations, like individuals, are punished for their transgressions. We got our punishment in the most sanguinary and expensive war of modern times.

== Era of expansion ==

The phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot; is associated with the territorial expansion of the United States from 1803 to 1898. Some scholars limit the period to solely North American continental expansion from the Louisiana Purchase to the acquisition of Alaska in 1867, somtimes called the &quot;age of manifest destiny&quot;. During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—&quot;from sea to shining sea&quot;—largely defining the borders of the continental United States as they are today. In the 1890s, the United States expanded into Polynesia and Asia with the annexation of the Republic of Hawaii, the Philippines, and Guam. The last territorial expansion of the United States came in 1986 when the Northern Mariana Islands chose to become a U.S. territory.

=== War of 1812 ===

One of the goals of the War of 1812 was to threaten to annex the British colony of Lower Canada as a bargaining chip to force the British to abandon their fortifications in the Northwestern United States and support for the various Native American tribes residing there. The result of this overoptimism was a series of defeats in 1812 in part due to the wide use of poorly-trained state militias rather than regular troops. The American victories at the Battle of Lake Erie and the Battle of the Thames in 1813 ended the Indian raids and removed the main reason for threatening annexation. To end the War of 1812 John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay and Albert Gallatin (former treasury secretary and a leading expert on Indians) and the other American diplomats negotiated the Treaty of Ghent in 1814 with Britain. They rejected the British plan to set up an Indian state in U.S. territory south of the Great Lakes. They explained the American policy toward acquisition of Indian lands:
A shocked Henry Goulburn, one of the British negotiators at Ghent, remarked, after coming to understand the American position on taking the Indians&#x27; land:
=== Continentalism ===
The 19th-century belief that the United States would eventually encompass all of North America is known as &quot;continentalism&quot;. An early proponent of this idea, John Quincy Adams became a leading figure in U.S. expansion between the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Polk administration in the 1840s. In 1811, Adams wrote to his father:

The whole continent of North America appears to be destined by Divine Providence to be peopled by one &quot;nation&quot;, speaking one language, professing one general system of religious and political principles, and accustomed to one general tenor of social usages and customs. For the common happiness of them all, for their peace and prosperity, I believe it is indispensable that they should be associated in one federal Union.
Adams did much to further this idea. He orchestrated the Treaty of 1818, which established the border between British North America and the United States as far west as the Rocky Mountains, and provided for the joint occupation of the region known in American history as the Oregon Country and in British and Canadian history as the New Caledonia and Columbia Districts. He negotiated the Transcontinental Treaty in 1819, transferring Florida from Spain to the United States and extending the U.S. border with Spanish Mexico all the way to the Pacific Ocean. And he formulated the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, which warned Europe that the Western Hemisphere was no longer open for European colonization.

The Monroe Doctrine and &quot;manifest destiny&quot; formed a closely related nexus of principles: historian Walter McDougall calls manifest destiny a corollary of the Monroe Doctrine, because while the Monroe Doctrine did not specify expansion, expansion was necessary in order to enforce the doctrine. Concerns in the United States that European powers were seeking to acquire colonies or greater influence in North America led to calls for expansion in order to prevent this. In his influential 1935 study of manifest destiny, done in conjunction with the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations, Albert Weinberg wrote: &quot;the expansionism of the [1830s] arose as a defensive effort to forestall the encroachment of Europe in North America&quot;.

==== Transcontinental railroad ====
Manifest destiny played an important role in the development of the transcontinental railroad. The transcontinental railroad system is often used in manifest destiny imagery like John Gast&#x27;s painting, American Progress where multiple locomotives are seen traveling west. According to academic Dina Gilio-Whitaker, &quot;the transcontinental railroads not only enabled [U.S. control over the continent] but also accelerated it exponentially.&quot; Historian Boyd Cothran says that &quot;modern transportation development and abundant resource exploitation gave rise to an appropriation of indigenous land, [and] resources.&quot;

==== All Oregon ====
Manifest destiny played its most important role in the Oregon boundary dispute between the United States and Britain, when the phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot; originated. The Anglo-American Convention of 1818 had provided for the joint occupation of the Oregon Country, and thousands of Americans migrated there in the 1840s over the Oregon Trail. The British rejected a proposal by U.S. President John Tyler (in office 1841–1845) to divide the region along the 49th parallel, and instead proposed a boundary line farther south, along the Columbia River, which would have made most of what later became the state of Washington part of their colonies in North America. Advocates of manifest destiny protested and called for the annexation of the entire Oregon Country up to the Alaska line (54°40ʹ N). Presidential candidate Polk used this popular outcry to his advantage, and the Democrats called for the annexation of &quot;All Oregon&quot; in the 1844 U.S. presidential election.

As president, Polk sought compromise and renewed the earlier offer to divide the territory in half along the 49th parallel, to the dismay of the most ardent advocates of manifest destiny. When the British refused the offer, American expansionists responded with slogans such as &quot;The whole of Oregon or none&quot; and &quot;Fifty-four forty or fight&quot;, referring to the northern border of the region. (The latter slogan is often mistakenly described as having been a part of the 1844 presidential campaign.) When Polk moved to terminate the joint occupation agreement, the British finally agreed in early 1846 to divide the region along the 49th parallel, leaving the lower Columbia basin as part of the United States. The Oregon Treaty of 1846 formally settled the dispute; Polk&#x27;s administration succeeded in selling the treaty to Congress because the United States was about to begin the Mexican–American War, and the president and others argued it would be foolish to also fight the British Empire.

Despite the earlier clamor for &quot;All Oregon&quot;, the Oregon Treaty was popular in the United States and was easily ratified by the Senate. The most fervent advocates of manifest destiny had not prevailed along the northern border because, according to Reginald Stuart, &quot;the compass of manifest destiny pointed west and southwest, not north, despite the use of the term &#x27;continentalism.

In 1869, American historian Frances Fuller Victor published &quot;&quot; in the &quot;Overland Monthly&quot;, arguing that the efforts of early American fur traders and missionaries presaged American control of Oregon. She concluded the article as follows:
=== Mexico and Texas ===
Manifest destiny played an important role in the expansion of Texas and American relationship with Mexico. In 1836, the Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico and, after the Texas Revolution, sought to join the United States as a new state. This was an idealized process of expansion that had been advocated from Jefferson to O&#x27;Sullivan: newly democratic and independent states would request entry into the United States, rather than the United States extending its government over people who did not want it. The annexation of Texas was attacked by anti-slavery spokesmen because it would add another slave state to the Union. Presidents Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren declined Texas&#x27;s offer to join the United States in part because the slavery issue threatened to divide the Democratic Party.

Before the election of 1844, Whig candidate Henry Clay and the presumed Democratic candidate, former president, Van Buren, both declared themselves opposed to the annexation of Texas, each hoping to keep the troublesome topic from becoming a campaign issue. This unexpectedly led to Van Buren being dropped by the Democrats in favor of Polk, who favored annexation. Polk tied the Texas annexation question with the Oregon dispute, thus providing a sort of regional compromise on expansion. (Expansionists in the North were more inclined to promote the occupation of Oregon, while Southern expansionists focused primarily on the annexation of Texas.) Although elected by a very slim margin, Polk proceeded as if his victory had been a mandate for expansion.

==== All of Mexico ====
After the election of Polk, but before he took office, Congress approved the annexation of Texas. Polk moved to occupy a portion of Texas that had declared independence from Mexico in 1836, but was still claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the Mexican–American War on April 24, 1846. With American successes on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of &quot;All Mexico&quot;, particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.

This was a controversial proposition for two reasons. First, idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like O&#x27;Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of &quot;All Mexico&quot; would be a violation of this principle. And secondly, the annexation of Mexico was controversial because it would mean extending U.S. citizenship to millions of Mexicans, who were of dark skin and majority Catholic. Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, who had approved of the annexation of Texas, was opposed to the annexation of Mexico, as well as the &quot;mission&quot; aspect of manifest destiny, for racial reasons. He made these views clear in a speech to Congress on January 4, 1848:

We have never dreamt of incorporating into our Union any but the Caucasian race—the free white race. To incorporate Mexico, would be the very first instance of the kind, of incorporating an Indian race; for more than half of the Mexicans are Indians, and the other is composed chiefly of mixed tribes. I protest against such a union as that! Ours, sir, is the Government of a white race... We are anxious to force free government on all; and I see that it has been urged ... that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty over all the world, and especially over this continent. It is a great mistake.

This debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of manifest destiny: on the one hand, while identitarian ideas inherent in manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans, as non-whites, would present a threat to white racial integrity and thus were not qualified to become Americans, the &quot;mission&quot; component of manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or &quot;regenerated&quot;, as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the &quot;All Mexico&quot; movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny. Conversely, proponents of annexation of &quot;All Mexico&quot; regarded it as an anti-slavery measure.
The controversy was eventually ended by the Mexican Cession, which added the territories of Alta California and Nuevo México to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the &quot;All Oregon&quot; movement, the &quot;All Mexico&quot; movement quickly abated.

Historian Frederick Merk, in &quot;Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation&quot; (1963), argued that the failure of the &quot;All Oregon&quot; and &quot;All Mexico&quot; movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive &quot;continentalism&quot; were aberrations supported by only a minority of Americans, all of them Democrats. Some Democrats were also opposed; the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico, while those in Mississippi supported it.

These events related to the Mexican–American War and had an effect on the American people living in the Southern Plains at the time. A case study by David Beyreis depicts these effects through the operations of a fur trading and Indian trading business named Bent, St. Vrain and Company during the period. The telling of this company shows that the idea of Manifest Destiny was not unanimously loved by all Americans and did not always benefit Americans. The case study goes on to show that this company could have ceased to exist in the name of territorial expansion.

=== Filibusterism ===
After the Mexican–American War ended in 1848, disagreements over the expansion of slavery made further annexation by conquest too divisive to be official government policy. Some, such as John Quitman, Governor of Mississippi, offered what public support they could. In one memorable case, Quitman simply explained that the state of Mississippi had &quot;lost&quot; its state arsenal, which began showing up in the hands of filibusters. Yet these isolated cases only solidified opposition in the North as many Northerners were increasingly opposed to what they believed to be efforts by Southern slave owners—and their friends in the North—to expand slavery through filibustering. Sarah P. Remond on January 24, 1859, delivered an impassioned speech at Warrington, England, that the connection between filibustering and slave power was clear proof of &quot;the mass of corruption that underlay the whole system of American government&quot;. The Wilmot Proviso and the continued &quot;Slave Power&quot; narratives thereafter, indicated the degree to which manifest destiny had become part of the sectional controversy.

Without official government support the most radical advocates of manifest destiny increasingly turned to military filibustering. Originally filibuster had come from the Dutch &quot;vrijbuiter&quot; and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the &quot;New-York Daily Times&quot; &quot;the fever of Fillibusterism is on our country. Her pulse beats like a hammer at the wrist, and there&#x27;s a very high color on her face.&quot; Millard Fillmore&#x27;s second annual message to Congress, submitted in December 1851, gave double the amount of space to filibustering activities than the brewing sectional conflict. The eagerness of the filibusters, and the public to support them, had an international hue. Clay&#x27;s son, a diplomat in Portugal, reported that the invasion created a sensation in Lisbon.
Although they were illegal, filibustering operations in the late 1840s and early 1850s were romanticized in the United States. The Democratic Party&#x27;s national platform included a plank that specifically endorsed William Walker&#x27;s filibustering in Nicaragua. Wealthy American expansionists financed dozens of expeditions, usually based out of New Orleans, New York, and San Francisco. The primary target of manifest destiny&#x27;s filibusters was Latin America but there were isolated incidents elsewhere. Mexico was a favorite target of organizations devoted to filibustering, like the Knights of the Golden Circle. William Walker got his start as a filibuster in an ill-advised attempt to separate the Mexican states Sonora and Baja California. Narciso López, a near second in fame and success, spent his efforts trying to secure Cuba from the Spanish Empire.

The United States had long been interested in acquiring Cuba from the declining Spanish Empire. As with Texas, Oregon, and California, American policy makers were concerned that Cuba would fall into British hands, which, according to the thinking of the Monroe Doctrine, would constitute a threat to the interests of the United States. Prompted by O&#x27;Sullivan, in 1848 President Polk offered to buy Cuba from Spain for $100 million. Polk feared that filibustering would hurt his effort to buy the island, and so he informed the Spanish of an attempt by the Cuban filibuster López to seize Cuba by force and annex it to the United States, foiling the plot. Spain declined to sell the island, which ended Polk&#x27;s efforts to acquire Cuba. O&#x27;Sullivan eventually landed in legal trouble.

Filibustering continued to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of Franklin Pierce, a filibustering effort by John A. Quitman to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130 million. When the public learned of the Ostend Manifesto in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused to sell, this effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.

Filibusters like William Walker continued to garner headlines in the late 1850s, but to little effect. Expansionism was among the various issues that played a role in the coming of the war. With the divisive question of the expansion of slavery, Northerners and Southerners, in effect, were coming to define manifest destiny in different ways, undermining nationalism as a unifying force. According to Frederick Merk, &quot;The doctrine of Manifest Destiny, which in the 1840s had seemed Heaven-sent, proved to have been a bomb wrapped up in idealism.&quot;

The filibusterism of the era even opened itself up to some mockery among the headlines. In 1854, a San Francisco Newspaper published a satirical poem called &quot;Filibustering Ethics&quot;. This poem features two characters, Captain Robb and Farmer Cobb. Captain Robb makes claim to Farmer Cobb&#x27;s land arguing that Robb deserves the land because he is Anglo-Saxon, has weapons to &quot;blow out&quot; Cobb&#x27;s brains, and nobody has heard of Cobb so what right does Cobb have to claim the land. Cobb argues that Robb doesn&#x27;t need his land because Robb already has more land than he knows what to do with. Due to threats of violence, Cobb surrenders his land and leaves grumbling that &quot;&quot;might&quot; should be the rule of &quot;right&quot; among &quot;enlightened&quot; nations.&quot;

=== Homestead Act ===
The Homestead Act of 1862 encouraged 600,000 families to settle the West by giving them land (usually 160 acres) almost free. Over the course of 123 years, 200 million claims were made and over 270 million acres were settled, accounting for 10% of the land in the U.S. They had to live on and improve the land for five years. Before the American Civil War, Southern leaders opposed the Homestead Acts because they feared it would lead to more free states and free territories. After the mass resignation of Southern senators and representatives at the beginning of the war, Congress was subsequently able to pass the Homestead Act.

In some areas, the Homestead Act resulted in the direct removal of Indigenous communities. According to American historian Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, all five nations of the &quot;Five Civilized Tribes&quot; signed treaties with the Confederacy and initially supported them in hopes of dividing and weakening the U.S. so that they could remain on their land. The United States Army, led by prominent Civil War generals such as William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and George Armstrong Custer, waged wars on &quot;non-treaty Indians&quot; who continued to live on land that had already been ceded to the U.S. through treaty. Homesteaders and other settlers soon followed and took possession of the land for farms and mining. Occasionally, white settlers would move ahead of the U.S. Army, into land that had not yet been settled by the United States, causing conflict with the Native people who still resided there. According to Anglo-American historian Julius Wilm, while the U.S. government did not approve of settlers moving ahead of the army, Indian Affairs officials did believe &quot;the move of frontier whites into the proximity of contested territory—be they homesteaders or parties interested in other pursuits—necessitated the removal of Indigenous nations.&quot;

According to historian Hannah Anderson, the Homestead Act also led to environmental degradation. While it succeeded in settling and farming the land, the Act failed to preserve the land. Continuous plowing of the top soil made the soil vulnerable to erosion and wind, as well as stripping the nutrients from the ground. This deforestation and erosion would play a key role in the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. Intense logging caused a decrease in much of the forests and hunting harmed many of the native animal populations, including the bison, whose population was reduced to a few hundreds.

=== Acquisition of Alaska ===
The final U.S. territorial expansion of the North American mainland came in 1867 when the U.S. purchased Alaska. In the aftermath of the Crimean War in the 1850s, Emperor Alexander II of Russia decided to relinquish control of the ailing Russian America (present-day Alaska) on fears that the territory would easily be lost in any future war between Russia and the United Kingdom. In 1865, U.S. Secretary of State William H. Seward entered into negotiations with Russian minister Eduard de Stoeckl for the purchase of Alaska. Seward initially offered $5 million to Stoeckl; the two men settled on $7 million and on March 15, 1867, Seward presented a draft treaty to the U.S. Cabinet. Stoeckl&#x27;s superiors raised several concerns; to induce him to waive them, the final purchase price was increased to $7.2 million and on March 30, the treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate. The transfer ceremony took place in Sitka, Alaska on October 18. Russian and American soldiers paraded in front of the governor&#x27;s house; the Russian flag was lowered and the American flag raised amid peals of artillery.

The purchase added of new territory to the United States, an area about twice the size of Texas. Some proponents of the purchase, including Seward, had originally intended to acquire further land in the vicinity of the Arctic, potentially culminating in an annexation of Canada; even after Canada&#x27;s 1867 Confederation, there was a hope to at least acquire western regions such as British Columbia that were close to Alaska. Reactions to the purchase in the United States were mostly positive, as many believed the possession of Alaska would serve as a base to expand American trade in Asia. Some opponents labeled the purchase as &quot;Seward&#x27;s Folly&quot;, or &quot;Seward&#x27;s Icebox&quot;, as they contended that the United States had acquired useless land. Nearly all Russian settlers left Alaska in the aftermath of the purchase; Alaska attracted few new settlers until the Klondike Gold Rush began in 1896. Originally organized as the Department of Alaska, the area was renamed the District of Alaska and the Territory of Alaska before becoming the modern State of Alaska in 1959.

The start of the Klondike Gold Rush brought 200,000 prospectors to Alaska. The gold rush greatly increased the U.S. government&#x27;s commitment to developing the industrial infrastructure, and in turn attracting new residents to maintain it. The increase in gold seekers brought epidemics and land conflicts between settlers and Indigenous Alaskans. According to Yupik historian Shari Huhndorf, &quot;These changing demographics transformed social relationships between Native and the newcomers and soon led to Jim Crow-like segregation supported by a rapidly expanding territorial government.&quot;

In 1905, the Nelson Act was passed, which allowed the Territory of Alaska to open schools outside of incorporated towns and run them outside of the federal Bureau of Education&#x27;s control. According to historian Carol Barnhardt, the Territory of Alaska opened schools for &quot;white children and children of mixed blood leading a civilized life,&quot; while schools for Native children were still run by the Bureau of Education, which operated with the belief that it was important to transform Native Alaskans, along with all Indigenous people in America, into civilized Christians. The U.S. government saw education as the most effective way to achieve this goal. Overall, there was little recognition of the important differences between different groups of Indigenous people. The federal Bureau of Education also extended services such as medical services, cooperative stores, and a ship to supply remote coastal villages, slowly reducing the self-sufficiency of Native communities and allowing the U.S. government to assume more control of the lives of Native Alaskans. The effects of the Alaska Purchase are still felt by Native Alaskans. According to Inuit author Sheila Watt-Cloutier, &quot;The land that is such an important part of our spirit, our culture, and our physical and economic well-being is becoming an often unpredictable and precarious place for us.&quot;

=== Beyond North America: Annexation of Hawaii ===

In 1859, Reuben Davis, a member of the House of Representatives from Mississippi, articulated one of the most expansive visions of manifest destiny on record:
We may expand so as to include the whole world. Mexico, Central America, South America, Cuba, the West India Islands, and even England and France [we] might annex without inconvenience... allowing them with their local Legislatures to regulate their local affairs in their own way. And this, Sir, is the mission of this Republic and its ultimate destiny.
As the Civil War faded into history, the term &quot;manifest destiny&quot; experienced a brief revival. Protestant missionary Josiah Strong, in his best-seller of 1885, &quot;Our Country&quot;, argued that the future was devolved upon America since it had perfected the ideals of civil liberty, &quot;a pure spiritual Christianity&quot;, and concluded, &quot;My plea is not, Save America for America&#x27;s sake, but, Save America for the world&#x27;s sake.&quot;

In the 1892 U.S. presidential election, the Republican Party platform proclaimed: &quot;We reaffirm our approval of the Monroe doctrine and believe in the achievement of the manifest destiny of the Republic in its broadest sense.&quot; What was meant by &quot;manifest destiny&quot; in this context was not clearly defined, particularly since the Republicans lost the election.

In the 1896 election, the Republicans recaptured the White House and held on to it for the next 16 years. During that time, manifest destiny was cited to promote overseas expansion. Whether or not this version of manifest destiny was consistent with the continental expansionism of the 1840s was debated at the time, and long afterwards.

For example, when President William McKinley advocated annexation of the Republic of Hawaii in 1898, he said that &quot;We need Hawaii just as much and a good deal more than we did California. It is manifest destiny.&quot; On the other hand, former President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat who had blocked the annexation of Hawaii during his administration, wrote that McKinley&#x27;s annexation of the territory was a &quot;perversion of our national destiny&quot;. Historians continued that debate; some have interpreted American acquisition of other Pacific island groups in the 1890s as an extension of manifest destiny across the Pacific Ocean. Others have regarded it as the antithesis of manifest destiny and merely imperialism.

=== Spanish–American War ===

In 1898, the United States intervened in the Cuban insurrection and launched the Spanish–American War to force Spain out. According to the terms of the Treaty of Paris, Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba and ceded the Philippine Islands, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States. The terms of cession for the Philippines involved a payment of the sum of $20 million by the United States to Spain. The treaty was highly contentious and denounced by William Jennings Bryan, who tried to make it a central issue in the 1900 election. He was defeated in landslide by McKinley.

The Teller Amendment, passed unanimously by the U.S. Senate before the war, which proclaimed Cuba &quot;free and independent&quot;, forestalled annexation of the island. The Platt Amendment (1902) then established Cuba as a virtual protectorate of the United States.

The acquisition of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines after the war with Spain marked a new chapter in U.S. history. Traditionally, territories were acquired by the United States for the purpose of becoming new states on equal footing with already existing states. These islands were acquired as colonies rather than prospective states. The process was validated by the Insular Cases. The Supreme Court ruled that full constitutional rights did not automatically extend to all areas under American control.

According to Frederick Merk, these colonial acquisitions marked a break from the original intention of manifest destiny. Previously, &quot;Manifest Destiny had contained a principle so fundamental that a Calhoun and an O&#x27;Sullivan could agree on it—that a people not capable of rising to statehood should never be annexed. That was the principle thrown overboard by the imperialism of 1899.&quot; Albert J. Beveridge maintained the contrary at his September 25, 1900, speech in the Auditorium, at Chicago. He declared that the current desire for Cuba and the other acquired territories was identical to the views expressed by Washington, Jefferson and Marshall. Moreover, &quot;the sovereignty of the Stars and Stripes can be nothing but a blessing to any people and to any land.&quot; The nascent revolutionary government, desirous of independence, resisted the United States in the Philippine–American War in 1899; it won no support from any government anywhere and collapsed when its leader was captured. William Jennings Bryan denounced the war and any form of future overseas expansion, writing, Destiny&#x27; is not as manifest as it was a few weeks ago.&quot;

In 1917, all Puerto Ricans were made full American citizens via the Jones Act, which also provided for a popularly elected legislature and a bill of rights, and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner who has a voice (but no vote) in Congress. In 1934, the Tydings–McDuffie Act put the Philippines on a path to independence, which was realized in 1946 with the Treaty of Manila. The Guam Organic Act of 1950 established Guam alongside Puerto Rico as an unincorporated unorganized territory of the United States, provided for the structure of the island&#x27;s civilian government, and granted the people U.S. citizenship.

=== 21st century ===

In 2025 Donald Trump became the first president to use the phrase &quot;Manifest destiny&quot; during an inaugural address declaring an extension of American influence &quot;into the stars&quot; with ambitions to plant the American flag on Mars. Since being elected, Trump has said at various points that he wants to annex Canada, Greenland, and the Panama Canal. He has also suggested invading Venezuela, annexing Mexico and taking over the Gaza Strip. According to a poll by YouGov, only 4% of Americans support American expansion if it requires military force. 33% of Americans support expansion without the use of military or economic force, and 48% of Americans oppose expansion all together.

==Impact on Native Americans==

Manifest destiny had serious consequences for Native Americans, since continental expansion implicitly meant the occupation and annexation of Native American land, sometimes to expand slavery. This ultimately led to confrontations and wars with several groups of native peoples via Indian removal. The United States continued the European practice of recognizing only limited land rights of Indigenous peoples. In a policy formulated largely by Henry Knox, Secretary of War in the Washington Administration, the U.S. government sought to expand into the west through the purchase of Native American land in treaties. Only the Federal Government could purchase Indian lands, and this was done through treaties with tribal leaders. Whether a tribe actually had a decision-making structure capable of making a treaty was a controversial issue. The national policy was for the Indians to join American society and become &quot;civilized&quot;, which meant no more wars with neighboring tribes or raids on white settlers or travelers, and a shift from hunting to farming and ranching. Advocates of civilization programs believed that the process of settling native tribes would greatly reduce the amount of land needed by the Native Americans, making more land available for homesteading by white Americans. Thomas Jefferson believed that, while the Indigenous people of America were intellectual equals to whites, they had to assimilate to and live like the whites or inevitably be pushed aside by them.

According to historian Jeffrey Ostler, Jefferson believed that once assimilation was no longer possible, he advocated for the extermination of Indigenous people.
On February 27, 1803, Jefferson wrote in a letter to William Henry Harrison:&quot;but this letter being unofficial, &amp; private, I may with safety give you a more extensive view of our policy respecting the Indians... Our system is to live in perpetual peace with the Indians, to cultivate an affectionate attachment from them, by everything just &amp; liberal which we can do for them within the bounds of reason, and by giving them effectual protection against wrongs from our own people. The decrease of game rendering their subsistence by hunting insufficient, we wish to draw them to agriculture, to spinning &amp; weaving... when they withdraw themselves to the culture of a small piece of land, they will perceive how useless to them are their extensive forests, and will be willing to pare them off from time to time in exchange for necessaries for their farms &amp; families. At our trading houses too we mean to sell so low as merely to repay us cost and charges so as neither to lessen or enlarge our capital. this is what private traders cannot do, for they must gain; they will consequently retire from the competition, &amp; we shall thus get clear of this pest without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians. in this way our settlements will gradually circumbscribe &amp; approach the Indians, &amp; they will in time either incorporate with us as citizens of the U.S. or remove beyond the Mississippi.&quot;Noted by Law Scholar and professor Robert J. Miller, Thomas Jefferson &quot;Understood and utilized the Doctrine of Discovery [aka Manifest destiny] through his political careers and was heavily involved in using the Doctrine against Indian tribes.&quot; Jefferson was &quot;often immersed in Indian affairs through his legal and political careers&quot; and &quot;was also well acquainted with the process Virginia governments had historically used to extinguish Indian [land] titles&quot;. Jefferson used this knowledge to make the Louisiana purchase in 1803, aided in the construction of the Indian Removal Policy, and laid the ground work for removing Native American tribes further and further into eventual small reservation territories.

The idea of &quot;Indian removal&quot; gained traction in the context of manifest destiny and, with Jefferson as one of the main political voices on the subject, accumulated advocates who believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from white settlers. The removal effort was further solidified through policy by Andrew Jackson when he signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830. In his First Annual Message to Congress in 1829, Jackson stated with regards to removal: I suggest for your consideration the propriety of setting apart an ample district west of the Mississippi, and without the limits of any state or territory now formed, to be guaranteed to the Indian tribes as long as they shall occupy it, each tribe having a distinct control over the portion designated for its use. There they may be secured in the enjoyment of governments of their own choice, subject to no other control from the United States than such as may be necessary to preserve peace on the frontier and between the several tribes. There the benevolent may endeavor to teach them the arts of civilization, and, by promoting union and harmony among them, to raise up an interesting commonwealth, destined to perpetuate the race and to attest the humanity and justice of this government.&quot;

After major exploration and colonization to the western parts of the United States, resources and industry were needed to support such colonies. Colville scholar Dina Gilo-Whitaker outlines how during this process, promises of innovative technologies and abundant resources were made to indigenous people as the settlers effectively began damming rivers, imposing railways, and seeking natural resources and minerals through mining and excavation of Native American lands. According to historians Boyd Cothran and Ned Blackhawk, this influx of trade, industrialization, and development of transportation corridors killed surrounding livestock, caused waterway damage, and created sickness and disease for the Native American peoples living in those regions.

Historian Jeffery Ostler comments on some of the general theories about native American population decline due to these environmental factors. He shows that, over the course of this period, there were many forces &quot;of destruction, including enslavement, disease, material deprivation, malnutrition, and social stress.&quot;

Following the forced removal of many Indigenous Peoples, Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would eventually disappear as the United States expanded. Humanitarian advocates of removal believed that American Indians would be better off moving away from whites. As historian Reginald Horsman argued in his influential study &quot;Race and Manifest Destiny&quot;, racial rhetoric increased during the era of manifest destiny. Americans increasingly believed that Native American ways of life would &quot;fade away&quot; as the United States expanded. As an example, this idea was reflected in the work of one of America&#x27;s first great historians, Francis Parkman, whose landmark book &quot;The Conspiracy of Pontiac&quot; was published in 1851. Parkman wrote that after the French defeat in the French and Indian War, Indians were &quot;destined to melt and vanish before the advancing waves of Anglo-American power, which now rolled westward unchecked and unopposed&quot;. Parkman emphasized that the collapse of Indian power in the late 18th century had been swift and was a past event.

Indian removal policies led to the current day reservation system which allocated territories to individual tribes. According to scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, &quot;the treaties also created reservations that would confine Native people into smaller territories far smaller than they had for millenia been accustomed to, diminishing their ability to feed themselves.&quot; According to author and scholar David Rich Lewis, these reservations had much higher population densities than indigenous homelands. As a result, &quot;the consolidation of native peoples in the 19th century allowed epidemic diseases to rage through their communities.&quot; In addition to this &quot;a result of changing subsistence patterns and environments-contributed to an explosion of dietary-related illness like diabetes, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, cirrhosis, obesity, gallbladder disease, hypertension, and heart disease.&quot;

== Legacy and consequences ==
The belief in an American mission to promote and defend democracy throughout the world, as expounded by Jefferson and his &quot;Empire of Liberty&quot;, and continued by Lincoln, Wilson and George W. Bush, continues to have an influence on American political ideology. Under Douglas MacArthur, the Americans &quot;were imbued with a sense of manifest destiny,&quot; says historian John Dower.
After the turn of the 19th century to the 20th century, the phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot; declined in usage, as territorial expansion ceased to be promoted as being a part of America&#x27;s &quot;destiny&quot;. Under President Theodore Roosevelt the role of the United States in the New World was defined, in the 1904 Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine, as being an &quot;international police power&quot; to secure American interests in the Western Hemisphere. Roosevelt&#x27;s corollary contained an explicit rejection of territorial expansion. In the past, manifest destiny had been seen as necessary to enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere, but now expansionism had been replaced by interventionism as a core value associated with the doctrine.

President Wilson continued the policy of interventionism in the Americas, and attempted to redefine both manifest destiny and America&#x27;s &quot;mission&quot; on a broader, worldwide scale. Wilson led the United States into World War I with the argument that &quot;The world must be made safe for democracy.&quot; In his 1920 message to Congress after the war, Wilson stated:
... I think we all realize that the day has come when Democracy is being put upon its final test. The Old World is just now suffering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitution of the principle of autocracy as asserted in the name, but without the authority and sanction, of the multitude. This is the time of all others when Democracy should prove its purity and its spiritual power to prevail. It is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead in the attempt to make this spirit prevail.

This was the only time a president had used the phrase &quot;manifest destiny&quot; in his annual address. Wilson&#x27;s version of manifest destiny was a rejection of expansionism and an endorsement (in principle) of self-determination, emphasizing that the United States had a mission to be a world leader for the cause of democracy. This U.S. vision of itself as the leader of the &quot;Free World&quot; would grow stronger in the 20th century after the end of World War II, although rarely would it be described as &quot;manifest destiny&quot;, as Wilson had done.

&quot;Manifest destiny&quot; is sometimes used by critics of U.S. foreign policy to characterize interventions in the Middle East and elsewhere. In this usage, &quot;manifest destiny&quot; is interpreted as the underlying cause of what is denounced by some as &quot;American imperialism&quot;. A more positive-sounding phrase devised by scholars at the end of the 20th century is &quot;nation building&quot;, and State Department official Karin Von Hippel notes that the U.S. has &quot;been involved in nation-building and promoting democracy since the middle of the 19th century and &#x27;Manifest Destiny.

=== Environmental consequences for indigenous peoples ===
Many studies suggest environmental changes that directly impact Indigenous communities due to the result of European colonization and settlement, according to scholar Dina Gilio-Whitaker, when manifest destiny reached California and Oregon, &quot;Waters were diverted, interrupting farming practices: ancient food sources are eliminated: tribal self-determination was compromised with dams built on treaty adds: entire ecosystems were altered, interrupting cultural practices and dividing families: trauma inflicted by disruptions contributed to failing health conditions in tribal communities.&quot;

Further, &quot;sudden loss of salmon-based economies and spiritual traditions was a seismic shock to cultures and psyches of the people who collectively call themselves Salmon People.&quot; &quot;Specifically, &#x27;The Karuk are a fishing people who have sustainably managed their Klamath River fishery through the use of ceremony and harvest techniques for tens of thousands of years. Since the arrival of non-Indians in the 1850s, however, the salmon populations have been damaged by overfishing and the degradation of their habitat.&quot; &quot;Scholars such as environmental sociologist Kari Norgaard have shown that these issues continue into the present moment: &quot;Ron Reed served as the Karuk tribal representative for the relicensing process. Reed became convinced that the lack of healthy food, specifically the loss of salmon, was directly affecting the health of his people, leading to high rates of diabetes, heart disease, and a decreased life expectancy.&quot;

Other environmental changes as a result of European settlement were discovered as a result of the pre-industrial era, according to historian Boyd Cothran, &quot;It coincided with a national timber boom and the concurrent near exhaustion of the Great Lakes forests, leading American businesses to clamor for access to the vast timber stands located on many western Indian Reservations.&quot;

Biomolecular archaeologist Eric J. Guiry has shown that this deforestation had increasingly negative effects on Great Lakes ecosystems: &#x27;in comparison with the industrial era...&quot;Aquatic disruptions in great lakes have been linked to timber extraction through the loss of ecological resources. &quot;Results show that, in comparison with the industrial era, the nitrogen cycle and trophic structure of the Great Lakes ecosystems remained remarkably stable until the 1830s, despite millennia of Indigenous agricultural and other land management, decades of European settlement, and climatic fluctuations. After this time, increased logging from forestry and agriculture induced soil erosion caused an unprecedented and abrupt bottom-up shift throughout the entire aquatic ecosystem of Lake Ontario.&quot;

== Criticisms ==

Critics have condemned manifest destiny as an ideology used to justify dispossession and genocide against indigenous peoples. Critics argue it resulted in the forceful settler-colonial displacement of Indigenous Americans in order to carry out colonial expansion.

Critics at the time of the country&#x27;s growing desire for expansion doubted the country&#x27;s ability to rule such an extensive empire.

<text>Holmfirth () is a town in the Metropolitan Borough of Kirklees, West Yorkshire, England. It is located south of Huddersfield and west of Barnsley; the boundary of the Peak District National Park is to the south-west. The town is sited on the A635 and A6024 roads in the Holme Valley, at the confluence of the River Holme and Ribble. It mostly consists of stone-built cottages nestled on the eastern slopes of the Pennine hills. 

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Holmfirth was a centre for pioneering film-making by Bamforth &amp; Co., which later switched to the production of saucy seaside postcards. Between 1973 and 2010, Holmfirth and the Holme Valley became well known as the filming location of the BBC&#x27;s situation comedy &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. In 2023, the filming location of Sid&#x27;s Cafe in the town centre was preserved.

==History==
The name &quot;Holmfirth&quot; derives from Old English &quot;holegn&quot; (&#x27;holly&#x27;), in the name of Holme, West Yorkshire, compounded with Middle English &quot;frith&quot; (&#x27;wood&#x27;). It thus meant &#x27;the woods at Holme&#x27;.

The town originally grew up around a corn mill and bridge in the 13th century. Three hundred years later Holmfirth expanded rapidly as the growing cloth trade grew, and the production of stone and slates from the surrounding quarries increased. The present parish church was built in 1778 after the church built in 1476 was swept away in a flood the previous year. Dr Albert Lister Peace was the church&#x27;s organist, at the age of nine, in the early 1850s. In 1850 Holmfirth railway station opened, on the branch line built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company.

Local men who served and died in the First and Second World Wars are commemorated on the Holme Valley War Memorial found outside Holme Valley Memorial Hospital.

===Bamforth &amp; Co===
Holmfirth was the home of Bamforth &amp; Co Ltd, who were well known for their cheeky seaside postcards – although around the time of the First World War, they produced postcards of a more sober nature. The printing works on Station Road has now been converted into residential flats.

Bamforth&#x27;s company were early pioneers of film-making, before they abandoned the business in favour of postcards. During the early 1900s Holmfirth was well known for film making; During the periods 1898–1900 and 1913–1915 Bamforth and Co. produced what the British Film Institute describes as &#x27;a modest but historically significant collection of films&#x27;.

===Flooding===

There are a number of instances when flooding has occurred in the Holme Valley affecting Holmfirth and other settlements in the valley. The earliest recorded Holmfirth flood was in 1738 and the most recent was 1944. The most severe flood occurred early on the morning of 5 February 1852, when the embankment of the Bilberry Reservoir collapsed causing the deaths of 81 people. Following a severe storm in 1777 the River Holme burst its banks, sweeping away people and property with the loss of three lives; the stone church built in 1476, was also swept away. A storm in 1821 again caused the river to burst its banks. The flooding on the night of 29 May 1944 was not nationally reported and it was then overshadowed by the D-Day landings the following week.

==Description==
Holmfirth (and the surrounding countryside) is the setting for the BBC&#x27;s long-running comedy &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. Thousands of tourists flock to the area each year to enjoy scenery and locations familiar from the series. Filming of the TV Slaithwaite-based drama, &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot;, had also taken place in and around the area.

The former Lodge&#x27;s supermarket building had been sitting empty in the heart of the town since the Co-op moved to new premises in Crown Bottom. Lodge&#x27;s was built in the 1970s by the prominent local grocery company. It was opened by Radio 1 DJ Tony Blackburn and occupied an unusual location over the River Holme beside the town&#x27;s small bus station. Lodge&#x27;s was bought in the 1990s by Co-operative Retail Services who eventually closed the store down in 1997, after investing in a brand new £2 million supermarket for the town. Local residents, led by the Holme Valley Business Association, campaigned for its demolition. Their campaign was featured in the 2005 Channel 4 documentary, &quot;Demolition&quot;. The building has since been converted into several smaller shops, including a Sainsbury&#x27;s Local, with some accommodation on the top floor.

==Governance==
Until 1974, the area was administered by Holmfirth Urban District Council which was based at the Council Offices in Huddersfield Road in Holmfirth. Since then, Holmfirth has been administered by Kirklees Council. At the lowest tier the local parish council is Holme Valley Parish Council.

==Education==
===Primary education===

==Economy==
Holmfirth&#x27;s economy is dominated by rural and tourism activities. A 2013 youth survey identified reducing opportunities for young adults in the area and an intention to leave to find employment. The survey resulted in a successful bid for lottery funding to create new opportunities and training to increase employment opportunities in the area. Tourism economic activity is increasing with several accommodation and tourist pursuits developing in the town including booking software to manage and market accommodation. New holiday accommodation includes that linked to the new Winery in Cartworth Moor.

Longley Farm, founded in 1948, manufacturer of dairy products, is a significant employer in the town.

===Railway===

The town was previously served by Holmfirth railway station, which was at the end of a short branch line, which diverged from the Penistone Line just south of Brockholes. A viaduct took the line across the valley and into Thongsbridge where another station was sited. The line then went along the side of the valley coming to a halt just outside the town centre on Station Road. Plans did exist for the line to be extended up the valley and then tunnel under Black Hill to join the Woodhead line between and . The line closed to passengers in 1959, with goods traffic lasting until 1965. Holmfirth&#x27;s station building and platform still remain as a private house. Other sections of the line further down the valley have been sold off for private housing and the viaduct, crossing the valley from the A616 (New Mill Road), at Brockholes, over Spring Wood, has been demolished.

The station was presided over and maintained by a groundskeeper, Cecil Walker, between the years 1850 and 1879, when he retired and maintenance responsibilities were transferred to the council.

<text>Dame Thora Hird (28 May 1911 – 15 March 2003) was an English actress. In a career spanning over 70 years, she appeared in more than 100 films, as well as many television roles, becoming a household name and a British institution.

Hird was a three-time winner of the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress, for &quot;Talking Heads: A Cream Cracker Under the Settee&quot; (1989), &quot;Talking Heads: Waiting for the Telegram&quot; (1999) and &quot;Lost for Words&quot; (2000). She also received a BAFTA Special Award in 1994. Her film credits included &quot;The Love Match&quot; (1955), &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960), &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962) and &quot;The Nightcomers&quot; (1971).

== Early life and career ==
Hird was born on 28 May 1911 in the Lancashire seaside town of Morecambe to James Henry Hird and Jane Mary (née Mayor). Her family background was largely theatrical: her mother had been an actress, while her father managed a number of entertainment venues in Morecambe, including the Royalty Theatre, where Hird made her first appearance, and the West End Pier. Thora first appeared on stage in 1911 at the age of two months in a play her father was managing, carried on stage in her mother&#x27;s arms. She worked at the local Co-operative store before joining the Morecambe Repertory Theatre.

Hird often described her father, who initially did not want her to be an actress, as her sternest critic and attributed much of her talent as an actress and comedian to his guidance. In 1944 she made her West End debut in the Esther McCracken play &quot;No Medals&quot;.

Although Hird left Morecambe in the late 1940s, she retained her affection for the town, referring to herself as a &quot;sand grown &#x27;un&quot;, the colloquial term for anyone born in Morecambe.

Initially, Hird made regular appearances in films, including the wartime propaganda film &quot;Went the Day Well?&quot; (1942, known as &quot;48 Hours&quot; in the USA), in which she is shown wielding a rifle to defend a house from German paratroopers. She worked with the British film comedian Will Hay and featured in &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960), which starred Laurence Olivier, as well as &quot;A Kind of Loving&quot; (1962) with Alan Bates and June Ritchie.

Hird gained her highest profile in television comedy, notably the sitcoms &quot;Meet the Wife&quot; (1963–66), &quot;In Loving Memory&quot; (1979–86), &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; (1983–84) and, for nearly two decades, as Edie Pegden in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; (1986–2003). Hird played a variety of roles, including the nurse in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, and won BAFTA Best Actress awards for her roles in two of Alan Bennett&#x27;s &quot;Talking Heads&quot; monologues.

Hird starred as Captain Emily Ridley in the sitcom &quot;Hallelujah!&quot; (1983–84) about the Salvation Army, a movement which she supported throughout her life. Hird also portrayed Mrs Speck, the housekeeper of the Mayor of Gloucester, in &quot;The Tailor of Gloucester&quot; (1989).

In 1993 she played Annie Longden, mother of Deric Longden in &quot;Wide-Eyed and Legless&quot; (known as &quot;The Wedding Gift&quot; outside the UK) and reprised her role in the 1999 TV film &quot;Lost for Words&quot;, which won her a BAFTA for Best Actress.

== Religious broadcasts ==
Hird was a committed Christian, hosting the religious programmes &quot;Your Songs of Praise Choice&quot; (1979–1983) and &quot;Praise Be!&quot; (1984–1993), a spin-off from &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; on the BBC. Her work for charity and on television in spite of old age and ill health made her an institution. Her advertisements for Churchill stairlifts also kept her in the public eye.

== Honours ==
She was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1983 Birthday Honours and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in the 1993 Birthday Honours. She received an honorary D.Litt. from Lancaster University in 1989.

== Later life ==
In December 1998, using a wheelchair, Hird played a brief but energetic cameo role as the mother of Dolly on &quot;Dinnerladies&quot;, a sarcastic character who was particularly bitter towards her daughter.

Her final acting work was for BBC Radio 7, which was recorded in 2002 and broadcast some months after her death: a monologue written for her by Alan Bennett entitled &quot;The Last of the Sun&quot;, in which she played a forthright, broad-minded woman, immobile in an old people&#x27;s home but still able to take a stand against the censorious and politically correct attitudes of her own daughter.

== &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; ==
She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions: in January 1964 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews, and in December 1996, when Michael Aspel surprised her while filming on location for &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Hird married musician James Scott in 1937. They had a daughter, actress Janette Scott, in 1938. Hird was mother-in-law to jazz singer Mel Tormé for eleven years. Hird was widowed in 1994, having been married for 57 years.

Hird underwent a heart bypass operation in 1992. She suffered from severe osteoarthritis, had repeated hip replacements and used a wheelchair in her later life. 

== Death ==
Hird died on 15 March 2003 aged 91, following a stroke. A memorial service was held on 15 September 2003 at Westminster Abbey attended by more than 2,000 people, including Alan Bennett, Sir David Frost, Melvyn Bragg and Victoria Wood.

In July 2019, a commemorative blue plaque to Thora Hird was installed by The Theatre and Film Guild of Great Britain and America, at the Bayswater home where she lived for over 50 years.

<text>The Côtes-d&#x27;Armor ( , ; ; , ), formerly known as Côtes-du-Nord until 1990 (, ), is a department in the north of Brittany, in northwestern France. In 2019, it had a population of 600,582.

==History==

Côtes-du-Nord was one of the original 83 departments created on 4 March 1790 following the French Revolution. It was made up from the near entirety of the ancient Pays de Saint-Brieuc, most of historical Trégor, the eastern half of Cornouaille, and the north-western part of the former diocese of Saint-Malo.

On 27 February 1990, the name was changed to Côtes-d&#x27;Armor: the French word &quot;côtes&quot; means &quot;coasts&quot; and &quot;ar mor&quot; is &quot;the sea&quot; in Breton. The name also recalls that of the Roman province of Armorica (&quot;the coastal region&quot;).

==Geography==
Côtes-d&#x27;Armor is part of the current administrative region of Brittany and is bounded by the departments of 
Ille-et-Vilaine to the east, Morbihan to the south, and Finistère to the west, and by the English Channel to the north.

The region is an undulating plateau including three well-marked ranges of hills in the south. A granitoid chain, the Monts du Méné, starting in the south-east of the department runs in a north-westerly direction, forming the watershed between the rivers running respectively to the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. Towards its western extremity this chain bifurcates to form the Montagnes Noires in the south-west and the Monts d&#x27;Arrée in the west of the department. Off the coast, which is steep, rocky and much indented, are the Jentilez, Bréhat and other small islands. The principal bays are those of Saint-Malo and Saint-Brieuc.

===Principal towns===

The most populous commune is Saint-Brieuc, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:

==Demographics==
The inhabitants of the department are known in French as &quot;Costarmoricains&quot;.
==Politics==

Côtes-d&#x27;Armor&#x27;s long tradition of anti-clericalism, especially in the interior around Guingamp (a former Communist stronghold), has often led to the department&#x27;s being seen as an area of left-wing exceptionalism in a region that historically was otherwise strongly Catholic and right-wing. The current president of the departmental council, Christian Coail, is a member of the Socialist Party.

===Current National Assembly Representatives===

==Culture==
The western part of the department is part of the traditionally Breton-speaking &quot;Lower Brittany&quot; (&quot;Breizh-Izel&quot; in Breton). The boundary runs from Plouha to Mûr-de-Bretagne. The Breton language has become an intense issue in many parts of Brittany, and many Breton-speakers advocate for bilingual schools. Gallo is also spoken in the east and is offered as a language in the schools and on the baccalaureat exams.

<text>NAPLPS (North American Presentation Level Protocol Syntax) is a graphics language for use originally with videotex and teletext services. NAPLPS was developed from the Telidon system developed in Canada, with a small number of additions from AT&amp;T Corporation. The basics of NAPLPS were later used as the basis for several other microcomputer-based graphics systems.

== History ==
The Canadian Communications Research Centre (CRC), based in Ottawa, had been working on various graphics systems since the late 1960s, much of it led by Herb Bown. Through the 1970s they turned their attention to building out a system of &quot;picture description instructions&quot;, which encoded graphics commands as a text stream.

Graphics were encoded as a series of instructions (graphics primitives) each represented by a single ASCII character. Graphic coordinates were encoded in multiple 6-bit strings of XY coordinate data, flagged to place them in the printable ASCII range so that they could be transmitted with conventional text transmission techniques. ASCII SI/SO characters were used to differentiate the text from graphic portions of a transmitted &quot;page&quot;. These instructions were decoded by separate programs to produce graphics output, on a plotter for instance. Other work produced a fully interactive version. In 1975, the CRC gave a contract to Norpak to develop an interactive graphics terminal that could decode the instructions and display them on a color display.

During this period, a number of companies were developing the first teletext systems, notably the BBC&#x27;s Ceefax system. Ceefax encoded character data into the lines in the vertical blanking interval of normal television signals where they could not be seen on-screen, and then used a buffer and decoder in the user&#x27;s television to convert these into &quot;pages&quot; of text on the display. The Independent Broadcasting Authority quickly introduced their own ORACLE system, and the two organizations subsequently agreed to use a single standard, the &quot;Broadcast Teletext Specification&quot;. This later became World System Teletext.

At about the same time, other organizations were developing videotex systems, similar to teletext except they used modems to transmit their data instead of television signals. This was potentially slower and used up a telephone line, but had the major advantage of allowing the user to transmit data back to the sender. The UK&#x27;s General Post Office developed a system using the Ceefax/ORACLE standard, launching it as Prestel, while France prepared the first steps for its ultimately very successful Minitel system, using a rival display standard called Antiope.

By 1977, the Norpak system was running, and from this work the CRC decided to create their own teletext/videotext system. Unlike the systems being rolled out in Europe, the CRC decided from the start that the system should be able to run on any combination of communications links. For instance, it could use the vertical blanking interval to send data to the user, and a modem to return selections to the servers. It could be used in a one-way or two-way system.

In teletext mode, character codes were sent to users&#x27; televisions by encoding them as dot patterns in the vertical blanking interval of the video signal. Various technical &quot;tweaks&quot; and details of the NTSC signals used by North American televisions allowed the downstream videotex channel to increase to 600 bit/s, about twice that used in the European systems. In videotext mode, Bell 202 modems were typical, offering a 1,200 bit/s download rate. A set top box attached to the TV decoded these signals back into text and graphics pages, which the user could select among. 

The system was publicly launched as Telidon on August 15, 1978. Compared to the European standards, the CRC system was faster, bi-directional, and offered real graphics as opposed to simple character graphics. The downside of the system was that it required much more advanced decoders, typically featuring Zilog Z80 or Motorola 6809 processors with RGB and/or RF output. The Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (then Department of Communications) launched a four-year plan to fund public roll-outs of the technology in an effort to spur the development of a commercial Telidon system.

AT&amp;T Corporation was so impressed by Telidon that they decided to join the project. They added a number of useful extensions, notably the ability to define original graphics commands (&quot;macro&quot;) and character sets (&quot;DRCS&quot;). They also tabled algorithms for proportionally spaced text, which greatly improved the quality of the displayed pages. A joint CSA/ANSI working group (X3L2.1) revised the specifications, which were submitted for standardization. In 1983, they became CSA T500 and ANSI X3.110, or NAPLPS. The data encoding system was also standardized as the NABTS (North American Broadcast Teletext Specification) protocol.

Business models for Telidon services were poorly developed. Unlike the UK, where teletext was supported by one of only two large companies whose whole revenue model was based on a read-only medium (television), in North America Telidon was being offered by companies who worked on a subscriber basis.

== One-way systems ==

Telidon-based teletext was tested in a few North American trials in the early 1980s — CBC IRIS, TVOntario, MTS-sponsored Project IDA, to name a few.

NAPLPS was also part of the NABTS teletext standard, for the encoding and display of teletext pages.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, affiliates of the regional sports network group SportsChannel ran a service called Sports Plus Network, which ran sports news and scores while SportsChannel was not otherwise on the air. The screens, which frequently featured team logos or likenesses of players in addition to text, were drawn entirely with NAPLPS graphics and resembled the loading of Prodigy pages over a modem, though slightly faster.

== Two-way systems ==

Various two-way systems using NAPLPS appeared in North America in the early 1980s. The biggest North American examples were Knight Ridder&#x27;s Viewtron (based in Miami) and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Gateway service (based in Orange County). Both used the Sceptre NAPLPS terminal from AT&amp;T. The Sceptre contained a slow modem that connected over the consumer&#x27;s telephone line to host computers. The Sceptre was expensive whether purchased or rented. Despite huge investments by their parent companies, neither Viewtron nor Gateway lasted into the second half of the decade. Another system, Keyfax, was developed by Keycom Electronic Publishing, a joint venture of Honeywell, Centel (since acquired by Sprint) and Field Enterprises, then-owner of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; newspaper. Keyfax had originally been a WST teletext service, broadcast overnights on Field&#x27;s Chicago television station WFLD-32 and through the VBI of both WFLD and national superstation WTBS; the decision was made to convert Keyfax into a subscription service, using a proprietary NAPLPS terminal device in a last-ditch effort to save the service. It did not work and Keyfax had ceased operations by the end of 1986.

Other early-1980s NAPLPS technology was deployed in Canada, both as a way for rural Canadians to get news and weather information and as the platform for touchscreen information kiosks. In Vancouver these were featured at Expo 86. The kiosks became ubiquitous in Toronto under the name &quot;Teleguide,&quot; and were deployed in many shopping centres and at major tourist attractions. The latter city was the North American nexus of NAPLPS and the home of Norpak, the most successful of NAPLPS-oriented developers. Norpak created and sold hardware and software for NAPLPS development and display. TVOntario also developed NAPLPS content creation software.

London, Ontario - based Cableshare used NAPLPS as the basis of touch-screen information kiosks for shopping malls, the flagship of which was deployed at Toronto&#x27;s Eaton Centre. The system relied on an 8085-based microcomputer which drove several NAPLPS terminals fitted with touch screens, all communicating via Datapac to a back end database. The system offered news, weather and sports information along with shopping mall guides and coupons. Cableshare also developed and sold a leading NAPLPS page creation utility called the &quot;Picture Painter.&quot;

In the late 1980s, Tribune Media Services (TMS) and the Associated Press operated a cable television channel called AP News Plus that provided NAPLPS-based news screens to cable television subscribers in many U.S. cities. The news pages were created and edited by TMS staffers working on an Atex editing system in Orlando, Florida, and sent by satellite to NAPLPS decoder devices located at the local cable television companies. Among the firms providing technology to TMS and the Associated Press for the AP News Plus channel was Minneapolis-based Electronic Publishers Inc. (1985–1988).

In 1981, two amateur radio operators (VE3FTT and VE3GQW) received special permission from the Canadian Department of Communications to carry out on-air experiments using NAPLPS syntax which was technically not legal at the time because it was a &quot;coded transmission&quot;. Following their report on the success of the tests, the DOC then permitted general use of NAPLPS on amateur radioteletype. This was reported in the ARRL Radio Handbook for several years following.

Between 1988 and 1994, Bell Canada offered a dial-up Telidon service called Alex, similar in spirit to the French Minitel, with the telephone directory its principal information offering.

== Decline ==
NAPLPS lived on into the early 1990s as the graphical basis for the Prodigy online service. Some bulletin boards were able to serve NAPLPS content to callers on their 1200 and 2400 bit/s modems. But the technology&#x27;s chief advantage in an era of slow telecommunication - its ability to encode complex graphics in terse object commands - became moot as data communication speeds increased and raster graphics compression became popular.

== Legacy ==
In the 1980s, the Graphical Kernel System (GKS) library, based on a 1970s specification with a similar basic geometry and command structure to NAPLPS, was widely implemented on microcomputers, and became the basis of Digital Research&#x27;s GSX graphics system used in their GEM GUI. GKS was later extended into a 3D version, and additions to this resulted in PHIGS (Programmer&#x27;s Hierarchical Interactive Graphics System), a competitor to OpenGL.

<doc id="90677" wikidata="Q4984835" url="?curid=90677" title="Buddy Cole (character)">
<text>Charles Budderick &quot;Buddy&quot; Cole is a fictional character created and portrayed by Canadian actor-comedian Scott Thompson. He is an effeminate, gay socialite, made famous on &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, a popular Canadian sketch comedy series starring the troupe of the same name. The character also had a recurring role on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;. He was loosely based on one of Thompson&#x27;s romantic partners.

==Fictional biography==
According to the book &quot;Buddy Babylon&quot;, Cole was the youngest of 23 children born to pig farmers in Saint-Hubert-sur-le-Lac, Quebec. His hard-partying lifestyle once led him into a brief lavender marriage with a Hollywood actress named Tandy; from that marriage, he is stepfather to conjoined twins named Suzanne and Pleshette.

Buddy owns a gay bar, Buddy&#x27;s, which he purchased with money saved during a brief stint of not smoking cigarettes.

According to the &quot;Chalet 2000&quot; episode of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, a full-length adventure starring Buddy and friends, Buddy is the nephew of comedian Rip Taylor.

== On &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; ==
Most of Buddy Cole&#x27;s appearances in &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; are monologues delivered from his gay bar, Buddy&#x27;s. These monologues tend to involve reflections on his personal life and the gay community. He also frequently drops celebrity names, insinuating that he has many close friendships with the rich and famous. A series of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; sketches portrayed his deeply personal relationship with Queen Elizabeth II (also played by Thompson).

During the second season of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, Buddy began to star in more action-packed sketches. In the first such appearance, he becomes the substitute coach of a lesbian softball team. From there on, his adventures became more outrageous and surreal, from accidentally murdering a drag queen (while on a bad acid trip) to purchasing his very own male slave in the 1950s.

In the series&#x27; final episode, he is one in a handful of characters to get something of a resolution: Having lost his bar in a game of strip poker (he refused to remove his shirt having just put on ten pounds), he burns it down in order to win back his old boyfriend - &quot;a firefighter from Buffalo&quot;. Also, in the last sketch is a childhood photo of Kurt Cobain (an acquaintance of Thompson&#x27;s), sitting on the bar as it burns down.

== After the TV series ==
Following the conclusion of the television series in 1995, Buddy Cole made regular appearances in Scott Thompson&#x27;s one-man stage show. Buddy has been one of many characters revived for &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot; reunion tours; he did not, however, appear in the troupe&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Kids in the Hall: Brain Candy&quot; or their 2010 reunion miniseries &quot;The Kids in the Hall: Death Comes to Town&quot;. He did appear in a sketch in the 2022 Amazon Prime revival of &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;, reminiscing about the changes in the gay village over the years as he walks down the street with a friend, before they unexpectedly come across the last remaining glory hole.

In 1994, Thompson appeared in character as Buddy Cole in Bruce LaBruce&#x27;s film &quot;Super 8½&quot;.

In 1998, Thompson and Paul Bellini co-authored the book &quot;Buddy Babylon: The Autobiography of Buddy Cole&quot;.

In early 2006, Breakthrough Entertainment, the producers of the series &quot;Atomic Betty&quot; and &quot;Paradise Falls&quot;, announced that an animated comedy series based on the character was in development. &quot;Buddy&#x27;s&quot; was expected to air on CBC Television and the American LGBT channel Here!. However, in a February 1, 2007 interview on &quot;Tom Green Live&quot;, Thompson announced that the series was no longer in development. No reason for the dissolution of the show was given, but Thompson did say that Buddy Cole now had his own blog instead, written and updated by Thompson himself.

On January 13, 2008, Thompson posted a video blog as Cole. However, it was also his last; as announced in the video (titled &quot;Adieu to EWE&quot;), Cole simply did not have enough time to blog.

In February 2014, Thompson appeared in character as Buddy Cole on several episodes of &quot;The Colbert Report&quot;, serving as the program&#x27;s correspondent to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. His coverage focused on Russia&#x27;s anti-gay laws, including interviewing openly gay Ambassador Daniel Baer of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

In 2018, Thompson toured the stage show &quot;Après Le Déluge: The Buddy Cole Monologues&quot;, and released a new reprint of &quot;Buddy Babylon&quot;.

In 2022, he appeared Netflix&#x27;s LGBTQ+ comedy special hosted by Billy Eichner &quot;Stand Out: An LGBTQ+ Celebration&quot; along with Bob the Drag Queen, Mae Martin, Margaret Cho, Trixie Mattel, Joel Kim Booster, Sam Jay, Tig Notaro, Gina Yashere, Matteo Lane, Eddie Izzard, Marsha Warfield, Patti Harrison, Guy Branum, Solomon Georgio, Judy Gold, Wanda Sykes, Lily Tomlin, and Sandra Bernhard.

==Reception==
Thompson has described Buddy as a &quot;butch queen&quot; and an &quot;alpha fag&quot;, pointing out that while extremely effeminate, Buddy is also very forceful and strong willed. Thompson, who is openly gay, has always directly confronted charges that Buddy is a homophobic stereotype. &quot;The whole idea of Buddy Cole being considered a terrible stereotype and a terrible throwback is, I think, just tragic,&quot; he told &quot;Orlando Weekly&quot; in 2000. &quot;I mean, most gay men are more Buddy than Sly.&quot;

<text>Telidon (from the Greek words τῆλε, &quot;tele&quot; &quot;at a distance&quot; and ἰδών, &quot;idon&quot; &quot;seeing&quot;) was a videotex/teletext service developed by the Canadian Communications Research Centre (CRC) during the late 1970s and supported by commercial enterprises led by Infomart in the early 1980s. Most work on the system ended after 1985, having failed to build critical mass.

The CRC referred to Telidon as a &quot;second generation&quot; videotex system, offering improved performance, 2D colour graphics, multilingual support and a number of different interactivity options supported on various hardware. With additional features added by AT&amp;T Corporation, and 16 other contributors in North America and supported by the Federal Government, Telidon was redefined as a protocol and became the NAPLPS standard.

A number of Telidon systems were rolled out, including GRASSROOTS for the Province of Manitoba, SOI for Venezuela, Compuserve, LA Times in California, EPIC for General Motors, NOVATEX for Teleglobe Canada and the Swiss PTT nationwide application. These failed to demonstrate compelling functionality, and the auxiliary equipment costs remained high. Eventually, on 31 March 1985, the Canadian government support for the project ended and the various commercial services based on it closed shortly thereafter.

Telidon saw limited use after that, in niches like informational displays in airports and similar environments. NAPLPS did appear in several other products, notably the Prodigy online service and some bulletin boards. Telidon had a lasting legacy on the hardware side; its NABTS communications system found re-use years later in WebTV for Windows.

==History==
===Genesis===
Herb Bown is widely considered to be the &quot;father&quot; of Telidon. Bown had been working in the computer graphics field since the late 1960s, originally using plotters but later moving to video systems. Starting in 1970, Bown and a team at the CRC started working on a &quot;Picture Description Instruction&quot; (PDI) format to encode vector graphics information. An interpreter, the &quot;Interactive Graphics Programming Language&quot; (IGPL), read the PDI codes and rasterized them for display. By this time the team consisted of Bown, Doug O&#x27;Brien, Bill Sawchuck, J.R. Storey and Bob Warburton.

As the work continued, the team decided that locking the system to the particular hardware they were using was not appropriate, and started modifying the PDI system to be based on alphanumeric codes instead of binary numbers. A major advantage to this approach is that the data can be sent over common communications channels instead of relying on an 8-bit clean link to the host computer. In 1975 the CRC contracted Norpak to develop an interactive colour display terminal based on the new alphanumeric PDI. The CRC had patented several of the technologies by the end of 1977; a touch-sensitive input mechanism, the basic graphics system, and the interactive graphics programming language.

By the mid-1970s several European countries were in the process of introducing videotex and teletext services. There was considerable interest within the industry, and in the media, suggesting that online services would be the &quot;next big thing&quot;. Comments to the effect that &quot;Within the next few decades, people may be able to access much of the published information in the world from their living rooms by using videotex,&quot; were common in the trade press.

The CRC was able to interest the Department of Communications (DoC), their superiors within the federal government, to fund development of their system into the basis for a videotex service. Unlike the systems being developed in Europe and in Japan, the Canadian system would offer high-quality 2D graphics, higher speed, and could be used for one-way fixed or menued displays (teletext), two-way systems based on modems (videotex), or they could combine the two, allowing information to be sent to the customer in the video signal, and returned via modem.

===Telidon development===

On 15 August 1978, the DoC (whose technical side is now part of the Industry Canada) held a press conference and formally announced the Telidon project to the public, demonstrating a large video display sending information to a minicomputer over an acoustic coupler modem. They outlined a four-year development plan that included funding for further technical development at the CRC, the production of several hundred terminals that would be lent out to industry for development studies, as well as funds for marketing and lobbying in videotex standards negotiations.

In 1979 the DoC formed the Canadian Videotex Consultative Committee to advise the Minister on ways to commercialize the CRC&#x27;s work, and develop videotext services within Canada. The committee held four meetings during the initial four-year development plan, and coordinated a number of field trials with broadcasters, telephone companies, cable television firms, manufacturers and various information providers. During the same period, the Task Force on Service to the Public was given the job of using Telidon as a way to provide public access to government information and services.

By late 1979 Norpak had developed a version of the Telidon decoder that was housed in a box about the size of a modern digital cable set top box. A menu selection keyset, about the size and shape of a contemporary calculator, connected to it using a ribbon cable. With the hardware in place, the CRC started working with telecommunications providers to test the system in production settings. Many of the major Canadian carriers expressed strong interest, and a number of test systems were ready to roll out by the early 1980s. Excitement was high; the 19 November 1981 issue of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; quoted a representative at the Canadian Computer Show and Conference in Toronto claiming that &quot;Telidon may become as commonly used as the telephone and will have just as great a social impact.&quot; They were not alone in predicting great things for the technology:

In a radio broadcast in 1980, Douglas Parkhill, the deputy minister of research at the DoC outlined some of the potential uses, from financial information, to theatre reservations, with the ability to pay and print out tickets from the system.

===Public testing===

The release of Norpac&#x27;s Telidon terminal led to announcements by broadcasters and news organizations who would be rolling out test systems starting late that year. However, a variety of delays pushed back most of these programs into 1980. The race to have the first operational deployment was won by the small town of South Headingley, just west of Winnipeg, part of an experimental system being deployed by the Manitoba Telephone System (MTS), the local cable operator.

Named for Ida Cates, Manitoba&#x27;s first woman telephone operator in the 1880s, &quot;Project Ida&quot; was part of a wider rollout of advanced cable technologies that MTS had been planning since 1978 to study ways to use up the bandwidth capabilities of newer cable systems. Services included Telidon, cable telephony, pay TV service using outdoor converters (instead of set top boxes), and low-bandwidth backchannel data services for gas and electrical billing and alarm services.

The Telidon services that formed part of Project Ida were created by Infomart, a Toronto-based company set up to provide Telidon content. It was hosted on two computers set up in Winnipeg and run by MTS, providing a 4800 baud channel to the in-home terminals. Originally scheduled for January 1980, delays pushed this back to mid-year. Ida ran until 1981, when most of the services were dropped and the cables returned to normal analog signals, although an offshoot using optical cable was carried out in Elie, rotating the terminals though many households in the area.

Ida was followed by several Canadian companies starting similar projects. In early 1980, TVOntario, the educational television channel run by the Ontario government, set up 45 terminals in the Toronto area. In April 1981, New Brunswick Telephone set up a system practically identical to Project Ida with a full suite of services, with somewhere between 20 and 100 terminals. The same month, Alberta Government Telephones started &quot;Project VIDON&quot;, a smaller modem-based test in the Calgary area. A month later, Bell Canada announced their &quot;Vista&quot; project in Toronto and Montreal, in partnership with the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and the &quot;Southam Press&quot; who would provide content. This test eventually expanded to between 500 and 1000 terminals.

Telidon generated interest outside Canada as well. A major foreign sale was made in July 1980 to the government of Venezuela, who set up a test system to provide information on health, social and economic aid programs to people moving into Caracas from rural areas.

A number of U.S. companies also expressed an interest, and started plans for their own Telidon-based teletext systems. As early as 1978, AT&amp;T Corporation and CBS had been experimenting with the idea of a videotex service, and were drawn towards the Telidon efforts. In 1982 they introduced an experimental system known as &quot;Venture One&quot; in Ridgewood, New Jersey, equipping some homes with standalone terminals from AT&amp;T, and others with set-top boxes. The test ran for seven months from 1982 to 83, and was considered a success, so much so that AT&amp;T publicly announced plans to introduce a commercial system in 1984.

General Motors&#x27; EPIC Project used special user access kiosks with video-disk based motion video and sound integrated with Teldion data arriving from the data center in Flint, Michigan. Kiosks were distributed to hundreds of shopping malls and Buick dealers in various states. Users were able to leave their addresses for future contact, request car brochures or explore all technical and visual data with motion and sound to see all the car models available. This particular project was the single largest sale of Telidon in North America and allowed users to examine car models without speaking with a car salesperson.

===Telidon becomes NAPLPS===

AT&amp;T started a standardization effort with Bell and the DoC. AT&amp;T contributed two major additions to the system; the ability to define your own character sets, and the ability to wrap up multiple graphics commands into a &quot;macro&quot;. The former provided not only or international characters, but also for the creation of small graphics that could be sent with a low transmission cost, which is useful in certain roles where the graphics can be arranged in a grid, like a chessboard. The later allowed the programmers to create a commonly used graphical element, the AT&amp;T logo for instance, and save it to a macro. The graphic can then be recreated with a single instruction in any page that needed it.

The resulting system emerged in early 1983 as NAPLPS, while the transmission method that encoded information into the vertical blank interrupt of a TV signal became the NABTS standard. Major articles in &quot;Byte Magazine&quot; introduced the NAPLPS system to a wider audience, spread over a four-month period in the February, March, April, and May 1983 issues. With the standard complete, the U.S. teletext plans started moving forward. NAPLPS&#x27; ability to draw complex graphics was particularly interesting to U.S. information vendors such as Compuserve, as it allowed them to draw network or advertiser logos.

By this point the technical development of Telidon was complete, and that portion of the Canadian government&#x27;s involvement wound down in the summer of 1983. Further efforts were aimed at helping develop a commercial marketplace for Telidon systems and content, running for another year.

===Commercial efforts===
One of the longest-lived Telidon deployments was &quot;Project Grassroots&quot;, a follow-on to the services developed as part of the earlier Project Ida and run on its machines in Winnipeg. Unlike Ida, Grassroots ran on geographically distributed modems instead of cable links and was aimed specifically at farmers, providing weather reports, agrochemicals notices and other information, as well as optional links to live commodities pricing on various exchanges. Prices were high: in addition to purchasing a terminal there was an additional one-time $100 set-up fee, the annual fee was $150, and there was a $19.00/hr charge to connect to the service, and another $6.00/hr for &quot;communications&quot;. Nevertheless, Grassroots grew into a system that distributed 20,000 pages of information to farmers created by Infomart. Based in Winnipeg, Grassroots expanded to serve Alberta, Saskatchewan, northern Ontario, and in 1985, the northern United States.

A significant showcase for the Telidon system was set up for the Third General Assembly of the Inuit Circumpolar Council, hosted in Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island in July 1983. A database of information about the conference and its services was hosted by Teleglobe Canada in Toronto on their Novatex system, with the information translated into English, French, Danish, Inuktitut, Greenlandic, Labradorian, Inupiag, Yupik and Western Arctic. Sixteen Telidon terminals, supplied by Microtel, were located at various sites in Frobisher Bay, with additional terminals in Vancouver, Washington, D.C., Copenhagen, Anchorage, Bethel, Utqiagvik, Nuuk, as well as other northern communities. Communications were provided by Bell Canada, Teleglobe, Greenland Telecommunications and the Danish Post and Telegraph.

The Canadian government also invested in Telidon as a way of distributing graphical information. Transport Canada ran a system called &quot;TABS&quot; that installed terminals in many airports, where pilots could quickly look up weather information and NOTAMs. Statistics Canada also used Telidon as a way to distribute graphs and other information in their CANSIM system using their TELICHART software that converted tables of data into NAPLPS commands. Environment Canada used Telidon terminals to produce video feeds that could then be broadcast on local cable feeds.

In the Toronto area, &quot;Teleguide&quot; terminals were common fixtures at larger shopping malls, government buildings (e.g. Scarborough Civic Centre) and notably the Toronto Eaton Centre. Run by London, Ontario&#x27;s Cableshare, the system relied on an 8085-based microcomputer which drove several NAPLPS terminals fitted with touch screens, all communicating via Datapac to a back-end database. The system offered news, weather and sports information along with shopping mall guides and coupons. Rollouts were announced in several other cities as well.

The largest efforts were made in the United States. After the Venture One experiments in 1982/3, AT&amp;T decided not to pursue a videotex service of its own, but instead provide service and support to other companies who wanted to. CBS invested considerable capital in the development of their ExtraVision service, which also included closed captioning and channel information along with more traditional Telidon information. Affiliate stations could also insert their own content into the streams, although the high cost of the systems needed to do this made it relatively rare.

AT&amp;T also partnered with Knight-Ridder Newspapers to form Viewdata, a holding company that operated the &quot;Viewtron&quot; service. Test marketed in Florida in 1980, the service expanded to the entire southern Florida area by 1983, and then expanded to much of the eastern seaboard. Viewdata started primarily as a news service, but over time included more and more features. As it operated over modems in a pure videotex format, it was able to offer a variety of two-way services including e-mail and bulletin boards. A similar system was &quot;Gateway&quot;, run by AT&amp;T and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In 1984 Tribune Media Services (TMS) and the Associated Press operated a cable television channel called &quot;AP News Plus&quot; that provided NAPLPS-based news screens to cable television subscribers in many U.S. cities. The news pages were created and edited by TMS staffers working on an Atex editing system in Orlando, Florida, and sent by satellite to NAPLPS decoder devices located at the local cable television companies. The images were rendered locally, and then sent out as normal television signals to the customers. This avoided the need to send entire channels of video over satellite to the affiliate stations, instead, a small amount of data was sent and allowed the video to be recreated, for significantly less cost.

===Problems===

Test deployments demonstrated the problems that most other teletext systems also discovered: without an enormous amount of content, viewer interest is difficult to maintain. While large Telidon deployments might hold tens of thousands of pages, users were able to quickly exhaust the content in their particular areas of interest, suggesting that systems would have to contain hundreds of thousands of pages in order to remain interesting for longer periods. As Gordon Thompson of Bell-Northern Research put it, &quot;all of the excitement is in the expectation; the reality is really quite disappointing.&quot;

Most teletext systems, Telidon included, were created in the context of the broadcast model, where the content would be provided by large vendors and then pushed one-way to the user in a fashion similar to television or newspapers. Interactivity was generally limited to menu selections or providing information on forms (like online banking). This placed the entire burden of creating the content on the service providers and their partners, an expensive and time-consuming process. Since much of the content in question was already available on different media controlled by the same companies, teletext services also had the problem of competing with incumbent mediums that were less expensive and better developed.

Telidon was also expensive. When it was introduced the DoC expected terminals to be available for $200 to $300 by 1982, but this did not come to be. The largest suppliers of terminals were Electrohome, Norpak and Microtel, whose terminals ranged between $1,800 and $2,500. During the development period the hardware manufacturers felt that demand would drive down prices to less than $600, however, results from trials indicated that even this would be considered too expensive for the mass market.

===Telidon disappears===

By the mid-1980s, home computers with graphics capabilities similar to Telidon had already come and gone, driving prices to points far below even the simplest Telidon terminal. A generation of machines like the Macintosh, Amiga, and Atari ST were entering the market with capabilities Telidon systems could not match. At the same time, information services like CompuServe and The Source were offering a usable online experience that Telidon failed to offer.

For all of these reasons, interest in Telidon, and Videotex in general, quickly faded. One reason was the issue of continued funding which the Government hoped would come from private publishing companies such as The Globe and Mail, or The Toronto Star as most likely candidates. During the latter part of 1983 and early 1984 of the Informart CEO Dave Carlisle&#x27;s reign, private publishing corporations couldn&#x27;t find a suitable approach and this resulted in D. Carlisle&#x27;s resignation with severe impact on Infomart, the flagship of Telidon in rough seas.

The government&#x27;s funding of the Telidon efforts came to an official end on 31 March 1985, at which point $69 million had been spent not counting the revenue expended by Infomart who had made national and international sales in excess of $20M. It was estimated that another $200 million had been invested by various industry partners, $100 million of that by Bell Canada. Most of the early test systems had ended their runs by 1982, while the commercial systems persevered for a few years longer; NBC&#x27;s system ended in January 1985, and then ExtraVision, Viewtron and Gateway in March 1986. In spite of these services finding some level of consumer demand, none were able to find a pricing structure that paid for their operation while still being interesting to their consumer base.

Telidon systems continued to be used as a one-way medium for some time. A common use was to use Telidon terminals to produce video that was then broadcast for viewing as closed-circuit television signals to conventional televisions, rather than sending the digital information to terminals connected to those televisions. Systems like this were common for informational displays in airports and other public areas, as well as information displays for cable TV stations.

===Legacy===
Rather than the failure of Telidon as a promising technology or efforts made, Telidon&#x27;s seemingly slow international acceptance and North America&#x27;s sluggishness in pushing it to higher level of functionality was a topic of considerable discussion and disappointment in Canada, part of a similar and wider conversation on the entire concept of videotex that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many of the Telidon criticisms focused on the role of government in development of the systems, pushing a technology that no one really wanted.

After most of the commercial efforts had ended, NAPLPS received a fresh breath of life as the basis of the Prodigy online service. In the time between efforts like Viewtron and the launch of Prodigy in 1988, personal computers with the ability to view NAPLPS graphics with ease had become common, and modem speeds had increased to the point where the data was no longer overwhelming. After a promising start, Prodigy management invoked a series of blunders that seriously upset their customer base, and the arrival of the World Wide Web in the mid-1990s killed it off.

NABTS, the communications protocol for embedding data in the TV signal, also saw continued use after the Telidon project ended. It was widely used for closed captioning support, although not the only system available. It was also used for Microsoft&#x27;s WebTV for Windows and Intel&#x27;s Intercast. Both used custom tuners, in the form of plug-in cards for PCs, that captured the information encoded into the VBI or even an entire TV channel.

For his work on Telidon, Herb Bown received the Order of Canada and the gold medal for engineering excellence from the Association of Professional Engineers of Ontario. The Touche Ross New Perspectives Award was awarded to Herb Bown and Doug O&#x27;Brien. Bown later formed IDON Corp to develop interactive teaching materials.

<text>William James (January 11, 1842 – August 26, 1910) was an American philosopher and psychologist, and the first educator to offer a psychology course in the United States. James is considered to be a leading thinker of the late 19th century, one of the most influential philosophers of the United States, and the &quot;Father of American psychology.&quot;

Born into a wealthy family, James was the son of the Swedenborgian theologian Henry James Sr. and the brother of both the prominent novelist Henry James and the diarist Alice James. James trained as a physician and taught anatomy at Harvard, but never practiced medicine. Instead, he pursued his interests in psychology and then philosophy. He wrote widely on many topics, including epistemology, education, metaphysics, psychology, religion, and mysticism. Among his most influential books are &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;, a groundbreaking text in the field of psychology; &quot;Essays in Radical Empiricism&quot;, an important text in philosophy; and &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;, an investigation of different forms of religious experience, including theories on mind-cure.
Along with Charles Sanders Peirce, James established the philosophical school known as pragmatism, and is also cited as one of the founders of functional psychology. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; analysis, published in 2002, ranked James as the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century. A survey published in &quot;American Psychologist&quot; in 1991 ranked James&#x27;s reputation in second place, after Wilhelm Wundt, who is widely regarded as the founder of experimental psychology. James also developed the philosophical perspective known as radical empiricism. James&#x27;s work has influenced philosophers and academics such as Alan Watts, W. E. B. Du Bois, Edmund Husserl, Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty. 

== Early life ==
William James was born at the Astor House in New York City on January 11, 1842. He was the son of Henry James Sr., a noted and independently wealthy Swedenborgian theologian well acquainted with the literary and intellectual elites of his day. The intellectual brilliance of the James family milieu and the remarkable epistolary talents of several of its members have made them a subject of continuing interest to historians, biographers, and critics.

William James received an eclectic trans-Atlantic education, developing fluency in both German and French. Education in the James household encouraged cosmopolitanism. The family made two trips to Europe while William James was still a child, setting a pattern that resulted in thirteen more European journeys during his life. James wished to pursue painting, his early artistic bent led to an apprenticeship in the studio of William Morris Hunt in Newport, Rhode Island, but his father urged him to become a physician instead. Since this did not align with James&#x27;s interests, he stated that he wanted to specialize in physiology. Once he figured this was also not what he wanted to do, he then announced he was going to specialize in the nervous system and psychology. James then switched in 1861 to scientific studies at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard College.

In his early adulthood, James suffered from a variety of physical ailments, including those of the eyes, back, stomach, and skin. He was also tone deaf.
He was subject to a variety of psychological symptoms which were diagnosed at the time as neurasthenia, and which included periods of depression during which he contemplated suicide for months on end. Two younger brothers, Garth Wilkinson (Wilkie) and Robertson (Bob), fought in the American Civil War. James himself was an advocate of peace. He suggested that instead of youth serving in the military, they serve the public in a term of service, &quot;to get the childishness knocked out of them.&quot; The other three siblings (William, Henry, and Alice James) all suffered from periods of invalidism.
He took up medical studies at Harvard Medical School in 1864 (according to his brother Henry James, the author). He took a break in the spring of 1865 to join naturalist Louis Agassiz on a scientific expedition up the Amazon River, but aborted his trip after eight months, as he suffered bouts of severe seasickness and mild smallpox. His studies were interrupted once again due to illness in April 1867. He traveled to Germany in search of a cure and remained there until November 1868; at that time he was 26 years old. During this period, he began to publish; reviews of his works appeared in literary periodicals such as the &quot;North American Review&quot;.

James finally earned his MD degree in June 1869 but he never practiced medicine. What he called his &quot;soul-sickness&quot; would only be resolved in 1872, after an extended period of philosophical searching. He married Alice Gibbens in 1878. In 1882 he joined the Theosophical Society.

James&#x27;s time in Germany proved intellectually fertile, helping him find that his true interests lay not in medicine but in philosophy and psychology. Later, in 1902 he would write: &quot;I originally studied medicine in order to be a physiologist, but I drifted into psychology and philosophy from a sort of fatality. I never had any philosophic instruction, the first lecture on psychology I ever heard being the first I ever gave&quot;.

== Career == 
He interacted with a wide array of writers and scholars throughout his life, including his godfather Ralph Waldo Emerson, his godson William James Sidis, as well as Charles Sanders Peirce, Bertrand Russell, Josiah Royce, Ernst Mach, John Dewey, Macedonio Fernández, Walter Lippmann, Mark Twain, Horatio Alger, G. Stanley Hall, Henri Bergson, Carl Jung, Jane Addams and Sigmund Freud.

James spent almost all of his academic career at Harvard. He was appointed instructor in physiology for the spring 1873 term, instructor in anatomy and physiology in 1873, assistant professor of psychology in 1876, assistant professor of philosophy in 1881, full professor in 1885, endowed chair in psychology in 1889, return to philosophy in 1897, and emeritus professor of philosophy in 1907.

James studied medicine, physiology, and biology, and began to teach in those subjects, but was drawn to the scientific study of the human mind at a time when psychology was constituting itself as a science. James&#x27;s acquaintance with the work of figures like Hermann Helmholtz in Germany and Pierre Janet in France facilitated his introduction of courses in scientific psychology at Harvard University. He taught his first experimental psychology course at Harvard in the 1875–1876 academic year.

During his Harvard years, James joined in philosophical discussions and debates with Charles Peirce, Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Chauncey Wright that evolved into a lively group informally known as The Metaphysical Club in 1872. Louis Menand (2001) suggested that this Club provided a foundation for American intellectual thought for decades to come. James joined the Anti-Imperialist League in 1898, in opposition to the United States annexation of the Philippines.

Among James&#x27;s students at Harvard University were Boris Sidis, Theodore Roosevelt, George Santayana, W. E. B. Du Bois, G. Stanley Hall, Ralph Barton Perry, Gertrude Stein, Horace Kallen, Morris Raphael Cohen, Walter Lippmann, Alain Locke, C. I. Lewis, and Mary Whiton Calkins. Antiquarian bookseller Gabriel Wells tutored under him at Harvard in the late 1890s.

His students enjoyed his brilliance and his manner of teaching was free of personal arrogance. They remember him for his kindness and humble attitude. His respectful attitude towards them speaks well of his character.

Following his January 1907 retirement from Harvard, James continued to write and lecture, publishing &quot;Pragmatism&quot;, &quot;A Pluralistic Universe&quot;, and &quot;The Meaning of Truth&quot;. James was increasingly afflicted with cardiac pain during his last years. It worsened in 1909 while he worked on a philosophy text (unfinished but posthumously published as &quot;Some Problems in Philosophy&quot;). 

James sailed to Europe in the spring of 1910 to take experimental treatments for his heart ailment that proved unsuccessful, and returned home on August 18. His heart failed on August 26, 1910, at his home in Chocorua, New Hampshire.
He was buried in the family plot in Cambridge Cemetery, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He was one of the strongest proponents of the school of functionalism in psychology and of pragmatism in philosophy. He was a founder of the American Society for Psychical Research, as well as a champion of alternative approaches to healing. In 1884 and 1885 he became president of the British Society for Psychical Research for which he wrote in &quot;Mind&quot; and in the &quot;Psychological Review&quot;.
He challenged his professional colleagues not to let a narrow mindset prevent an honest appraisal of those beliefs.

In an empirical study by Haggbloom et al. using six criteria such as citations and recognition, James was found to be the 14th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.

== Family ==
William James was the son of Henry James (Senior) of Albany, and Mary Robertson Walsh. He had four siblings: Henry (the novelist), Garth Wilkinson, Robertson, and Alice.
William became engaged to Alice Howe Gibbens on May 10, 1878; they were married on July 10. They had 5 children: Henry (May 18, 1879 – 1947), William (June 17, 1882 – 1961), Herman (1884, died in infancy), Margaret (March 1887 – 1950) and Alexander (December 22, 1890 – 1946).

Most of William James&#x27;s ancestors arrived in America from Scotland or Ireland in the 18th century. Many of them settled in eastern New York or New Jersey. All of James&#x27;s ancestors were Protestant, well educated, and of character. Within their communities, they worked as farmers, merchants, and traders who were all heavily involved with their church. The last ancestor to arrive in America was William James&#x27;s paternal grandfather also named William James. He came to America from Ballyjamesduff, County Cavan, Ireland in 1789 when he was 18 years old. There is suspicion that he fled to America because his family tried to force him into the ministry. After traveling to America with no money left, he found a job at a store as a clerk. After continuously working, he was able to own the store himself. As he traveled west to find more job opportunities, he was involved in various jobs such as the salt industry and the Erie Canal project. After being a significant worker in the Erie Canal project and helping Albany become a major center of trade, he then became the first vice-president of the Albany Savings Bank. William James (grandfather) went from being a poor Irish immigrant to one of the richest men in New York. After his death, his son Henry James inherited his fortune and lived in Europe and the United States searching for the meaning of life.

Of James&#x27; five children, two—Margaret and Alexander—are known to have had children. Descendants of Alexander are still living.

== Writings ==
William James wrote voluminously throughout his life. A non-exhaustive bibliography of his writings, compiled by John McDermott, is 47 pages long.

He gained widespread recognition with his monumental &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; (1890), totaling twelve hundred pages in two volumes, which took twelve years to complete. &quot;Psychology: The Briefer Course&quot;, was an 1892 abridgement designed as a less rigorous introduction to the field. These works criticized both the English associationist school and the Hegelianism of his day as competing dogmatisms of little explanatory value, and sought to re-conceive the human mind as inherently purposive and selective.

President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s Moral Equivalent of War Speech, on April 17, 1977, equating the United States&#x27; 1970s energy crisis, oil crisis, and the changes and sacrifices Carter&#x27;s proposed plans would require with the &quot;moral equivalent of war&quot;, may have borrowed its title and much of its theme from James&#x27;s classic essay &quot;The Moral Equivalent of War&quot; derived from his last speech, delivered at Stanford University in 1906, and published in 1910, in which &quot;James considered one of the classic problems of politics: how to sustain political unity and civic virtue in the absence of war or a credible threat&quot;, and which &quot;sounds a rallying cry for service in the interests of the individual and the nation&quot;.

In simple terms, his philosophy and writings can be understood as an emphasis on &quot;fruits over roots,&quot; a reflection of his pragmatist tendency to focus on the practical consequences of ideas rather than become mired in unproductive metaphysical arguments or fruitless attempts to ground truth in abstract ways. Ever the empiricist, James believes we are better off evaluating the fruitfulness of ideas by testing them in the common ground of lived experience.

James was remembered as one of America&#x27;s representative thinkers, psychologist, and philosopher. William James was also an influential writer on religion, psychical research, and self-help.

== Epistemology ==

James defined true beliefs as those that prove useful to the believer. His pragmatic theory of truth was a synthesis of correspondence theory of truth and coherence theory of truth, with an added dimension. Truth is verifiable to the extent that thoughts and statements correspond with actual things, as well as the extent to which they &quot;hang together&quot;, or cohere, as pieces of a puzzle might fit together; these are in turn verified by the observed results of the application of an idea to actual practice.

James held a world view in line with pragmatism, declaring that the value of any truth was utterly dependent upon its use to the person who held it. Additional tenets of James&#x27;s pragmatism include the view that the world is a mosaic of diverse experiences that can only be properly interpreted and understood through an application of &quot;radical empiricism&quot;. &quot;Radical empiricism&quot;, not related to the everyday scientific empiricism, asserts that the world and experience can never be halted for an entirely objective analysis; the mind of the observer and the act of observation affect any empirical approach to truth. The mind, its experiences, and nature are inseparable. James&#x27;s emphasis on diversity as the default human condition—over and against duality, especially Hegelian dialectical duality—has maintained a strong influence in American culture. James&#x27;s description of the mind-world connection, which he described in terms of a &quot;stream of consciousness&quot;, had a direct and significant impact on avant-garde and modernist literature and art, notably in the case of James Joyce.

In &quot;What Pragmatism Means&quot; (1906), James writes that the central point of his own doctrine of truth is, in brief:
Truths emerge from facts, but they dip forward into facts again and add to them; which facts again create or reveal new truth (the word is indifferent) and so on indefinitely. The &quot;facts&quot; themselves meanwhile are not true. They simply are. Truth is the function of the beliefs that start and terminate among them.Richard Rorty made the contested claim that James did not mean to give a theory of truth with this statement and that we should not regard it as such. However, other pragmatism scholars such as Susan Haack and Howard Mounce do not share Rorty&#x27;s instrumentalist interpretation of James.

In &quot;The Meaning of Truth&quot; (1909), James seems to speak of truth in relativistic terms, in reference to critics of pragmatism: &quot;The critic&#x27;s trouble … seems to come from his taking the word &#x27;true&#x27; irrelatively, whereas the pragmatist always means &#x27;true for him who experiences the workings.&#x27;&quot;
However, James responded to critics accusing him of relativism, skepticism, or agnosticism, and of believing only in relative truths. To the contrary, he supported an epistemological realism position.

=== Pragmatism and &quot;cash value&quot; ===
&quot;Pragmatism&quot; is a philosophical approach that seeks to both define truth and resolve metaphysical issues. William James demonstrates an application of his method in the form of a simple story: A live squirrel supposed to be clinging on one side of a tree-trunk; while over against the tree&#x27;s opposite side a human being was imagined to stand. This human witness tries to get sight of the squirrel by moving rapidly round the tree, but no matter how fast he goes, the squirrel moves as fast in the opposite direction, and always keeps the tree between himself and the man, so that never a glimpse of him is caught. The resultant metaphysical problem now is this: &quot;Does the man go round the squirrel or not?&quot;James solves the issue by making a distinction between &quot;practical&quot; meaning. That is, the distinction between meanings of &quot;round&quot;. &quot;Round&quot; in the sense that the man occupies the space north, east, south, and west of the squirrel; and &quot;round&quot; in the sense that the man occupies the space facing the squirrel&#x27;s belly, back and sides. Depending on what the debaters meant by &quot;going round&quot;, the answer would be clear. From this example James derives the definition of the &quot;pragmatic method&quot;: to settle metaphysical disputes, one must simply make a distinction of practical consequences between notions, then, the answer is either clear, or the &quot;dispute is idle&quot;.

Both James and his colleague, Charles Sanders Peirce, coined the term &quot;cash value&quot;:
When he said that the whole meaning of a (clear) conception consists in the entire set of its practical consequences, he had in mind that a meaningful conception must have some sort of experiential &quot;cash value,&quot; must somehow be capable of being related to some sort of collection of possible empirical observations under specifiable conditions.A statement&#x27;s truthfulness is verifiable through its correspondence to reality, and its observable effects of putting the idea to practice. For example, James extends his Pragmatism to the hypothesis of God: &quot;On pragmatic principles, if the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily in the widest sense of the word, it is true. … The problem is to build it out and determine it so that it will combine satisfactorily with all the other working truths.&quot;
From this, we also know that &quot;new&quot; truths must also correspond to already existent truths as well.

From the introduction by Bruce Kuklick (1981, p. xiv) to James&#x27;s &quot;Pragmatism&quot;:

James went on to apply the pragmatic method to the epistemological problem of truth. He would seek the meaning of &quot;true&quot; by examining how the idea functioned in our lives. A belief was true, he said, if it worked for all of us, and guided us expeditiously through our semihospitable world. James was anxious to uncover what true beliefs amounted to in human life, what their &quot;cash value&quot; was, and what consequences they led to. A belief was not a mental entity which somehow mysteriously corresponded to an external reality if the belief were true. Beliefs were ways of acting with reference to a precarious environment, and to say they were true was to say they were efficacious in this environment. In this sense the pragmatic theory of truth applied Darwinian ideas in philosophy; it made survival the test of intellectual as well as biological fitness.

James&#x27;s book of lectures on pragmatism is arguably the most influential book of American philosophy. The lectures inside depict his position on the subject. In his sixth lecture, he begins by defining truth as &quot;agreement with reality&quot;. With this, James warns that there will be disagreements between pragmatics and intellectualists over the concepts of &quot;agreement&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;, the last reasoning before thoughts settle and become autonomous for us. However, he contrasts this by supporting a more practical interpretation that: a true idea or belief is one that we can blend with our thinking so that it can be justified through experiences.

Whereby the agreement of truths with &quot;reality&quot; results in useful outcomes, &quot;the &#x27;reality&#x27; with which truths must agree has three dimensions&quot;:

# &quot;matters of fact&quot;;
# &quot;relations of ideas&quot;; and
# &quot;the entire set of other truths to which we are committed&quot;.

According to James&#x27;s pragmatic approach to belief, knowledge is commonly viewed as a justified and true belief. James will accept a view if its conception of truth is analyzed and justified through interpretation, pragmatically. As a matter of fact, James&#x27;s whole philosophy is of productive beliefs.

Belief in anything involves conceiving of how it is real, but disbelief is the result when we dismiss something because it contradicts another thing we think of as real. In his &quot;Sentiment of Rationality&quot;, saying that crucial beliefs are not known is to doubt their truth, even if it seems possible. James names four &quot;postulates of rationality&quot; as valuable but unknowable: God, immorality, freedom, and moral duty.

In contrast, the weak side to pragmatism is that the best justification for a claim is whether it works. However, a claim that does not have outcomes cannot be justified, or unjustified, because it will not make a difference.

When James moves on to then state that pragmatism&#x27;s goal is ultimately &quot;to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences&quot;, he does not clarify what he means by &quot;practical consequences.&quot;
On the other hand, his friend, colleague, and another key founder in establishing pragmatist beliefs, Charles S. Peirce, dives deeper in defining these consequences. For Peirce, &quot;the consequences we are concerned with are &quot;general&quot; and &quot;intelligible&quot;.&quot;
He further explains this in his 1878 paper &quot;How to Make Ideas Clear,&quot; when he introduces a maxim that allows one to interpret consequences as grades of clarity and conception.
Describing how everything is derived from perception, Peirce uses the example of the doctrine of transubstantiation to show exactly how he defines practical consequences. Protestants interpret the bread and wine of the Eucharist is flesh and blood in only a subjective sense, while Catholics would label them as actual, and divinely mystical properties of flesh via the &quot;body, blood, soul, and divinity&quot;, even with the physical properties remaining as bread and wine in appearance. But to everyone, there can be no knowledge of the wine and bread of the Eucharist unless it is established that either wine and bread possesses certain properties or that anything that is interpreted as the blood and body of Christ is the blood and body of Christ. With this Peirce declares that &quot;our action has exclusive reference to what affects the senses&quot;, and that we can mean nothing by transubstantiation than &quot;what has certain effects, direct or indirect, upon our senses.&quot;
In this sense, James&#x27;s pragmatic influencer Peirce establishes that what counts as a practical consequence or effect is what can affect one&#x27;s senses and what is comprehensible and fathomable in the natural world.

&quot;Yet James never worked out his understanding of &#x27;practical consequences&#x27; as fully as Peirce did&quot;, nor does he limit these consequences to the senses as Peirce does. This raises the question: what does it mean to be practical? Whether James means the greatest number of positive consequences (in light of utilitarianism), a consequence that considers other perspectives (such as his compromise of the tender and tough ways of thinking),
or a completely different take altogether, it is unclear what consequences truly fit the pragmatic standard. The closest James comes to explaining this idea is by telling his audience to weigh the difference it would &quot;practically make to anyone&quot; if one opinion over the other were true, and although he attempts to clarify this, he never specifies the method by which one would weigh the difference between one opinion over the other. Thus, the flaw in his argument appears in that it is difficult to fathom how he would determine these practical consequences, which he continually refers to throughout his work, to be measured or interpreted. He has said that an opinion is correct that works for us humans in practice.

=== Will to believe doctrine ===
In William James&#x27;s 1896 lecture titled &quot;The Will to Believe&quot;, James defends the right to violate the principle of evidentialism in order to justify hypothesis venturing. This idea foresaw 20th century objections to evidentialism and sought to ground justified belief in an unwavering principle that would prove more beneficial. Through his philosophy of pragmatism William James justifies religious beliefs by using the results of his hypothetical venturing as evidence to support the hypothesis&#x27;s truth. Therefore, this doctrine allows one to assume belief in a god and prove its existence by what the belief brings to one&#x27;s life.

This was criticized by advocates of skepticism rationality, like Bertrand Russell in Free Thought and Official Propaganda and Alfred Henry Lloyd with The Will to Doubt. Both argued that one must always adhere to fallibilism, recognizing of all human knowledge that &quot;None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error&quot;, and that the only means of progressing ever-closer to the truth is to never assume certainty, but always examine all sides and try to reach a conclusion objectively.

== Free will ==
In his search for truth and assorted principles of psychology, William James developed his two-stage model of free will. In his model, he tries to explain how it is people come to the making of a decision and what factors are involved in it. He firstly defines our basic ability to choose as free will. Then he specifies our two factors as chance and choice. &quot;James&#x27;s two-stage model effectively separates chance (the in-deterministic free element) from choice (an arguably determinate decision that follows causally from one&#x27;s character, values, and especially feelings and desires at the moment of decision).&quot;

James argues that the question of free will revolves around &quot;chance.&quot; The idea of chance is that some events are possibilities, things that could happen but are not guaranteed. &quot;Chance&quot; is a neutral term (it is, in this case, neither inherently positive nor &quot;intrinsically irrational and preposterous,&quot; connotations it usually has); the only information it gives about the events to which it applies is that they are disconnected from other things – they are &quot;not controlled, secured, or necessitated by other things&quot; before they happen.
Chance is made possible regarding our actions because our amount of effort is subject to change. If the amount of effort we put into something is predetermined, our actions are predetermined.

Free will in relation to effort also balances &quot;&quot;ideals&quot; and &quot;propensities&quot;—the things you see as best versus the things that are easiest to do&quot;. Without effort, &quot;the propensity is stronger than the ideal.&quot; To act according to your ideals, you must resist the things that are easiest, and this can only be done with effort.
James states that the free will question is therefore simple: &quot;it relates solely to the amount of effort of attention or consent which we can at any time put forth.&quot;

&quot;Chance&quot; is the &quot;free element&quot;, that part of the model we have no control over. James says that in the sequence of the model, chance comes before choice. In the moment of decision we are given the chance to make a decision and then the choice is what we do (or do not do) regarding the decision.

When it comes to choice, James says we make a choice based on different experiences. It comes from our own past experiences, the observations of others, or: A supply of ideas of the various movements that are … left in the memory by experiences of their involuntary performance is thus the first prerequisite of the voluntary life.What James describes is that once you&#x27;ve made a decision in the past, the experience is stockpiled into your memory where it can be referenced the next time a decision must be made and will be drawn from as a positive solution. However, in his development of the design, James also struggled with being able to prove that free will is actually free or predetermined.

People can make judgements of regret, moral approval and moral disapproval, and if those are absent, then that means our will is predetermined. An example of this is &quot;James says the problem is a very &#x27;personal&#x27; one and that he cannot personally conceive of the universe as a place where murder must happen.&quot;
Essentially, if there were no regrets or judgments then all the bad stuff would not be considered bad, only as predetermined because there are no options of &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;bad&#x27;. &quot;The free will option is pragmatically truer because it better accommodates the judgments of regret and morality.&quot; Overall, James uses this line of reasoning to prove that our will is indeed free: because of our morality codes, and the conceivable alternate universes where a decision has been regarded different from what we chose.

In &quot;The Will to Believe&quot;, James simply asserted that his will was free. As his first act of freedom, he said, he chose to believe his will was free. He was encouraged to do this by reading Charles Renouvier, whose work convinced James to convert from monism to pluralism. In his diary entry of April 30, 1870, James wrote:

I think that yesterday was a crisis in my life. I finished the first part of Renouvier&#x27;s second Essais and see no reason why his definition of free will—&quot;the sustaining of a thought because I choose to when I might have other thoughts&quot;—need be the definition of an illusion. At any rate, I will assume for the present—until next year—that it is no illusion. My first act of free will shall be to believe in free will.

In 1884, James set the terms for all future discussions of determinism and compatibilism in the free will debates with his lecture to Harvard Divinity School students published as &quot;The Dilemma of Determinism&quot;.
In this talk he defined the common terms &quot;hard determinism&quot; and &quot;soft determinism&quot; (now more commonly called &quot;compatibilism&quot;).

Old-fashioned determinism was what we may call hard determinism. It did not shrink from such words as fatality, bondage of the will, necessitation, and the like. Nowadays, we have a soft determinism which abhors harsh words, and, repudiating fatality, necessity, and even predetermination, says that its real name is freedom; for freedom is only necessity understood, and bondage to the highest is identical with true freedom.

James called compatibilism a &quot;quagmire of evasion,&quot; just as the ideas of Thomas Hobbes and David Hume—that free will was simply freedom from external coercion—were called a &quot;wretched subterfuge&quot; by Immanuel Kant.

&quot;Indeterminism&quot; is &quot;the belief in freedom [which] holds that there is some degree of possibility that is not necessitated by the rest of reality.&quot;
The word &quot;some&quot; in this definition is crucial in James&#x27;s argument because it leaves room for a higher power, as it does not require that all events be random. Specifically, indeterminism does not say that no events are guaranteed or connected to previous events; instead, it says that some events are not guaranteed – some events are up to chance. In James&#x27;s model of free will, choice is deterministic, determined by the person making it, and it &quot;follows casually from one&#x27;s character, values, and especially feelings and desires at the moment of decision.&quot;
Chance, on the other hand, is indeterministic, and pertains to possibilities that could happen but are not guaranteed. James described chance as neither hard nor soft determinism, but &quot;indeterminism&quot;:

The stronghold of the determinist argument is the antipathy to the idea of chance ... This notion of alternative possibility, this admission that any one of several things may come to pass is, after all, only a roundabout name for chance.

James asked the students to consider his choice for walking home from Lowell Lecture Hall after his talk:

What is meant by saying that my choice of which way to walk home after the lecture is ambiguous and matter of chance? ... It means that both Divinity Avenue and Oxford Street are called but only one, and that one either one, shall be chosen.

With this simple example, James laid out a two-stage decision process with chance in a present time of random alternatives, leading to a choice of one possibility that transforms an ambiguous future into a simple unalterable past. James&#x27;s two-stage model separates chance (undetermined alternative possibilities) from choice (the free action of the individual, on which randomness has no effect). Subsequent thinkers using this model include Henri Poincaré, Arthur Holly Compton, and Karl Popper.

== Philosophy of religion ==
James did important work in philosophy of religion. In his Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh he provided a wide-ranging account of &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (1902) and interpreted them according to his pragmatic leanings. Some of the important claims he makes in this regard:
* Religious genius (experience) should be the primary topic in the study of religion, rather than religious institutions—since institutions are merely the social descendant of genius.
* The intense, even pathological varieties of experience (religious or otherwise) should be sought by psychologists, because they represent the closest thing to a microscope of the mind—that is, they show us in drastically enlarged form the normal processes of things.
* In order to usefully interpret the realm of common, shared experience and history, we must each make certain &quot;over-beliefs&quot; in things which, while they cannot be proven on the basis of experience, help us to live fuller and better lives.
* A variety of characteristics can be seen within a single individual. There are subconscious elements that compose the scattered fragments of a personality. This is the reflection of a greater dissociation which is the separation between science and religion.
* Religious Mysticism is only one half of mysticism, the other half is composed of the insane and both of these are co-located in the &quot;great subliminal or transmarginal region&quot;.

James investigated mystical experiences throughout his life, leading him to experiment with chloral hydrate (1870), amyl nitrite (1875), nitrous oxide (1882), and peyote (1896). James claimed that it was only when he was under the influence of nitrous oxide that he was able to understand Hegel.
He concluded that while the revelations of the mystic hold true, they hold true only for the mystic; for others, they are certainly ideas to be considered, but can hold no claim to truth without personal experience of such. &quot;American Philosophy: An Encyclopedia&quot; classes him as one of several figures who &quot;took a more pantheist or pandeist approach by rejecting views of God as separate from the world.&quot;

James was an advocate of theistic finitism, which he used to explain the problem of evil.

== Mysticism ==
William James devoted much of his career to the psychological investigation of mysticism. A significant influence on this undertaking was his own mystical experience under the influence of nitrous oxide. Inspired by a report by Benjamin Paul Blood in 1874, James experimented with inhaled nitrous oxide, upon which he experienced a &quot;tremendously exciting sense of an intense metaphysical illumination&quot; in which &quot;every opposition ... vanished in a higher unity&quot; and &quot;the ego and its objects ... are one.&quot; For so ardent an anti-Hegelian, this was a particularly novel and confusing experience for James. He was powerfully affected by the event and struggled greatly to interpret it. His journey of self discovery instigated by the experience is largely what inspired his later in-depth investigations of mysticism.

William James provided a description of mystical experience in his famous collection of lectures published in 1902 as &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. He posits four criteria as &quot;sufficient to mark out a group of states of consciousness&quot; which may be called the &quot;mystical group.&quot;

These criteria are as follows:
* Ineffability – no adequate report of the contents of the experience can be given by words. This was the &quot;handiest&quot; of descriptors for James, and illustrates the necessity of direct, first-hand experience to actually understand a mystical state of consciousness. 
* Noetic quality – &quot;...mystical states seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge.&quot; Mystical consciousness generates a feeling of insight into truths inaccessible to ordinary reasoning. These intuitions or insights are often felt as authoritative both during and after they are experienced, but are necessarily confined by the first criterion of ineffability, and are thus inexpressible in words. 
* Transiency – the mystical state is unable to be sustained for long periods of time. They are, however, recognizable upon re-experience, and can be further developed over multiple occasions. 
* Passivity – a feeling of suspension of control of one&#x27;s personal will, occasionally as if grasped by a superior power.

For James, the first two attributes, ineffability and the noetic quality, &quot;will entitle any state to be called mystical, in the sense in which I use the word.&quot; The qualities of transiency and passivity are &quot;less sharply marked, but are usually found.&quot; He uses a number of historical examples to illustrate the presence of these attributes in geographically and temporally disparate instances, concluding that the mystical experience &quot;is on the whole pantheistic and optimistic, or at least the opposite of pessimistic. It is anti-naturalistic, and harmonizes best with twice-bornness and so-called other-worldly states of mind&quot; (original italics).

In line with his pragmatism, he asserted that the epistemological authority of mystical consciousness for the individual who experiences it is may be rightfully justified, but that others are under no obligation to accept that authority uncritically. Importantly, however, the mere existence of mystical states necessarily indicates an incompleteness in the epistemological authority of the non-mystical. He would continue to advocate for the acceptance of mystical states as a fruitful subject of psychological research and source of knowledge. In his book &quot;The Pluralistic Universe&quot; (1909), he would expand upon his notion of &quot;radical empiricism&quot; in arguing for the possible association of empiricism and religion in the study of human spirituality In viewing mysticism from a psychological perspective, he acknowledged that the limits of our being extend far beyond what is ordinarily accessible by our sense perception, and that our finite beings are affected by unconscious forces. &quot;But that which produces effects within another reality must be termed a reality itself, so I feel as if we had no philosophic excuse for calling the unseen or mystical world unreal.&quot;

James viewed mysticism as the most foundational aspect of religion. While he grants that religious experience reveals the possibility of union with something greater than oneself, he clarifies that mysticism (and philosophy) identify that something as an &quot;all inclusive soul of the world&quot; that he does not deem wholly necessary for a practical and fulfilling religious life. As always, James is averse to any dogmatic or absolutist doctrines, within religion and without, and thus values mysticism as a unique method of personal acquaintance with a larger reality.

== Instincts ==

Like Sigmund Freud, James was influenced by Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of natural selection. At the core of James&#x27;s theory of psychology, as defined in &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; (1890), was a system of &quot;instincts&quot;. James wrote that humans had many instincts, even more than other animals. These instincts, he said, could be overridden by experience and by each other, as many of the instincts were actually in conflict with each other.
In the 1920s, however, psychology turned away from evolutionary theory and embraced radical behaviorism.

== Theory of emotion ==
James is one of the two namesakes of the James–Lange theory of emotion, which he formulated independently of Carl Lange in the 1880s. The theory holds that emotion is the mind&#x27;s perception of physiological conditions that result from some stimulus. In James&#x27;s oft-cited example, it is not that we see a bear, fear it, and run; we see a bear and run; consequently, we fear the bear. Our mind&#x27;s perception of the higher adrenaline level, heartbeat, etc. is the emotion.

This way of thinking about emotion has great consequences for the philosophy of aesthetics as well as to the philosophy and practice of education. Here is a passage from his work, &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot;, that spells out those consequences:

The theory of emotion was also independently developed in Italy by the anthropologist Giuseppe Sergi.

=== William James&#x27; bear ===
From Joseph LeDoux&#x27;s description of William James&#x27; &quot;Emotion&quot;:

Why do we run away if we notice that we are in danger? Because we are afraid of what will happen if we don&#x27;t. This obvious answer to a seemingly trivial question has been the central concern of a century-old debate about the nature of our emotions.It all began in 1884 when William James published an article titled &quot;What Is an Emotion?&quot;
The article appeared in a philosophy journal called &quot;Mind&quot;, as there were no psychology journals yet. It was important, not because it definitively answered the question it raised, but because of the way in which James phrased his response. He conceived of an emotion in terms of a sequence of events that starts with the occurrence of an arousing stimulus (the sympathetic nervous system or the parasympathetic nervous system); and ends with a passionate feeling, a conscious emotional experience. A major goal of emotion research is still to elucidate this stimulus-to-feeling sequence—to figure out what processes come between the stimulus and the feeling.

James set out to answer his question by asking another: do we run from a bear because we are afraid or are we afraid because we run? He proposed that the obvious answer, that we run because we are afraid, was wrong, and instead argued that we are afraid because we run:

Our natural way of thinking about … emotions is that the mental perception of some fact excites the mental affection called emotion, and that this latter state of mind gives rise to the bodily expression. My theory, on the contrary, is that the bodily changes follow directly the perception of the exciting fact, and that our feeling of the same changes as they occur IS the emotion (called &#x27;feeling&#x27; by Damasio).

The essence of James&#x27;s proposal was simple. It was premised on the fact that emotions are often accompanied by bodily responses (racing heart, tight stomach, sweaty palms, tense muscles, and so on; sympathetic nervous system) and that we can sense what is going on inside our body much the same as we can sense what is going on in the outside world. According to James, emotions feel different from other states of mind because they have these bodily responses that give rise to internal sensations, and different emotions feel different from one another because they are accompanied by different bodily responses and sensations. For example, when we see James&#x27;s bear, we run away. During this act of escape, the body goes through a physiological upheaval: blood pressure rises, heart rate increases, pupils dilate, palms sweat, muscles contract in certain ways (evolutionary, innate defense mechanisms). Other kinds of emotional situations will result in different bodily upheavals. In each case, the physiological responses return to the brain in the form of bodily sensations, and the unique pattern of sensory feedback gives each emotion its unique quality. Fear feels different from anger or love because it has a different physiological signature (the parasympathetic nervous system for love). The mental aspect of emotion, the feeling, is a slave to its physiology, not vice versa: we do not tremble because we are afraid or cry because we feel sad; we are afraid because we tremble and are sad because we cry.

== Philosophy of history ==
One of the long-standing schisms in the philosophy of history concerns the role of individuals in social change.

One faction sees individuals (as seen in Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; and Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s &quot;The French Revolution, A History&quot;) as the motive power of history, and the broader society as the page on which they write their acts. The other sees society as moving according to holistic principles or laws, and sees individuals as its more-or-less willing pawns. In 1880, James waded into this controversy with &quot;Great Men, Great Thoughts, and the Environment&quot;, an essay published in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He took Carlyle&#x27;s side, but without Carlyle&#x27;s one-sided emphasis on the political/military sphere, upon heroes as the founders or overthrowers of states and empires.

A philosopher, according to James, must accept geniuses as a given entity the same way as a biologist accepts as an entity Darwin&#x27;s &quot;spontaneous variations&quot;. The role of an individual will depend on the degree of its conformity with the social environment, epoch, moment, etc.

James introduces a notion of receptivities of the moment. The societal mutations from generation to generation are determined (directly or indirectly) mainly by the acts or examples of individuals whose genius was so adapted to the receptivities of the moment or whose accidental position of authority was so critical that they became ferments, initiators of movements, setters of precedent or fashion, centers of corruption, or destroyers of other persons, whose gifts, had they had free play, would have led society in another direction.

== View on Social Darwinism ==

While James accepted Darwin&#x27;s theories of biological evolution, he regarded Social Darwinism as propagated by philosophers such as Herbert Spencer as a sham. He was highly skeptical of applying Darwin&#x27;s formula of natural selection to human societies in a way that put the Anglo-Saxons on top of the chain. James&#x27; rejection of Social Darwinism was a minority opinion at Harvard in the 1870s and 1880s.

== View on spiritualism and associationism ==

James studied closely the schools of thought known as associationism and spiritualism. The view of an associationist is that each experience that one has leads to another, creating a chain of events. The association does not tie together two ideas, but rather physical objects.
This association occurs on an atomic level. Small physical changes occur in the brain which eventually form complex ideas or associations. Thoughts are formed as these complex ideas work together and lead to new experiences. Isaac Newton and David Hartley both were precursors to this school of thought, proposing such ideas as &quot;physical vibrations in the brain, spinal cord, and nerves are the basis of all sensations, all ideas, and all motions …&quot;
James disagreed with associationism in that he believed it to be too simple. He referred to associationism as &quot;psychology without a soul&quot;
because there is nothing from within creating ideas; they just arise by associating objects with one another.

On the other hand, a spiritualist believes that mental events are attributed to the soul. Whereas in associationism, ideas and behaviors are separate, in spiritualism, they are connected. Spiritualism encompasses the term innatism, which suggests that ideas cause behavior. Ideas of past behavior influence the way a person will act in the future; these ideas are all tied together by the soul. Therefore, an inner soul causes one to have a thought, which leads them to perform a behavior, and memory of past behaviors determine how one will act in the future.

James had a strong opinion about these schools of thought. He was, by nature, a pragmatist and thus took the view that one should use whatever parts of theories make the most sense and can be proven. Therefore, he recommended breaking apart spiritualism and associationism and using the parts of them that make the most sense. James believed that each person has a soul, which exists in a spiritual universe, and leads a person to perform the behaviors they do in the physical world. James was influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg, who first introduced him to this idea. James stated that, although it does appear that humans use associations to move from one event to the next, this cannot be done without this soul tying everything together. For, after an association has been made, it is the person who decides which part of it to focus on, and therefore determines in which direction following associations will lead. Associationism is too simple in that it does not account for decision-making of future behaviors, and memory of what worked well and what did not. Spiritualism, however, does not demonstrate actual physical representations for how associations occur. James combined the views of spiritualism and associationism to create his own way of thinking. James discussed tender-minded thinkers as religious, optimistic, dogmatic, and monistic. Tough-minded thinkers were irreligious, pessimistic, pluralists, and skeptical. Healthy-minded individuals were seen as natural believers by having faith in God and universal order. People who focused on human miseries and suffering were noted as sick souls.

James was a founding member and vice president of the American Society for Psychical Research.
The lending of his name made Leonora Piper a famous medium. In 1885, the year after the death of his young son, James had his first sitting with Piper at the suggestion of his mother-in-law.
He was soon convinced that Piper knew things she could only have discovered by supernatural means. He expressed his belief in Piper by saying, &quot;If you wish to upset the law that all crows are black, it is enough if you prove that one crow is white. My white crow is Mrs. Piper.&quot;
However, James did not believe that Piper was in contact with spirits. After evaluating sixty-nine reports of Piper&#x27;s mediumship he considered the hypothesis of telepathy as well as Piper obtaining information about her sitters by natural means such as her memory recalling information. According to James the &quot;spirit-control&quot; hypothesis of her mediumship was incoherent, irrelevant and in cases demonstrably false.

James held séances with Piper and was impressed by some of the details he was given; however, according to Massimo Polidoro a maid in the household of James was friendly with a maid in Piper&#x27;s house and this may have been a source of information that Piper used for private details about James.
Bibliographers Frederick Burkhardt and Fredson Bowers who compiled the works of James wrote &quot;It is thus possible that Mrs. Piper&#x27;s knowledge of the James family was acquired from the gossip of servants and that the whole mystery rests on the failure of the people upstairs to realize that servants [downstairs] also have ears.&quot;

James was convinced that the &quot;future will corroborate&quot; the existence of telepathy.
Psychologists such as James McKeen Cattell and Edward B. Titchener took issue with James&#x27;s support for psychical research and considered his statements unscientific.
Cattell in a letter to James wrote that the &quot;Society for Psychical Research is doing much to injure psychology&quot;.

== James&#x27; theory of the self ==
James&#x27; theory of the self divided a person&#x27;s mental picture of self into two categories: the &quot;Me&quot; and the &quot;I&quot;. The &quot;Me&quot; can be thought of as a separate object or individual a person refers to when describing their personal experiences; while the &quot;I&quot; is the self that knows who they are and what they have done in their life. Both concepts are depicted in the statement; &quot;&quot;I&quot; know it was &quot;me&quot; who ate the cookie.&quot; He called the &quot;Me&quot; part of self the &quot;empirical me&quot; and the &quot;I&quot; part &quot;the pure Ego&quot;. For James, the &quot;I&quot; part of self was the thinking self, which could not be further divided. He linked this part of the self to the soul of a person, or what is now thought of as the mind. Educational theorists have been inspired in various ways by James&#x27;s theory of self, and have developed various applications to curricular and pedagogical theory and practice.

James further divided the &quot;Me&quot; part of self into: a material, a social, and a spiritual self, as below.

=== Material self ===
The material self consists of things that belong to a person or entities that a person belongs to. Thus, things like the body, family, clothes, money, and such make up the material self. For James, the core of the material self was the body.
Second to the body, James felt a person&#x27;s clothes were important to the material self. He believed a person&#x27;s clothes were one way they expressed who they felt they were; or clothes were a way to show status, thus contributing to forming and maintaining one&#x27;s self-image. Money and family are critical parts of the material self. James felt that if one lost a family member, a part of who they are was lost also. Money figured in one&#x27;s material self in a similar way. If a person had significant money then lost it, who they were as a person changed as well.

=== Social self ===
Our social selves are who we are in a given social situation. For James, people change how they act depending on the social situation that they are in. James believed that people had as many social selves as they did social situations they participated in. For example, a person may act in a different way at work when compared to how that same person may act when they are out with a group of friends. James also believed that in a given social group, an individual&#x27;s social self may be divided even further. An example of this would be, in the social context of an individual&#x27;s work environment, the difference in behavior when that individual is interacting with their boss versus their behavior when interacting with a co-worker.

=== Spiritual self ===
For James, the spiritual self was who we are at our core. It is more concrete or permanent than the other two selves. The spiritual self is our subjective and most intimate self. Aspects of a spiritual self include things like personality, core values, and conscience that do not typically change throughout an individual&#x27;s lifetime. The spiritual self involves introspection, or looking inward to deeper spiritual, moral, or intellectual questions without the influence of objective thoughts. For James, achieving a high level of understanding of who we are at our core, or understanding our spiritual selves is more rewarding than satisfying the needs of the social and material selves.

=== Pure ego ===
What James refers to as the &quot;I&quot; self. For James, the pure ego is what provides the thread of continuity between our past, present, and future selves. The pure ego&#x27;s perception of consistent individual identity arises from a continuous stream of consciousness.
James believed that the pure ego was similar to what we think of as the soul, or the mind. The pure ego was not a substance and therefore could not be examined by science.

<text>Inside Monkey Zetterland is a 1992 independent comedy film directed by Jefery Levy and written by Steve Antin. The film follows Monkey Zetterland, a former child actor turned aspiring screenwriter and the goings-on with his eccentric family and friends. The story uses voiceover narration and is interspersed with fantasy sequences.

==Plot==
Monkey Zetterland is a struggling screenwriter and a former child actor who is working on a historical script based on the defunct Red Car subway of Los Angeles. He lives in a building owned by his neurotic mother Honor Zetterland, who is a famous soap opera star. While secretly hoping there is a future in acting for Monkey, she attempts to turn her other son, hairdresser Brent, into a film star.

Honor shows up at Monkey&#x27;s apartment to borrow his epsom salts at the same time that his disagreeable girlfriend, Daphne, arrives. His sister Grace arrives in tears to reveal that her lesbian girlfriend, Cindy, has become pregnant from a one-night stand in an attempt to bring the two of them closer. Honor rents the basement apartment to Sasha and Sofie, a gay man and lesbian posing as husband and wife while publishing an underground newsletter that outs closeted gay people in the entertainment industry.

As if this were not enough, a creepy woman, Bella, shows up with a fan letter for Honor, and another strange lady, Imogene, begins openly pursuing Monkey&#x27;s attention. After a series of confrontations with Monkey, Daphne moves out. At around the same time, his estranged father Mike, who was absent for long periods of time throughout the Zetterlands’ lives, surfaces in time for Thanksgiving.

While everyone busies themselves with their personal issues, Grace discovers that Sasha and Sofie are in fact terrorists who intend to bomb a local insurance agency that is denying medical coverage to people with HIV and AIDS. Sofie comes up with a plan to send Grace into the agency with a bomb, which Grace and Sasha believe is set up to give Grace enough time to escape before it detonates. It is not, and Grace dies in the explosion.

This event pulls everyone out of their own selfish interests and forces them to reexamine their lives and the people around them. The patriarch of the family disappears again, Cindy and her newborn baby are taken in by the family, and Monkey decides to let Imogene get closer to him. Then, just as things are starting to fall into place, Monkey comes home to find his apartment ransacked and his finally finished script, of which was his only copy, stolen.

Later that evening, Bella, who left a fan letter for Honor, arrives with Monkey&#x27;s stolen script and a gun. She tries to shoot Honor, but hits the family dog instead. She is taken down, but the ensuing drama pulls the remaining emotional conflicts of the family into place. Honor accepts that Monkey is never going to become a famous actor. Instead of pushing him into acting, she uses her industry connections to have his script produced into a film starring Brent.

==Cast==
== Production ==
The inspiration from the script came from Steve Antin’s own background, as he himself started out as a child actor before getting into writing. The script originated as a book of short stories titled &quot;Campfire Stories&quot;. While Antin was filming the 1988 movie &quot;The Accused&quot;, Jodie Foster asked to read some of Antin&#x27;s stories, after which she suggested he turn the stories into a film script.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere at the 1992 Seattle International Film Festival on June 5, 1992. It went on to screen at the Toronto Festival of Festivals on September 12, 1992, and was given a limited release in the United States on August 25, 1993.

=== Home media ===
It was released in 1994 on VHS and in 1995 on Laserdisc. The film was released on DVD on February 6, 2007.

==Critical reception==

On review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Inside Monkey Zetterland&quot; has an approval rating of 71% based on 7 reviews.

Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; said the film &quot;is funny, sharp-tongued and devious, but never wicked or nasty. Its resonant comedy is so attuned to the Zeitgeist that any urban dweller will find something relevant in it.&quot; Marjorie Baumgarten of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it three stars, writing, &quot;These actors all create riveting snapshots of oddballs in action,&quot; but also noting the film has a &quot;rambling storyline&quot;.

Negative reviews criticized the story and characterization. Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;After the characters have taken up most of the movie airing their idiosyncrasies, they undergo melodramatic fates that reveal little more than Antin&#x27;s recession of an imagination.&quot; &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave a mixed review, praising the film for &quot;inescapably [capturing] the LA attitude&quot;, but noting &quot;it has no real center, a point underlined by frequent scenes in which characters drift not only out of the frame, but into different rooms.&quot; The review commented that Levy &quot;never gives a clue how he relates to his characters or story, which isn&#x27;t much help to the viewer&quot;, but observed Coppola is given a chance to redeem herself after her much maligned performance in &quot;The Godfather Part III&quot;. Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the ensemble cast and said the film &quot;flaunts a number of audacious cinematic tricks&quot;, but disliked the film&#x27;s &quot;mood of manic chaos&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
Tate Donovan was nominated for Best Supporting Male at the 1994 Independent Spirit Awards. The film was also nominated for the Grand Jury Prize for Dramatic Feature at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival.

<text>Buzzkill is a hidden-camera reality show which started airing in 1996 on the MTV network. The show derived its name from the slang term &quot;buzzkill&quot;, meaning a sudden undesired event that causes one&#x27;s &quot;high&quot; or &quot;buzz&quot; to become of a lesser experience or depleted. Each new episode was set in a different location and consisted of three separate pranks.

==Premise==
A forerunner to prank reality shows, &quot;Buzzkill&quot; was essentially a series of elaborate pranks (backed by a major television network&#x27;s budget) played not only on the layman but often on celebrities and major public figures. Each prank was played by three aspiring actors from the Chicago area: Dave Sheridan (creator), Frank Hudetz, and Travis Draft.

The show&#x27;s most memorable moment was when Hudetz disguised himself as famous designer Isaac Mizrahi. The likeness was so uncanny that he fooled superstar Whitney Houston at an awards show; when Houston discovered the error, she felt she was made a fool of and vowed never to appear on MTV again.

The show was eventually cancelled due to litigation concerns at MTV. Because of &quot;Buzzkill&quot;, more outrageous reality shows were developed for MTV, including &quot;The Tom Green Show&quot;, &quot;Jackass&quot;, and &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot;.

The show&#x27;s theme song uses the same verse and chorus melody as the GG Allin classic &#x27;Multiple Forms of Self-Satisfaction&#x27;.

<text>The Nordstadt (North City) is the university quarter in the German city of Hanover. Part of the borough Hanover-Nord, it has 17,684 inhabitants (2020).

It was originally characterized by small factories and a big railway freightyard closed in 1996. During World War II large parts of the district were destroyed. Today, due to the university and cultural clubs, this district is a preferred residential area for students and people of immigrant background. An almost village-like atmosphere exists around the Luther Church (see photo) where a lot of pubs and small shops resides. Many alternative project groups have settled here and also numerous communes live in these houses. 

The area of the former &quot;Sprengel Chocolate Factory&quot; was squatted and later legalized. It formed the base for the annual German punk festival called the Chaos Days, every first weekend in August.

<text>The Georgengarten () is a landscape garden in the northwestern borough of Herrenhausen of the German city Hanover. It is a part of Herrenhausen Gardens.

==History==

Around 1700, country estates for several noblemen were established in the former flood plain of the river Leine. In 1726, the Herrenhäuser Allee (Herrenhausen alley) was planted just through the gardens, connecting Hanover with the royal palace and gardens of Herrenhausen in the boroughs of the city; it is almost exactly one geographical mile () long, and consists of four rows of lime trees.

In 1768 the German lieutenant-general and art collector Johann Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Wallmoden-Gimborn acquired some of these gardens and merged them into the Wallmodengarten. Between 1780 and 1782 he built his own palace there, the Wallmodenschloss (also called Wallmodenpalais) to house his antiquities collection.

In order to enlarge the royal gardens of Hanover, the Wallmoden palace and the Wallmoden garden 1817 were sold to George III, who had been King of Hanover since 1814. From 1818 on, the palace was named Georgenpalais and the gardens name changed into Georgengarten.

In 1826 the architect and engineer Georg Ludwig Friedrich Laves designed two smaller wings adjacent to the left and right side of the Wallmodenschloss. From 1828 until 1843 the formal garden was redesigned as an English style landscape garden. Former water features, canals and so on, were enlarged into a pond.

Between 1835 and 1841 the then head gardener, Christian Schaumburg, was responsible for some redesign. During these years, three bridges designed by Laves were built: 1837 the Fahrbrücke, in 1840 the Augustenbrücke, and in the same year, the Friederikenbrücke. The latter is the only remaining bridge of the three. Today it connects the Georgengarten and the Great Garden (Großer Garten) within the Herrenhausen Gardens.

At the city end of the Herrenhäuser Allee, in 1857, a gate was built after plans made by Laves. The gate separated Königsworther Platz (Königsworther square) from the alley and the Georgengarten. In the 1960s, the gate was demolished, but in 2007, a replica with some remaining original parts was placed there.

At the end of 19th century Napoleonic troops were going to cut down the whole Herrenhäuser Allee, but baker and grain dealer Johann Gerhard Helmcke (1780−1844) saved the alley by paying 3,000 Taler. To honour Helmcke&#x27;s deed, a memorial stone was placed near the alley.

In 1921 the City of Hanover bought both the Georgengarten and the Georgenpalais. During World War II the Georgenpalais was damaged severely by bombs during a Royal Air Force air raid. The Georgengarten was used to grow vegetables. In post war military occupation years, a lot of seeping engine oil and fuel of the British troop vehicles damaged many of the lime trees of the old Herrenhäuser Allee. Their step-by-step restoration took until the 1970s.

Since 1949, ownership of the Georgenpalais was transferred to the Wilhelm Busch Society, a literary society named after the famous German caricaturist, painter and poet Wilhelm Busch. They later rebuilt the damaged eastern wing of the building.

==Present use==

Today the house is used as a caricature museum and is named Wilhelm-Busch-Museum - &quot;Deutsches Museum für Karikatur und kritische Grafik&quot;. The Georgengarten now is a part of the famous Herrenhausen Gardens.

The Leibniz Temple in the park is named in honour of the German polymath Gottfried Leibniz. Originally it was erected between 1787 and 1790 at the Hanover military parade place (now called Waterlooplatz); later it was transferred to the Georgengarten. Today it is a popular venue during warm summer evenings, especially frequented by young people and students of the nearby Leibniz University Hannover.

<text>Emmanuel Levinas (born Emanuelis Levinas ; ; 12 January 1906 – 25 December 1995) was a French philosopher of Lithuanian Jewish ancestry who is known for his work within Jewish philosophy, existentialism, and phenomenology, focusing on the relationship of ethics to metaphysics and ontology.

==Life and career==
Levinas was born on 12 January 1906, into a middle-class Litvak family in Kaunas, in present-day Lithuania, then Kovno district, at the Western edge of the Russian Empire. Because of the disruptions of World War I, the family moved to Kharkiv in Ukraine in 1916, where they stayed during the Russian revolutions of February and October 1917. In 1920, his family returned to the Republic of Lithuania. Levinas&#x27;s early education was in secular, Russian-language schools in Kaunas and Kharkiv. Upon his family&#x27;s return to the Republic of Lithuania, Levinas spent two years at a Jewish gymnasium before departing for France, where he commenced his university education.

Levinas began his philosophical studies at the University of Strasbourg in 1923, and his lifelong friendship with the French philosopher Maurice Blanchot. In 1928, he went to the University of Freiburg for two semesters to study phenomenology under Edmund Husserl. At Freiburg he also met Martin Heidegger, whose philosophy greatly impressed him. Levinas would in the early 1930s be one of the first French intellectuals to draw attention to Heidegger and Husserl by translating, in 1931, Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Cartesian Meditations&quot; (with the help of Gabrielle Peiffer and with advice from Alexandre Koyré) and by drawing on their ideas in his own philosophy, in works such as &#x27; (&quot;The Theory of Intuition in Husserl&#x27;s Phenomenology&quot;; his 1929/30 doctoral thesis), &#x27; (&quot;From Existence to Existents&quot;; 1947), and &quot;&quot; (&quot;Discovering Existence with Husserl and Heidegger&quot;; first edition, 1949, with additions, 1967). In 1929, he was awarded his doctorate (&quot;Doctorat d&#x27;université&quot; degree) by the University of Strasbourg for his thesis on the meaning of intuition in the philosophy of Husserl, published in 1930.

Levinas became a naturalized French citizen in 1939. When France declared war on Germany, he reported for military duty as a translator of Russian and French. During the German invasion of France in 1940, his military unit was surrounded and forced to surrender. Levinas spent the rest of World War II as a prisoner of war in a camp near Hanover in Germany. Levinas was assigned to a special barrack for Jewish prisoners, who were forbidden any form of religious worship. Life in the Fallingbostel camp was difficult, but his status as a prisoner of war protected him from the Holocaust&#x27;s concentration camps. Other prisoners saw him frequently jotting in a notebook. These jottings were later developed into his book &quot;De l&#x27;Existence à l&#x27;Existant&quot; (1947) and a series of lectures published under the title &quot;Le Temps et l&#x27;Autre&quot; (1948). His wartime notebooks have now been published in their original form as &quot;Œuvres: Tome 1, Carnets de captivité: suivi de Écrits sur la captivité; et, Notes philosophiques diverses&quot; (2009).

Meanwhile, Maurice Blanchot helped Levinas&#x27;s wife and daughter spend the war in a monastery, thus sparing them from the Holocaust. Blanchot, at considerable personal risk, also saw to it that Levinas was able to keep in contact with his immediate family through letters and other messages. Other members of Levinas&#x27;s family were not so fortunate; his mother-in-law was deported and never heard from again, while his father and brothers were killed by the SS in Lithuania. After the Second World War, he studied the Talmud under the enigmatic Monsieur Chouchani, whose influence he acknowledged only late in his life.

Levinas&#x27;s first book-length essay, &quot;Totality and Infinity&quot; (1961), was written as his &quot;Doctorat d&#x27;État&quot; primary thesis (roughly equivalent to a Habilitation thesis). His secondary thesis was titled &quot;Études sur la phénoménologie&quot; (&quot;Studies on Phenomenology&quot;). After earning his habilitation, Levinas taught at a private Jewish High School in Paris, the , eventually becoming its director. He participated in 1957 at the International Meeting at the monastery of Toumliline, a conference focused on contemporary challenges and interfaith dialogue. Levinas began teaching at the University of Poitiers in 1961, at the Nanterre campus of the University of Paris in 1967, and at the Sorbonne in 1973, from which he retired in 1979. He published his second major philosophical work, &quot;Autrement qu&#x27;être ou au-delà de l&#x27;essence&quot;, in 1974. He was also a professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. In 1989, he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Philosophy.

According to his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Levinas came to regret his early enthusiasm for Heidegger, after the latter joined the Nazis. Levinas explicitly framed several of his mature philosophical works as attempts to respond to Heidegger&#x27;s philosophy in light of its ethical failings.
His son is the composer Michaël Levinas, and his son-in-law is the French mathematician Georges Hansel. Among his most famous students is Rabbi Baruch Garzon from Tetouan (Morocco), who studied with Levinas at the Sorbonne, and later went on to become one of the most important Rabbis of the Spanish-speaking world.

==Philosophy==
In the 1950s, Levinas emerged from the circle of intellectuals surrounding the philosopher Jean Wahl as a leading French thinker. His work is based on the ethics of the Other or, in Levinas&#x27;s terms, on &quot;ethics as first philosophy&quot;. For Levinas, the Other is not knowable and cannot be made into an object of the self, as is done by traditional metaphysics (which Levinas called &quot;ontology&quot;). Levinas prefers to think of philosophy as the &quot;wisdom of love&quot; rather than the &quot;love of wisdom&quot; (the usual translation of the Greek &quot;φιλοσοφία&quot;). In his view, responsibility towards the Other precedes any &quot;objective searching after truth&quot;.

Levinas derives the primacy of his ethics from the experience of the encounter with the Other. For Levinas, the irreducible relation, the epiphany, of the face-to-face, the encounter with another, is a privileged phenomenon in which the other person&#x27;s proximity and distance are both strongly felt. &quot;The Other precisely &quot;reveals&quot; himself in his alterity not in a shock negating the I, but as the primordial phenomenon of gentleness.&quot; At the same time, the revelation of the face makes a demand, and this demand is before one can express or know one&#x27;s freedom to affirm or deny. One instantly recognizes the transcendence and heteronomy of the Other. Even murder fails as an attempt to take hold of this otherness.

While critical of traditional theology, Levinas does require that a &quot;trace&quot; of the Divine be acknowledged within an ethics of Otherness. This is especially evident in his thematization of debt and guilt. &quot;A face is a trace of itself, given over to my responsibility, but to which I am wanting and faulty. It is as though I were responsible for his mortality, and guilty for surviving.&quot; The moral &quot;authority&quot; of the face of the Other is felt in my &quot;infinite responsibility&quot; for the Other. The face of the Other comes towards me with its infinite moral demands while emerging out of the trace.

Apart from this morally imposing emergence, the Other’s face might well be adequately addressed as &quot;Thou&quot; (along the lines proposed by Martin Buber) in whose welcoming countenance I might find great comfort, love and communion of souls—but not a moral demand bearing down upon me from a height. &quot;Through a trace the irreversible past takes on the profile of a ‘He.’ The beyond from which a face comes is in the third person.&quot; It is because the Other also emerges from the &quot;illeity&quot; of a He (&quot;il&quot; in French) that I instead fall into infinite debt vis-à-vis the Other in a situation of utterly asymmetrical obligations: I owe the Other everything, the Other owes me nothing. The trace of the Other is the heavy shadow of God, the God who commands, &quot;Thou shalt not kill!&quot; Levinas takes great pains to avoid straightforward theological language. The very metaphysics of signification subtending theological language is suspected and suspended by evocations of how traces work differently than signs. Nevertheless, the divinity of the trace is also undeniable: &quot;the trace is not just one more word: it is the proximity of God in the countenance of my fellowman.&quot; In a sense, it is divine commandment without divine authority.

Following &quot;Totality and Infinity&quot;, Levinas later argued that responsibility for the other is rooted within the subjective constitution. The first line of the preface of this book is &quot;everyone will readily agree that it is of the highest importance to know whether we are not duped by morality.&quot; This idea appears in his thoughts on recurrence (chapter 4 in &quot;Otherwise than Being&quot;), in which Levinas maintains that subjectivity is formed in and through subjection to the other. Subjectivity, Levinas argued, is primordially ethical, not theoretical: that is to say, responsibility for the other is not a derivative feature of subjectivity, but instead, &quot;founds&quot; subjective being-in-the-world by giving it a meaningful direction and orientation. Levinas&#x27;s thesis &quot;ethics as first philosophy&quot;, then, means that the traditional philosophical pursuit of knowledge is secondary to a basic ethical duty to the other. To meet the Other is to have the idea of Infinity.

The elderly Levinas was a distinguished French public intellectual, whose books reportedly sold well. He had a major influence on the younger, but more well-known Jacques Derrida, whose seminal &quot;Writing and Difference&quot; contains an essay, &quot;Violence and Metaphysics&quot;, that was instrumental in expanding interest in Levinas in France and abroad. Derrida also delivered a eulogy at Levinas&#x27;s funeral, later published as &quot;Adieu à Emmanuel Levinas&quot;, an appreciation and exploration of Levinas&#x27;s moral philosophy. In a memorial essay for Levinas, Jean-Luc Marion claimed that &quot;If one defines a great philosopher as someone without whom philosophy would not have been what it is, then in France there are two great philosophers of the 20th Century: Bergson and Lévinas.&quot;

His works have been a source of controversy since the 1950s, when Simone de Beauvoir criticized his account of the subject as being necessarily masculine, as defined against a feminine other. While other feminist philosophers like Tina Chanter and the artist-thinker Bracha L. Ettinger have defended him against this charge, increasing interest in his work in the 2000s brought a reevaluation of the possible misogyny of his account of the feminine, as well as a critical engagement with his French nationalism in the context of colonialism. Among the most prominent of these are critiques by Simon Critchley and Stella Sandford. However, there have also been responses which argue that these critiques of Levinas are misplaced.

==Cultural influence==
For three decades, Levinas gave short talks on Rashi, a medieval French rabbi, every Shabbat morning at the Jewish high school in Paris where he was the principal. This tradition strongly influenced many generations of students. 
Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, renowned Belgian filmmakers, have referred to Levinas as an important underpinning for their filmmaking ethics.

In his book &quot;Levinas and the Cinema of Redemption: Time, Ethics, and the Feminine&quot;, author Sam B. Girgus argues that Levinas has dramatically affected films involving redemption.

Magician Derren Brown&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Secrets&quot; references Levinas.

<text>Ferguson Arthur &quot;Fergie&quot; Jenkins CM (born December 13, 1942) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher and coach. He played Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1965 to 1983 for the Philadelphia Phillies, Chicago Cubs, Texas Rangers and Boston Red Sox.

Jenkins played the majority of his career for the Cubs. He was a National League (NL) and Cubs All-Star for three seasons, and in 1971, he was the first Canadian and Cubs pitcher to win a Cy Young Award. He was a 20-game winner for seven seasons, including six consecutive seasons for the Cubs. He was the NL leader in wins, in 1971, and the American League (AL) leader in wins, in 1974. Jenkins was also the NL leader in complete games in 1967, 1970, and 1971, and the AL leader in complete games in 1974. He led the NL in strikeouts in 1969 and had over 3,000 strikeouts during his career. His 284 victories are the most by a black pitcher in major league history.

Jenkins played basketball in the off-season for the Harlem Globetrotters from 1967 to 1969, and pitched two seasons in Canada for the minor league London Majors following his major league career. Jenkins became the first Canadian to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1991; he remained the only one until Larry Walker&#x27;s election in 2020.

==Early life==
Jenkins was born and raised in Chatham, Ontario, the only child of Delores Jackson and Ferguson Jenkins Sr. His father, a chef and chauffeur, was the son of immigrants from Barbados, while his mother was a descendant of captive Africans enslaved in America, who escaped through the Underground Railroad before settling in Southwestern Ontario. Both of his parents were good athletes; his father was an amateur boxer and semi-professional baseball player for the Chatham Coloured All-Stars.

A talented athlete, Jenkins competed in track and field, ice hockey, and basketball in his school years, lettering five times. When he began playing bantam baseball in his teens, he started out as a first baseman. He honed his pitching skills by throwing pieces of coal from a local coal yard, aiming at either an open ice chute or the gaps of passing boxcars. He was also encouraged to continue working on his pitching by Gene Dziadura, a former shortstop in the Chicago Cubs minor league system, and a Philadelphia Phillies scout. Many training sessions involving the two followed, until Jenkins graduated from high school.

==Professional baseball==

===MLB career===

====Early seasons====
In 1962, Jenkins was signed by Philadelphia Phillies scout Tony Lucadello. Jenkins made his major-league debut as a 22-year-old in 1965, as a relief pitcher. He was traded the following year to the Chicago Cubs, along with Adolfo Phillips and John Herrnstein, for pitchers Larry Jackson and Bob Buhl. Jenkins would become one of the best pitchers in the majors. In his first full year as a starter for the Cubs (1967), Jenkins recorded 20 wins while posting a 2.80 ERA and 236 strikeouts. He finished tied for second in the Cy Young Award voting, following Mike McCormick of the San Francisco Giants. He was also selected for the All-Star Game for the first time that season.
The following year his numbers improved; once again he won 20 games, his ERA dropped to 2.63 and his strikeout total increased to 260. Jenkins established a reputation for achieving his pitching feats and his statistics while spending most of his career pitching in a &quot;hitter&#x27;s ballpark&quot;—Wrigley Field in Chicago. Furthermore, in 1968, Jenkins lost five of his starts in 1–0 ballgames.

====1971 season====
Jenkins had his best season in 1971. On April 6, 1971, Jenkins started the Cubs&#x27; opening-day game. The Cubs defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 2–1 in 10 innings at Wrigley Field. Jenkins pitched the complete game for the Cubs, and Billy Williams hit a home run in the final inning for the victory. On September 1, 1971, Jenkins threw another complete game against the Montreal Expos and hit two home runs. The Cubs won the game 5–2. He was named NL Player of the Month (for the only time in his career) in July, with a 6–1 record, a 2.14 ERA, and 49 strikeouts.

That season, Jenkins threw a complete game in 30 of 39 starts and received a decision in 37 of them, finishing with a 24–13 record (.649). He walked only 37 batters versus 263 strikeouts across 325 innings. He played in the All-Star Game and finished seventh in MVP voting. Jenkins also posted a .478 slugging percentage, hitting six home runs and driving in 20 runs in just 115 at-bats.

Jenkins won the 1971 NL Cy Young Award. Jenkins was the first Cubs pitcher and the first Canadian to win the Cy Young Award (Quebec native Éric Gagné is the only other Canadian to match the feat). He received 17 of 24 first-place votes. He was outpitched in several statistical categories by New York Mets pitcher Tom Seaver, but Jenkins pitched in hitter-friendly Wrigley Field and Seaver worked in pitcher-friendly Shea Stadium.

====Later seasons====
In 1972, Jenkins completed his sixth consecutive season with 20 or more wins. By the middle of the following season, he expressed that he did not feel like playing baseball anymore. He finished the season, but registered a 14–16 win–loss record.

Jenkins was traded from the Cubs to the Texas Rangers for Bill Madlock and Vic Harris on October 25, 1973. Texas manager Billy Martin was pleased with the trade, describing Jenkins as a workhorse and a winner. In 1974, Jenkins achieved a personal best 25 wins during the season, setting a Rangers franchise record which still stands. He finished second in Cy Young Award voting for the second time in his career behind Catfish Hunter in a very close vote (90 points to Jenkins&#x27;s 75); surprisingly, Jenkins actually finished ahead of Hunter in MVP voting (118 points to Hunter&#x27;s 107), and his fifth-place finish on the MVP leader-board was the highest of his career. He was named the American League Comeback Player of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;.

Jenkins achieved his 250th win against the Oakland Athletics on May 23, 1980. Later that year, during a customs search in Toronto, Jenkins was found possessing 3.0 grams cocaine, 2.2 grams hashish, and 1.75 grams marijuana. In response, on September 8, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn suspended him indefinitely. However, Jenkins&#x27; suspension lasted only two weeks before, in an unprecedented action, an independent arbiter, Raymond Goetz, overturned the suspension and reinstated him and he returned to the league. Eventually, when he went to trial, the judge gave him an absolute discharge for lack of some evidence. Jenkins was not punished further by MLB for the incident, as he remained active until his retirement following the 1983 season. It has been suggested that this incident delayed his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

===Canadian baseball===

====Minor league====
Jenkins continued playing professional baseball in Canada after retiring from MLB in 1983 and pitched two seasons for the London Majors, a minor league team of the Intercounty Major Baseball League, operating in London, Ontario.

==Post-baseball==

Jenkins ran for the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1985 Ontario general election, in the riding of Windsor—Riverside, but placed third with 15% of the vote behind the NDP&#x27;s Dave Cooke.

==Legacy==
Jenkins led the league in wins twice (1971, 1974), fewest walks per 9 innings five times, complete games nine times, and home runs allowed seven times. He led the league in strikeouts once (1969, with 273). His streak of six straight seasons with 20 or more wins (1967–1972) is the longest streak in the major leagues since Warren Spahn performed the feat between 1956 and 1961.

Jenkins, fellow Cub Greg Maddux, Curt Schilling, and Pedro Martínez are the only major league pitchers to ever record more than 3,000 strikeouts with fewer than 1,000 walks. Only Robin Roberts and Jamie Moyer allowed more home runs over a career than Jenkins. Jenkins achieved his 3,000th strikeout on May 25, 1982, against Garry Templeton.

As a hitter, Jenkins posted a .165 batting average (148-for-896) with 54 runs, 13 home runs, 85 RBI and 41 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .954 fielding percentage.

Jenkins is one of the Black Aces, black pitchers with at least 20 wins in a single MLB season.

===Honours and awards===

In 1974, Jenkins, then with the Texas Rangers, became the first baseball player to win the Lou Marsh Trophy, an award given annually to Canada&#x27;s top athlete. He was also named the &quot;Canadian Press&quot; male athlete of the year four times (1967, 1968, 1971, and 1974).

In 1987, Jenkins was awarded the Order of Sport, marking his induction into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame. Jenkins was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987, and in 1991, became the first Canadian ever elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The 1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, held in Toronto, was dedicated to Jenkins; he threw out the ceremonial first pitch to conclude the pregame ceremonies. Jenkins was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1995, and was inducted onto Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2001. He was appointed the commissioner of the now-defunct Canadian Baseball League in 2003; the league&#x27;s Jenkins Cup went missing when the league folded and has been missing ever since. He was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame in 2004. In 2011, the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame created the Ferguson Jenkins Heritage Award in his honour to commemorate those one-of-a-kind events or special moments in time that so embellish the long history of sports in Ontario.

On December 17, 1979, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada for being &quot;Canada&#x27;s best-known major-league baseball player&quot;. Governor General Michaëlle Jean officiated at his investiture into the Order, which finally occurred on May 4, 2007, more than 27 years after he was appointed. On May 3, 2009, the Cubs retired jersey number 31 in honor of both Jenkins and Greg Maddux. On December 13, 2010, Canada Post announced Jenkins would be honoured in Canada with his own postage stamp. The stamp was issued on February 1, 2011, to commemorate Black History Month. On May 20, 2022, Jenkins was honored with a statue outside Wrigley Field.

==Personal life==
Jenkins had three daughters with his first wife, Kathy, whom he divorced in 1987.

Jenkins had one child, a daughter named Samantha, with his second wife, Maryanne. In December 1990, Maryanne broke her neck in a car accident near their ranch in Guthrie, Oklahoma. She died from pneumonia in January 1991.

In December 1992, Jenkins&#x27; girlfriend, Cynthia Takieddine, and Jenkins&#x27; three-year-old daughter, Samantha Jenkins, died of carbon monoxide poisoning in her car near Perry, Oklahoma. It was ruled a murder-suicide although Takieddine&#x27;s motives were not clear in the suicide note which did not mention Jenkins. It did say she loved Samantha and could not bear to leave her.

<text>Gilda Susan Radner (June 28, 1946 – May 20, 1989) was an American actress and comedian. She was one of the seven original cast members of the &quot;Not Ready for Prime Time Players&quot; on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from its inception in 1975 until her departure in 1980. In her sketches on &quot;SNL&quot;, she specialized in parodies of television stereotypes, such as advice specialists and news anchors. She also played various original characters. In 1978, Radner won an Emmy Award for her performances on the show. She also portrayed those characters in her highly successful one-woman show &quot;Gilda, Live&quot; on Broadway in 1979 and later on film in 1980.

After leaving &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, she appeared in various films, including three with her future husband Gene Wilder, with whom she first appeared in 1982&#x27;s &quot;Hanky Panky.&quot; She also worked on stage, appearing in the play &quot;Lunch Hour&quot; with Sam Waterston in 1980. She also continued to work on network and premium cable television, making appearances on Lorne Michaels&#x27; &quot;The New Show&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot;.

She died of ovarian cancer in 1989. Shortly before her death, she published her autobiography &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something,&quot; which dealt frankly with her life, work, and personal struggles, including her struggles with the illness. Her widower, Gene Wilder, carried out her wish that information about her illness would be used to help other people living with cancer, founding—and inspiring the founding of—organizations that emphasize early diagnosis, attention to hereditary factors, and support for cancer patients. 

Posthumously, Radner won a Grammy Award in 1990, was inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1992, and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003. Other comedians have cited Radner as an influence on their work.

==Early life==
Radner was born in Detroit, Michigan, to Jewish parents Henrietta (née Dworkin), a legal secretary, and Herman Radner, a businessman. In Radner&#x27;s autobiography, she stated, &quot;I was named after my grandmother whose name began with &quot;G&quot;, but &#x27;Gilda&#x27; came directly from the movie with Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth.&quot; Through her mother, Radner was a second cousin of business executive Steve Ballmer. She grew up in Detroit and spent the winters in Miami Beach, Florida along with the family&#x27;s nanny, Elizabeth Clementine Gillies, whom she called &quot;Dibby&quot; (and upon whom she based her famous character Emily Litella), and an older brother, Michael. She attended the University Liggett School in Grosse Pointe Woods.

Radner wrote in her autobiography, &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;, that during her childhood and young adulthood, she battled numerous eating disorders: &quot;I coped with stress by having every possible eating disorder from the time I was nine years old. I have weighed as much as 160 pounds and as little as 93. When I was a kid, I overate constantly. My weight distressed my mother and she took me to a doctor who put me on Dexedrine diet pills when I was ten years old.&quot;

Radner was close to her father, who operated Detroit&#x27;s Seville Hotel, where many nightclub performers and actors stayed while performing in the city. He took her on trips to New York to see Broadway shows. As Radner wrote in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;, when she was 12, her father developed a brain tumor. The first symptoms came on suddenly: he told people his glasses were too tight. Within days, he was bedridden and unable to communicate, and remained in that condition until his death two years later. Radner said of her father, &quot;My dad was real funny ... he loved to sing ... and tap dance. I feel that some part of my father is back alive in me, back doing what he always wanted to do.&quot;

In 1964, Radner graduated from Liggett and enrolled at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Sources vary on what she majored in; Radner said in her autobiography she majored in public speaking, while other sources said she majored in drama or education. While in college, Radner did weather reports at WCBN, the university&#x27;s radio station. According to her friend David Saltman in his book &quot;Gilda: An Intimate Portrait,&quot; she would report on the weather in humorous ways, such as imitating a radio static. She also took part in theater productions on and off campus.

==Career==
In her senior year at the University of Michigan, Radner dropped out to follow her boyfriend, Canadian sculptor Jeffrey Rubinoff, to Toronto. Radner was quoted in 1973 as saying that Toronto was &quot;the answer to my dreams. It&#x27;s a young city, open to new ideas and there are incredible opportunities for creative people.&quot; There, she made her professional acting debut in the 1972 production of &quot;Godspell&quot;, with future stars Eugene Levy, Andrea Martin, Victor Garber, Martin Short, and Paul Shaffer. Afterward, Radner joined The Second City comedy troupe in Toronto. She appeared in a small part as a Buddhist group member in the 1973 film &quot;The Last Detail&quot;, starring Jack Nicholson and future film luminaries Randy Quaid, Carol Kane, and Michael Moriarty. She also appeared on various children&#x27;s shows on CBC.

From 1974 to 1975, Radner was a featured player on the &quot;National Lampoon Radio Hour&quot;, a comedy program syndicated to some 600 U.S. radio stations. Fellow cast members included John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Richard Belzer, Bill Murray, Brian Doyle-Murray, and Rhonda Coullet.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===

Radner gained wide recognition in 1975 as one of the original &quot;Not Ready for Prime Time Players,&quot; the freshman cast of the first season of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She was the first performer to be cast in the show, choosing the show over doing &quot;The David Steinberg Show&quot; in Canada. Radner co-wrote much of the material that she performed and collaborated with Alan Zweibel (of the show&#x27;s writing staff) on the development of sketches that featured her recurring characters. Between 1975 and 1980, she created many characters, such as the obnoxious personal advice expert Roseanne Roseannadanna (modeled after a New York reporter, Rose Ann Scamardella) and &quot;Baba Wawa&quot;, a parody of Barbara Walters. After Radner&#x27;s death, Walters noted in an interview that Radner had been the &quot;first person to make fun of news anchors, now it&#x27;s done all the time.&quot;

Another of Radner&#x27;s invented characters was Emily Litella, an elderly, hard of hearing editorialist who made irate, misinformed comments in interview sketches on &quot;SNL&quot;&#x27;s recurring &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment. Radner also parodied celebrities such as Lucille Ball, Patti Smith, and Olga Korbut in &quot;SNL&quot; sketches. In 1978, she won an Emmy Award for her work on &quot;SNL&quot;.

Radner battled bulimia while on the show. She had a relationship with fellow &quot;SNL&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&quot; castmate Bill Murray, which reportedly ended badly, though few details of their relationship or its end were made public. In her autobiography, Radner mentioned Murray only once, and in passing: &quot;All the guys [in the &quot;National Lampoon&quot; group of writers and performers] liked to have me around because I would laugh at them till I peed in my pants and tears rolled out of my eyes. We worked together for a couple of years creating &quot;The National Lampoon Show,&quot; writing &quot;The National Lampoon Radio Hour,&quot; and even working on stuff for the magazine. Bill Murray joined the show and Richard Belzer...&quot;

In 1979, the new president and CEO of NBC, Fred Silverman, offered Radner a primetime variety show, but she turned down the offer, not wanting to add another five years to her contract and not wanting to leave &quot;SNL&quot;. That same year, she was a host of the Music for UNICEF Concert at the United Nations General Assembly. Radner also gave the commencement address, in character as Roseanne Roseannadanna, to the 1979 graduating class at the Columbia School of Journalism.

Radner reportedly expressed mixed emotions about being recognized and approached in public by fans and other strangers. &quot;SNL&quot; historians Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad said she became &quot;angry when she was approached, and upset when she wasn&#x27;t&quot;.

===Broadway show===
In 1979, Radner appeared on Broadway in a successful one-woman show, &quot;Gilda Radner – Live from New York&quot;. The show featured material that was racier than NBC censors would allow on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, such as the song &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Dirty to the Animals.&quot; The same year, shortly before Radner&#x27;s final season on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, her Broadway show was filmed by Mike Nichols and released with the title &quot;Gilda Live&quot;. It co-starred Paul Shaffer and Don Novello, and screened in theaters nationwide in 1980, but was a box-office flop. A soundtrack album was also commercially unsuccessful.

== Post &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; career ==

=== Roles in films ===
In 1980, Radner&#x27;s contract with &quot;SNL&quot; expired and she left the show, along with Lorne Michaels and the rest of the cast. After leaving, Radner saw an opportunity to pursue new acting opportunities.

Radner&#x27;s first film after leaving the show was 1980&#x27;s &quot;First Family&quot;, with Bob Newhart and Madeline Khan. Radner played the sexually frustrated daughter of the President of the United States. The film was unsuccessful. In 1982, she appeared in the Sidney Poitier directed film &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, alongside Gene Wilder. Subsequently, she would appear in two more films with Wilder, 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Woman in Red&quot;, and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Haunted Honeymoon.&quot; The three films were not particularly successful, though &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; performed adequately at the box office, and had the Academy Award winning song &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot; by Stevie Wonder. In her autobiography, Radner described &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; as &quot;not-too-successful,&quot; &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; as &quot;a nice enough success,&quot; and &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot; as &quot;a bomb...a box-office disaster.&quot;

Radner&#x27;s &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Laraine Newman said in a 2018 interview that she believed Radner&#x27;s movie career had turned out to be mostly disappointing. According to Newman, this was because directors and producers did not know how to cast Radner in roles where her talents could best shine. &quot;The specific nature of her talent was she did characters, and she would probably have been better served if she had taken part in writing the things that she did,&quot; Newman asserted. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think it occurred to her. If she and Alan Zweibel had collaborated on a feature, it might have been a whole different thing.&quot;

=== Other work ===
Outside of film, Radner continued to work in different mediums. In 1981, Radner began appearing, with Sam Waterston in the Jean Kerr play &quot;Lunch Hour&quot;. They played two people whose spouses are having an affair, and who, in retaliation, begin an affair of their own consisting of lunch-hour trysts. The show ran for more than seven months, playing in various US theaters, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. Newspaper critics, including Tom Shales, praised both the play and Radner&#x27;s performance. In 1983, she, along with Alan Zweibel, wrote &quot;Roseanne Roseannadanna&#x27;s &quot;Hey Get Back to Work!&quot; Book&quot;. She continued to work on television, as well. In 1984, Radner appeared on an episode of Lorne Michaels&#x27; &quot;The New Show&quot;, a sketch comedy show featuring Valri Bromfield, John Candy, and Dave Thomas among others. 

== Personal life ==

After breaking up with Jeffrey Rubinoff, Radner had an on-again-off-again relationship with Martin Short while both were appearing in &quot;Godspell&quot;. Radner had romantic involvements with several &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; castmates, including Bill Murray (after a previous romance with his brother Brian Doyle-Murray) and Dan Aykroyd. Radner&#x27;s friend Judy Levy recounted Radner saying she found &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; hard to watch since the cast included so many of her ex-boyfriends: Aykroyd, Murray, and Harold Ramis. Radner was married to musician G. E. Smith from 1980 to 1982; they met while working on her Broadway show. The two lived in the The Dakota building in Manhattan. After the shooting of John Lennon in 1980 and the death of John Belushi in 1982, Radner moved to Stamford, Connecticut.

Radner met actor Gene Wilder on the set of &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, when the two worked together making the film. She described their first meeting as &quot;love at first sight&quot;. After she met Wilder, her marriage to Smith deteriorated. Radner made a second film with Wilder, &quot;The Woman in Red&quot; (released in 1984), and their relationship deepened. The two were married on September 18, 1984, in Saint-Tropez. They made a third film together, &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;, in 1986 and remained married until her death in 1989. She discovered she was pregnant during the filming of &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;, but miscarried early in the pregnancy.

Details of Radner&#x27;s eating disorder were reported in a book about &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad, which was published and received much media coverage during a period when Radner was consulting various doctors in Los Angeles about symptoms of an illness she was suffering that turned out to be cancer.

==Illness==
In 1985, while on the set of &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot; in the United Kingdom, Radner began experiencing severe fatigue, and pain in her upper legs. She sought medical treatment, and for a period of 10 months, various doctors, most of them in Los Angeles, gave her several diagnoses that all turned out to be wrong; meanwhile, she continued to experience pain.

During those 10 months, she also faced hardships such as the publication of Hill and Weingrad&#x27;s highly publicized book about &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which provided many details about her eating disorder as well as the financial failure of &quot;Haunted Honeymoon&quot;, which had grossed only $8,000,000 in the United States, entering the box-office-returns ranking at number 8, then slipping to 14 the following week.

Finally, on October 21, 1986, Radner was diagnosed with stage IV ovarian cancer. She immediately underwent surgery and had a hysterectomy. On October 26, surgeons removed a grapefruit-size tumor from her abdomen. Radner then began chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatment, as she wrote in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;, and the treatment caused extreme physical and emotional pain.

After her diagnosis, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; ran the headline &quot;Gilda Radner In Life-Death Struggle&quot; in its following issue. Without asking for her comment, the editors of the publication asserted that she was dying. Radner wrote in &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;:
Radner saw her &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; castmates one last time at Laraine Newman&#x27;s 36th birthday party (in March 1988). According to Bill Murray, when he heard she was about to leave the party, he and Dan Aykroyd carried her around the Los Angeles house where the party was held so that she could say goodbye to everyone, and so that she wouldn&#x27;t leave, as described by Bill Murray in detail in the book &quot;Live from New York.&quot;

===Remission===
After Radner was told that she had gone into remission, she wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Always Something&quot; (a catchphrase of her character Roseanne Roseannadanna), which included details of her struggle with the illness. &quot;Life&quot; did a March 1988 cover story on her illness, titled &quot;Gilda Radner&#x27;s Answer to Cancer: Healing the Body with Mind and Heart.&quot; 

Wanting to return to television, Radner guest-starred on &quot;It&#x27;s Garry Shandling&#x27;s Show&quot; on March 18, 1988, unannounced, mentioning on-camera that a cancer diagnosis and treatment explained the long hiatus in her entertainment career. According to Alan Zweibel, Radner had been nervous about appearing on the show, worrying that she had been out of the spotlight so long that no one would remember her. When she came on the show, she received a loud applause. This was Radner&#x27;s final TV appearance. After the appearance, the HBO president Michael Fuchs discussed the possibility of giving Radner a new show created by Zweibel and Shandling.

Radner was scheduled to host an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in the spring of 1988, which would have made her the first female former cast member to host the show, but the writers&#x27; strike forced production to shut down before the end of the season.

===Recurrence, death, and &quot;SNL&quot; response===
In September 1988, after tests showed no signs of cancer, Radner went on a maintenance chemotherapy treatment to prolong her remission, but three months later, in December, she learned the cancer had returned.

On May 17, 1989, she was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to undergo a CT scan. She was given a sedative and lapsed into a coma during the scan. She did not regain consciousness and died three days later, on May 20, 1989; Wilder was at her side. The cause of death was ovarian cancer.

News of Radner&#x27;s death broke as Steve Martin was rehearsing for his guest-host role on that night&#x27;s season finale of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The show&#x27;s performers and crew, including Lorne Michaels, Phil Hartman, and Mike Myers (who had, in his own words, &quot;fallen in love&quot; with Radner after playing her son in a BC Hydro commercial on Canadian television and considered her the reason he wanted to be on &quot;SNL&quot;), had been unaware of the severity of Radner&#x27;s condition. 

Martin abandoned his opening monologue, and tearfully introduced a video clip of a 1978 sketch in which he and Radner had parodied Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in the well-known dance routine &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; from &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953). After the clip, Martin said it reminded him of &quot;how great she was, and of how young I looked. Gilda, we miss you.&quot; G. E. Smith, Radner&#x27;s first husband, who was &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;&#x27;s bandleader, wore a black armband throughout the episode.

Radner was interred at Long Ridge Union Cemetery in Stamford, Connecticut.

==Legacy==
=== Legacy in comedy ===
In &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s February 2015 appraisal of all 141 &quot;SNL&quot; cast members to date, Radner was ranked ninth in importance. &quot;[Radner was] the most beloved of the original cast,&quot; they wrote. &quot;In the years between Mary Tyler Moore and &quot;Seinfeld&#x27;s&quot; Elaine, Radner was the prototype for the brainy city girl with a bundle of neuroses.&quot;

Radner has been cited as an influence by many writers and comedians such as Lena Dunham, Melissa McCarthy, Amy Poehler, and Maya Rudolph. At the premiere for the documentary film &quot;Love, Gilda&quot;, Tina Fey said &quot;She was our equivalent to Michelle Obama. She was so lovely and she was so authentically herself and so regular in so many ways … We all saw that and said: &#x27;I wanna do that.&#x27;&quot;

=== Legacy in cancer awareness and treatment ===
Radner&#x27;s death helped raise awareness of the early detection of ovarian cancer and the connection to familial epidemiology. The media attention in the two years after Radner&#x27;s death led to registry of 450 families with familial ovarian cancer at the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry, a research database registry at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, New York. The registry was renamed the Gilda Radner Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry (GRFOCR) in 1990 and renamed the Familial Ovarian Cancer Registry in 2013. In 1996, Wilder and Registry founder Steven Piver, one of Radner&#x27;s medical consultants, published &quot;Gilda&#x27;s Disease: Sharing Personal Experiences and a Medical Perspective on Ovarian Cancer&quot;.

Wilder established the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program at Cedars-Sinai to screen high-risk candidates (such as women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent) and to run basic diagnostic tests. He testified before a Congressional committee that Radner&#x27;s condition had been misdiagnosed and that if doctors had inquired more deeply into her family background they would have learned that her grandmother, aunt, and a cousin had all died of ovarian cancer, and therefore they might have attacked the disease earlier.

In 1991, Gilda&#x27;s Club, a network of affiliated clubhouses where people living with cancer, their friends, and families, can meet to learn how to live with cancer, was founded by Joanna Bull, Radner&#x27;s cancer psychotherapist, along with Radner&#x27;s widower, Gene Wilder (also a cancer survivor) and broadcaster Joel Siegel (who would die in 2007 following a long battle with colon cancer). The first club opened in New York City in 1995. The organization took its name from Radner&#x27;s comment that cancer gave her &quot;membership to an elite club I&#x27;d rather not belong to&quot;.

Many Gilda&#x27;s Clubs have opened across the United States and in Canada. In July 2009, Gilda&#x27;s Club Worldwide merged with The Wellness Community, another established cancer support organization, to become the Cancer Support Community (CSC). As of 2012, more than 20 local affiliates of Gilda&#x27;s Club were active. Although some local affiliates of Gilda&#x27;s Club and The Wellness Community have retained their names, many affiliates have adopted the name Cancer Support Community following the merger.

=== Other tributes ===
In 1997, &quot;Bunny , Bunny: Gilda Radner: A Sort of Romantic Comedy&quot;, Alan Zweibel&#x27;s play about his friendship with Radner (based on his memoir with the same name) ran for 73 performances at New York&#x27;s off-Broadway Lucille Lortel Theatre. Paula Cale played Gilda, Bruno Kirby played Zwiebel, and all the other roles (more than twenty) were played by Alan Tudyk in his New York stage debut (a feat for which he won the Clarence Derwent Award).

In 2002, ABC dedicated a three-hour block of programming to Radner. The evening kicked off with a one-hour special, &quot;Gilda Radner&#x27;s Greatest Moments&quot;. Hosted by &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumnus Molly Shannon, the special featured highlights from her career and appearances by friends and co-stars Victor Garber, Kermit the Frog, Eugene Levy, Steve Martin, Paul Shaffer, Lily Tomlin, and Barbara Walters. It was followed by a television movie about her life: &quot;Gilda Radner: It&#x27;s Always Something&quot;, starring Jami Gertz as Radner.

In 2007, Radner was featured in &quot;Making Trouble&quot;, a film tribute to female Jewish comedians produced by the Jewish Women&#x27;s Archive.

In 2015, for the &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; 40th Anniversary Special, Radner was honored with other deceased cast and crew members over the show&#x27;s history. Additionally, during the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; segment, Emma Stone played Roseanne Roseannadanna as a tribute to Radner.

Actress Ella Hunt portrays Radner in the 2024 film &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Radner won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actress in Variety or Music&quot; for her performance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1978. She posthumously won a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Spoken Word Or Non-Musical Recording&quot; in 1990. In 1992, Radner was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame for her achievements in arts and entertainment.Producer/actor James Tumminia spearheaded a campaign to dedicate a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame to Radner. On June 27, 2003, Radner received her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6801 Hollywood Blvd. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; alumna Molly Shannon (and the host of the ABC special) served as Master of Ceremonies at the induction ceremony at which Laraine Newman, Gilda&#x27;s Club founder Joanna Bull, and Radner&#x27;s brother, Michael F. Radner, presented the honor.

Parts of West Houston Street in New York City, Lombard Street in Toronto, and Chester Avenue in White Plains, New York, have been renamed &quot;Gilda Radner Way&quot;. The private road off Kirk Road in Warminster Township, Pennsylvania, leading to the Cancer Support Community Greater Philadelphia (formerly Gilda&#x27;s Club Delaware Valley) is also thus named.

<text>Errico Malatesta (4 December 1853 – 22 July 1932) was an Italian anarchist propagandist, theorist and revolutionary socialist. He edited several radical newspapers and spent much of his life exiled and imprisoned, having been jailed and expelled from Italy, Britain, France, and Switzerland. Originally a supporter of insurrectionary propaganda by deed, Malatesta later advocated for syndicalism. His exiles included five years in Europe and 12 years in Argentina. Malatesta participated in actions including an 1895 Spanish revolt and a Belgian general strike. He toured the United States, giving lectures and founding the influential anarchist journal &quot;La Questione Sociale&quot;. After World War I, he returned to Italy where his &quot;Umanità Nova&quot; had some popularity before its closure under the rise of Mussolini.

== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
Errico Malatesta was born on 4 December 1853 to a family of middle-class landowners in Santa Maria Maggiore, at the time part of the city of Capua (currently an autonomous municipality renamed Santa Maria Capua Vetere, in the province of Caserta), at the time part of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. More distantly, his ancestors ruled Rimini as the House of Malatesta. The first of a long series of arrests came at age fourteen, when he was apprehended for writing an &quot;insolent and threatening&quot; letter to King Victor Emmanuel II.

In April 1877, Malatesta, Carlo Cafiero, Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky and about thirty others started an insurrection in the province of Benevento, taking the villages of Letino and Gallo without a struggle. The revolutionaries burnt tax registers and declared the end of the King&#x27;s reign and were met with enthusiasm. After leaving Gallo, however, they were arrested by government troops and held for sixteen months before being acquitted. After Giovanni Passannante&#x27;s murder attempt on the king Umberto I, the radicals were kept under constant surveillance by the police. Even though the anarchists claimed to have no connection to Passannante, Malatesta, being an advocate of social revolution, was included in this surveillance. After returning to Naples, he was forced to leave Italy altogether in the fall of 1878 because of the intense surveillance, beginning his life in exile.

=== Years of exile ===

He went to Egypt briefly, visiting some Italian friends but was soon expelled by the Italian Consul. After working his passage on a French ship and being refused entry to Syria, Turkey and Italy, he landed in Marseille where he made his way to Geneva, Switzerland – then something of an anarchist centre. It was there that he befriended Élisée Reclus and Peter Kropotkin, helping the latter to produce &quot;La Révolte.&quot; The Swiss respite was brief, however, and after a few months he was expelled from Switzerland, travelling first to Romania before reaching Paris, where he worked briefly as a mechanic.

In 1881, he set out for a new home in London. He would come and go from that city for the next 40 years. There, Malatesta worked as a mechanic. Emilia Tronzio, Malatesta&#x27;s mistress in the 1870s, was the step-sister of the internationalist Tito Zanardelli.
With Malatesta&#x27;s consent and support she married Giovanni Defendi, who came to stay with Malatesta in London in 1881 after being released from jail.

Malatesta attended the July 1881 Anarchist Congress in London. Other delegates included Peter Kropotkin, Francesco Saverio Merlino, Marie Le Compte, Louise Michel and Émile Gautier. While respecting &quot;complete autonomy of local groups&quot; the congress defined propaganda actions that all could follow and agreed that &quot;propaganda by the deed&quot; was the path to social revolution.

With the outbreak of the Anglo-Egyptian War in 1882, Malatesta organised a small group to help fight against the British. In August, he and three other men departed for Egypt. They landed in Abu Qir, then travelled towards Ramleh, Alexandria. After a difficult crossing of Lake Mariout, they were surrounded and detained by British forces, without having undertaken any fighting. He secretly returned to Italy the following year.

In Florence he founded the weekly anarchist paper (&quot;The Social Question&quot;) in which his most popular pamphlet, (&quot;Among Farmers&quot;), first appeared. Malatesta went back to Naples in 1884—while waiting to serve a three-year prison term—to nurse the victims of a cholera epidemic. Once again, he fled Italy to escape imprisonment, this time heading for South America. He lived in Buenos Aires from 1885 until 1889, resuming publication of and spreading anarchist ideas among the Italian émigré community there. He was involved in the founding of the first militant workers&#x27; union in Argentina and left an anarchist impression in the workers&#x27; movements there for years to come.

Returning to Europe in 1889, Malatesta first published a newspaper called in Nice, remaining there until he was once again forced to flee to London.

=== Arrest in Italy ===

The late 1890s were a time of social turmoil in Italy, marked by bad harvests, rising prices, and peasant revolts. Strikes of workers were met by demands for repression and for a time it seemed as though government authority was hanging by a thread. Malatesta found the situation irresistible and early in 1898 he returned to the port city of Ancona to take part in the blossoming anarchist movement among the dockworkers there. Malatesta was soon identified as a leader during street fighting with police and arrested; he was therefore unable to participate further in the dramatic industrial and political actions of 1898 and 1899.

From jail, Malatesta took a hard line against participation in elections on behalf of liberal and socialist politicians, contradicting Saverio Merlino and other anarchist leaders who argued in favor of electoral participation as an emergency measure during times of social turmoil. Malatesta was convicted of &quot;seditious association&quot; and sentenced to a term of imprisonment on the island of Lampedusa. 

=== Escape and later life ===
He was able to escape from prison in May 1899 and he made his way home to London via Malta and Gibraltar. His escape occurred with the help of comrades around the world, including anarchists in Paterson, New Jersey, London and Tunis, who helped arrange for him to leave the island on a ship of Greek sponge fishermen, who took him to Sousse.

In subsequent years, Malatesta visited the United States, speaking there to anarchists in the Italian and Spanish immigrant communities. Home again in London, he was closely watched by the police, who increasingly regarded anarchists as a threat following the July 1900 assassination of Umberto I by an Italian anarchist who had been living in Paterson, New Jersey.

In 1902, the founding congress of the Unión Obrera Democrática Filipina - first national trade union federation in the Philippines - adopted Malatesta&#x27;s book &quot;Between Peasants&quot; as being part of the political foundation of the movement.

=== Return to London ===
By 1910, he had opened an electrical workshop in London at 15 Duncan Terrace Islington and allowed the jewel thief George Gardenstein to use his premises. On 15 January 1910, he sold oxyacetylene cutting equipment for £5 (£500 at 2013 monetary values) to George Gardenstein so that he could break into the safe at H. S. Harris jewellers Houndsditch. Gardenstein led the gang that mounted the abortive Houndsditch robbery that is the precursor to the Siege of Sidney Street. Malatesta&#x27;s cutting gear is on permanent display at the City of London Police museum at Wood Street police station.

While based in London, Malatesta made clandestine trips to France, Switzerland and Italy and went on a lecture tour of Spain with Fernando Tarrida del Mármol. During this time, he wrote several important pamphlets, including &quot;L&#x27;Anarchia&quot;. Malatesta then took part in the International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam (1907), where he debated in particular with Pierre Monatte on the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade unionism. The latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution, while Malatesta considered that syndicalism by itself was not sufficient.

After the First World War, Malatesta eventually returned to Italy for the final time. Two years after his return, in 1921, the Italian government imprisoned him, again, although he was released two months before the fascists came to power. From 1924 until 1926, when Benito Mussolini silenced all independent press, Malatesta published the journal &quot;Pensiero e Volontà&quot;, although he was harassed and the journal suffered from government censorship. He was to spend his remaining years leading a relatively quiet life, earning a living as an electrician. After years of suffering from a weak respiratory system and regular bronchial attacks, he developed bronchial pneumonia from which he died after a few weeks, despite being given 1,500 litres of oxygen in his last five hours. He died on Friday 22 July 1932. He was an atheist.

== Political beliefs ==

David Goodway writes that Malatesta held a &quot;Mazzini-like role&quot; and was &quot;the leader of the Italian anarchist movement during its most important years. While other leaders of the International changed their opinions or abandoned politics, Malatesta remained firm in his original convictions for a half-century&quot;. In this sense, only Malatesta &quot;remained devoted to anarchism by the end of the 1870s&quot;. Goodway argues that Malatesta was able to do so &quot;by modifying his optimistic approach, substituting one of the more sophisticated versions of anarchism&quot;. Goodway writes that Malatesta developed &quot;a two-pronged strategy&quot; by the 1880s and early 1900s. Malatesta sought on one hand &quot;to unify the anarchist and anti-parliamentary socialists into a new anarchist socialist party&quot; as &quot;anarchism was a minority movement within the Italian left&quot;, hence &quot;Malatesta and his followers hoped to galvanize the elements of regional socialist group (the Fasci Siciliani, the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Romagna, and the Partito Operaio) into a new anti-parliamentary socialist party&quot;. On the other hand, Malatesta was &quot;one of the first anarchists to stress a syndicalist strategy&quot; and anarchists &quot;had to prod the socialists into insurrections and remain a revolutionary conscience afterwards during socialist reconstruction&quot;. Goodway further writes that &quot;Malatesta defined this type of anarchist communism as &#x27;anarchism without adjectives&#x27;&quot;, described by Goodway as &quot;a concept which he had developed with a group of Spanish anarchist intellectuals in the process mediating between mutually hostile collectivists and communists&quot;. In stressing &quot;tolerance within the libertarian movement&quot;, Malatesta hoped that &quot;Marxist socialists would permit the anarchists liberty for their own movement in post-revolutionary society&quot;.

According to Davide Turcato, the label &quot;anarchist socialism&quot; came to characterize Malatesta&#x27;s brand of anarchism as he &quot;proclaimed the socialist character of anarchism and urged anarchists to regain contact with the working masses, especially through involvement in the labor movement&quot;. For Malatesta, &quot;demanding the anarchists&#x27; admission to the congress meant reasserting socialism and labor movement as central to anarchism; conversely, the Marxists&#x27; effort to exclude anarchists aimed at denying that they had a place among socialist and workers&quot;. According to Turcato, &quot;Malatesta&#x27;s struggle for admission to the congress was a statement of his new tactics&quot;. Turcato writes how &quot;Malatesta recalled in the &quot;Labour Leader&quot; that in the old International both Marxists and Bakuninists wished to make their program triumph. In the struggle between centralism and federalism, class struggle and economic solidarity got neglected, and the International perished in the process. In contrast, anarchists were not presently demanding anyone to renounce their program. They only asked for divisions to be left out of the economic struggle, where they had no reason to exists (&#x27;Should&#x27;)&quot;. In other words, &quot;the issue was no longer hegemony, but the contrast between an exclusive view of socialism, for which one political idea was to be hegemonic, and an inclusive one, for which multiple political views were to coexist, united in the economic struggle. [...] The matter of the question had changed: the controversy was no longer with the anarchists, but about the anarchists&quot;.

Anarchists who influenced Malatesta&#x27;s political beliefs included Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, Carlo Cafiero, Peter Kropotkin and Élisée Reclus. In turn, Malatesta&#x27;s works influenced Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci and anarcha-feminist activist Virginia Bolten, as well as the Argentine Regional Workers&#x27; Federation and wider Argentine anarchist movement.

=== On labour unions ===
Malatesta argued with Pierre Monatte at the Amsterdam Conference of 1907 against pure syndicalism. Malatesta thought that trade unions were reformist and could even be at times conservative. Along with Christiaan Cornelissen, he cited as example labor unions in the United States, where trade unions composed of skilled qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to un-skilled workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have overthrowing capitalism and the state, the anarchist ideal of communist society as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.

Malatesta&#x27;s arguments against the doctrine of revolutionary unions known as anarcho-syndicalism were later developed in a series of articles, where he wrote that &quot;I am against syndicalism, both as a doctrine and a practice, because it strikes me as a hybrid creature.&quot; Despite their drawbacks, he advocated activity in the trade unions, both because they were necessary for the organization and self-defense of workers under a capitalist state regime, and as a way of reaching broader masses. Anarchists should have discussion groups in unions, as in factories, barracks and schools, but &quot;anarchists should not want the unions to be anarchist.&quot;

Malatesta thought that &quot;[s]yndicalism ... is by nature reformist&quot; like all unions. While anarchists should be active in the rank and file, he said &quot;any anarchist who has agreed to become a permanent and salaried official of a trade union is lost to anarchism.&quot; While some anarchists wanted to split from conservative unions to form revolutionary syndicalist unions, Malatesta predicted they would either remain an &quot;affinity group&quot; with no influence, or go through the same process of bureaucratization as the unions they left.

<doc id="90706" wikidata="Q189703" url="?curid=90706" title="Goethite">
<text>Goethite (, ) is a mineral of the diaspore group, consisting of iron(III) oxide-hydroxide, specifically the α-polymorph. It is found in soil and other low-temperature environments such as sediment. Goethite has been well known since ancient times for its use as a pigment (brown ochre). Evidence has been found of its use in paint pigment samples taken from the caves of Lascaux in France. It was first described in 1806 based on samples found in the Hollertszug Mine in Herdorf, Germany. The mineral was named after the German polymath and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832).

== Composition ==
Goethite is an iron oxyhydroxide containing ferric iron. It is the main component of rust and bog iron ore. Goethite&#x27;s hardness ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 on the Mohs Scale, and its specific gravity varies from 3.3 to 4.3. The mineral forms prismatic needle-like crystals (&quot;needle ironstone&quot;) but is more typically massive.

Feroxyhyte and lepidocrocite are both polymorphs of the iron oxyhydroxide FeO(OH) which are stable at the pressure and temperature conditions of the Earth&#x27;s surface. Although they have the same chemical formula as goethite, their different crystalline structures make them distinct minerals.

Additionally, goethite has several high-pressure and high-temperature polymorphs, which may be relevant to the conditions of the Earth&#x27;s interior. These include ε-FeOOH, which has an orthorhombic crystal structure, a cubic pyrite-type polymorph with or without losing hydrogen and an ultradense hexagonal structure.

Goethite has the same crystal structure as diaspore, the analogous aluminium oxide-hydroxide mineral. Oxygen and hydroxide ions form a hexagonal close-packed structure, with iron ions filling octahedral sites between the anions. The sites filled by iron ions form paired chains running the length of the crystal, with the two chains in each pair joined by hydroxide ions.

== Formation ==

Goethite often forms through the weathering of other iron-rich minerals, and thus is a common component of soils, concentrated in laterite soils. nanoparticulate authigenic goethite is a common diagenetic iron oxyhydroxide in both marine and lake sediments. The formation of goethite is marked by the oxidation state change of Fe2+ (ferrous) to Fe3+ (ferric), which allows for goethite to exist at surface conditions. Because of this oxidation state change, goethite is commonly seen as a pseudomorph. As iron-bearing minerals are brought to the zone of oxidation within the soil, the iron turns from iron(II) to iron(III), while the original shape of the parent mineral is retained. Common goethite pseudomorphs include pyrite, siderite, and marcasite, though any iron(II)-bearing mineral could become a goethite pseudomorph if proper conditions are met. It may also be precipitated by groundwater or in other sedimentary conditions, or form as a primary mineral in hydrothermal deposits. Goethite has also been found to be produced by the excretion processes of certain bacteria types.

== Distribution ==
Goethite is found all over the planet, usually in the form of concretions, stalactitic formations, oolites (a form consisting of tiny round grains cemented together), reniform (kidney shapes) or botryoidal (globular, like bunches of grapes) accumulations. It is also a very common pseudomorph. It is frequently encountered in the swampy areas at the head of spring waters (&#x27;bog iron&#x27;), on cave floors, and on the bottom of lakes and small creeks. The &quot;boxworks&quot; or gossan resulting from the oxidation of sulfide ore deposits is formed of goethite along with other iron oxides and quartz.

Significant deposits of goethite are found in England; Cuba; and Minnesota, Missouri, Colorado, Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, and Tennessee, in the United States.

Deposits significant in location, if not in abundance, have been found in the Martian crater Gusev by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Spirit&quot; rover, providing strong evidence for the presence of liquid water on the planet in an earlier stage of its evolution.

Limpets&#x27; teeth are composed of about 80% goethite fibres of only tens of nanometers in diameter, small enough to be flaw-insensitive, which accounts for their extreme tensile strength of 3.5–6.0 GPa and elastic modulus of . 

== Usage ==
Its main modern use is as an iron ore, being referred to as &quot;brown iron ore&quot;. Goethite is an important component of ochre pigments, and has been heat-treated for use as a red pigment since Paleolithic times. Iron-rich lateritic soils that have developed over serpentinite rocks in tropical climates are mined for their iron content, as well as other metals.

Fine goethite specimens are rare and therefore are valued collectibles. Banded or iridescent varieties are cut and polished into cabochons for jewelry making.

In a royal tomb of the ancient kingdom of Phrygia, a body was found believed to be King Gordias, father of the legendary King Midas. The burial shroud had been colored with a dye containing goethite, which in its original unfaded state would have made the shroud look like it was woven from gold. Historians speculate that the legend of King Midas&#x27; golden touch might have originated from Phrygian royalty wearing clothes made from such golden-colored textiles.

<text>Colin Ward (14 August 1924 – 11 February 2010) was a British anarchist writer and editor. He has been called &quot;one of the greatest anarchist thinkers of the past half century, and a pioneering social historian.&quot;

==Life==

Ward was born in Wanstead, Essex, to Arnold and Ruby Ward (). Arnold was a teacher and Ruby a clerical worker. His parents were active Labour Party supporters. Ward attended Ilford County High School, leaving school aged 15. After leaving school he worked as an assistant to a builder, then for West Ham Council, before working as a draughtsman at Sidney Caulfield&#x27;s architectural practice.

In 1942, aged 18, Ward was conscripted into the army as a sapper, going on to work as a draughtsman in the Royal Engineers. Based in Glasgow during the war, Ward began attending Glasgow Anarchist Group events. As a soldier he subscribed to the anti-militarist anarchist newspaper &quot;War Commentary&quot;, and in 1945 Ward was called as a witness for the prosecution in the trial of the paper&#x27;s editors, John Hewetson, Vernon Richards and Philip Sansom. Shortly after the trial he was transferred to Orkney.

After being demobbed in 1946 he returned to working for Sidney Caulfield and began contributing to Freedom Press. In 1947 he began editing the anarchist newspaper &quot;Freedom –&quot; successor to &quot;War Commentary&quot;. He remained an editor of &quot;Freedom&quot; until 1960. He was the founder and editor of the monthly anarchist journal &quot;Anarchy&quot; from 1961 to 1970.

Until 1961, Ward worked as an architect&#x27;s assistant. In 1964 undertook teacher training at Garnett College where he met his future wife, Harriet Unwin, and he subsequently began teaching at Wandsworth Technical College.

In 1971, he became the Education Officer for the Town and Country Planning Association. He published widely on education, architecture and town planning. His most influential book was &quot;The Child in the City&quot; (1978), about children&#x27;s street culture. From 1995 to 1996, Ward was Centennial Professor of Housing and Social Policy at the London School of Economics. In 2001, Ward was made an Honorary Doctor of Philosophy at Anglia Ruskin University.

== Thought ==

=== Anarchism ===

Ward&#x27;s philosophy aimed at removing authoritarian forms of social organisation and replacing them with self-managed, non-hierarchical forms. This is based upon the principle that, as Ward put it, &quot;in small face-to-face groups, the bureaucratising and hierarchical tendencies inherent in organisations have least opportunity to develop&quot;.

Anarchism for Ward is &quot;a description of a mode of human organization, rooted in the experience of everyday life, which operates side by side with, and in spite of, the dominant authoritarian trends of our society&quot;. In contrast to many anarchist philosophers and practitioners, Ward holds that &quot;anarchism in all its guises is an assertion of human dignity and responsibility. It is not a programme for political change but an act of social self-determination&quot;.

=== Education ===
Colin Ward in his main theoretical publication &quot;Anarchy in Action&quot; (1973) in a chapter called &quot;Schools No Longer&quot; &quot;discusses the genealogy of education and schooling, in particular examining the writings of Everett Reimer and Ivan Illich, and the beliefs of anarchist educator Paul Goodman. Many of Colin’s writings in the 1970s, in particular &quot;Streetwork: The Exploding School&quot; (1973, with Anthony Fyson), focused on learning practices and spaces outside of the school building. In introducing &quot;Streetwork&quot;, Ward writes, &quot;[this] is a book about ideas: ideas of the environment as the educational resource, ideas of the enquiring school, the school without walls...”. In the same year, Ward contributed to &quot;Education Without Schools&quot; (edited by Peter Buckman) discussing &#x27;the role of the state&#x27;. He argued that &quot;one significant role of the state in the national education systems of the world is to perpetuate social and economic injustice&quot;&quot;.

In &quot;The Child in the City&quot; (1978), and later &quot;The Child in the Country&quot; (1988), Ward &quot;examined the everyday spaces of young people’s lives and how they can negotiate and re-articulate the various environments they inhabit. In his earlier text, the more famous of the two, Colin Ward explores the creativity and uniqueness of children and how they cultivate &#x27;the art of making the city work&#x27;. He argued that through play, appropriation and imagination, children can counter adult-based intentions and interpretations of the built environment. His later text, The Child in the Country, inspired a number of social scientists, notably geographer Chris Philo (1992), to call for more attention to be paid to young people as a &#x27;hidden&#x27; and marginalised group in society.&quot;

<doc id="90709" wikidata="Q7882807" url="?curid=90709" title="Uncle Scrooge Adventures">
<text>Uncle Scrooge Adventures is a 1987–1997 Disney comic book series published by Gladstone Publishing under license from the Walt Disney Company. It features the adventures of Scrooge McDuck and his nephews Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. It was usually distinguished from the main &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; title in its focus on longer, full-length stories, often in the pulp adventure style.

The first series ran for 21 issues from 1987 to 1990, when Gladstone Publishing&#x27;s license with the Walt Disney Company ceased. Disney Comics chose not to continue the series from 1990 through 1993. When Gladstone renewed their license in 1993, they resumed the series, picking up with issue 22. The series continued until 1997, when it fell victim to the &quot;Gladstone implosion&quot; and ceased publication following issue 54. The series was not subsequently revived by either Gemstone Publishing (who held the Disney comics license from 2003 through 2008) or Boom! Studios (who held it from 2009 through 2011).

The story &quot;Horsing Around with History&quot; in issue 33 of the second series won the Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1996.

==Original title==

The series was initially intended to launch in 1987 as a tie-in to the forthcoming &quot;DuckTales&quot; television series. The focus was to be on the works of Carl Barks and other Disney comics creators that inspired the series, not necessarily original works produced in response to the series. Shortly before publication of the first issue, however, Gladstone Publishing and the Walt Disney Company decided to drop the &quot;DuckTales&quot; name and re-brand the series &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot;, in the same format as its intended sister title, &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;. 

Because of the last minute of the nature of the change, however, promotional articles using the &quot;DuckTales&quot; title could not be altered, even in the first issue of &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; itself. Gladstone would eventually publish a thirteen issue &quot;DuckTales&quot; series of their own from 1988 through 1990, featuring a mixture of classic Uncle Scrooge stories and newly commissioned television tie-ins. 

==Censorship==
&quot;The Treasure Temple of Khaos&quot;, featured in issue 35, was censored in the United States due to several depictions of nudity (Uncle Scrooge used Huey and Dewey&#x27;s sweatshirts as torches in an Egyptian pyramid and soon uses his own coat as a torch), replacing it with undershirts, although the nakedness is uncensored in most other countries.

<text>Interstate 55 (I-55) is a major Interstate Highway in the central United States. As with most primary Interstates that end in a five, it is a major cross-country, north–south route, connecting the Gulf of Mexico to the Great Lakes. The highway travels from LaPlace, Louisiana, at I-10 to Chicago, Illinois, at U.S. Route 41 (US 41, Lake Shore Drive), at McCormick Place. The major cities that I-55 connects to are (from south to north) New Orleans, Louisiana; Jackson, Mississippi; Memphis, Tennessee; St. Louis, Missouri; and Chicago, Illinois.

The section of I-55 between Chicago and St. Louis was built as an alternate route for U.S. Route 66 (US 66). The Interstate crosses the Mississippi River twice: once at Memphis and again at St. Louis.

==History==

When it was realized that a national highway system was needed, the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 provided for a highway replacing the old US 66 which I-55 filled. I-55 was originally constructed in the 1960s, to extend a section of US 66 between I-294 and Gardner which had been converted into a freeway and had Interstate signage installed in 1960. During the rest of the 1960s, I-55 was built in portions throughout Illinois, eventually connecting St. Louis to Chicago, where it became the fourth direct route between them. As it goes southward, most of the Interstate was purpose-built during the 1960s and 1970s. The entire length was completed in 1979.

===Louisiana===

In Louisiana, I-55 runs nearly from south to north, from I-10 near Laplace ( west of New Orleans) to the Mississippi state line near Kentwood. Approximately a third of the distance consists of the Manchac Swamp Bridge, a nearly causeway, often cited as the third-longest viaduct in the world.

===Mississippi===

In Mississippi, I-55 runs from the Louisiana border near Osyka to Southaven on the Tennessee border, just south of Memphis, Tennessee. Noteworthy cities and towns that I-55 passes through or close by to are Brookhaven, McComb, Jackson, and Grenada. This highway parallels US 51 in its path roughly through the center of Mississippi. The from Hernando to the Tennessee state line coincide with the newer I-69.

The Mississippi section of I-55 is defined in the Mississippi Code § 65-3-3.

===Tennessee===

I-55 in Tennessee lies entirely within the city of Memphis, passing through the southern and western parts of the city and providing a bypass of downtown for motorists who do not want to take I-240 and I-40 through downtown to cross the Mississippi River. The western portion of this highway, which passes through an industrialized section of the city, contains numerous low-clearance bridges and also a very tight 270-degree cloverleaf turn northbound at Crump Boulevard. The Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT) currently has an interchange improvement project for this portion. Heavy truck traffic heading to and from Arkansas in this area is hence directed to detour via I-240 and I-40.

For the Tennessee stretch of the Interstate, the usual national freeway speed limit of is reduced to .

===Arkansas===

I-55 enters Arkansas from Tennessee as it crosses the Mississippi River on the Memphis &amp; Arkansas Bridge. It overlaps I-40 for approximately in West Memphis. After separating from I-40, I-55 turns northward and runs with US 61, US 63, and US 64 until US 64 exits in through Marion. I-55/US 61/US 63 continues north through Crittenden County through rural farms of the Arkansas delta, including an interchange with I-555/US 63 in Turrell. I-55 passes through Blytheville, where it has a junction with Highway 18 (AR 18) before entering Missouri. I-55 parallels US 61 in its path through Arkansas, which it continues to do after crossing into Missouri.

===Missouri===
In Missouri, I-55 runs from the southeastern part of the state, at the Arkansas border, to St. Louis. In the southern part of the state, I-55 meets I-57 in Sikeston. Then I-55 goes north to St. Louis, where I-44 merges in with I-55, and then I-64 (on the Poplar Street Bridge), when crossing the Mississippi River into Illinois.

Among the cities and towns served by I-55 in Missouri are Sikeston, Cape Girardeau, and St. Louis.

As noted above, I-55 parallels US 61 for most of its course through Missouri, from the Arkansas border to the southern portion of St. Louis County.

===Illinois===
Through Illinois, I-55 largely follows the 1940 alignment of the former US 66, now Historic US 66 (Illinois Route 66 Scenic Byway). It runs from the Poplar Street Bridge in East St. Louis to US 41 in Chicago, passing around the state capital of Springfield and the metro area of Bloomington–Normal.

Within Illinois, I-55 goes by several names. Near the I-270/I-70 split, it is referred to as the Paul Simon Freeway after former US Senator Paul Simon, who began his political career in this region. Further north, between the St. Louis area and Springfield, I-55 is named the Vince Demuzio Expressway for former Illinois State Senator Vince Demuzio. Finally, in the Chicago area between the I-80 interchange near Joliet and I-55&#x27;s eastern terminus at US 41 (Lake Shore Drive) in Chicago, the expressway is referred to as the Adlai E. Stevenson Expressway (previously called the Southwest Expressway) in honor of former Illinois governor Adlai E. Stevenson II, who was a two-time Democratic nominee for President of the United States and also the US Ambassador to the United Nations under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. In July 2018 the stretch of I-55 from I-294 to milemarker 202 near Pontiac was renamed as Barack Obama Presidential Expressway.

When the stretch of I-55 through Illinois was being planned during the 1960s, the state&#x27;s governor, Otto Kerner Jr., made an effort to have it routed close to the larger city of Peoria instead of the straighter route through the Bloomington–Normal area. This ultimately failed plan was ridiculed in the press as the so-called &quot;Kerner Curve&quot;. The need for a freeway connection between Springfield and Peoria was later filled by the spur route I-155. This also connects with nearby Lincoln and Morton and forms a triangle between the three population centers in Central Illinois.

<text>Interstate 57 (I-57) is a north–south Interstate Highway that currently exists in two segments. It runs through Arkansas, Missouri, and Illinois. I-57 parallels the old Illinois Central Railroad for much of its route north of I-55. The Interstate begins at I-40 in North Little Rock, Arkansas, traveling northward concurrently with U.S. Highway 67 (US 67) until it reaches Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, where the Interstate ends for now. I-57 will run northward to meet up with the existing segment in southeastern Missouri. I-57 resumes its run from Sikeston, Missouri, at I-55 to Chicago, Illinois, at I-94. I-57 essentially serves as a shortcut route for travelers headed between the Southern United States (Memphis, New Orleans, etc.) and Chicago, bypassing St. Louis, Missouri, and Springfield, Illinois. 

Between the junction of I-55 and I-57 in Sikeston and the junction of I-55 and I-90/I-94 in Chicago, I-55 travels for , while the combination of I-57 and I-94 is only long between the same two points. In fact, both the control cities on the overhead signs and the destination mileage signs reference Memphis along southbound I-57, even as far north as its northern origin at I-94 in Chicago. Likewise, at its southern end in Missouri, Chicago is the control city listed for I-57 on signs on northbound I-55 south of Sikeston, even though I-55 also goes to Chicago.

A southward extension of I-57 from Sikeston to Little Rock, Arkansas, is currently in various stages of development. On November 7, 2024, of US 67 from North Little Rock to Walnut Ridge in Arkansas was officially redesignated to I-57, finally extending the Interstate to the state of Arkansas.

===Arkansas===
In Arkansas, I-57 begins in North Little Rock at I-40, running concurrently with US 67 and US 167. I-440 westbound begins at the junction of the two Interstates in Jacksonville. I-57 continues northbound through Jacksonville, and the Interstate temporarily narrows from six lanes to four lanes at the Main Street interchange. I-57 is four lanes until it widens back to six lanes just north of the Vandenberg Boulevard interchange (exit 11). I-57 widens back to six lanes for northbound until an interchange with Highway 5 (AR 5) and AR 89 in Cabot. At this point, the Interstate reverts to four lanes as it continues north through Cabot. After the AR 5/AR 89 interchange in Cabot, I-57 reverts to four lanes until it ends in Walnut Ridge. In Beebe, US 64 runs concurrently with the Interstate and continues east for until exit 55 in Bald Knob where US 64 splits off to the east and US 167 splits off to the north to Batesville. I-57 continues northbound from Bald Knob, through Newport to Walnut Ridge, where it runs concurrently with US 412. The Interstate ends at unsigned exit 124 in Walnut Ridge, where US 67 continues north to Pocahontas and US 412 splits off to the east.

===Missouri===

In Missouri, I-57 begins in Sikeston at a cloverleaf interchange with I-55 as a continuation of US 60 and heads east. Entering Charleston, the Interstate almost immediately interchanges with I-57 Bus./Route 105. Southeast of the city, it then turns to the northeast. To the east of Charleston, the US 60 concurrency ends after about when I-57 meets US 62/Route 77, with US 60 heading eastward and I-57 Bus. ending. I-57 eventually meets the Missouri–Illinois state line at the Mississippi River, crossing the Cairo I-57 Bridge into Cairo, Illinois.

===Illinois===
I-57 is the longest Interstate Highway in the state of Illinois, spanning long with Chicago being the main city along its northern route and Memphis being the southern main city along its southern route. I-57 then enters Illinois across the Mississippi River into Cairo. It passes through Mounds and Ullin, and then it makes an interchange with US 51, making US 51 depart from its temporary concurrency with the Interstate. I-57 then continues north and has an interchange with I-24 toward Nashville, Tennessee. It then continues to head toward Marion, West Frankfort, Benton, Whittington, and Ina and then heads into Mount Vernon. In Mount Vernon, I-57 has a short concurrency with I-64 while making two diamond interchanges with the city&#x27;s streets. I-64 then leaves I-57 and continues its western route toward St. Louis, Missouri, while I-57 continues toward Effingham. In Effingham, I-70 joins I-57 and makes interchanges with the city&#x27;s streets once again. I-70 then departs from I-57 and continues east toward Terre Haute and Indianapolis, Indiana. As for I-57, it continues and heads toward Mattoon where it has a cloverleaf interchange with US 45 and then heads toward Champaign where it meets the terminus of I-72 in a cloverleaf interchange. It then travels for another and then meets up with a soon to be changed from a cloverleaf interchange to a semi-directional interchange with I-74 going east toward Indianapolis (again) and west toward Bloomington. The Interstate then heads toward Kankakee and then into Cook County where it meets its own terminus with I-94 ending in Chicago.

==History==

The oldest segment of I-57 is a strip running east of Bradley to Kankakee labeled on the 1959 Illinois state highway map. Two years later, a stretch of I-57 from Dongola north to Marion opened on September 26, 1961. Another portion between the Illinois Route 121 (IL 121)/US 45 exit and the Watson–Mason exit was completed and opened prior to July 1965, linking I-57 to I-70 and running in tandem with I-70 for several miles, with access to Indianapolis, Indiana, to the east and St. Louis, Missouri, to the west. A section of I-57 in Jefferson County from Bonnie (using a temporary road that is still partially visible from the northbound lanes) to IL 161 later opened on December 9, 1969. The portion of I-57 in Chicago (known as the Dan Ryan West Leg Extension) was constructed and opened in segments between 1963 and 1970. It remains the most recent Interstate Highway to be established within the city. The final section of I-57 in Illinois opened in December 1971 at Paxton.

The portion of I-43 from Milwaukee to Green Bay was originally numbered as I-57. The number was changed due to the existence of I-57 in Illinois.

I-57 was widened to six lanes in Effingham from 2011 until 2016.

For many years, an interchange at the junction of I-57 with I-294 did not exist. It was one of the few places in the U.S. where Interstates cross but have no interchange. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) and Illinois State Toll Highway Authority (ISTHA) opened Phase 1 of a new interchange in 2014, providing access from I-57 north to I-294 north and from I-294 south to I-57 south. Phase 2, which four of the remaining movements (northbound-to-southbound access being served by I-80), was opened to traffic on September 11, 2022.

==Future==

I-57 is slated to eventually be extended west along US 60 to Poplar Bluff, Missouri, and then south along the US 67 corridor to North Little Rock, Arkansas, ending at I-40. The extension is listed under High Priority Corridor 89, the I-57 Corridor Extension. In April 2016, a provision designating US 67 from North Little Rock to Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, as &quot;Future I-57&quot; was added into the federal fiscal year 2017 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development funding bill and officially became law in 2017. On November 7, 2024, the section of US 67 between North Little Rock and Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, was officially designated as I-57 by ArDOT.

Missouri has already converted of the US 60/US 67 corridor between Sikeston and US 160/Route 158 near Harviell to a mixture of freeway and expressway segments. All at-grade crossings along the corridor would have to be eliminated before the Interstate designation could be applied. This leaves about of new freeway between US 160/Route 158 to the Arkansas state line to be constructed.

In Arkansas, of Interstate-grade US 67 runs from I-40 to US 412 in Walnut Ridge, leaving a segment of approximately of new Interstate-grade highway along US 67 that still would need to be built in northeastern Arkansas. The Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT) announced in September 2023 that work to extend Future I-57 in Clay County would begin in late 2024 or early 2025 depending on when contracts are let along with completion of the final design process. The first section will be between the US 67 interchanges at Walnut Ridge and Corning while the second section (which will begin construction starting in 2025) will extend the first section northward to the Missouri state line. Plans for the Corning Bypass show Arkansas Highway 657 (AR 657) as a temporary designation for this section until other sections are completed. ARDOT announced on November 6, 2024, that ground would be broken on the Corning Bypass on November 14, 2024.

==Exit list==













































==Charleston business loop==

Interstate 57 Business (I-57 Bus.) in Charleston, Missouri, begins at I-57 exit 10. From this diamond interchange, it runs north concurrently with Route 105 along South Main Street into the city center. It then turns east onto Marshall Street, which also carries US 62 and Route 77. The business route ends at I-57 exit 12. US 62 and Route 77 continue to the east with US 60.

<text>Interstate 79 (I-79) is an Interstate Highway in the Eastern United States, designated from I-77 in Charleston, West Virginia, north to Pennsylvania Route 5 (PA 5) and PA 290 in Erie, Pennsylvania. It is a primary thoroughfare through western Pennsylvania and West Virginia and makes up part of an important corridor to Buffalo, New York, and the Canada–United States border. Major metropolitan areas connected by I-79 include Charleston and Morgantown in West Virginia and Greater Pittsburgh and Erie in Pennsylvania.

In West Virginia, I-79 is known as the Jennings Randolph Expressway, named for the West Virginia representative and senator. In the three most northern counties, it is signed as part of the High Tech Corridor. For most of its Pennsylvania stretch, it is known as the Raymond P. Shafer Highway, named for the 39th Pennsylvania governor.

==Route description==

Except at its northern end, I-79 is located on the Allegheny Plateau. Despite the somewhat rugged terrain, the road is relatively flat. Most of the highway is at an elevation of about above sea level, with some lower areas near both ends and higher areas near Sutton, West Virginia. In the hillier areas, this flatness is achieved by curving around hills, along ridges, and in or partway up river valleys. From Sutton north, I-79 generally parallels the path of U.S. Route 19 (US 19).

===West Virginia===
I-79 begins at a modified full Y interchange with I-77 along the northwest bank of the Elk River just northeast of Charleston. (Instead of the expected treatment of I-77 as the primary route at this interchange, the following traffic movements are found: northbound I-77 through traffic curves to the left, while traffic to northbound I-79 exits right; southbound I-77 through traffic curves to the right and merges on the right with traffic from southbound I-79, while traffic to northbound I-79 both exits and merges on the left; southbound I-79 traffic merges on the left with traffic from southbound I-77, while traffic to northbound I-77 both exits and merges on the left.) For its first to a point just south of Flatwoods, I-79 is located in the watershed of the Elk River, which drains into the Kanawha River. It crosses the Elk River at Frametown and again at Sutton and never strays more than about from it.

===Pennsylvania===

I-79 enters Pennsylvania from Morgantown, West Virginia. South of Washington, it traverses mostly rural Greene County.

Between milemarkers 34 and 38, I-79 overlaps I-70 in the Washington area before heading north toward Pittsburgh.

I-79 is carried over the Ohio River by the Neville Island Bridge, approximately northwest of Pittsburgh.

The freeway into Pittsburgh requires drivers to use I-376 while I-79 completely bypasses the city. Beyond the Pittsburgh area, I-79 traverses more rural areas in Butler, Lawrence, Mercer, Crawford, and Erie counties before arriving at its termination point in Erie. In Erie, I-90 connects from I-79 to Buffalo, New York, and the Canadian border.

Around milemarker 100 on the northbound side are two ghost ramps that were specifically built for the Boy Scouts of America in order to have access to Moraine State Park without having to travel on US 422 for the 1973 and 1977 National Scout Jamborees, which were held at Moraine. The ramps were permanently closed after the 1977 event but remain visible under encroaching vegetation.

==History==

The Pennsylvania General Assembly authorized the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission to build two extensions in the 1950s. The Northwestern Extension, authorized in 1953, was to stretch from the main Pennsylvania Turnpike north to Erie and would have included a lateral connection between Ohio and New York, what was later built as I-90. The Southwestern Extension, authorized in 1955, was to run south from the main line near Pittsburgh to West Virginia, where it connects with an extension of the West Virginia Turnpike. Except for the section between Washington and Greater Pittsburgh, which was included as part of I-70, the first portion of I-79 to be added to the plans was north from Pittsburgh to Erie, along the US 19 corridor.

In September 1955, two short urban portions were designated:
* I-179: A spur from I-90 north to Erie, currently absorbed into I-79.
* I-279: A western bypass of Pittsburgh, connecting I-70 with I-80S (now I-76); it and I-79 later swapped designations.

The number 79 was assigned in 1958, and an extension south along I-70 to Washington and beyond to Charleston was approved on October 18, 1961. This extension also paralleled US 19 to near Sutton, where it turned westerly to reach Charleston. (The part of US 19 from Sutton south to I-77 at Beckley, West Virginia, has since been four-laned as Corridor L of the Appalachian Development Highway System.)

On December 21, 1967, the first section of I-79 in West Virginia, between exits 125 (Saltwell Road) and 132 (South Fairmont), opened to traffic. This section bypassed part of West Virginia Route 73 (WV 73) between Bridgeport and Fairmont. Another opened in July 1968, extending the highway on a bypass of downtown Fairmont to exit 137 (East Park Avenue). It was further extended toward Morgantown on October 15, 1970, bypassing more of WV 73 to exit 146 (Goshen Road) south of that city.

On June 29, 1970, the swap of I-79 and I-279 was approved. At the same time, I-76 was extended west from Downtown Pittsburgh over former I-79 to the new location of I-79 west of Pittsburgh, so I-279 only ran north from Downtown Pittsburgh. On December 3, 1971, I-76 was rerouted to bypass Pittsburgh, and I-279 was extended to I-79 utilizing the former section of I-76. The changes took effect on October 2, 1972.

On June 29, 1973, I-79 was extended from West Virginia exit 146 to exit 148 (I-68), where, at one point, traffic was forced onto the newly opened west end of Corridor E (now I-68) to exit 1. A further extension of , including the Uffington Bridge over the Monongahela River southwest of Morgantown, was opened on August 30, 1973, leading north to exit 155 (Star City). This completed I-79 from north of Bridgeport to north of Morgantown.

To the south of Bridgeport, the first two sections were both opened on December 22, 1971. One of these ran from exit 51 (Frametown) to exit 62 (Sutton), and the other from exit 105 (Jane Lew) to exit 115 (Nutter Fort). On September 19, 1973, another stretch was opened, from exit 105 (Jane Lew) south to exit 99 (Weston).

In 1973, significant portions of the Interstate were completed. I-79 opened from exit 62 to exit 99. Another , from exit 67 (Flatwoods) north to exit 91 (Roanoke), opened on November 28, 1973, along with the section from exit 115 north to exit 117 (Anmoore), completing the route between Frametown and Morgantown except in the Bridgeport area.

A extension from exit 51 south to exit 46 (Servia) opened on February 1, 1974, and County Route 11 to WV 4 near Duck was widened to handle the increased load. On the same day, two lanes opened from exit 155 (Osage) north to the state line.

On October 16, 1974, two pieces of I-79 were opened: the other two lanes of the from exit 155 to the state line and between exits 117 (Anmoore) and 125 (north of Bridgeport). On the same day, the eastern end of Corridor D and the western end of Corridor E, both connecting to I-79 (at exits 119 and 148), were opened. This completed I-79 in West Virginia north of exit 46 (Servia); it was extended south to exit 25 (Amma) in late November and to US 119 north of Clendenin (exit 19) on November 13, 1975. It was opened from exit 19 to exit 9 (Elkview) on November 18, 1977, and finally completed to I-77 in 1979.

On July 25, 1975, I-79 was opened between exits 1 and 14 in Pennsylvania. The last piece of I-79 between West Virginia and Erie—the Neville Island Bridge over the Ohio River—opened on September 3, 1976. In 1984, the route was extended about further to the north, with the opening of a new segment between US 20 and PA 5 in Erie. 

I-79 was completely rebuilt from the West Virginia state line to Erie from 1991 to 1993. Pavement was rebuilt bridge decks replaced, and rest area rebuilt.

Milepost based exit numbers were introduced to the Pennsylvania portion in 2001.

In 2000, construction began on the interchange with the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Cranberry. It was opened to traffic in 2004.

In late 2008, the missing ramps of the I-79/I-376 interchange (PA 60 was designated as the route for southbound traffic seeking to go to Pittsburgh International Airport and for airport traffic seeking to go northbound on I-79) were completed.

In June 2009, I-376 was extended west and north of Downtown Pittsburgh, and I-279 was truncated back to the section only running from Downtown Pittsburgh north to I-79.

During 2010, PennDOT undertook a $20.8 million improvement of I-79, Neville Island Bridge as well as other intersections.

On December 22, 2010, WVDOT competed construction on a new interchange to serve Route 173.

In 2010, construction began on improvements to exit 88. This was competed in December 2012.

Construction began in 2011 on improvements to the interchange with Interstate 70 in South Strabane. They were competed in Summer 2013.

In 2020, a new safety system went into effect to better warn motorists about the sharp curvature between the PA 60 interchange and PA 51 interchange.

Construction of the PA 576 interchange was completed on June 24, 2022. This involved construction of a new underpass.

In 2025, WVDOT expects to compete a six-lane widening between Harrison County and the Pennsylvania state line.

<doc id="90723" wikidata="Q3246988" url="?curid=90723" title="Albani Brewery">
<text>Albani Bryggerierne A/S (Eng.: &quot;Albani Breweries&quot;) is a brewery located in Odense, Denmark, and the vast majority of its customers live on the island of Funen. The brewery was founded by MPharm Theodor Schiøtz in 1859. In 2000, the brewery merged with &quot;Bryggerigruppen&quot; with the Brewery group (now known as Royal Unibrew), a group of Danish regional breweries.

Albani is most known for two of its beers, Odense Pilsner and Odense Classic.

==Beers==

===Odense Pilsner===
Odense Pilsner is a pilsener. The taste is balanced between malt and fruit. Two different varieties of hops are used, both come from Hallertau in Germany. It has been brewed since 1934 and was originally not part of the Albani Brewery&#x27;s portfolio, but was introduced to the product line with the acquisition of &quot;Bryggeriet Odense&quot;.

Alcohol by volume: 4.6%

===Odense Classic===

Odense Classic is a pilsener, though it has a more dark colour than ordinary beers of the same type. The beer has a more rounded, but still powerful taste of malt and hops. It was introduced at the brewery&#x27;s 140th anniversary in 1999.

Alcohol by volume: 4.6%

===Odense Rød Classic===
Odense Rød Classic (Danish for &quot;Odense Red Classic&quot;) is a Vienna lager. A mixture of dark caramel malt and Münchener malt is used. The result is a dark beer with a somewhat rounded taste. The colour is dark golden red, which might be the source of the name.

Alcohol by volume: 4.6%

===Giraf Beer===
Giraf Beer is a strong pilsener. It was first brewed in 1962, when Odense Zoo&#x27;s giraffe (Danish: &quot;giraf&quot;) Kalle was found dead, as the Albani Breweries had previously used this giraffe in its advertisement, it decided to create a special beer, the profits of which would be spent on purchasing a new giraffe for the zoo. The first year&#x27;s production raised enough funds to buy two giraffes for the zoo.

Red: Alcohol by volume: 7.3%&lt;br&gt;
Black: Alcohol by volume: 10.0%

===HC Andersen===
HC Andersen is a strong ale-type beer, first brewed in 1988 when the Albani Breweries decided to create a special beer to celebrate Odense&#x27;s 1,000th anniversary.
The beer became so popular that Albani decided to keep it as a part of its product range. In 1989, it was marketed under its current name, honouring Hans Christian Andersen. A small batch of HC Andersen is brewed every year, and released on Andersen&#x27;s birthday, April 2. Each year&#x27;s labels depict a different paper cutting by Hans Christian Andersen. The bottles are also serial numbered. As a result, the beer has become a collector&#x27;s item. 
The beer is bottom fermented and is matured longer than ordinary beer. The result is a beer with a light taste, considering its high alcohol content.

Alcohol by volume: 9%

===Christmas Beers===
Albani produces two Christmas beers Blålys (Danish for &quot;Blue light&quot;) and Rødhætte (Danish for &quot;Red Riding Hood&quot;). Blålys was introduced in 1960, although it was not Denmark&#x27;s first Christmas beer, &quot;Blålys&quot; effectively started the tradition of Danish Christmas beers. Denmark&#x27;s first Christmas beer was produced by the &quot;Carlsminde&quot; brewery and had been introduced the previous year. Albani acquired Carlsminde in 1972. Both &quot;Blålys&quot; and &quot;Rødhætte&quot; are dark lagers. The label depicts the church-like &quot;Gallery Tower&quot; of the brewery cover covered in snow. This is the reason why many people originally referred to the Christmas beer as the &quot;church beer&quot; . This only lasted a few years until other breweries introduced their own Christmas beers.

Blålys: Alcohol by volume: 7%

Rødhætte: Alcohol by volume: 5.6%

===Easter beer===
Påskebryg (Danish for Easter Brew), is a strong pilsener, and the Albani Breweries&#x27; traditional beer for the Easter season. Easter beers were Denmark&#x27;s first seasonal beers in Denmark, and were introduced by Carlsberg in 1905. The Påskebryg was introduced in the 1950s and is brewed from a mixture of dark and light malt.

Alcohol by volume: 5,6%

===Light beers===
Albani also produces two light beers, Odense Light and Odense Extra Light, as light alternatives to its original pilsener. These beers are brewed using light pilsener malt, Münchner malt, and caramel malt.

Odense Light: Alcohol by volume: 2.6%

Odense Extra Light: Alcohol by volume: 0.05%

==Mergers and acquisitions==
At the turn of the twentieth century there was a large consolidation in the Danish brewing industry, where the larger city breweries typically bought the smaller countryside breweries. Albani was part of this development, buying smaller breweries in Odense and around the island of Funen. Later, when Albani had a near monopoly on beer distribution on Funen, Albani started acquiring breweries in other parts of the country; Sønderborg Bryghus, Bryggeriet Slotsmøllen, Baldur, and Maribo Bryghus, in each case, Albani taking control of the other company. Albani Breweries A/S merged with the Royal Unibrew group in 2000.

Other names used by the group are:

==Hans Christian Andersen==
Denmark&#x27;s best known poet and author, Hans Christian Andersen, was very fond of Albani beers. In a letter to a friend he described Albani beer as: &quot;Jeg kan ikke rose denne øl højt nok. Den er forfriskende, delikat og stærk. Prøv den!&quot; (Danish for &quot;I cannot recommend this beer enough. It is refreshing, savoury and strong. Try it!&quot;) This quote is occasionally used in the company&#x27;s marketing.

<doc id="90726" wikidata="Q6945291" url="?curid=90726" title="My Disillusionment in Russia">
<text>My Disillusionment in Russia is a book by Emma Goldman, published in 1923 by Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. The book was based on a much longer manuscript entitled &quot;My Two Years in Russia&quot;, which was an eyewitness account of events in Russia from 1920 to 1921 that ensued in the wake of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and which culminated in the Kronstadt rebellion. Long concerned about developments with the Bolsheviks, Goldman described the rebellion as the &quot;final wrench. I saw before me the Bolshevik State, formidable, crushing every constructive revolutionary effort, suppressing, debasing, and disintegrating everything.&quot;

Much to Goldman&#x27;s dismay, only upon receiving the first printed copies of the book she became aware that (1) the publisher had changed the title; and (2) the last twelve chapters were entirely missing, including an afterword, which Goldman felt was &quot;the most vital part&quot; of the book. Sympathetic to the February Revolution, the complete book is an impassioned left critique of the subsequent Bolshevik Revolution, as well as Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy—an &quot;all-powerful, centralized Government with State Capitalism as its economic expression&quot;. The complete book is also critical of Marxian theory, which Goldman describes as &quot;a cold, mechanistic, enslaving formula&quot;.

After much back and forth with the publishers, the missing portions of Goldman&#x27;s original manuscript were published in a second American volume &quot;My Further Disillusionment in Russia&quot; (also titled by the publisher) in 1924. In the preface to the second volume of the American edition, Goldman wryly observes that only two of the reviewers sensed the incompleteness of the original American version, one of whom was not a regular critic but a librarian. A complete version of the full manuscript was published in England with an introduction by Rebecca West, also under the title &quot;My Disillusionment in Russia&quot; (London: C. W. Daniel Company, 1925).

<doc id="90727" wikidata="Q1265740" url="?curid=90727" title="Synod of Whitby">
<text>The Synod of Whitby was a Christian administrative gathering held in Northumbria in 664, wherein King Oswiu ruled that his kingdom would calculate Easter and observe the monastic tonsure according to the customs of Rome rather than the customs practised by Irish monks at Iona and its satellite institutions. The synod was summoned at Hilda&#x27;s double monastery of Streonshalh (Streanæshalch), later called Whitby Abbey.

==Sources==

There are two principal sources for the synod. The first source, the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot;, is a hagiographic work written by Stephen of Ripon, often identified as Eddius Stephanus, probably soon after 710. The second source is the &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; by the Venerable Bede, written in 731. One of Bede&#x27;s sources was the &quot;Life of Wilfrid&quot; itself, but he also had access to people who knew participants in the synod. For example, Bede knew Acca of Hexham, and dedicated many of his theological works to him. Acca was a companion of Wilfrid&#x27;s on some of his journeys to Rome.

Both accounts basically agree, though Bede gives a much lengthier discourse on the debate. The description of the proceedings, where King Oswiu presides and rules but does not engage in the ecclesiastics&#x27; debate himself, parallels examples of other synods in other sources, such as one in the &quot;Vita Sancti Bonifati&quot; by Willibald (where King Ine of Wessex performed the same function as Oswiu). Nonetheless, it is important to observe that the authors, despite their relatively good access to sources concerning the synod, still wrote at a distance, and the accounts, especially the quotations attributed to the participants, are more likely to be summaries of how Bede and Stephen understood the issue rather than something like true quotations. Further, the motivations of the authors influenced how they presented the material. Bede placed his description of the event centrally in his narrative, and he has been recognised as overemphasising the historical significance of the synod because Easter calculation was of special interest to him, and also because he wished to stress the unity of the English Church. However, Bede&#x27;s accuracy as a historian has been well regarded by Anglo-Saxon scholars, and historians have generally been comfortable following Bede&#x27;s basic presentation of the synod. Stephen&#x27;s text has found more criticism, and Reginald Poole identified many of his inaccuracies, but Stephen&#x27;s account of the synod did not suffer the same criticism as other passages in his work.

==Background==

In seventh-century Britain there were several differences between Roman and Celtic Christianity. One of these was the method of calculating the date of Easter. The Celtic practice was that of the Gaelic monks associated with the isle of Iona and its extensive network of daughter-houses, where the monks still observed an 84-year Easter cycle (as had earlier been the rule in Gaul and in Rome), whereas the newer tradition which was kept in Rome by this time was a 19-year cycle which had been adopted from the church of Alexandria. In the kingdom of Northumbria, these two traditions coexisted, and each had been encouraged by different royal houses. Edwin of Northumbria had converted to Christianity under the influence of missionaries sent from Rome by Pope Gregory the Great and thus had established the 19-year Easter cycle in his realm. However, following his death and a year of political instability, Oswald of Northumbria gained the throne. He had learned Christian practice from the monks of Iona during his stay there (while a political exile in his youth), and had encouraged Ionan missionaries to further the Christianization of Northumbria, especially the famous Bishop Aidan.

The Synod of Whitby was convened to settle a controversy about the correct method of calculating the date of Easter. Early Christians had probably originally celebrated Easter concurrent with the Jewish Passover (see Passover, Christian holiday), which was held on the fourteenth day of the first lunar month of the Jewish year, called &quot;Nisan&quot;, the day of the crucifixion according to John 19:14. However, the First Council of Nicaea in 325 decreed that Christians should no longer use the Jewish calendar but should universally celebrate Easter on a Sunday, the day of the resurrection, as had come to be the custom in Rome and Alexandria. Calculating the proper date (&quot;computus&quot;) was a complex process (involving a lunisolar calendar), and different calculation tables developed which resulted in different dates for the celebration of Easter.

In the 660s, Ionan adherents chose to continue using the 84-year Latercus cycle invented by Sulpicius Severus c. 410. Meanwhile, the Papal Curia had commissioned Victorius of Aquitaine (AD 457) and later Dionysius Exiguus (525) to produce a new reckoning, in order to resolve the differences between the Roman method and the more scientific method of the Alexandrian Church. The three reckonings often resulted in different dates for the celebration of Easter. Neither the Victorian or Dionysian reckonings were without problems. Dionysius had simply translated the Alexandrian system into Latin without understanding it. The Victorian system, confusingly, produced double dates, relying on the pope to choose which date to use. Nevertheless, the Victorian table was accepted widely outside the area of Irish influence. Around 602, the Irish missionary St Columbanus had already been condemned by a synod of French clerics for ignoring their authority and following his homeland&#x27;s Easter calculations (the Victorian table was declared official in Gaul in 541). About AD 600 Columbanus wrote to Pope Gregory I: &quot;You should know that Victorius has not been accepted by our teachers and by the old Irish experts and by the mathematicians most skilled in the calculation of the computus, but was considered more worthy of ridicule and pity than of authority.&quot; But in Ireland also, debate raged over the best option for calculating the date of Easter.

The proper date of the celebration of the most significant Christian feast had already resulted in visible disunity in the Northumbrian court: Queen Eanfled of Bernicia and her court observed Easter on a different day than did King Oswiu. While one royal faction was celebrating Easter, the other would still be fasting during Lent. Nonetheless, the disunity did not result in problems as long as the well-respected Aidan was alive. After his death, his successor Finan found himself challenged by a monk named Ronan, an Irishman who had been trained in Rome and who wished to see the Roman Easter established. It was only in the time of Colmán, the third Ionan monk elected Bishop of Northumbria, that the conflict required royal attention and resolution.

==Convocation==
An important figure in the convocation of the synod was Alchfrith, Oswiu&#x27;s son and sub-king in Deira. Henry Mayr-Harting considered him the &quot;chief cause of trouble which led to the Synod&quot;. In the early 660s, he expelled Ionan monks from the monastery of Ripon and gave it to Wilfrid, a Northumbrian churchman who had recently returned from Rome. Alchfrith&#x27;s position in the royal house, together with his promotion of Wilfrid (who would be the spokesperson for the Roman position at the synod), has contributed to the view that he was instrumental in arranging his father&#x27;s convocation of the synod.

The synod was held at a place called &quot;Streanæshalch&quot;, at a monastery of Hilda, herself a powerful Northumbrian noble and adherent to the Ionan Easter. The identification of the location with the place later called Whitby is generally accepted, but not absolutely certain. Another possible candidate is Strensall near York.

The Ionan position was advocated by Colmán, Bishop of Northumbria. In support of the Roman position, Eanfled had sent her chaplain Romanus, and the position was also taken by Agilbert, a Frankish bishop who also held office in England. Because of Agilbert&#x27;s inability to express the complicated arguments in Old English, which was for him a foreign language, Wilfrid was selected as the prime advocate for the Roman party. King Oswiu presided over the synod and acted as the final judge, who would give his royal authority in support of one side or the other.

==Decision==
Bishop Colmán defended the Ionan calculation of Easter on the grounds that it was the practice of Columba, founder of their monastic network and a saint of unquestionable holiness, who himself had followed the tradition of St. John the apostle and evangelist.

Wilfrid defended the Roman position on the following grounds (according to Bede&#x27;s narrative):
# It was the practice in Rome, where the apostles Saints Peter and Paul had &quot;lived, taught, suffered, and are buried&quot;.
# It was the universal practice of the Church, even as far as Egypt.
# The customs of the apostle John were particular to the needs of his community and his age and, since then, the Council of Nicaea had established a different practice.
# Columba had done the best he could considering his knowledge, and thus his irregular practice is excusable, but the Ionan monks at present did not have the excuse of ignorance.
# Whatever the case, no one has authority over Peter (and thus his successors, the bishops of Rome).

Oswiu then asked both sides if they agreed that Peter had been given the keys to the kingdom of heaven by Christ and pronounced to be &quot;the rock&quot; on which the Church would be built (as stated in Matthew 16:18–19), to which they agreed. Oswiu then declared his judgment in favour of the holder of the keys, i.e. the Roman (and Petrine) practice.

However, Wilfrid&#x27;s method of calculating the date of Easter was the one used in Alexandria, not in Rome. Bede presented the synod as a victory for the Roman party even though he had doubts whether the method was used in Rome. He produced his own version based on the Alexandrian tables, as amended by Dionysius, for his own calculations in his &quot;De Temporibus&quot; (703) and in more detail in his &quot;De Temporum Ratione&quot; (716–25). The Bedan tables came to be accepted in the British Isles and the Carolingian Empire in the ninth century and in Rome in the tenth.

==Outcome==
The Synod of Whitby established the supposed Roman practice as the norm in Northumbria, and thus &quot;brought the Northumbrian church into the mainstream of Roman culture.&quot; The episcopal seat of Northumbria was transferred from Lindisfarne to York. Wilfrid, chief advocate for the Roman position, later became Bishop of Northumbria, while Colmán and the Ionan supporters who did not change their practices withdrew to Iona. Colmán was allowed to take some relics of Aidan, who had been central in establishing Christianity of the Ionan tradition in Northumbria, with him back to Iona. To replace the departing ecclesiastics, Oswiu chose mostly Irishmen who were from the parts of Ireland that kept the Roman Easter (as most of Ireland had done for some time by the 660s).

==Legacy and historical significance==
The Synod of Whitby was just one of many councils held concerning the proper calculation of Easter throughout Latin Christendom in the Early Middle Ages. It addressed the issues of Easter calculation and of the proper monastic tonsure, and concerned only the part of the English Church that answered to the See of Lindisfarne: that is, it was a Northumbrian affair. Wilfrid&#x27;s advocacy of the Roman Easter has been called &quot;a triumphant push against an open door&quot;, since most of the Irish had already accepted the Roman Easter and for that reason Iona &quot;was already in danger of being pushed to one side by its Irish rivals.&quot;

Although the focus on Whitby is on the decisions on tonsure and dating of Easter, the synod was an important step in the eventual Romanisation of the church in England; even though this Romanisation might have occurred anyway without the Synod of Whitby. Nonetheless, since the Protestant Reformation, the events of the synod have been symbolically interpreted as a &quot;Celtic Church&quot; opposing a &quot;Roman Church&quot;, and the decision of Oswiu was thus interpreted as the &quot;subjugation&quot; of the &quot;British Church&quot; to Rome. There is a debate regarding the reality of a distinction between a pre-Whitby &quot;Celtic&quot; Church and a post-Whitby &quot;Roman&quot; Church. (Until fairly recently, the Scottish Divinity Faculty course on Church History ran from the Acts of the Apostles to 664 before resuming in 1560.) In the words of Patrick Wormald:
From the days of George Buchanan, supplying the initial propaganda for the makers of the Scottish Kirk, until a startlingly recent date, there was warrant for an anti-Roman, anti-episcopal and, in the nineteenth century, anti-establishment stance in the Columban or &quot;Celtic&quot; Church. ... The idea that there a &quot;Celtic Church&quot; in something of a post-Reformation sense is still maddeningly ineradicable from the minds of students.

In placing the synod in its proper historical context, historians of Anglo-Saxon England have also noted the position of the synod in the context of contemporary political tensions. Henry Mayr-Harting considered Alchfrith&#x27;s interest in the convocation of the synod to be derived from his desire to see his father&#x27;s position in Bernicia challenged and to see the replacement of Colmán with another bishop who would be more aligned with himself.

<doc id="90729" wikidata="Q9301566" url="?curid=90729" title="Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)">
<text>In Latter Day Saints theology, the term spirit world refers to the realm where the spirits of the dead await the resurrection. In LDS thought, this spirit world is divided into at least two conditions: Paradise and spirit prison:

Paradise includes &quot;the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality.&quot;

Spirit prison is the condition of the spirits of &quot;the wicked ... the ungodly and the unrepentant who had defiled themselves while in the flesh ... the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the warnings of the ancient prophets&quot;. The latter will continue to receive gospel teaching and be given the opportunity to repent, though their disposition toward repentance will only change as they recognize and accept gospel truths and believe in Jesus Christ.

==Paradise==
The spirit world is believed to be a place of continued spiritual growth for all spirits who embrace the teachings of Christ. Christ organized this teaching process during the time between his death on the cross and his resurrection, among those who had been faithful to the gospel, so that they could teach those who had not yet heard its message.

Brigham Young stated,

Where is the spirit world? It is right here...Do [spirits of the departed] go beyond the boundaries of the organized earth? No, they do not...Can you see it with your natural eyes? No. Can you see spirits in this room? No. Suppose the Lord should touch your eyes that you might see, could you then see the spirits? Yes, as plainly as you now see bodies.
Joseph Smith taught:

The spirits of the just ... are not far from us, and know and understand our thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and are often pained therewith.
==Spirit prison==

Spirit prison is believed by the Latter-day Saints to be both a place and the state of the soul between death and the resurrection, for people who have either not yet received knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ, or those who have been taught but have rejected it. It is a temporary state within the spirit world. Those who rejected the gospel after it was preached to them may suffer in a condition known as hell. The suffering associated with the spirit prison refers to anguish of the soul because of acute knowledge of one&#x27;s own sins and unclean state.

Latter-day Saints believe that spirit prison (a name based on the phrase &quot;the spirits in prison&quot; in the KJV translation of 1 Peter 3:19) is a place in the post-mortal spirit world for those who have &quot;died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets&quot;. This is a temporary state in which spirits will be taught the gospel and have the opportunity to repent and accept ordinances of salvation that are performed for them in temples. Those who accept the gospel may dwell in paradise until the resurrection. Those who choose not to repent but who are not sons of perdition will remain in spirit prison until the end of the Millennium, when they will be freed from hell and punishment and be resurrected to a telestial glory.

==Outer darkness==

In the teachings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), &quot;outer darkness&quot; has two separate meanings.

===Temporary abode of the wicked===
First, LDS Church scripture uses the term &quot;outer darkness&quot; to refer to a condition in the spirit world. The Book of Mormon teaches that after death, the spirits of those who &quot;chose evil works rather than good&quot; in mortality will be &quot;cast out into outer darkness&quot;. This is considered to be a condition of great torment, where there will be &quot;weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth&quot;. In this sense, outer darkness and spirit paradise are the two possible destinations for individuals immediately after death. This place of torment in the spirit world is much more commonly referred to by modern Latter-day Saints as spirit prison.

===Popular use: permanent abode of sons of perdition===
Second, in modern Latter-day Saint vernacular, &quot;outer darkness&quot; usually refers to an eternal state of punishment. Mortals who during their lifetime become sons of perdition—those who commit the unpardonable sin—will be consigned to outer darkness. It is taught that the unpardonable sin is committed by those who &quot;den[y] the Son after the Father has revealed him&quot;. However, according to Mormon faith, since most humans lack such an extent of religious enlightment, they cannot commit the Eternal sin, and the vast majority of residents of outer darkness will be the &quot;devil and his angels ... the third part of the hosts of heaven&quot; who in the pre-existence followed Lucifer and never received a mortal body. The residents of outer darkness who received a mortal body, while being resurrected like the rest of mankind, are the only children of God that will not receive one of three kingdoms of glory at the Last Judgment, remaining in that state of suffering for their own sins, for eternity. This state shares some similarities with certain Christian views of hell. On this subject, Joseph Smith taught that those who commit the unpardonable sin are &quot;doomed to &quot;Gnolaum&quot;—to dwell in hell, worlds without end.&quot; The word &quot;gnolaum&quot; is used elsewhere by Smith to mean &quot;eternal&quot; (in the sense of &#x27;everlasting&#x27; or &#x27;forever&#x27; with perpetuity in time, and likely not &quot;eternal&quot; as &#x27;outside of time&#x27; or having no relationship with the temporality). It is believed by Latter-day Saints that &quot;few&quot; people who have lived on the earth will be consigned to this state, but Latter-day Saint scripture suggests that at least Cain will be present.

===Meaning===
It is unclear in the teachings of Mormonism whether both the temporary and permanent uses of outer darkness refer to physical places or if both are merely descriptions of personal states of suffering and torment. The uncanonized LDS Church &quot;Bible Dictionary&quot; suggests that biblical &quot;expressions about &#x27;hell-fire&#x27; are probably ... figurative of the torment of those who willfully disobey God.&quot; It is also unclear whether sons of perdition will ultimately be redeemed; of outer darkness and the sons of perdition, Latter-day Saint scripture states that &quot;the end thereof, neither the place thereof, nor their torment, no man knows; Neither was it revealed, neither is, neither will be revealed unto man, except to them who are made partakers thereof.&quot;

<text>William Van Horn (born February 15, 1939) is an American Disney comics artist and writer, and has been since 1988. He draws mostly Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge stories, and he has also written and/or illustrated stories based on the animated series &quot;DuckTales&quot;. Some of these stories featured Launchpad McQuack as the main character. William&#x27;s son Noel Van Horn is also a Disney comics artist, focusing on Mickey Mouse stories.

==Work==
Prior to his association with Disney, Van Horn drew and wrote the black-and-white comic book &quot;Nervous Rex&quot; for Blackthorne Publishing. Focusing on the misadventures of a small, non-violent tyrannosaurus, the series ran for ten issues, from 1985 to 1987. Afterward, also for Blackthorne, he drew and wrote a short-lived superhero parody comic called &quot;Possibleman,&quot; which ran for two issues.

In the first years of his career as a Disney Comics artist William often worked with John Lustig on the stories. In 1994 he did the art for Carl Barks&#x27; final script, &quot;Horsing around with History&quot;, which was released in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #33 (October 1994).

Here is a list of characters William Van Horn created for the Duck universe:
* Baron Itzy Bitzy – a whistling flea that Scrooge has.
* Rumpus McFowl – Scrooge&#x27;s half brother who at first was believed to be Scrooge&#x27;s cousin.
* Woimly Filcher – an enemy of Donald Duck and his nephews.

He often draws a small fly or mosquito flying around his comics.

== Reprints ==

In November 2020 it was announced that Van Horn&#x27;s Disney comics would get comprehensively collected as a part of Fantagraphics &quot;Disney Masters&quot; line beginning in 2021.

<doc id="90740" wikidata="Q465025" url="?curid=90740" title="Ephrath">
<text>Ephrath or Ephrathah or Ephratah () is a biblically referenced former name of Bethlehem, meaning &quot;fruitful&quot;. It is also a personal name.

==Biblical place==
A very old tradition holds that Ephrath refers to Bethlehem, as the first mention of Ephrath occurs in Genesis, in reference to the place where Rachel died giving birth to Benjamin and was buried on the road from Bethel. Evidence that she died on the way there is reflected by the ancient Rachel&#x27;s tomb at the city&#x27;s entrance.

Throughout much of the Bible, Ephrath is a description for members of the Israelite tribe of Judah, as well as for possible founders of Bethlehem.

Ephrath, or Bethlehem, is connected to messianic prophecy, as found in the book of the minor prophet Micah: &quot;But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel.&quot; This specifies the town of Bethlehem in the southern part of biblical Israel (Judah/Judea), distinguishing it from the Bethlehem located in the north (Galilee). Both Matthew 2 and Luke 2 in the New Testament state that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea.

==Personal name==
Caleb&#x27;s second wife was called Ephrath (or Ephrathah).

==Locations named after Ephrath==
Some modern places named after Ephrath include:
*The Israeli settlement of Efrat, near Bethlehem
*The town of Ephrata, Pennsylvania
**The Ephrata Cloister, Pennsylvania, United States.
*The town of Ephratah, New York
*The town of Ephrata, Washington, United States.
*The locality and creek of Eprapah, Victoria Point, near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
** Nearby Coochiemudlo Island also has an Eprapah Street.
* Eprapah, the Scout environmental education training centre, located at Victoria Point, near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia

<doc id="90742" wikidata="Q1770842" url="?curid=90742" title="Uncle Scrooge">
<text>Uncle Scrooge (stylized as Uncle $crooge) is a Disney comic book series starring Scrooge McDuck (&quot;the richest duck in the world&quot;), his nephew Donald Duck, and grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and revolving around their adventures in Duckburg and around the world. It was first published in &quot;Four Color Comics&quot; #386 (March 1952), as a spin-off of the popular &quot;Donald Duck&quot; series and is still presently ongoing. It has been produced under the aegis of several different publishers, including Western Publishing (initially in association with Dell Comics and later under its own subsidiary, Gold Key Comics and their Whitman imprint), Gladstone Publishing, Disney Comics, Gemstone Publishing, Boom! Studios, and IDW Publishing, and has undergone several hiatuses of varying length. Despite this, it has maintained the same numbering scheme throughout its six decade history, with only IDW adding a secondary numbering that started at #1.

Besides Scrooge and his family, recurring characters include Gyro Gearloose, Gladstone Gander, Emily Quackfaster, and Brigitta MacBridge. Among the adversaries who make repeat appearances are the Beagle Boys, Magica De Spell, John D. Rockerduck and Flintheart Glomgold. &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; is one of the core titles of the &quot;Duck universe&quot;.

Its early issues by famed writer/artist (and creator of Scrooge McDuck) Carl Barks formed the inspiration for the syndicated television cartoon &quot;DuckTales&quot; in the late 1980s. Several stories written by Barks and published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; were adapted as episodes of &quot;DuckTales&quot;.

==Writers and artists==
The first 70 issues mostly consisted of stories written and drawn by Carl Barks. The 71st issue had a story written by Barks and drawn by Tony Strobl. Subsequent Gold Key Comics issues combined reprints of earlier Barks tales with new material by creators such as Strobl, Vic Lockman, Phil DeLara, Jack Manning, and Pete Alvarado.

When Gladstone Publishing relaunched the title in 1986, a new generation of American creators began contributing to the title, including Don Rosa, William Van Horn, John Lustig, Pat McGreal, Dave Rawson, and Michael T. Gilbert. As before, their work was intermingled with Carl Barks reprints, as well as with translations of European Disney comics by such creators as Daan Jippes, Fred Milton and Romano Scarpa originally published by Oberon, Egmont (originally Gutenberghus) and Disney Italy/Mondadori.

==U.S. publication history==

* Dell Comics: 1952–1962 (&quot;Four Color Comics&quot; issues 386, 456 and 495; issues 4–39)
* Gold Key Comics: 1962–1984 (issues 40–173 as Gold Key, 174–209 as Whitman)
* Gladstone Publishing: 1986–1990 (issues 210–242)
* Disney Comics: 1990–1993 (issues 243–280)
* Gladstone Publishing: 1993–1998 (issues 281–318)
* Gemstone Publishing: 2003–2008 (issues 319–383)
* Boom! Kids (Boom! Studios): 2009–2011 (issues 384–404)
* IDW Publishing: 2015–2020 (IDW #1-56, with &quot;legacy&quot; issue numbers 405–460 in brackets)

Scrooge made his first appearance in the Donald Duck story &quot;Christmas on Bear Mountain&quot; as a curmudgeonly man who decides to test Donald and his nephews to see if they are worthy of inheriting his wealth. Barks found the character and his wealth a useful springboard for stories and re-used him in a number of subsequent Donald Duck one-shot adventures and ten pagers appearing in &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;. By 1952 the popularity of the character convinced Dell to give Scrooge a try-out as a lead character in the seminal &quot;Only a Poor Old Man&quot; in Dell&#x27;s &quot;Four Color&quot; anthology series, a story Barks expert Michael Barrier has termed a masterpiece. After two further &quot;Four Color&quot; appearances Scrooge was granted his own title starting with issue number 4 (counting the try-out issues as one through three).

The series continued uninterrupted (though not always on a monthly schedule) until 1984, when Western Publishing (the parent company of Gold Key/Whitman, who were publishing the title at the time) withdrew from the comic book business. Western had held the Disney comic book license since the late 1930s, and their withdrawal left the license, and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;, in limbo for two years, when Another Rainbow, who had been publishing hardbound compilations of Carl Barks&#x27;s work for several years, acquired it and launched Gladstone Publishing, resuming the title where Whitman had left off.

Gladstone continued publishing &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; until their license expired in 1990. At that point, the series shifted over to Disney Comics with little change in editorial direction. It was one of only three monthly titles to survive the &quot;Disney implosion&quot; of 1991 (the others being &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; and &quot;Donald Duck Adventures&quot;), and continued to be published by Disney Comics until 1993, when Disney Comics folded and the license was reacquired by Gladstone Publishing. Gladstone went through their own implosion in 1998, and &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; was briefly converted into a double-sized (64 page), &quot;prestige&quot; format series, before Gladstone ended publication entirely later that year.

No further issues were published until 2003, when Gemstone Publishing (whose editorial staff included several former employees of Gladstone) acquired the license and resumed publication of &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot;. Gemstone maintained the prestige format previously adopted by Gladstone, and continued to publish the series until November 2008. Financial difficulties at Gemstone ended its run then, and the license was acquired by Boom! Studios, who reverted to the standard 32 page format when they began publication in late 2009. Boom&#x27;s run ended in 2011, when the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s acquisition of Marvel Entertainment lead to the consolidation of all Disney comics licenses under Marvel Comics.

In January 2015, IDW Publishing announced that they would be publishing the title, starting in April 2015. Apart from the single issues of the comic book, IDW Publishing also publishes the run in trade paperback collections compiling three issues each, but did also at one point collect the issues in hardcover collections under the title &quot;Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales&quot;. However the hardcover compilations ceased to come out after the third volume. The Trade paperbacks soon followed, and the last regular issue printed was 460 (IDW 56), leaving the series ending on a cliffhanger as the story was to be continued in the next issue.

===Other titles and spinoffs===
Over the years, Scrooge McDuck has proven popular enough to appear as the main character in a number of other comic book series. Many of these series include republications of stories originally written for the &quot;main&quot; &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; title in the United States or various European countries.

Scrooge often appeared in &quot;The Beagle Boys&quot; alongside his frequent adversaries, published irregularly by Gold Key from 1963 to 1979. When that title ended, it was relaunched as &quot;The Beagle Boys Versus Uncle Scrooge&quot; in March 1979 and lasted for twelve issues, until February 1980.

In 1987, Gladstone Publishing began publication of &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot;, which they would continue to publish until 1998, excluding the period from 1990 through 1993, when Disney Comics held the license to publish Disney comics.

Scrooge was also a major character in three different comic book titles tied in with the &quot;DuckTales&quot; television series. The first of these consisted of 13 issues and was published by Gladstone Publishing from 1987 to 1990. The second consisted of 18 issues published by Disney Comics from 1990 through 1991. The final (to date) was published over six issues by Boom! Kids in 2011. Several &quot;DuckTales&quot; comics starring Scrooge would also appear in the pages of &quot;Disney Adventures&quot; in the early 1990s.

Finally, &quot;The Adventurous Uncle Scrooge McDuck&quot;, published by Gladstone, ran for two issues in 1998. A third issue was planned but cancelled along with the rest of Gladstone&#x27;s output other than &quot;Uncle Scrooge&quot; and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; following a collapse in comics sales.

<doc id="90756" wikidata="Q1359465" url="?curid=90756" title="Erzulie">
<text>Erzulie (sometimes spelled Erzili or Èzili) is a family of loa, or spirits, in Vodou.

== Overview ==
The Erzulie is a family of loa that are often associated with water (fluidity), femininity, and feminine bodies. They are one of the only group of spirits directly tied to these characteristics and those who become possessed (through spirit possession) often are women or Masisi (effeminate and or homosexual men).

==Maîtresse Mambo Erzulie Fréda Dahomey==

&quot;Erzulie Fréda&quot; Dahomey, the Rada aspect of Erzulie, is the Haitian African spirit of love, beauty, jewelry, dancing, luxury, and flowers. She wears three wedding rings, one for each husband - Damballa, Agwe and Ogoun. Her symbol is a heart, her colors are pink, blue, white and gold, and her favorite offerings include jewelry, perfume, sweet cakes and liqueurs. Coquettish and very fond of beauty and finery, Erzulie Freda is femininity and compassion embodied, yet she also has a darker side; she is seen as jealous and spoiled and within some Vodoun circles is considered to be lazy. During ritual possession, she may enter the body of either a man or a woman. She enjoys the game of flirtation and seduces people without distinguishing between sexes.
In Christian iconography she is often identified with the Mater Dolorosa, as well as another loa named Metres Ezili. She is conceived of as never able to attain her heart&#x27;s most fervent desire. For this reason she always leaves a service in tears. Common syncretizations include Iyalorde Oxum, that is the goddess Oshun as she relates to the Yoruba goddess of erotic love, gold and femininity.

==Èrzulie Dantòr==

Erzulie Dantòr is the Queen of the Petro nation and the mother of &quot;Ti Jean Petro&quot;, she is often depicted as a fearsome black woman, protectively holding &quot;Ti Jean Petro&quot; in her arms. She is a particularly fierce protector of women, children and the neglects of society. She is the &quot;lwa pwen&quot;, in contrast with Èrzuli Freda who will bless you with material riches, Èrzulie Dantòr will give you the Spiritual Knowledge needed to navigate through this material reality. Èrzulie Dantòr&#x27;s wealth lasts and can be passed on from one generation to another, whereas Èrzuli Freda, in any of her jealous fits, can deprive you overnight of the gains she helped you to achieve. 

She is often portrayed to resemble the Black Madonna of Częstochowa, as she is represented as being dark-skinned with two scars on her face. Her colors are red, black and blue. Her favourite offerings include black pigs, &quot;griot&quot; (seasoned fried pork), blood (seven stabs of the sword), and rum.

Ti Jean Petro is her son and Jean Petro is her lover or husband.

<text>John Lustig (born January 25, 1953) is an American comics writer and former journalist, principally known for his Disney comics scripts featuring Donald Duck and other members of Disney&#x27;s Duck family. Lustig&#x27;s scripts have been illustrated by William Van Horn and other artists. In addition, Lustig has written Mickey Mouse scripts that have been drawn by Noel Van Horn (William&#x27;s son) and others. His first script was for Gold Key Comics (&quot;Flatfood Duck&quot; &quot;Daffy Duck&quot; #112 [Dec. 1977]), done just after graduating from college (it would be a decade before he wrote any other comics).

Lustig has also become known for his clever post-modern rescripting of panels from old romance comic pages previously published by Charlton Comics under the banner Last Kiss. Besides four issues of the comic book &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, the panels have also become a regular feature of &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and recently expanded into being featured on T-shirts, greeting cards, etc.

<doc id="90760" wikidata="Q255116" url="?curid=90760" title="Ogun">
<text>Ogun or Ogoun (Yoruba: Ògún, Edo: Ògún, Portuguese: Ogum, Gu; also spelled Oggun or Ogou; known as Ogún or Ogum in Latin America) is a Yoruba Orisha that is adopted in several African religions. Ògún is a warrior and a powerful spirit of metal work, as well as of rum and rum-making. He is also known as the &quot;god of iron&quot; and is present in Yoruba religion, Santería, Haitian Vodou, West African Vodun, and the folk religion of the Gbe people.
He attempted to seize the throne after the demise of Ọbàtálá, who reigned twice, before and after Oduduwa, but was ousted by Obalufon Ogbogbodirin and sent on an exile – an event that serves as the core of the Ọlọ́jọ́ Festival.

==Yoruba religion==

In Yoruba religion, Ogun is a primordial orisha in Yoruba Land. In some traditions, he is said to have cleared a path for the other orisha to enter Earth, using a metal axe and with the assistance of a dog. To commemorate this, one of his praise names, or &quot;oriki&quot;, is &quot;Osin Imole&quot; or the &quot;first of the primordial Orisha to come to Earth&quot;. He is the god of war and metals.

In his earthly life Ogun is said to be the first king of Ife. When some of his subjects failed to show respect, Ogun killed them and ultimately himself with his own sword. He disappeared into the earth at a place called Ire-Ekiti, with the promise to help those who call on his name. His followers believe him to have &quot;wo ile sun&quot;, to have disappeared into the earth&#x27;s surface instead of dying. Throughout his earthly life, he is thought to have fought for the people of Ire, thus is known also as Onire.

He is now celebrated in Ogun, Ekiti, Oyo, and Ondo States.

===Followers===

Ogun is the traditional deity of warriors, hunters, blacksmiths, technologists, and drivers in the Yoruba region. Followers of traditional Yoruba religion can swear to tell the truth in court by &quot;kissing a piece of iron in the name of Ogun.&quot; Drivers carry an amulet of Ogun to ward off traffic accidents.

===Symbols===

The primary symbols of Ogun are iron, the dog, and the palm frond. They symbolize Ogun&#x27;s role in transformation, mediation, and function. Iron is the primary emblem of Ogun. Ogun altars and ceremonies display and use iron objects both in Yoruba areas and across the African diaspora. Followers of Ogun wear chains of iron implements; Ogun festivals feature the display of knives, guns, blacksmith implements, scissors, wrenches, and other iron implements from daily life.

===Sacrifice===
Meats are sacrifices for Ogun. Dogs are the traditional companions of hunters, but Ogun&#x27;s personality is also seen as &quot;doglike&quot;: aggressive, able to face danger, and straightforward. Other sacrificial animals associated with Ogun are the spitting cobra (blacksnake); its behavior is aggressive and fearless. Hunters and blacksmiths avoid eating or witnessing the mating of blacksnakes. Other important sacrificial offerings to Ogun are the &quot;Clarias submarginatus&quot; (a species of catfish), alligator pepper, kola nuts, palm wine and red palm oil, small rats, roosters, salt, snails, tortoise, water, and yams. (Clyne: 1997). Many of these sacrificial offerings were carried into New World traditions.

Oríkì is a Yoruba cultural phenomenon that comes in the form of praise poetry, praising either a person, òrìṣà (deity), or town based on their achievements. Ogun worshippers are known to sing Ogun&#x27;s oríkì and this specific part insinuates that Ògún is in seven paths. 

*Ògún méje logun mi,
*Ògún alára ni n gb’aja,
*Ògún onire a gb’àgbò,
*Ògún Ikọla a gb&#x27;agbín,
*Ògún gbengbena oje ìgí nìí mu,
*Ògún ila a gb’esun iṣu,
*Ògún akirin a gb’awo agbo,
*Ògún elémono ẹran ahùn ni jẹ,
*mákindé ti dogun lẹyin odi,
*Bi o ba gba Tapa a gb’Aboki,
*A gba Ukuuku a gba Kèmbèrí.

Translation:

*My Ògún manifest in seven different ways
*Ogun of the town of Ilara accepts a dog atonement
*Ogun of the town of Ire accepts a ram atonement
*Ogun of the town of Ikole accepts a snail atonement
*Ogun of woodcarvers drinks tree sap for atonement
*Ogun of the town of Ila accept roasted yam atonement
*Ogun of the Akirin people accepts ram for atonement
*Ogun of the Elemono people eats tortoise meat for atonement
*The brave that wages foreign wars
*He will consume either Nupe, or Hausa
*He consumes foreign people, He will consume the Kanuri too.

==Dahomey religion==

In Dahomey religion, Gu is the vodun of war and patron deity of smiths and craftsmen. He was sent to earth to make it a suitable place for men to live happily, and he has not yet finished this task.

==Ewe religion==

In Ewe religion, Gu, also pronounced Egu, is the god of war and craftsmen especially blacksmiths.

Worshippers of Gu are not supposed to keep dogs as pets. Menstruating women are forbidden to touch the tools of the blacksmith. Adherents periodically make offerings of palm nuts, food and pour libations to Gu. Metal objects are also often purchased for offering in shrines dedicated to Gu.

==Candomblé==

Ogun is known in the Afro-Brazilian tradition of Candomblé as &quot;Ogum&quot; (Ketu, Ijexa and Efon nations) or &quot;Gu&quot; (Jeje nation). Ogum is syncretized with Saint George, notably in Rio de Janeiro and the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Candomblé tradition in Northeast Brazil, especially in Bahia, associates Ogum with Saint Sebastian or Saint Anthony.
===Characteristics===
*Consecrated day: Wednesday
*Metal: iron
*Element: earth
*Color: red, black, green (Rio de Janeiro), blue (Bahia), marine blue
*Food: feijoada, xinxim, yams
*Archetype: impetuous, authoritarian, cautious, hardworking, suspicious and a bit selfish
*Symbols: sword, broadsword, iron chain

Individual devotees of Ogun in Brazil avoid certain foods. These include goat, cajá-manga (&quot;Spondias dulcis&quot;), sugar, black beans, yams, and the manga-espada (an elongated mango cultivar of Brazil) in the Ketu nation; yams and manga-espada in the Ijexa nation; and partridge in the Jeje nation.

===Ritual sacrifice===

Ogun, as a male orisha (&quot;Boró&quot;), only &quot;eats&quot; male animals. Ox, billy goat, rooster, snake (typically a red snake), dog and game animals are sacrificed (&quot;orô&quot;) on festival days associated with Ogum in the Candomblé tradition.

===Ritual foods===

Acaçá is a ritual food offered to all gods in the Candomble pantheon; it is made of a paste of corn mash steamed in banana leaves. A variation, acaçá de feijão-preto, substitutes black beans (&quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;) for corn. This variation is only offered to Ogum in the Casa Fanti Ashanti temple in São Luís, in the state of Maranhão. Feijoada, a stew of beans with beef and pork, is also a common offering to Ogum.

==Santería and Palo==

Ogun&#x27;s centrality to the Yoruba religion has resulted in his name being retained in Santería religion, as well as the Shango religion of Trinidad and Tobago. In Santería, Ogún is syncretized with Saint Peter, James the Great, Saint Paul, Saint Michael the Archangel, and John the Baptist; he is the deity of war and metals.

==Vodou==

In Haitian Vodou Ogun is known as Ogou and consists of an array of manifestations; most carry the aspect of iron smithing and tools from the Yoruba tradition. The Ogou guard the &quot;badji&quot;, the sacred altar of the Vodou temple. He carries an iron saber and wears a red sash. Ogou is also the god of pioneering, intelligence, justice, medicine, and political power; these are associated with the symbol of the tool that can &quot;advance humans&#x27; mastery over the environment. Ogou Feray is the god of war. Other manifestations of Ogou are Ogou Badagri, Ogou Balenjo, Ogou Batala, and Ogou Je Wouj. Ezili Dantor is the female counterpart to Ogou.

Ogou Feray is syncretized with St. James the Greater (&quot;St. Jacques Majeur&quot;) in the Vodou tradition. He is a flower spirit and he guides Vodou followers against their enemies. He is symbolically covered in iron and may not be harmed by his enemies. As in Africa, his symbol is a piece of iron, a machete, or a knife. As in Africa, Ogou is revered among blacksmiths, many of whom are of Yoruba origin. He is also noted to like women and alcohol.

In Vodou ceremonies followers of Ogou wear a red shirt, pants, and scarf. A follower of Ogou in a possession-trance is offered Haitian white rum during the ceremony. In some ceremonies rum is burned in a container to allow Ogou to &quot;wash&quot; the hands of the followers.

Two Vodou songs to Ogou, as recorded and translated by Michel S. Laguerre:

Fè Ogou Fè, Ogou Fèray o,
Fè Ogou Fè, Ogou Fèray o

&quot;I am an iron,&quot;
&quot;I am covered with iron.&quot;

Fèrè Fèray tout ko Fèray sé kouto,
Fèrè Fèray tout ko Fèray sé manchèt.

&quot;The body of Ogou Fèray is covered with knives,&quot;
&quot;The body of Fèray is covered with machetes.&quot;

==In Brazil==
Léo Neto, et al. observed various kinds of animals used in sacrificial ritual in twelve Candomblé communities of Caruaru, Pernambuco and Campina Grande, Paraíba in the Northeastern region of Brazil between August 2007 and June 2008; dogs were the only sacrificial animal offered to Ogun in both communities.

<text>&quot;Horsing Around with History&quot; is a 24-page Disney comics story starring Scrooge McDuck, written by Carl Barks and drawn by William Van Horn. It was published in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures&quot; #33 (July 1995).

This was Barks&#x27; next-to-last story released in the United States (the last one being &quot;Somewhere in Nowhere&quot;). Barks came out of retirement to provide a script for this story and he chose William Van Horn to illustrate this story for him. This story was originally written to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Carl Barks&#x27; retirement.

It was also later printed in &quot;Uncle Scrooge Adventures in Color&quot; #56 (1 September 1998) and &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Uncle Scrooge: The Diamond Jubilee Collection&quot; # 1 (2022).

==Plot== 
Scrooge, Donald and the nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie are off to find ancient sunken treasure from the time of the Trojan War, unaware that the Beagle Boys are spying on them. The Ducks find the legendary Trojan Horse, but all the while they are followed by an albatross, which serves as a spy for the Beagle Boys.

<text>Noel Van Horn (born July 6, 1968) is a cartoonist born in the United States and living in Canada. He mainly produces Disney comics starring Mickey Mouse. He is the son of William Van Horn, a comics artist who is also well known for his work in Disney comics.

==Life and career==
Noel Van Horn was born on July 6, 1968, in San Francisco as the son of William Van Horn and a Canadian mother. Inspired by his father&#x27;s work as an animator when Noel was a child, he wanted to become an artist as well. Noel enjoyed the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; comic books in his childhood. In 1980, his family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. After finishing school, Van Horn studied animation at the Emily Carr College of Art and Design. In 1992, Van Horn went to San Diego in the United States, where he met Byron Erickson and Bob Foster, editors of Egmont, the Danish publisher of Disney comics. Van Horn wanted to draw Bucky Bug comics, but the Egmont editors were in search for Mickey Mouse comics artists. He accepted this offer and started an 18 months long training. Van Horn was instructed to form Mickey&#x27;s character vividly and to give him an American touch. Van Horn finally joined Egmont in 1993. Today, Noel Van Horn still lives in Vancouver with his wife. They have a son. Van Horn is a freelancing full-time artist at Egmont and works at home in his own studio.

Van Horn&#x27;s work is inspired by the American comics artists Dave Stevens and Floyd Gottfredson, but also by his father. Noel and William Van Horn have a similar style, but while Noel mostly uses characters from the Mickey Mouse universe, including Goofy, his father is specialized on the Scrooge McDuck universe. Noel wrote a single Donald Duck comic drawn by his father, &quot;To Bee Or Not To Bee&quot;, which was first published in 1998. In 2007, the first and only comic starring Bucky Bug drawn by Noel Van Horn was published on the occasion of this character&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Van Horn&#x27;s works are mainly published in European Disney comic books, especially in Scandinavian countries, Germany, and Poland.

<text>Grand Bois (meaning &quot;great wood&quot;, also Grans Bwa, Bran Bwa, Ganga-Bois; ) is an elemental, nature-oriented loa closely associated with trees, plants, and herbs in Haitian Vodou. Offerings to him include leaves and herbs, honey, and spiced rum. As a petro loa and loa of the wilderness, he can be fierce and unpredictable in some aspects.

Grand Bois, [[Kalfu|Maître Carrefour]] (Master Crossroads), and Baron Cimetière (Baron Cemetery) form the triad of magicians. They represent the journey of life: &quot;Grand Bois&quot; represents the rich earth that you spring from and the dark woods you stumble through, &quot;Maitre Carrefour&quot; represents the various roads and paths you choose to travel on, and &quot;Baron Cimitère&quot; represents the end of the trip. 

Grand Bois is represented by Saint Sebastian as his Catholic counterpart. His colors are commonly shades of green (sometimes including red in some houses).

<text>Kalfu (literally &quot;crossroads)&quot; is a lwa in Haitian Vodou. He is often envisioned as a young man or as a enigmatic spirit; his color is black or red and he favors rum infused with gunpowder. He is often syncretized with the Shadow.

<doc id="90774" wikidata="Q167577" url="?curid=90774" title="Lemba people">
<text>The Lemba, Remba, or Mwenye are an ethnic group which is native to South Africa, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe of mixed Bantu and Yemeni heritage. Within South Africa, they are particularly concentrated in the Limpopo province (historically around Sekhukuneland) and the Mpumalanga province.

Since the late twentieth century, there has been increased media and scholarly attention about the Lemba&#x27;s common descent from Semitic peoples. Genetic Y-DNA analyses have established a paternal Middle-Eastern origin for the majority of the Lemba population.

==Etymology==
It has been suggested that the exonym &quot;Lemba&quot; may originate in &quot;kilemba&quot; (most likely spread via the Mwera derivative &quot;chilemba&quot;), a Swahili word meaning turban. Thus, in context, the word &quot;Lemba&quot; as an ethnic identifier therefore translates to &quot;&#x27;those who wear turbans&quot;&#x27;.

Another theory is that the word &quot;Lemba&quot; may originate from the word &quot;lembi,&quot; a term which occurs in several Northeastern Bantu languages meaning a &quot;non-African&quot; or a &quot;respected foreigner&quot;.

The &#x27;Lemba&#x27; themselves prefer the name &quot;Mwenye&quot; as an exonym but call themselves &quot;Sena&quot; (or &quot;Sana&quot;) as an endonym for their city of origin.

==History==
===Oral traditions===

What is possibly the oldest recorded origin story of the Lemba people was documented by Henri-Alexandre Junod (a Swiss-born South African missionary). In 1908, he wrote:Some old Balemba of both the Spelonken and the Duiwelskloof country told my informant the following legend:

: &#x27;[&quot;We&quot;] &quot;have come from a very remote place, on the other side of the sea. We were on a big boat. A terrible storm nearly destroyed us all. The boat was broken into two pieces. One half of us reached the shores of this country; the others were taken away with the second half of the boat, and we do not know where they are now. We climbed the mountains and arrived among the Banyai. There we settled, and after a time we moved southwards to the Transvaal; but we are not the Banyai&quot;.
Tudor Parfitt interprets that the legend about the destruction of the boat and the division of the tribe is perhaps a way of explaining the fact that Lemba clans are to be found in several separate locations. However, it could equally be taken as an expression of a fractured sense of identity.

The original Sena was most likely located in Yemen, specifically in the ancient town of &quot;Sanā&quot; (also known as &quot;Sanāw&quot;) which is located within the easternmost portion of the Hadhramaut.

====Migration into Africa====
The Lemba claim that they settled in Tanzania and Kenya, building what was referred to as another Sena, or &quot;Sena II&quot;. Others supposedly settled in Malawi, where their descendants reside today. Some settled in Mozambique, eventually migrating to Zimbabwe and South Africa. They claim that their ancestors constructed Great Zimbabwe, now preserved as a monument. Ken Mufuka, a Zimbabwean archaeologist, believes that either the Lemba or the Venda may have participated in this architectural project but he does not believe that they were solely responsible for its completion. Writer Tudor Parfitt thinks that they may have helped construct the massive city.
Most academics who are experts in this field believe that the construction of the enclosure at Great Zimbabwe is largely attributable to the ancestors of the indigenous Shona. Such works were typical of their ancestral civilizations.

== Religion ==

Whilst most Lemba are Christians, there is also a sizeable minority of Lemba who are practicing Jews or Muslims. Edith Bruder wrote that &quot;from a theological point of view, the Lemba&#x27;s customs and rituals reveal religious pluralism and interdependence of these various practices&quot; and see membership of these religions &quot;in cultural rather than religious terms. These apparently religious identities do not prevent them from declaring themselves Jews through religious practice and ethnic identification.&quot; In 1992, Parfitt pointed to the strong cultural component in Lemba identification with Judaism. In 2002, Parfitt wrote that &quot;Those Lemba, who perceive themselves as ethnically Jewish, find no contradiction in regularly attending a Christian church.&quot;

In recent years, there has been a Jewish &quot;renaissance&quot; amongst the Lemba, with many of them reverting to religious Judaism under halakhic laws. Some Lemba have even made aliyah. Many religious holidays which were rarely celebrated due to urban migration and Evangelicalism in Africa are being celebrated by greater numbers of Lemba, with many communities coming together for passover seders all over the region.

=== Dietary laws which are followed by some Lemba who identify as Jewish ===
These Lemba practice dietary laws based on the books of Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Permitted and forbidden animals are seen in Leviticus 11:3–8 and Deuteronomy 14:4–8. Forbidden birds are listed in Leviticus 11:13–23 and Deuteronomy 14:12–20. The Lemba do not eat rodents, shellfish or any other &quot;sea-scavengers&quot; such as crustaceans, unlike in Islam, where consumption of prawns is permitted. Mixtures of milk and meat are not prepared or eaten, with traditional Lemba households having separate pots for each of them.

===Halakhic status as Jews===
In Orthodox Judaism Halakhic Jewish status is determined by documentation of an unbroken matrilineal line of descent and when no such line of descent exists, it is determined by conversion to Judaism. Jews who adhere to Orthodox or Conservative rabbinism believe that &quot;Jewish status by birth&quot; is only passed from a Jewish female to her children (if she herself is a Jew by birth or a Jew by conversion to Judaism) regardless of the Jewish status of the father. Because of the absence of matrilineal Jewish descent for the Lemba, Orthodox or Conservative Judaism would not recognise them as &#x27;Halakhically Jewish.&#x27; The Lemba would need to complete a formal conversion process in order to be accepted as Jews.

The Reform and Reconstructionist denominations, the Karaites, and Haymanot Jews all recognize patrilineage. As more is learned about the widespread history of the Jewish people, the Reform branch of Judaism has acknowledged the existence of an unusual line of descent outside the European and indigenous Middle Eastern Jewish spheres. Especially since the publication of the genetic results of the Lemba, American Jewish communities have reached out to the people, offering assistance, sending books on Judaism and related study materials, and initiating ties in order to teach the Lemba about Rabbinic Judaism. So far, few Lemba have converted to Rabbinic Judaism.

South African Jews of European descent have long been aware of the Lemba, but they have never accepted them as Jews or thought of them as more than an &quot;intriguing curiosity.&quot; Generally, the Lemba have not been accepted as Jews because of their lack of matrilineal descent. Several rabbis and Jewish associations support their recognition as descendants of the &quot;Lost Tribes of Israel&quot;. In the 2000s, the Lemba Cultural Association approached the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, asking for the Lemba to be recognized as Jews by the Jewish community. The Lemba Association complained that &quot;we like many non-European Jews are simply the victims of racism at the hands of the European Jewish establishment worldwide&quot;. They threatened to start a campaign to &quot;protest and ultimately destroy &#x27;Jewish apartheid&#x27;&quot;.

In Apartheid South Africa the Lemba were not recognized as an ethnic group which was distinct from other black South Africans. The Lemba Cultural Association face misconceptions about their goals such as the belief that the Lemba identify more with European Judaism, the belief that they aim to affiliate with European Jewry rather than other black Jews, and the belief that they are distanced from South African politics. However, while the Lemba do identify with their religious Judaism, many practice Christianity as well.

According to Gideon Shimoni, in his book, &quot;Community and Conscience: The Jews in Apartheid South Africa&quot; (2003): &quot;In terms of &quot;halakha&quot; the Lemba are not at all comparable to the Falasha [of Ethiopia]. As a group they have no conceivable status in Judaism.&quot;

Rabbi Bernhard of South Africa has stated that the only way for a member of the Lemba tribe to be recognised as a Jew is to undergo the formal Halakhic conversion process. After that, the person &quot;would be welcomed with open arms.&quot;

In May 2013, the Harare Lemba Synagogue was established in a rental building in Bluffhill, Harare, Zimbabwe with the assistance from Kulanu (organization)

As of 2015, the Lemba were building their first synagogue in Great Zimbabwe, Mapakomhere, in Masvingo District.

== Culture ==
The Lemba are divided into 12 primary clans: 

# Dumah
# Hamisi
# Bakari
# Sulaymani
# Tobakare / Tobakale
# Mani
# Haji
# Sadiqi
# Sharifu
# Hasani 
# Madi
# Manga

There are various different transliterations of these primary clans depending on location.

=== Marriage ===
The Lemba follow strict endogamous marriage practices, discouraging unions between Lemba and non-Lemba; mostly against tribes they live amongst (which they collectively refer to as &quot;Senji&quot;). Endogamy is also common among many groups.

=== Lemba&#x27;s role in Southern African society ===
According to Tooke, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Lemba were highly esteemed for their mining and metalwork skills by the surrounding tribes which lived in the Zoutpansberg region of South Africa. He wrote in his 1937 book that the other tribes considered the Lemba outsiders. According to articles which were written during the early 1930s, in the 1920s, the Lembas&#x27; medical knowledge earned them respect among tribes in South Africa. Parfitt believes that colonial Europeans had their own reasons for considering some tribes rather than other tribes indigenous to Africa, because they made the British believe that they had a right to be on the continent just like other migrants. Modern Y-DNA evidence confirms the extra-African origin of some of the Lemba&#x27;s male ancestors. By contrast, the lead anthropologist in Zimbabwe firmly places them among African peoples.

===Sacred ngoma===
Lemba tradition tells of a sacred object, the &quot;ngoma lungundu&quot; or the &quot;drum that thunders&quot;, which they brought from the place which was called Sena. Their oral history claims that the &quot;ngoma&quot; was the biblical Ark of the Covenant which was made by Moses. Parfitt, a professor at SOAS, University of London, wrote a book in 2008, &quot;The Lost Ark of the Covenant&quot; about the rediscovery of this object. His book was adapted into a television documentary that aired on the History Channel, tracing the Lemba&#x27;s claim that the &quot;ngoma lungunda&quot; was the legendary Ark of the Covenant. Following the lead of eighth-century accounts of the Ark in Arabia, Parfitt learned of a ghost town which was named Sena in the Hadhramaut.

Parfitt has suggested that the &quot;ngoma&quot; was related to the Ark of the Covenant, lost in Jerusalem after the city&#x27;s destruction by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 587 BC. He believes that the &quot;ngoma&quot; is a descendant of the biblical Ark, which may have been destroyed or may have been repaired when more material was added to it as the artifact began to wear out. He says that the ark/ngoma was carried to Africa by its priestly guardians. The Lemba people&#x27;s oral history claims that the Ark exploded 700 years ago, and was rebuilt on its remains.

Parfitt claims that he discovered the &quot;ngoma&quot; in a Harare, Zimbabwe museum in 2007. It had last been exhibited in 1949 by colonial officials in Bulawayo. They took it to Harare for protection during the struggle for independence, and it was later misplaced inside the museum. Parfitt said he believed that the ngoma was the oldest wooden artifact in Zimbabwe. In February 2010, the &#x27;Lemba ngoma lungundu&#x27; was put on display in the museum, along with a celebration of both its history and the history of the Lemba.

Parfitt says that the ngoma/ark was carried into battles. If it broke apart, it was rebuilt. The ngoma, he says, was possibly built from the remains of the original Ark. &quot;So it&#x27;s the closest descendant of the Ark that we know of,&quot; Parfitt says. &quot;Many people say that the story is far-fetched, but the oral traditions of the Lemba have been backed up by science&quot;, he said. The ngoma was on display in the Zimbabwe Museum of Human Sciences, but in 2008, it disappeared. The story of Parfitt and the ngoma was updated in 2014 in the ZDF documentary &quot;Tudor Parfitt and the Lost Tribe of Israel&quot;

The Lemba did not touch the &quot;ngoma&quot; because they considered it an intensely sacred object. It was carried by poles which were inserted into rings which were attached to each side of the &quot;ngoma&quot;. The only members of the tribe who were permitted to approach it were the male members of its hereditary priesthood because it was their responsibility to guard it. Other Lemba feared that if they ever touched it, they would be &quot;struck down by the fire of God&quot; which would erupt from the object. The Lemba continue to regard the ngoma as the sacred Ark.

== Jewish and Islamic links==

Many pre-modern Lemba beliefs and practices have been tentatively linked to Abrahamic religions. Ebrahim Moosa wrote that, &quot;Historians of religion have found among the Lemba certain religious and cultural practices which unmistakably resemble Middle Eastern rituals, and there are reflections of Hebrew and Arabic in their language.&quot;

According to Rudo Mathivha, a Lemba of South Africa, practices and beliefs which are related to Judaism include the following:
* They observe Shabbat.
* They praise &quot;Nwali&quot; (a deity) for looking after the Lemba, and they identify themselves as part of the chosen people.
* They teach their children to honour their mothers and fathers. (This is common to many ethnicities and religions.)
* They refrain from eating pig and other beasts which are forbidden by the Torah, and they forbid certain combinations of permitted foods.
* They practice ritual animal slaughter and ritual preparation of meat for consumption, a Middle Eastern practice rather than one which is common to African ethnicities.
* They practice male circumcision; according to Junod&#x27;s work in 1927, surrounding tribes regarded the Lemba as the masters and originators of that practice with their circumcision ceremonies involving recitations in Hebrew, Arabic and Kiswahili
* Traditionally, the Lemba are buried facing North (towards Jerusalem, as Zimbabwe is in the Southern Hemisphere) and stones are placed on tombs at the funeral.
* Since the late 20th century and due to an increasing amount of interest in their possible Jewish ancestry, they have placed Stars of David on their tombstones.
* Lemba are discouraged from marrying non-Lemba.

Some of these practices and traditions are not exclusively Jewish; they are common to Muslims in the Middle East and Africa, and they are also common to other African tribes and other non-African peoples. In the late 1930s, W. D. Hammond-Tooke wrote a book in which he identified Lemba practices that are similar to those of Arab Muslims: for instance, their practice of endogamy codified by Muslims and Jews, as are certain dietary restrictions. There are many similarities between Lemba and Jewish animal slaughter. Known to the Lemba as kuShisha (derived from the term Shechita), only a circumcised Lemba man who adheres to kashrut may slaughter an animal. If a non-Lemba or non-circumcised male kills the animal, even if it is killed within the same manner as the Lemba, the wider community cannot eat the meat. The Lemba also engage in ritual drinking, especially on high holidays. It is worth noting, considering the Lemba&#x27;s strict adherence to dietary and custom laws, if they were descendants of Muslims, it would be unlikely that they would partake of such activities, considering that it&#x27;s haram, suggesting closer links to Judaism than Islam.

In the late 20th century, the British scholar Tudor Parfitt, an expert on marginalized Jewish groups, became involved in researching the Lemba&#x27;s claims. He helped trace the origin of their ancestors back to Senna, an ancient city which they believe was located on the Arabian Peninsula, in present-day Yemen. In an interview which was featured on &quot;NOVA&quot; in 2000, Parfitt said he was struck by the Lemba&#x27;s maintenance of rituals which seemed Semitic and Judaic/Islamic:

In a 1931 article H.A. Stayt described them as an Arabic-Bantu tribe with Armenoid features, with on average, longer and thinner faces than that of the average Bantu, their lips are thinner, their noses longer and more aquiline and their eyes smaller, darker and deeper-set.

==Genetics==
===Uniparental DNA===
According to Y chromosome studies by Amanda B. Spurdle &amp; Trefor Jenkins (1996), Mark G. Thomas et al. (2000), and Himla Soodyall (2013), the Lemba are paternally most closely related to Semitic-speaking populations in Western Asia (Haplogroup J = 51.7%); Central and Southern Asians (LT,K,R,F = 24.5%); with minor contributions from Bantu speaking males.

The study by Thomas et al. (2000) revealed that a substantial number of Lemba men carry a particular haplotype of the Y-chromosome which is known as the Cohen modal haplotype (CMH), as well as a haplogroup of Y-DNA Haplogroup J which is found in some Jews, as well as in other populations which live across the Middle East and Arabia.

Among Jews, the CMH marker is most prevalent in Kohanim, or hereditary priests. As recounted in Lemba oral tradition, members of the Buba clan &quot;had a leadership role in bringing the Lemba out of Israel&quot;. The genetic study found that 50% of the males in the Buba clan had the Cohen marker, a proportion which is higher than that which is found in the general Jewish population. 

In order to more specifically define the Lemba people&#x27;s origins, in 2002 Parfitt and other researchers conducted a larger study in order to compare additional Lemba subjects (whose clans were recorded) with males from South Arabia and Africa, as well as Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews. They found that significant similarities exist between the markers of the Lemba and the markers of the men of the Ḥaḍramawt in Yemen. They also learned that the population of Sena, Yemen was relatively recent, so its members and the Lemba would not have shared common ancestors.

More recently, Mendez et al. (2011) observed that a moderately high frequency of the studied Lemba samples carried Y-DNA Haplogroup T, which is also considered to be of Near Eastern origin. The Lemba T carriers exclusively belonged to T1b, which is rare and was not sampled in indigenous Jews of either the Near East or North Africa. T1b has been observed in low frequencies in Ashkenazi Jews as well as in a few Levantine populations. Some Lemba women have also carried markers denoting descendance from the Near East.

A study conducted by Himla Soodyall (2013) observed that the non-African Y component in the Lemba is around 73.7% to 79.6%. However, overall, the study shows that Y chromosomes which are typically linked to Jewish ancestry were not detected through higher resolution analysis. It seems more likely that Arab traders, who are known to have established long-distance trade networks which stretched thousands of kilometers along the western rim of the Indian Ocean, from Sofala in the south to the Red Sea in the north and beyond, to the Hadramut, to India, and even to China from about 900 AD, are more likely linked with the ancestry of the non-African founding males of the Lemba/Remba.

In a 2016 publication, Himla Soodyall and Jennifer G. R Kromberg state that:

<text>L&#x27;inglesou is a Vodou &quot;loa&quot; (spirit) who supposedly lives in the wild areas of Haiti and kills anyone who offends him.

==Portrayal==
He executes judgment on those who cannot keep their word, including any &quot;oungan&quot; or &quot;mambo&quot; who cannot keep the secrets of voodoo from the uninitiated. L&#x27;inglesou is feared and respected by all. He almost never comes in possession, but when he does, he must be served correctly, or the &quot;houngan&quot; or &quot;mambo&quot; will be cruelly punished.

When L&#x27;inglesou comes in possession, he eats only glasses and razor blades and drinks warm bull&#x27;s blood. His color is red. He is syncretized with the Sacred Heart of Jesus. He likes sharp objects such as knives, scissors, barbed wire, razor blades and, in general, anything that will rip or tear flesh.

<doc id="90779" wikidata="Q6727083" url="?curid=90779" title="Mademoiselle Charlotte">
<text>Mademoiselle Charlotte is a loa who manifests with the commonly perceived personality traits of a white woman in Haitian Vodou. Appearances in Voodoo ceremonies are rare, possibly as a result of her non-African origin. According to tradition, both Mademoiselle Charlotte and Dinclinsin came to Haiti with the colonists and only began appearing in ceremonies at that time.

Mademoiselle Charlotte prefers the strict observance of all the niceties of ritual protocol. She generally speaks French and will grant the ability to speak that language to a &quot;horse&quot; with no knowledge of it during the time in which she manifests. Mademoiselle Charlotte is served in a manner similar to that of Erzulie. She enjoys sweet rose-, blue-, white-, or cream-colored beverages, water sweetened with syrup, any type of non-alcoholic liqueurs, clairin, and acassan (a drink consisting of boiled cornmeal sweetened with highly refined cane juice). She prefers the tender meat of young chickens as her ritual food offering. Her color is rose. Her services are difficult to obtain as she only works for people to whom she takes a fancy.

<doc id="90785" wikidata="Q189635" url="?curid=90785" title="Eagles (band)">
<text>The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1971. With five number-one singles, six number-one albums, six Grammy Awards and five American Music Awards, the Eagles were one of the most successful musical acts of the 1970s in North America and are one of the world&#x27;s best-selling music artists, having sold more than 200million records worldwide, including 100million sold in the US alone. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998 and were ranked number 75 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2010 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. Founding members Glenn Frey (guitar, vocals), Don Henley (drums, vocals), Bernie Leadon (guitar, vocals), and Randy Meisner (bass guitar, vocals) had all been recruited by Linda Ronstadt as band members, some touring with her, and all playing on her self-titled third solo studio album (1972), before venturing out on their own as the Eagles on David Geffen&#x27;s new Asylum Records label.

Their debut studio album, &quot;Eagles&quot; (1972), spawned two top-20 singles in the US and Canada: &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;. The next year&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Desperado&quot;, peaked at only number 41 in the US, although the title song became a popular track. In 1974, guitarist Don Felder joined, and &quot;On the Border&quot; produced the top-40 hit &quot;Already Gone&quot; and the Eagles&#x27; first number-one song in the US and Canada, &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, which made the top 15 in Australia, their first hit overseas. In 1975, the album &quot;One of These Nights&quot; became their first number-one album in the US and a top ten album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, which was their first top ten hit outside of North America, and US top-5 songs &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot; and &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;. Also in 1975, Leadon left the band and was replaced by guitarist and vocalist Joe Walsh.

&quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot; (1976) is the best-selling album in the United States, with 38 million copies sold, and primed the public for the late 1976 release of &quot;Hotel California&quot;, which would sell more than 26million copies in the US (ranking third all-time for US sales), and more than 32million copies worldwide. The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, &quot;New Kid in Town&quot; and &quot;Hotel California&quot;, the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, while also reaching the top ten in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.

Meisner was replaced by Timothy B. Schmit in 1977. The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with &quot;The Long Run&quot;, spawning the North American number-one song &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits &quot;The Long Run&quot; and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot;. The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the Long Road Out of Eden Tour. In 2013, they began the extended History of the Eagles Tour in conjunction with the documentary release, &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;. Following Frey&#x27;s death in January 2016, the Eagles re-formed in 2017, with Glenn&#x27;s son Deacon Frey and country singer Vince Gill sharing lead vocals for Frey&#x27;s songs. Deacon left the band in 2022, but returned in 2023 to participate in the band&#x27;s ongoing final tour. Meisner died in 2023.

==History==
===1971–1973: formation and early releases===
The Eagles had their origin in early 1971, when Linda Ronstadt and her manager John Boylan recruited musicians Glenn Frey and Don Henley for her band. Henley had moved to Los Angeles from Texas with his band Shiloh to record an album produced by Kenny Rogers, and Frey had come from Michigan and formed Longbranch Pennywhistle; the two then met in 1970 at The Troubadour in Los Angeles and became acquainted through their mutual record label, Amos Records. Randy Meisner, who had been working with Ricky Nelson&#x27;s backing band, the Stone Canyon Band, and Bernie Leadon, a veteran of the Flying Burrito Brothers, also later joined Ronstadt&#x27;s group of performers for her summer tour promoting the &quot;Silk Purse&quot; album.

While on the tour with Ronstadt, Frey and Henley decided to form a band together and informed Ronstadt of their intention. Frey later credited Ronstadt with suggesting Leadon for the band, and arranging for Leadon to play for her so Frey and Henley could approach him about forming a band together. They also pitched the idea to Meisner and brought him on board. These four played live together behind Ronstadt only once for a July concert at Disneyland, but all four appeared on her self-titled album. It was later proposed that JD Souther should join the band, but Meisner objected. The four were signed in September 1971 to Asylum Records, the new label started by David Geffen, who was introduced to Frey by Jackson Browne. Geffen bought out Frey&#x27;s and Henley&#x27;s contracts with Amos Records, and sent the four to Aspen, Colorado, to develop as a band. Having not settled on a band name yet, they performed their first show in October 1971 under the name of Teen King and the Emergencies at a club called The Gallery in Aspen.

The idea of naming the band &quot;Eagles&quot; came during a peyote and tequila-influenced group outing in the Mojave Desert. However, accounts of the origin of the name vary; Don Felder, who had yet to join the Eagles and was not at the desert, credited Leadon with originating the name when he recalled reading about the Hopis&#x27; reverence for the eagle, while Souther suggested that the idea came when Frey shouted out, &quot;Eagles!&quot; when they saw eagles flying above. Steve Martin, a friend of the band from their early days at The Troubadour, recounts in his autobiography that he suggested that they should be referred to as &quot;the Eagles&quot;, but Frey insists that the group&#x27;s name is simply &quot;Eagles&quot;. Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts initially managed the band; they were later replaced by Irving Azoff while the Eagles were recording their third album.

The group&#x27;s self-titled debut album was recorded in England in February 1972 with producer Glyn Johns. Johns was impressed by the harmony singing of the band, and he has been credited with shaping the band into &quot;the country-rock band with those high-flyin&#x27; harmonies&quot;. Released on June 1, 1972, &quot;Eagles&quot; was a breakthrough success, yielding three Top 40 singles. The first single and lead track, &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, was a song written by Frey with his neighbor and fellow country-folk rocker Jackson Browne. Browne had written the first verse of the song, but got stalled on the second verse after the line &quot;I&#x27;m standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona.&quot; Frey completed the verse, and Browne carried on to finish the song. The song reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was followed by the bluesy &quot;Witchy Woman&quot; and the soft country rock ballad &quot;Peaceful Easy Feeling&quot;, charting at number 9 and number 22 respectively. The group were one of the support acts for Yes on their Close to the Edge Tour.

Their second album, &quot;Desperado&quot;, took Old West outlaws for its theme, drawing comparisons between their lifestyles and modern rock stars. During these recording sessions, Henley and Frey began collaborating. They co-wrote eight of the album&#x27;s eleven songs, including &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot;, two of the group&#x27;s most popular songs. The album was less successful than the first, reaching only number 41 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and yielding two singles, &quot;Tequila Sunrise&quot;, which reached number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and &quot;Outlaw Man&quot;, which peaked at number 59. With Henley and Frey co-writing the bulk of the album, the album marked a significant change for the band. The pair also began to dominate in terms of leadership; the early assumption had been that Leadon and Meisner as veteran musicians would have a greater influence on the band.

===1973–1975: &quot;On the Border&quot; and &quot;One of These Nights&quot; ===
For their next album, &quot;On the Border&quot;, Henley and Frey wanted the band to break away from the country rock style and move more towards hard rock. The Eagles initially started with Glyn Johns as the producer for this album, but he tended to emphasize the lush side of their double-edged music. After completing only two usable songs, the band turned to Bill Szymczyk to produce the rest of the album. Szymczyk wanted a harder-edged guitarist for the song &quot;Good Day in Hell&quot; and the band remembered Bernie Leadon&#x27;s childhood friend Don Felder, a guitarist who had jammed backstage with the band in 1972 when they opened for Yes in Boston. Felder had been nicknamed &quot;Fingers&quot; at the jam by Frey, a name that stuck due to his guitar proficiency. In January 1974, Frey called Felder to add slide guitar to the song &quot;Good Day in Hell&quot; and the band was so impressed that they invited him to join the group as the fifth Eagle the next day. He appeared on one other song on the album, the up-tempo breakup song &quot;Already Gone&quot;, on which he performed a guitar duet with Frey. &quot;Already Gone&quot; was released as the first single from the album and it reached number 32 on the charts. &quot;On the Border&quot; yielded a number 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; single (&quot;Best of My Love&quot;), which hit the top of the charts on March 1, 1975. The song was the Eagles&#x27; first of five chart-toppers. The album included a cover version of the Tom Waits song &quot;Ol&#x27; &#x27;55&quot; and the single &quot;James Dean&quot;, which reached number 77 on the charts.

The band played at the California Jam festival in Ontario, California, on April 6, 1974. Attracting more than 300,000 fans and billed as &quot;the Woodstock of the West Coast&quot;, the festival featured Black Sabbath, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Deep Purple, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Seals &amp; Crofts, Black Oak Arkansas, and Rare Earth. Portions of the show were telecast on ABC television in the United States, exposing the Eagles to a wider audience. Felder missed the show when he was called away to attend the birth of his son; Jackson Browne filled in for him on piano and acoustic guitar.

The Eagles released their fourth studio album, &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, on June 10, 1975. A breakthrough album for the Eagles, making them international superstars, it was the first in a string of four consecutive number 1 albums. The dominant songwriting partnership of Henley and Frey continued on this album. The first single was the title track, which became their second consecutive chart-topper. Frey called it his all-time favorite Eagles tune. The second single was &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;, which reached number 2 on the charts and won the band their first Grammy for &quot;Best Pop Performance by a duo or group with vocal&quot;. The final single, &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;, was written by Meisner, Henley, and Frey, and it is the only Eagles single to feature Meisner on lead vocals. The song reached number 4 on the charts. The band launched a huge worldwide tour in support of the album, and the album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Album of the Year. The group was featured on the cover of the September 25, 1975 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and on September 28, the band joined Linda Ronstadt, Jackson Browne, and Toots and the Maytals for a show in front of 55,000 people at Anaheim Stadium.

&quot;One of These Nights&quot; was their last album to feature founding member Bernie Leadon. Leadon wrote or co-wrote three songs for the album, including &quot;I Wish You Peace&quot;, written with his girlfriend Patti Davis (daughter of California governor Ronald Reagan and Nancy Reagan); and the instrumental &quot;Journey of the Sorcerer&quot;, which would later be used as the theme music for the BBC&#x27;s radio and television versions of &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;. Leadon was disillusioned with the direction the band&#x27;s music was taking and his loss of creative control as their sound was moving from his preferred country to rock and roll. His dissatisfaction, principally with Frey, boiled over one night when Frey was talking animatedly about the direction they should take next, and Leadon poured a beer over Frey&#x27;s head, and said, &quot;You need to chill out, man!&quot; In December 1975, after months of denials, it was announced that Leadon had left the band.

===1975–1978: major success with &quot;Hotel California&quot; ===

Leadon&#x27;s replacement was guitarist and singer Joe Walsh, who had been a friend of the band for some years. He had previously performed with James Gang, Barnstorm, and as a solo artist; he was also managed by Azoff and used Szymczyk as his record producer. There was some initial concern as to Walsh&#x27;s ability to fit in with the band, as he was considered too &quot;wild&quot; for the Eagles, especially by Henley. After the departure of Leadon, the Eagles&#x27; early country sound almost completely disappeared, with the band employing a harder sound with the addition of Felder and Walsh; however, Felder also had to play banjo, pedal steel, and mandolin on future tours, something that had previously been Leadon&#x27;s domain.

In early 1976, the band released their first compilation album, &quot;Their Greatest Hits (1971–1975)&quot;. The album became the highest-selling album of the 20th century in the United States, and has since sold 38million copies in the U.S. (excluding streams and tracks) and 42million copies worldwide. It stayed the biggest seller of all time until it was taken over by Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; following the artist&#x27;s death in 2009. The album cemented the group&#x27;s status as the most successful American band of the decade.

The following album, &quot;Hotel California&quot;, released on December 8, 1976, was the band&#x27;s fifth studio album and the first to feature Walsh. The album took a year and a half to complete, a process that, along with touring, drained the band. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;, became the Eagles&#x27; third number-one single.
The second single was the title track, which topped the charts in May 1977 and became the Eagles&#x27; signature song. It features Henley on lead vocals, with a guitar duet performed by Felder and Walsh. The song was co-written by Felder, Henley, and Frey. The mysterious lyrics have been interpreted in many ways, some of them controversial. Rumors even started in certain quarters that the song was about Satanism. The rumor was dismissed by the band and later by Henley in the documentary film &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;. Henley told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in 2007 that &quot;it&#x27;s basically a song about the dark underbelly of the American Dream and about excess in America, which was something we knew about.&quot;

With its hard rock sound, &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; was also a major success that established Walsh&#x27;s position in the band. The third and final single from &quot;Hotel California&quot;, it reached number 11 on the charts. The ballad &quot;Wasted Time&quot; closes the first side of the album, while an instrumental reprise of it opens the second side. The album concludes with &quot;The Last Resort&quot;, a song that Frey once referred to as &quot;Henley&#x27;s opus&quot;, but which Henley described as &quot;fairly pedestrian&quot; and &quot;never fully realized, musically speaking&quot;.

The run-out groove on side two has the words &quot;V.O.L. Is Five-Piece Live&quot; etched into the vinyl, which means that the instrumental track for the song &quot;Victim of Love&quot; was recorded live in the studio, with no overdubs. Henley confirms this in the liner notes of &quot;The Very Best Of.&quot; However, the song was a point of contention between Don Felder and the rest of the band. In the 2013 documentary, Felder claimed that he had been promised the lead vocal on &quot;Victim of Love&quot;, for which he had written most of the music. After many unproductive attempts to record Felder&#x27;s vocal, band manager Irving Azoff was delegated to take Felder out for a meal, removing him from the mix while Don Henley overdubbed his lead vocal. &quot;Hotel California&quot; appeared at number 37 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the best albums of all time, and is the band&#x27;s best-selling studio album, with more than 26million copies sold in the U.S. alone and more than 32million copies worldwide.

The album won Grammys for &quot;Record of the Year&quot; (&quot;Hotel California&quot;) and &quot;Best Arrangement for Voices&quot; (&quot;New Kid in Town&quot;). &quot;Hotel California&quot; topped the charts and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 1978 Grammy Awards, but lost to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rumours.&quot; The huge worldwide tour in support of the album further drained the band members and strained their personal and creative relationships.

&quot;Hotel California&quot; is the last album to feature founding member Randy Meisner, who abruptly left the band after the 1977 tour. The Eagles had been touring continuously for eleven months; the band was suffering from the strain of the tour, and Meisner&#x27;s stomach ulcers had flared up by the time they arrived in Knoxville in June 1977. Meisner had been struggling to hit the crucial high notes in his signature song, &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;, and decided to not sing the song as an encore at the Knoxville concert because he had been up late and caught the flu. Frey and Meisner then became engaged in arguments about Meisner&#x27;s reluctance to perform, which turned into an angry physical confrontation backstage. Meisner left the venue. After the incident, Meisner was frozen out from the band, and he decided to leave the group at the end of the tour and return to Nebraska to be with his family. His last performance was in East Troy, Wisconsin, on September 3, 1977. The band replaced Meisner with the same musician who had succeeded him in Poco, Timothy B. Schmit, after agreeing that Schmit was the only candidate.

In 1977, the group, minus Don Felder, performed instrumental work and backing vocals for Randy Newman&#x27;s album &quot;Little Criminals&quot;, including &quot;Short People&quot;, which has backup vocals by Frey and Schmit.

===1978–1980: &quot;The Long Run&quot; and breakup===
The Eagles went into the recording studio in 1978 to begin work on their next album, &quot;The Long Run&quot;. The album took a year-and-a-half to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. &quot;The Long Run&quot; was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to &quot;Hotel California&quot;, it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot; became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The title track and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot; both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;. &quot;In the City&quot; by Walsh and &quot;The Sad Cafe&quot; became live staples. The band also recorded two Christmas songs during these sessions, &quot;Funky New Year&quot; and &quot;Please Come Home for Christmas&quot;, which was released as a single in 1978 and reached number 18 on the charts.

Frey, Henley, and Schmit contributed backup vocals for the single release of &quot;Look What You&#x27;ve Done to Me&quot; by Boz Scaggs. A different version with female backing vocals appears on the &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; soundtrack, along with the Eagles&#x27; 1975 hit &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;.

On July 31, 1980, in Long Beach, California, tempers boiled over into what has been described as the &quot;Long Night at Wrong Beach&quot;. The animosity between Felder and Frey boiled over before the show began, when Felder said, &quot;You&#x27;re welcome – I guess&quot; to California Senator Alan Cranston&#x27;s wife as the politician was thanking the band backstage for performing a benefit for his re-election. Frey and Felder spent the entire show telling each other about the beating each planned to administer backstage. &quot;Only three more songs until I kick your ass, pal,&quot; Frey recalled Felder telling him near the end of the band&#x27;s set. Felder recalls Frey telling him during &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m gonna kick your ass when we get off the stage.&quot;

It appeared to be the end of the Eagles, but the band still had a commitment with Elektra Records to make a live record from the tour. &quot;Eagles Live&quot; (released in November 1980) was mixed on opposite coasts. Frey had already left the band and would remain in Los Angeles, while the other band members each worked on their parts in Miami. &quot;We were fixing three-part harmonies courtesy of Federal Express,&quot; said producer Bill Szymczyk. Frey refused to speak to the other Eagles, and he fired Irving Azoff as his manager. With credits that listed five attorneys, the album&#x27;s liner notes simply said, &quot;Thank you and goodnight.&quot; A single released from the album – &quot;Seven Bridges Road&quot; – had been a live concert staple for the band. It was written by Steve Young in an arrangement created by Iain Matthews for his &quot;Valley Hi&quot; album in 1973. The song reached number 21 on the charts in 1980, becoming the Eagles&#x27; last Top 40 single until 1994.

===1980–1994: hiatus===

After the Eagles broke up, the former members pursued solo careers. Elektra, the band&#x27;s long-time record label, initially owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles. Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, but it was uncharted waters for the others.

Walsh released a successful album in 1981, &quot;There Goes the Neighborhood,&quot; but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s were less well received. During this period, Walsh performed as a session musician for Dan Fogelberg, Steve Winwood, John Entwistle, Richard Marx and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, among others, and produced and co-wrote Ringo Starr&#x27;s &quot;Old Wave&quot; album.

Henley achieved commercial solo success. In 1981, he sang a duet with Stevie Nicks (Fleetwood Mac), &quot;Leather and Lace&quot;. In 1982, he released &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still,&quot; featuring the hit &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;. The next album, &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot; (1984), featured &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; (a &quot;Billboard&quot; number 5 hit), &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Dance&quot; (number 9), &quot;Not Enough Love in the World&quot; (number 34) and &quot;Sunset Grill&quot; (number 22). Henley&#x27;s next album, &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot; (1989), was also a major success. It included &quot;The End of the Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Last Worthless Evening&quot; and &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;. His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.

Frey achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, &quot;No Fun Aloud&quot;, which spawned the number 15 hit &quot;The One You Love&quot;. &quot;The Allnighter&quot; (1984) featured the number 20 hit &quot;Sexy Girl&quot;. He reached number 2 on the charts with &quot;The Heat Is On&quot; from the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with &quot;You Belong to the City&quot; from the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot;. He appeared as &quot;Jimmy&quot; in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode&#x27;s soundtrack. He also contributed the songs &quot;Flip City&quot; to the &quot;Ghostbusters II&quot; soundtrack and &quot;Part of Me, Part of You&quot; to the soundtrack for &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise.&quot;

Former music writer Cameron Crowe had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982, his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High.&quot; The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit, and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot;.

Felder released a solo album, and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;: &quot;Heavy Metal (Takin&#x27; a Ride)&quot; (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and &quot;All of You&quot;. He also had a minor hit, &quot;Bad Girls&quot;, off his solo album &quot;Airborne.&quot;

Schmit had a prolific solo career after the band&#x27;s initial breakup. He had a hit song on the &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; soundtrack with &quot;So Much in Love&quot;. He contributed vocals to the Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash album &quot;Daylight Again&quot; on the songs &quot;Southern Cross&quot; and &quot;Wasted on the Way&quot; when that band needed an extra vocalist due to David Crosby&#x27;s drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on Toto&#x27;s &quot;Toto IV&quot; album, including the song &quot;I Won&#x27;t Hold You Back&quot; and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983–1985) as a member of Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Coral Reefer band. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with &quot;Boys&#x27; Night Out&quot; and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;, both from his album &quot;Timothy B.&quot; Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on Richard Marx&#x27;s debut single &quot;Don&#x27;t Mean Nothing&quot;. In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr&#x27;s All-Starr Band and appeared on the live video from the Montreux Jazz Festival. Schmit released two solo albums, &quot;Playin&#x27; It Cool&quot; in 1984 and &quot;Tell Me the Truth&quot; in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles,&quot; singing backing vocals on Vince Gill&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Tell You Why&quot;.

Meisner hit the top 40 three times, including the number 19 &quot;Hearts on Fire&quot; in 1981.

===1994–2001: reunion, &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;===
An Eagles country tribute album, titled &quot;Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles&quot;, was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup. Travis Tritt insisted on having the &quot;Long Run&quot;-era Eagles in his video for &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and they agreed. Following years of public speculation, the band formally reunited the following year. The lineup comprised the five &quot;Long Run&quot;-era members—Frey, Henley, Walsh, Felder, and Schmit—supplemented by Scott Crago (drums), John Corey (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), Timothy Drury (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals), and former Loggins and Messina sideman Al Garth (sax, violin) on stage.

&quot;For the record, we never broke up, we just took a 14-year vacation,&quot; said Frey at their first live performance in April 1994, one of two shows performed to record a live album and companion MTV special, both titled &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; (named for Henley&#x27;s recurring statement that the group would get back together &quot;when hell freezes over&quot;); the album debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. It included four new studio songs, with &quot;Get Over It&quot; and &quot;Love Will Keep Us Alive&quot; both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved successful, selling six million copies in the U.S.

The band subsequently embarked on a tour in 1994, which was interrupted in September because of Frey&#x27;s serious recurrence of diverticulitis, but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996. In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For the induction ceremony, all seven Eagles members (Frey, Henley, Felder, Walsh, Schmit, Leadon, and Meisner) played together for two songs, &quot;Take It Easy&quot; and &quot;Hotel California&quot;. Several subsequent reunion tours followed (without Leadon or Meisner), notable for their record-setting ticket prices.

The Eagles performed at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas on December 28 and 29, 1999, followed by a concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on December 31. These concerts marked the last time Felder played with the band and the shows (including a planned video release) would later form a part of a lawsuit filed by Felder against his former bandmates. The concert recordings were released on CD as part of the four-disc &quot;Selected Works: 1972–1999&quot; box set in November 2000. Along with the concert, this set included the band&#x27;s hit singles, album tracks and outtakes from &quot;The Long Run&quot; sessions. &quot;Selected Works&quot; received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2002. The group resumed touring in 2001, with a line-up consisting of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit, along with Steuart Smith (guitars, mandolin, keyboards, backing vocals; essentially taking over Felder&#x27;s role), Michael Thompson (keyboards, trombone), Will Hollis (keyboards, backing vocals), Scott Crago (drums, percussion), Bill Armstrong (Horns), Al Garth (sax, violin), Christian Mostert (sax), and Greg Smith (sax, percussion).

===2001–2007: Don Felder lawsuit===

On February 6, 2001, Don Felder was fired from the Eagles. He responded by filing two lawsuits against &quot;Eagles, Ltd.&quot;, a California corporation; Don Henley, an individual; Glenn Frey, an individual; and &quot;Does 1–50&quot;, alleging wrongful termination, breach of implied-in-fact contract and breach of fiduciary duty, reportedly seeking $50million in damages. Felder alleged that from the 1994 &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; tour onward, Henley and Frey had &quot;...insisted that they each receive a higher percentage of the band&#x27;s profits ...,&quot; whereas the money had previously been split in five equal portions. Felder accused them of coercing him into signing an agreement under which Henley and Frey would receive three times as much of the &quot;Selected Works: 1972–1999&quot; proceeds.

On behalf of Henley and Frey, attorney Daniel M. Petrocelli responded by saying &quot;[Henley and Frey] felt—creatively, chemistry-wise and performance-wise—that he should no longer be part of the band ... They removed him, and they had every legal right to do so. This has been happening with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll bands since day one.&quot; Henley and Frey then countersued Felder for breach of contract, alleging that Felder had written a &quot;tell-all&quot; book, &quot;Heaven and Hell: My Life in the Eagles (1974–2001)&quot;.

On January 23, 2002, the Los Angeles County Superior Court consolidated the two complaints, set a trial date for September 2006, and the single case was dismissed on May 8, 2007, after being settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.

In 2003, the Eagles released a greatest hits album, &quot;The Very Best Of&quot;. The two-disc compilation was the first that encompassed their entire career from &quot;Eagles&quot; to &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;. It debuted at number 3 on the Billboard charts and eventually gained triple platinum status. The album included a new single, the September 11 attacks-themed &quot;Hole in the World&quot;. Also in 2003, Warren Zevon, a longtime Eagles friend, began work on his final album, &quot;The Wind&quot;, with the assistance of Henley, Walsh, and Schmit.

On June 14, 2005, the Eagles released a new 2-DVD set, &quot;Farewell 1 Tour-Live from Melbourne&quot;, featuring two new songs: Frey&#x27;s &quot;No More Cloudy Days&quot; and Walsh&#x27;s &quot;One Day at a Time.&quot; A special edition 2006 release, exclusive to Walmart and affiliated stores, includes a bonus audio CD with three new songs that were to appear on their upcoming studio album: &quot;No More Cloudy Days&quot;, &quot;Fast Company&quot;, and &quot;Do Something&quot;.

The initial U.S. release of Felder&#x27;s book was canceled after publisher Hyperion Books backed out in September 2007, when an entire print run of the book had to be recalled for cuts and changes. The book was published in the United Kingdom on November 1, 2007. The American edition was published by John Wiley &amp; Sons on April 28, 2008, with Felder embarking on a full publicity campaign surrounding its release.

===2007–2012: &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; world tour and possible eighth album===

In 2007, the Eagles consisted of Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit. On August 20, 2007, &quot;How Long&quot;, written by JD Souther, was released as a single to radio with an accompanying online video at Yahoo! Music. It debuted on television on Country Music Television on August 23, 2007. The band had performed the song as part of their live sets in the early to mid-1970s, but did not record it at the time because Souther wanted to reserve it for use on his first solo album. Souther had previously worked with the Eagles, co-writing some of their biggest hits, including &quot;Best of My Love&quot;, &quot;Victim of Love&quot;, &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, and &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;.

On October 30, 2007, the Eagles released &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, their first album of all-new material since 1979. For the first year after the album&#x27;s release, it was available in the U.S. only via the band&#x27;s website, at Walmart, and at Sam&#x27;s Club stores. It was commercially available through traditional retail outlets in other countries. The album debuted at number 1 in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Norway. It became their third studio album and seventh release overall to be certified at least seven times platinum by the RIAA. Henley told CNN that &quot;This is probably the last Eagles album that we&#x27;ll ever make.&quot;

The Eagles made their awards show debut on November 7, 2007, when they performed &quot;How Long&quot; live at the Country Music Association Awards.
On January 28, 2008, the second single of &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; was released. &quot;Busy Being Fabulous&quot; peaked at number 28 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart and at number 12 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The Eagles won their fifth Grammy in 2008, in the category Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for &quot;How Long&quot;.

On March 20, 2008, the Eagles launched their world tour in support of &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; at The O2 Arena in London. The Long Road Out of Eden Tour concluded the American portion of the tour at Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah, on May 9, 2009. It was the first concert ever held in the new soccer stadium. The tour traveled to Europe, with its final concert date on July 22, 2009, in Lisbon. The band spent the summer of 2010 touring North American stadiums with the Dixie Chicks and Keith Urban. The tour expanded to England as the headline act of the Hop Farm Festival on July 1, 2011.

Asked in November 2010 whether the Eagles were planning a follow-up to &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, Schmit replied, &quot;My first reaction would be: no way. But I said that before the last one, so you never really know. Bands are a fragile entity and you never know what&#x27;s going to happen. It took a long time to do that last album, over a span of years, really, and it took a lot out of us. We took a year off at one point. I&#x27;m not sure if we&#x27;re able to do that again. I wouldn&#x27;t close the door on it, but I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Walsh said in 2010 that there might be one more album before the band &quot;wraps it up&quot;. Frey later stated in a 2012 interview that the band has had discussions about releasing an EP of potentially 4–6 songs that may contain both original and cover material.

===2013–2016: &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;, Glenn Frey&#x27;s death, and second hiatus===

In February 2013, the Eagles released a career-spanning documentary called &quot;History of the Eagles&quot; and began the supporting tour with 11 US arena concerts in July. Henley said that the tour, which expanded internationally and continued until July 2015, &quot;could very well be our last...we&#x27;re gonna include at least one former band member in this tour and kinda go back to the roots, and how we created some of these songs. We&#x27;re gonna break it down to the fundamentals and then take it up to where it is now.&quot; Original Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon also appeared on the tour. Walsh stated, &quot;Bernie’s brilliant, I never really got a chance to play with him, but we&#x27;ve been in contact. We see him from time to time, and I&#x27;m really glad he&#x27;s coming because it&#x27;s going to take the show up a notch, and I&#x27;m really looking forward to playing with him, finally.&quot; Former members Randy Meisner and Don Felder did not appear. Meisner had been invited but could not participate for health reasons, while Felder was never asked. Though his lawsuits against the Eagles were settled in 2007, Henley claimed that Felder continued to &quot;engage in legal action, of one kind or another&quot; against the band, but did not state what those actions were.

The Eagles (Frey, Henley, Walsh, and Schmit) were slated to receive Kennedy Center Honors in 2015, but this was deferred to 2016 due to Frey&#x27;s health problems.

On January 18, 2016, founding member Glenn Frey died at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City at the age of 67. The causes of his death were rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis, and pneumonia while recovering from intestinal surgery.

At the 58th Annual Grammy Awards in February, the Eagles, joined by Leadon, touring guitarist Steuart Smith, and co-writer Jackson Browne, performed &quot;Take It Easy&quot; in honor of Frey. In subsequent interviews, Henley stated that he did not think the band would perform again.
===2017–present: Return to touring, new line-up and Meisner&#x27;s death===
Despite Henley&#x27;s statements the previous year, the band continued on and headlined the Classic West and Classic East concert in July 2017, which were organized by their manager Irving Azoff. Glenn Frey&#x27;s son Deacon performed in his father&#x27;s place, along with country musician Vince Gill. At the Classic West concert, the band was joined by Bob Seger who sang &quot;Heartache Tonight&quot;, which he co-wrote. The band then continued to tour in the fall in the U.S.

The first and only studio recording by the band without Glenn Frey to date was released in autumn 2017, a cover of Dan Fogelberg&#x27;s &quot;Part of the Plan&quot; for the album &quot;A Tribute to Dan Fogelberg&quot;.

Further touring occurred again in North America with Gill and Deacon Frey, beginning in March 2018. Henley&#x27;s son Will joined the touring band as a guitarist for this run of shows. The band also toured Europe and Oceania in early 2019. The first live release of the new lineup came in 2020, when footage of the band&#x27;s 2018 leg was released as a concert TV special on ESPN with the soundtrack released in October, the first live release without Glenn Frey. A live album of the concert, &quot;Live from the Forum MMXVIII&quot;, was released in October 2020.

The band performed their 1976 album &quot;Hotel California&quot; in its entirety during three concerts at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada in September and October 2019. The shows also included another set of the band&#x27;s greatest hits. The line-up included a 46-piece orchestra and a 22-voice choir. Following the Las Vegas shows, the band announced the Hotel California 2020 Tour to take place in six cities between February 7 and April 18, 2020.

After just ten shows in early 2020, the remainder of the Hotel California Tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tour resumed in 2021, with North American dates spanning August to November. The band then announced the tour would continue into 2022, with dates in both the U.S. and Europe. On April 6, 2022, the band announced on their Facebook page that Deacon Frey was leaving the group in order to pursue a solo career. Frey has since guested with the band on numerous occasions starting in June of that year.

On July 6, 2023, the band announced their farewell tour, The Long Goodbye Tour to commence on September 7, 2023, at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, with Deacon Frey again joining the band. Later that month, on July 26, founding bassist Randy Meisner died at the age of 77 from complications related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, leaving Henley and Leadon as the two remaining original members. In a joint press statement confirming the news, the band described Meisner as &quot;an integral part of the Eagles and instrumental in the early success of the band&quot;.

In a 2022 interview with Loudersound, Schmit expressed doubt that the band would record a follow-up to &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot;, stating &quot;I sincerely doubt it. We toured behind our last album, &quot;Long Road Out Of Eden&quot; [2007], and put in five to seven of those songs. But we don&#x27;t do them any more because there wasn&#x27;t a big reaction. When people come to see the Eagles they want to hear &#x27;Best Of My Love&#x27;, &#x27;One Of These Nights&#x27;, all these things. So we give it to them.&quot;
In September 2024, the Eagles began a concert residency at Sphere in the Las Vegas Valley. The first eight concerts grossed $42.2 million from 131,000 tickets sold. The shows are scheduled to continue into April 2025.

In 2025, touring lead guitarist Steuart Smith was replaced by Chris Holt. Smith retired due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Musical style==
Influenced by 1960s rhythm and blues, soul, bluegrass, and rock bands such as the Byrds and Buffalo Springfield, the Eagles&#x27; overall sound has been described as &quot;California rock&quot;. In the words of Sal Manna, author of the CD liner notes of the band&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot;, &quot;no one knew quite what &#x27;California rock&#x27; meant – except perhaps that, because in California anything was possible, music that came from that promising land was more free-spirited and free-ranging.&quot;

The group&#x27;s sound has also been described as country rock, soft rock, and folk rock, and in later years the band became associated with the album rock and arena rock labels.

On their early records, the group combined rock and roll, country, and folk music styles. For their third album &quot;On the Border,&quot; the band widened their style to include a prominent hard rock sound, a genre the band had only touched upon previously. The 1975 follow-up album &quot;One of These Nights&quot; saw the group explore a softer sound, notably exemplified on the hit singles &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;, and &quot;Lyin&#x27; Eyes&quot;. Leadon, who was the principal country influence, left the band after the album was released, and the band moved away from country rock to a more rock direction in &quot;Hotel California&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2007 comeback album &quot;Long Road Out of Eden&quot; saw them explore country rock, blues rock, and funk.
