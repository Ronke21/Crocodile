<text>Priene (; ) was an ancient Greek city of Ionia (and member of the Ionian League) located at the base of an escarpment of Mycale, about north of what was then the course of the Maeander River (now called the &quot;Büyük Menderes&quot; or &quot;Big Maeander&quot;). It was from ancient Anthea, from ancient Aneon and from ancient Miletus. The city was built on the sea coast, overlooking the former Latmian Gulf of the Aegean. It was developed on steep slopes and terraces extending from sea level to a height of above sea level at the top of the escarpment. Because of siltation from the river filling the bay over several centuries, the city is now an inland site. It is located at a short distance west of the modern village Güllübahçe Turun in the Söke district of Aydın Province, Turkey.

Priene is known to have been the site of high-quality Hellenistic art and architecture. The city&#x27;s original position on Mount Mycale has never been discovered; however, it is believed that it was on a peninsula with two harbours. Priene never held a great deal of political importance due to the city&#x27;s relatively limited size, as it is believed around four to five thousand inhabitants occupied the region. The city was arranged into four districts, firstly the political district, which consisted of the &quot;bouleuterion&quot; and the &quot;prytaneion&quot;; the cultural district containing the theatre; the commercial, where the agora was located; and finally the religious district, which contained sanctuaries dedicated to Zeus, Demeter and, most importantly, the Temple of Athena.

=== Earliest cities ===

The city visible on the slopes and escarpment of Mycale was constructed according to plan entirely during the 4th century BCE. The original Priene had been a port city situated at the then mouth of the Maeander River. This location caused insuperable environmental difficulties, due to slow aggradation of the riverbed and progradation in the direction of the Aegean Sea. Typically the harbour would silt over, so that residents were living in pest-ridden swamps and marshes.

The Maeander flows through a slowly subsiding rift valley, creating a drowned coastline. Human use of the previously forested slopes and valley removed trees and exposed soils to erosion. The sediments were progressively deposited in the trough at the mouth of the river, which migrated westward and more than compensated for the subsidence.

Physical remains of the original Priene have not yet been identified. It is believed they are likely to be buried under many feet of sediment. The top is now cultivated as valuable agricultural land. Knowledge of the average rate of progradation is the basis for estimating the location of the city, which was moved closer to the water again every few centuries in order to operate as a port.

The Greek city (there may have been unknown habitations of other ethnicities, as at Miletus) was founded by a colony from the ancient Greek city of Thebes in the vicinity of ancient Aneon at about 1000 BCE. At about 700 BCE a series of earthquakes were the catalyst to move the city to within of its 4th century BCE location. At about 500 BCE, the city moved again to the port of Naulochos.

===4th century BCE city===
At about 350 BCE the Persian-empire satrap, Mausolus (a Carian), planned a magnificent new city on the steep slopes of Mycale. He hoped it could be a permanent deep-water port (similar to the many Greek island cities, located on and up seaside escarpments). Construction had begun when the Macedonians took the region from the Persian Empire, and Alexander the Great personally assumed responsibility for the development. He and Mausolus intended to make Priene a model city. Alexander offered to pay for construction of the Temple of Athena to designs of the noted architect Pytheos, if it would be dedicated by him, which it was, in 323 BCE. The dedicatory inscription is held by the British Museum. The inscription translated to: &quot;King Alexander dedicated the temple to Athena Polias&quot;.

The leading citizens were quick to follow suit: most of the public buildings were constructed at private expense and are inscribed with the names of the donors.

The ruins of the city are generally conceded to be the most spectacular surviving example of an entire ancient Greek city; it is intact except for the ravages of time. It has been studied since at least the 18th century. The city was constructed of marble from nearby quarries on Mycale, and wood for such items as roofs and floors. The public area is laid out in a grid pattern up the steep slopes, drained by a system of channels. The water distribution and sewer systems survive. Foundations, paved streets, stairways, partial door frames, monuments, walls, terraces can be seen everywhere among toppled columns and blocks. No wood has survived. The city extends upward to the base of an escarpment projecting from Mycale. A narrow path leads to the acropolis above.

===Later years===

Despite the expectations, Priene lasted only a few centuries as a deep-water port. In the 2nd century CE Pausanias reports that the Maeander already had silted over the inlet in which Myus stood, and that the population had abandoned it for Miletus.
While Miletus apparently still had an open port then, according to recent geoarchaeological research, Priene had already lost the port and open connection to the sea in about the 1st century BCE. Its merchants likely had preceded most residents in relocation to Miletus. By 300 CE the entire Bay of Miletus, except for Lake Bafa, was silted in.

Today Miletus is many miles from the sea. Priene stands at the edge of a fertile plain, now a checkerboard of privately owned fields. A Greek village remained after the population decline. After the 12th century CE, more Turkish people moved into the area. In the 13th century CE Priene was known as &quot;Sampson&quot;, in Greek, after the biblical hero Samson (Samsun Kale, &quot;Samson&#x27;s Castle&quot; in Turkish). In 1204, Sabas Asidenos, a local magnate, established himself as the city&#x27;s ruler, but soon had to recognize the rule of the Empire of Nicaea. The area remained under Byzantine control until the late 13th century.

By 1923, whatever Greek population remained was expelled in the population exchange between Greece and Turkey following World War I. Shortly after, the Turkish population moved to a more favourable location, which they called Güllü Bahçe (&quot;rose garden&quot;). The old Greek settlement, partly still in use, is today known as Gelebeç or Kelebeş. The tourist attraction of Priene is accessible from there.

== Contemporary geography ==

=== Territory ===

In the 4th century BCE, Priene was a deep-water port with two harbours overlooking the Bay of Miletus and, somewhat further east, the marshes of the Maeander Delta. Between the ocean and steep Mycale, agricultural resources were limited. Priene&#x27;s territory likely included a part of the Maeander Valley, needed to support the city. Claiming much of Mycale, it had borders on the north with Ephesus and Thebes, a small state on Mycale.

Priene was a small city-state of 6000 persons living in a constrained space of only . The walled area had an extent of to . The population density of its residential district has been estimated at 166 persons per hectare, living in about 33 homes per hectare (13 per acre) arranged in compact city blocks. The entire space within the walls offered not much more space and privacy: the density was 108 persons per hectare. All the public buildings were within walking distance, except that walking must have been an athletic event due to the vertical components of the distances.

=== Society ===
Priene was a wealthy city, as the plenitude of fine urban homes in marble and the private dedications of public buildings suggests. In addition, historical references to the interest of Mausolus and Alexander the Great indicate its standing. One third of the houses had indoor toilets, a rarity in this society. Typically cities had public banks of outdoor seats, side by side, an arrangement for which the flowing robes of the ancients were suitably functional. Indoor plumbing requires more extensive water supply and sewage systems. Priene&#x27;s location was appropriate in that regard; they captured springs and streams on Mycale, brought the water in by aqueduct to cisterns, and piped or channeled from there to houses and fountains. Most Greek cities, such as Athens, required getting water from the public fountains (which was the work of domestic servants). The upper third of Prienean society had access to indoor water.

The source of Ionian wealth was maritime activity; Ionia had a reputation among the other Greeks for being luxurious. The intellectuals, such as Heraclitus, often railed against their practices.

=== Government ===

Although the stereotyped equation of wealth with aristocracy may have applied early in Priene&#x27;s history, in the 4th century BCE the city-state was a democracy. State authority resided in a body called the Πριηνείς (Priēneis), &quot;the Prieneian people&quot;, who issued all decrees and other public documents in their name. The coins minted at Priene featured the helmeted head of Athena on the obverse and a meander pattern on the reverse; one coin also displayed a dolphin and the legend ΠΡΙΗ for ΠΡΙΗΝΕΩΝ (Priēneōn), &quot;of the Prieneians.&quot; These symbols express the Prieneians identification as a maritime democracy aligned with Athens but located in Asia.

The mechanism of democracy was similar to but simpler than that of the Athenians (whose population was much larger.) An assembly of citizens met periodically to render major decisions placed before them. The day-to-day legislative and executive business was conducted by a &quot;boulē&quot;, or city council, which met in a &quot;bouleuterion&quot;, a space like a small theatre with a wooden roof. The official head of state was a &quot;prytane&quot;. He and more specialized magistrates were elected periodically. As at Athens, not all the population was franchised. For example, the property rights and tax responsibilities of a non-Prieneian section of the population living in the countryside, the &quot;pedieis&quot;, &quot;plainsmen&quot;, were defined by law. They were perhaps, an inheritance from the days when Priene was in the valley.

==History==

Priene was said to have been first settled by Ionians under Aegyptus, a son of Belus and grandson of King Codrus, in the 11th century BCE. After successive attacks by Cimmerians, Lydians under Ardys, and Persians, it survived and prospered under the direction of its &quot;sage,&quot; Bias, during the middle of the 6th century BCE. Cyrus captured it in 545 BCE; but it was able to send twelve ships to join the Ionic Revolt (499 BCE-494 BCE).

Priene was a member of the Athenian-dominated Delian League in the 5th century BCE. In 387 BCE it came under Persian dominance again, which lasted until Alexander the Great&#x27;s conquest. Disputes with Samos, and the troubles after Alexander&#x27;s death, brought Priene low. Rome had to save it from the kings of Pergamon and Cappadocia in 155.

Orophernes, the rebellious brother of the Cappadocian king, who had deposited a treasure there and recovered it by Roman intervention, restored the Temple of Athena as a thank-offering. Under Roman and Byzantine dominion Priene had a prosperous history. It passed into Muslim hands late in the 13th century.

==Archaeological excavations and current state==
The ruins, which fell on the successive terraces where they were built, were the object of investigatory missions sent out by the English Society of Dilettanti in 1765 and 1868. They were excavated by Theodor Wiegand (1895–1899) for the Berlin Museum.

The city, as developed at this site that was new in the 4th century, was found to have been laid out on a rectangular scheme. The steep area faces south, the acropolis rising nearly behind it. The city was enclosed by a wall thick, with towers at intervals and three principal gates.

On the lower slopes of the acropolis was a sanctuary of Demeter. The town had six main streets, about wide, running east and west, and fifteen streets about wide crossing at right angles, all being evenly spaced. It was thus divided into about 80 &quot;insulae&quot;. Private houses were apportioned eight to an insula. The systems of water-supply and drainage are still visible. The houses present many analogies with the earliest ones of Pompeii.

In the western half of the city, on a high terrace north of the main street and approached by a fine stairway, was the temple of Athena Polias. It was a hexastyle peripteral structure in the Ionic order built by Pytheos, the architect of the Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halikarnassos, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. In 1870, silver tetradrachms of Orophernes, and some jewellery were found in excavations under the base of the statue of Athena. These were probably deposited at the time of the Cappadocian restoration.
An ancient Priene Synagogue, with carved images of the menorah, has also been discovered.

Around the agora, the main square crossed by the main street, is a series of halls. The municipal buildings, buleuterion and prytaneion, lie north of the agora. Further to the north is the Upper Gymnasium with Roman baths, and the well-preserved Hellenistic theatre. These and most other public structures are at the centre of the plan. Temples of Asclepius and the Egyptian gods Isis, Serapis and Anubis, have been revealed. At the lowest point on the south, within the walls, was the large stadium. In Hellenistic times, it was connected with a gymnasium.

<text>Blois ( ; ) is a commune and the capital city of Loir-et-Cher department, in Centre-Val de Loire, France, on the banks of the lower Loire river between Orléans and Tours.

With 45,898 inhabitants by 2019, Blois is the most populated city of the department, and the 4th of the region.

Historically, the city was the capital of the County of Blois, created on 832 until its integration into the Royal domain in 1498, when Count Louis II of Orléans became King Louis XII of France. During the Renaissance, Blois was the official residence of the King of France.

==History==

=== Pre-history ===

Since 2013, excavations have been conducted by French National Institute of Preventive Archaeological Research (&quot;INRAP&quot; in French) in Vienne where they found evidence of &quot;one or several camps of late Prehistory hunter-gatherers, who were also fishermen since fishing traps were found there.. [...] They were ancestors of the famous Neolithic farmer-herders, who were present in current France around 6,000 BCE [i.e.: 8,000 years ago].&quot;

=== Ancient times ===

A major urban development begun in 1959 uncovered the remains of a late Gallic settlement and an urban centre from the Gallo-Roman period. At that time, the town was located on the road linking Chartres to Bourges. In the network of cities of the Carnutes people, Blois was a secondary settlement. Excavations carried out on the right bank between 2001 and 2016 and on the left bank in 2013-2014 revealed the presence of a large developed town on the right bank and an occupation on the left bank from the Gallic and Gallo-Roman periods. The Loire river has undoubtedly always been a major axis route, although no traces of a port have been discovered. However, there are remains of former bridges linking the two banks.

=== Middle Ages ===
Though of ancient origin, Blois is first distinctly mentioned by Gregory of Tours in the 6th century, and the city gained some notability in the 9th century, when it became the seat of a powerful countship known as &quot;Blesum castrum&quot; by the counts of Blois.

The Robertians were at the head of the county of Blois before 900. When Hugh the Great became duke of the Franks, he left the title of count to his faithful vassal, Theobald I of Blois (&quot;circa&quot; 940). His descendants, known as &quot;Thibaldians&quot;, remained as Counts up until the county became a royal possession in 1397. The House of Blois also succeeded in raising some of its members or descendants to the highest levels of the European nobility, notably by acceding to the thrones of France, England, Navarre, Spain and Portugal.

In 1171, Blois was the site of a blood libel against its Jewish community that led to 31 Jews (by some accounts 40) being burned to death. Their martyrdom also contributed to a prominent and durable school of poetry inspired by Christian persecution. In 1196, Count Louis I of Blois granted privileges to the townsmen; a commune, which survived throughout the Middle Ages, probably dates from this time. The counts of the Châtillon dynastic line resided at Blois more often than their predecessors, and the oldest parts of the Château of Blois (from the 13th century) were built by them.

In the Middle Ages, Blois was the seat of the County of Champagne when the latter passed to the French crown in 1314, forming the province of Champagne within the Kingdom of France. By 1397, Count Guy II of Blois-Châtillon offered the county to his cousin, Duke Louis I of Orléans, brother of King Charles VI. In 1429, Joan of Arc made Blois her base of operations for the relief of Orléans. She rode the 35 miles on 29 April from Blois to relieve Orléans. In 1440, after his captivity in England, Duke Charles of Orléans (son of Duke Louis I) took up residence in the Château of Blois, where in 1462 his son was born, Duke Louis II of Orléans who would afterwards become Louis XII.

=== Renaissance era ===

By 1498, King Charles VIII died with no heirs in the Château of Amboise. Subsequently, Duke Louis II ran 22 miles between the Château and Blois, and was crowned King Louis XII of France. He then married Charles VIII&#x27;s widow, Queen Anne of Brittany, in 1499. The birth of their daughter, Claude of France, effected the union of Brittany with the France. Louis XII, as the last hereditary Count of Blois, naturally established his royal Court in the city. The Treaty of Blois, which temporarily halted the Italian Wars, was signed there in 1504–1505. During his reign, the city experienced a massive redevelopment, with some architectural elements inspired from the Italian Renaissance, as seen in the medieval castle immediately turned into a château, and the construction of many &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot; for the nobility throughout the entire kingdom. One of which, &quot;Hôtel d&#x27;Alluye&quot;, was built as a copy of an Italian palace for Florimond Robertet, who was an important French minister under King Charles VIII, King Louis XII and King Francis I.

On 1 January 1515, Louis XII died. His throne would be passed to Francois I, the husband to his daughter, Claude of France. In 1519, King Francois I ordered the construction of the Château of Chambord (10 miles away from Blois), but its construction lasted for one year before he died in 1547. In the meantime, he gradually expressed his will to move to Fontainebleau, near Paris, and started to abandon Blois. Much of the royal furniture was moved from Blois to Fontainebleau by 1539.

The French Wars of Religion were a significantly destructive conflict for the French people. The city&#x27;s inhabitants included many Calvinists, and in 1562 and 1567 it was the scene of struggles with the Catholics. On 4 July 1562, Blois and Beaugency, conquered by Protestants just before, were looted by the Catholics led by Maréchal de St. André. On 7 February 1568, Protestants under Captain Boucard&#x27;s command, looted and invaded the town, eventually killing many Catholics. Grey friars were also killed and thrown in the well of their own convent. In addition, all the churches were ransacked. In 1576 and 1588, King Henry III convoked the Estates General to Blois where he attained refuge after an uprising called the Day of the Barricades. In response, Duke Henry I of Guise was assassinated on 23 December 1588 for his involvement in the uprising. The following day, his brother, Cardinal Louis II of Guise, who was also Archbishop of Reims, suffered the same fate. Their deaths were shortly followed by that of the Queen-Mother, Catherine de&#x27; Medici.

In the 16th century, the French Royal court often made Blois their leisure resort.

=== Early modern era ===
After the departure of the Royal Court towards Paris, Blois lost the status of a Royal residence, along with the luxury and economic activity that came with it. King Henry IV relocated the Royal library to Fontainebleau, which would later be the National Library of France ().

In 1606, Philippe de Béthune gave his ownership of &quot;Vienne-lez-Blois&quot; village, on the left bank of the Loire river, to Blois, making it a part of the city afterwards known as Blois-Vienne. From 1617 to 1619 Marie de&#x27; Medici, wife of King Henri IV, exiled from the court by his son, King Louis XIII, lived in the château. By 1622, the Counter-Reformation arrived in Blois and a Society of Jesus was founded. St. Louis Chapel, which is today St. Vincent Church was also built at this time.

Then in 1634, Louis XIII exiled his brother, Gaston, Duke of Orléans and Count of Blois, who became attached to the city. The Duke in 1657, found a hospital in Blois-Vienne, now named &quot;Résidence Gaston d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, and financed the reconstruction of the Hôtel-Dieu. He remained in Blois until his death, in 1660.

Under Louis XIV&#x27;s reign, Blois became un independent bishopric. David Nicolas de Bertier, first bishop of Blois from 1697, chose as his seat the cathedral church of St. Solenne, that had been destroyed by a storm and was under reconstruction, before being completed 3 years later in 1700, thanks to the intervention of Colbert&#x27;s wife, who herself came from Blois. The new edifice became Blois Cathedral and was dedicated to St. Louis.

A large episcopal palace was built by King Louis XIV&#x27;s official architect, Jacques Gabriel, right next to the newly built cathedral, on a site overlooking the Loire Valley. Landscaping of terraced gardens began in 1703 and lasted nearly 50 years. The so-called Bishopric Gardens were first open to the public in 1791 by Henri Grégoire (known as the Abbot Grégoire), the first constitutional bishop after the French Revolution.

During the night of 6-7 February 1716, the medieval bridge collapsed. Construction of a new one was ordered the following year. Jacques-Gabriel Bridge was inaugurated in 1724. All the levies were consolidated, and the river channel of &quot;La Bouillie&quot; in the prolongation of La Creusille Harbour was closed and dried.

When Duke Gaston of Orléans died, the château was stripped by King Louis XIV, and completely abandoned, to the point that King Louis XVI once considered demolishing it in 1788. The building was saved when the Royal-Comtois Regiment established their base within it.

In 1790, Orléanais province was dissolved, the Département of Loir-et-Cher was created with Blois as the local capital.

By 1814, Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma and wife of Napoleon I, found refuge in Blois.

=== Contemporary era ===

There was new development in Blois in the 19th century. Firstly, the railway arrived in 1846 with the inauguration of the Paris–Tours railway, whose Blois Station is a stop. The competition with river transport gradually forced La Creusille Harbor to reinvent its activity. In parallel, the city became more industrialised from 1848 thanks to a successful chocolate brand created by Bloisian, Victor-Auguste Poulain.

As in Paris, urban organisation in Blois was redesigned during 1850 and 1870 by Mayor Eugène Riffault, who was friends with Baron Georges-Eugène Haussmann. Thus, he had built a boulevard separating the modern upper town (where the cathedral, &quot;Hôtel of Préfecture&quot;, and &quot;Halle aux Grains&quot; are located), from the medieval lower town. He also paved the way to the construction of the &quot;boulevard Daniel Depuis&quot;, in the West of Blois. Between 1862 and 1865, the Denis-Papin staircase are built under La Morandière&#x27;s supervision, in the axis of Jacques-Gabriel Bridge and Blois-Vienne&#x27;s Wilson Avenue.

In the meantime, the lower town faced three of the most significant floods of the Loire river: in 1846, 1856 (the worst), and 1866. The central districts of St. Jean and Blois-Vienne were under water, as well as La Bouillie spillway.

On 13 December 1871, the Prussian army took control of Blois during the Franco-Prussian War. The city was taken back by Lieutenant Georges de Villebois-Mareuil, General Joseph Pourcet, and General Bertrand de Chabron. Since then, a memorial stands on Wilson Avenue in Vienne.

In 1939, the construction of Blois Basilica was completed. That same year, between 29 January and 8 February, more than 3,100 Spanish refugees came to the Loir-et-Cher department, fleeing the Spanish Civil War and Dictator Francisco Franco. In June 1940, the German bombings destroyed a large part of the centre, and the French destroyed the 10th arch of Jacques-Gabriel Bridge to prevent further advance for the enemy. The German army bombed the former Town Hall on 16 June, thus killing Mayor Émile Laurens in the process, and took over the city 2 days later, on 18 June, the exact same day of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Appeal for Internal Resistance.

Between June and August 1944, US-English-allied bombings destroyed other infrastructures, like the railway bridge between Blois and Romorantin. In total during World War II, 230 people were killed, and 1,522 buildings were entirely or partially destroyed. On 16 August 1944, the German troops withdrew to Blois-Vienne to seek refuge and destroyed the three central arches of the bridge. On 1 September, they surrendered. The bridge was rebuilt and reopened in December 1948.

In 1959, Mayor Marcel Bühler received President Charles de Gaulle and launched the construction of the &quot;ZUP&quot;, at the North of the city, on the same model of so-called &quot;banlieues&quot; of Paris or any other French city.

== Landmarks and tourism ==

Since 1986, Blois is part of the French Towns of Art and History program, which promotes the cultural and historical estate.




=== Château of Blois ===
The Château of Blois, a Renaissance multi-style château once occupied by King Louis XII, is located in the centre of the city, and an 18th-century stone bridge spans the Loire. It was also the residence of many Counts of Blois, who were amongst the most closest vassals to the King of France between the 9th and the 14th century. Many gardens are located around the château, like:
* the St. Sauveur Garden (&quot;Parterre Saint-Sauveur&quot; in French);
* the Lily Garden (&quot;Jardin des Lices&quot;);
* the King&#x27;s Stronghold (&quot;Bastion du Roi&quot;), and;
* Victor Hugo Square (&quot;Square Victor Hugo&quot;).

=== House of Magic ===
Right in front of the château, &quot;La Maison de la Magie Robert-Houdin&quot; (i.e.: Robert-Houdin House of Magic) is a museum dedicated to illusionism. This is the only public museum in Europe which incorporates in one place collections of magic and a site for permanent performing arts, and directly reflects the personality of Robert-Houdin.

=== Louis-XII Place and Fountains ===

Opened after bombings in 1944, the place stands right below the château, closest to the Loire river, and is actually located at the center of Blois downtown. There are local shops and restaurants, and a 16th-century fountain stands below the Sycamores planted in the place. Known as Louis XII Fountain (&quot;Fontaine Louis XII&quot;), this is one of the greatest and oldest water inlets throughout the city, but far from being the only one. Among the other founts, there are:
* St. Martin Fountain (&quot;Fontaine Saint-Martin&quot;), below the staircase between the château and Louis XII Place;
* St. Nicholas Fountain (&quot;Fontaine Saint-Nicolas&quot;), within the St. Nicholas Church;
* Elected Representatives&#x27; Fountain (&quot;Fontaine des Élus&quot;), in &quot;rue Foulerie&quot;;
* Ave Maria Fountain (&quot;Fontaine Ave Maria&quot;), in &quot;place Ave Maria&quot;;
* Town hall Fountain (&quot;Fontaine de l&#x27;Hôtel de Ville&quot;), below the Denis Papin staircase (where was the former Town Hall before World War II);
* St. Jack Fountain (&quot;Fontaine Saint-Jacques&quot;), in &quot;rue Denis Papin&quot;;
* Corbigny Fountain (&quot;Fontaine de Corbigny&quot;), in Victor Hugo Square ;
* Simple Fountain (&quot;Fontaine des Simples&quot;), in the Lily Garden, in remembrance of a monumental Versailles-style fountain lost after WWII bombings.

=== Comics Museum ===
Blois is also the location of so-called &quot;Maison de la BD&quot;, a museum devoted to the art of comic books. Since the 1980s, this museum hosts an annual comic festival in late November called &quot;BD Boum&quot;, described as &quot;the leading free comic book festival in France&quot;.

=== Former Hôtel-Dieu ===

Already by 924, monks from the St. Lomer community were given some acres below the medieval castle, but outside the city walls, on the bank of the Loire river. In the 13th century, a proper church was built, then fortified because of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. St. Lomer Abbey was completely destroyed during the French Wars of Religion. The edifice was rebuilt until the early 18th century. When the French Revolution broke out by 1789, the church was turnt into a Hôtel-Dieu, namely a charity hospital for the have-nots, because Revolutionners destroyed many clergy- and royal-related monuments. After that, new buildings were added to the original St. Lomer Abbey, which became St. Nicholas Church, and the additional edifices remained dedicated to the Hôtel-Dieu of the city. Nonetheless, this part was gradually abandoned and taken back by some public services. A reconversion project is currently under study.

=== Former Poulain Chocolate Factory ===

In the late 19th century, Bloisian industrialist and chocolatier Victor-Auguste Poulain established his brand&#x27;s factory next to Blois station. The premises moved in the 1980s. Nowadays, those are housings and host the National Institute and School of Applied Sciences (&quot;INSA&quot;).

=== Denis-Papin Staircase ===

As Blois is built on a pair of steep hills, winding and steep pathways run through the city, culminating in long staircases at various points. The most iconic of them is the monumental Denis-Papin staircase which overlooks the town, provides a panoramic view by overlooking the downtown and the Loire Valley, and regularly enlivens urban space with original decorations. The fountain next to the staircase is a reminder of the location of the first Town Hall, destroyed after bombings on 16 June 1940.

=== Town Hall and Bishopric Gardens ===

Blois achieved independence from the Diocese of Chartres in 1697, and the cathedral was completed by 1700. As a result, the first bishops engineered wide gardens on several levels, next to the premises. Since the destruction of the former Blois town hall during World War II, local authorities requisitioned the bishop&#x27;s apartments to establish there the new town hall. Now organised as an urban park, the gardens offer a panoramic view on the downtown, the Loire river, and Blois-Vienne. A statue of Joan of Arc, given to the city by American patron J. Sanford Saltus, stands in the middle of the park. Bishopric gardens are open to public all the year, and a remarkable rose garden can be visited from 15 May and 30 September, each year.

=== Hôtels Particuliers and Timber Framing Houses ===

Since Count Louis II of Orléans became King Louis XII of France in 1498, the city started to host many noblepersons from all the Kingdom. All would build their own mansion as close from the château as they could. King Louis XII also imported Renaissance style from Italy due to his successful military campaigns there. Among these so-called &quot;hôtels particuliers&quot;, there are:
* the &quot;Hôtel d&#x27;Alluye&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel d&#x27;Amboise&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel de Belot&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel de la Capitainerie&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Hôtel de Bretagne&quot;);
* the &quot;Hôtel de la Chancellerie&quot; (i.e.: Chancellery Hotel);
* the &quot;Hôtel Denis-Dupont&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel d&#x27;Épernon&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel de Guise&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel de Jassaud&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel de Lavallière&quot;, built for Louise de Lavallière;
* the &quot;Hôtel de Rochefort&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel Sardini&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel Viart&quot;;
* the &quot;Hôtel de Villebresme&quot;, in which Denis Papin lived;
* the &quot;Château de la Vicomté&quot; (i.e.: &quot;Château of Viscounty&quot;), in the hamlet of &quot;Les Grouëts&quot;.

In addition, many citizens from the peoples engineered timber-framing buildings all across the city, including:
* the &quot;Logis du Loup&quot;;
* the &quot;Maison des Acrobates&quot;.

Please note all the above edifices have been listed as historical monuments.

=== Blois-Vienne and the Loire river ===

&quot;Blois-Vienne&quot; (or merely &quot;Vienne&quot;) is the name given to the southern part of the city, on the left bank of the Loire river. Independent from the city until 1606, there are many traces of the river&#x27;s past. The main link between both banks is the Jacques-Gabriel Bridge, built in the early 18th century. From the levees circling the surroundings to other abandoned bridges, Vienne has also conserved a harbour, named &quot;La Creusille&quot;, which is now an urban park right on &quot;La Loire à Vélo&quot; bike route. Beyond the levees, &quot;La Bouillie&quot; Park is getting rehabilitated, and actually is a spillway in the event of floodings. Further to the south of the city, the &quot;Forêt de Russy&quot; is a reminder of the thick woods that once covered the area.

=== Religious Buildings ===

The city also is provided with many religious edifices, including:
* Blois Cathedral, dedicated to both Kings Louis IX and Louis XII, built between 1564 and 1700.
* St. Vincent Blois Church, dedicated to Saint Vincent de Paul, built between 1625 and 1660.
* St. Nicholas Blois Church, dedicated to bishop Saint Nicholas of Myra, built in the 12th century.
* Blois-Vienne Church, dedicated to Saint Saturnin of Toulouse, built between c. 1500 and 1528.
* The Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Trinité, dedicated to Our Lady of the Holy Trinity, built between 1932 and 1939.

==Climate==

==Transport==
The A10 motorway connects Blois with Paris, Orléans and Tours. Blois Railway Station offers direct connections from Paris, Orléans, Tours, Nantes, and to several regional destinations.

<text>Peter Michael Ainsworth (16 November 1956 – 6 April 2021) was a British Conservative politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for East Surrey from 1992 to 2010.

Following his retirement from politics, Ainsworth was appointed UK chair of the Big Lottery Fund and, later, chairman of the Churches Conservation Trust.

== Early life ==
Ainsworth was the son of a naval officer, the lieutenant commander Michael Lionel Yeoward Ainsworth , and Patricia Mary Ainsworth (née Bedford, later Beeny). He was educated at the Ludgrove School in Wokingham, at Bradfield College in Berkshire, and Lincoln College, Oxford, from which he graduated in 1979 with an MA in English Literature and Language.

On leaving university, he became a researcher to the former Conservative Member of the European Parliament, Sir Jack Stewart-Clark, and then in 1981 became a merchant banker. He worked as an investments analyst for Laing &amp; Cruickshank Investment Management (bought by UBS in 2004) from 1981 to 1985, and then in corporate finance for S.G. Warburg Securities (bought by UBS in 1994) from 1985 to 1992, where he became a director from 1990 to 1992.

== Political career ==
From 1984 to 1986, Ainsworth was a Member of the Council at the Bow Group, a conservative think tank. He was elected as a councillor to the London Borough of Wandsworth in 1986, and at the 1992 general election, was elected to Parliament for the safe Conservative seat of East Surrey, succeeding Geoffrey Howe. He remained a Wandsworth councillor until 1994.

In 1994, Ainsworth became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken, and in 1995 became PPS to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, Virginia Bottomley. He was promoted by John Major in 1996 to the Whips&#x27; Office. When the Major government fell the following year, he remained a whip in opposition and was promoted to Deputy Chief Whip by William Hague.

On 5 January 2010, Ainsworth announced that he was to stand down at the forthcoming general election. The Conservative majority in East Surrey was 15,921 in 2005.

=== Shadow Cabinet ===
In 1998, following his party&#x27;s general election defeat the previous year, he entered the Shadow Cabinet, shadowing the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and, from 2001, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Ainsworth resigned from Iain Duncan Smith&#x27;s frontbench for family reasons in 2002.

From 2003 he chaired the Environmental Audit Select Committee before rejoining the Shadow Cabinet under the party&#x27;s new leader David Cameron in December 2005 as Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The post had heightened importance given the Conservatives&#x27; new emphasis on environmental policies under Cameron&#x27;s leadership.

Speaking in March 2006, Ainsworth set out the possible new direction for Conservative policy, stating that &quot;Achieving a sustainable world and combating the threat of climate change will require some really fresh ideas and radical thinking. We cannot expect to meet the challenges of this century by toying with the structures and technologies we have inherited from the past, and the concept of decentralised energy should be taken seriously.&quot; Ainsworth was notable as the only member of the Shadow Cabinet to have voted against the war in Iraq.

Ainsworth lost his position in the Shadow Cabinet in the January 2009 reshuffle when Nick Herbert took the post of Shadow Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. From 2009 to 2010, Ainsworth was chairman of the Conservative Arts and Creative Industries Network, and from 2010 to 2012, he was chairman of the Conservative Environment Network.

== Outside Parliament ==
Ainsworth&#x27;s interest in classical music and the environment was reflected in several of his roles outside politics. In 2000, he presented the six-part series &quot;Discord, Music and Dissent&quot;, about &quot;conscience and musical creativity&quot; on BBC Radio 4. In 2005, Ainsworth became chairman of the Elgar Foundation, a role he held until 2013.

He was a Founder Partner of the Robertsbridge Group, a sustainability consultancy, in 2010, and from 2013 to 2016, he was a trustee of the Elgar Foundation. In June 2011, following his departure from Parliament, Ainsworth was appointed chairman of the Big Lottery Fund. Ainsworth was a board member of the Environment Agency from 2012 to 2018, and from 2014 to 2016, he was a member of the London Sustainable Development Commission. He was also chairman of the Churches Conservation Trust from 2016 until he died in 2021. In 2019, he became chairman of the Heritage Alliance.

He was a Member of the Board for the wild-plant charity Plantlife from 2003 onwards, becoming chairman from 2010 to 2015. He was also a member of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, Friends of the Earth and the Surrey Wildlife Trust. Ainsworth was vice-president of the Arthur Bliss Society and a Surrey Campaign to Protect Rural England trustee from 2010 to 2011. Ainsworth was made an honorary fellow of the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management in 2010 and the Society for the Environment in 2013.

== Personal life ==
Ainsworth married Claire Alison Burnett in Hatfield in 1981, with whom he had a son, Benny Ainsworth, who became an actor, and two daughters.

According to &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, he listed his recreations as &quot;music, &quot;. He was a member of the Marylebone Cricket Club and the Garrick Club. Ainsworth died in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, of a heart attack, on 6 April 2021, aged 64.

<doc id="93467" wikidata="Q1142183" url="?curid=93467" title="User space and kernel space">
<text>A modern computer operating system usually uses virtual memory to provide separate address spaces or separate regions of a single address space, called user space and kernel space. Primarily, this separation serves to provide memory protection and hardware protection from malicious or errant software behaviour.
Kernel space is strictly reserved for running a privileged operating system kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers. In contrast, user space is the memory area where application software and some drivers execute, typically one address space per process.

== Overview ==
The term user space (or userland) refers to all code that runs outside the operating system&#x27;s kernel. User space usually refers to the various programs and libraries that the operating system uses to interact with the kernel: software that performs input/output, manipulates file system objects, application software, etc.

Each user space process normally runs in its own virtual memory space, and, unless explicitly allowed, cannot access the memory of other processes. This is the basis for memory protection in today&#x27;s mainstream operating systems, and a building block for privilege separation. A separate user mode can also be used to build efficient virtual machines – see Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements. With enough privileges, processes can request the kernel to map part of another process&#x27;s memory space to its own, as is the case for debuggers. Programs can also request shared memory regions with other processes, although other techniques are also available to allow inter-process communication.


== Implementation ==
The most common way of implementing a user mode separate from kernel mode involves operating system protection rings.
Protection rings, in turn, are implemented using CPU modes.
Typically, kernel space programs run in kernel mode, also called supervisor mode;
normal applications in user space run in user mode.

Some operating systems are single address space operating systems—they have a single address space for all user-mode code. (The kernel-mode code may be in the same address space, or it may be in a second address space).
Other operating systems have a per-process address space, with a separate address space for each user-mode process.

Another approach taken in experimental operating systems is to have a single address space for all software, and rely on a programming language&#x27;s semantics to make sure that arbitrary memory cannot be accessed – applications cannot acquire any references to the objects that they are not allowed to access. This approach has been implemented in JXOS, Unununium as well as Microsoft&#x27;s Singularity research project.

<text>Charlotte Jean Scott Atkins (born 24 September 1950) is a British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Staffordshire Moorlands from 1997 until 2010.

==Early life==
Atkins is the daughter of Ron Atkins, the left wing former Labour MP for Preston North, and the longest-lived British MP ever. Atkins was educated at the Colchester County High School, and is a graduate of the London School of Economics, gaining a BSc in Economics. From the University of London, she also gained an MA in Area Studies. She worked as a community relations officer with the Luton Community Research Council from 1974 to 1976, before joining the trade union movement.

For four years she was a researcher with the UCATT union (from 1976 to 1980), then a researcher from 1980 to 1984 for the TASS and AUEW, before becoming a press officer for UNISON and COHSE from 1984 to 1987.

Atkins joined the Labour Party in 1965. In 1982, she was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Wandsworth, and was the Deputy Leader of the Labour Group from 1983 to 1986. In 1981 she wrote a book with Chris Mullin entitled &quot;How to Select or Reselect Your MP&quot;.

==Parliamentary career==
In 1990, Atkins unsuccessfully contested the Eastbourne by-election caused by the assassination of the Conservative MP Ian Gow by the Provisional IRA. She entered the House of Commons at the 1997 general election in the Labour landslide as the Member of Parliament for Staffordshire Moorlands, a seat held previously by the retiring David Knox and which had been Conservative-held for 27 years.

After the 2001 general election, Atkins was appointed a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. She was promoted to Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department for Transport in 2004, but was dropped after the 2005 general election. In July 2005 she became a member of the Health Select Committee.

Atkins was largely loyal to the Labour government during her time in Parliament and rarely rebelled.

Atkins was vice-chair of the All-Party Hill Farmers Group, and took part in a series of adjournment debates on government funding for inland waterways. She is a volunteer for the Manchester-based British Fluoridisation Society.

Atkins lost her seat at the 2010 general election to Karen Bradley of the Conservative Party.

==Post-parliamentary career==
In March 2012, Atkins was appointed as the chair of the Central Shires Canal and River Trust Partnership Board. The CRT is the charity which has taken over the work and role of British Waterways. She was heavily involved in campaigning for more funds and the regeneration of England&#x27;s waterways while in Parliament, and won the first ever Inland Waterways Association Parliamentarian of the Year Award in 2008.

Atkins was elected as a councillor for the Leek North ward of Staffordshire Moorlands District Council in a 2012 by-election, and continues to represent the ward.

==Personal life==
She married Gus Brain in June 1990 in Bromley and has one child, Emma, born in October 1986.

Her twin sister, Liz, is a Lambeth Councillor.

<text>The World Boxing Association (WBA), formerly known as the National Boxing Association (NBA), is the oldest and one of four major organizations which sanction professional boxing bouts, alongside the World Boxing Council (WBC), International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO). The WBA awards its world championship title at the professional level. Founded in the United States in 1921 by 13 state representatives as the NBA, in 1962 it changed its name in recognition of boxing&#x27;s growing popularity worldwide and began to gain other nations as members.

By 1975, a majority of votes were held by Latin American nations and the organization headquarters had moved to Panama. After being located during the 1990s and early 2000s in Venezuela, the organization offices returned to Panama in 2007.

As of August of 2024, boxing website BoxRec no longer recognizes WBA world title fights or world champions.

==History==
The World Boxing Association can be traced back to the original National Boxing Association, organized in 1921. The first bout it recognized was the Jack Dempsey–Georges Carpentier heavyweight championship bout in New Jersey.

The NBA was formed by representatives from 13 American states, including Sam Milner, to counterbalance the influence that the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) wielded. The NBA and the NYSAC sometimes crowned different &quot;world champions&quot; in the same division, leading to confusion about who was the real champion.

The International Boxing Research Organization describes the early NBA as follows:

Originally more comparable to the present American Association of Boxing Commissions than to its offspring and successor, the NBA sanctioned title bouts, published lists of outstanding challengers, withdrew titular recognition, but did not attempt to appoint its own title bout officials or otherwise impose its will on championship fights. It also did not conduct purse bids or collect &quot;sanctioning fees.&quot;

The NBA officially became the WBA on 23 August 1962. Gilberto Mendoza was the President of the WBA from 1982 until his death in 2016, after which Gilberto Mendoza Jr. took over as president. In the 1990s, the WBA moved its central offices from Panama City, Panama, to Caracas, Venezuela. In January 2007, it returned its offices to Panama.

==Controversies==
As has been the case with all major boxing sanctioning organizations, the WBA has been plagued with charges of corrupt practices. In a 1981 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article, a boxing judge claimed he was influenced by WBA President Gilberto Mendoza to judge certain fighters competing for their titles more favorably. The same article also discussed a variety of bribes paid to WBA officials to obtain championship bout opportunities, or higher placement within the organization&#x27;s rankings. In a 1982 interview, boxing promoter Bob Arum claimed that he had to pay off WBA officials to obtain rankings for his fighters. Further support for allegations of this nature came in the 1980s and 1990s as two other organizations would have similar corruption exposed, including the conviction and imprisonment of IBF President Bob Lee and Graciano Rocchigiani&#x27;s successful civil prosecution of the WBC that resulted in the organization briefly filing for bankruptcy before reaching a settlement that saved it from collapse.

===Fragmented championships===
Until the autumn of 2021, the WBA recognized up to four world champions in any given weight division, to the point of rendering it technically impossible under certain conditions for a WBA world champion to even hold sole recognition from the organization as its champion in a division.

The most prominent designation is that of the WBA Super champion, which was created in 2000 following a suggestion by Lennox Lewis after he was forced to relinquish his WBA heavyweight title prior to his defense against Michael Grant. This distinction was initially reserved for WBA champions who are simultaneously recognized by the WBC, IBF or WBO. A WBA Super champion is afforded special consideration by the organization with respect to meeting mandatory defense obligations to maintain championship recognition, but it also has opened the door for the organization to recognize a separate world champion, commonly referred to as the Regular champion; creating confusion among fans as to who holds the de facto championship title. Some world champions have been upgraded to WBA Super champion status without winning another organization&#x27;s title, among them Floyd Mayweather Jr., Chris John, Anselmo Moreno and Manny Pacquiao; or upon defending their WBA title five or more times. Upon awarding a WBA Super championship, the regular world champion status is deemed vacant, whereupon it is filled by the organization as a separate championship. On March 5, 2021, Claressa Shields became the inaugural WBA Super women&#x27;s champion at light middleweight.

The WBA further complicated this from time to time by recognizing an interim champion, ostensibly in cases where a designated world champion is, for some reason, prohibited from making a timely defense of their title. Under such conditions, the interim title holder is to be the next person to compete for one of the full championship titles once the champion is in a position to compete. In practice, however, this actually occurred rarely if ever and in 2019 the organization began awarding the WBA Gold title, for which no provision exists even within the organization&#x27;s own governing documents. In December 2019 for example, they simultaneously recognized a WBA Super champion (Anthony Joshua), WBA champion (Manuel Charr), WBA interim champion (Trevor Bryan) and WBA Gold champion (Robert Helenius) in the heavyweight division.

There have even been instances where different WBA World Champions have defended versions of the same title, in the same weight class, on the same date, and even within the same event. On September 14, 2024 for example, Caleb Plant defeated Trevor McCumby to earn recognition as the WBA&#x27;s Interim World Super Middleweight championship in an event that was headlined by Canelo Alvarez, who defended his WBA Super World Super Middleweight championship against Edgar Berlanga.

Following the controversial decision in the Gabriel Maestre vs. Mykal Fox fight on August 7, 2021, amid immense public pressure, the WBA finally began eliminating all interim titles in the attempt to return to a single champion per weight division. They reverted to issuing interim championships in 2024.

===Boxer rankings===
The organization has further garnered negative attention with respect to its ranking of boxers, in spite of having adopted a complex, documented rating formula in the 2000s. In 2015 for example, Ali Raymi had been rated number six when, in his service as a colonel in the Yemeni armed forces, he was killed. His death did not significantly hinder his rating position in the WBA however, as in a subsequent ranking he had only dropped to number eleven.

==Title reduction plan==

In August 2021, a letter sent by the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) stating that the WBA having multiple titles is &quot;misleading to the public and the boxers&quot;. The ABC also stated that if the WBA fails to do a satisfactory action regarding the issue, they would recommend to its members:

This could result in the WBA being blocked in the U.S. and will heavily impact WBA&#x27;s business.

The WBA in turn responded by declaring all of their &quot;Interim&quot; titles vacant. They then ordered tournaments to determine a single champion of their weight classes.

At minimumweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion Vic Saludar was ordered to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Erick Rosa on 26 August 2021, with Rosa winning the &quot;Regular&quot; title via split decision on 21 December. it was not until 29 September 2022, until the WBA officially ordered Rosa against &quot;Super&quot; champion Knockout CP Freshmart, however, after multiple failed attempts to make the fight, Rosa officially vacated his &quot;Regular&quot; title on 15 January 2024 to move up to light flyweight, leaving CP Freshmart as sole champion.

At light flyweight, &quot;Super&quot; champion Hiroto Kyoguchi and &quot;Regular&quot; champion Esteban Bermudez had already been ordered to fight prior to the ABC letter on 10 June 2021, but complications meant it was not until 28 January 2022 when purse bids were due to be held, however injury to Kyoguchi meant the WBA instead approved the rematch between Bermudez and former regular champion Carlos Cañizales 2 days earlier on 26 January. Bermudez vs Cañizales did not end up happening due to the latter&#x27;s short-lived decision to move up to flyweight, and thus Kyoguchi-Bermudez took place on 10 June, with Kyoguchi winning by TKO. Former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Daniel Matellon was ordered to face Cañizales on September 30 in a final eliminator for the &quot;Super&quot; title, with Cañizales winning via technical decision on 9 June 2023, becoming mandatory to Kenshiro Teraji, who defeated Kyoguchi by TKO on 1 November 2022. Teraji defeated Cañizales via majority decision on 23 January 2024 to become sole champion. 

At flyweight, the removal of &quot;Interim&quot; champions meant Artem Dalakian was left as sole champion of the division. Despite never being upgraded to &quot;Super&quot; champion, Dalakian had been the WBA&#x27;s primary champion since winning the title in 2018, due to the absence of a Super champion since 2015. Dalakian was ordered to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Luis Concepción on 19 August 2021, whom he defeated by TKO on 20 November to remain sole champion.

At super flyweight, &quot;Super&quot; champion Juan Francisco Estrada was ordered to face &quot;Regular&quot; champion Joshua Franco on 9 February, with the fight going to purse bid on 19 April. Despite it being announced on 17 May that the fight would take place on 16 July, Estrada was disowned and stripped by the Championships Committee on 11 August for pursuing a rematch with Román González, leaving Franco as the sole champion of the division.

At bantamweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion Guillermo Rigondeaux was stripped of his title on 14 August 2021, after facing then WBO champion John Riel Casimero. The WBA announced its refusal to sanction the fight on 23 July, in respect of restrictions placed on &quot;Regular&quot; titles by the WBO, and declared Rigondeaux would have to request to be ranked in order to follow through with the fight, in which his &quot;Regular&quot; title would be declared vacant. &quot;Super&quot; champion Naoya Inoue then became sole champion.

At super bantamweight, Brandon Figueroa was stripped of his &quot;Regular&quot; title on 2 December 2021, after facing Stephen Fulton in a WBC and WBO unification on November 27. This was due to restrictions imposed by the WBO who refuse to sanction fights involving the &quot;Regular&quot; title, with the WBA respecting this and announcing on 17 August (before the ABC letter) that Figueroa would be stripped. This came after Figueroa was allowed to &quot;unify&quot; in his previous fight with then WBC champion Luis Nery on 15 May, as the WBC do not impose the same restrictions on the Regular title. This left &quot;Super&quot; champion Murodjohn Akhmadaliev as sole champion. Former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Ra’eese Aleem did not move forward any with WBA sanctioned fight and was subsequently dropped from the initial mandatory position.

At featherweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion Leigh Wood was ordered to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Michael Conlan on 27 August 2021, with Wood winning by KO on 12 March 2022. On 6 April, the WBA ordered the bout between Wood and &quot;Super&quot; champion Léo Santa Cruz. On 19 July, the WBA rejected a request from Santa Cruz to unify with WBC champion Rey Vargas, insisting he had to fight Wood, which Santa Cruz accepted 2 days later on 21 July. On 12 August, it was announced that Santa Cruz and Wood had reached an agreement, and thus purse bids were canceled. On 24 August, the WBA announced they had approved the previously rejected unification between Santa Cruz and Vargas, as well as a title defense for Wood against Mauricio Lara, with the winners set to fight each other. Wood, who was due to fight Lara on 24 September, pulled out with an injury on 19 September, and on 30 September the WBA ruled Wood must face Santa Cruz in his comeback fight, and refused to grant any additional exceptions. Purse bids were scheduled for 12 December, however did not take place due to Santa Cruz relinquishing his &quot;Super&quot; title and leaving Wood as the sole champion of the division.

At super featherweight, Gervonta Davis vacated his &quot;Super&quot; title on 28 August 2021, leaving then &quot;Regular&quot; champion Roger Gutiérrez as the sole champion. Gutiérrez had been ordered to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Chris Colbert on 15 August, but following Gutierrez&#x27;s withdrawal, replacement Héctor Garcia defeated Colbert via unanimous decision to become mandatory challenger on 26 February 2022. The WBA thus ordered Gutiérrez vs Garcia on 27 June, with Garcia winning a unanimous decision victory to become champion on 20 August 2022.

At lightweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion Gervonta Davis was due to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Rolando Romero on 5 December 2021, but following withdrawal from Romero instead faced Isaac Cruz, winning by unanimous decision. The WBA then formally ordered Davis Vs Romero on 24 January 2022, with Davis winning via TKO on 28 May to retain the &quot;Regular&quot; title. On 30 November 2023, &quot;Super&quot; champion Devin Haney relinquished his title ahead of his clash against WBC super-lightweight champion Regis Prograis, thus leaving Davis as sole champion.

At super lightweight, Gervonta Davis vacated his &quot;Regular&quot; title on 8 December 2021, leaving then &quot;Super&quot; champion Josh Taylor as sole champion. Taylor was then ordered to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Alberto Puello on 9 March 2022, but was stripped on 14 May for failing to sign the contract. Puello was then ordered to face Batyr Akhmedov on 12 June following a panel to determine the next challenger, with Puello winning via split decision on 20 August to become champion. The &quot;Interim&quot; title was contested by Ohara Davies and Ismael Barroso on 6 January 2024, following an injury sustained to champion Rolando Romero. While it was expected that Romero would face the winner as soon as he was able, he instead defended his title against Isaac Cruz on 30 March, losing via TKO. 

At welterweight, the WBA ordered a 4-man box off on 16 September 2021, consisting of &quot;Super&quot; champion Yordenis Ugas against Eimantas Stanionis and &quot;Regular&quot; champion Jamal James against Radzhab Butaev, with the winners set to face each other to determine one champion. On 20 October, the WBA initially rejected permission from Ugas to unify with WBC and IBF champion Errol Spence Jr., while Butaev defeated James via TKO on 30 October to become &quot;Regular&quot; champion. On 8 February 2022 it was announced that Ugas and Spence Jr. would indeed unify on 16 April, followed by the announcement of Butaev vs Stanionis on the undercard on 21 February. Stanionis would go on to defeat Butaev via split decision to become &quot;Regular&quot; champion, while Spence Jr. defeated Ugas via TKO to become &quot;Super&quot; champion. Following this on 21 November, the WBA granted special permission for Spence Jr. to defend his titles against former unified champion Keith Thurman, while Stanionis was instead ordered to face Vergil Ortiz Jr., with the winners set to meet. However, an undisputed title fight between Spence and WBO champion Terence Crawford was announced on 25 May 2023, taking place on 29 July, with Crawford winning via TKO. Stanionis Vs Ortiz Jr. was scheduled to take place on 8 July following a delay from 29 April, but was again called off following medical issues with Ortiz Jr. Stanionis instead faced former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Gabriel Maestre, who was not included in the WBA&#x27;s initial box off despite being the final &quot;Interim&quot; champion before the ABC Letter. Stanionis defeated Maestre via UD on 4 May 2024. On 31 August, Terence Crawford vacated his welterweight WBA &quot;Super&quot; title after winning the WBA super welterweight title on 3 August, leaving Stanionis as the sole champion. 

At super welterweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion Erislandy Lara was forced to vacate on 31 August 2021, leaving &quot;Super&quot; champion Jermell Charlo as sole champion.

At middleweight, &quot;Super&quot; champion Gennady Golovkin was ordered to face Regular champion Erislandy Lara on 23 September 2022. On 9 March 2023, it was announced that Golovkin had vacated the &quot;Super&quot; title, leaving Lara as sole champion. Former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Chris Eubank Jr. did not move forward with any WBA sanctioned fight and was thus dropped from the initial mandatory position.

At super middleweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion David Morrell opted to vacate his title on 31 August 2024 after winning the vacant &quot;Regular&quot; title at light heavyweight on 3 August, after the WBA stated he could only hold one belt. This left &quot;Super&quot; champion Canelo Alvarez as sole champion.

At light heavyweight, the removal of &quot;Interim&quot; champions meant &quot;Super&quot; champion Dmitry Bivol became sole champion. Former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Robin Krasniqi lost in a rematch to Dominic Boesel on 10 October 2021, with Boesel becoming #1 challenger for Bivol. Boesel fought #2 ranked Gilberto Ramirez in a final eliminator to determine the mandatory challenger on 14 May 2022, with Ramirez winning by knockout. Bivol Vs Ramirez was then ordered on 11 July, with Bivol winning via unanimous decision on 5 November.

At cruiserweight, &quot;Super&quot; champion Arsen Goulamirian and &quot;Regular&quot; champion Ryad Merhy had been ordered to fight on 19 July 2022 (a rematch of their 2018 &quot;Interim&quot; title fight). Merhy instead pursued a fight with WBC champion Illunga Makabu, however, after concerns with making the cruiserweight limit, Makabu vs Merhy was called off on 8 August, and Merhy sent a formal letter to the WBA vacating his title 4 days later on 12 August, leaving Goulamirian as the sole champion.

At heavyweight, &quot;Regular&quot; champion Trevor Bryan was ordered to face former &quot;Interim&quot; champion Daniel Dubois on 31 January 2022, with Dubois winning via KO on 11 June. Following this, Dubois was ordered to face &quot;Super&quot; champion Oleksandr Usyk on 12 December, with the fight taking place on 26 August 2023, where Usyk won via KO to become sole champion. 

In January 2024, the WBA once again began to sanction fights for the &quot;Interim&quot; title in weight divisions which already had a sole WBA champion. Only 1 fight has been sanctioned for a new &quot;Regular&quot; champion, between reigning super middleweight &quot;Regular&quot; champion David Morrell vs Radivoje Kalajdzic. Morrell defeated Kalajdzic on 3 August before vacating his super middleweight Regular title to remain at light heavyweight. As of August 2024, super flyweight, super featherweight, super lightweight, super welterweight, light heavyweight, and heavyweight have multiple WBA champions despite having achieved sole champion status following the ABC letter. 

Light flyweight, super flyweight, bantamweight, featherweight, super featherweight, lightweight, super lightweight, welterweight, super welterweight, middleweight, and cruiserweight now no longer have a WBA &quot;Super&quot; champion as a &quot;Super&quot; champion vacating has led to either the &quot;Interim&quot;/&quot;Regular&quot; champion becoming full World champion or a fight being sanctioned for the World title without &quot;Super&quot; status. Minimumweight, super bantamweight, super middleweight, light heavyweight, and heavyweight all still have a designated &quot;Super&quot; champion as the &quot;Super&quot; title is only made defunct if the champion vacates.

==&quot;Man of Triumph&quot; belts==
Since 2015, the WBA awards a customized version of their WBA Super champion belt to big fights involving a WBA championship. The WBA called this the &quot;Man of Triumph&quot; belt, named after the trophy awarded to the winner of the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao fight. The plate of the belt has the images of the two boxers fighting. Floyd Mayweather Jr. received the first gold-plated version of the belt while Manny Pacquiao was awarded a one-time rhodium-plated version. Other recipients of the custom gold-plated belt are Anthony Joshua, Vasyl Lomachenko, Manny Pacquiao, Oleksandr Usyk, Canelo Álvarez and Callum Smith.

==Cooperation with IBA==
The WBA signed a cooperation agreement with the Russian-led amateur governing body International Boxing Association in 2022. The WBA also reinstated Russian and Belarusian boxers to its rankings after they were initially removed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

<text>A web service (WS) is either:
* a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet, or
* a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, images).

In a web service, a web technology such as HTTP is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as XML and JSON.

In practice, a web service commonly provides an object-oriented web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end-user. Many organizations that provide data in formatted HTML pages will also provide that data on their server as XML or JSON, often through a Web service to allow syndication. Another application offered to the end-user may be a mashup, where a Web server consumes several Web services at different machines and compiles the content into one user interface.

==Web services (generic)==
===Asynchronous JavaScript and XML===
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is a dominant technology for Web services. Developing from the combination of HTTP servers, JavaScript clients and Plain Old XML (as distinct from SOAP and W3C Web Services), now it is frequently used with JSON as well as, or instead of, XML.

===REST===

Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architecture for well-behaved Web services that can function at Internet scale.

In a 2004 document, the W3C sets following REST as a key distinguishing feature of Web services:
===Technologies and protocols related to web services using markup languages===
There are a number of Web services that use markup languages:
* JSON-RPC.
* JSON-WSP
* Representational state transfer (REST) versus remote procedure call (RPC)
* Simple Object Access Protocol
* Web Services Conversation Language (WSCL)
* Web Services Description Language (WSDL), developed by the W3C
* Web Services Flow Language (WSFL), superseded by BPEL
* Web template
* WS-MetadataExchange
* XML Interface for Network Services (XINS), provides a POX-style web service specification format

===Web API===

A Web API is a development in Web services where emphasis has been moving to simpler representational state transfer (REST) based communications. Restful APIs do not require XML-based Web service protocols (SOAP and WSDL) to support their interfaces.

==W3C Web services==
In relation to W3C Web services, the W3C defined a Web service as:
W3C Web Services may use SOAP over HTTP protocol, allowing less costly (more efficient) interactions over the Internet than via proprietary solutions like EDI/B2B. Besides SOAP over HTTP, Web services can also be implemented on other reliable transport mechanisms like FTP. In a 2002 document, the Web Services Architecture Working Group defined a Web services architecture, requiring a standardized implementation of a &quot;Web service.&quot;

===Explanation===
The term &quot;Web service&quot; describes a standardized way of integrating Web-based applications using the XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI open standards over an Internet Protocol backbone. XML is the data format used to contain the data and provide metadata around it, SOAP is used to transfer the data, WSDL is used for describing the services available and UDDI lists what services are available.

A Web service is a method of communication between two electronic devices over a network. It is a software function provided at a network address over the Web with the service &quot;always-on&quot; as in the concept of utility computing.

Many organizations use multiple software systems for management. Different software systems often need to exchange data with each other, and a Web service is a method of communication that allows two software systems to exchange this data over the Internet. The software system that requests data is called a &quot;service requester&quot;, whereas the software system that would process the request and provide the data is called a &quot;service provider&quot;.

Different software may use different programming languages, and hence there is a need for a method of data exchange that doesn&#x27;t depend upon a particular programming language. Most types of software can, however, interpret XML tags. Thus, Web services can use XML files for data exchange.

Rules for communication with different systems need to be defined, such as:
* How one system can request data from another system.
* Which specific parameters are needed in the data request.
* What would be the structure of the data produced. (Normally, data is exchanged in XML files, and the structure of the XML file is validated against a .xsd file.)
* What error messages to display when a certain rule for communication is not observed, to make troubleshooting easier.

All of these rules for communication are defined in a file called WSDL (Web Services Description Language), which has a codice_1 extension. (Proposals for Autonomous Web Services (AWS) seek to develop more flexible Web services that do not rely on strict rules.)

A directory called UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) defines which software system should be contacted for which type of data. So when one software system needs one particular report/data, it would go to the UDDI and find out which other systems it can contact for receiving that data. Once the software system finds out which other systems it should contact, it would then contact that system using a special protocol called SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol). The service provider system would first validate the data request by referring to the WSDL file, and then process the request and send the data under the SOAP protocol.

===Automated design methods===
Automated tools can aid in the creation of a Web service. For services using WSDL, it is possible to either automatically generate WSDL for existing classes (a bottom-up model) or to generate a class skeleton given existing WSDL (a top-down model).
* A developer using a bottom-up model writes implementing classes first (in some programming language) and then uses a WSDL generating tool to expose methods from these classes as a Web service. This is simpler to develop but may be harder to maintain if the original classes are subject to frequent change.
* A developer using a top-down model writes the WSDL document first and then uses a code generating tool to produce the class skeleton, to be completed as necessary. This model is generally considered more difficult but can produce cleaner designs and is generally more resistant to change. As long as the message formats between the sender and receiver do not change, changes in the sender and receiver themselves do not affect the Web service. The technique is also referred to as &quot;contract first&quot; since the WSDL (or contract between sender and receiver) is the starting point.
* A developer using a Subset WSDL (SWSDL) (i.e. a WSDL with the subset operation in the original WSDL) can perform Web service testing and top-down development.

===Criticism===

Critics of non-RESTful Web services often complain that they are too complex and based upon large software vendors or integrators, rather than typical open source implementations.

There are also concerns about performance due to Web services&#x27; use of XML as a message format and SOAP/HTTP in enveloping and transporting.

===Regression testing of Web services===
Functional and non-functional testing of Web services is done with the help of WSDL parsing. Regression testing is performed by identifying the changes made to upgrade software. Web service regression testing needs can be categorized in three different ways, namely, changes in WSDL, changes in the code, and selective re-testing of operations. We can capture the above three needs in three intermediate forms of Subset WSDL, namely, Difference WSDL (DWSDL), Unit WSDL (UWSDL), and Reduced WSDL (RWSDL), respectively. These three Subset WSDLs are then combined to form Combined WSDL (CWSDL) that is further used for regression testing of the Web service. This will help in Automated Web Service Change Management (AWSCM), by performing the selection of the relevant test cases to construct a reduced test suite from the old test suite.
Web services testing can also be automated using several test automation tools like SoapUI, Oracle Application Testing Suite (OATS), Unified Functional Testing, Selenium, etc.

===Web service change management===
Work-related to the capture and visualization of changes made to a Web service. Visualization and computation of changes can be done in the form of intermediate artifacts (Subset WSDL). The insight on the computation of change impact is helpful in testing, top-down development and reduce regression testing. AWSCM is a tool that can identify subset operations in a WSDL file to construct a subset WSDL.

=== Discovering and Searching for Web Services ===
While UDDI was intended to serve as a service directory and become the means to discovering web services, many vendors discontinued their UDDI solutions or repositories between 2005-2008, including Microsoft, SAP, IBM, among others. A key study published in WWW2008 Conference (Beijing, China) presented the state of SOAP-based web services and concluded that only 63% of the available SOAP-based web services at the time of the study were actually active or can be invoked. The study also found that search engines were becoming an ideal source for searching for web services compared to that of service registries like the UDDI due its design complexity.

<text>UserLand Software is a US-based software company, founded in 1988, that sells web content management, as well as blogging software packages and services.

==Company history==
Dave Winer founded the company in 1988 after leaving Symantec in the spring of 1988. Jean-Louis Gassée, who resigned in 1990 as chief of Apple&#x27;s product development, came to serve on UserLand&#x27;s board of directors.

==Frontier==
UserLand&#x27;s first product release of April 1989 was UserLand IPC, a developer tool for interprocess communication that was intended to evolve into a cross-platform RPC tool. In January 1992 UserLand released version 1.0 of Frontier, a scripting environment for the Macintosh which included an object database and a scripting language named &quot;UserTalk&quot;. At the time of its original release, Frontier was the only system-level scripting environment for the Macintosh, but Apple was working on its own scripting language, AppleScript, and started bundling it with the System 7 system software. As a consequence, most Macintosh scripting work came to be done in the less powerful, but free, scripting language provided by Apple.

UserLand responded to Applescript by re-positioning Frontier as a Web development environment, distributing the software free of charge with the &quot;Aretha&quot; release of May 1995. In late 1996, Frontier 4.1 had become &quot;an integrated development environment that lends itself to the creation and maintenance of Web sites and management of Web pages sans much busywork,&quot; and by the time Frontier 4.2 was released in January 1997, the software was firmly established in the realms of website management and CGI scripting, allowing users to &quot;taste the power of large-scale database publishing with free software.&quot;

Frontier&#x27;s NewsPage suite came to play a pivotal role in the emergence of blogging through its adoption by Jorn Barger, Chris Gulker, and others in the 1997–98 period.

UserLand launched a Windows version of Frontier 5.0 in January 1998 and began charging for licenses again with the 5.1 release of June 1998.

Frontier subsequently became the kernel for two of UserLand&#x27;s products, Manila and Radio UserLand, as well as Dave Winer&#x27;s OPML Editor, all of which support the UserTalk scripting language.

UserLand eventually placed Frontier under the open source GNU General Public License with the 10.0a1 release of September 28, 2004. Frontier is now maintained by the Frontier Kernel Project.

==Early Web building applications==

Userland developed two pioneering Web building applications, AutoWeb in early 1995 and Clay Basket later that year. Both applications went through a free public beta period, yet neither was ever released in a 1.0 version. In 1996 Clay Basket was abandoned in favor of improved Web publishing functionality built into Frontier.

==Manila==
Launched as part of Frontier 6.1 in November 1999, Manila is a content management system that allows the hosting of web sites and their editing through a browser. Within days of releasing Manila, UserLand set up a free Manila hosting service, EditThisPage.com, which quickly became a popular weblogging service.

==Radio UserLand==
Radio UserLand is a client-side weblog system that hosts blogs on UserLand&#x27;s servers for an annual software license fee. The software includes an RSS aggregator and was one of the first applications to both send and receive audio files as RSS enclosures (see podcasting). UserLand was an early adopter of the RSS syndication method, merging Winer&#x27;s Scripting News XML format with Netscape&#x27;s RSS.

First released as a public beta under the name Pike in March 2000, the software came to be released in synch with Manila version numbering: the initial release of 2001 was named Radio UserLand 7.0 and its only major upgrade in 2002 Radio UserLand 8.0. The software is no longer considered to be under active development.

==XML-based protocols and formats==
UserLand counts among the earliest adopters of XML, with first experiments made in late 1997. The company was involved in the development, specification and implementation of several XML formats and was noted for its commitment to openness.

===XML-RPC===
Created in 1998 by UserLand Software and Microsoft, XML-RPC is a remote procedure call protocol that uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism.

UserLand first included a stable XML-RPC framework with its 5.1.3 release of Frontier in August 1998 and subsequently made extensive use of XML-RPC in its Frontier-based products, Manila and Radio UserLand. XML-RPC is also used in the MetaWeblog API.

===SOAP===
SOAP evolved from XML-RPC and was designed as an object-access protocol by Dave Winer, Don Box, Bob Atkinson, and Mohsen Al-Ghosein in 1998, with backing from Microsoft, where Atkinson and Al-Ghosein worked at the time.

SOAP 1.1 was submitted to the W3C by Microsoft, IBM, and UserLand, amongst others, on May 9, 2000. Version 1.2 of the proposed standard became a W3C recommendation on June 24, 2003.

===RSS===
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a family of Web feed formats used to publish frequently updated works—such as blog entries, news headlines, audio, and video—in a standardized format. An RSS document (which is called a &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;web feed&quot;, or &quot;channel&quot;) includes full or summarized text, plus metadata such as publishing dates and authorship.

Between 1999 and 2003, UserLand contributed various versions of the RSS specification. For an overview of the process see the History of web syndication technology.

Using RSS, UserLand also ran one of the first Web aggregators, My.UserLand.Com, which allowed users to follow numerous weblogs from a single web page.

Userland&#x27;s RSS advocacy led them to develop RSS feeds for the New York Times company. The original feeds used a variation on standard RSS, and the feeds were only publicized to UserLand Radio bloggers.

===OPML===

Outline Processor Markup Language (OPML) is an XML format for outlines. Originally developed in 2000 as a native file format for Radio UserLand&#x27;s outliner application, it has since been adopted for other uses, the most common being to exchange lists of web feeds between web feed aggregators.

<doc id="93486" wikidata="Q530911" url="?curid=93486" title="Crunchy Frog">
<text>&quot;Crunchy Frog&quot; is the common name for a Monty Python sketch officially titled &quot;Trade Description Act&quot; (sometimes also known as the &quot;Whizzo Chocolate Company&quot; sketch), inspired by the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 in British law. It features two health inspectors interrogating the owner of a sweet shop about the increasingly bizarre ingredients in his confections, including the titular crunchy frog. Written by John Cleese and Graham Chapman, it originally appeared in episode 6 of the first series of &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, and later appeared in several Monty Python stage shows. In the original sketch, Cleese and Chapman play the inspectors, while Terry Jones plays the sweet shop owner. In later versions, the second inspector is played by Terry Gilliam or left out of the sketch entirely.

== The sketch ==
Mr. Milton, the owner of the Whizzo Chocolate Company (Terry Jones) is approached by two members of the Hygiene Squad, Inspector Praline (John Cleese) and Superintendent Parrot (Graham Chapman). The officers confront him about the odd flavours that are used in the &quot;Whizzo Quality Assortment&quot;, and cite inadequate descriptions of his products as a violation of the Trade Descriptions Act. They ask him to explain the confection labelled &quot;Crunchy Frog&quot;. Milton describes it as an entire frog that has been coated with chocolate, using only &quot;the finest baby frogs, dew picked and flown from Iraq, cleansed in finest quality spring water, lightly killed, and then sealed in a succulent Swiss quintuple smooth treble cream milk chocolate envelope and lovingly frosted with glucose.&quot; Circular logic is used to explain why the bones aren&#x27;t taken out: &quot;If we took the bones out, it wouldn&#x27;t be crunchy, would it?&quot; (A baby frog is a tadpole, which has cartilage rather than bones.)

Other questionable items include the &quot;Cherry Fondue&quot;, which is &quot;extremely nasty&quot;, but not worthy of prosecution, &quot;Ram&#x27;s Bladder Cup&quot; (made from &quot;fresh Cornish ram&#x27;s bladder, emptied, steamed, flavoured with sesame seeds whipped into a fondant and garnished with lark&#x27;s vomit&quot;), &quot;Cockroach Cluster&quot;, &quot;Anthrax Ripple&quot;, and &quot;Spring Surprise&quot; (chocolate wrapped around two stainless steel bolts that &quot;spring out and plunge straight through both [of the victim&#x27;s] cheeks&quot;). At the end of the scene Milton is arrested, and the Superintendent, who has been vomiting during the entire conversation (having sampled the Crunchy Frog and some of the others), faces the camera and warns the public to &quot;take more care when buying its sweeties&quot;.

A later sketch in the same episode features a North American Indian, played in stereotypical fashion by Eric Idle, eating a Crunchy Frog and indicating approval.

== Stage and film ==
The film &quot;Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl&quot; also contains a performance of this sketch, with Chapman as the Inspector and Terry Gilliam as his assistant. The assistant is now called Constable Parrot, and while he too periodically leaves the room to fight off his nausea, he remains onstage during his last attack of sickness and vomits into his helmet—which his superior then orders him to put back on his head. (Gilliam filled his mouth with cold beef stew when he ran off stage during the scene.)

The &quot;Monty Python Live (Mostly)&quot; stage show featured a similar performance, with some small changes to the dialogue — e.g., the Ram&#x27;s Bladder Cup sweet is now described as having been garnished with mouse faeces rather than lark&#x27;s vomit - and with Cleese as the Inspector. Jones, who was then in the early stages of frontal lobe dementia, read some of his dialogue from the insert cards in the chocolate box. The televised 20 July 2014 performance includes some fluffs and corpsing, and a moment in which Cleese takes a card from Jones and reads his line for him before announcing &quot;This is me now&quot; and continuing with his own line.

== Other appearances ==
* In &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Big Red Book&quot; there is a page designed as a chocolate box insert, with descriptions of all the sweets in the Whizzo Quality Assortment.
* In J.K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, two kinds of sweets seen eaten by the characters are Chocolate Frogs and Cockroach Clusters.
* In Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s popular MMORPG &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;, Crunchy Frog can be bought as food at the , a travelling carnival.
* The name of the sketch was the inspiration for the name of the Danish indie record label Crunchy Frog Records.

Le Fleix lies on the banks of the Dordogne at a place where the river bends. This is likely the origin of the name &quot;flexus&quot;.

==History==
Le Fleix is famous for the Treaty of Fleix, signed there in 1580.

There were once two castles in Le Fleix, the Old Castle, which was destroyed, and the New Castle built in the 17th century as a residence for Frédéric de Foix. It was sold during the French Revolution, and became a Protestant church in 1805.

==Population==
==Economy==
The harbour is active in the timber and wine trades. The economy, once based on the river, is now primarily viticultural.

==Notable people==
*Andre Morize (1883–1957), French professor

<text>RSS ([[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] Site Summary or Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed that allows users and applications to access updates to websites in a standardized, computer-readable format. Subscribing to RSS feeds can allow a user to keep track of many different websites in a single news aggregator, which constantly monitors sites for new content, removing the need for the user to manually check them. News aggregators (or &quot;RSS readers&quot;) can be built into a browser, installed on a desktop computer, or installed on a mobile device.

Websites usually use RSS feeds to publish frequently updated information, such as blog entries, news headlines, episodes of audio and video series, or for distributing podcasts. An RSS document (called &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;web feed&quot;, or &quot;channel&quot;) includes full or summarized text, and metadata, like publishing date and author&#x27;s name. RSS formats are specified using a generic XML file.

Although RSS formats have evolved from as early as March 1999, it was between 2005 and 2006 when RSS gained widespread use, and the (&quot;&quot;) icon was decided upon by several major web browsers. RSS feed data is presented to users using software called a news aggregator and the passing of content is called web syndication. Users subscribe to feeds either by entering a feed&#x27;s URI into the reader or by clicking on the browser&#x27;s feed icon. The RSS reader checks the user&#x27;s feeds regularly for new information and can automatically download it, if that function is enabled.

== History ==
The RSS formats were preceded by several attempts at web syndication that did not achieve widespread popularity. The basic idea of restructuring information about websites goes back to as early as 1995, when Ramanathan V. Guha and others in Apple&#x27;s Advanced Technology Group developed the Meta Content Framework.

RDF Site Summary, the first version of RSS, was created by Dan Libby, Ramanathan V. Guha, and Eckart Walther at Netscape. It was released in March 1999 for use on the My.Netscape.Com portal. This version became known as RSS 0.9. In July 1999, Dan Libby of Netscape produced a new version, RSS 0.91, which simplified the format by removing RDF elements and incorporating elements from Dave Winer&#x27;s news syndication format. Libby also renamed the format from RDF to RSS Rich Site Summary and outlined further development of the format in a &quot;futures document&quot;.

This would be Netscape&#x27;s last participation in RSS development for eight years. As RSS was being embraced by web publishers who wanted their feeds to be used on My.Netscape.Com and other early RSS portals, Netscape dropped RSS support from My.Netscape.Com in April 2001 during new owner AOL&#x27;s restructuring of the company, also removing documentation and tools that supported the format.

Two parties emerged to fill the void, with neither Netscape&#x27;s help nor approval: The RSS-DEV Working Group and Dave Winer, whose UserLand Software had published some of the first publishing tools outside Netscape that could read and write RSS.

Winer published a modified version of the RSS 0.91 specification on the UserLand website, covering how it was being used in his company&#x27;s products, and claimed copyright to the document. A few months later, UserLand filed a U.S. trademark registration for RSS, but failed to respond to a USPTO trademark examiner&#x27;s request and the request was rejected in December 2001.

The RSS-DEV Working Group, a project whose members included Aaron Swartz, Guha and representatives of O&#x27;Reilly Media and Moreover, produced RSS 1.0 in December 2000. This new version, which reclaimed the name RDF Site Summary from RSS 0.9, reintroduced support for RDF and added XML namespaces support, adopting elements from standard metadata vocabularies such as Dublin Core.

In December 2000, Winer released RSS 0.92
a minor set of changes aside from the introduction of the enclosure element, which permitted audio files to be carried in RSS feeds and helped spark podcasting. He also released drafts of RSS 0.93 and RSS 0.94 that were subsequently withdrawn.

In September 2002, Winer released a major new version of the format, RSS 2.0, that redubbed its initials Really Simple Syndication. RSS 2.0 removed the &quot;type&quot; attribute added in the RSS 0.94 draft and added support for namespaces. To preserve backward compatibility with RSS 0.92, namespace support applies only to other content included within an RSS 2.0 feed, not the RSS 2.0 elements themselves. (Although other standards such as Atom attempt to correct this limitation, RSS feeds are not aggregated with other content often enough to shift the popularity from RSS to other formats having full namespace support.)

Because neither Winer nor the RSS-DEV Working Group had Netscape&#x27;s involvement, they could not make an official claim on the RSS name or format. This has fueled ongoing controversy in the syndication development community as to which entity was the proper publisher of RSS.

One product of that contentious debate was the creation of an alternative syndication format, Atom, that began in June 2003. The Atom syndication format, whose creation was in part motivated by a desire to get a clean start free of the issues surrounding RSS, has been adopted as IETF Proposed Standard .

In July 2003, Winer and UserLand Software assigned the copyright of the RSS 2.0 specification to Harvard&#x27;s Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society, where he had just begun a term as a visiting fellow. At the same time, Winer launched the RSS Advisory Board with Brent Simmons and Jon Udell, a group whose purpose was to maintain and publish the specification and answer questions about the format.

In September 2004, Stephen Horlander created the now ubiquitous RSS icon () for use in the Mozilla Firefox browser.

In December 2005, the Microsoft Internet Explorer team and
Microsoft Outlook team announced on their blogs that they were adopting Firefox&#x27;s RSS icon. In February 2006, Opera Software followed suit. This effectively made the orange square with white radio waves the industry standard for RSS and Atom feeds, replacing the large variety of icons and text that had been used previously to identify syndication data.

In January 2006, Rogers Cadenhead relaunched the RSS Advisory Board without Dave Winer&#x27;s participation, with a stated desire to continue the development of the RSS format and resolve ambiguities. In June 2007, the board revised their version of the specification to confirm that namespaces may extend core elements with namespace attributes, as Microsoft has done in Internet Explorer 7. According to their view, a difference of interpretation left publishers unsure of whether this was permitted or forbidden.

== Example ==
RSS is XML-formatted plain text. The RSS format itself is relatively easy to read both by automated processes and by humans alike. An example feed could have contents such as the following:
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;channel&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;RSS Title&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;This is an example of an RSS feed&lt;/description&gt;

&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
===Aggregators===
When retrieved, RSS reading software could use the XML structure to present a neat display to the end users. There are various news aggregator software for desktop and mobile devices, but RSS can also be built-in inside web browsers or email clients like Mozilla Thunderbird.

== Variants ==
There are several different versions of RSS, falling into two major branches (RDF and 2.*).

The RDF (or RSS 1.*) branch includes the following versions:
* RSS 0.90 was the original Netscape RSS version. This RSS was called &quot;RDF Site Summary&quot;, but was based on an early working draft of the RDF standard, and was not compatible with the final RDF Recommendation.
* RSS 1.0 is an open format by the RSS-DEV Working Group, again standing for &quot;RDF Site Summary&quot;. RSS 1.0 is an RDF format like RSS 0.90, but not fully compatible with it, since 1.0 is based on the final RDF 1.0 Recommendation.
* RSS 1.1 is also an open format and is intended to update and replace RSS 1.0. The specification is an independent draft not supported or endorsed in any way by the RSS-Dev Working Group or any other organization.

The RSS 2.* branch (initially UserLand, now Harvard) includes the following versions:
* RSS 0.91 is the simplified RSS version released by Netscape, and also the version number of the simplified version originally championed by Dave Winer from Userland Software. The Netscape version was now called &quot;Rich Site Summary&quot;; this was no longer an RDF format, but was relatively easy to use.
* RSS 0.92 through 0.94 are expansions of the RSS 0.91 format, which are mostly compatible with each other and with Winer&#x27;s version of RSS 0.91, but are not compatible with RSS 0.90.
* RSS 2.0.1 has the internal version number 2.0. RSS 2.0.1 was proclaimed to be &quot;frozen&quot;, but still updated shortly after release without changing the version number. RSS now stood for &quot;Really Simple Syndication&quot;. The major change in this version is an explicit extension mechanism using XML namespaces.

Later versions in each branch are backward-compatible with earlier versions (aside from non-conformant RDF syntax in 0.90), and both versions include properly documented extension mechanisms using XML Namespaces, either directly (in the 2.* branch) or through RDF (in the 1.* branch). Most syndication software supports both branches. &quot;The Myth of RSS Compatibility&quot;, an article written in 2004 by RSS critic and Atom advocate Mark Pilgrim, discusses RSS version compatibility issues in more detail.

The extension mechanisms make it possible for each branch to copy innovations in the other. For example, the RSS 2.* branch was the first to support enclosures, making it the current leading choice for podcasting, and is the format supported for that use by iTunes and other podcasting software; however, an enclosure extension is now available for the RSS 1.* branch, mod_enclosure. Likewise, the RSS 2.* core specification does not support providing full-text in addition to a synopsis, but the RSS 1.* markup can be (and often is) used as an extension. There are also several common outside extension packages available, e.g. one from Microsoft for use in Internet Explorer 7.

The most serious compatibility problem is with HTML markup. Userland&#x27;s RSS reader—generally considered as the reference implementation—did not originally filter out HTML markup from feeds. As a result, publishers began placing HTML markup into the titles and descriptions of items in their RSS feeds. This behavior has become expected of readers, to the point of becoming a de facto standard. Though there is still some inconsistency in how software handles this markup, particularly in titles. The RSS 2.0 specification was later updated to include examples of entity-encoded HTML; however, all prior plain text usages remain valid.

, tracking data from www.syndic8.com indicates that the three main versions of RSS in current use are 0.91, 1.0, and 2.0, constituting 13%, 17%, and 67% of worldwide RSS usage, respectively. These figures, however, do not include usage of the rival web feed format Atom. , the syndic8.com website is indexing 546,069 total feeds, of which 86,496 (16%) were some dialect of Atom and 438,102 were some dialect of RSS.

== Modules ==
The primary objective of all RSS modules is to extend the basic XML schema established for more robust syndication of content. This inherently allows for more diverse, yet standardized, transactions without modifying the core RSS specification.

To accomplish this extension, a tightly controlled vocabulary (in the RSS world, &quot;module&quot;; in the XML world, &quot;schema&quot;) is declared through an XML namespace to give names to concepts and relationships between those concepts.

Some RSS 2.0 modules with established namespaces are:
* Media RSS (MRSS) 2.0 Module
* OpenSearch RSS 2.0 Module 

== Interoperability ==
Although the number of items in an RSS channel is theoretically unlimited, some news aggregators do not support RSS files larger than 150KB. For example, applications that rely on the Common Feed List of Windows might handle such files as if they were corrupt, and not open them. Interoperability can be maximized by keeping the file size under this limit.

Podcasts are distributed using RSS. To listen to a podcast, a user adds the RSS feed to their podcast client, and the client can then list available episodes and download or stream them for listening or viewing. To be included in a podcast directory the feed must for each episode provide a title, description, artwork, category, language, and explicit rating. There are some services that specifically indexes and is a search engine for podcasts.

Some BitTorrent clients support RSS. RSS feeds which provide links to .torrent files allow users to subscribe and automatically download content as soon as it is published.

===RSS to email===

Some services deliver RSS to an email inbox, sending updates from user&#x27;s personal selection and schedules. Examples of such services include IFTTT, Zapier and others. Conversely, some services deliver email to RSS readers. Further services like e.g. Gmane allow to subscribe to feeds via NNTP.

It may be noted that email clients such as Thunderbird supports RSS natively.

== RSS compared with Atom ==
Both RSS and Atom are widely supported and are compatible with all major consumer feed readers. RSS gained wider use because of early feed reader support. Technically, Atom has several advantages: less restrictive licensing, IANA-registered MIME type, XML namespace, URI support, RELAX NG support.

The following table shows RSS elements alongside Atom elements where they are equivalent.

Note: the asterisk character (*) indicates that an element must be provided (Atom elements &quot;author&quot; and &quot;link&quot; are only required under certain conditions).

== Current usage ==
Several major sites such as Facebook and Twitter previously offered RSS feeds, but have reduced or removed support. Additionally, widely used readers such as Shiira, FeedDemon, and particularly Google Reader, have all been discontinued as of 2013, citing declining popularity in RSS. RSS support was removed in OS X Mountain Lion&#x27;s versions of Mail and Safari, although the features were partially restored in Safari 8. Mozilla removed RSS support from Mozilla Firefox version 64.0, joining Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge [Legacy] which do not include RSS support.

Since the late 2010s, however, there has been an uptick in RSS interest again. In 2018, &quot;Wired&quot; published an article named &quot;It&#x27;s Time for an RSS Revival&quot;, citing that RSS gives more control over content compared to algorithms and trackers from social media sites. At that time, Feedly was the most popular RSS reader. Microsoft Edge (New) on Windows and Google Chrome on Android added the ability to follow RSS feeds as of 2021.

<doc id="93492" wikidata="Q906328" url="?curid=93492" title="Distributed Component Object Model">
<text>Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) is a proprietary Microsoft technology for communication between software components on networked computers. DCOM, which originally was called &quot;Network OLE&quot;, extends Microsoft&#x27;s COM, and provides the communication substrate under Microsoft&#x27;s COM+ application server infrastructure.

The extension COM into Distributed COM was due to extensive use of DCE/RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls) – more specifically Microsoft&#x27;s enhanced version, known as MSRPC. 

In terms of the extensions it added to COM, DCOM had to solve the problems of:
*Marshalling – serializing and deserializing the arguments and return values of method calls &quot;over the wire&quot;.
*Distributed garbage collection – ensuring that references held by clients of interfaces are released when, for example, the client process crashed, or the network connection was lost.
*Combining significant numbers of objects in the client&#x27;s browser into a single transmission in order to minimize bandwidth utilization.

One of the key factors in solving these problems is the use of DCE/RPC as the underlying RPC mechanism behind DCOM. DCE/RPC has strictly defined rules regarding marshalling and who is responsible for freeing memory.

DCOM was a major competitor to CORBA. Proponents of both of these technologies saw them as one day becoming the model for code and service-reuse over the Internet. However, the difficulties involved in getting either of these technologies to work over Internet firewalls, and on unknown and insecure machines, meant that normal HTTP requests in combination with web browsers won out over both of them. Microsoft, at one point, attempted to remediate these shortcomings by adding an extra HTTP transport to DCE/RPC called &quot;ncacn_http&quot; (Network Computing Architecture connection-oriented protocol).

DCOM was publicly launched as a beta for Windows 95 September 18, 1996.

DCOM is supported natively in all versions of Windows starting from Windows 95, and all versions of Windows Server since Windows NT 4.0

== Security improvements ==
As part of the initiative that began at Microsoft as part of Secure Development Lifecycle to re-architect insecure code, DCOM saw some significant security-focused changes in Windows XP Service Pack 2.

In response to a security vulnerability reported by Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab in June 2021, Microsoft released security updates for several versions of Windows and Windows Server, hardening access to DCOM.

== Alternative versions and implementations ==
COMsource is a Unix based implementation of DCOM, allowing interoperability between different platforms. Its source code is available, along with full and complete documentation, sufficient to use and also implement an interoperable version of DCOM. COMsource comes directly from the Windows NT 4.0 source code, and includes the source code for a Windows NT Registry Service. 

In 1995, Digital and Microsoft announced Affinity for OpenVMS (also known as NT Affinity) which was intended to allow OpenVMS to serve as the persistence layer for Windows NT client-server applications. As part of this initiative, an implementation of the Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) was added to OpenVMS Alpha. In order to support DCOM, VMS was provided with implementations of the Windows Registry, NTLM authentication, and a subset of Win32 APIs needed to support COM. DCOM was first added to OpenVMS V7.2-1 for the Alpha. A similar implementation of DCOM was added to Digital Unix as part of the AllConnect program.

TangramCOM was a separate project from Wine, focusing on implementing DCOM on Linux-based smartphones.

<text>Tourin () is a type of French soup, which is composed of onion, tomato, and/or garlic. It is also known as ouliat () or le tourin d&#x27;ail doux, meaning &#x27;smooth garlic soup&#x27;. Many regions have their own variations on the recipe. Typically, many recipes include as many as 20 cloves of garlic for a much stronger flavor. However other recipes include an equal measure of both onions and garlic to even out the taste. 

To prepare, the minced garlic (and sliced onions if included) are sautéed until soft and a simple roux is made by adding flour. Chicken stock or water is added to the mixture and is simmered over low heat to reduce. Egg whites are slowly drizzled in, not unlike egg drop soup, but whisked very rapidly to prevent large curds from forming. It is further thickened by tempering an egg yolk mixed with vinegar, which is then added to the soup.

<doc id="93494" wikidata="Q1026823" url="?curid=93494" title="Saved by the Bell">
<text>Saved by the Bell is an American television teen sitcom created by Sam Bobrick for NBC. The series premiered, in prime time, on August 20, 1989, a Sunday night. Targeted at kids and teens, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; was broadcast in the United States on Saturday mornings, later as the flagship series in NBC&#x27;s TNBC lineup. A spin-off of the Disney Channel series &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;, the show follows a group of high school friends and their principal at the fictional Bayside High School in Los Angeles. Primarily focusing on lighthearted comedic situations, it occasionally touches on serious social issues, such as drug use, driving under the influence, homelessness, remarriage, death, women&#x27;s rights, and environmental issues. The series starred Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Dustin Diamond, Lark Voorhies, Dennis Haskins, Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Mario Lopez. The series ran for four seasons, airing its final episode, again in primetime, on May 22, 1993, a Saturday night.

The show spawned two spin-off series: &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; (1993–1994), a primetime series that follows several of the characters to college, and &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; (1993–2000), a Saturday morning series that follows a new group of students at Bayside High School. The series also spawned two TV movies, &quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot; in 1992 and &quot;Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas&quot; in 1994.

In later years, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; has been classified as educational and informational. The show was named one of the &quot;20 Best School Shows of all Time&quot; by AOL TV.

==Characters==
In casting &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;, Peter Engel knew the success of the show would not hinge on Miss Bliss herself, but on her students. Engel particularly envisioned one character, Zack Morris, who &quot;would be that incorrigible kid who could lie to your face, letting you know very well that he&#x27;s lying, and make you love him for it all the same.&quot; Engel insisted that the show could not go on without Zack Morris, but he turned out to be one of the most difficult characters to cast. Engel&#x27;s casting director, Shana Landsburg, finally happened across fourteen-year old Mark-Paul Gosselaar and was immediately struck by the teen&#x27;s charisma, charm, and good looks. After a quick read-through, Gosselaar was immediately given the role.

After casting Zack Morris, the next character sought after was Morris&#x27;s nerdy friend, Samuel &quot;Screech&quot; Powers. Gosselaar was asked to read through the script with a number of kids, and a second audition was scheduled for finalists. It was Gosselaar himself who insisted that Dustin Diamond was right for the part as he believed Diamond was Screech in real life. After reading through the script, Diamond was given the part, although Engel later found out that he had misread his head shot and Diamond was considerably younger than the rest of the cast—a fact that, had he been aware, might have prevented Engel from casting him.

Lisa Turtle was originally conceived as a rich Jewish princess from Long Island, spoiled, materialistic, and obsessed with shopping. While still casting for the role, actress Lark Voorhies was brought into Engel&#x27;s office, and he immediately knew she was perfect for the role despite the fact that it meant rewriting the character.

The school principal, Mr. Gerald Belding, as originally conceived on &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;, was an older, humorless man, and was played in the 1987 pilot by character actor Oliver Clark. After the show was retooled for Disney Channel, the character&#x27;s first name was changed to Richard and he was recast, with Dennis Haskins ultimately winning the role. Mr. Belding was rewritten to be significantly younger and to have a much different sense of humor.

When &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; was retooled as &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, four actors and their respective characters from the original series were brought over to the new series: Gosselaar, Diamond, Voorhies, and Haskins. The rest of the cast was fired, and Engel sought to replace them with new characters who would complement the old ones.
The first of the new characters, A.C. Slater, was conceived as a young John Travolta type who would be an army brat and wear a leather jacket. He was originally conceived of as Italian-American. However, when all efforts to cast the character were unsuccessful, Engel asked that the part be opened up to other ethnicities. Two days later, Mario Lopez, a dancer and drummer of Latino descent from &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot;, auditioned for the role. Lopez was judged the best actor who auditioned, and was cast.

For Kelly Kapowski, the love interest of both Zack and Slater, producers were able to narrow the field down to three actresses: Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, and Jennie Garth. Engel had originally met Thiessen in 1988 while casting for &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; and was impressed with how much her acting had improved. He wanted her for the role, believing she had the perfect all-American girl appeal for the role, while others felt that Berkley, as the more experienced actress, would be a more reliable choice. Ultimately, Engel convinced the others after a read-through with Lopez, and Thiessen received the role.

Engel and the other producers did not want to lose Berkley, however, as she was the strongest actress they had seen during casting. Berkley originally auditioned for the role of Karen, a love-interest of Zack&#x27;s on &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;, but lost the role because she was so much taller than Gosselaar at the time. Engel believed that, now that her height was more even with the rest of the cast, she could be perfect. They were not having much luck in casting the third new character, Jessie Spano, who was conceived as a strong, feminist activist and a straight-A student, so Engel suggested offering the role to Berkley, who gladly accepted it.

Rounding out the new cast was real-life magician Ed Alonzo as Max, the owner of the gang&#x27;s frequent cafe hangout, The Max, who frequently performed magic tricks. Alonzo&#x27;s role, however, would ultimately only last through the end of the first season, and he left after a single guest appearance during season two.

In 1992, &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; unexpectedly received an order for an additional eleven episodes to be shot after the graduation episode. However, Thiessen and Berkley had already decided to leave the show. Though producers knew they could not replace Kelly and Jessie, they also knew they could not leave Lisa as the only girl on the show. A new character, Tori Scott, was created as a cool but pretty biker girl who would also serve as a love interest for Zack and also act as a nemesis for him initially. Leanna Creel was cast for the part. Rather than develop a second new character, the producers decided to rely more on minor recurring characters such as Ginger, Ox, and Big Pete.

==Production==

===&quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;===

In 1986, Brandon Tartikoff, then-president of NBC, asked Peter Engel to develop the pilot for a new prime time series, &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot;. Tartikoff had been inspired by his sixth grade teacher, Miss Bliss, and had long wanted to make a show about someone like her. The series would focus on Miss Carrie Bliss, a recently married sixth grade teacher at the fictional John F. Kennedy Junior High School in Indianapolis. Though Sandy Duncan was originally considered for the titular role, the series ultimately became a vehicle for British former child star Hayley Mills. Veteran writer Sam Bobrick was brought on to write the episode and the cast included future stars Jonathan Brandis, Brian Austin Green, and Jaleel White.

The pilot aired on June 11, 1987, but NBC had decided not to pick up the series even before it was shown. Tartikoff did not want to give up on the show, though, and made a deal with the Disney Channel to air thirteen episodes of the series in prime time. If the initial order did well, Disney was prepared to order an additional seventy-seven. The show was completely retooled, with Mills the sole remaining cast member from the pilot. Miss Bliss&#x27;s class was changed from the sixth grade to the eighth grade, and the kids would be more central to the story.

&quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; aired from 1988 to 1989. However, the show failed to pick up a following and did poorly in the ratings. By the time the last episode aired, Disney had already decided against ordering more.

===&quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;===
Tartikoff felt there had been strong elements to &quot;Good Morning, Miss Bliss&quot; and wanted to try the show again with a different time slot and a different approach. The elements featuring the kids had been well-received, so Tartikoff wanted to drop Miss Bliss from the show altogether and focus entirely on the teens. NBC had been losing the high end of their animated audience, kids from ten to twelve, so the idea was to create a live action comedy to air on Saturday mornings, a new idea at the time.

Engel was skeptical of the new format at first, and did not want to make children&#x27;s programming. However, his wife convinced him that making the show would be a worthwhile endeavor, and he soon told Tartikoff he would do the show. Engel felt, however, that Indianapolis was not exciting as a location, and moved the show to a fictionalized version of a Los Angeles neighborhood, &quot;the Palisades.&quot; The main locations of the show would be the teenager&#x27;s school, Bayside High, and The Max, a fictional eatery they frequent. In addition, they would film before a live studio audience.

The majority of the cast was replaced, and Tartikoff gave a seven episode commitment for the show. In a meeting with Engel and Tartikoff, senior producer Tom Tenowich suggested the name &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;. Though Engel hated the name, Tartikoff loved it. The name stuck, and filming commenced, with the first episode, &quot;Dancing to the Max,&quot; airing in prime time on August 20, 1989.

==Episodes==

==Theme song==
The theme song for &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; was written by composer Scott Gayle against the implicit instructions of Engel. Though Engel had not been able to keep the show from being named &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, he was determined to prevent the phrase from showing up in the theme. He gave explicit orders to his team of composers that he would not accept any theme that referenced the title, and the group agreed to leave out the phrase.

A week later, Engel listened to the first four composers and, though they followed his instructions, the songs were flat and nothing special. Gayle played his song next and, though he explicitly violated Engel&#x27;s instructions, Engel couldn&#x27;t help but admit it was the best and perfect for the show. Engel would later comment that he was glad Gayle had not followed his instructions.

==Films==

===&quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot;===

In 1992, NBC approved the production of a feature-length made-for-television &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; film to air in prime time. Titled &quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot;, the film followed the six teenagers from the show as they vacationed in Hawaii with Kelly&#x27;s grandfather, Harry Bannister (Dean Jones). They soon discover Mr. Belding also happens to be there, and the seven are caught up in a plan to save Harry&#x27;s resort from a greedy developer.

The film was written by Bennet Tramer and directed by Don Barnhart. Due to budget constraints, much of the film was shot in Santa Monica, with only location shots that could not easily be faked shot in Hawaii. The shooting schedule in Hawaii turned out to be massive, even after Engel and Barnhart scouted the location. Real-life lifeguards were hired as extras during beach scenes to ensure the safety of the cast.

&quot;Variety&quot; said, &quot;The Clearasil demo will eat it up, older viewers may choke on the realization that Dean Jones is old enough to be a grandfather.&quot; &quot;Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style&quot; was successful in the ratings, and paved the way for &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; airing in prime time.

===&quot;Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas&quot;===
Following the cancellation of &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; on a cliffhanger in 1994, NBC President Warren Littlefield commissioned a second film to serve as a series finale for both &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; and the original show. The story features Zack, Kelly, Slater, Screech, and Lisa traveling to Las Vegas so Zack and Kelly can elope after their parents disapprove of their impending marriage.

==Home media==
Lionsgate Home Entertainment released all four seasons of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, which contains 86 episodes, broken into five seasons (season 4 split in two) on DVD in Region 1. However, the episodes on these and all subsequent releases are the edited versions as used in syndication, with scenes cut for time. Lionsgate released the two feature-length TV movies on DVD, in Region 1, on August 7, 2007. On March 13, 2012, Lionsgate (distributed by Alliance Films) released &quot;Saved by the Bell: The Complete Collection&quot; on DVD in Canada. The 13-disc set features all 86 episodes of the series as well as the two television films.

On November 5, 2013, Lionsgate released a complete-series set in the United States. It does not contain the reunion movies but does include some bonus commentaries.

On October 16, 2018, Shout! Factory re-released the complete series on DVD in Region 1. Unlike the previous releases, the set includes season four in its entirety, rather than having it being broken up into two parts. Bonus features include selected episodes commentaries by pop culture historian Russell Dyball, executive producer Peter Engel, and cast members Dustin Diamond, Dennis Haskins, and Lark Voorhies.

In Region 2, Fabulous Films has released all 5 seasons on DVD in the UK.

Contender Entertainment Group released the 2 reunion tele-films on DVD in the UK in 2004.

In Region 4, Shock Entertainment released Season One on DVD in Australia on February 10, 2010.

==Spin-offs==
The show was popular enough to justify two spin-offs, both of which premiered in 1993.

===&quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot;===

Following the conclusion of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, an idea came out of a focus group for &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot;, in addition to creating a new cast of characters, to continue the story of the original &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; cast. The new show aired in prime time and feature only Zack, Slater, and Screech from the original cast attending the fictional California University and living in a suite with a new cast of girls. Kelly later joined the cast after the pilot.

Although the premiere garnered decent viewership, ratings quickly declined against the competition of &quot;Full House&quot; and &quot;Rescue 911&quot;, two well-established, popular shows in prime time. &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; was ultimately cancelled after only one season of nineteen episodes. The events of the final episode would lead directly into the second &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; film: &quot;Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas&quot;.

===&quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot;===

In 1993, NBC decided it wanted to extend the &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; franchise with a new show, &quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot;. Also set at Bayside, the show would follow a new cast of characters as they navigate their high school years. Reprising his role from the original series was Dennis Haskins, once again as their principal, Mr. Belding. Following the cancellation of &quot;Saved by the Bell: The College Years&quot; in 1994, Peter Engel asked Dustin Diamond to reprise his role as Samuel &quot;Screech&quot; Powers, who was returning to Bayside on a work-study program as Mr. Belding&#x27;s administrative assistant.

&quot;Saved by the Bell: The New Class&quot; ran for seven seasons and 143 episodes, from 1993 to 2000. The cast was constantly revolving, with Haskins as the only constant throughout all seven seasons. The show was not generally well-received, and some believe that it failed to recapture the charm of the original series.

On April 9, 2006, Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim announced that &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; would air at midnight as a two-week special starting April 17. On April 19, 2006, Adult Swim also posted on their website that &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; was back in production. A week later, the announcement was exposed as a joke.

On March 27, 2009, NBC&#x27;s &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; launched a campaign to get the cast on board for a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; reunion. Fans signed an online petition and pledged their support for the cast to reunite on the show. Dennis Haskins, Lark Voorhies, Mario Lopez, Elizabeth Berkley, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar agreed to a reunion. Gosselaar reprised his role as Zack Morris in a skit on &quot;Late Night&quot; on June 8, 2009, while promoting his then current TNT drama, &quot;Raising the Bar&quot;. The spoof interview closed with a performance of &quot;Friends Forever,&quot; originally by Zack Attack, where Zack played guitar and sang with backing from Fallon&#x27;s house band, The Roots. Tiffani Thiessen posted a parody video to the website Funny or Die, where she claimed she was too busy to join the reunion.

The cast reunited in August 2009 for a photo shoot in &quot;People&quot;. Diamond was not invited to participate in the photo shoot because of poor relationships with the rest of the cast. Diamond&#x27;s image was also edited out of the 1989 cast photo that was used on the cover inset of an issue of &quot;People&quot; to show how the cast looked 20 years later.

The cast convened again when Haskins, Diamond, Gosselaar, Voorhies, and Lopez did their own voices in a &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; &quot;Saw&quot; parody, called &quot;Sawed by the Bell&quot;, on &quot;Boo Cocky&quot;, a season three episode of &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. Gosselaar also provided audio commentary for the episode on the DVD.

On February 4, 2015, the cast appeared on a skit on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;. Haskins, Gosselaar, Lopez, Berkley and Thiessen all participated, though Voorhies and Diamond did not, with Thiessen&#x27;s real-life pregnancy, Lopez&#x27;s involvement with &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; and Berkley&#x27;s film &quot;Showgirls&quot; the targets of some of the humor.

==Revival==
On September 17, 2019, it was announced that a single-camera revival of the series was in development for NBC&#x27;s planned streaming service, Peacock, with Tracey Wigfield serving as showrunner. The series will center around a new group of Bayside High students from &quot;overprivileged&quot; and working-class families, among the latter of which were transferred to the school as part of a plan by now-California Governor Zack Morris—whose administration experiences controversy for closing too many low-income high schools—to send lower-income students to the highest-performing schools in the state.

Berkley and Lopez were initially announced as the only cast members of the original series to be reprising their roles, though by January 2020, it was confirmed that Mark-Paul Gosselaar (who was confirmed to appear in three episodes of the revival series&#x27; first season as well as receive an executive producer credit) and Tiffani Thiessen—both of whom were confirmed by Gosselaar in separate September 2019 interviews with &quot;Variety&quot; and TMZ to have not been initially approached to reprise their characters—would also be returning in some capacity; however, it was unclear as to which of the other cast members would return. Lark Voorhies reprised her role as Lisa Turtle for one episode and Ed Alonzo also returned as Max. Other actors confirmed to appear as new characters in the series are John Michael Higgins (as Principal Toddman, who took over Mr. Belding&#x27;s role as the head of Bayside High) and Josie Totah (as Lexi, described as a &quot;beautiful, sharp-tongued cheerleader and the most popular girl at Bayside High who is both admired and feared by her fellow students&quot;).

==Other media==

===Soundtrack===
A CD and cassette tape soundtrack was released on April 11, 1995. It contained songs used throughout the series. The track listing is as follows:

# &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;
# &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave With Your Love&quot;
# &quot;Go for It!&quot;
# &quot;Love Me Now&quot;
# &quot;Make My Day&quot;
# &quot;Friends Forever&quot;
# &quot;Did We Ever Have a Chance?&quot;
# &quot;Deep Within My Heart&quot;
# &quot;Surfer Dude&quot;
# &quot;Gone Hawaiian&quot;
# &quot;School Song&quot;
# &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; 

===List of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; novels===
There have been 22 standalone novels based on the show, all written by Beth Cruise (a pseudonym used by the American author Beth Henderson). The first 16 were published by Collier Books in the USA, a Macmillan imprint. The final 6 were published by Aladdin Paperbacks, a Simon &amp; Schuster imprint. All 22 novels were later republished by Boxtree Ltd in the UK. The books all feature the main cast, and have storylines that relate to (but often differ from and expand) the main plots in the TV shows. The list below is given in the order provided by the original publishers (Collier and then Aladdin), although this is not strictly the order in which the books were first published: by the time Bayside Madness was released in 1993, for instance, at least five other titles had already been published the previous year. Collier Books only introduced a numbered order (including numbers on front covers) with book 12, Computer Confusion, in 1994. Boxtree added numbers to its front covers at least as early as book 10, Kelly&#x27;s Hero, which it published in 1995.

Several unofficial books relating to the show have also been published.
===Comic books===
In 1992, Harvey Comics published a short-lived &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; Comic series. Seven issues were released, including a Christmas and a Summer special. The comic was generally not well-received, with comic book critic Matt D. Wilson saying &quot;its character likenesses for the show&#x27;s starts were rough at best.&quot;

In 2014, Lion Forge Comics announced that its new all-ages imprint, ROAR Comics, would publish a new &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; comic. Set initially during the gang&#x27;s freshman year of high school, the comic serves as a modern update to the classic series. It premiered in March 2014 alongside ROAR&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Punky Brewster&quot;.

===&quot;Behind the Bell&quot; book===
In 2009, Dustin Diamond published an inside story of the show&#x27;s cast and crew from his point of view, entitled &quot;Behind the Bell&quot;. The book paints an unflattering portrait of many of Diamond&#x27;s colleagues and their alleged backstage behavior. Some of Diamond&#x27;s claims have been refuted by colleagues and questioned by critics. Diamond also alleges in the book that he had sex with 2,000 women, one of them being NBC&#x27;s Vice President of children&#x27;s programming, Linda Mancuso, who was 18 years his senior. Diamond later disclaimed responsibility for much of the book&#x27;s content, blaming his ghostwriter for fabricating salacious stories.

&quot;The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story&quot; aired on Lifetime on September 1, 2014.

===&quot;Bayside! The Musical!&quot;===
In September 2013, &quot;Bayside! The Musical!&quot; an unauthorized parody of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, opened at NYC&#x27;s Theatre 80. &quot;Bayside! The Musical!&quot; was named a &quot;New York Times&quot; Critics&#x27; Pick. &quot;Bayside! The Musical!&quot; was written and directed by Bob and Tobly McSmith, the same creative team behind &quot;Showgirls! The Musical!&quot; In contrast to the wholesome nature of &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot;, &quot;Bayside! The Musical!&quot; contains strong language and adult situations throughout. The show&#x27;s run has been extended 6 times.

Bayside! originally debuted in 2005 under the title &quot;Bayside! The UnMusical!&quot; The following year a sequel was produced called &quot;Bayside 2! Electric Screechio&quot; The show then took several years off, reopening in 2012 at NYC&#x27;s Kraine Theatre with a revamped script and new cast Following the success of &quot;Showgirls! The Musical!&quot; the show&#x27;s creators Bob and Tobly McSmith revisited their script and reworked it from the ground up.

The show has had appearances from original &quot;Saved by the Bell&quot; cast members such as Dustin Diamond and Dennis Haskins.

The name for the COM port started with the original IBM PC. IBM had called the four well-defined communication RS-232 ports the &quot;COM&quot; ports, starting from COM1 through COM4. In BASICA and PC DOS you can open these ports as &quot;COM1:&quot; through &quot;COM4:&quot;, and all PC compatibles using MS-DOS used the same denotation. Most PC-compatible computers in the 1980s and 1990s had one or two COM ports.

By 2007, most computers shipped with only one or no physical COM ports. Today, few consumer-grade PC-compatible computers include COM ports, though some of them do still include a COM header on the motherboard.

After the RS-232 COM port was removed from most consumer-grade computers, an external USB-to-UART serial adapter cable was used to compensate for the loss. A major supplier of these chips is FTDI.

==I/O addresses==
The COM ports are interfaced by an integrated circuit such as 16550 UART. This IC has seven internal 8-bit registers which hold information and configuration data about which data is to be sent or was received, the baud rate, interrupt configuration and more. In the case of COM1, these registers can be accessed by writing to or reading from the I/O addresses to . 

If the CPU, for example, wants to send information out on COM1, it writes to I/O port , as this I/O port is &quot;connected&quot; to the UART IC register which holds the information that is to be sent out.

The COM ports in PC-compatible computers are typically defined as:
*COM1: I/O port , IRQ 4
*COM2: I/O port , IRQ 3
*COM3: I/O port , IRQ 4
*COM4: I/O port , IRQ 3

<doc id="93497" wikidata="Q302022" url="?curid=93497" title="ActiveX">
<text>ActiveX is a deprecated software framework created by Microsoft that adapts its earlier Component Object Model (COM) and Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) technologies for content downloaded from a network, particularly from the World Wide Web. Microsoft introduced ActiveX in 1996. In principle, ActiveX is not dependent on Microsoft Windows operating systems, but in practice, most ActiveX controls only run on Windows. Most also require the client to be running on an x86-based computer because ActiveX controls contain compiled code.

ActiveX is still supported in the &quot;Internet Explorer mode&quot; of Microsoft Edge (which has a different, incompatible extension system, as it is based on Google&#x27;s Chromium project).

==ActiveX controls==
ActiveX was one of the major technologies used in component-based software engineering. Compared with JavaBeans, ActiveX supports more programming languages, but JavaBeans supports more platforms. ActiveX is supported in many rapid application development technologies, such as Active Template Library, Delphi, JavaBeans, Microsoft Foundation Class Library, Qt, Visual Basic, Windows Forms and wxWidgets, to enable application developers to embed ActiveX controls into their products.

Many Microsoft Windows applications—including many of those from Microsoft itself, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Windows Media Player—use ActiveX controls to build their feature-set and also encapsulate their own functionality as ActiveX controls which can then be embedded into other applications. Internet Explorer also allows the embedding of ActiveX controls in web pages.

==History==
Faced with the complexity of OLE 2.0 and with poor support for COM in MFC, Microsoft simplified the specification and rebranded the technology as ActiveX in 1996. Even after simplification, users still required controls to implement about six core interfaces. In response to this complexity, Microsoft produced wizards, ATL base classes, macros and C++ language extensions to make it simpler to write controls.

Starting with Internet Explorer 3.0 (1996), Microsoft added support to host ActiveX controls within HTML content. If the browser encountered a page specifying an ActiveX control via an codice_1 tag (the codice_1 tag was added to the HTML 3.2 specification by Charlie Kindel, the Microsoft representative to the W3C at the time) it would automatically download and install the control with little or no user intervention. This made the web &quot;richer&quot; but provoked objections (since such controls, in practice, ran only on Windows, and separate controls were required for each supported platform: one for Windows 3.1/Windows NT 3.51, one for Windows NT/95, and one for Macintosh M68K/PowerPC.) and security risks (especially given the lack of user intervention). Microsoft subsequently introduced security measures to make browsing including ActiveX safer.

For example:

* digital signing of installation packages (Cabinet files and executables)
* controls must explicitly declare themselves safe for scripting
* increasingly stringent default security settings
* Internet Explorer maintains a blacklist of bad controls

ActiveX was controversial from the start; while Microsoft claimed programming ease and good performance compared to Java applets in its marketing materials, critics of ActiveX were quick to point out security issues and lack of portability, making it impractical for use outside protected intranets. The ActiveX security model relied almost entirely on identifying trusted component developers using a code signing technology called Authenticode. Developers had to register with Verisign (US$20 per year for individuals, $400 for corporations) and sign a contract, promising not to develop malware. Identified code would then run inside the web browser with full permissions, meaning that any bug in the code was a potential security issue; this contrasts with the sandboxing already used in Java at the time.

==Platform support==
In October 1996, Microsoft released a beta version of the ActiveX Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Macintosh, including a plug-in for Netscape Navigator on the Mac, and announced its plan to support ActiveX on Solaris later that year. Six months and two more beta releases later, there had yet to be any commercially available Macintosh ActiveX plugins.

In 1997, NCompass Labs in cooperation with Microsoft released a plug-in for Netscape Navigator to support ActiveX.

Documentation for ActiveX core technology resides at The Open Group and may be read for free.

Despite Microsoft&#x27;s previous efforts to make ActiveX cross-platform, most ActiveX controls would not and will not work on all platforms, so using ActiveX controls to implement essential functionality of a web page restricts its usefulness. The government of South Korea, in a software-agnostic gravitating move, started in circa 2015 to remove the technology from their public websites in order to make their website accessible to more platforms.

While Microsoft made significant efforts to push the cross-platform aspect of ActiveX by way of publishing the API, ultimately the cross-platform effort failed due to the ActiveX controls being written in C or C++ and being compiled in Intel x86 Assembly language, making them executable only on Windows machines where they can call the standard Win32 APIs.

Microsoft dropped ActiveX support from the Windows Store edition of Internet Explorer 10 in Windows 8. In 2015, Microsoft released Microsoft Edge [Legacy], the replacement for Internet Explorer, with no support for ActiveX; this event marked the end of ActiveX technology in Microsoft&#x27;s web browser development. Microsoft [New] Edge, however, includes an &quot;Internet Explorer mode&quot; feature, which supports ActiveX.

==ActiveX in non-Internet Explorer applications==
* Mozilla ActiveX Control was last updated in late 2005, and runs in Firefox 1.5.
*ScriptActive for Netscape Navigator last updated in 1997 can run ActiveX controls but requires a special HTML tag.
*Running ActiveX scripts in Google Chrome is possible through the utilization of several extensions, including one which emulates an Internet Explorer tab within the Chrome application.

==Other ActiveX technologies==
Microsoft has developed a large number of products and software platforms using ActiveX objects. They are still used (e.g., websites still using ASP):

* Active Scripting (formerly known as ActiveX Scripting) is the technology used in Windows to bridge scripting engines like JScript, VBScript or ActivePerl and hosting applications like Internet Explorer, Active Server Pages, or third-party applications that implement a scripting host.
* ActiveX Document is a Microsoft technology that allows users to view and edit Microsoft Word, Excel, and PDF documents inside web browsers.
* Active Messaging, later renamed Collaboration Data Objects
* Active Server Pages (ASP)
* ActiveMovie, later renamed DirectShow
* ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)
* ActiveX Streaming Format (ASF), renamed Advanced Streaming Format, then to Advanced Systems Format

The county seat is Brentwood. Rockingham County is part of the Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metropolitan Statistical Area and the greater Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
The area that today is Rockingham County was first settled by Europeans moving north from the Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts as early as 1623. The government was linked tightly with Massachusetts until New Hampshire became a separate colony in 1679, but counties were not introduced until 1769.

Rockingham was identified in 1769 as one of five original counties for the colony. It is named for Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham, who had been Prime Minister of the UK from 1765 to 1766. The county was organized in 1771, with its county seat at Exeter. In 1823, certain townships from northwestern Rockingham (and some northern townships from Hillsborough County) became part of the formation of Merrimack County. In 1844, its area was further reduced by the formation of Belknap County to the northwest. In 1997, the county court facilities were moved to Brentwood, a rural town adjacent to Exeter.

<text>Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a proprietary technology developed by Microsoft that allows embedding and linking to documents and other objects. For developers, it brought OLE Control Extension (OCX), a way to develop and use custom user interface elements. On a technical level, an OLE object is any object that implements the codice_1 interface, possibly along with a wide range of other interfaces, depending on the object&#x27;s needs.

==Overview==
OLE allows an editing application to export part of a document to another editing application and then import it with additional content. For example, a desktop publishing system might send some text to a word processor or a picture to a bitmap editor using OLE. The main benefit of OLE is to add different kinds of data to a document from different applications, like a text editor and an image editor. This creates a Compound File Binary Format document and a master file to which the document makes reference. Changes to data in the master file immediately affect the document that references it. This is called &quot;linking&quot; (instead of &quot;embedding&quot;).

OLE can also be used to transfer data between different applications using drag and drop or clipboard operations.

==History==

===OLE 1.0===

OLE 1.0, released in 1990, was an evolution of the original Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) concept that Microsoft developed for earlier versions of Windows. While DDE was limited to transferring limited amounts of data between two running applications, OLE was capable of maintaining active links between two documents or even embedding one type of document within another.

OLE servers and clients communicate with system libraries using virtual function tables, or VTBLs. The VTBL consists of a structure of function pointers that the system library can use to communicate with the server or client. The server and client libraries, and , were originally designed to communicate between themselves using the message.

OLE 1.0 later evolved to become an architecture for software components known as the Component Object Model (COM), and later DCOM.

When an OLE object is placed on the clipboard or embedded in a document, both a visual representation in native Windows formats (such as a bitmap or metafile) is stored, as well as the underlying data in its own format. This allows applications to display the object without loading the application used to create the object, while also allowing the object to be edited, if the appropriate application is installed.

The Object Packager, a component of OLE, shipping from Windows 3.1 up to Windows XP allows a non-OLE object to be &quot;packaged&quot; so it can be embedded into an OLE client.

===OLE 2.0===

OLE 2.0 was the next evolution of OLE, sharing many of the same goals as version 1.0, but was re-implemented on top of the COM instead of using VTBLs directly. New features were OLE automation, drag-and-drop, in-place activation and structured storage. Monikers evolved from OLE 1 object names, and provided a hierarchical object and resource naming system similar to URLs or URIs, which were independently invented. Windows now has merged the two technologies supporting a URL Moniker type, and a Moniker URL scheme.

===OLE custom controls===
OLE custom controls were introduced in 1994 as a replacement for the now deprecated Visual Basic Extension controls. Instead of upgrading these, the new architecture was based on OLE. In particular, any container that supported OLE 2.0 could already embed OLE custom controls, although these controls cannot react to events unless the container supports this. OLE custom controls are usually shipped in the form of a dynamic link library with the .ocx extension. In 1996 all interfaces for controls (except IUnknown) were made optional to keep the file size of controls down, so they would download faster; these were then called ActiveX Controls.

==Technical details==

OLE objects and containers are implemented on top of the Component Object Model; they are objects that can implement interfaces to export their functionality. Only the IOleObject interface is compulsory, but other interfaces may also need to be implemented if the functionality exported by those interfaces is required.

To ease understanding of what follows, some terminology has to be explained. The view status of an object is whether the object is transparent, opaque, or opaque with a solid background, and whether it supports drawing with a specified aspect. The site of an object is an object representing the location of the object in its container. A container supports a site object for every object contained.

What follows is a list of interfaces, grouped by the object that usually needs to implement them. Interfaces usually implemented by the OLE object are usually called on by the OLE container, and vice versa. Note that in the following list indentation indicates interface inheritance. All non-indented interfaces derive from IUnknown.

===OLE object===
;DataObject
:When implemented, enables the transfer of data, and notification of data changes. It must be implemented by objects that are to support drag-and-drop, being copied to or pasted from the clipboard, or being linked or embedded in a containing document.
;ObjectWithSite
:Allows the caller to inform the OLE object of its site. This functionality is also provided by OleObject, but ObjectWithSite can be used, when supported, if OleObject is not used for other matters.
;OleCache
:Allows visual presentations from a DataObject to be cached. This allows an embedded object to store its visual representation, thus enabling it to be displayed later without needing to start the application that was used to create the object.
:&quot;Usually the stock implementation is used.&quot;
:;OleCache2
::Provides more fine-grained control over caching.
::&quot;Usually the stock implementation is used.&quot;
;OleCacheControl
:This interface is not called by the container, but internally by the object to allow it to receive notifications of when its DataObject is running, thereby allowing it to subscribe to notifications of data changes of that object and thus allowing it to update the cached presentation properly.
:&quot;Usually the stock implementation is used.&quot;
;OleDocument
:Allows the OLE object to support multiple views of its data, as well as a few related functions.
;OleDocumentView
:A document object (an object that implements OleDocument) implements this interface for every view. It allows the caller to set the site of the object, query and set the size of the object and to show and activate it, as well as some related functions.
;OleWindow
:;OleInPlaceActiveObject
::Called by the outermost container of an object to interact with it while it&#x27;s active, e.g. to process accelerator keys in the container&#x27;s message queue that are meant for the contained object.
:;OleInPlaceObject
::Called by the container to activate or deactivate the object.
::;IOleInPlaceObjectWindowless
:::A windowless object is an object that doesn&#x27;t have its own window but it instead displayed in its container&#x27;s window. It is used by the container to relay messages received by the container&#x27;s window that are intended for the contained object. For example, if the mouse is moved over a window, Windows places a mouse move message along with the mouse coordinates in the message queue of the window. If this window contains windowless embedded objects, the message may have to be relayed to such an object if the coordinates of the mouse-pointer are over this object. For similar reasons this interface also provides access to the object&#x27;s DropTarget interface.
;OleLink
:Allows the object to support linking, e.g. by allowing the container to set the source of a linked object.
:&quot;Usually the stock implementation is used.&quot;
;OleObject
:Arguably the most important interface for an OLE object. For example, it allows the container to inform the object of its site, initialize the object from data, to open and close it, to query and set the size of the object, to ask for notifications on the container&#x27;s AdviseSink and to execute objects defined as &quot;verbs&quot; on the object. These verbs often include &quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Edit&quot;, but can also include other verbs. One of the verbs is defined to be the principal verb, and it is executed when the user double-clicks an object.
;ViewObject
:Allows an object to draw itself directly, without passing a DataObject to the container. For objects that support both DataObject and this interface, the underlying implementation is usually shared.
:;ViewObject2
::Additionally allows the caller to query the size of the object.
::;ViewObjectEx
:::Adds support for flicker-free drawing of transparent objects, hit-testing for objects with irregular shapes and setting the size of an object.

===OLE container===
;IAdviseSink
:Allows the implementer to receive notifications when the object is saved, closed, or renamed, or when its data or visual presentation changes.
:;IAdviseSink2
::Additionally allows the implementer to receive notifications when the link source of the OLE object changes.
:;IAdviseSinkEx
::Additionally allows the implementer to receive notifications when the view status of the OLE object changes.
;IOleClientSite
:This interface allows the caller to obtain information on the container and location of an object, as well requesting that the object be saved, resized, shown, hidden, et cetera.
;IOleDocumentSite
:Allows the caller to ask for the object on this site to be activated immediately. If this interface is implemented, IOleClientSite, IOleInPlaceSite and IAdviseSink must be implemented as well.
;IOleContainer
:This interface allows the caller to enumerate embedded objects in a container, or to find such objects by name. It is primarily useful if the container wishes to support links to embedded objects.
;IOleWindow
:;IOleInPlaceUIWindow
::Enables embedded objects to negotiate space for toolbars on the container&#x27;s window.
::;IOleInPlaceFrame
:::Allows the caller to ask the container to insert its menu items in an empty menu that will become the cooperative menu. Also allows the caller to ask the container to show or hide this menu, to show or hide dialog boxes, and to process accelerator keys received by the contained object intended for the container.
:;IOleInPlaceSite
::If a container implements this interface, it allows embedded objects to be activated in place, i.e. without opening in a separate window. It provides access to the container&#x27;s IOleInPlaceUIWindow.
::;IOleInPlaceSiteEx
:::If a container implements this interface, it allows embedded objects to check whether they need to redraw on activation or deactivation. It also allows them to request their UI to activate.
:::;IOleInPlaceSiteWindowless
::::If a container wishes to support windowless embedded objects, it needs to provide functionality to embedded objects to replace the functionality normally provided by an embedded object&#x27;s window. For example this interface provides a way to access the container&#x27;s window&#x27;s device context, thereby enabling the embedded object to draw in the container&#x27;s window.
;IOleUILinkContainer
:Contains the methods that the standard OLE dialog boxes that manage linked objects use to update linked objects in a container, or to query and change their sources. Used by the &quot;Links&quot;, &quot;Change source&quot;, &quot;Update links&quot; and &quot;Object properties&quot; dialog boxes.
:;IOleUILinkInfo
::Additionally allows the dialog boxes to query when linked objects were last updated, and whether this was done automatically or manually.
:;IOleUIObjInfo
::Contains the methods needed by the &quot;Object properties&quot; dialog box. For example if the user opens the &quot;Object properties&quot; dialog box and asks for the object to be converted to another type, a method on this interface is called.
;IOleUndoManager
:Provides a centralized undo service to both the container itself and to embedded objects. When an undoable action is performed, an IOleUndoUnit is created and added to the IOleUndoManager

===Other===
;IDataAdviseHolder
:The methods of IDataObject that pertain to data change notifications can be implemented by calling the methods of this interface.
:&quot;Usually the stock implementation is used.&quot;
;IOleAdviseHolder
:The methods of IOleObject that pertain to notifications can be implemented by calling the methods of this interface.
:&quot;Usually the stock implementation is used.&quot;
;IDropSource
:Implemented by objects that can be dragged, i.e. that can be the source of a drag-and-drop operations. When implemented it allows the object to draw drag-and-drop effects, and to specify when the object is dropped, or the drag-and-drop operation is cancelled.
;IDropTarget
:Implemented by objects that accept dropped objects, i.e. that can be the target of drag-and-drop operations. When implemented it allows the target to specify if a dropped object will be accepted, and what happens to an object after it is dropped.
;IOleCommandTarget
:Can be implemented by objects (OLE objects, OLE containers, and other objects) that wish to support certain standard commands. It allows callers to query if commands are supported, and to execute commands. Commands that an object might typically wish to implement may include things like &quot;delete&quot;, &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;copy&quot;, &quot;paste&quot;, &quot;undo&quot;, &quot;find&quot;, &quot;print&quot;, &quot;save&quot;, &quot;zoom&quot;, and so on. Currently 58 standard commands have been defined, and they include commands commonly used by office software, web browsers and similar applications.
;IOleUndoUnit
:Represents an action that can be undone. It contains all information necessary to undo an action. It is created by objects and containers, so that undoable actions can be added to the container&#x27;s IOleUndoManager.
:;IOleParentUndoUnit
::Allows an undo unit to contain other undo units. In essence this allows the undo unit to act as an undo stack, grouping undo units together. For example, if a macro is run, all undo-able actions performed by the macro may be grouped together in one undo unit.
;IOleWindow
:This interface represents a window of a container or contained object. It allows callers to obtain the handle of the window, and to toggle the context-sensitive help function. When the context-sensitive help function is turned on, typically the mouse-pointer changes to an arrow with a question mark to indicate that clicking a user interface element will result in opening a help window.

== Competition ==
OpenDoc technology tried to compete with OLE. Some of Microsoft&#x27;s competitors considered OpenDoc to be more robust and easier to use. OpenDoc allowed users to view and edit information across applications, directly in competition with Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary OLE standard. In 1993 some Microsoft competitors established a consortium called the Component Integration Laboratories (&quot;CIL&quot;) to develop OpenDoc as an open standard for cross-platform linking and embedding.

Microsoft required OLE compatibility as a condition of Microsoft&#x27;s certification of an application&#x27;s compatibility with Windows 95. Microsoft initially announced that applications using OpenDoc would be deemed compatible with OLE, and would receive certification for Windows 95. Microsoft later reversed the decision and said that applications using OpenDoc might not receive certification at all. Microsoft withheld specifications and debugged versions of OLE until after it had released its competing applications.

==Interoperability==
Use of OLE objects limits interoperability, because these objects are not widely supported in programs for viewing or editing files outside of Microsoft Windows (e.g., embedding of other files inside the file, such as tables or charts from a spreadsheet application in a text document or presentation file). If software that understands an OLE object is not available, the object is usually replaced by a picture (bitmap representation of the object) or not displayed at all.

<text>Hillsborough County is the most populous county in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. As of the 2020 census, the population was 422,937, almost one-third the population of the entire state. Its county seats are Manchester and Nashua, the state&#x27;s two biggest cities. Hillsborough is northern New England&#x27;s most populous county as well as its most densely populated.

Hillsborough County comprises the Manchester-Nashua, NH Metropolitan Statistical Area, which in turn constitutes a portion of the Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area.

==History==
Hillsborough was one of the five original counties identified for the old Province of New Hampshire in 1769, and was named for Wills Hill, 1st Earl of Hillsborough, who was British Secretary of State for the Colonies at the time. The county was formally organized at Amherst on March 19, 1771.

In 1823, twelve townships of Hillsborough Country – Andover, Boscawen, Bradford, Dunbarton, Fishersfield (now Newbury), Henniker, Hooksett, Hopkinton, New London, Salisbury, Sutton, and Warner – became part of Merrimack County. The town of Merrimack along the Merrimack River in south-central Hillsborough County was not included in the newly formed county to the north. Hillsborough County&#x27;s administrative functions were moved from Amherst to Milford in 1866, and then to the current seats of Manchester and Nashua in 1869.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.8%) is water. The highest point in Hillsborough county is Pack Monadnock Mountain at .

==Politics and government==

In the 2012 presidential election, &quot;Time&quot; had listed Hillsborough as one of five critical counties affecting the outcome in the swing state of New Hampshire. Obama ended up winning with a margin of 50%–49%. Despite its more urban nature, Hillsborough County has historically been a more Republican leaning part of the state, although there is evidence to suggest that is changing. In 2020, Joe Biden and Jeanne Shaheen won Hillsborough County by a wider margin than they won statewide by. Biden also received the highest percentage of the vote for a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s 1964 landslide, largely driven due to large swings to Democrats in the county&#x27;s historically Republican suburban communities.

<text>Grafton County is a county in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. As of the 2020 census, the population was 91,118. Its county seat is the town of Haverhill. In 1972, the county courthouse and other offices were moved from Woodsville, a larger village within the town of Haverhill, to North Haverhill.

Grafton County is part of the Claremont-Lebanon, NH–VT Micropolitan Statistical Area.

The county is the home of Dartmouth College and Plymouth State University. &quot;Progressive Farmer&quot; rated Grafton County fourth in its list of the &quot;Best Places to Live in Rural America&quot; in 2006, citing low unemployment (despite slow economic growth), a favorable cost of living, and the presence of White Mountain National Forest, the state&#x27;s only national forest.

==History==
Grafton was one of the five counties originally identified for New Hampshire in 1769. It was named for Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, who had been a supporter of American causes in Parliament, and who was serving as British Prime Minister at the time. The county was organized at Haverhill in 1771, and originally included the entire northern frontier of New Hampshire, including several towns now in Vermont. In 1803, the northern area was removed for the formation of Coos County. The three counties to the south were Strafford, Hillsborough and Cheshire, and the eastern edge bordered the &quot;District of Maine&quot;. In 1797, the county had 50 townships, 17 locations, and a population of 23,093.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which are land and (2.3%) are water. It is the second-largest county in New Hampshire by area.

Grafton County is heavily rural. About half of its area is in the White Mountain National Forest. Squam Lake, featured in the film &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;, and the Old Man of the Mountain landmark are here, as are Dartmouth College and the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Many of the 4,000-foot mountains of New Hampshire are within the county. The Appalachian Trail passes through parts of at least ten towns in the county.

<doc id="93506" wikidata="Q188472" url="?curid=93506" title="Artaxerxes II">
<text>Arses (; 445 – 359/8 BC), known by his regnal name Artaxerxes II ( ; ), was King of Kings of the Achaemenid Empire from 405/4 BC to 358 BC. He was the son and successor of Darius II () and his mother was Parysatis.

Soon after his accession, Artaxerxes II faced opposition from his younger brother Cyrus the Younger, who assembled an army composed of troops from his Lydian and Ionian satrapies as well as Greek mercenaries in his bid for the throne. The forces of the brothers clashed at Cunaxa in 401 BC, which resulted in the defeat and death of Cyrus. Following this, Artaxerxes II had to contend with several other revolts; a revolt by Evagoras I () in Cyprus between 391–380 BC, by the Phoenicians in , and most importantly, the revolts by the western satraps (known as the Great Satraps&#x27; Revolt) in the 360s and 350s BC, led by distinguished figures such as Datames, Ariobarzanes, and Autophradates.

The rulers of the Parthian Empire notably considered Artaxerxes II their progenitor.

== Name and etymology ==
The given name of Artaxerxes II was, as rendered in Greek, Arses (; Babylonian: &quot;Aršu&quot;), derived from the Old Persian &quot;*Ṛšā-&quot; (&quot;man&quot;, &quot;hero&quot;). He was also widely known by the hypocorism , which is attested in several Greek forms including (Plutarch), and (&quot;Persica&quot;). From &quot;Arsaces&quot; also derives the name of the Arsacid dynasty, which ruled the Parthian Empire and claimed descent from Artaxerxes II himself.

 () is the Greek rendition of the Old Persian &quot;Artaxšaçā&quot; (&quot;whose reign is through truth&quot;). It is known in other languages as; Elamite &quot;Ir-tak-ik-ša-iš-ša&quot;, &quot;Ir-da-ik-ša-iš-ša&quot;; Akkadian &quot;Ar-ta-ʾ-ḫa-šá-is-su&quot;; Middle Persian &quot;Ardaxšēr&quot; and New Persian &quot;Ardašīr&quot;.

Greek authors gave Artaxerxes II the epithet &quot;Mnemon&quot; (; ), meaning &quot;remembering&quot; or &quot;having a good memory.&quot;

== Historiography ==
The life and reign of Artaxerxes II is mostly attested in classical Greek sources, which generally focuses on the history of the western front. However, due to Artaxerxes II&#x27;s younger brother Cyrus the Younger recruiting many Greeks during his rebellion against his brother, the reign of Artaxerxes II is well documented until Cyrus&#x27; death at the Battle of Cunaxa in 401 BC. Following that, detailed information on the rest of Artaxerxes II&#x27;s reign become much more sparse.

Plutarch, when writing his &quot;Life of Artaxerxes II&quot;, used Ctesias, Dinon, Xenophon, and a few others as references. The work is the only biography of an Achaemenid king. According to the modern historian Carsten Binder, Plutarch&#x27;s work is an &quot;eloquent but hardly reliable source of information&quot; and that it &quot;should be treated with the greatest caution&quot;.

== Background and early life ==
Arses was the eldest son of Darius II, who ruled the Persian Achaemenid Empire from 424 to 405/4 BC. His mother was Parysatis, a half-sister of Darius II. His age at death is variously given as 86 (Lucian) and 94 (Dinon) years, which would place his birth around 453 or 445 BC. Briant simply notes that Arses was born before his father&#x27;s accession in 424, while another author states that he was &quot;at least in his late seventies in the early 360s&quot;. Darius II and Parysatis had thirteen children, most of whom died prematurely. Thus the only known full siblings of Arsaces were his younger brothers Cyrus, Ostanes, Oxathres, and an older sister, Amestris. 

With the exception of Arsaces and Cyrus, not much is known about the children of Darius II and Parysatis. Cyrus was most likely born in 424/423 BC, just after the accession of Darius II. In 408 BC, at the age of 15 or 16, Cyrus was appointed the satrap of Lydia, Greater Phrygia, and Cappadocia. He also succeeded Tissaphernes as the commander-in-chief of the Persian force stationed at Castolus, east of the city of Sardis. Cyrus was given the title of &quot;karanos&quot; (Old Iranian: &quot;*Karana&quot;), which greatly expanded his authority both politically and militarily, and allowed him to become largely autonomous.

Before his accession, Arsaces married Stateira, the daughter of the Persian nobleman Hydarnes, who was descended from Hydarnes, one of the seven Persian conspirators who overthrew the Pseudo-Smerdis. The marriage was part of a political alliance that Darius had sought during his early reign, due to facing opposition against his rule. Amestris was also married to Hydarnes&#x27; son Terituchmes, while Hydarnes was appointed the satrap of Hyrcania.

When Darius II was on his deathbed, Arsaces was by his side. According to Xenophon, Darius II summoned Cyrus, who arrived with Tissaphernes and 300 Greek hoplites. Plutarch, however, reports that it was Parysatis who summoned Cyrus, as she favoured him over Arsaces. He further adds that she attempted to convince Darius II to choose Cyrus as his heir, as the position was still vacant. Modern historians question Plutarch&#x27;s account, and state that Arsaces must have already been chosen as heir previously, probably several years earlier.

During the coronation of Arsaces at the southern capital of Pasargadae, Cyrus allegedly attempted to have his brother assassinated. The plan was exposed by Tissaphernes, but Cyrus was spared following the intervention of Parysatis and sent back to Asia Minor. The authenticity of this event is deemed uncertain by modern historians. According to Binder, the transition of power between Darius II and Arsaces was seemingly peaceful. During his investiture, Arsaces adopted the throne name of Artaxerxes.

== Reign ==
=== Dynastic conflict with Cyrus the Younger (401 BC) ===
Tissaphernes noted that Cyrus the Younger&#x27;s claims to be on a military expedition to attack the Pisidians had many flaws that led him to believe that Cyrus was planning to revolt. These claims became realized when Cyrus began to seek political support for his campaign. Cyrus found support from Sparta, who sent soldiers to aid the campaign against Artaxerxes II. Notably, Cyrus found support from a Persian kingdom of Cilicia, who contributed to the effort through funds. During this time, due to Tissaphernes&#x27; reports, Artaxerxes II began to build up a force to contend with his younger brother&#x27;s revolt.

By the time of Darius II&#x27;s death, Cyrus had already been successful in defeating the Syrians and Cilicians and was commanding a large army made up of his initial supporters plus those who had joined him in Phrygia and beyond. Upon hearing of his father&#x27;s death, Cyrus the Younger declared his claim to the throne, based on the argument that he was born to Darius and Parysatis after Darius had ascended to the throne, while Artaxerxes was born prior to Darius II&#x27;s gaining the throne.
Artaxerxes II initially wanted to resolve the conflict peacefully, but the negotiations fell through. Cyrus also ran into issues with the locals, who were loyal to Artaxerxes. Artaxerxes defended his position against his brother Cyrus the Younger, who with the aid of a large army of Greek mercenaries called the &quot;Ten Thousand&quot;, attempted to usurp the throne. Though Cyrus&#x27; mixed army fought to a tactical victory at the Battle of Cunaxa in Babylon (401 BC), Cyrus himself was killed in the exchange by Mithridates, rendering his victory irrelevant. The Greek historian Xenophon, himself one of the leaders of the Greek troops, would later recount this battle in the &quot;Anabasis&quot;, focusing on the struggle of the now-stranded Greek mercenaries to return home.

===Conflict against Sparta (396-387 BC)===
Artaxerxes became involved in a war with Persia&#x27;s erstwhile allies, the Spartans, during the Corinthian War (395-387 BC). The Spartans under their king Agesilaus II had started by invading Asia Minor in 396–395 BC. To redirect the Spartans&#x27; attention to Greek affairs, Artaxerxes subsidized their enemies through his envoy Timocrates of Rhodes; in particular, the Athenians, Thebans, and Corinthians received massives subsidies. Tens of thousands of darics, the main currency in Achaemenid coinage, were used to bribe the Greek states to start a war against Sparta. These subsidies helped to engage the Spartans in what would become known as the Corinthian War. According to Plutarch, Agesilaus said upon leaving Asia Minor, &quot;I have been driven out by 10,000 Persian archers&quot;, a reference to &quot;Archers&quot; (&quot;Toxotai&quot;) the Greek nickname for the darics from their obverse design, because that much money had been paid to politicians in Athens and Thebes to start a war against Sparta.

The Achaemenids, allied with Athens, managed to utterly destroy the Spartan fleet at the Battle of Cnidus (394 BC). After that, the Achaemenid satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, Pharnabazus II, together with former Athenian admiral Conon, raided the coasts of Peloponnesia, putting increased pressure on the Spartans. This encouraged the resurgence of Athens, which started to bring back under her control the Greek cities of Asia Minor, thus worrying Artaxerxes II that his Athenian allies were becoming too powerful.

====Final agreement with Sparta (387 BC)====

In 386 BC, Artaxerxes II betrayed his allies and came to an arrangement with Sparta, and in the Treaty of Antalcidas, he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. This treaty restored control of the Greek cities of Ionia and Aeolis on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland. In 385 BC, he campaigned against the Cadusians.

===Egypt campaign (373 BC)===
Although successful against the Greeks, Artaxerxes had more trouble with the Egyptians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign. An attempt to reconquer Egypt in 373 BC under the command of Pharnabazus, satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years, the Persians did manage to defeat a joint Egyptian–Spartan effort to conquer Phoenicia.

====Unfolding of the Egyptian campaign====
In 377 BC, Pharnabazus was reassigned by Artaxerxes II to help command a military expedition into rebellious Egypt, having proven his ability against the Spartans.
After four years of preparations in the Levant, Pharnabazus gathered an expeditionary force of 200,000 Persian troops, 300 triremes, 200 galleys, and 12,000 Greeks under Iphicrates. The Achaemenid Empire had also been applying pressure on Athens to recall the Greek general Chabrias, who was in the service of the Egyptians, but in vain. The Egyptian ruler Nectanebo I was thus supported by Athenian General Chabrias and his mercenaries.

The Achaemenid force landed in Egypt with the Athenian general Iphicrates near Mendes in 373 BC. The expedition force was too slow, giving time to the Egyptians to strengthen defenses. Pharnabazus and Iphicrates appeared before Pelusium, but retired without attacking it, Nectanebo I, king of Egypt, having added to its former defences by laying the neighboring lands under water, and blocking up the navigable channels of the Nile by embankments. (Diodorus Siculus xv. 42; Cornelius Nepos, &quot;Iphicrates&quot; c. 5.) Fortifications on the Pelusiac branch of the Nile ordered by Nectanebo forced the enemy fleet to seek another way to sail up the Nile. Eventually the fleet managed to find its way up the less-defended Mendesian branch. At this point, the mutual distrust that had arisen between Iphicrates and Pharnabazus prevented the enemy from reaching Memphis. Then, the annual Nile flood and the Egyptian defenders&#x27; resolve to defend their territory turned what had initially appeared as certain defeat for Nectanebo I and his troops into a complete victory.

After several weeks, the Persians and their Greek mercenaries under Iphicrates had to re-embark. The expedition against Egypt had failed. It was the end of the career of Pharnabazus, who was now over 70 years old. Pharnabazus was replaced by Datames to lead a second expedition to Egypt, but he failed and then started the &quot;Satraps&#x27; Revolt&quot; against the Great King.

===Revolt of the Satraps (372-362 BC)===

The Achaemenid defeat in Egypt led to unrest among the Achaemenid nobility. From 372 BC, many western satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire started to rebel against Artaxerxes II, in the Great Satraps&#x27; Revolt, starting with the powerful satrap Datames. Following the failure of Pharnabazus II in Egypt, Datames had been entrusted by the Persian king with the chief command of a force designed for the recovery of Egypt, but the machinations of his enemies at the Persian court, and the risks to which he was in consequence exposed, induced him to change his plan, and throw off his allegiance to the king. He withdrew with the troops under his command into Cappadocia, and made common cause with the other satraps who were revolting from Persia.

The Pharaoh Nectanebo provided financial support to the rebelling satraps and re-established ties with both Sparta and Athens. Artaxerxes II finally quashed the revolt of the satraps by 362 BC.

===Peace mediation in the Theban–Spartan War (368-366 BC)===

Artaxerxes again attempted to mediate in conflicts between the Greek city-states at the time of the Theban hegemony, especially the Theban–Spartan War. He sent Philiscus of Abydos, a hyparch (vice-regent) and military commander of the Achaemenid satrap Ariobarzanes, to Delphi in order to help the Greek negotiate peace. The objective of Philicus of Abydos was such to help broker a Common Peace between the Greek belligerents reunited at Delphi. The negotiation collapsed when Thebes refused to return Messenia to the Spartans.

Before returning to Abydos, Philicus used Achaemenid funds to finance an army for the Spartans, suggesting that he was acting in support of the Spartans from the beginning. With the Achaemenid financing of a new army, Sparta was able to continue the war. Among the mercenaries whom he had recruited, Philiscus gave 2,000 to the Spartans. He also probably provided funds to the Athenians and promised them, on behalf of the King, to help them recover the Chersonese militarily. Both Philiscus and Ariobarzanes were made citizens of Athens, a remarkable honor suggesting important services rendered to the city-state.

During autumn of 367 BCE, first the Spartans, soon followed by the Athenians, the Arcadians, the Argives, the Eleans, the Thebans, and other Greek city-states, sent envoys to Susa in attempts to obtain the support of Achaemenid king Artaxerxes II in the Greek conflict. The Achaemenid king proposed a new peace treaty, this time highly tilted in favour of Thebes, which required Messenia to remain independent and that the Athenian fleet to be dismantled. This Peace proposal was rejected by most Greek parties except Thebes.

Sparta and Athens, dissatisfied with the Persian king&#x27;s support of Thebes, decided to provide careful military support to the opponents of the Achaemenid king. Athens and Sparta provided support for the revolted satraps, in particular Ariobarzanes. Sparta sent a force to Ariobarzanes under an aging Agesilaus II, while Athens sent a force under Timotheus, which was however diverted when it became obvious that Ariobarzanes had entered frontal conflict with the Achaemenid king. An Athenian mercenary force under Chabrias was also sent to the Egyptian Pharaoh Tachos, who was also fighting against the Achaemenid king.

==Building projects==

Much of Artaxerxes&#x27; wealth was spent on building projects. He restored the Palace of Darius I at Susa, and also the fortifications; including a strong redoubt at the south-east corner of the enclosure and gave Ecbatana a new apadana and sculptures.

=== Tomb at Persepolis ===
The tomb of Artaxerxes II is located at Persepolis, and was built on the model of his predecessors at Naqsh-e Rustam. On the upper register of the tomb appear reliefs of the Emperor, supported by the soldiers of all ethnicities of the Empire. On the lintel over each figure appears a trilingual inscription describing each ethnicity. These are known collectively as &quot;Inscription A2Pa&quot;.

== Religious policies ==
Since the reign of Darius the Great (), Achaemenid inscriptions make mention of unnamed gods alongside Ahura Mazda, who was considered the supreme god of the Zoroastrian pantheon by the royal family. It was first under Artaxerxes II that the identities of these gods were uncovered. In a trilingual inscription at Susa, he invokes the deities Anahita and Mithra alongside Ahura Mazda.

Artaxerxes II was thus the first known Achaemenid king to recognize Anahita, who was the divinity of &quot;the Waters&quot; and hence associated with fertility, healing and wisdom. He promoted the worship of Anahita, erecting temples and statues of the goddess across the empire. This included the cities of Ecbatana, Susa, and Babylon. 

The temple of Anahita in Istakhr was also most likely founded by Artaxerxes II. At the start of the 3rd century AD, the temple was repaired and adorned by the Persian Sasanian family, who acted as the hereditary caretakers of the temple.

== Legacy ==
The Persian Empire under Artaxerxes II was viewed as a political power that had many unfortunate complications, such as the many wars with Greece. One aspect of his legacy which would have great influence upon his successors was his conflict with Cyrus the Younger. This conflict was remembered due to the power vacuum that followed, allowing the Satrap Revolt and the rebellion of Egypt. Artaxerxes II was also remembered for his works to restore monuments of his predecessors. His largest restoration was that of the Palace of Darius in Susa. He would also be remembered for his tomb in Persepolis.

The image of Artaxerxes from contemporary foreign sources depicts him in a similar light to his image among those in the Achaemenid Empire. The Greek portrayal highlights his long rule with many conflicts and shortcomings of Artaxerxes II in his ability to control his empire. Greek sources also focus on his problems in his court with his harem and eunuchs, as in Claudius Aelianus&#x27;s accounts of Aspasia of Phocaea and Tiridates. Greek sources portray Artaxerxes II as sad in his reign.

==Identification==
The Jewish high priest Johanan is mentioned in the Elephantine papyri dated to 407 BC, i.e., during Darius II&#x27;s reign, and is also mentioned in Ezra 6:10 after the reign of Darius (Ezra 6:1) and during the rule of Artaxerxes (Ezra 7:1), thereby supporting the chronological sequence.

Amongst others, it has been suggested that Artaxerxes II was the Ahasuerus mentioned in the Book of Esther. Plutarch in his &quot;Lives&quot; (AD 75) records alternative names &quot;Oarses&quot; and &quot;Arsicas&quot; for Artaxerxes II Mnemon given by Deinon (c. 360–340 BC) and Ctesias (Artexerxes II&#x27;s physician) respectively. These derive from the Persian name &quot;Khshayarsha&quot; as do &quot;Ahasuerus&quot; (&quot;(Arta)Xerxes&quot;) and the hypocoristicon &quot;Arshu&quot; for Artaxerxes II found on a contemporary inscription (&quot;LBAT&quot; 162). These sources thus arguably identify Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II in light of the names used in the Hebrew and Greek sources and accords with the contextual information from Pseudo-Hecataeus and Berossus as well as agreeing with Al-Tabari and Masudi&#x27;s placement of events. The 13th century Syriac historian Bar-Hebraeus in his &quot;Chronography&quot;, also identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II citing the sixth century AD historian John of Ephesus.

==Issue==
Artaxerxes II is reported to have had a number of wives. His main wife was Stateira, until she was poisoned by Artaxerxes&#x27; mother Parysatis in about 400 BC. Artaxerxes II is said to have more than 115 sons from 350 wives.

<doc id="93507" wikidata="Q54447" url="?curid=93507" title="Coös County, New Hampshire">
<text>Coös County (, with two syllables) or Coos County is the northernmost county in the U.S. state of New Hampshire. As of the 2020 census, the population was 31,268, making it the least-populated county in the state. The county seat is Lancaster.

Coös County is part of the Berlin, NH–VT Micropolitan Statistical Area. It is the only New Hampshire county on the Canada–United States border, south of the province of Quebec, and thus is home to New Hampshire&#x27;s only international port of entry, the Pittsburg–Chartierville Border Crossing. The only city in Coös County is Berlin, with the rest of the communities being towns, or unincorporated townships, gores and grants.

Major industries in Coös County include forestry and tourism, with the once-dominant paper-making industry in sharp decline. The county straddles two of the state&#x27;s tourism regions. The southernmost portion of the county is part of the White Mountains Region and is home to Mount Washington. The remainder of the county is known as the Great North Woods Region, or known locally as the North Country.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Coös&quot; derives from a Cowasuck word meaning &quot;small pines&quot;. It is one of two counties in the United States to feature a diacritic in its name, with the other being Doña Ana County in New Mexico.

The two-syllable pronunciation is sometimes indicated with a diaeresis, notably in the Lancaster-based weekly newspaper &quot;The Coös County Democrat&quot; and on some county-owned vehicles. The county government uses both spellings interchangeably. 

==History==
Coös County was separated from the northern part of Grafton County, New Hampshire, and organized at Berlin on December 24, 1803, although the county seat was later moved to Lancaster, with an additional shire town at Colebrook.

During the American Revolutionary War two units of troops of the Continental Army — Bedel&#x27;s Regiment and Whitcomb&#x27;s Rangers — were raised from the settlers of Coös. From the Treaty of Paris of 1783 until 1835, the boundaries in the northern tip of the county (and New Hampshire itself) were disputed with Lower Canada (which was soon to become part of the Province of Canada), and for some years residents of the area formed the independent Republic of Indian Stream.

In the 1810 census, there were 3,991 residents, and by 1870 there were nearly 15,000, at which point the entire county was valued at just under , with farm productivity per acre comparing favorably with that of contemporary Illinois. Other early industries included forestry and manufacturing, using 4,450 water horsepower in 1870.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.9%) is water. It is the largest county in New Hampshire by area, and borders both Vermont and Maine, as well as Canada.

Much of its mountainous area is reserved as national forest, wilderness, state parks and other public areas; these encompass most of the northern portion of the White Mountains, including all the named summits of the Presidential Range (though one, Mt. Webster, lies about from the county line). Mt. Washington&#x27;s peak is the highest in the Northeast. The Cohos Trail runs the length of the county.

The principal state highways in Coös County are New Hampshire Route 16, which runs mostly parallel to the Maine state line and through the city of Berlin, and New Hampshire Route 26, which traverses the Great North Woods from Vermont Route 102 southeast to Maine Route 26 towards Portland. The two major U.S. Highways are U.S. Route 2, which roughly bisects the county from Lancaster to the Oxford County line, and U.S. Route 3, which runs from Carroll in the south to the Pittsburg–Chartierville Border Crossing, where it continues as Quebec Route 257.

Coös County is the least populated of all New Hampshire counties, and the only one with significant amounts of unincorporated land; over half of the municipal-like entities are unincorporated townships, gores, or grants, a rarity in New Hampshire, where nearly all of the land is incorporated as towns or cities. The population of these unincorporated territories is minuscule; collectively they account for less than 1% of the population of the county, with only three (Wentworth Location, Millsfield, and Cambridge) reporting populations in the double digits for recent censuses. Approximately 1/3 of the population lives in Berlin, the only city, most populous municipality, and economic hub. Lancaster serves as the county seat.

==Politics and government==
The county is historically Republican, but in 2008 Barack Obama received 52.39% of the county&#x27;s vote. This made him the first Democratic presidential nominee to win the county since 1912 and the first Democratic presidential nominee to win an absolute majority in the county since 1884. Joe Biden later repeated this feat in 2020. However, despite the recent Democratic trend, the county has not voted more Democratic than the nation since 1888 in terms of two-party vote.

The county is politically divided between the more conservative southern half, home to several seasonal communities along the north shore of Lake Winnipesaukee including Moultonborough, Tuftonboro, and Wolfeboro, and the more liberal northern half, with several ski towns and resort towns such as Bartlett and Conway. In both the 2012 Presidential and gubernatorial elections in New Hampshire, Democratic candidates easily won the northern half of the county, and Republican candidates easily won the southern half of the county.

Carroll County is one of only thirteen counties to have voted for Obama in 2008, Romney in 2012, Trump in 2016, and Biden in 2020.

Belknap County has become the most Republican county in New Hampshire: the Republican Party is the majority political party in the county, holding 17 of 18 seats in the General Court as of December 2024. Since 1888, only three Democrats have won Belknap County: Woodrow Wilson in 1912 when the Republican Party was mortally divided between William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt; 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson swept the Northeast due to Republican Barry Goldwater&#x27;s conservative views regarding the Civil Rights Movement; and 2008, when Barack Obama swept every county in New England bar one. In 2020, Senator Jeanne Shaheen became the first Democrat to win Belknap County in a Senate race in over 50 years.

<text>Lakota mythology is the body of sacred stories that belong to the Lakota people, also known as the Teton Sioux.

==Overview==

The Lakota believe that everything has a spirit; including trees, rocks, rivers, and almost every natural being. This therefore leads to the belief in the existence of an afterlife.

==Creation==
According to Lakota belief, Inyan (Rock), was present at the very beginning, and so was the omnipresent spirit Wakan Tanka, the Great Mystery, and the darkness Han. Inyan wanted to exercise his powers, or compassion, so he created Maka (the Earth) as part of himself to keep control of his powers. But he sacrificed much of his blood by doing so, which became water, and he shriveled up, became hard, and began losing his powers. The water could not retain his powers, and Skan was created. Maka complains to Inyan that everything is cold and dark, and so he creates Anpo, the Dawn. As Anpo&#x27;s red light was not enough for Maka, Inyan creates Wi, the Sun.

Maka now wanted to be separate from Inyan, so she appealed to Skan, who is now the supreme judge of the universe. Skan then rules that Maka must stay bound to Inyan, which is why rocks are bound to soil. In another version, when Inyan created Maka, she taunted him for his impotence. Inyan appealed to Skan, and Skan banished Han to be under Maka. When Maka complained that she was too cold, Skan created Anpo and Wi to provide light and heat, and when Maka complained that she was too hot, Skan ordered that Han and Anpo to follow each other around the world, thus creating day and night.

==Notable tales==

One story from Lakota mythology is about the adventures of Ikto&#x27;mi (viewed as a hybrid of spider and man), the trickster spider god. He is very cunning, and is known for making predictions. Born full grown and had the body like a spider. In stories that involve Iktomi, he is usually the one that prevails since he is said to be wise and cunning.

Another was about the slaying of Unhcegila, a serpent monster who wreaked havoc upon the land and devoured or killed whoever who stumbles upon her. Many warriors sought to kill her to obtain a red crystal in a seventh spot on her head which functioned as her heart, as it grants its bearer great power.

In one version, Unhcegila ate the family of a warrior from the Bear Clan. The warrior was told by a Weasel spirit that if he were to be devoured by Unhcegila, he could use his knife to cut his way out and free the other victims, which he did.

In another version, Unhcegila was killed by two brothers, one of whom was blind, after a medicine woman gave them several arrows. Some accounts add that the arrows did not entirely kill Unhcegila, but injured her so greatly, that she damaged the land as she writhed in pain. When she died, the Sun dried her remains, resulting in the rock formations and skeletons that are found in the Badlands (Makȟóšiča).

In a third version, Unhcegila emerged from the primordial waters to flood the land. The resulting devastation angered Wakinyan, the Thunderbird, so he flapped his wings to dry the land, and shot lightning to destroy her heart, killing her. Her bones were scattered throughout the land.

==Afterlife==
The Lakota people believe that after death, the deceased person&#x27;s soul will go to the happy hunting ground, a realm that resembles the world of the living, but with better weather, and more plentiful animals that are easier to hunt than they are in the world of the living.

However, some accounts mention that the Sky-Road (Milky Way) is the destination of the deceased, but every deceased soul must present the proper tattoos to an old woman, Hihankara, the Owl-Maker. She will admit those who have the proper tattoos, but those who do not have the tattoos will be pushed to Earth to wander as ghosts.

<doc id="93515" wikidata="Q709718" url="?curid=93515" title="Aldhelm">
<text>Aldhelm (, ; 25 May 709), Abbot of Malmesbury Abbey, Bishop of Sherborne, and a writer and scholar of Latin poetry, was born before the middle of the 7th century. He is said to have been the son of Kenten, who was of the royal house of Wessex. He was certainly not, as his early biographer Faritius asserts, the brother of King Ine. After his death he was venerated as a saint, his feast day being the day of his death, 25 May.

==Life==

===Early life and education===
Aldhelm received his first education in the school of the Irish scholar and monk Máeldub (also &quot;Maildubh&quot;, &quot;Maildulf&quot; or &quot;Meldun&quot;) (died ), who had settled in the British stronghold of Bladon (or &quot;Bladow&quot;) on the site of the town called Mailduberi, Maldubesburg, Meldunesburg, etc., and finally Malmesbury, after him.

In 668, Pope Vitalian sent Theodore of Tarsus to be Archbishop of Canterbury. At the same time the North African scholar Hadrian became abbot of St Augustine&#x27;s at Canterbury. Aldhelm was one of his disciples, for he addresses him as the &#x27;venerable preceptor of my rude childhood.&#x27; He must, nevertheless, have been thirty years of age when he began to study with Hadrian. His studies included Roman law, astronomy, astrology, the art of reckoning and the difficulties of the calendar. He learned, according to the doubtful statements of the early lives, both Greek and Hebrew. He certainly introduces many Latinized Greek words into his works.

Ill health compelled Aldhelm to leave Canterbury and he returned to Malmesbury Abbey, where he was a monk under Máeldub for fourteen years, dating probably from 661 and including the period of his studies with Hadrian.

===Abbot of Malmesbury===
When Máeldub died, Aldhelm was appointed in 675, according to a charter of doubtful authenticity cited by William of Malmesbury, by Leuthere, Bishop of Winchester (671–676), to succeed to the direction of the monastery, of which he became the first abbot.

Aldhelm introduced the Benedictine rule and secured the right of the election of the abbot by the monks themselves. The community at Malmesbury increased, and Aldhelm was able to found two other monasteries as centres of learning, at Frome, Somerset and at Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire. Following a pilgrimage to Rome, he was given permission by Pope Sergius I in a Papal Bull of 701 to establish the monastery at Frome, where he had already built a church circa 685. The Anglo-Saxon building of St Laurence&#x27;s Church, Bradford-on-Avon dates back to his time, and may safely be regarded as his. At Malmesbury he built a new church to replace Máeldub&#x27;s modest building, and obtained considerable grants of land for the monastery. Aldhelm held this post until circa 705 when he became Bishop of Sherborne.

===Easter controversy===
Aldhelm was deputed by a synod of the church in Wessex to remonstrate with the Britons of Dumnonia (Devon and Cornwall) on the Easter controversy. British Christians followed a unique system of calculation for the date of Easter and also bore a distinctive tonsure; these customs are generally associated with the practice known as Celtic Christianity. Aldhelm wrote a long and rather acrimonious letter to king Geraint of Dumnonia (Geruntius) achieving ultimate agreement with Rome. Aldhelm also personally visited Devon &amp; Cornwall about this time, potentially on a diplomatic mission, which he recounts in his Carmen Rhythmicum.

===Bishop of Sherborne===
In 705, or perhaps earlier, Hædde, Bishop of Winchester, died, and the diocese was divided into two parts. Sherborne was the new see, of which Aldhelm became the first bishop around 705. He wished to resign the abbey of Malmesbury which he had governed for thirty years, but yielding to the remonstrances of the monks he continued to direct it until his death. He was now an old man, but he showed great activity in his new functions. The cathedral church which he built at Sherborne, though replaced later by a Norman church, is described by William of Malmesbury. In his capacity as bishop, he displayed a great deal of energy. This included going into public places where he would sing hymns and passages from the gospels interspersed with bits of clowning to draw attention to his message.

Rogers has Aldhelm claiming to have built an innovative organ, &quot;a mighty instrument, with innumerable tones, blown with belows, and enclosed in a gilded case.&quot; (It is not clear from the source cited whether the device was innovative for the premises, the locale, or a fundamental advance on existing known technologies.)

===Death and veneration===

Aldhelm was on his rounds in his diocese when he died at the church in Doulting village in 709, the Church of St Aldhelm and St Aldhelm&#x27;s Well in the village are dedicated to him. The body was taken to Malmesbury, and crosses were set up by his friend, Egwin, Bishop of Worcester, at the various stopping-places. He was buried in the church of St Michael at Malmesbury Abbey. His biographers relate miracles due to his sanctity worked during his lifetime and at his shrine. The cape in Dorset commonly known as St Alban&#x27;s Head is more properly called St. Aldhelm&#x27;s Head in his honour.

Aldhelm was revered as a saint after his death, with his feast day being celebrated on 25 May. His relics were translated in 980 by Dunstan, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He is commemorated by a statue in niche 124 of the West Front of Salisbury Cathedral. There is also a statue in Sherborne Abbey of Aldhelm, created in 2004 by Marzia Colonna.

Aldhelm&#x27;s flag may be flown in his celebration. The flag, a white cross on a red background, is a colour reversed version of England&#x27;s St. George flag.

Aldhelm is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 25 May.

In 2023, a pastoral area of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Clifton was named in honour of Aldhelm.

==Writings==
Aldhelm&#x27;s collected works were edited by Rudolf Ehwald, &quot;Aldhelmi opera&quot; (Berlin, 1919). An earlier edition by J. A. Giles, &quot;Patres eccl. Angl.&quot; (Oxford, 1844) was reprinted by J. P. Migne in his &quot;Patrologiae Cursus,&quot; vol. 89 (1850).

===Contemporary reputation===
Aldhelm&#x27;s fame as a scholar spread to other countries. Artwil, the son of an Irish king, submitted his writings for Aldhelm&#x27;s approval, and Cellanus, an Irish monk from Peronne, was one of his correspondents. Aldhelm was the first Anglo-Saxon, so far as is known, to write in Latin verse, and his letter to Acircius (Aldfrith or Eadfrith, king of Northumbria) is a treatise on Latin prosody for the use of his countrymen. In this work he included his most famous productions, one hundred and one riddles in Latin hexameters. Each of them is a complete picture, and one of them, &quot;De creatura&quot;, runs to 83 lines.

That Aldhelm&#x27;s merits as a scholar were early recognised in his own country is shown by the encomium of Bede (&quot;Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum&quot; 5.18), who speaks of him as a wonder of erudition. His fame reached Italy, and at the request of Pope Sergius I he paid a visit to Rome, of which, however, there is no notice in his extant writings. On his return, bringing with him privileges for his monastery and a magnificent altar, he received a popular ovation.

Aldhelm wrote in elaborate, grandiloquent and very difficult Latin, known as hermeneutic style. This &quot;verborum garrulitas&quot; shows the influence of Irish models and became England&#x27;s dominant Latin style for centuries, though eventually it came to be regarded as barbarous. His works became standard school texts in monastic schools, until his influence declined around the time of the Norman Conquest.

===Modern reputation===
Modern historians have contrasting views of his writings. Peter Hunter Blair compares him unfavourably to Bede: &quot;In the mind of his older contemporary, Aldhelm, learning of equal depth produced little more than an extravagant form of intellectual curiosity...Like Bede he drank deeply from the streams of Irish and Mediterranean scholarship, but their waters produced in him a state of intellectual intoxication which delighted its beholders, but which left little to posterity.&quot; However, Michael Lapidge praises his immense learning, observing that his knowledge of Latin texts is greater than any other pre-Conquest Anglo-Saxon writer, and that &quot;the originality and importance of his corpus of Latin writings well justifies his status as the first English man of letters&quot;.

===Prose===
*De Laude Virginitatis (the prose &quot;De Virginitate&quot;), a Latin treatise on virginity addressed to the nuns of the double monastery at Barking, is Aldhelm&#x27;s best-known work. After a long preface extolling the merits of virginity, he commemorates a great number of male and female saints. Aldhelm later wrote a shorter, poetic version (see below).
*Epistola ad Acircium, a Latin treatise dedicated to one Acircius, understood to be King Aldfrith of Northumbria (r. 685-704/5). The chief source of his &quot;Epistola ad Acircium&quot; (ed. A. Mai, &quot;Class. Auct.&quot; vol. V) is Priscian. The acrostic introduction gives the sentence, &#x27;Aldhelmus cecinit millenis versibus odas,&#x27; whether read from the initial or final letters of the lines. After an address to King Aldfrith, the letter consists of three treatises:
**&quot;De septenario&quot;, treatise on the number seven in arithmology
**&quot;De metris&quot;, treatise on metre, including the &quot;Enigmata&quot; (see below).
**&quot;De pedum regulis&quot;, didactive treatise on metrical feet, such as iambs and spondees.
*Epistola ad Geruntium, a letter written in Latin to Geraint, King of Dumnonia concerning articles of the Council of Hertford. It was supposed to have been destroyed by the Britons (William of Malmesbury, &quot;Gesta pontificum Anglorum&quot; p. 361), but was discovered with others of Aldhelm&#x27;s in the correspondence of St Boniface, archbishop of Mainz.
*Other Letters. Correspondents include Bishop Leuthere, Hadrian, Eahfrid, Cellanus, Sergius and Aldhelm&#x27;s pupils Wihtfrith and Æthelwald who was responsible for part of the &quot;Carmen Rhythmicum&quot;.
**A long letter to Eahfrid, a scholar just returned from Ireland (first printed in Usher, &quot;Veterum Epistt. Hiber. Sylloge,&quot; 1632), is of interest as casting light on the relations between English and Irish scholars.

===Poetry===
*Carmen de virginitate (the poetic &quot;De Virginitate&quot;). Aldhelm wrote a shorter, poetic version of &quot;De Laude Virginitatis&quot;, which closes with a battle of the virtues against the vices, the &quot;De octo principalibus vitiis&quot; (first printed by Delrio, Mainz, 1601). The two works are what is sometimes called an &quot;opus geminatum&quot; or &quot;twin work&quot;.
*Carmen Rhythmicum, rhythmic poem which describes a travel through western England and the way a wooden church was affected by a storm.
*Carmina ecclesiastica (modern title), i.e. a number of Latin &quot;tituli&quot; designed for inscription on a church or altar. They are: (1) &quot;In Basilica Sanctorum Petri et Pauli&quot;, for a church dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, possibly the church which Aldhelm founded at Malmesbury, (2) &quot;In Basilica Beatae Mariae Semper Virginis&quot;, St Mary&#x27;s Church, possibly also at Malmesbury, (3) &quot;In Ecclesia Mariae a Bugge Extructa&quot;, for the church built by Bugga, that is Eadburh of Minster-in-Thanet, a royal lady of the house of Wessex, (4) the twelve &quot;tituli&quot; known collectively as &quot;In Duodecim Apostolorum Aris&quot; and (5) &quot;In sancti Matthiae Apostoli Ecclesia&quot;.
*Aenigmata, one hundred riddles included in the &quot;Epistola ad Acircium&quot;.

===Lost works===
According to William of Malmesbury, Aldhelm also wrote poetry in Old English and set his own compositions to music, but none of his songs, which were still popular in the time of Alfred, have survived. Finding his people slow to come to church, he is said to have stood at the end of a bridge singing songs in the vernacular, thus collecting a crowd to listen to exhortations on sacred subjects.

<text>In Lakota tradition, Škaŋ is the Motion of the universe. The Great Spirit, Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka, reflected upon himself and created the four Superior Spirits, Wi (the first to be created, bringing light to the world), Skan, Maka (Mother Earth) and Íŋyaŋ (the solid support of the Earth or the rock associated with the natural forces of the Earth). In the beginning, Wakáŋ Taŋka, The Great Mystery, reflected upon itself and created the four Superior Spirits. The first was Inyan, the Rock. Íŋyaŋ created a companion, Makhá, the earth. Then Sky, or Škaŋ, was created to wrap around the first two. All was still dark, so lastly Wí, the Sun, was created to give light.

Škaŋ is the source of all animated life. All things have a spirit, and this spirit is given to it by Škaŋ when the thing is created. These spirits come from the stars. When a thing dies, the spirits return to Skan and the stars.

<text>Sherborne Abbey, otherwise the Abbey Church of St. Mary the Virgin, is a Church of England church in Sherborne in the English county of Dorset. It has been a Saxon cathedral (705–1075), a Benedictine abbey church (998–1539), and since 1539, a parish church.

== History ==
This site has been occupied since Roman times. During the restoration of 1849–58, excavations were carried out in which part of a Roman mosaic pavement was found deep beneath the floor, as well as evidence that the Saxon cathedral of AD 705 had been built on the site of a previous church.

It is possible that there was a Celtic Christian church called &quot;Lanprobi&quot; here as early as AD 658, when it was part of the Celtic kingdom of Dumnonia, and Kenwalc or Cenwalh, King of the West Saxons, is believed to be one of its founders. However, it is probable that this church was actually on the site of modern-day Castleton Church.

=== Cathedral (705–1075) and abbey (998–1539) ===
The Saxon Diocese of Sherborne was founded in 705 by King Ine of Wessex to relieve pressure from the growing see of Winchester. He set Aldhelm as first bishop of the see of Western Wessex, covering Dorset, Somerset, Devon, with his seat at Sherborne. Aldhelm was the first of 27 bishops of Sherborne. Cornwall was added to the diocese at the end of the ninth century, but in 909 the diocese was divided in three to create the new bishoprics of Wells, covering Somerset, and Crediton, covering Devon and Cornwall, leaving Sherborne with Dorset.

The twentieth bishop was Wulfsige III (or St. Wulfsin). In 998 he established a Benedictine abbey at Sherborne and became its first abbot. In 1058, the Sherborne chapter elected Herman, Bishop of Ramsbury, to be also Bishop of Sherborne. In 1075, Herman unified his two bishoprics into a single see with its seat at Old Sarum, so Sherborne remained an abbey church but was no longer a cathedral. The bishop (in Old Sarum) remained the nominal head of the abbey until 1122, when Roger de Caen, Bishop of Salisbury, made the abbey independent.

From 1122 until dissolution, Horton Priory (founded as a Benedictine abbey in 961, but reduced to priory status when the bishopric moved) was dependent on Sherborne. Also, Kidwelly Priory (later abbey) in Wales was made a cell of Sherborne Abbey, which was at that time a cathedral priory, c.1110 and was dissolved at the same time as its mother-house.

=== Parish church ===
The Benedictine foundation at Sherborne ended in the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539, when the abbey was surrendered to King Henry VIII. Various properties at Sherborne were bought from the king by Sir John Horsey, who then sold the abbey to the people of Sherborne, who bought the building to be their parish church (as people of many other places did), which it still is. The original parish church alongside the abbey was demolished, although the foundations are still visible. In 1550, King Edward VI issued a new charter to the school that had existed at Sherborne since 705, and some of the remaining abbey buildings were turned over to it.

== Architecture ==
The abbey is a Grade I listed building. It has several distinct architectural styles throughout.

=== Saxon ===
When St Aldhelm built his cathedral (starting after about 705, and prior to his 709 decease), it was to the west of the current building – the west wall of the current church is the site of the east wall of St Aldhelm&#x27;s. In c.1050 Bishop Ælfwold II built a new cathedral and abbey church on the current site that was, apparently, one of the largest in England. Of this, the known surviving parts are the west wall and the core of the columns supporting the two westernmost arches. At the west end of the north aisle, a Saxon doorway from c.1050 survives. This would have led into a large porch flanking a west tower as was conventional with Saxon church-architecture. Roger of Caen rebuilt much of Ælfwold II&#x27;s church c.1130, replacing it with a much larger Norman-style church on the same site, completed c.1180. This is the reason why the nave is shorter (only five bays) than the typical Anglo-Norman church nave.

=== Norman ===
Most of the walls of the crossing, the north and south transepts, and the outer walls of the nave aisles date from c.1140. The walls of the Wykeham Chapel, and some of the wall of the north quire aisle were also built at this time. The entrance porch dates from c.1180, though the upper story was restored in 1851. The Norman choir stalls extended west of the central tower (as was then usually the case) and this can be seen in the stonework of the east and west tower arches were the shafts stop short of the floor to allow space for the stall-work. The area of the nave west of the Norman quire was used as the parish church until the building of All Hallows&#x27; Church later on.

=== Early English ===
The outer walls of Bishop Roger&#x27;s Chapel (now the choir vestry) as well as the remains of the old Lady Chapel date from this period, c.1240.

=== Decorated ===
In the mid-14th century St Aldhelm&#x27;s church was pulled down and in c.1360 a new chapel-of-ease was built, dedicated All Hallows. This church was demolished c.1542, but the arches of the old nave can be seen projecting out, and the wall of the old north aisle remains intact.

=== Perpendicular ===
From c.1380 to 1500 the abbey was greatly rebuilt. In the late 14th century the chapels of St Katherine and St Sepulchre were built. The former was altered in the 15th century and contains examples of early Renaissance classicism architecture. The rebuilding was started by Abbot Robert Brunyng. The quire was almost entirely rebuilt from 1425 and was completed (including the vaulting) around 1430. In the late 15th century much of the old stonework in the nave was covered over in stonework of this style (hence their substantial thickness) and the two easternmost arch pillars were rebuilt. The fan-vaulting in the nave, by William Smyth, was finished around 1490. A consequence of having the new Perpendicular clerestory sit atop the old Norman pillars is that the two do not line up. However, this is not really noticeable from the outside.

In 1437, during this renovation, a riot in the town caused a fire that damaged much of the work. The heat brought out the iron in the stone, resulting in pink seen today. The outline of the medieval pulpitum can be seen where the pink stops in a vertical line at the east end of the nave. The fire and its effects also caused the design of the nave to be altered.

A section of a 15th century wooden screen from the abbey is now located at the church in Sandford Orcas, Dorset.

=== Restoration ===
The abbey was heavily restored by the Victorian architect R.C. Carpenter in 1850, who added the two lower rows of lights in the west window, and the &quot;somewhat fanciful&quot; neo-Norman upper storey of the porch, which formerly had 15th-century windows.

== Lady Chapel ==
The Lady Chapel is on the site of two earlier chapels: the c.1250 then Lady Chapel and the c.15 Chapel of St. Mary le Bow. These were taken over by the governors of the newly founded &#x27;Edward VI Grammar School&#x27; (now known as Sherborne School) in 1550 and were partially demolished and converted into a dwelling for the headmaster in 1560. It remained in use by the school until 1921 when plans were drawn for the grafting of a new Gothic-style Lady Chapel onto the remaining section of the medieval chapel and was completed in 1934. The original Lady Chapel was built slightly south of the centre of the church, so the 15th century vaulting in the ambulatory does not align with the arch into the chapel. The remaining section of St. Mary le Bow&#x27;s Chapel contains a fireplace mantel from when it was a domestic dwelling.

The Lady Chapel contains the oldest candelabrum in England, dating from 1657, and probably came from the Netherlands. It is brass with a double-headed eagle at the top, and two tiers of branches and a globe beneath. The globe is inscribed recording the gift of Sherborne grandee, Mary Whetcumbe, with a shield-of-arms. Originally, it hung in the presbytery, but it fell during the Second World War. In 1962 it was restored and rehung in the Lady Chapel.

== Almshouses ==

=== St Thomas&#x27; Hospital ===
The first almshouse at Sherborne, the Hospital of St. Thomas Becket (or St Thomas-a-Becket&#x27;s Chapel), existed in 1228, though its foundation date is not known. It was probably a royal foundation and was situated on the site of what is now &#x27;The Old Green&#x27;, formerly &#x27;The Angel Inn&#x27;. In the early 16th century it was still standing but disused and by 1547 it had been pulled down.

==== Wardens of the St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital ====
1395 John de Wendelyngburgh (died in the same year)

1395 Nicholas Slake

1405 John Brunyng (later Abbot of Sherborne)

1540 John Horsey (purchased along with the abbey after the reformation)

=== St Julian&#x27;s Hospice ===
The Hospice of St Julian, possibly named after St. Julian of Norwich, was founded on the east side of The Green in c1405 (along with the &#x27;George Inne&#x27;). It was given towards the endowment of the St Johns&#x27; Almshouse in 1437 and remains in their ownership today. The George Inn was rebuilt in the 16th century, but the hospice and passageway are largely original. It is now used as a shop.

=== St Johns&#x27; Almshouse ===
In 1406, William Dodill chartered a new almshouse situated in Hound Street. However, by the 1430s larger and better premises were needed, so a new Sherborne almshouse was started by the old trustees of Dodill&#x27;s almshouse. In 1436/7 a Royal charter was issued by King Henry VI to the Foundation, and this became the first fully licensed corporation in Sherborne.

The site of this new almshouse – St Johns&#x27; Almshouse, or fully, &quot;The Hospital of St. John the Baptist and St. John the Evangelist&quot; – is the south west corner of the Abbey Close, probably on the site of an earlier hospital of St Augustine. The building was completed in 1448, consisting of a chapel (1442), ante-chapel with a door onto Trendle street, a dining hall, and dormitories above. It is the best surviving example of a medieval almshouse in Wessex. In 1858 some cottages in the Abbey Close were purchased and demolished so that the premises could be enlarged. In 1866 the east wing was built to create additional dormitories and a room with an oriel window called the board-room, together with other improvements.

In the 15th century, the abbey already had an almshouse situated at Castleton (demolished in the 18th century), so it is likely that this building was for All Hallows Church (c.1360), not the abbey. Also, it is unusual for an almshouse to be so close to its respective church, and a possible reason may be that it was symbolic of the parishioners&#x27; growing resentment towards the monks for restricting their use of the abbey. However, this idea is difficult to substantiate.

==== Masters of the almshouse ====
1448 John Deen

1454 William Smyth

1468 Henry Borman

== Monastic buildings ==
Some of the monastic buildings were demolished following the Reformation in 1539. Most of those that remained are now incorporated into the Sherborne School buildings.

=== Cloisters ===
The principal buildings of a Benedictine abbey were always grouped around the cloister garth. They are usually built to the south of their respective abbey, but at Sherborne they were built to the north, probably for easier access to water from the Coombe Stream.

Sherborne&#x27;s cloisters were built by Abbot Frith (1348–1373) and this is where the monks took their exercise, walking around the square arcade, in silence, with their hands buried in the long sleeves of their black habits.

The remains of the 14th-century pilasters against the south and west walls of the cloisters remain from which the ribs of the vaulted roof once sprang. On each side of the cloister were eight bays with six windows looking into the garth.

Some time around 1553 the cloisters were pulled down and in 1569 two large buttresses were built to support the abbey (one on the west wall of the north transept, the other on the north wall of the north aisle) and were built using stone from the old castle.

=== Conduit ===
In the 12th century the monks built an open stone conduit or channel to bring clean water from the spring at New Well (Newell) to the cloister so that they could wash their hands and faces before going to the Refectory for their meals. A conduit house was built c.1520 by Abbot Meere (1505–1535) over the fountain. This hexagonal structure stood against the north alley of the cloister, opposite the entrance to the monks&#x27; refectory, and had several spouts to enable a number of monks to wash at once. In 1553 the conduit house and water supply were moved to the market place at the bottom of Cheap Street.

=== Slype ===

Owned by Sherborne School since 1550, the slype is a lean-to building against the north transept. It is all that remains of the former south bay of the monks&#x27; dormitory. Originally it led from the cloister to the infirmary and monks&#x27; graveyard. It was probably also used in part as a mortuary. The western door was blocked by a buttress built in 1569. It contains 12th-century arcading and 13th-century engrafted arch and vaulting.

=== Chapter house ===
On the ground floor of the east side of the cloister stood the chapter house. Built in the late 12th–13th century, it was used as a daily meeting chamber for the monks. It was demolished c.1557/8.

Archaeological excavations between 1972 and 1976 revealed the east cloister range and the chapter house, the remains of which are now stored in the Sherborne School Archives.

=== Monks&#x27; dormitory ===
On the first floor of the east side of the cloister stood the monks&#x27; dormitory (late 12th century), adjoining the abbey for the convenience of attending night services in the abbey. By 1554 all that remained of the dormitory was just one bay (see &#x27;the slype&#x27;). The pitch of the old roof is clearly marked on the face of the north wall of the north transept.

The monastery library and scriptorium were probably also on this floor.

=== Guesten hall ===
This was in the west cloister range of the monastery. The ground floor was the cellarer&#x27;s store room and outer parlour. Originally it had no windows but facsimiles of windows in Boxgrove Abbey were added. On the first floor was the guesten hall (13th century with 15th century roof and windows). The three roof bays to the north are not as ornate as the remaining six, which suggests that, at a time, the room may have been either divided into two by partition, or there could have been a gallery – possibly a minstrel gallery or perhaps to separate different classes of guest.

In the south wall are the remains of the east face of the west wall of the Saxon Abbey (10th–11th century plinth, with 13th century work on top). Behind this is a late 14th century stone spiral staircase that originally led to the abbot&#x27;s private chapel on the upper floor of the south cloister range.

An archaeological dig in 1967 revealed a pottery kiln built into the west wall, and from 1740 the main body of the building was used as a silk mill.

It is now used as the Sherborne School Library building.

Note: There is no definite evidence that this room was used as a &#x27;guesten hall&#x27;, though in Benedictine monasteries it was not unusual to have a room such as this above a cellarium on the west side of the cloisters. Others have suggested that it may have been a misericorde (the room in which some monastic rules were relaxed, especially fasting) where more substantial food was supplied than in the refectory. A room such as this might have had a buttery, which can explain the less ornate section of roof. It has also been suggested that it could have been a domus conversorum (&#x27;house of the converts&#x27;. Until 1280, people who converted from Judaism to Christianity forfeited their possessions to the Crown), but there is little to suggest that that such members were ever numerous enough to justify such a large room, nor are there any traces of separate cells.

=== Abbot&#x27;s private chapel ===
On the first floor, to the west of the south cloister side stood the abbot&#x27;s private chapel. It was accessed by an extant late 14th century stone spiral staircase, which also led to the guesten hall. The blocked doorway can still be seen in the outside east wall of the building.

The piscina (a perforated stone basin near the altar for carrying away holy water after it has been used in rinsing the chalice) can still be seen on the north aisle wall of the abbey.

=== Abbot&#x27;s hall ===
This room, including the roof, dates from the early 15th century, but the windows are modern. It is mentioned in 1436 when Bishop Neville made an enquiry into the well-known quarrel between the monks and the townspeople.

The 12th-century undercroft would have been used by the monks as the cellars, a malthouse, or for storage.

It is now used as the Sherborne School Chapel. It has been much extended and bears little resemblance to it its original size.

=== Abbot&#x27;s lodgings and monks&#x27; kitchen ===
On the north side of the cloisters stood the abbot&#x27;s lodging and monk&#x27;s kitchen, built c.1480 by Abbot Ramsam (1475–1504). The large chimney stack of the kitchen remains, and on the north wall there are panels carved with the symbols of the Evangelists.

The abbot&#x27;s northern entrance would have been to the right of the projecting octagonal block, or stair turret, which led to the abbot&#x27;s parlour above. On the roof are some fine gargoyles like those on the abbey.

=== Refectory ===
The refectory stood on the north side of the cloisters, filling in the space between the abbot&#x27;s Hall and the monks&#x27; dormitory to make a quadrangle, and was where the monks ate their meals. Access from the ground floor was opposite the conduit house, and there was most likely access into the kitchen. The refectory may have been built at the same time as the dormitory, late C12, and it was demolished at the same time, in 1554. The stones from the refectory are thought to have been used to build the original &#x27;scholehouse&#x27; for the king&#x27;s school which had been given a royal charter only four years earlier.

== All Hallows&#x27; Church ==
The nave of the abbey, west of the Norman quire, was for many years used as the parish church, while the monks kept the crossing and east end of the church for their own use. However, in the 14th century, a large church dedicated to All Saints, or more commonly known as &#x27;Alhalowes&#x27;, was built at the west end of the Abbey Church as a chapel-of-ease for the townsfolk. The west porch and west tower were pulled down to the floor-level of the new church (which was about two feet above the level of the Abbey Church floor) and the new church was constructed on the site of the old St Aldhelm cathedral, completed c.1360.

This church had a nave flanked by an aisle either side, each six bays long. There was a small chapel at the north and south sides (respectively) of the east end. At this time, there was no west door into the abbey (inserted 1543) and the easternmost bay acted as an ambulatory for the abbey. The remaining five bays were used for worship in All Hallows. From old Parish Accounts, we learn that there was a tower at the north west corner, with a ring of bells, and there is also reference to an organ.

In 1450 Bishop Beauchamp confirmed that the status of All Hallows should rise from chapel-of-ease to that of parish church. In c.1542 the church was demolished, following the dissolution of the abbey in 1539, as St. Mary&#x27;s became the parish church of Sherborne. The remains of the All Hallows font are now in the St. Mary le Bow Chapel, and most of the bells were transferred to the abbey tower.

== 1437 riot ==
By 1437 all parish services were held in All Hallows&#x27; Church. The exception being baptisms which were conducted at the font in the abbey nave because All Hallows, being a chapel-of-ease, was not legally entitled to a font of its own. This continued until the monks, during their reconstruction of the abbey, moved the font from its usual position in the nave, and narrowed the doorway giving access to the nave from All Hallows hindering the baptismal processions. In response to this, the townspeople built their own font in All Hallows.

Once learning of this, Abbot Bradford complained to Bishop Neville that the parishioners had built an illegal font in All Hallows, and the monks were also complaining that the parishioners were ringing the All Hallows&#x27; bells very early in the morning disturbing their sleep after their long night offices. Tensions continued to increase and there were more confrontations between the monks and parishioners in 1436.

Robert Neville, Bishop of Salisbury, held an inquiry soon after in an attempt to reconcile the dispute, ultimately taking the side of the parishioners – the monks had arbitrarily disrupted their baptismal processions by moving the font and obstructing the door to the nave.

Six weeks after the hearing Bishop Neville ordered the illegal font in All Hallows to be destroyed and removed, and the bells of All Hallows not to ring before 6 a.m., except on the four great feasts of the year. He ordered the monks to move the abbey font back to its ancient position and to widen the door they had narrowed. Finally, the monks were to build a wall or partition at the expense of the monastery, so that there should be a distinct separation between the monks and parishioners. He gave the monks until the following Christmas (almost a year) to carry out these orders. However, the orders were never carried out except for the building of the partition – a large stone pulpitum, 18 feet high and 5 feet wide, on the west side of the crossing, removed during the 1850s restoration.

The dispute simmered through the spring and summer of 1437, and boiled over after the Abbot sent a &#x27;stout butcher&#x27; to smash the new All Hallows font. Infuriated by the destruction of the new font, the townspeople retaliated, and on the night of 28 October 1437 one of their priests, Richard Vowells, fired an arrow with a burning tip into the temporary thatch roof of the new quire, causing a huge fire from the burning roof and wooden scaffolding and much damage to the new construction, even melting the tower&#x27;s lead roof and the bells. The heat brought out the iron in the stone, resulting in it being permanently reddened. The fire seems to have been contained only to the quire and tower; the nave and lady chapel were not significantly affected. In the end, the Pope was needed to settle the conflict and the townspeople were forced to contribute to the repairs of St. Mary&#x27;s Church which they had destroyed.

After this, All Hallows &quot;Chapel&quot; became the parish &quot;church&quot; and even when St. Mary&#x27;s was finally rebuilt, the parishioners continued to use All Hallows as their parish church until the abbey&#x27;s dissolution in 1539.

== Military colours ==

The north nave aisle, sometimes called the &#x27;Trinitie&#x27; or &#x27;dark&#x27; aisle (as it was overshadowed by the adjoining cloisters), contains several colours from the 2nd Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment and the Dorsetshire Militia. The south nave aisle contains colours of the 1st Battalion Dorsetshire Regiment.

== Memorials and tombs ==

The north choir aisle contains two tombs, believed to be the tombs of King Æthelbald of Wessex and his brother King Ethelbert of Wessex, elder brothers to Alfred the Great.

Inside the Wykeham chapel is the tomb of Sir John Horsey and his son. Horsey had bought the church after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and sold it to the townspeople. Also in the chapel is the plainly marked tomb of the poet Sir Thomas Wyatt.

The south transept contains an impressive baroque memorial to John Digby, 3rd Earl of Bristol, made of marble and designed by John Nost. Additionally there is a memorial to Robert and Mary Digby.

St Katherine&#x27;s Chapel contains the 16th-century tomb of John Leweston and wife Joan. The chapel was where Sir Walter Raleigh and Lady Raleigh attended services.

The north aisle contains a memorial to Abbot Clement (1163) and an effigy to an unknown prior, while the south aisle contains an effigy of Abbot Lawrence of Bradford (1246).

The Digby Memorial, situated outside the abbey, is a memorial to George Digby who provided a lot of funding for renovation work during the 19th century. It was built in 1884 and features statues of St Aldhelm, Bishop Roger of Salisbury (Roger de Caen), Abbot Bradford and Sir Walter Raleigh.

=== Burials ===
*Æthelbald, King of Wessex
*Æthelberht, King of Wessex
*Thomas Wyatt (poet)
*John Horsey (died 1546)
*John Horsey (died 1564)
*John Leweston
*John Digby, 3rd Earl of Bristol
*William Digby, 5th Baron Digby

== Reredos ==
The abbey has two reredos. The more recent is in the Lady Chapel, and was designed by Laurence Whistler in 1969, and fashioned in glass. The second, more substantial reredos was installed in 1858 and designed by RH Carpenter.

== Windows ==

The abbey contains a number of stained glass windows. The diarist Richard Symonds, post 1664–1665, described the location, blazon and surname for coats of arms of some leading families of Dorset displayed on stained glass in the Sherborne church as he observed them during the marches of the Royal Army during the English Civil War.

The south transept&#x27;s Te Deum window was designed by Pugin in the early 19th century.

The great east window was designed by Clayton and Bell and installed in 1856–58. It features the Apostles Mark, Luke, Matthew and John, and Saints Sidwell and Juthware (Juthwara), who is featured in the Sherborne Missal. The glass in the southern aisle commemorates Sherborne School For Girls&#x27; 1949 jubilee.

The Lady Chapel glass comes from the 1930s, and depicts St Aldhelm presenting a model of his church to the patron.

The great west window is the newest of the major windows designed and made by John Hayward (1929–2007), being installed in 1997 to replace a poor quality, faded, Pugin-conceived glass. The new glass depicts the patron and the baby Jesus, the Biblical Magi and the shepherds, the Genesis story, the fall of man and the Easter story.

== Misericords ==
The abbey contains ten c.1440 misericords, situated five on each side of the choir. From west to east, these are carved as following:

N. side: man with hood and foliage; man gurning; Last Judgement, Resurrection of the dead at sides; man&#x27;s face with foliage; foliage.

S. side: woman praying (possibly St. Margaret), winged monster below, leaves at sides; chained monkey and oak-leaves with acorns; man beating boy, boys at sides; archer shooting a man on horseback, Samson and lion at sides; woman beating man, leaves at sides.

== Bells ==

The C15th central tower contains the heaviest ring of eight bells in the world, with the tenor bell weighing of 46cwt and 5 lbs (5,157 lb or 2,340 kg). A ring should not be confused with a peal, which is a specific type of performance of change ringing.

Since before Norman times the bells were rung from the crossing, directly beneath the tower. Ringing such heavy bells with such long ropes would have taken a lot of effort; it was likely the heavier bells would have each taken two or three men to ring them. In 1858 a new ringing chamber was built just above the tower fan vaulting.
All inscriptions are in upper case and various decorative symbols have been omitted.

=== Notes ===
Seventh: Chimed from the choir each week as a call to morning prayer. Called the &quot;Lady bell&quot;

Tenor: This is the smallest of seven bells from Tournai, Belgium presented to English churches in 1514 by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey (1473–1530). This bell is known as Great Tom, after Thomas Wolsey. Though this bell was the smallest of the seven, it is the largest bell rung in a peal in England. The other six were given to the following churches in order of size: Christ Church, Oxford; Exeter; St Paul&#x27;s; Lincoln: Canterbury and; Gloucester.

Sanctus: Chimed at the blessing of the sanctum during Communion.

Fire bell: It is unusual in that it has an in-turned lip, and so has a completely different sound to a conventional bell. However, it stopped being used in 1863.

The last restoration was carried out in 1995 by Nicholson Engineering of Bridport. This included the replacement of headstocks, bearings, wheels, pulley assemblies, clappers, stays and sliders, and the removal of the cast-in crown staples.

=== All Hallows bells ===
By the end of the 14th century, a ring of five or six bells was in use in All Hallows Parish Church, with the earliest known dating from 1514. Most of these were then transferred to the abbey tower.

== Organ ==
The abbey&#x27;s organ, located in the north transept, was installed in 1856 by Gray &amp; Davison to some considerable acclaim. It was completely rebuilt in 1955 by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd with a remote console in the crossing and a large specification. In 1972 John Coulson of Bristol again altered the organ by adding a neo-classically styled &#x27;positiv&#x27; in place of the choir manual, some big mixtures on the great, solo mutations on the choir, and increased wind pressures throughout. By 1987 an increasing lack of reliability led to a proposed scheme by Bishop &amp; Son of Ipswich, favouring a return to the Gray &amp; Davison past by almost halving the number of stops, returning the console to the organ loft – attached to the case – and altering the choir division into more of a bombarde to try to overcome the difficulties of the position of the organ. After just over twenty years it was necessary for the organ to be rebuilt again, and in 2004/05 Kenneth Tickell changed the tonal quality of the instrument, installed new ranks in the choir and swell divisions, and provided a new solution to the location issue by installing a new nave division, located under the west window.

Despite these numerous alterations, much of the pedal division, some of the choir flutes and clarinet, all except the mixture on the great, and much of the chorus swell are original Gray &amp; Davison stops.

<text>In Lakota mythology, Iya is a storm-monster, brother of Iktomi the spider. He eats humans, animals and consumes villages to satisfy his otherwise endless appetite. He is in fact considered a demon in various traditions. The tornado, the snowstorm, the hurricane or the thunderstorm would all be considered manifestations of this deity. He travels with his storms in a tipi painted with magical symbols, and when he appears, he is often faceless and formless. His home is said to be under the waters, where he resides with his mother, Unk.

He is considered to be the chief of the North, symbolically encompassing the spheres of winter, famine and disease. He is the guardian of the Aurora Borealis and holds to a rivalry against both the chief of the South, Okaga, as well as the thunderbirds, though this is vastly exaggerated in tales told to outsiders.

He is the younger brother of Iktomi, and the pair comprises the two progeny of Inyan, the creator, who is the head of the Lakota pantheon.

<text>In Lakota mythology, Iktómi is a spider-trickster spirit, and a culture hero for the Lakota people. Alternate names for Iktómi include Ikto, Ictinike, Inktomi, Unktome, and Unktomi. These names are due to the differences in languages between different indigenous nations, as this spider deity was known throughout many of North America&#x27;s tribes.

His appearance is that of a spider, but he can take any shape, including that of a human. When he is a human he is said to wear red, yellow and white paint, with black rings around his eyes.

==Story==

The Spider, although most tales involve the trickster figure and center on morality lessons for the young, Iktómi was also the bringer of Lakota culture. He is the first born son of Inyan, the Rock. He was originally called Ksa. According to author James Walker, Iktómi has his roots in Ksa, the god of wisdom: &quot;Because Ksa had used his wisdom to cause a goddess to hide her face in shame and a god to bow his head in grief, Scan, the god of motion condemned him that he should sit at the feasts of gods no more and should sit on the world without a friend, and his wisdom should be only cunning that would entrap him in his own schemes. He named him Iktómi. So Iktómi is the imp of mischief whose delight is to make others ridiculous&quot;. The Oglala of south Dakota present Iktómi as the second manifestation, or degeneration, of Ksa, which hatched from the Cosmic Egg being laid by Wak-Inyan, the primordial thunderstorm. Ksa invented language, stories, names and games. In another version Iya is the son of Unk (defined as passion), who detested Ksa. Iya and Unk had an incestious relationship out of which Gnaski, the demon, was the result. Because of this, and for not taking the advice of Ksa, Unk was expelled from the circle of divine entities. Unk wanted to outwit Ksa with the help of the cunning of Gnaski. Gnaski succeeds in this, mainly because he has no fear of Skan (the Judge, Activity), by sowing confusion. Gnaski enabled this by mimicking Ksa to perfection; therefore, Gnaski is called Ksapela (little wisdom). The first people were not able to distinguish between the two. Through his folly Gnaski entangles Ksa completely, and through the activity of Skan Ksa consequently becomes a spider, the meaning of the name Iktómi.

Iktómi still had the feature of making games. It seems that Iktómi, in stories attributed to him, in his very essence is representing the confusion between wisdom and folly. He began playing malicious tricks because people would jeer at his strange or funny looks. Most of his schemes end with him falling into ruin when his intricate plans backfire. Because it is Iktómi, a respected (or perhaps feared) deity playing the part of the idiot or fool, and the story is told as entertainment, the listener is allowed to reflect on misdeeds without feeling like they are being confronted. In other tales, Iktómi is depicted with dignity and seriousness, such as in the popularized myth of the dreamcatcher.

Iktómi is a shapeshifter, and can use strings to control humans like puppets. He has also the power to make potions that change gods, gain control over people and trick gods and mortals. Mica or Coyote is his great accomplice in all of this, though there are times when he behaves seriously and comes to the aid of the Lakota people, there are instances where he gives the people ways to protect themselves from evil, live a better life with technology, or warn them of danger.

==Interpretations==
The tales of Iktómi&#x27;s propensity for mischief leads many without a full understanding of Native American mythology to believe that he is an evil figure. However, it is not quite that simple. Iktómi can be seen as both good and bad, and has been portrayed in both ways. Many other Native American tricksters, like Mica (Coyote) are often victims of the same misconception. Despite Lakota not expressing hysteria or extreme fear towards Iktómi, generally he is viewed as a being whose gaze is to be avoided, lest trouble find you.

The picture of a spider, of Iktómi, could be used as love magic: by it, the souls of a boy and a girl could be caught and connected. In this case they cannot escape meeting and falling in love. Lame Deer tells a story in which Iktómi saw a group of ducks. He wanted to eat them and that is why he lied that his bag is full of pou-wow songs. The ducks asked him to sing some of them. He agrees, but only if they close their eyes. So he started killing them, while some realized what was happening. Iktómi, says Lame Deer, is like those of the politicians who make us close our eyes, sing and dance for them while they hit us on the head. 

Because the Lakota mythology is word of mouth, and traditionally there were no written records, most of the information about Iktómi in Lakota mythology has not been written down or recorded. He has lived on in the retelling of tales and the religious traditions which are passed on from generation to generation, into the modern day.

==In popular culture==
* In Bryan Fuller&#x27;s adaptation on Starz of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;American Gods&quot;, Iktómi appears briefly in Season 2 (residing in the &quot;Corn Palace,&quot; a roadside grow-op) to provide a mysterious plant and the disassembled Gungnir to an Ifreet. He also appears in the book, but as Wisakedjak or &quot;Whiskey Jack&quot;.
* Sioux author Zitkála-Šá, also known by the missionary-given and later married name Gertrude Simmons Bonnin, included tales of Iktómi in her &quot;Old Indian Legends&quot;, published by Ginn and Company, Boston, in 1901.
* In the Netflix sitcom &quot;Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt&quot;, Iktómi is referenced on multiple occasions, as part of a season 3 plot between Jacqueline White and Russ Snyder.
* Iktómi is portrayed in the 2002 film &quot;Skins&quot;, directed by Cheyenne-Arapaho director Chris Eyre.
* The ill-fated ship in the 2016 PC game &quot;Tharsis&quot; is named Iktómi.
* He has appeared multiple times in the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; video game series and its spinoffs as a demon under the name Ictinike. He was first introduced in the 1995 game &quot;Devil Summoner&quot;, and has since appeared in &quot;Devil Children: Book of Fire&quot; and &quot;Book of Ice&quot;, &quot;Devil Survivor 2&quot;, &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV&quot;, and &quot;Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse&quot;. Ictinike is almost always classified as a &quot;genma,&quot; a category of demons typically reserved for legendary heroes.

<text>Inktomi Corporation was an American Internet service provider (ISP) software developer based in Foster City, California. Customers included Microsoft, HotBot, Amazon.com, eBay, and Walmart.

The company developed Traffic Server, a proxy server web cache for World Wide Web traffic and on-demand streaming media which transcoded images down to a smaller size for users of dial-up Internet access. Traffic Server was deployed by several large ISPs including AOL.

In 2003, after the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the company was acquired by Yahoo! for $241 million.

The company&#x27;s name, pronounced &quot;INK-tuh-me&quot;, was derived from a Lakota legend about the trickster spider Iktomi, known for his ability to outsmart larger adversaries. The tri-color nested cube logo was created by Tom Lamar in 1996.

==History==
Inktomi was founded in January 1996 by University of California, Berkeley professor Eric Brewer and graduate student Paul Gauthier at the University of California, Berkeley. The company was initially founded based on the web search engine that was developed at the university. HotBot was the first search engine that made use of Inktomi&#x27;s search technology.

=== 1998 to 1999 ===
In June 1998, the company raised $36 million in an initial public offering. Its success in making HotBot the top rated search engine led to Microsoft, Yahoo! and Disney all partnering with Inktomi.

In September 1998, the company acquired C2B Technologies for $95 million in stock, adding shopping engine technology to its portfolio.

In November 1998, the company raised additional capital at a 688% premium to its IPO price five months earlier.

In March 1999, CEO David Peterschmidt said that Inktomi would become an &quot;arms merchant&quot; to a growing number of content delivery network service providers. Inktomi received revenue based on a percentage of sales and/or a pay per click model.

In April 1999, the company acquired Impulse Buy Network, adding 400 merchants to its shopping engine.

In November 1999, the company acquired Webspective, which developed technology for content management across a host of distributed servers to be used in load balancing, for $106 million in stock.

=== 21st century ===
In March 2000, the company&#x27;s stock peaked at a price of $241 per share.

In August 2000, the company acquired Ultraseek Server from The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Go.com.

In September 2000, the company acquired FastForward Networks, which developed software for the distribution of live streaming media over the Internet using &quot;app-level&quot; multicast technology, for $1.3 billion in stock.

In December 2000, the company acquired the Content Bridge Business Unit from Adero, a content delivery network, which had formed the Content Bridge Alliance with Inktomi and other ISPs, hosting providers and IP transport providers in August 2000.

An article written by Danny Sullivan for Search Engine Watch on October 1, 2001, revealed that Inktomi accidentally allowed the public to access its database of spam websites, which contained over one million of such sites, through a search result on competing search engine AllTheWeb. The database was found by Brett Tabke, who ran the Search Engine World website.

In July 2001, the company acquired eScene Networks, which developed software that provided an integrated workflow for the management and publishing of video content.

In 2002, after the burst of the dot-com bubble, the company was restructured by Keyur Patel who joined Inktomi as investor, and senior vice president, strategy, marketing and technology.

His restructuring led to the sale of the Ultraseek Server product (renamed Inktomi Enterprise Search) to Verity in late 2002 and the sale of the rest of the company to Yahoo!&#x27;s Yahoo! Search for $1.63 per share, or $241 million, completed on March 19, 2003.

In 2006, the technology behind the Inktomi Proxy Server was acquired by Websense, which was modified and included in the Websense Security Gateway.

In 2009, Yahoo! donated the Traffic Server technology to the Apache Software Foundation.

<text>In Lakota mythology, Wi is one of the most powerful spirits. He is a solar spirit, and is associated with the American Bison. He is the father of Wóȟpe. Anog Ite attempted to seduce Wi, but she had one of her two faces changed into an ugly visage as punishment.

His wife is the lunar goddess, Hanwi. As &quot;Wi&quot; refers to both him and his wife, he is referred as Anpetu Wi (Daytime Wi), while his wife is referred as Hanhepi Wi (Nighttime Wi) to differentiate the two deities.

<text>In Lakota mythology, Wóȟpe (less correctly spelled &quot;Wohpe&quot;) is a spirit of peace, the daughter of Wi and the Moon, Haŋhépi-Wi. She is the wife of the south wind. When she visited the Earth, she gave the Lakota people a pipe as a symbol of peace. Later, Wóȟpe became conflated with White Buffalo Calf Woman. An alternative name for Wóȟpe is Ptehíŋčalasaŋwiŋ. 

As a symbol of Wophe&#x27;s coming to earth she is often associated with falling stars.

<text>In Lakota spirituality, Wakan Tanka (Standard Lakota Orthography: Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka) is the term for the sacred or the divine. This is usually translated as the &quot;Great Spirit&quot; and occasionally as &quot;Great Mystery&quot;.

&quot;Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka&quot; can be interpreted as the power or the sacredness that resides in everything, resembling some animistic and pantheistic beliefs. This term describes every creature and object as &quot;wakȟáŋ&quot; (&quot;holy&quot;) or having aspects that are &quot;wakȟáŋ&quot;. The element &quot;Tanka&quot; or &quot;Tȟáŋka&quot; corresponds to &quot;Great&quot; or &quot;large&quot;.

Before contact with European Christian missionaries, the Lakota used &quot;Wakȟáŋ Tȟáŋka&quot; to refer to an organization or group of sacred entities whose ways were mysterious: thus, &quot;The Great Mystery&quot;. Activist Russell Means also promoted the translation &quot;Great Mystery&quot; and the view that Lakota spirituality is not monotheistic.

==Cognate terms in other languages==

The great battle of the revolt of Cyrus took place 70 km north of Babylon, at Cunaxa (), on the left bank of the Euphrates. The main source is Xenophon, a Greek soldier who participated in the fighting.

==Preparations==
Cyrus gathered an army of Greek mercenaries, consisting of 10,400 hoplites and 2,500 light infantry and peltasts, under the Spartan general Clearchus, and met Artaxerxes at Cunaxa. He also had a large force of levied troops under his second-in-command Ariaeus. The strength of the Achaemenid army was 40,000 men.

When Cyrus learned that his elder brother, the Great King, was approaching with his army, he drew up his army in battle array. He placed the Greek mercenaries on the right, near the river. In addition to this they were supported on their right by some cavalry, 1,000 strong, as was the tradition of battle order in that day. To the Greeks, this was the place of honor. Cyrus himself with 600 body guards was in the center, to the left of the Greek mercenaries—the place where Persian monarchs traditionally placed themselves in the order of battle. Cyrus&#x27; Asiatic troops were on the left flank.

Inversely, Artaxerxes II placed his left on the river, with a unit of cavalry supporting it also. Artaxerxes was in the center of his line, with 6,000 units of Persian cavalry (which were some of the finest in the world) which was to the left of Cyrus, his line being so much the longer. Artaxerxes line overlapped Cyrus&#x27; line quite significantly, since he was able to field many more troops.

Cyrus then approached Clearchus, the leader of the Greeks, who was commanding the phalanx stationed on the right, and ordered him to move into the center so as to go after Artaxerxes. However, Clearchus, not desiring to do this—for fear of his right flank—refused, and promised Cyrus, according to Xenophon, that he would &quot;take care that all would be well&quot;. Cyrus wanted to place him in the center as the Greeks were his most capable unit, and were thereby most able to defeat the elite Persian cavalry and in the process kill the Great King, thereby gaining the Persian throne for Cyrus. Clearchus refused this owing to the insecurity that the Greeks had for their right flank, which tended to drift and was undefended, as the shields were held in the left hand. That Clearchus did not obey this order is a sign of the lack of control that Cyrus had over his army, as a couple of other occasions throughout this campaign prior to the battle reveal also.

Before the final attack began, Xenophon, the main relater of the events at Cunaxa, who was probably at the time some kind of mid-level officer, approached Cyrus to ensure that all the proper orders and dispositions had been made. Cyrus told him that they had, and that the sacrifices that traditionally took place before a battle promised success.

==Battle==

The Greeks, deployed on Cyrus&#x27;s right and outnumbered, charged the left flank of Artaxerxes&#x27; army, which broke ranks and fled before they came within arrowshot. However, on the Persian right the fight between Artaxerxes&#x27; army and Cyrus was far more difficult and protracted. Cyrus personally charged his brother&#x27;s bodyguard and was killed by a javelin, which sent the rebels into retreat. (The man who threw the javelin was known as Mithridates; he would later be executed by scaphism because while drunk at a celebratory feast, he bragged about the kill, offending Artaxerxes, who had initially been grateful and richly rewarded him). Only the Greek mercenaries, who had not heard of Cyrus&#x27;s death and were heavily armed, stood firm. Clearchus advanced against the much larger right wing of Artaxerxes&#x27; army and sent it into retreat. Meanwhile, Artaxerxes&#x27; troops took the Greek encampment and destroyed their food supplies.

==Aftermath==

According to the Greek soldier and writer Xenophon, the Greek heavy troops scattered their opposition twice; only one Greek was even wounded. Only after the battle did they hear that Cyrus himself had been killed, making their victory irrelevant and the expedition a failure. They were in the middle of a very large empire with no food, no employer, and no reliable friends. They offered to make their Persian ally Ariaeus king, but he refused on the grounds that he was not of royal blood and so would not find enough support among the Persians to succeed. They offered their services to Tissaphernes, a leading satrap of Artaxerxes, but he refused them, and they refused to surrender to him. Tissaphernes was left with a problem; a large army of heavy troops, which he could not defeat by frontal assault. He supplied them with food and, after a long wait, led them northwards for home, meanwhile detaching Ariaeus and his light troops from their cause.

The Greek senior officers foolishly accepted the invitation of Tissaphernes to a feast. There they were made prisoner, taken up to the king and there decapitated. The Greeks elected new officers and set out to march northwards to the Black Sea through Corduene and Armenia, to reach the Greek colonies on the shore. Their eventual success, the march of the Ten Thousand, was recorded by Xenophon in his Anabasis.

==Ctesias==
Another famous writer of Antiquity, besides Xenophon, was present at the Battle of Cunaxa. Ctesias, a native of Caria, which belonged to the Achaemenid Empire at the time, was part of the entourage of King Artaxerxes at the Battle of Cunaxa, and brought medical assistance to the king by treating his flesh wound. He reportedly was involved in negotiations with the Greeks after the battle, and also helped their Spartan general Clearchus before his execution. Ctesias was the author of treatises on rivers, and on the Persian revenues, of an account of India entitled &quot;Indica&quot; (Ἰνδικά), and of a history of Assyria and Persia in 23 books, called &quot;Persica&quot; (Περσικά), written in opposition to Herodotus in the Ionic dialect, and professedly founded on the Persian Royal Archives.

<text>Wakíŋyaŋ is a Lakota word for &quot;thunder&quot;. It also may be a portmanteau which associates &quot;wahka&quot; (&quot;sacred&quot;) and &quot;kinyan&quot; (&quot;wings&quot;).

The word is usually translated as &quot;Thunder Spirits&quot;, &quot;Thunder Beings,&quot; or &quot;Thunder Birds&quot;. Heyokas, that is contrarians, dream of Wakinyan and can burn cedar (&quot;Juniperus scopulorum&quot;) to protect themselves from thunder and lightning, since Wakinyan respect trees and will not harm them.

Filmmaker and storm chaser Martin Lisius produced a short film in 2016 titled, &quot;Wakíŋyaŋ&quot; which honors the Lakota &quot;thunder spirit&quot; Wakíŋyaŋ.

<text>In Lakota mythology, Unk Cekula (uŋȟčéǧila or uŋkčéǧila) is a serpentoid creature which was responsible for many unexplained disappearances and deaths. Her male counterpart is known as &quot;Unk Tehi&quot;.

==Description==
She was described at first as having no real shape or form; she had eyes of fire, and a fanged mouth that was shrouded in a smoky or cloudy mass. As time went on further, her form was exposed as being massive, with a long scaly body whose natural armor was almost impenetrable. Her eyes burned with wrathful hunger, her claws were like iron, and her voice raged like thunder rolling in the clouds.

Whoever looked upon her will become blind or go insane.

Her weakness is the seventh spot on her torso, behind which lies her fiercely burning heart. To kill her, one has to shoot a medicine arrow at this flaw in her natural armor.

==Accounts==
The ancient Lakota tribes of the Northwest had heard rumors from neighboring tribes that a Giant Evil Spirit had emerged from the icy waters of the far Northeast Atlantic. In time the creature and its companion had fought their way across the eastern coast into the midwest, with many different tribes finding ways to scare off the monsters. Until they made their way to the Black Hills (Ȟe Sápa) and sought a new home in the mountains. Once she and her companion arrived and made a place in the mountains. She coexisted with everyone, from the tribes to the Wamakaskan and the other spirit beings. During this time she and her companion began to prepare to spawn offspring. Many different Tribal Clans and Nagi that lived in the Black Hills learned of the monsters&#x27; plans and began making plans to prevent anymore monsters from becoming a threat. Unk Cekula and Unk Tehi coexisted with nature because they were only two that were sustained by nature, but if there were more monsters that needed to kill for survival it meant that more animals and people would die to feed them. This forced everyone to act, before she became the cause of chaos and fear.

Over the many years in which she wreaked havoc in the hills, she was challenged by many warriors from the Lakota tribe. It was learned that the creature had offspring, and the tribes had to kill them when they began feeding on people.

In one myth, Unk Cekula fights with and kills a giant bear, whose fallen body produced the Bear Butte in the Black Hills.

She was slain after she ate the family of a great warrior from the bear clan. This warrior was told by a Weasel spirit that if he was to get swallowed by Unk Cekula, he could use his knife to cut his way out of the belly of the beast and free the other victims.. Alternatively, two twin brothers, one of whom was blind, killed Unk Cekula using arrows given to them by a medicine woman.

Some accounts state that the brothers&#x27; arrows did not kill Unk Cekula, but only injured her so greatly that she damaged the land as she writhed away. As she finally died, the Sun scorched her flesh and dried up the land, resulting in the arid rock formations and skeletons found in the Badlands (Makȟóšiča).

In another myth, Unk Cekula emerged from the primordial waters to flood the land. The resulting devastation angered Wakinyan, who flapped his wings to create a great storm to dry up the land and shoot lightning, killing Unk Cekula. Her heart was destroyed, but her bones were scattered across the land.

==In popular culture==
A fictionalized version of the myth appeared in a &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; story arc starring Wolverine.

She appears in a story told in the 2003 film &quot;Dreamkeeper&quot;, in which Eagle Boy is the one who slays her with weapons given to him by an old woman.

Unk Cekula appears in the urban fantasy novel &quot;Boundary Lines&quot; by Melissa F. Olson.

She appears briefly in the urban fantasy prequel &quot;Death Valley Magic&quot; by Linsey Hall.

J.K Rowling&#x27;s Ilvermoney House, The Horned Serpents, refers to the Unktechi, or the children of Unchegila.

<doc id="93540" wikidata="Q4769661" url="?curid=93540" title="Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group">
<text>The IMF and World Bank meet each autumn in what is officially known as the Annual Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group and each spring in the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group. Names of the two groups are alternated each year so a different one has top billing.

The autumn meetings are customarily held in Washington, D.C., United States for two consecutive years, and in another member country in the third year. At the spring and annual meetings there are meetings of the World Bank-IMF Development Committee and the International Monetary and Financial Committee (IMFC). Each committee is made of up ministers or central bank governors. There are equivalent numbers and the same constituency systems as is used at the Executive boards of the institutions. At the annual meetings, the governors of the World Bank and IMF also meet in plenary sessions.

Until the 2008 financial crisis, both the spring and annual meetings were preceded by meetings of the G7 finance ministers. Amid an unfolding global financial crisis, for the first time the 2008 annual meetings included a meeting of G20 finance ministers. The 2009 annual meetings witnessed the last meetings of the G7 finance ministers, with all future spring and annual meetings accompanied by G20 finance minister meetings. The spring and annual meetings also include meetings of the finance ministers of the G-24 group of developing countries.

Since the mid-1990s, these meetings have centerpoints for anti-globalization movement protests. There have been complete bans on outdoor protests in the 2003 meetings in Dubai, United Arab Emirates as well as the 2006 meeting in Singapore, where only indoor demonstrations within a designated area is permitted. Some argue that such bans are out of safety concerns, while others consider them an effort to curb dissent. These measures have led to retaliatory actions by NGOs who targeted the organisers, as well as the IMF and World Bank for allegedly picking venues which are known to impose such restrictions.

<text>The [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfeet]] are a tribe of Native Americans who currently live in Montana and Alberta. They lived northwest of the Great Lakes and came to participate in Plains Indian culture.

==Cosmology==
In Blackfeet Indian mythology, the supernatural world is dominated by the Sun. The Sun (Nah-too-si; Super powered or Holiness) is equated with the Creator (Apistotoke) by some anthropologists. The Creator is said to have created the earth and everything in the universe. Nah-too-si is sometimes personified by the mystical Napi, or Old Man. Napi was said to have been sent by the Nah-too-si to teach people how to live a sinless life, like he and his wife, Ksah-koom-aukie, Earth Woman. A-pi-su&#x27;-ahts(early riser) was the only surviving child of Sun and Moon, after the rest were attacked and killed by pelicans. Napi is said to have given the Blackfoot visions and, by implication, Blackfoot music.

The numbers four and seven, the cardinal directions, the six principle points and center, are important in Blackfoot mythology. Communication is believed to occur between the supernatural world and Blackfoot through visions of guardian spirits, during which songs and ceremonies may be imparted, such as that of medicine bundles. The physical world is seen as just a glimpse of the spiritual dimension, which is actually the true reality. The Blackfoot people name themselves &quot;Real People&quot; in comparison to anyone that does not possess the ability to communicate with the spirit world like the members of the Blackfoot tribe. 

Ceremonies include the Sun Dance, called Medicine Lodge by the Blackfoot in English, in which sacrifices would be made to Sun. According to the legend the ceremony, the Sun Dance, was started when a human woman, named Feather-woman fell in love with Morning Star, the child of Sun and Moon. After plucking the sacred turnip she and her half-divine son were banished from the Sky-Country, and eventually she died leaving her son, Poïa (Scar-Face), orphaned. Eventually he makes his way back to Sky-Country and because his grandparents, Sun and Moon, took mercy on him he honored them by doing the Sun Dance once a year. These sacrifices ranged from offering sweat, through the use of sweat lodges to actual offerings of flesh, for example men from the tribe would rip off ropes tied to their skin as sacrifices to Sun. The Medicine Lodge would require the Blackfoot to promise vows of eventual sacrifice to Sun throughout the year after requesting protection from war or for family members, or after praying for the health of the tribe.

==Other deities and spirits==
There are three subsections for which minor deities(and/or personifications of nature and animals) are placed into: Above Persons, Ground Persons, and Under Water Persons. Deities such as Thunder, Wind Maker, and Cold Maker were worshipped to influence certain changes in nature like bringing rain and stopping storms.

Amskapipikuni is said to be the inventor of tobacco and made the first war-time killing with an aspen stick.

The Sta-au are believed to be a type of ghost, specifically the ghosts of cruel men and women. Most of the deceased are said to live in certain parts of the hills, but the Sta-au are said to hang around camps. They are believed to cause bad luck and harm to living people, especially in the morning.

==Buffalo Dance==

Historically, one of the primary sources of food many other needs for the Blackfoot was the American Bison, colloquially referred to as the &quot;buffalo&quot;, and as &quot;iiníí&quot;; pl. &quot;iinííksi&quot; in the Blackfoot language. The Buffalo Dance commemorates this reliance.

The typical hunting method was to drive a herd off of a cliff, and butcher them after they died at the bottom.

The night before the hunt, the shaman ceremonially smoked tobacco and prayed to the sun. His wives were not allowed to leave their home, nor even look outside, until he returned; they were to pray to the sun and continually burn sweet grass. Fasting and dressed in a bison headdress, the shaman led a group of people at the head of a V formation. He attracted the herd&#x27;s attention and brought them near the cliff; they were then scared by other men hiding behind them, who waved their robes and shouted. The bison ran off the cliff and died at the rocks below.

According to legend, at one point the bison refused to go over the cliff. A woman walking underneath the cliff saw a herd right on the edge and pledged to marry one which jumped down. One did so and survived, turning into many dead buffalo at the bottom of the cliff. The woman&#x27;s people ate the meat and the young woman left with the buffalo. Her father went in search of her. When he stopped to rest, he told a magpie to search for his daughter and tell her where he was. The magpie found the woman and told her where her father was located. The woman met her father but refused to go home, frightened that the bison would kill her and her father; she said to wait until they were all asleep and would not miss her for some time. When she returned to the bison, her husband smelled another person and, gathering his herd, found the father and trampled him to death. The woman cried and her husband said that if she could bring her father back to life, they could both return to their tribe. The woman asked the magpie to find a piece of her father&#x27;s body; he found a piece of his spine. The woman covered the bone with her robe and sang a song. She was successful and her father was reincarnated. Impressed, the woman&#x27;s husband taught them a dance which would attract the bison and ensure success in the hunt and which would restore the dead bison to life, just as the woman had restored her father to life. The father and daughter returned to their tribe and taught a small group of men, eventually known as I-kun-uh&#x27;-kah-tsi (&quot;all compatriots&quot;), the dances.

<text>A structure is an arrangement and organization of interrelated elements in a material object or system, or the object or system so organized. Material structures include man-made objects such as buildings and machines and natural objects such as biological organisms, minerals and chemicals. Abstract structures include data structures in computer science and musical form. Types of structure include a hierarchy (a cascade of one-to-many relationships), a network featuring many-to-many links, or a lattice featuring connections between components that are neighbors in space.

== Load-bearing ==
Buildings, aircraft, skeletons, anthills, beaver dams, bridges and salt domes are all examples of load-bearing structures. The results of construction are divided into buildings and non-building structures, and make up the infrastructure of a human society. Built structures are broadly divided by their varying design approaches and standards, into categories including building structures, architectural structures, civil engineering structures and mechanical structures.

The effects of loads on physical structures are determined through structural analysis, which is one of the tasks of structural engineering. The structural elements can be classified as one-dimensional (ropes, struts, beams, arches), two-dimensional (membranes, plates, slab, shells, vaults), or three-dimensional (solid masses). Three-dimensional elements were the main option available to early structures such as Chichen Itza. A one-dimensional element has one dimension much larger than the other two, so the other dimensions can be neglected in calculations; however, the ratio of the smaller dimensions and the composition can determine the flexural and compressive stiffness of the element. Two-dimensional elements with a thin third dimension have little of either but can resist biaxial traction.

The structure elements are combined in &quot;structural systems&quot;. The majority of everyday load-bearing structures are &quot;section-active&quot; structures like frames, which are primarily composed of one-dimensional (bending) structures. Other types are &quot;Vector-active&quot; structures such as trusses, &quot;surface-active&quot; structures such as shells and folded plates, &quot;form-active&quot; structures such as cable or membrane structures, and hybrid structures.

Load-bearing biological structures such as bones, teeth, shells, and tendons derive their strength from a multilevel hierarchy of structures employing biominerals and proteins, at the bottom of which are collagen fibrils.

== Biological ==

In biology, one of the properties of life is its highly &quot;ordered&quot; structure, which can be observed at multiple levels such as in cells, tissues, organs, and organisms. 

In another context, structure can also observed in macromolecules, particularly proteins and nucleic acids. The function of these molecules is determined by their shape as well as their composition, and their structure has multiple levels. Protein structure has a four-level hierarchy. The &quot;primary structure&quot; is the sequence of amino acids that make it up. It has a peptide backbone made up of a repeated sequence of a nitrogen and two carbon atoms. The &quot;secondary structure&quot; consists of repeated patterns determined by hydrogen bonding. The two basic types are the α-helix and the β-pleated sheet. The &quot;tertiary structure&quot; is a back and forth bending of the polypeptide chain, and the &quot;quaternary structure&quot; is the way that tertiary units come together and interact. Structural biology is concerned with biomolecular structure of macromolecules.

== Chemical ==
Chemical structure refers to both molecular geometry and electronic structure. The structure can be represented by a variety of diagrams called structural formulas. Lewis structures use a dot notation to represent the valence electrons for an atom; these are the electrons that determine the role of the atom in chemical reactions. Bonds between atoms can be represented by lines with one line for each pair of electrons that is shared. In a simplified version of such a diagram, called a skeletal formula, only carbon-carbon bonds and functional groups are shown.

Atoms in a crystal have a structure that involves repetition of a basic unit called a &quot;unit cell&quot;. The atoms can be modeled as points on a lattice, and one can explore the effect of symmetry operations that include rotations about a point, reflections about a symmetry planes, and &quot;translations&quot; (movements of all the points by the same amount). Each crystal has a finite group, called the space group, of such operations that map it onto itself; there are 230 possible space groups. By Neumann&#x27;s law, the symmetry of a crystal determines what physical properties, including piezoelectricity and ferromagnetism, the crystal can have.

== Mathematical ==
== Musical ==
A large part of numerical analysis involves identifying and interpreting the structure of musical works. Structure can be found at the level of part of a work, the entire work, or a group of works. Elements of music such as pitch, duration and timbre combine into small elements like motifs and phrases, and these in turn combine in larger structures. Not all music (for example, that of John Cage) has a hierarchical organization, but hierarchy makes it easier for a listener to understand and remember the music.

In analogy to linguistic terminology, motifs and phrases can be combined to make complete musical ideas such as sentences and phrases. A larger form is known as the period. One such form that was widely used between 1600 and 1900 has two phrases, an &quot;antecedent&quot; and a &quot;consequent&quot;, with a half cadence in the middle and a full cadence at the end providing punctuation. On a larger scale are single-movement forms such as the sonata form and the contrapuntal form, and multi-movement forms such as the symphony.

== Social ==
A social structure is a pattern of relationships. They are social organizations of individuals in various life situations. Structures are applicable to people in how a society is as a system organized by a characteristic pattern of relationships. This is known as the social organization of the group. Sociologists have studied the changing structure of these groups. Structure and agency are two confronted theories about human behaviour. The debate surrounding the influence of structure and agency on human thought is one of the central issues in sociology. In this context, &quot;agency&quot; refers to the individual human capacity to act independently and make free choices. &quot;Structure&quot; here refers to factors such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, customs, etc. that seem to limit or influence individual opportunities.

== Data ==
In computer science, a data structure is a way of organizing information in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures are built out of two basic types: An array has an index that can be used for immediate access to any data item (some programming languages require array size to be initialized). A linked list can be reorganized, grown or shrunk, but its elements must be accessed with a pointer that links them together in a particular order. Out of these any number of other data structures can be created such as stacks, queues, trees and hash tables.

In solving a problem, a data structure is generally an integral part of the algorithm. In modern programming style, algorithms and data structures are encapsulated together in an abstract data type.

== Software ==
Software architecture is the specific choices made between possible alternatives within a framework. For example, a framework might require a database and the architecture would specify the type and manufacturer of the database. The structure of software is the way in which it is partitioned into interrelated components. A key structural issue is minimizing dependencies between these components. This makes it possible to change one component without requiring changes in others. The purpose of structure is to optimise for (brevity, readability, traceability, isolation and encapsulation, maintainability, extensibility, performance and efficiency), examples being: language choice, code, functions, libraries, builds, system evolution, or diagrams for flow logic and design. Structural elements reflect the requirements of the application: for example, if the system requires a high fault tolerance, then a redundant structure is needed so that if a component fails it has backups. A high redundancy is an essential part of the design of several systems in the Space Shuttle.

== Logical ==
As a branch of philosophy, logic is concerned with distinguishing good arguments from poor ones. A chief concern is with the structure of arguments. An argument consists of one or more premises from which a conclusion is inferred. The steps in this inference can be expressed in a formal way and their structure analyzed. Two basic types of inference are deduction and induction. In a valid deduction, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, regardless of whether they are true or not. An invalid deduction contains some error in the analysis. An inductive argument claims that if the premises are true, the conclusion is likely.

<text>Arthur John Robin Gorell Milner (13 January 1934 – 20 March 2010) was a British computer scientist, and a Turing Award winner.

==Life, education and career==

Milner was born in Yealmpton, near Plymouth, England into a military family. He gained a King&#x27;s Scholarship to Eton College in 1947, and was awarded the Tomline Prize (the highest prize in Mathematics at Eton) in 1952. Subsequently, he served in the Royal Engineers, attaining the rank of Second Lieutenant. He then enrolled at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1957. Milner first worked as a schoolteacher then as a programmer at Ferranti, before entering academia at City University, London, then Swansea University, Stanford University, and from 1973 at the University of Edinburgh, where he was a co-founder of the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS). He returned to Cambridge as the head of the Computer Laboratory in 1995 from which he eventually stepped down, although he was still at the laboratory. From 2009, Milner was a Scottish Informatics &amp; Computer Science Alliance Advanced Research Fellow and held (part-time) the Chair of Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.

Milner died of a heart attack on 20 March 2010 in Cambridge. His wife, Lucy, died shortly before he did.

==Contributions==

Milner is generally regarded as having made three major contributions to computer science. He developed Logic for Computable Functions (LCF), one of the first tools for automated theorem proving. The language he developed for LCF, ML, was the first language with polymorphic type inference and type-safe exception handling. In a very different area, Milner also developed a theoretical framework for analyzing concurrent systems, the calculus of communicating systems (CCS), and its successor, the -calculus.

At the time of his death, he was working on bigraphs, a formalism for ubiquitous computing subsuming CCS and the -calculus. He is also credited for rediscovering the Hindley–Milner type system.

==Honours and awards==

He was made a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society in 1988. Milner received the ACM Turing Award in 1991. In 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. In 2004, the Royal Society of Edinburgh awarded Milner with a Royal Medal for his &quot;bringing about public benefits on a global scale&quot;. In 2008, he was elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Engineering for &quot;fundamental contributions to computer science, including the development of LCF, ML, CCS, and the -calculus.&quot;

The Royal Society Milner Award
and the ACM SIGPLAN Robin Milner Young Researcher Award are both named after him.

<text>Edgar Frank &quot;Ted&quot; Codd (19 August 1923 – 18 April 2003) was a British computer scientist who, while working for IBM, invented the relational model for database management, the theoretical basis for relational databases and relational database management systems. He made other valuable contributions to computer science, but the relational model, a very influential general theory of data management, remains his most mentioned, analyzed and celebrated achievement.

== Biography ==
Edgar Frank Codd was born in Fortuneswell, on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. After attending Poole Grammar School, he studied mathematics and chemistry at Exeter College, Oxford, before serving as a pilot in the RAF Coastal Command during the Second World War, flying Sunderlands. In 1948, he moved to New York to work for IBM as a mathematical programmer. Codd first worked for the company&#x27;s Selective Sequence Electronic (SSEC) project and was later involved in the development of IBM 701 and 702.

In 1953, dismayed by Senator Joseph McCarthy, Codd moved to Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In 1957, he returned to the US working for IBM and from 1961 to 1965 pursuing his doctorate in computer science at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Two years later, he moved to San Jose, California, to work at IBM&#x27;s San Jose Research Laboratory, where he continued to work until the 1980s. He was appointed IBM Fellow in 1976. During the 1990s, his health deteriorated and he ceased work.

Codd received the Turing Award in 1981, and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.

Codd died of heart failure at his home in Williams Island, Florida, at the age of 79 on 18 April 2003.

== Work ==
Codd received a PhD in 1965 from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by John Henry Holland. His thesis was about self-replication in cellular automata, extending on work of von Neumann and showing that a set of eight states was sufficient for universal computation and construction. His design for a self-replicating computer was implemented only in 2010.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked out his theories of data arrangement, issuing his paper &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&quot; in 1970, after an internal IBM paper one year earlier. To his disappointment, IBM proved slow to exploit his suggestions until commercial rivals started implementing them.

Initially, IBM refused to implement the relational model to preserve revenue from IMS/DB, a hierarchical database the company promoted in the 1970s. Codd then showed IBM customers the potential of the implementation of its model, and they, in turn, pressured IBM. Then IBM included in its Future Systems project a System R subproject – but put in charge of it developers who were not thoroughly familiar with Codd&#x27;s ideas, and isolated the team from Codd. As a result, they did not use Codd&#x27;s own Alpha language but created a non-relational one, SEQUEL. Even so, SEQUEL was so superior to pre-relational systems that in 1979 it was copied by Larry Ellison, based on pre-launch papers presented at conferences of Relational Software Inc, in his Oracle Database, which actually reached the market before SQL/DS – because of the then-already proprietary status of the original name, SEQUEL had to be renamed to SQL.

Codd continued to develop and extend his relational model, sometimes in collaboration with Christopher J. Date. One of the normalised forms, the Boyce–Codd normal form, is named after him.

Codd&#x27;s theorem, a result proven in his seminal work on the relational model, equates the expressive power of relational algebra and relational calculus.

As the relational model became fashionable in the early 1980s, Codd fought a sometimes bitter campaign to prevent the term from being misused by database vendors who had merely added a relational veneer to older technology. As part of this campaign, he published his 12 rules to define what constituted a relational database. This made his position at IBM increasingly difficult, so he left to form a consulting company with Chris Date and others.

Codd coined the term &quot;Online analytical processing (OLAP)&quot; and wrote the &quot;twelve laws of online analytical processing&quot;. Controversy erupted, however, after it was discovered that this paper had been sponsored by Arbor Software (subsequently Hyperion, now acquired by Oracle), a conflict of interest that had not been disclosed, and &quot;Computerworld&quot; withdrew the paper.

In 2004, SIGMOD renamed its highest prize to the SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award, in his honour.

<text>Dennis Dale McLain (born March 29, 1944) is an American former professional baseball player. He played for ten seasons in Major League Baseball as a right-handed pitcher, most prominently as a member of the Detroit Tigers. In 1968, McLain became the last Major League Baseball pitcher to win 30 or more games during a season (with a record of 31–6) — a feat accomplished by only 11 players in the 20th century, with the most recent 34 years earlier.

As a player, McLain was known for his outspoken nature, which occasionally led to conflicts with teammates and fans. His early major league career included notable achievements such as two Cy Young awards and an American League MVP award. While achieving success in baseball, McLain faced legal issues in his personal life, including convictions related to organized crime and embezzlement, for which he served time in prison.

==Professional playing career==

===The rise to stardom===
McLain was born in Markham, Illinois, and attended Mt. Carmel High School in Chicago, where he played on the baseball team as a shortstop and pitcher. As a teenager, he met his future wife, Sharyn Boudreau, the daughter of major league player Lou Boudreau. McLain was also musically talented, learning to play the organ from Bob Creed, the Chicago White Sox organist.

Upon his graduation from high school in June 1962, McLain was signed by the Chicago White Sox as an amateur free agent, and was assigned to play with the Harlan Smokies of the Appalachian League. McLain&#x27;s minor league debut was notable for throwing a no-hitter and striking out 16 batters in a game against the Salem Rebels on June 28. After just two games with the Smokies, he was promoted to the Clinton C-Sox of the Midwest League, where he posted a record of four wins and seven losses.

At the time, players with one year of service in the minor leagues were subject to a draft if they were not called up to the major leagues. The White Sox left McLain in the minor leagues, and he was selected off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on April 8, 1963. He progressed swiftly through the Tigers&#x27; minor league system, jumping from Class A Duluth-Superior to Class AA Knoxville during the summer. The Tigers saw enough promise that they decided to advance him all the way from Class AA to the majors, and he made his major league debut on September 21, 1963 at the age of 19. His debut against the Chicago White Sox was notable, as he allowed one earned run on seven hits. He also picked off two baserunners and hit a home run, which was the only home run of his major-league career. McLain is one of only six teenage pitchers to hit a major-league home run since 1920, a list that includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and Jim Palmer.

McLain began the 1964 season with the Syracuse Chiefs of the International League, but was called back to the major leagues in early June and ended the season with a won-loss record of 4–5. He then played for the Mayagüez Indians in the Puerto Rico Baseball League, where he posted a 13–2 record and helped the Indians win the league championship. He was called back to the majors in 1965 and continued to pitch well for the Tigers. On June 15, McLain set a major-league record for relief pitchers, when he struck out the first seven batters he faced after entering the game in the first inning to relieve starting pitcher Dave Wickersham. He ended the season with a 16–6 record, a 2.61 earned run average, and 192 strikeouts, the third-highest strikeout total in the American League behind Sam McDowell and teammate Mickey Lolich. Although he had a curveball and a changeup, he relied mostly on his fastball to get batters out.

In 1966, McLain had a 13–4 mid-season record and earned the role of American League starting pitcher in the 1966 All-Star Game, where he threw just 28 pitches to retire all nine batters that he faced. He finished the season with a 20–14 record with a 3.92 earned run average.

In 1967, the Tigers hired former major-league pitcher Johnny Sain as their pitching coach. Sain helped develop McLain&#x27;s pitching skills and taught him the psychology of pitching. The 1967 season was memorable due to the tight four-way pennant race between the Tigers, the Boston Red Sox, the Minnesota Twins, and the Chicago White Sox. McLain finished with a 17–16 record and a 3.79 earned run average but was winless after August 29. On September 18, McLain reported that he had severely injured two toes on his left foot, saying that he had stubbed them after his foot had fallen asleep. Going into the final game of the season against the California Angels, the Tigers needed a victory to force a one-game playoff with the Red Sox for the American League pennant. McLain pitched ineffectively in the final game and the Tigers lost to finish the season one game behind the Red Sox.

===The year of the pitcher===
Ten games into the 1968 season, the Tigers were in first place, having won nine consecutive games after losing the opener. McLain made controversial statements in early May by criticizing Detroit fans for being &quot;the biggest front-running fans in the world.&quot; He continued to win games at a remarkable pace, registering his 29th victory on September 10. On September 13, he appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot;. On September 14 at Tiger Stadium, McLain pitched the Tigers to a 5–4 victory over the Oakland Athletics in front of a nationally televised audience to become Major League Baseball&#x27;s first 30-game winner since 1934. Dizzy Dean, the previous 30-game winner, was on hand to congratulate him.

After the Tigers had clinched the 1968 American League pennant, McLain attracted attention during his 31st and final regular season victory in a game against the Yankees on September 19. McLain had grown up idolizing New York Yankee center fielder Mickey Mantle, who entered the game tied with Jimmie Foxx for third place in the major-league career home runs list. When Mantle—who was nine days away from his last major league appearance—came to bat in the eighth inning with the Tigers leading 6–1, McLain intentionally threw a soft pitch directly over home plate. Other accounts said that he called catcher Jim Price to the mound and had him tell Mantle that he would be throwing only fastballs. Mantle hit the pitch for his 535th career home run (the penultimate home run Mantle would hit in his career), putting him in sole possession of third place on the all-time home run list, behind only Babe Ruth and Willie Mays. After Mantle&#x27;s home run, McLain remained on the pitcher&#x27;s mound and acknowledged the moment, while Mantle acknowledged McLain as he rounded the bases. The next batter, Joe Pepitone, waved his bat over the plate, as if asking for an easy pitch of his own. McLain responded by throwing the next pitch over Pepitone&#x27;s head. After the game, McLain smilingly denied that he had served up an easy pitch for Mantle to hit; however, he was later reprimanded by Major League Baseball Commissioner William Eckert.

McLain completed a 31–6 record along with a 1.96 earned run average, as the Tigers won the American League pennant by 12 games. He had 280 strikeouts and 63 walks, giving him a 4.44 K:BB ratio, a Tigers season record that stood until 2016, when it was eclipsed by Justin Verlander. McLain also earned his second All-Star berth and won the 1968 American League Cy Young Award, as well as the American League Most Valuable Player Award, the first by an American League pitcher since Bobby Shantz in 1952 and the first by a Tiger since fellow pitcher Hal Newhouser&#x27;s back-to-back honors in 1944 and 1945. He was the first pitcher in American League history to win the Most Valuable Player Award and the Cy Young Award in the same season. St. Louis Cardinal Bob Gibson won the National League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award that same year, making 1968 the only season to date in which a pitcher won the MVP Award in both leagues (it was also the only time both Cy Young Award winners were voted unanimously until 2022).

McLain&#x27;s performance in the Tigers&#x27; 1968 World Series triumph over the Cardinals was not as impressive as his regular season. Having already pitched 336 innings and 28 complete games during the regular season, a sore-armed McLain lost twice to Gibson (including a still-standing World Series record 17-strikeout performance in the opener) to help put the Tigers down three games to one. Trailing three games to two, McLain won the crucial Game 6 on just two days&#x27; rest, aided by a grand slam home run from Jim Northrup. Teammate Mickey Lolich won three games during the series, including a complete-game triumph (also on two days’ rest) in Game 7 against Gibson, and won the World Series MVP award. After the season, when McLain was asked about Lolich&#x27;s performance in the World Series, he responded controversially by saying: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trade one Bob Gibson for 12 Mickey Loliches.&quot;

The season became known as the &quot;Year of the Pitcher&quot;, with batting averages and run production dropping in both leagues. After the record home-run year by Roger Maris in 1961, the major leagues increased the size of the strike zone from the top of the batter&#x27;s shoulders to the bottom of the knees. Pitchers such as McLain and Gibson among others dominated hitters, producing 339 shutouts in 1968. Carl Yastrzemski was the only American League hitter to finish the season with a batting average higher than .300. In the National League, Gibson posted a 1.12 earned run average, the lowest in 54 years, while Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale threw a record consecutive scoreless innings during the 1968 season. As a result of the dropping offensive statistics, Major League Baseball took steps to reduce the advantage held by pitchers by lowering the height of the pitcher&#x27;s mound from 15 inches to 10, and by reducing the size of the strike zone for the 1969 season. Since then, no pitcher has won more than 27 games in a season.

===Later career===
In January 1969, McLain was selected as the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year. He created more disruption when he was named as the starting pitcher for the American League in the 1969 All-Star Game in Washington, D.C., but missed the start of the game because of a dental appointment in Detroit. The appointment was scheduled for Wednesday the 23rd, the day after the All-Star game, but because of a rainout on the scheduled date, the game was played on the 23rd.

McLain often deviated from conventional expectations, demonstrating an independent approach. He had learned to fly and purchased an airplane. Having kept his dental appointment, he then flew himself to Washington, arriving at the game during the second inning. He pitched in the fourth inning, but by then the National League had already built a 9–2 lead.

McLain had disagreements with Tigers&#x27; manager Mayo Smith, including disputes over the firing of pitching coach Johnny Sain. Despite the troubles, McLain had another productive season in 1969, winning 24 games and a second consecutive Cy Young Award, tying with Baltimore&#x27;s Mike Cuellar, marking the first time two players had shared the award. It was the last award of his major league career.

===The downfall===
In February 1970, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; both published articles about McLain&#x27;s involvement in bookmaking activities. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cited sources who alleged that the foot injury suffered by McLain late in 1967 was caused by an organized crime figure who stomped on McLain&#x27;s foot as punishment for failing to pay off on a lost bet. Early in his career, McLain&#x27;s interest in betting on horses was piqued by Chuck Dressen, one of his first managers. McLain&#x27;s involvement in gambling reportedly began following a discussion about shared interests with a Pepsi representative. (When he pitched, he was known to drink a Pepsi between innings.) A representative from Pepsi then offered McLain a contract with the company, just for doing a few endorsements. McLain soon realized that he and the Pepsi representative shared an affinity for gambling; when the two realized how much money they were losing, and that they could earn so much more by &quot;taking the action&quot; on bets, they attempted to set up a bookmaking operation as hands-off, silent partners.

McLain was suspended indefinitely by Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn; the suspension was then set for the first three months of the 1970 season. He returned in mid-season, but struggled to pitch well. In September, the Tigers suspended him for seven days after he doused sportswriters Jim Hawkins of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; and Watson Spoelstra of &quot;The Detroit News&quot; with buckets of water. Just as the seven-day suspension was about to end, he was suspended for at least the remainder of the season by Kuhn for carrying a gun on a team flight. McLain&#x27;s 1970 season ended with a won-loss record of only 3–5. Later that year, he was forced into bankruptcy despite being the first $100,000 player in Tigers history. Meanwhile, McLain and his teammate Jim Northrup schemed together to make more money; they were back in Detroit furthering a plan that they shared to generate a nude baseball model calendar. These efforts eventually fell short.

On October 9, 1970, the Tigers traded McLain, Elliott Maddox, Norm McRae, and Don Wert to the Washington Senators for Joe Coleman, Eddie Brinkman, Jim Hannan, and Aurelio Rodríguez. Kuhn actually had to clear the trade because McLain was still under suspension, and suspended players cannot be traded without the commissioner&#x27;s permission. Kuhn later wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Hardball: The Education of a Baseball Commissioner&quot;, that he was shocked at what he called a &quot;foolish gamble&quot; by the Senators, and predicted that the trade would turn out to be a Tiger heist.

The McLain trade occurred despite objections from Senators manager Ted Williams, who reportedly disagreed with the decision. The feeling was mutual; early in the 1971 season, McLain became a charter member of the &quot;Underminers&#x27; Club&quot;, a group of five players dedicated to getting Williams fired. They spent much of the season feuding over Williams&#x27; use of a then-unusual five-man rotation for his starters. Senators broadcaster Shelby Whitfield later told Rob Neyer that when Williams yanked McLain early from a July 5 game against the Cleveland Indians, McLain threatened to call Senators owner Bob Short and have him get rid of Williams.

By this time, McLain had serious arm trouble, inadvertently made worse by numerous cortisone shots he took for his sore arm. As a result, he essentially stopped throwing fastballs midway through the 1971 season. Due to his arm troubles and his inability to get along with Williams, McLain went 10–22. He thus earned the dubious distinction of going from leading his league in wins (tied with Mike Cuellar with 24 wins in 1969) to two years later leading his league in losses. McLain&#x27;s 22 defeats (a mark later tied by three pitchers, all in 1974) remains the most in a major-league season since Jack Fisher of the Mets lost 24 in 1965.

After the 1971 season, McLain was traded to the Oakland Athletics for journeyman pitcher Jim Panther and prospect Don Stanhouse (who went on to have a few good years as the Baltimore Orioles&#x27; closer in the late 1970s). After only five starts, one win, and a 6.04 ERA, the Athletics sent him to the minor leagues on May 15. The Associated Press said the reasons for the demotion were &quot;pitches which lacked steam and a medical problem.&quot; On June 29, Oakland traded him to the Atlanta Braves for Orlando Cepeda; he went only 3–5 for Atlanta, and his overall totals for 1972 were 4–7 with a 6.37 ERA. His final major league appearance came on September 12 against the Cincinnati Reds; he came into a tied game in the ninth and promptly gave up three runs without retiring a batter, taking the loss. (Coincidentally, the last batter McLain ever faced in the major leagues was Pete Rose, who also was involved in a gambling scandal years later.) The Braves released McLain during spring training, on March 26, 1973. After short stints with minor-league clubs in Des Moines and Shreveport, McLain retired. Three years after winning 31 games and two years after winning his second consecutive Cy Young, he was out of baseball at the age of 29.

==Music career==
McLain&#x27;s success on the playing field led to endorsement opportunities from the Hammond Organ Company; he also made musical appearances in Las Vegas. He was invited to appear with his musical quartet on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; along with his World Series opponent (and guitarist) Bob Gibson. McLain also made appearances on &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot; and &quot;The Joey Bishop Show&quot;. He also released two albums on Capitol Records, &quot;Denny McLain at the Organ&quot; (1968) and &quot;Denny McLain in Las Vegas&quot; (1969).

==Career statistics==
In a 10-year major-league career, McLain won 131 games against 91 losses. His career earned run average was 3.39 and he recorded 1,282 strikeouts in 1,886 innings pitched. McLain was a three-time All-Star and won the Cy Young Award twice in his career. Because he relied so much on his fastball, he also surrendered numerous home runs, leading the American League in home runs allowed in three consecutive years (1966–1968).

Since McLain&#x27;s 31-win season, only two other pitchers have approached the 30-game milestone (Steve Carlton won 27 games in 1972 and Bob Welch also with 27 victories in 1990). With Major League Baseball moving from the four-man pitching rotation of McLain&#x27;s era to five-man rotations, and with the increased reliance on relief pitchers, some observers believe that another 30-game winner may not occur because of the way the game is played today.

==Post-major league career==

In 1974, McLain played a season for the London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League at Labatt Memorial Park in London, Ontario. Because of his arm problems, McLain pitched only nine innings for the Majors, but played in 14 games at shortstop, first base, or catcher, and batted .380, including hitting two homers in one game in London.

McLain continued to earn side money playing the organ at clubs, including a club in suburban Detroit where former heavyweight boxing champion Leon Spinks worked as a bartender. McLain also earned quite a bit of money hustling golf, easily attracting &quot;marks&quot; due to his past baseball fame. Additionally, he reportedly once accepted over $160,000 to fly a wanted felon out of the country.

McLain&#x27;s weight ballooned to during his post-baseball career. He was imprisoned for drug trafficking (cocaine), embezzlement, and racketeering. Tampa attorneys Arnold Levine and Stevan Northcutt, who later became a Florida state appellate judge, represented McLain before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta. His conviction was reversed under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa.

Between his stints in prison and rehabilitation in the mid-1980s to the early-1990s, McLain could be found on various talk radio sports shows and occasionally on panel-format sports shows on network television in the Detroit area; he also modeled Hanes underwear. He could also be found signing autographs at a metro Detroit 7-Eleven store at the corner of Mound Road and Metro Parkway in Sterling Heights, Michigan, where he was employed on work-release. After his release, he also hosted a popular daily talk radio show for a few years on Detroit talk station WXYT.

McLain&#x27;s oldest daughter, Kristin, 26, was killed on March 20, 1992, in a drunk-driving crash. She had been living in Florida and was moving back home to Michigan when she was killed just a few miles from her parents&#x27; home. In part to escape his grief, McLain and several partners bought the Peet Packing Company (Farmer Peet&#x27;s) located in the small town of Chesaning, Michigan, in 1994. McLain was also a partner in the Michigan Radio Network. Both companies went bankrupt two years later. In 1996, he was convicted on charges of embezzlement, mail fraud, and conspiracy in connection with the theft of $2.5 million from the Peet employees&#x27; pension fund. McLain spent six years in prison; in 2008, he insisted that he knew nothing about the shady financial deals alleged by the government. McLain claims he paid restitution for this incident.

During the Detroit Tigers 2006 playoff run, McLain was the baseball analyst for Drew and Mike on WRIF radio in Detroit. In 2007, McLain released his autobiography &quot;I Told You I Wasn&#x27;t Perfect&quot;, co-authored by longtime Detroit sportscaster and author Eli Zaret. Prior to that, McLain and Zaret hosted a sports television show together in Detroit.

McLain currently resides in Pinckney, Michigan. McLain writes a monthly editorial column and blogs regularly for &quot;In Play! Magazine&quot;, a Detroit sports magazine.

Kevin Costner&#x27;s character in the 2005 film &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot; was partly based on McLain (and also partly on Kirk Gibson, another Tiger of World Series note).

On April 11, 2008, McLain was arrested without incident after deputies discovered an outstanding warrant against him for failing to appear for a January 16 court hearing.

On September 22, 2011, McLain was arrested in Port Huron, Michigan at the Canada–United States border after officials discovered an outstanding warrant against him from St. Charles Parish, Louisiana. Because of construction detours, McLain had inadvertently taken an exit off I-94, sending him directly across the Blue Water Bridge and into Canada. He immediately returned to the U.S., where he was obligated to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection inspection. The outstanding warrant was then discovered, for which McLain was jailed in Port Huron. In less than a week, the warrant was cleared and McLain was released.

From 2017 to 2018, McLain hosted a Sunday radio show about life and politics on WFDF (AM).

In January 2019 McLain and former local sportscasters Eli Zaret and Bob Page launched a podcast called &quot;No Filter Sports&quot;.

In October 2020, McLain held an estate sale hosted by Aaron&#x27;s Estate Sales. This event was covered nationally by outlets such as ESPN and the Associated Press.

<text>Huntington is a city in Cabell and Wayne counties in the U.S. state of West Virginia. The seat of Cabell County, the city is located at the confluence of the Ohio and Guyandotte rivers in the state&#x27;s southwestern region. The population was 46,842 at the 2020 census, and was estimated to be 45,325 in 2023. Huntington is the second-most populous city in West Virginia. The Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area, spanning seven counties across West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio, had an estimated population of 368,262 in 2023.

Surrounded by extensive natural resources, the area was first settled in 1775 as Holderby&#x27;s Landing. Its location was selected as ideal for the western terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, which founded Huntington as one of the nation&#x27;s first planned communities to facilitate transportation industries. The city quickly developed after the railroad&#x27;s completion in 1871 and is eponymously named for the railroad company&#x27;s founder, Collis Potter Huntington. The city became a hub for manufacturing, transportation, and industrialization, with an industrial sector based in coal, oil, chemicals and steel. After World War II, due to the shutdown of these industries, the city lost nearly 46% of its population, from a peak of 86,353 in 1950 to 54,844 in 1990.

Huntington is a vital rail-to-river transfer point for the marine transportation industry. It is home to the Port of Huntington Tri-State, the second-busiest inland port in the United States. Also, it is considered a scenic locale in the western foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The city is the home of Marshall University as well as the Huntington Museum of Art, Mountain Health Arena, Camden Park, one of the world&#x27;s oldest amusement parks; and the headquarters of the CSX Transportation-Huntington Division.

==History==
Discounting the period of French ownership, the land that was part of Guyandotte and later Huntington was originally part of the French and Indian War veteran&#x27;s Savage Grant. The area of greater Huntington, although situated in a Southern state, was long considered a western city in what was then the Colony of Virginia since the first permanent settlements were founded in 1775 in defiance of British injunctions against settlements west of the Alleghenies in the vicinity of Holderby&#x27;s Landing.

===19th century===
Historically, the old Federal Era town of Guyandotte was first built upon in 1799 by French settlers of the Ohio Valley. A farmer James Holderby (1782–1855) purchased the lands in 1821 upon which much of Huntington now stands which is why the area was known as Holderby&#x27;s Landing prior to 1870 when it was incorporated and renamed; Holderby&#x27;s estate included the lands gifted in 1837 to found what is now Marshall University. The town of Guyandotte was officially absorbed in 1891.

The modern City of Huntington was founded by Collis P. Huntington and Delos W. Emmons as the western terminus for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) on a tract of land west of the mouth of the Guyandotte River, between the Ohio River and Twelve Pole Creek. Collis P. Huntington was one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of western railroading who built the Central Pacific Railroad as part of the first U.S. transcontinental railroad (along with Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker).

Huntington was created as a hub for the C&amp;O, which, once completed in 1873, fulfilled a long-held dream of the Virginias to have a rail link from the James River at Richmond, Virginia to the Ohio River Valley. The new railroad facilities adjacent to the Ohio River resulted in expansion of the former small town of Guyandotte into part of a large new city called Huntington. The C&amp;O Railroad expanded east to Newport News (and coal piers), and west to eventually reach Cincinnati and Chicago in later years. After merging with several other railroads, C&amp;O is now known as CSX Transportation.

The city was incorporated in 1871 just west of the earlier city of Guyandotte. Guyandotte, which became a neighborhood of Huntington in 1891, was founded in 1799 on land that was originally part of the French and Indian War veteran&#x27;s Savage Grant. Meriwether Lewis passed the Guyandotte and Big Sandy River peninsula on or about September 20, 1803, on his way down the Ohio River before meeting up with William Clark in Clarksville, Ind.

An election was held on December 31, 1871, where Peter Cline Buffington was elected the first mayor of Huntington. A police force was created almost immediately after the election of a marshal, however before the city was six months old the marshal was authorized to appoint a special police force to handle a large crowd that was attending a circus in the city. In the fall of 1872, the city faced a smallpox outbreak.

The Huntington Bank was robbed on September 6, 1875, by a band of horseman who escaped out of Wayne County. The city pursued the robbers and captured Thomas J. Webb. He was convicted of the robbery on December 4, 1875, and sentenced to 14 years in prison, where he died. Local legend has held that these robbers were members of the Jesse James Gang, but both Frank and Jesse James were nowhere near Huntington at this point in time, so the story of their involvement is not factual.

===20th century===

Huntington was the second American city to feature electric streetcars in the early years (after San Francisco), until they were gradually replaced with gasoline-powered buses. Some of the old trolley tracks can still be seen. Camden Park, which at 110 years old is one of the world&#x27;s oldest amusement parks, was built in 1903 to encourage ridership on the trolleys (then owned by the Camden Interstate Railway Company).

Huntington&#x27;s &quot;boom&quot; period occurred from the founding in 1871 until the Great Flood of 1937, which claimed 5 lives, caused millions of dollars in damage, left tens of thousands homeless, and led to the creation of Huntington&#x27;s flood walls in 1938. Of the 40,000 people living in the flooded areas of Huntington, 25,000 were made refugees as fresh water and fuel was scarce. 11,000 people applied for Red Cross aid during the flood and the relief period.

As Manager of Operations in 1921, John Fairfield Thompson supervised the construction and initial operations of the International Nickel Company&#x27;s plant and rolling mill. They were founded by Inco&#x27;s President Robert C. Stanley for the production of high-nickel alloys. As of 2025, this plant continued part of the Special Metals Corporation.
World War II brought another economic boom, but that was short-lived and ended along with the war in the 1940s. Huntington&#x27;s population began to drop after 1950 because of urban sprawl and the decline of the steel and manufacturing industries. In the 1970s, federal urban renewal programs destroyed several parts of downtown. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s the steel and manufacturing industry in the region imploded, with massive layoffs and mill and plant closures.

A shift to the city&#x27;s economic base began in the late 1980s to focus more on education, tourism, and services, based mainly on healthcare/medicine and biotechnology. Although Huntington successfully shifted the focus of its economy, the population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 86,353 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence caused a sharp decrease in population to just 51,475 in 2000.

===21st century===
Huntington has seen a major revival since the opening of the Pullman Square Town Center on the vacant lot formerly known as the &quot;Superblock&quot; in 2005, the filming of the Warner Bros. motion picture &quot;We Are Marshall&quot; in 2006, and the filming of ABC&#x27;s Food Revolution in 2010. The modern Huntington Metro Area spans 7 counties across 3 states and is the largest in West Virginia with a population of more than 360,000. The largest employers are Marshall University, Cabell Huntington Hospital, St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center, Amazon, DirecTV, and the City of Huntington.

Shortly after Pullman Square was constructed, the city began work on upgrading the streetscape on Fourth Avenue and Ninth Street. Ninth Street was formerly known as the Ninth Street Plaza and was closed to vehicle traffic for many years. Once anchored by Pullman Square on the north end, the old plaza was removed in 2006 and Ninth Street has once again become attractive to businesses. Fourth Avenue, known as the &quot;Old Main Corridor&quot;, has been upgraded with new lighting, artistic and pedestrian-friendly design concepts, and bicycle lanes.

Efforts to redevelop Huntington started with the construction of the $10.5 million Huntington Civic Arena, which was the largest arena in the state when it opened in 1977. The 25-year delay in construction of what became Pullman Square caused the building to become a money losing effort for the city and is now managed privately by SMG. After renovation in 1997, and 2010, the arena has now been included in &quot;Billboard&quot; &quot;New or Renovated Venues to Watch&quot; list for 2013. Huntington&#x27;s arena landed at No. 14 in a list of 17 venues across the globe. The exterior was also renovated in 2020–2021.

The Huntington Mall, the largest mall in the state, opened a few years after the Arena in 1981. When the mall was built, the only other businesses around it were two bars and a gas station. Since the mall&#x27;s opening, several retailers have built around the mall, including four hotels and several restaurants, as well as a Walmart Supercenter, the first Best Buy in West Virginia, and the first Sheetz gas station/convenience store in southern West Virginia. The Huntington Mall has a yearly economic impact of close to $400 million.
The Shops at Heritage Station are in the old Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Depot, originally constructed in 1887. The complex includes an original steam engine with a &quot;Pullman&quot; train car, and a building that used to house one of Huntington&#x27;s first banks—which was the easternmost bank robbed by the James-Younger Gang. That structure is currently occupied by a specialty beer and cheese shop. Heritage Station was turned into a shopping center called &quot;Heritage Village&quot; during the dark days of Urban Renewal in the 1970s. For decades, the station sat hidden and virtually unused just two blocks from the city center, until Create Huntington got involved in 2006. Today, Heritage Station is an artisan retail complex, with locally owned shops, and home to public events like the annual Diamond Teeth Mary Blues Festival, named for the blues singer born in the town.

In 2017, Huntington joined a host of other municipalities and local governments in the area suing eight pharmaceutical companies, claiming their products harmed Huntington&#x27;s welfare, leading to a drug crisis in the city and surrounding county. Included in the lawsuits are companies like McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp, among others.

==Geography==

Huntington is located in western Cabell County at (38.4192496, -82.4451540). The elevation is above sea level.

Huntington is in the southwestern corner of West Virginia, on the border with Ohio, on the southern bank of the Ohio River, at the confluence with the Guyandotte River. The city lies within the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau. Most of the city is in Cabell County, for which it is the county seat.

Modern day Huntington is commonly divided into four main sections. The north–south divider is the CSX railroad tracks, while the east/west divider is First Street. A portion of the city, mainly the neighborhood of Westmoreland, is in Wayne County. Most of the city is in Cabell County, of which it is the county seat. Huntington is influenced by Appalachian Culture, Southern culture, Midwestern culture, and Mid-Atlantic culture. It is often referred to as one of the northernmost cities in the South or one of the southernmost cities in the North.

The Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area is sometimes called KYOWVA, an acronym that refers to the three states that make up the region, (Kentucky, Ohio, and West Virginia). As of the 2020 census, the Huntington Metro Area is the largest in West Virginia with a population of 376,155. Huntington is combined with Charleston, the state capital, as the Huntington-Charleston TV market, the 81st-largest in the nation.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. The Guyandotte River joins the Ohio River about east of downtown. Huntington fills the roughly three-mile wide flood plain of the south bank of the Ohio River for eighty square blocks and portions of the hills to the immediate south and southeast.

===Climate===
Because of its position in the westernmost and lowest area of the state, the city is on the northern limits of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), unlike the &quot;highlands&quot; of West Virginia, which are in the Allegheny Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains. This location gives the city an even four seasons, with each season beginning around the calendar date. Huntington is made humid by the Ohio River, but summers are not as hot as they are further south and west. Snowfall generally falls in moderate amounts, accumulating an average seasonally, and the greatest 24-hour fall was during the March 1993 Storm of the Century. Each year on average, 24 days reach and 16–17 days stay below freezing. The highest recorded temperature was on July 28, 1930, and the lowest was on February 9, 1899.

==Cityscape==

Huntington&#x27;s central business district is directly between the Ohio River and the CSX Railroad tracks, east of the Robert C. Byrd Bridge, and west of Hal Greer Blvd (16th Street). There are also 2 smaller business districts: &quot;Old Central City&quot;, well known for its antique shops, and one in Guyandotte. The city also has a wealth of architecture, including Gothic, Art Deco, and Edwardian Renaissance, along with many Craftsman, Colonial, Classical, and Tudor Revival homes.

Shortly after Pullman Square was constructed, the city began upgrading the streetscape on 9th Street and the &quot;Old Main Corridor&quot; section of 4th Avenue. 9th Street was formerly known as the Ninth Street Plaza and was closed to vehicle traffic for years, which effectively killed most businesses there. Once anchored by Pullman Square on the north end, the old plaza was removed in 2006 and 9th Street has once again begun attracting businesses. The section of Fourth Avenue that connects downtown to Marshall University, known as the &quot;Old Main Corridor&quot;, was also upgraded. The corridor was upgraded with new lighting, artistic and pedestrian-friendly design concepts, and bicycle lanes.

Marshall University purchased the old Anderson-Newcomb/Stone &amp; Thomas Building, which was built in 1902, with the intent of converting that historic structure into a state-of-the-art visual arts center. The goal being to raise the college&#x27;s presence as an innovative institution, give the visual art program more space to expand, and afford students more opportunities to become engaged in community initiatives and improve the quality of life for everyone in the city.

Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/Mississippi River watershed. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the CSX Transportation network. A large portion of the division&#x27;s revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky. The Huntington District is the largest of 10 operating divisions on the network. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX&#x27;s Huntington Division main office is in the historic former C&amp;O passenger station downtown.

Several heavy industrial plants line the Ohio River and the Guyandotte River including the Port of Huntington-Tristate, the largest port in West Virginia and the 17th-largest in the United States. It is the nation&#x27;s second largest inland port. Included in the port&#x27;s area is of the Ohio River from the mouth of the Scioto River in Portsmouth, Ohio to the northern border of Gallia County, Ohio, of the Big Sandy River, and of the Kanawha River.

==Economy==


The growth of Huntington and its economy was originally based on steel processing, shipping, manufacturing, and transportation through the 1970s. The city then experienced deindustrialization, which cost residents tens of thousands of low-skill, high-wage jobs. Huntington has since been adapting to the collapse of the region&#x27;s steel industry. The primary industries have shifted to high technology, such as the film and television industries, health care, biomedical technology, finance, tourism, and the service sector.

Huntington has grown its economic base in recent years to include technology, retail, finance, education, and medical care (which constitutes the largest proportion of the city&#x27;s employment). The largest employers are Marshall University, Cabell Huntington Hospital, St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center, Amazon, DirecTV, and the City of Huntington.

Area retail is anchored by the Huntington Mall, the largest mall in the state, and a healthy downtown retail sector including many boutique shops along the Old Main Corridor, Third Avenue, and Pullman Square.

The newest area of development is Kinetic Park, a premier technology park on Sixteenth Street, 1/4 mile north of Interstate 64. The flagship of the development is Amazon&#x27;s new . Customer Service Center, which opened in November 2011. Other developments in Kinetic Park followed.


The first large manufacturing business in Huntington was the Ensign Car Works, founded in Huntington in 1872 by Ely Ensign and William H. Barnum, who managed a car wheel manufacturing company, the Barnum and Richardson Company, in Connecticut. The company was incorporated on November 1, 1872. Financing was provided primarily by Barnum and Collis P. Huntington, who was one of the principals in the Central Pacific Railroad and founder of the City of Huntington.

For the first ten years of production, Ensign manufactured iron parts such as railroad car wheels. The company began building wooden freight cars in the early 1880s, selling a large portion of its inventory to the Chesapeake and Ohio, Southern Pacific and Central Pacific railroads, all of which were controlled by Huntington. In 1962, the Huntington ACF plant began building a revolutionary new design that quickly became the standard of the rail car industry. The car, known as the CenterFlow covered hopper car, was developed by ACF to transport huge volumes of light-weight, high-bulk commodities, such as plastic pellets. By 1992, ACF had manufactured more than 100,000 hopper cars. The sprawling ACF Industries rail car plant once had many as 1,600 employees with an annual payroll of $30 million. The buildings were demolished in 2024 with the exception of the plants machine shop which is being fully renovated to house the Marshall Advanced Manufacturing Center&#x27;s Welding and Robotics Laboratory in a $6.5 million renovation scheduled to be completed in 2025. The remainder of the now cleared 19.7 acre lot is planned to be renovated into a mixed-use development space.

 Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/Mississippi River watershed. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the CSX Transportation network. A large portion of the division&#x27;s revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of West Virginia and eastern Kentucky. Much of the coal is brought to the Port of Huntington-Tristate by train to be transported by river barges to industrial centers in other states.

Huntington is in the company&#x27;s Southern Region and is the largest of ten operating divisions on the network. The division comprises the former railroads Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O); Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O); Western Maryland (WM); Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N); and the Clinchfield. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio. CSX&#x27;s Huntington Division main office is in the historical former C&amp;O passenger station downtown. The office is home to a regional office that is home to the divisions&#x27;s top managers, a centralized yardmasters and train dispatchers center, a freight car light repair shop and a locomotive heavy repair facility in the city.

Huntington is also home to Heiner&#x27;s Bakery. Founded in 1905, Heiner&#x27;s employs nearly 500 people in its facility. The bakery was privately owned by the Heiner family and marketed exclusively under the &quot;Heiner&#x27;s&quot; label until it was acquired by the Earthgrains division of Anheuser-Busch in 1994. Six months later, A-B spun off its bread business as the stand-alone Earthgrains Corporation. In 2000, Earthgrains merged with the Sara Lee Corporation. In 2011, Sara Lee sold its bread business, including the trademark Sara Lee, to the worldwide Grupo Bimbo, which is based in Mexico City. Today the bakery markets under the &quot;Heiner&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Earthgrains&quot;, &quot;Sara Lee&quot; and &quot;Bimbo&quot; brands.

Huntington is still a base for the metalworking and welding trades with the repair of railroad rolling stock, barges, and river boat equipment. Major fabricating firms—such as the Special Metals Corporation plant, Steel of West Virginia, Martin Steel, Huntington Plating, Richwood Industries, Evans Welding and Fabricating Co, and Hammers Industries—serve the railroads, river transportation, steelmaking, coal, oil, natural gas, electrical, windpower, biofuel, and other important industries.

==Culture==
Huntington is influenced by Appalachian Culture, Southern culture, Midwestern culture, and Mid-Atlantic culture. The 2006 Warner Bros. motion picture &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;, the 2010 ABC series &quot;Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Food Revolution&quot;, the 2017 television series &quot;My Brother, My Brother and Me&quot;, and the Netflix documentary &quot;Heroin(e)&quot; were all filmed in the city.
Arguably, the most famous attraction in Huntington is Keith-Albee Theatre, a former Vaudeville palace in the &quot;Art Deco&quot; style from the 1920s and one of the architectural masterpieces of Downtown Huntington, on Fourth Avenue. Now known as the Keith Albee Performing Arts Center, the Keith was originally built in 1928 as the Keith-Albee Theatre, and under the supervision of vaudeville tycoons B. F. Keith and Edward Albee as part of their Keith-Albee vaudeville circuit, the Keith-Albee was the second-largest theater in the United States at that time, behind the Roxy in New York City. The theater was designed by Thomas W. Lamb who designed approximately 153 theaters around the world. Only forty-three of these grand theaters are still open, and seventy-one have been demolished. &quot;The Keith&quot; has been undergoing a full restoration since 2009. This included the restoration of the famous front sign in 2012. After standing over Fourth Avenue for decades and being featured in hundreds of pictures and postcards, two Hollywood movie premieres, and being struck by lightning numerous times; the sign had to be taken down in 2011. A massive &quot;Save Our Sign&quot; effort was organized to fund the full restoration of the sign, which was reinstalled in May 2012.

Cam&#x27;s Ham is a restaurant located along the rails of Huntington Station. Known as the &quot;Home of the Original Sugar-Flaked Ham&quot;, Cam&#x27;s Ham was listed on the Food Network&#x27;s 50 States 50 Sandwiches list as having the best sandwich in West Virginia.

==Transportation==
===Highways===
The primary roadways of Huntington include one major Interstate, Interstate 64 (I-64); two U.S. Highways, U.S. Route 60 (US 60) and US 52; six state routes; and numerous major thoroughfares. Huntington utilizes a grid-like street pattern featuring several wide boulevard-style avenues that run east and west. Most notable of these are Third and Fifth avenues. The city has a numbered street naming system, with avenues running east and west (parallel to the Ohio River) and streets running north and south.
* I-64, which skirts the South Hills with four interchanges that serve the city: US 52 (West Huntington Expressway), WV 152/WV 527, WV 10, and US 60. Exits 6 through 15 service the City of Huntington. US 52 is at exit 6.
* I-73 and I-74 are programmed to run concurrently with US 52 throughout western West Virginia. It is slated to use the Tolsia Highway near Kenova and the West Huntington Expressway near West Huntington&#x27;s Old Central City neighborhood.
* US 60 is part of the historic Midland Trail that enters the city coming from Barboursville in the east at exit 11 off I-64. US 60 heads toward downtown, splitting into the 3rd and 5th avenues, just west of the WV 2 terminus. US 60 parallels the Ohio River through downtown, and merges into a four-lane undivided highway after crossing under the West Huntington Expressway (US 52) in the West End. US 60 exits the city in the west near the Camden Park.
* US 52 (West Huntington Expressway) is a four-lane expressway that enters Huntington from Ohio via the West Huntington Bridge from Chesapeake, Ohio, in the north, and heads south crossing US 60 in the West End. US 52 then turns west, overlapping I-64 beginning at exit 6, just south of Huntington city limits. US 52 and I-64 stay concurrent for in an easterly direction until reaching Exit 1, signed as the Kenova-Ceredo exit. Along with West Virginia Route 75, US 52 heads south from the intersection, paralleling the Big Sandy River and US 23, which parallels the river on the Kentucky side of the river. From south of Kenova, it is known as the Tolsia Highway for many miles through Wayne County.
* West Virginia Route 2 (WV 2) has its southern terminus just north of Huntington at US 60. WV 2, which parallels the entirety of West Virginia&#x27;s section of the Ohio River, facilitates much traffic towards Point Pleasant and Parkersburg.
* WV 10 follows the Guyandotte River for much of its length and connects Huntington to Princeton. It enters the city south of I-64 at Hal Greer Boulevard. North of I-64 the highway is known as 16th Street. The highway&#x27;s northern terminus is in downtown just south of the Ohio River at US 60, near Marshall University.
* WV 101 is an unsigned highway which runs for less than a mile, connecting Third Avenue (US 60) with Rotary Park. Until 1990, this was an alignment of US 60.
* WV 106 enters the Huntington neighborhood of Guyandotte, via the East End Bridge from Proctorville. The highway crosses WV 2, and immediately terminates at US 60, across the 3rd and 5th avenue split.
* WV 152&#x27;s northern terminus is just shy of the city at I-64. Continuing north, it changes to WV 527.
* WV 527 crosses south into Huntington from Chesapeake, Ohio, via the Robert C. Byrd Bridge. WV 527 then travels through downtown as 5th Street and exits the city at I-64, which serves as the highway&#x27;s southern terminus. Continuing south will lead into WV 152.

===Bridges===
The city has connections over the Ohio River to Proctorville, Ohio, via the East Huntington Bridge, and to Chesapeake, Ohio, via the Robert C. Byrd Bridge and the West Huntington Bridge.

The Robert C. Byrd Bridge is a continuous truss automobile bridge that crosses the Ohio River between Huntington and Chesapeake, Ohio. It was named after United States Senator Robert C. Byrd, who is credited with obtaining the funding for the project that was completed on November 6, 1994, at a cost of $32.6 million.

The previous bridge, known as the 6th Street Bridge, opened in 1926 and was Huntington&#x27;s first bridge across the Ohio River. Designed in a gothic style, complete with four two-ton spires that rested on top of each peak. The spires were saved; one is currently on display outside of the Chesapeake city hall at the intersection of State Route 7 (SR 7) and the Robert C. Byrd Bridge. Two others are installed along 9th Street between 3rd and 5th Avenues.

The East Huntington Bridge (officially the &quot;Frank Gatski Memorial Bridge&quot;, also called the &quot;East End Bridge&quot; or the &quot;31st Street Bridge&quot;) is a cable-stayed bridge crossing the Ohio River at Huntington. It carries WV 106 on the West Virginia approach and SR 775 on the Ohio approach. Work began on the bridge in 1983 and was completed in August 1985 at a cost of $38 million. The bridge was renamed for Marshall University&#x27;s first member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Frank &quot;Gunner&quot; Gatski, during halftime of the Marshall-UTEP Football game on November 18, 2006.

===Rail===
Since its founding as the western terminus of the C&amp;O Railroad, Huntington has served as a major break of bulk point between rail traffic and the Ohio River/Mississippi River watershed. The Huntington Division is still the largest in the CSX Transportation network. A large portion of the division&#x27;s revenue comes from hauling coal out of the coalfields of West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky. Much of the coal is brought to the Port of Huntington-Tristate by train to be transported by river barges to industrial centers in other parts of the United States.

Huntington is in the company&#x27;s Southern Region and is the largest of ten operating divisions on the network. The division comprises the former railroads Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O); Baltimore and Ohio (B&amp;O); Western Maryland (WM); Louisville and Nashville (L&amp;N); and the Clinchfield. It serves the states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Ohio. CSX&#x27;s Huntington Division main office is in the historical former C&amp;O passenger station in downtown Huntington. The building is home to the division&#x27;s top managers, a centralized yardmasters and train dispatchers center, a freight car light repair shop, and a locomotive heavy repair facility in the city.

The city was once a major hub for passenger rail service, but it now accounts for a significantly smaller portion of rail traffic than in the early decades of the 20th century. The Amtrak station is on the &quot;Cardinal&quot; line running three days a week between New York City and Chicago.

===Public transit===

TTA provides fixed-route bus service throughout Huntington and the surrounding area. Its buses range, on the West Virginia side from 19th Street West in Huntington to Milton, West Virginia, about to the east. On the Ohio side, the buses range from downtown Ironton to the Huntington suburb of Proctorville, Ohio, which is also a range of about . Interchange buses provide links between Huntington and Chesapeake, Ohio, and between Ironton and Ashland, Kentucky, where transfers are available to the Ashland Bus System. However the system does not interchange between the TTA and the City of Ashland Bus Service in Ceredo, West Virginia.

The TTA also was involved in a joint venture with the Charleston-based Kanawha Valley Regional Transportation Authority bus system called Intelligent Transit which linked downtown Huntington to Charleston via bus. All bus routes began and ended at the old Greyhound Bus Depot in downtown Huntington, which is now known as the TTA Center. The service from Huntington to Charleston ceased in 2015. TTA bus services operate on Monday to Saturday between 6:00 a.m. and 11:15 p.m.

===River===

The Port of Huntington-Tristate is the largest inland port in the United States in terms of total tonnage and ton-miles. This is due in large part to the coal traffic from the railroads and the petroleum products produced by the Marathon Petroleum oil refinery in nearby Catlettsburg, Kentucky, that use the Port of Huntington/Tri-State to load their products onto barges.

===Air===
The public Tri-State Airport, southwest of the city, has two runways. Commercial air service is provided by Allegiant Air and American Eagle. Huntington also holds the privately owned airport Robert Newlon Field, which serves the Huntington–Ashland metropolitan area area.

The two largest hospitals in Huntington are St. Mary&#x27;s Medical Center and Cabell Huntington Hospital. St. Mary&#x27;s and Cabell Huntington, both owned and operated by Mountain Health Network, are jointly designated as the only trauma center in the region. St. Mary&#x27;s is the largest medical facility in Huntington and the second largest in the tri-state region at 393 beds. The medical center is the largest private employer in Cabell County with over 2,600 employees. As a teaching facility associated with the Marshall University Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine, St. Mary&#x27;s trains medical residents in several specialties. The hospital campus is home to the St. Mary&#x27;s School of Nursing, the St. Mary&#x27;s School of Radiologic Technology, and the St. Mary&#x27;s School of Respiratory Care. All three programs are associated with Marshall University. St. Mary&#x27;s is also home to a regional heart institute, regional cancer center, and regional neuroscience center. Huntington also holds multiple Psychiatric hospital&#x27;s, including the 187-bed River Park Hospital.

Cabell Huntington Hospital is a not-for-profit, regional referral center with 303 staffed beds. Cabell Huntington cares for patients from more than 29 counties throughout West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. Opened in 1956, it is also a teaching hospital and home to the Marshall University Medical Center, which includes the Joan C. Edwards Schools of Medicine and Nursing. Cabell Huntington is also home to the Edwards Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Hoops Family Children&#x27;s Hospital, and the Robert C. Byrd Center for Rural Health; a distinguished leader nationwide for rural healthcare delivery.
The Huntington Veteran&#x27;s Administration (VA) Medical Center, on Spring Valley Drive, is an 80-bed medical and surgical care facility that offers primary inpatient and outpatient care, along with mental health services and subspeciality outpatient options. It is also the primary teaching facility for the Marshall University School of Medicine and is also affiliated with the University of Pikeville Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine. In 1993, the Robert C. Byrd Clinical Addition expanded the hospital&#x27;s surgery, radiology, laboratory, cardiology, nuclear medicine, and rehabilitation services and renovated inpatient care facilities. In 1998, a $10 million research facility was completed. The hospital is also the home of the Marshall University School of Pharmacy.

<text>William &#x27;Strata&#x27; Smith (23 March 1769 – 28 August 1839) was an English geologist, credited with creating the first detailed, nationwide geological map of any country. At the time his map was first published he was overlooked by the scientific community; his relatively humble education and family connections prevented him from mixing easily in learned society. Financially ruined, Smith spent time in debtors&#x27; prison. It was only late in his life that Smith received recognition for his accomplishments, and became known as the &quot;Father of English Geology&quot;.

==Early life==
Smith was born on 23 March 1769, in Churchill, Oxfordshire, the son of John Smith (1735–1777), the village blacksmith, and his wife Ann (&quot;née&quot; Smith; 1745–1807). His father died when Smith was eight years old, and he and his siblings were raised by his uncle, a farmer also named William Smith. Largely self-educated, Smith was intelligent and observant, read widely from an early age, and showed an aptitude for mathematics and drawing. In 1787, he met and found work as an assistant for Edward Webb of Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, a surveyor. He was quick to learn and soon became proficient at the trade.

In 1791, Smith travelled to Somerset to make a valuation survey of the Sutton Court estate, and building on earlier work in the same area by John Strachey. He stayed in the area for the next eight years, working first for Webb and later for the Somersetshire Coal Canal Company, living at Rugborne Farm in High Littleton. During this period, Smith inspected coal mines in the area, where he first observed and recorded the various layers of rock and coal exposed by the mining. Smith&#x27;s coal mine studies, combined with his subsequent observations of the strata exposed by canal excavations, proved crucial to the formation of his theories of stratigraphy.

==Life&#x27;s work==

Smith worked at one of the estate&#x27;s older mines, the Mearns Pit at High Littleton, part of the Somerset coalfield and the Somerset Coal Canal. As he observed the rock layers (or strata) at the pit, he realised that they were arranged in a predictable pattern and that the various strata could always be found in the same relative positions. Additionally, each particular stratum could be identified by the fossils it contained, and the same succession of fossil groups from older to younger rocks could be found in many parts of England. Furthermore, he noticed an easterly dip of the beds of rock—low near the surface (about three degrees), then higher after the Triassic rocks. This gave Smith a testable hypothesis, which he termed The Principle of Faunal Succession, and he began his search to determine if the relationships between the strata and their characteristics were consistent throughout the country. During subsequent travels, first as a surveyor (appointed by noted engineer John Rennie) for the canal company until 1799 when he was dismissed, and later, he was continually taking samples and mapping the locations of the various strata, and displaying the vertical extent of the strata, and drawing cross-sections and tables of what he saw. This would earn him the name &quot;Strata Smith&quot;. As a natural consequence, Smith amassed a large and valuable collection of fossils of the strata he had examined himself from exposures in canals, road and railway cuttings, quarries and escarpments across the country. He also developed methods for the identification of deposits of Fuller&#x27;s earth to the south of Bath, Somerset.

He published his findings with many pictures from his fossil collection, enabling others to investigate their distribution and test his theories. His collection is especially good on Jurassic fossils he collected from the Cornbrash, Kimmeridge Clay, Oxford Clay, Oolitic limestone and other horizons in the sequence. They included many types of brachiopods, ammonites and molluscs characteristic of the shallow seas in which they were deposited. Some of the names he coined (like Cornbrash) are still used today for this formation.

It could be seen from Smith&#x27;s findings that the deeper – and therefore older – the strata were, the more the fossilised species within them differed from living organisms. This gave great support and impetus to the hypothesis of biological evolution (which pre-dated the work of Charles Darwin).

==Publication and disappointment==
In 1799, Smith produced the first large-scale geological map of the area around Bath. Previously, he only knew how to draw the &quot;vertical&quot; extent of the rocks, but not how to display them &quot;horizontally&quot;. However, in the Somerset &quot;County Agricultural Society&quot;, he found a map showing the types of soils and vegetation around Bath and their geographical extent. Importantly, the differing types were coloured. Using this technique, Smith could draw a geological map from his observations showing the outcrops of the rocks. He took a few rock types, each with its own colour. Then he estimated the boundaries of each of the outcrops of rock, filled them in with colour and ended up with a crude geological map.

In 1801, he drew a rough sketch of what would become the first geological map of most of Great Britain. In the same year he claimed that a book he proposed to publish would provide geological information to enable the canal engineer to &quot;choose his stratum, find the most appropriate materials, avoid slippery ground, or remedy the evil&quot;. The book was never published however. Smith travelled extensively across Great Britain working as a mineral surveyor allowing him to meet prominent people such as Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, and the Duke of Bedford. 

In 1815, Smith published his geological map, coloured on an especially prepared base map by John Cary at a scale of 5 miles to the inch and titled &quot;&#x27;A delineation of the Strata of England and Wales, with part of Scotland.&#x27;&quot; While this was not the world&#x27;s first geological map (a map of the United States by William Maclure was published six years earlier), Smith&#x27;s was the first geological map covering such a large area in detail, and is one of the first stratigraphical analyses to utilize palaeontological indices. Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological strata were indicated by different colours, applied to the map by hand. Smith used a graded colouring method applying a bolder colour to the edge representing the base of each stratum, thus depicting its stratigraphical relations. The map is similar to modern geological maps of England (albeit today&#x27;s maps use flat-colouring) reflecting its general accuracy in the eastern and south eastern regions of the country. However Smith&#x27;s geology of western part of England and Wales was much less detailed and accurate. Smith included a &quot;&#x27;Sketch of the succession of STRATA and their relative Altitudes&quot;&#x27; on the map, showing the disposition of strata from London to the mountains of Snowdonia. This was not a new technique in itself, but its appearance on a map, with the clear intention of illustrating the relationship between relief and rocks and their structure, was novel. 

In his book &quot;Strata Identified by Organized Fossils&quot; (London 1816–1819), Smith recognised that strata contained distinct fossil assemblages which could be used to match rocks across regions. In 1817, he drew a remarkable geological section from Snowdon to London, a development of the ‘sketch&#x27; on his map, illustrating the three-dimensional relationship between geology and landscape via a perspective sketch of the landscape showing the topography. Effectively this was the first block diagram, now routinely used in geography textbooks and animations.

A common narrative in some recent accounts of Smith&#x27;s life and his map asserts that rivalry built up between Smith and the first President of the Geological Society, George Bellas Greenough, who was also engaged in producing a geological map of England and Wales. However original sources point to this narrative not being the case and indicate Smith was used by John Farey Sr., another &#x27;practical man&#x27; (i.e. mineral surveyor), to prosecute Farey&#x27;s own grievances against the Geological Society in an article in &quot;The Philosophical Magazine&quot; by which he both started and fuelled the story that Smith was disrespected and there was ill-feeling towards him by the Geological Society men and Greenough in particular. In the following issue Greenough replied, publicly declaring his view as being non-antagonistic by stating:

Another common but misleading narrative in some recent accounts of Smith&#x27;s map has Greenough&#x27;s 1820 map undercutting the price and sales of Smith&#x27;s map, thereby citing Greenough as a primary cause of landing Smith in debtor&#x27;s prison. However, Greenough&#x27;s map could not have contributed to the debts for which Smith was consigned to prison as the Greenough map, although dated 1819 on the map, was not published until May 1820, after Smith&#x27;s incarceration. In fact Smith&#x27;s maps retailed at 5 guineas, which was the same price as that privileged to Geological Society members for purchase of the Greenough 1820 map. However the Greenough map retailed to public at 6 guineas, thereby being a more expensive purchase than Smith&#x27;s map. Also, although neither map sold well, the number of sales of Smith&#x27;s map appears to have topped those of Greenough&#x27;s map (only 196 copies recorded as sold) and there are only 15 names in common between Smith&#x27;s subscribers&#x27; list and the list of those who bought the Geological Society&#x27;s map.

Smith&#x27;s various projects, starting with a mortgage taken to purchase his estate at Tucking Mill in Somerset in 1798, accrued financial commitments that ran into a series of difficulties which he managed to withstand by borrowing money from sympathetic creditors and mortgagors and funding repayments by taking on a relentless schedule of work commissions between 1801 and 1819. However a project to quarry Bath Stone near his property, for sale to the London property development market, failed to return the significant investment it had required due to poor quality stone and Smith found himself in default to co-investor Charles Conolly. Smith had used his Bath estate as security against Conolly&#x27;s loan but there was excess to pay. In attempting to stave off his debt Smith sold his &#x27;fossil collection&#x27; to the British Museum for £700, but this proved insufficient and funds fell short of the sum owed to Conolly by £300 and as a consequence Smith was sent to debtors&#x27; prison in 1819. Through all this financial turmoil, Smith managed to publish his map and subsequent associated publications but in 1817 he remarked &quot;My income is as yet not anywise improved by what has been done, the profits being required to liquidate the debt incurred by publication.&quot;

On 31 August 1819, Smith was released from King&#x27;s Bench Prison in London, a debtor&#x27;s prison. He returned to 15 Buckingham Street, his home since 1804, to find a bailiff at the door and his home and property seized. Smith then worked as an itinerant surveyor for many years until one of his employers, Sir John Johnstone, recognised his work and talent and took steps to gain for him the respect he deserved, appointing Smith as Land Steward to his estate in Hackness near Scarborough. Between 1824 and 1834, Smith lived and was based in Hackness, then moving to Scarborough where he was responsible for the design of the Rotunda, a geological museum devoted to the Yorkshire coast, creating the cylindrical layout and arrangement of fossil display on sloping shelves.

==Later recognition==
It was not until February 1831 that the Geological Society of London conferred on Smith the first Wollaston Medal in recognition of his achievement. It was on this occasion that the President, Adam Sedgwick, referred to Smith as &quot;the Father of English Geology&quot;. That year Smith was awarded a pension of £100 a year by King William IV. In 1835 Smith travelled to Dublin for the meeting of the British Association, and there unexpectedly received an honorary Doctorate of Laws (LL.D.) from Trinity College.

By 1841, the Institution of Civil Engineers had begun to promote the use of geological models in the design of civil engineering projects, with Smith&#x27;s work and status as &quot;Father of Geology&quot; referenced by Thomas Sopwith in an address to the Institution that year.

In 1838, Smith was appointed as one of the commissioners to select building-stone for the new Palace of Westminster. He died in Northampton on 28 August 1839, aged 70, and is buried a few feet from the west tower of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Northampton, now a redundant church. The inscription on the grave is badly worn but the name &quot;William Smith&quot; can just be seen. Inside St Peter&#x27;s Church is an impressive bust and inscription.Subsequent modern geological maps have been based on Smith&#x27;s original work, of which several copies have survived including one which has been put on display (alongside the Greenough map) at the Geological Society of London which can be visited by the public, free and without an appointment.

<text>Don Richard Ashburn (March 19, 1927September 9, 1997), also known by the nicknames &quot;Putt-Putt&quot;, &quot;the Tilden Flash&quot;, and &quot;Whitey&quot; (due to his light-blond hair), was an American professional baseball player and television sports commentator. He played in Major League Baseball as a center fielder from 1948 to 1962, most prominently as a member of the Philadelphia Phillies, where he was a four-time All-Star player and member of the 1950 National League pennant winning Whiz Kids.

Ashburn was a two-time National League (NL) batting champion, and finished with a .308 career batting average. He also excelled as a defensive player, routinely leading the league in putouts. His 5,803 career putouts ranks third among center fielders in Major League Baseball history behind only Willie Mays and Tris Speaker. He ended his playing career with the Chicago Cubs and the New York Mets.

Following his playing career, from 1963 until his death in 1997, Ashburn was a color commentator for television broadcasts of Philadelphia Phillies games, and developed into one of the most beloved sports figures in Philadelphia sports history. In 1995, following a lengthy fan-led effort for his inclusion, Ashburn was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In 1997, he was inducted into The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame. He was posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.

==Career==
===Early baseball career===
Ashburn was born in Tilden, Nebraska. His mother gave birth twice, each time to twins; Richie and sister Donna were the younger pair. He began playing baseball in 1935 in the Tilden Midget Baseball League when he was eight-years-old. He played as a catcher because his father advised him that it would be the fastest route to becoming a major league player.

Ashburn played baseball and basketball for Tilden High School then graduated to American Legion Baseball with the Neligh Junior Legion team while continuing to play as a catcher. At the 1944 American Legion Junior Baseball East/West All-Star game at the Polo Grounds, Philadelphia Athletics manager Connie Mack advised him to play another position due to his remarkable running speed.

Ashburn signed a contract with the Cleveland Indians in 1943 at the age of 16, but Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis voided the contract because the rules then prohibited the signing of players who were still attending high school. He then signed a contract with the Chicago Cubs to play for their Nashville farm team in 1944, but Landis nullified the Cubs contract because of an illegal clause that would have paid Ashburn if the Nashville franchise was sold while he was playing there. After the two contracts were nullified, Ashburn decided to enroll at Norfolk Junior College. After one semester, however, he signed a contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. Unlike the first two attempts, this one stuck.

In 1945, at the age of eighteen, Ashburn made his professional baseball debut with the Utica Blue Sox of the Eastern League. It was there that his manager, Eddie Sawyer, converted him into a center fielder, taking advantage of his impressive running speed. During his time with the Utica Blue Sox, Ashburn&#x27;s teammates began calling him &quot;Whitey&quot; because of his light blond hair, a nickname which stayed with him for the rest of his life.

Ashburn was drafted by the United States Army early in the 1945 season. He was allowed to finish the season, however, in which the Blue Sox won the Eastern League pennant. Ashburn led the team with a .312 batting average. He served with the Army in Alaska in 1946, then returned to the Blue Sox in 1947, where his team once again won the Eastern League championship. Ashburn finished with the second best batting average in the Eastern League at .362. His 191 hits (in 137 games) set a league record for the most hits in a season. After the 1947 season, he returned to Norfolk Junior College for a second semester, where he met his future wife, Herberta Cox.

===Major League Baseball===

The Phillies purchased Ashburn&#x27;s contract from their Toronto minor league affiliate on April 8, 1948, Ashburn made his major league debut with the Phillies on Opening Day 1948 as a 21-year-old rookie. He started as the left fielder and replaced veteran Harry Walker, the reigning NL batting champion, as the team’s leadoff hitter. He played as a left fielder for the first 12 games of the season before replacing Walker as the regular center fielder.

By June 5, Ashburn had produced a .380 batting average and had a 23-game hitting streak while his level of defensive play had impressed Shibe Park spectators. Ashburn was the only rookie chosen to the 1948 National League All-Star team where, he hit a single on the first pitch of the game and scored the first run of the game.

In 1950, in the last game of the regular season, Ashburn threw out Cal Abrams of the Brooklyn Dodgers at home plate to preserve a 1–1 tie and set the stage for Dick Sisler&#x27;s pennant-clinching home run that sent the Phillies to the 1950 World Series. In the play, Ashburn was positioned in to back up a pick-off throw on a pitchout, but Phillies&#x27; pitcher Robin Roberts instead threw a fastball to the Dodgers&#x27; Duke Snider.

The following year Ashburn displayed his fielding skill on the national stage in the All-Star Game at Tiger Stadium in Detroit. The Associated Press reported, &quot;Richie Ashburn, fleet footed Philadelphia Phillies outfielder, brought the huge Briggs Stadium crowd of 52,075 to its feet with a brilliant leaping catch in the sixth inning to rob Vic Wertz of a near homer. Ashburn caught the ball in front of the right centerfield screen 400 feet distant after a long run.&quot; He was also the last Phillies player to collect eight hits in a double-header when he singled eight times in a twinbill at Pittsburgh on May 20, 1951.

Ashburn was a singles hitter rather than a slugger, accumulating over 2,500 hits in 15 years against only 29 home runs. In his day he was regarded as the archetypal &quot;spray hitter&quot;, stroking the ball equally well to all fields, thus making him harder to defend against. Ashburn accumulated the most hits (1,875) of any batter during the 1950s.

Ted Williams gave Ashburn the nickname &quot;Putt-Putt&quot; because he &quot;ran so fast you would think he had twin motors in his pants&quot;. The origin of the nickname also has been attributed to Stan Musial.

During a game on August 17, 1957, Ashburn hit a foul ball into the stands that struck spectator Alice Roth, wife of &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; sports editor Earl Roth, breaking her nose. When play resumed Ashburn fouled off another ball that struck her while she was being carried off in a stretcher. Ashburn and Roth maintained a friendship for many years, and the Roths&#x27; son later served as a Phillies batboy. 1958 marked the ninth year he had over four hundred putouts as an outfielder, a record.

Ashburn was traded to the Chicago Cubs following the 1959 season for three players. He went on to anchor center field for the North Siders in 1960 and 1961. Anticipating a future career behind a microphone, Ashburn sometimes conducted a post-game baseball instruction clinic at Wrigley Field for the benefit of the youngsters in the WGN-TV viewing audience.

Ashburn was purchased by the expansion New York Mets for the 1962 season and was the first batter in franchise history. He had a good year offensively, batting .306, and was the team&#x27;s first All-Star Game representative. It was, however, a frustrating year for the polished professional, who had begun his career with a winner and found himself playing for the least successful team in modern baseball history (with a record of 40–120), a record of futility unmatched for another 62 years that followed, until it was finally surpassed by the 2024 Chicago White Sox.

Ashburn retired after the 1962 season.

One oft-told story is that on short flies to center or left-center, center fielder Ashburn would collide with shortstop Elio Chacón. Chacón, from Venezuela, spoke little English and had difficulty understanding when Ashburn was calling him off the ball. To remedy matters teammate Joe Christopher taught Ashburn to say &quot;Yo la tengo&quot;, Spanish for &quot;I’ve got it.&quot; When Ashburn first used this phrase it worked fine, keeping Chacón from running into him. But then left fielder Frank Thomas, who did not speak a word of Spanish, slammed into Ashburn. After getting up Thomas asked Ashburn, &quot;What the heck is a Yellow Tango?&quot; This anecdote inspired the name of the American indie rock group Yo La Tengo.

In his last five seasons, Ashburn played for the 8th-place Phillies, the 7th-place Cubs and, in his final year, the 1962 10th-place Mets. That infamous first-year Mets club won only a quarter of its games; after the season Ashburn decided to retire from active play. The last straw might have been during the Mets&#x27; 120th loss, when Ashburn, in the final game of his career, was involved in a triple play in the 8th inning pulled off by his former teammates, the 9th-place Cubs. According to Jimmy Breslin, it was the prospect of sitting on the bench that led Ashburn to retire: &quot;He sat on the bench for a while with another team once and it bothered him badly. And he said that if he ever had to be a benchwarmer for the New York Mets he&#x27;d commit suicide.&quot;

Throughout his playing career, Ashburn, who lived in his hometown of Tilden during the offseason, officiated high school basketball games throughout Nebraska as a way to stay in playing condition. He became a well-respected official, but retired from officiating when he retired from baseball.

==Broadcasting career==

Starting in 1963, Ashburn became a radio and TV color commentator for the Phillies, his original big-league team. He first worked with long-time Phillies announcers Bill Campbell and Byrum Saam. In 1971 Campbell was released by the Phillies and replaced by Harry Kalas. From 1971 to 1976, Ashburn worked together with Saam and Kalas who would both be Ford C. Frick Award winners. Saam retired in 1976, and Ashburn continued working with Kalas for the next two decades, the two growing to be best friends. Kalas often referred to Ashburn as &quot;His Whiteness&quot;, a nickname Kalas used for most of Ashburn&#x27;s life for the man he openly adored.

He was well known for his dry humor as a broadcaster. On one occasion, he was talking to Harry Kalas about his superstitions during his playing days. He said that he once had a habit of keeping a successful baseball bat in bed with him between games, not trusting the clubhouse crew to give him the same bat the next day. Ashburn told Kalas that he had &quot;slept with a lot of old bats&quot; in his day.

When calling late innings, Ashburn would occasionally ask on-air if the staff of Celebre&#x27;s Pizza, a nearby pizzeria in South Philadelphia, was listening to the radio. Pizza would then arrive at the radio booth 15–20 minutes later. The Phillies requested that Ashburn discontinue the practice, since Celebre&#x27;s was not a Phillies sponsor and it was considered free advertising. However, Ashburn was allowed to make on-air birthday and anniversary wishes during Phillies games. To circumvent the Phillies&#x27; request, he started to say, &quot;I&#x27;d like to send out a special birthday wish to the Celebre&#x27;s twins – Plain &amp; Pepperoni!&quot; Harry Kalas was heard on radio in 2007 making a similar wish.

Ashburn regularly wrote columns on the Phillies and Major League Baseball for the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; and the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;.

==Death==
According to Ashburn&#x27;s mother, he planned to retire from broadcasting at the end of the 1997 season. On September 9, 1997, hours after broadcasting a Phillies-Mets game at Shea Stadium, Ashburn died from an apparent heart attack at his hotel room at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Manhattan, aged 70. A large crowd of fans paid tribute to him, passing by his casket in Memorial Hall, located in Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairmount Park. He is interred in the suburban Gladwyne Methodist Church Cemetery in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania in suburban Philadelphia.

==Legacy==

The book, &quot;Richie Ashburn: Why The Hall Not?&quot;, is about Richie&#x27;s journey to the Baseball Hall of Fame; Ashburn was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Hall&#x27;s Veterans Committee in 1995 after a long fan campaign to induct him, which included bumper stickers that read, &quot;Richie Ashburn: Why The Hall Not?&quot; He accompanied Phillies great Mike Schmidt, who was inducted in the same ceremony. Over 25,000 fans, mostly from the Philadelphia area, traveled to Cooperstown, New York for the ceremony.

Ashburn was inducted into The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia Hall of Fame in 1997. He was posthumously inducted into the inaugural class of the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame in 2004.

Each year, the Phillies present the Richie Ashburn Special Achievement Award to &quot;a member of the organization who has demonstrated loyalty, dedication and passion for the game.&quot;

The center field entertainment area at Citizens Bank Park, the Phillies&#x27; home stadium, is named Ashburn Alley in his honor after numerous fans urged the Phillies to name their new stadium after Ashburn. Ashburn&#x27;s 47 seasons of service to the Phillies organization was second in length in Philadelphia baseball history only to Connie Mack, who was honored by the renaming of Shibe Park as Connie Mack Park in 1953.

At Citizens Bank Park, the Phillies&#x27; radio broadcast booth is named the Richie &#x27;Whitey&#x27; Ashburn Broadcast Booth in Ashburn&#x27;s honor. It is directly next to the television broadcast booth, which was renamed &quot;The Harry Kalas Broadcast Booth&quot; after Kalas&#x27;s death in 2009.

Rubén Amaro Jr., former general manager of the Phillies and son of former Phillies shortstop and coach Rubén Amaro Sr., co-founded the Richie Ashburn Foundation, which provides admission to baseball camp for free to 1,100 underprivileged children in the Delaware Valley and awards grants to area schools and colleges.

<text>St. Lawrence County is a county in the U.S. state of New York. As of the 2020 census, the population was 108,505. The county seat is Canton.
The county is named for the Saint Lawrence River. This was as named by early French explorer Jacques Cartier for the Christian saint Lawrence of Rome, as he visited the river on the saint&#x27;s feast day. The county is part of the North Country region of the state.

St. Lawrence County comprises the Ogdensburg-Massena, NY Micropolitan Statistical Area and is New York&#x27;s largest county by area.

== History ==

When counties were established by England in the Province of New York in 1683, the present St. Lawrence County was part of Albany County. This was an enormous territory, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. The county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766, by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770, by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont.

On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. The other two were called Tryon County (later renamed Montgomery County) and Charlotte County (later renamed Washington County).

Tryon County contained the western portion (and, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County included what are now 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York. Charlotte County contained the eastern portion of Albany County.

In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name &quot;Charlotte County&quot; was changed to Washington County to honor George Washington, the American Revolutionary War general and later President of the United States of America. Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died trying to capture the city of Quebec. It replaced the name of the British governor, hated by the rebels.

In 1788, Clinton County was split off from Washington County. This was a much larger area than the present Clinton County, including part of what would later become St. Lawrence County, as well as several other counties or county parts of the present New York State.

In 1789, the size of Montgomery County was reduced by the splitting off of Ontario County from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne Counties.

St. Lawrence County is part of Macomb&#x27;s Purchase of 1791.

In 1791, Herkimer County was one of three counties split off from Montgomery (the other two being Otsego, and Tioga County). This was much larger than the present county, however, and was reduced by a number of subsequent splits. The first was the splitting off in 1794 of Onondaga County. This county was larger than the current Onondaga County, including the present Cayuga, Cortland, and part of Oswego Counties. This was followed by the splitting off in 1798 from Herkimer County of two portions: one, Oneida County, was larger than the current Oneida County, including the present Jefferson, Lewis, and part of Oswego Counties; another portion, together with a portion of Tioga County, was taken to form Chenango County.

In 1799, Clinton County was reduced in size by the splitting off of Essex County from Clinton County.

In 1802, parts of Clinton, Herkimer, and Montgomery counties were taken to form the new St. Lawrence County. At that time Ogdensburg was the county seat. In 1828 the county seat was moved to Canton. The selection of Canton as the county seat was a compromise by the state legislature to end competition between factions supporting Ogdensburg and Potsdam for the county seat.

===Earthquake===
On September 5, 1944, a 5.8magnitude earthquake centered in Massena struck the county. The earthquake was felt from Canada to Maryland, and from Maine to Indiana. The earthquake was the strongest earthquake in New York State history.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (5.0%) is water.

It is the largest county by area in the state of New York. It is larger than either of the states of Rhode Island (1544.9 square miles) or the state of Delaware (2488.72 square miles). St. Lawrence County is part of the North Country region.

Part of the county is in the Adirondack Park. It includes much of the Oswegatchie River, Cranberry Lake and Lake Ozonia.

The Port of Ogdensburg in St. Lawrence County is the only U.S. port on the St. Lawrence Seaway. This waterway allows ships and vessels to pass through the St. Lawrence River and on to the Great Lakes. Ogdensburg Harbor Light is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, and in the National Register of Historic Places listings in St. Lawrence County, New York

==Politics==












|}

Prior to the 1992 presidential election, St. Lawrence County was a traditionally Republican county, supporting the Democrats only in their sweep of New York State counties in 1964. From 1992 through the 2012 election, St. Lawrence County swung Democratic, posting double-digit victories for Democratic candidates, most notably in 1996 when Bill Clinton won the county by 28-point margin over Bob Dole. The first Republican victory in the county since 1988 came in 2016 when Donald Trump carried the county by an eight-point margin. In 2020, it was one of only a few counties in Upstate New York where Trump improved his margin, this time carrying it by over 10 points.
