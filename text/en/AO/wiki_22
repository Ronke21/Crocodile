<text>The cor anglais (, or original ; plural: &quot;cors anglais&quot;), or English horn (in North American English), is a double-reed woodwind instrument in the oboe family. It is approximately one and a half times the length of an oboe, making it essentially an alto oboe in F.

The cor anglais is a transposing instrument pitched in F, a perfect fifth lower than the oboe (a C instrument). This means that music for the cor anglais is written a perfect fifth higher than the instrument sounds. The fingering and playing technique used for the cor anglais are essentially the same as those of the oboe, and oboists typically double on the cor anglais when required. The cor anglais normally lacks the lowest B key found on most oboes, and so its sounding range stretches from E3 (written B) below middle C to C6 two octaves above middle C. Some versions being made today have a Low B key to extend the range down one more note to sounding E3.

==Description and timbre==
The pear-shaped bell (called Liebesfuß) of the cor anglais gives it a more covered timbre than the oboe, closer in tonal quality to the oboe d&#x27;amore. Whereas the oboe is the soprano instrument of the oboe family, the cor anglais is generally regarded as the alto member of the family, and the oboe d&#x27;amore—pitched between the two in the key of A—as the mezzo-soprano member. The cor anglais is perceived to have a more mellow and plaintive tone than the oboe. The difference in sound results primarily from a wider reed and a conical bore that expands over a greater distance than the oboe&#x27;s; although darker in tone and lower in pitch than the oboe, its sound is distinct from (though naturally blends with) the sound of the bassoon family. Its appearance differs from the oboe in that the instrument is notably longer, the reed is attached to a slightly curved metal tube called the bocal, or crook, and the bell has a bulbous shape (&quot;Liebesfuß&quot;).

The cor anglais is usually notated in the treble clef, a perfect fifth higher than sounding pitch. Alto clef written at sounding pitch is occasionally used, even by as late a composer as Sergei Prokofiev. In late-18th- and early-19th-century Italy, where the instrument was often played by bassoonists instead of oboists, it was notated in the bass clef an octave below sounding pitch (as found in Rossini&#x27;s Overture to &quot;William Tell&quot;). French operatic composers up to Fromental Halévy notated the instrument at sounding pitch in the mezzo-soprano clef, which enabled the player to read the part as if it were in the treble clef.

Although the instrument usually descends only to (written) low B, continental instruments with an extension to low B (sounding E) have existed since early in the 19th century. Examples of works requiring this note (while acknowledging its exceptional nature) include Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Gurre-Lieder&quot;, Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Das Lied von der Erde&quot;, Heitor Villa-Lobos&#x27;s &quot;Chôros No. 6&quot;, and Karlheinz Stockhausen&#x27;s &quot;Zeitmaße&quot;. Antonín Dvořák, in his &quot;Scherzo capriccioso&quot;, even writes for the cor anglais down to low A, though it seems unlikely that such an extension ever existed.

Reeds used to play the cor anglais are similar to those used for an oboe, consisting of a piece of cane folded in two. While the cane on an oboe reed is mounted on a small metal tube (the staple) partially covered in cork, there is no such cork on a cor anglais reed, which fits directly on the bocal. The cane part of the reed is wider and longer than that of the oboe. Unlike American-style oboe reeds, cor anglais reeds typically have some wire at the base, approximately from the top of the string used to attach the cane to the staple. This wire serves to hold the two blades of cane together and stabilize tone and pitch.

Perhaps the best-known makers of modern cors anglais are the French firms of F. Lorée, Marigaux, and Rigoutat, the British firm of T. W. Howarth, and the American firm Fox Products. Instruments from smaller makers, such as A. Laubin, are also sought after. Instruments are usually made from African blackwood ( Grenadilla), although some makers offer instruments in a choice of alternative woods as well, such as cocobolo (Howarth) or violet wood (Lorée), which are said to alter the voice of the cor anglais slightly, producing a more mellow sound. Fox has recently made some instruments in plastic resin and maple, the latter being the wood traditionally used for bassoons.

==History and etymology==

The term &quot;cor anglais&quot; is French for &quot;English horn&quot;, but the instrument is neither from England nor related to the various conical-bore brass instruments called &quot;horns&quot;, such as the French horn, the natural horn, the post horn, or the tenor horn. The instrument originated in Silesia about 1720 when a bulb bell was fitted to a curved &quot;oboe da caccia&quot;-type body by the Weigel family of Breslau. The two-keyed, open-belled, straight tenor oboe (French &quot;taille de hautbois&quot;, &quot;tenor oboe&quot;), and more particularly the flare-belled &quot;oboe da caccia&quot;, resembled the horns played by angels in religious images of the Middle Ages. This gave rise in German-speaking central Europe to the Middle High German name &quot;engellisches Horn&quot;, meaning &quot;angelic horn&quot;. Because &quot;engellisch&quot; also meant &quot;English&quot; in the vernacular of the time, the &quot;angelic horn&quot; became the &quot;English horn&quot;. In the absence of any better alternative, the curved, bulb-belled tenor oboe then retained the name even after the &quot;oboe da caccia&quot; fell into disuse around 1760. The name first appeared regularly in Italian, German, and Austrian scores from 1749 on, usually in the Italian form &quot;corno inglese.&quot;

The earliest known orchestral part specifically for the instrument is in the Vienna version of Niccolò Jommelli&#x27;s opera &quot;Ezio&quot; dating from 1749, where it was given the Italian name &quot;corno inglese&quot;. Gluck and Haydn followed suit in the 1750s, and the first English horn concertos were written in the 1770s. The Schwarzenberg Wind Harmonie of 1771 employed 2 cors anglais as well as 2 oboes, 2 bassoons and 2 horns. Johan Went was first cor anglais and Ignaz Teimer (father of the Teimer brothers) was second cor anglais. The first oboe trios were composed by Johan Went for the Teimer brothers. The oboe and cor anglais writing in these original Bohemian/Viennese trios by Johan Went and Joseph Triebensee are notable as written by oboists for oboists and include some early examples of florid virtuosic writing for the cor anglais, paving the way for similar writing to come. In 1796 Johann and Franz Teimer died. The first recorded performance of an oboe trio was 1793 (which Beethoven attended). While the Teimer brothers performed in Vienna and environs, over 20 oboe trios were composed. Phillip Teimer continued to play the cor anglais in Schikaneder&#x27;s opera house in Vienna. He also sang some roles with the company due to his sonorous bass voice. Many cor anglais parts were specially written for him by Stengel, Süssmayr, Paer, Winter, Weigl, Eberl, Eybler, Salieri, Hummel, Schacht and Fisher.

Considering the name &quot;cor anglais&quot;, it is ironic that the instrument was not regularly used in France before about 1800 or in England before the 1830s. It is mentioned in the &quot;Penny Cyclopedia&quot; from 1838 as &quot;The English Horn, or Corno Inglese, is a deeper-toned oboe [...]&quot;, while the first identified printed use of the term &quot;cor anglais&quot; in English was in 1870. In the UK the instrument is colloquially generally referred to as the &quot;cor&quot;. The local equivalent for &quot;English horn&quot; is used in most other European languages, while a few languages use their equivalent of &quot;alto oboe&quot;.

Due to the earlier bowed or angular forms it took, the suggestion has been made that &quot;anglais&quot; might be a corruption of Middle French &quot;anglé&quot; (angular, or bent at an angle, &quot;angulaire&quot; in modern French), but this has been rejected on grounds that there is no evidence of the term &quot;cor anglé&quot; before it was offered as a possible origin of &quot;anglais&quot; in the late 19th century.

==Politics==
Navajo County leans towards the Republican Party. The county has not voted Democratic on a presidential level since 1996. Although its Native American population makes up nearly half of the county, a demographic that politically favors those of the Democratic Party, the county has a strong Latter-Day Saint presence (particularly in population centers such as Snowflake) that normally allows Republican candidates to carry the county. The city of Show Low and surrounding areas, as well as Holbrook, also contribute to Republican votes in the county. Notably, the county has become more Republican in recent cycles such as in 2022 and in 2024. In 2024, the city of Winslow, which has long been a Democratic stronghold, saw a heavy Republican shift, as did the area of Pinetop-Lakeside. The Navajo Nation also saw some major Republican trends, mirroring those in neighboring Apache County. On the other hand, the city of Holbrook saw a Democratic trend since 2020.

There is a tribal elementary school called Little Singer Community School, affiliated with the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE). Hataalii Yazhi, a medicine man, in the 1970s proposed establishing the school so area children did not have to travel far for their education. The school was named after him. The original buildings used two geodesic domes as features. In 2014 the school had 81 students. By 2014 the original campus was described by the Associated Press as being in poor repair. In 2004 the school first asked the BIE to get funding for a new building. The current campus had a cost of $28 million and an area of . It uses intersecting circles as an architectural feature.

<doc id="87953" wikidata="Q307076" url="?curid=87953" title="Abkhaz alphabet">
<text>The Abkhaz alphabet is a Cyrillic alphabet used for the Abkhaz language.

Abkhaz did not become a written language until the 19th century. Up until then, Abkhazians, especially princes, had been using Greek (up to c. 9th century), Georgian (9–19th centuries), and partially Turkish (18th century) languages. The Abkhaz word for alphabet is анбан (anban), which was borrowed from Georgian ანბანი (anbani).

==History==
The first Abkhaz alphabet was created in 1862 by Peter von Uslar. It had 55 letters and was based on the Cyrillic script. Another version, having 51 letters, was used in 1892 by Dimitry Gulia and K. Machavariani. In 1909, the alphabet was again expanded to 55 letters by Andria Tchotchua to adjust to the extensive consonantal inventory of Abkhaz.

In 1926, during the &quot;korenizatsiya&quot; policy in the Soviet Union, the Cyrillic alphabet was replaced by a Latin alphabet devised by Nikolay Marr. It featured 76 letters and was called the &quot;Abkhaz analytical alphabet&quot;. In 1928, this was replaced by another Latin alphabet. (See illustration at right.) From 1938 to 1954 the Abkhaz language was written in Georgian &quot;Mkhedruli script&quot;.

Since 1954, the Abkhaz language has been written in a new 58-letter (now 64-letter) Cyrillic alphabet (see chart below). Of these, 38 are graphically distinct; the rest are digraphs with and which indicate palatalization and labialization, respectively. In 1996, the most recent reform of the alphabet was implemented: while labialization had hitherto been marked with two additional letters, ә and у (у was used in the digraphs гу, ҕу, ку, қу, ҟу, and ху, which were not considered separate letters), since then only ә was retained in this function. Unusually, the Cyrillic plosive letters К П Т represent ejective consonants; the non-ejectives (pulmonic consonants) are derived from these by means of a descender at the bottom of the letter. In the case of the affricates, however, the plain letters are pulmonic, and the derived letters ejective.

The modern Abkhaz orthography gives preference to the letters Г К П Т Х Ч with descender (Ӷ Қ Ԥ Ҭ Ҳ Ҷ). The letters (Ҕ Ҧ) had previously (before 1996) had a hook, which Ҕ still does in Yakut. In pre-Soviet alphabets the hook was also used in Ӄ Ꚋ, see above.

The letters ь and ә are used as parts of digraphs, but are listed separately in the alphabet. Besides the digraphs listed in the alphabet, the letter ь occurs in ль , which is used in some loanwords.

==Government, policing, and politics==
Pima County is governed by a five-member Board of Supervisors who set ordinances and run services for the areas that do not fall within any city or town&#x27;s jurisdiction.

In Arizona, counties are creatures of the state, and do not have charters of their own. The county Board of Supervisors acts under powers delegated by state law, mainly related to minor ordinances and revenue collection. With few exceptions, these powers are narrowly construed. The state legislature devotes considerable time to local matters, with legislative approval required for many of the most basic local issues.

===Board of Supervisors and elected positions===
The Pima County Board of Supervisors is responsible for steering public policy in the region. The five-member board provides direction to the County Administrator, Jan Lesher, and the county&#x27;s various departments as they work to ensure safe communities, nurture economic development, sustainably manage natural resources and protect public health. In addition to overseeing the delivery of a host of municipal services, from roads to parks and libraries and law enforcement, board members also are responsible for approving the county budget. Elected to four-year terms, board members also set the amount of taxes to be levied.


Along with the Board of Supervisors the Arizona State Constitution allows for 7 other county elected officials.

===Pima County sheriff===
The Pima County Sheriff&#x27;s Department provides court protection, administers the county jail, provides coroner service, and patrols the unincorporated parts of Pima County. It is the seventh largest sheriff&#x27;s department in the nation. Incorporated towns within the county with municipal police departments are Tucson, Marana, Oro Valley, and Sahuarita.

===Politics===
Being home to a major population center and a major research university, Pima County is one of the most reliably Democratic counties in Arizona. After voting Democratic through 1930s and 1940s, it swung Republican following major population increase after World War II, becoming a Republican-leaning county. However, in 1964, it rejected Arizona&#x27;s native son Barry Goldwater by seven points, who won statewide by one point. However, despite the county&#x27;s Republican lean, Democrats would not win 40% of the vote only twice - in 1972, when George McGovern lost in a 49-state landslide and due to a balloting error in the county, the Socialist Workers Party came a distant third with 18% of the vote; and in 1980, when Jimmy Carter, being largely insensitive to Western states&#x27; issues, also lost many votes to independent John B. Anderson. Following Bill Clinton&#x27;s plurality victory by 12 points in 1992, all Democrats since 1996 have won the county by a majority and no Republican has come closer than six points in recapturing the county. In both 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump became the first Republican since Bob Dole in 1996 to fail to win 40% of the county&#x27;s vote. However, Trump won 41.7% of the county&#x27;s vote in his third presidential run in 2024.

<text>Pinal County is a county in the central part of the U.S. state of Arizona. According to the 2020 census, the population of the county was 425,264, making it Arizona&#x27;s third-most populous county. The county seat is Florence. The county was established in 1875.

Pinal County contains parts of the Tohono Oʼodham Nation, the Gila River Indian Community and the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation, as well as all of the Ak-Chin Indian Community.

Pinal County is included in the Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona Metropolitan Statistical Area. Suburban growth southward from greater Phoenix has begun to spread into the county&#x27;s northern parts; similarly, growth northward from Tucson is spreading into the county&#x27;s southern portions. Pinal County has five cities: Maricopa, Casa Grande, Apache Junction, Eloy, and Coolidge. There are also many unincorporated areas, which have shown accelerated growth patterns in recent years; such suburban development is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

==History==
Pinal County was carved out of neighboring Maricopa County and Pima County on February 1, 1875, during the Eighth Legislature. In the August 18, 1899, issue of &quot;The Arizona Magazine,&quot; the name &quot;Pinal&quot; is said to come from the pine-clad Pinal Mountains. Pinal County was the second-fastest-growing county in the U.S. between 2000 and 2010.

In 2010, CNN Money named Pinal County as the second fastest growing county in the USA.

Pinal County has been identified as the second riskiest county for combined impacts of climate change from 2040 to 2060, largely due to high risks of extreme heat, fire hazard and economic and crop damages.

==Politics==
During the 20th century, Pinal was very much a bellwether county in U.S. presidential elections, having supported the winning candidate in every election between Arizona&#x27;s statehood in 1912 and 2004 except for that of 1968, when Hubert Humphrey won the county by 3.2 percentage points but lost to Richard M. Nixon. As a result of the urban sprawl from Phoenix spreading into the county, a major political reversal has taken place between it and neighboring Maricopa County since the turn of the millennium. Maricopa County is now becoming more progressive as is the trend of most largely populated city centers in America. Pinal voters currently still trend more conservative for now. Donald Trump carried the county by the second-largest margin for a Republican since statehood.










==Government==
Salaries for county elected officials are set by the Arizona Revised Statutes. All county elected officials except the Sheriff (Ross Teeple as of 2025) and the County Attorney make a salary of $63,800, along with county benefits and compulsory participation in the Arizona State Elected Official Retirement Plan.
In 2020, the Republican Party won complete control of the Board of Supervisors. In 2022, the Arizona Supreme Court deemed their Road Improvement Tax (passed in 2018) as illegal due to the tax only applied to purchases under $10,000. In 2022, the county&#x27;s elections department came under intense scrutiny following several mistakes in the primary election. At the time, the Elections Department had only two full-time employees. The Board of Supervisors found themselves being accused of not properly funding the Elections Department.

==Economy==

<text>Santa Cruz is a county in southern Arizona, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population is 47,669. The county seat is Nogales. The county was established in 1899. It borders Pima County to the north and west, Cochise County to the east, and the Mexican state of Sonora to the south.

Santa Cruz County includes the Nogales, Arizona Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Tucson-Nogales, Arizona Combined Statistical Area.

==History==

Santa Cruz County, formed on March 15, 1899, out of what was then Pima County, is named after the Santa Cruz River. The river originates in the Canelo Hills in the eastern portion of the county, crosses south into Mexico near the community of Santa Cruz, Sonora, and then bends northwards returning into the United States (and Santa Cruz County) east of Nogales.

Father Eusebio Kino, an Italian explorer and missionary in the service of the Spanish Empire, named the Santa Cruz River–&quot;holy cross&quot; in Spanish–in the 1690s. In addition, Kino founded several missions to evangelize the different O&#x27;odham peoples living along the banks of the Santa Cruz River, including Missions San Cayetano del Tumacácori (1691) and San Gabriel de Guevavi (1691), as well as Los Reyes de Sonoita (1692) near Sonoita Creek. Along the river, but outside the boundaries of Santa Cruz County, Kino also founded Mission San Xavier del Bac (1692) near Tucson, Arizona, and Mission Santa Maria del Pilar (1693) in what is now Santa Cruz, Mexico. Kino&#x27;s San Cayetano and San Gabriel missions were destroyed in the O&#x27;odham peoples&#x27; 1751 Pima Revolt and rebuilt as Missions Los Santos Ángeles de Guevavi (1751), San José de Tumacácori (1753), and San Cayetano de Calabazas (1756). The ruins of all three of these later missions are now protected by Tumacácori National Historical Park. Disease, warfare, overwork, and changes in land ownership during Spanish colonization led to the demographic decline of the O&#x27;odham peoples of Santa Cruz County.

==Politics==










Owing to its border location and Hispanic majority population, Santa Cruz is a strongly Democratic county. The last Republican to win the county was George H. W. Bush in 1988, and although the Republicans won the county in six consecutive elections from 1968 to 1988, three of these wins were by very narrow margins. Following the trends seen in majority Hispanic counties across the United States, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump with 67.1% of the popular vote in the county, a slightly lower margin than Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 71.1% vote share in 2016. Trump&#x27;s gains were far higher than Biden&#x27;s losses (at nearly 8%), due to a combination of third parties losing votes and higher turnout. Despite this rightward shift in the vote share, Santa Cruz County remained as the most Democratic-leaning county in Arizona until 2024, when Apache and Coconino counties voted slightly more Democratic than Santa Cruz County, as Trump had the best performance for a Republican in the county since their last win in 1988, cracking 40% in the county for the first time since then.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==Notable People==
Elizabeth Gutfahr, former elected county treasurer who confessed to embezzling more than $38 million between 2012 and 2024.

==Economy==
Because it is the state&#x27;s smallest county, Santa Cruz County&#x27;s economic activity is also smaller. Its agriculture consists primarily of forage/hay, and the cattle products raised on that pasture and hay are almost 100% of farm products annually.

==Politics==
Historically Douglas was the most Republican county in Nevada, a state that tended to lean Democratic between the 1890s and 1950s. The last Democrat to carry the county was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 during his 48-state landslide over Alf Landon, and even then, he carried Douglas by 15 percent less than his statewide margin. It was the only Nevada county won by Charles Evans Hughes in 1916, and one of only two to vote for Progressive “Bull Moose” ex-President Theodore Roosevelt in 1912. It was also one of only two Nevada counties that voted for incumbent President Benjamin Harrison over insurgent Populist James B. Weaver in 1892 when the latter carried the state by over 40 percentage points. Even when the county did vote Democratic in 1896 and 1900, it was by much smaller margins than the rest of silver-mining Nevada.

The county remains a Republican stronghold, although it now is not quite as heavily Republican as some other rural counties in the state. Apart from FDR&#x27;s two victories, only two Democrats since 1920 — Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Barack Obama in 2008 — have won even 40 percent of the county&#x27;s vote. Despite the county&#x27;s strong Republican bent, residents tend to be somewhat moderate on social issues, with a small majority of county residents voting to legalize gay marriage in 2020.

<text>Yuma County is a county in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Arizona, on of 15 counties in the state. As of the 2020 census, its population was 203,881. The county seat is Yuma.

Yuma County includes the Yuma, Arizona Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The county borders three states: Sonora, Mexico, to the south, and two other states to the west, across the Colorado River: California of the United States and the Mexican state of Baja California.

Being 63.8% Hispanic in 2020, Yuma is Arizona&#x27;s largest majority-Hispanic county.

==History==
Long settled by Native Americans of indigenous cultures for thousands of years, this area was controlled by the Spanish Empire in the colonial era. In the 19th century, it was part of independent Mexico before the Mexican–American War and Gadsden Purchase.

Yuma County was one of four original Arizona counties created by the 1st Arizona Territorial Legislature. The county territory was defined as being west of longitude 113° 20&#x27; and south of the Bill Williams River. Its original boundaries remained the same until 1982, when La Paz County was created from its northern half.

The original county seat was the city of La Paz; in 1871 it was moved to Arizona City, later renamed as Yuma in 1873.

==Economy==
This county is the highest crop producer in the state by dollar value per year. Yuma County tops the list for the categories of vegetables + melons + potatoes + sweet potatoes at $782,293,000, and fruits + tree nuts + berries at $62,499,000. Overall this is the second (to Maricopa) producing county for all agricultural products at $1,143,068,000 per year and for organic production. Almost all of the dates (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;) in the state are grown here, about worth $35 million per year. This is the second highest citrus producer behind Maricopa, a distant second in grapefruit, limes, and oranges but producing far more lemons. Some olives, clingstone peaches, and plums are grown here. Yuma County produces almost all of the vegetable seed grown in the state. The average farmer age is the lowest in the state, at 56.6 years.

During the winter agricultural season from November to March, some 40,000 Mexican workers cross the border daily to work in United States fields. The area is watered by the Colorado River, and the sector supplies a large part of the US leafy vegetables. The Yuma Lettuce Days festival and agritourism is connected to Yuma agriculture. In 2017 the county produced vegetables worth $782,293,000, ranking first in the state and third in the entire country, from . Fruits brought $62,499,000, also first in the state, 56th out of &gt;3000 counties in the country. Jojoba (&quot;Simmondsia chinensis&quot;) is a valuable native crop here. From here it has also been introduced into cultivation in other countries.

The Sweetpotato Whitefly (Silverleaf Whitefly, &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot;) is a common pest here. The county is planted with large extents of several crops which serve as hosts.

Date trees (&quot;Phoenix dactylifera&quot;) were planted here in the 2010s. In this county, plantations suffer from the Carob Moth (&quot;Ectomyelois ceratoniae&quot;) and the Banks Grass Mite (&quot;Oligonychus pratensis&quot;).

Leaders in the county are aware their economy is tied to that of Mexican states on the other side of the border; both have to be considered. &quot;There are automotive plants in Ciudad Juárez, across from El Paso; aerospace plants in Mexicali, southwest of Yuma; and medical devices’ manufacturers in Tijuana, near San Diego. On the American side, there is a mix of retail stores, warehouses and trucking companies...&quot;

Because of Yuma County&#x27;s location along the U.S.-Mexico border, large numbers of aliens entering the United States illegally pass through Yuma County. From October 2004 to July 2005, some 124,400 undocumented foreign nationals were apprehended in the area, a 46% increase over the previous year. In 2014, however, only 5,902 people were apprehended. The report from the Congressional Research Service stated, &quot;...it is unclear how much of the drop-off is due to increased enforcement and how much is a result of the U.S. economic downturn and other systemic factors&quot;. 

The anticipates many agricultural jobs in the county will soon transition to robotics.

==Government==
The Board of Supervisors is the governing body of the county and a number of special districts. The board has members from five districts. The Board adopts ordinances, establishes programs, levies taxes, appropriates funds, appoints certain officials, and zones property and regulates development in the unincorporated area. In addition, members of the Board represent the county on numerous intergovernmental agencies.

In Arizona&#x27;s first 52 years as a state, Yuma County was a primarily Democratic county, only voting for the Republican candidates four times in presidential elections prior to 1968. From 1968 onward, it has consistently voted for Republican presidential candidates. In 2016, county voters elected more Democrats to the Board than Republicans for the first time since 2004. However, their margins of victory have been reduced in recent years as the county has rapidly grown in population and become majority-Hispanic. Donald Trump only won the county by 560 votes over Hillary Clinton in the presidential election of 2016. However, Trump&#x27;s margin did improve to over 4,000 votes as he won the county again in 2020 over Joe Biden. 

In 2024, Trump won Yuma County by over 20 percentage points against Kamala Harris, the best performance by a Republican since Ronald Reagan in 1984.

<text>Ada &quot;Ace&quot; Vélez (born September 15, 1969) is a Puerto Rican female professional boxer from Dania Beach, Florida who lives in Miami. Vélez was brought into boxing by former women&#x27;s boxing world champion Bonnie Canino.

After a successful undefeated amateur career that included a national title, Vélez became the first native Puerto Rican to win a women&#x27;s world boxing championship on January 19, 2001, when she defeated Kathy Williams on a unanimous decision over 10 rounds to win the IBA bantamweight title. Ten months later, she moved up in weight and challenged undefeated Mary Elizabeth Ortega for the WIBA super bantamweight title, again winning a 10-round unanimous decision.

Vélez won her first 10 pro fights before suffering her first loss as a professional, in her first defense of the WIBA title. On June 21, 2002, Melissa Del Valle decisioned Vélez in Waco, Texas in the featured bout on an all-women&#x27;s card featuring world champions Anne Wolfe, Sumya Anani, Delia Gonzalez and Kelsey Jeffries.

On December 21, she bounced back to reclaim the IBA version of the world bantamweight title by decisioning Lakeysha Williams over 10 rounds.

Vélez has added the WIBA bantamweight title to her IBA belt on June 28, 2003, when she beat Gonzalez on a seventh-round disqualification.

Vélez traveled to Denmark to defend her WIBA bantamweight title against Anita Christensen. on January 17, 2004, Vélez lost a highly controversial 10 round split decision to Christensen.
Vélez had knocked down Christensen in the 9th round, and looked to be the obvious winner of their encounter. The Danish press strongly criticized this decision, saying on record that Vélez was robbed of her title.

She fought Melinda Cooper for the vacant IBF super-bantamweight title at the National Stadium in San José, Costa Rica, on 31 March 2011, winning by split decision with two of the ringside judges scoring the contest 96-94 in her favour while the third had it for her opponent by the same tally. A rematch on 20 November 2011 saw Vélez retain her title by majority decision. One judge scored the fight a 95-95 draw but was overruled by the other two who scored it in her favour 98-92 and 97-93 respectively.

She now teaches kids, teens, and adults boxing at Velez Boxing and Fitness in Oakland Park, Florida. She makes them do exercise machines, running, strength and conditioning, and boxing.

Vélez was inducted into the International Women&#x27;s Boxing Hall of Fame in 2017.

<doc id="87964" wikidata="Q834631" url="?curid=87964" title="List of counties in Connecticut">
<text>There are eight counties in the U.S. state of Connecticut.

Four of the counties – Fairfield, Hartford, New Haven and New London – were created in 1666, shortly after the Connecticut Colony and the New Haven Colony combined. Windham and Litchfield counties were created later in the colonial era, while Middlesex and Tolland counties were created after American independence (both in 1785). Six of the counties are named for locations in England, where many early Connecticut settlers originated; Fairfield County was named after the salt marshes that bordered the coast, while New Haven County was named for the New Haven Colony.

Although Connecticut is divided into counties, there are no county-level governments, and local government in Connecticut exists solely at the municipal level. Almost all functions of county government were abolished in Connecticut in 1960, except for elected county sheriffs and their departments under them. Those offices and their departments were abolished by an act of the state legislature effective in December 2000. The functions the county sheriffs&#x27; departments played were assumed by the newly organized State Marshal Commission and the Connecticut Department of Corrections.

These counties are used in legacy geography, such as identifying land, national statistics, and personnel rostering and court jurisdictions in the state&#x27;s judicial and state marshal system. However, the three most populous—Fairfield, Hartford and New Haven—are as to many types of jurisdiction subdivided.

In 2019 the state recommended to the United States Census Bureau that the nine Councils of Governments replace its counties for statistical purposes. According to the Census Bureau, &quot;Connecticut&#x27;s COGs/Planning Regions have the authority to carry out administrative functions that are typically found among counties in other states.&quot; This proposal was approved by the Census Bureau in 2022, and will be fully implemented by 2024.

==U.S. Census Bureau==
The United States Census Bureau formally recognized the planning regions/councils of government as county equivalents in the Federal Register on June 6, 2022. A draft notice of potential recognition would have adapted the existing FIPS codes for the eight &quot;legacy counties&quot;, however in response to submitted comments, the bureau retired the codes and assigned new ones to more clearly illustrate the break in geographic continuity. The Census noted that there is substantial correlation between the historic county borders and planning regions, however planning regions may incorporate towns from several counties. The bureau notes that the recognition of planning regions as county equivalents was unique to the specific conditions in Connecticut, and would not constitute a binding precedent on similar conditions in other states.

==Alphabetical listing==




==Former counties==
Both were extraterritorial:
* Trumbull County, the Connecticut Western Reserve, ceded to Ohio in 1800
* Westmoreland County, Connecticut around Wilkes-Barre, ceded to Pennsylvania in 1784

<doc id="87965" wikidata="Q54231" url="?curid=87965" title="Fairfield County, Connecticut">
<text>Fairfield County is a county in the southwestern corner of the U.S. state of Connecticut. It is the most populous county in the state and was also its fastest-growing from 2010 to 2020. As of the 2020 census, the county&#x27;s population was 957,419, representing 26.6% of Connecticut&#x27;s overall population. The closest to the center of the New York metropolitan area, the county contains four of the state&#x27;s seven largest cities—Bridgeport (first), Stamford (second), Norwalk (sixth) and Danbury (seventh)—whose combined population of 433,368 is nearly half the county&#x27;s total population.

The United States Office of Management and Budget has designated Fairfield County as the Bridgeport–Stamford–Norwalk metropolitan statistical area. The United States Census Bureau ranked the metropolitan area as the 59th most populous metropolitan statistical area of the United States in 2019. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget has further designated the metropolitan statistical area as a component of the more extensive New York–Newark–Bridgeport, NY–NJ–CT–PA combined statistical area, the most populous combined statistical area and primary statistical area of the United States.

As is the case with all eight of Connecticut&#x27;s counties, there is no county government and no county seat. As an area, it is only a geographical point of reference. In Connecticut, the cities and towns are responsible for all local governmental activities including fire and rescue, schools, and snow removal; in a few cases, neighboring towns will share certain resources. The last county seat was Bridgeport, which had served this role from 1853 until 1960. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

Fairfield County&#x27;s Gold Coast helped rank it sixth in the U.S. in per-capita personal income by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in 2005, contributing substantially to Connecticut being one of the most affluent states in the U.S. Other communities are more densely populated and economically diverse than the affluent areas for which the county is better known.

==History==
Fairfield County was the home of many Native American tribes prior to the Europeans&#x27; arrival. People of the Schaghticoke tribe lived in the area of present-day New Fairfield and Sherman. From east to west the Wappinger sachemships included the Paugussetts, Tankiteke, and the Siwanoy. There were also Paquioque and Potatuck inhabitants of Fairfield County.

The Dutch explorer Adriaen Block explored coastal Connecticut in the Spring and early Summer of 1614 in the North America-built vessel &quot;Onrust&quot;. The first European settlers of the county, however, were Puritans and Congregationalists from England. Roger Ludlow (1590–1664), one of the founders of the Colony of Connecticut, helped to purchase and charter the towns of Fairfield (1639) and Norwalk (purchased 1640, chartered as a town in 1651). Ludlow is credited as having chosen the name Fairfield. Fairfield is a descriptive name referring to the beauty of its fields. The town of Stratford was settled in 1639 as well by Adam Blakeman (1596–1665). William Beardsley (1605–1661) was also one of the first settlers of Stratford in 1639.

Fairfield County was established by an act of the Connecticut General Court in Hartford along with Hartford County, New Haven County, and New London County; which were the first four Connecticut counties, on May 10, 1666. From transcriptions of the Connecticut Colonial Records for that day:
:This Court orders that from the east bounds of Stratford
:to ye bounds of Rye shalbe for future one County wch
:shalbe called the County of Fairfield. And it is ordered
:that the County Court shalbe held at Fairfield on the second
:Tuesday in March and the first Tuesday of November
:yearely. 

The original Fairfield County consisted of the towns of Rye, Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Fairfield, and Stratford. In 1673, the town of Woodbury was incorporated and added to Fairfield County. In 1683, New York and Connecticut reached a final agreement regarding their common border. This resulted in the cession of the town of Rye and all claims to the Oblong to New York. From the late 17th to early 18th centuries, several new towns were incorporated in western Connecticut and added to Fairfield County, namely Danbury (1687), Ridgefield (1709), Newtown (1711), and New Fairfield (1740). In 1751, Litchfield County was constituted, taking over the town of Woodbury. The final boundary adjustment to Fairfield County occurred in 1788 when the town of Brookfield was incorporated from parts of Newtown, Danbury, and New Milford, with Fairfield County gaining territory from Litchfield County.

Other early county inhabitants include:
*Joseph Hawley (born 1603 in England; died 1690), who had emigrated to America in 1629 and then settled in Stratford in 1650, later becoming Stratford&#x27;s first town clerk. Joseph Hawley&#x27;s son Ephraim built the Ephraim Hawley House in 1683 in Trumbull that is still standing and serves as a private residence.
*Thomas Fitch ( 1700–1774), from Norwalk, was a governor of the Colony of Connecticut.
*Gold Selleck Silliman (1732–1790) of the town of Fairfield fought for the Americans during the American Revolutionary War and rose to the rank of brigadier general by 1776. He fought in the New York campaign that year.
During the Revolutionary War, Connecticut&#x27;s prodigious agricultural output led to it being known informally as &quot;the Provisions State&quot;. In the spring of 1777, the British Commander-in-Chief, North America General William Howe, in New York City, ordered William Tryon to interrupt the flow of supplies from Connecticut that were reaching the Continental Army. Tryon and Henry Duncan led a fleet of 26 ships carrying 2,000 men to Westport&#x27;s Compo Beach to raid Continental Army supply depots in Danbury on April 22, 1777. American Major General David Wooster (1710–1777), who was born in Stratford, was in charge of the stores at Danbury and defended them with a force of only 700 troops. Two years later during a British raid on Greenwich on February 26, 1779 General Israel Putnam, who had stayed at Knapp&#x27;s Tavern the previous night, rode away on his horse to warn the people of Stamford. Putnam was shot at by the British raiders but was able to escape. The hat he was wearing with a musket ball hole in it is on display at Knapp&#x27;s Tavern in Greenwich (which is commonly, albeit somewhat erroneously, called Putnam&#x27;s cottage). In the summer of 1779, General William Tryon sought to punish Americans by attacking civilian targets in coastal Connecticut with a force of about 2,600 British troops. New Haven was raided on July 5, Fairfield was raided on the 7th and burned. Norwalk was raided on July 10 and burned on the 11th. Norwalk militia leader Captain Stephen Betts put up resistance to the invaders, but was overwhelmed by the powerful British raiders and was forced to retreat.
David Sherman Boardman (1786–1864) was a prominent early lawyer and judge in this and neighboring Litchfield County.

On October 7, 1801, Neheemiah Dodge and other members of the Danbury Baptist Association wrote a letter to then-president Thomas Jefferson expressing their concern that as Baptists they may not be able to express full religious liberty in the state of Connecticut whose &quot;ancient charter&quot; was adopted before the establishment of a Baptist church in the state. Jefferson replied in a letter to Dodge and the other members of the Danbury church on January 1, 1802, in which he stated that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution provided &quot;a wall of separation between church and State&quot; that protected them.

An agricultural region, the first railroad was the Housatonic Railroad, construction started 1836 and ended 1840, extending from Bridgeport to New Milford originally, connecting Litchfield County crops to the port in Bridgeport, by passing New York City. The New York and New Haven railroad along the county&#x27;s coast was constructed in the late 1840s, which started in New York City and ended in New Haven, connecting Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk and all the towns on the coast.

In 1851, the county seat of Fairfield County was moved from the town of Fairfield to the newly founded neighboring city of Bridgeport. This was due to its growing population and industry as the old courthouse erected 1794 was no longer adequate. The first hospital in the county, and the 3rd hospital in Connecticut behind Hartford and New Haven Hospitals, Bridgeport Hospital was founded in 1884 along with Fairfield County&#x27;s first nursing school. It would be soon followed by Danbury Hospital (1885), Norwalk Hospital (1893), Stamford Hospital (1896) Greenwich Hospital (1903),St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Bridgeport (1903), and Park City Hospital in Bridgeport (1926), which closed in 1993.

By 1900, the largest cities in the county were Bridgeport, Norwalk, Danbury, Stamford and Greenwich. By 1905, Bridgeport had become the principle manufacturing center in the state, and one of the major manufacturers in the New England region behind Boston, Providence, and Worcester, with $44,586,519 total worth of products manufactured without adjusting to today&#x27;s money. Stamford and Greenwich had become popular resort towns for New York City&#x27;s wealthy.

Connecticut in 1905 was 11th in the United States terms of industrial goods produced, and Fairfield County contained the city with the most total worth of products made, Bridgeport. One-fifth of Connecticut&#x27;s population was employed in manufacturing, the state&#x27;s largest industry which generated most of its wealth. Bridgeport in 1905 produced 20% of America&#x27;s corsets. The 2nd largest city in Connecticut behind New Haven by 1910, Bridgeport&#x27;s population grew by 50,000 people during the first 20 months of US involvement during the First World War, producing 50% of Allied ammunition during that time. Bridgeport by 1920 had a population of 143,555 people, then the 44th largest US city. Danbury, in northern Fairfield County, was known as the &quot;Hat City&quot;, producing 20% of America&#x27;s hats, until the industry began to decline in the 1920s. Stamford (population 40,067 in 1920), was known as the &quot;Lock City&quot;, as the home of the Yale and Towne Lock Manufacturing Company. Bridgeport, nicknamed &quot;Park City&quot; had in 1930 over 500 factories within its borders. Bridgeport Machines, Inc., a milling machine manufacturer, was founded in Bridgeport in 1938, as well as Hubbell Incorporated in the 1890s, these are two examples, various companies were headquartered in Bridgeport, such as Warnerco, ACME Shear, Westinghouse subsidiary Bryant Electric among others, and others such as Remington Arms, General Electric, Singer Sewing Machines, Sikorsky Aircraft, Carpenter Steel, and countless others, had large scale manufacturing complexes there.

Most of the county remained agricultural. Westport in the 1920s was a bohemian summer artist colony, and was home to famous artists, writers, and painters, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, who spent a summer in town. The Cos Cob art colony flourished from the late 1800s to the 1920s.

At the height of its influence in the 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had a distinct presence in the county and county politics. The group was most active in Darien, but had small chapters in Norwalk, Stamford, and Bridgeport. The Klan has since disappeared from the county.

The county&#x27;s first institution of higher learning was Western Connecticut State University, founded in Danbury in 1903 (known by its acronym, WCSU), followed by the University of Bridgeport in 1927, Fairfield University in neighboring Fairfield in 1947 and Sacred Heart University.

Nearly one-third of Fairfield County&#x27;s population lived within Bridgeport&#x27;s city limits in 1950, 31.5%. The city began to decline in population as families moved into nearby suburbs, such as Fairfield, leading to widespread residential development. Bridgeport slowly began to loose jobs and large corporations moved into southern states or outside the country. The city gained a reputation for having an aging industrial image, what New York Times articles described as a smokestack filled, aging view of the city from the highway. The Connecticut Turnpike (Interstate 95) was built in the mid-1950s along the coast, joining the scenic Merrit Parkway, built in the late 1930s to alleviate traffic on the Post Road, and built further inland away from population centers. Towns such as Westport, Darien, New Caanan, Stamford, and Greenwich became New York City suburbs, forming the Connecticut Gold Coast,
Fairfield County, along with all other Connecticut counties, was abolished as a governmental agency in accord with state legislation that took effect October 1, 1960. The first enclosed shopping malls in Fairfield County were Trumbull Shopping Park (1963), in the bedroom community of Trumbull just outside Bridgeport, the now gone Lafayette Shopping Park (1965) in Bridgeport, replaced downtown blocks that were demolished as part of the city&#x27;s urban renewal, Danbury Fair Mall (1968) on the former fairgrounds of the annual Danbury Fair, Hawley Lane Mallin Trumbull (1971) and the Stamford Town Center (1982) as part of the urban renewal project in downtown Stamford.

Stamford, Connecticut, is an example of edge cityurbanization. Stamford in the 1960s was a residential suburb of New York City, with a few industries and research laboratories, but of Stamford&#x27;s downtown was razed and rebuilt it with modern skyscrapers, and several major corporations moved their headquarters to Stamford, creating one of the largest corporate concentrations in the United States. Originally a more moderate plan, entire downtown blocks and streets were demolished in slow phases and replaced with office towers, residential towers and the Stamford Town Center shopping mall courtesy of the F.D. Rich Company, which was hired by the city to redevelop what was described as the aging, deteriorating downtown, throughout the 60s, 70s and early 80s. Stamford&#x27;s population grew from 92,713 in 1960 to 135,470
people in 2020, making it the 2nd largest city in Connecticut in 2022 (behind Bridgeport), surpassing New Haven.

==Geography==
===Land===

According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (25.3%) is water.

The terrain of the county trends from flat near the coast to hilly and higher near its northern extremity. The highest elevation is above sea level along the New York state line south of Branch Hill in the Town of Sherman; the lowest point is sea level itself.

The Taconic Mountains and the Berkshire Mountains ranges of the Appalachian Mountains run through Fairfield County. The Taconics begin roughly in Ridgefield and the Berkshires begin roughly in Northern Trumbull, both running north to Litchfield County and beyond. A portion of the Taconics also is in rural Greenwich and rural North Stamford in Fairfield County and run north into Westchester County, New York, eventually re-entering Fairfield County in Ridgefield. A small portion of the Appalachian Trail runs through Fairfield County; the trail enters Connecticut in the northernmost and least populous town in the county, Sherman, and moves east into Litchfield County, which encompasses the majority of the Appalachian Trail in Connecticut.

The section of the Taconic Mountains range that runs through Greenwich and North Stamford of Fairfield County is also the part of the Appalachians that is closest to the coast out of the entire Appalachian Mountains.

===Water===
The agreed 1684 territorial limits of the county are defined as east of New York&#x27;s Hudson River, which extends into Long Island Sound with a southerly limit of halfway to Long Island, New York. The eastern limit is mostly a natural border defined as the halfway point of the Housatonic River with New Haven County with the exception of several islands belonging wholly to Stratford. The depth of the Sound varies between 60 and .

The county hosts or contains the rivers Byram, Housatonic, Mianus, Mill, Norwalk, Pequonnock, Rippowam, Saugatuck, and Still.

====Pollution====
The Still River is polluted with mercury nitrate from the hat industry in Danbury, also thereafter diluting into the Housatonic River and Long Island Sound.

The Housatonic is residually polluted with Monsanto chemicals called Aroclor, polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. From until 1977, the river received PCB pollution discharges from the General Electric plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

===Demographic breakdown by town===

====Income====

Data is from the 2010 United States Census and the 2006–2010 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.
====Race====
Data is from the 2007–2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, ACS Demographic and Housing Estimates, &quot;Race alone or in combination with one or more other races.&quot;
==Economy==

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, corporations began moving their headquarters to Fairfield County from Manhattan; Thomas J. Lueck of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the trend &quot;permanently decentralized big business in the New York region.&quot; During the 1980s many buyouts and reorganizations and an economic recession lead to companies vacating much of the suburban office space in Fairfield County. In 1992 Fairfield County had the headquarters of over 25 major multinational corporations, giving it the third largest concentration of those companies in the United States after New York City and Chicago.

Fairfield County is home to a large concentration of hedge funds and private equity firms, with many located along the Gold Coast in places like Greenwich, Stamford, and Westport. Major hedge funds headquartered in Fairfield County include Bridgewater Associates, AQR Capital, Point72 Asset Management, Lone Pine Capital, Viking Global Investors, and Tudor Investment Corporation.

Fairfield County is the top location for aquaculture in the state.

==Government and municipal services==
As of 1960, counties in Connecticut do not have any associated county government structure. Thus Fairfield County is only a geographical point of reference. All municipal services are provided by the towns, who sometimes will share certain resources through regionalization. In order to address issues concerning more than one town, several regional agencies that help coordinate the towns for infrastructure, land use, and economic development concerns have been established. Within the geographical area of Fairfield County, the regional agencies are:

* Greater Bridgeport
* South Western
* The Valley (partly in New Haven County)
* Housatonic Valley (partly in Litchfield County)

===County municipal buildings===
Several former county municipal buildings are used by other state or local agencies, including:

* The Fairfield County Jail in Bridgeport on the corner of North Avenue and Madison Avenue, still actively used to house prisoners.
* The Fairfield County Court Houses in Bridgeport and Danbury which served the county&#x27;s judicial needs and housed county deputy sheriff&#x27;s until December 2000. The court houses are still marked &quot;Fairfield County Court House&quot;.

===Law enforcement===

Law enforcement within the geographic area of the county is provided by the respective town police departments, whereas in other states in the region such as New York and Vermont law enforcement would be provided by the local county sheriff&#x27;s department. In the less dense areas, such as Sherman, law enforcement is primarily provided by the Connecticut State Police. Prior to 2000, a County Sheriff&#x27;s Department existed for the purpose of executing judicial warrants, prisoner transport, court security, Bailiff, and county and state executions. These responsibilities have now been taken over by the Connecticut State Marshal System.

Some municipalities in the county still maintain a sheriff&#x27;s department to fill the void of the abolishment of the county sheriff&#x27;s department, such as the City of Shelton which has established the Shelton Sheriff&#x27;s Department to carry out warrants in the city.

===Judicial===
The geographic area of the county is served by the three separate judicial districts: Danbury, Stamford-Norwalk, and Fairfield. Each judicial district has a superior court located, respectively, in Danbury, Stamford, and Bridgeport. Each judicial district has one or more geographical area courts (&quot;GA&quot;&#x27;s), subdivisions of the judicial districts that handle lesser cases such as criminal misdemeanors, small claims, traffic violations, and other civil actions.

===Fire protection===
Fire protection in the county is provided by the towns. Several towns also have fire districts that provide services to a section of the town.

===Education===

Education in the county is usually provided by the town governments. The exceptions are the towns of Redding and Easton at the secondary level, as those two joined to form a regional secondary school district (Region 9).

School districts include:

K-12:

* Bethel School District
* Bridgeport School District
* Brookfield School District
* Danbury School District

===Crime rate===
Fairfield County has a low crime index of 2050.2 (per 100,000 citizens) as well as a murder closure rate of over 70%. Several Governmental agencies, as well as private security contractors, have made note of Fairfield&#x27;s low crime rates and the county currently has 6 cities and towns with a percentile safety index of 90% or higher compared to the rest of the continental United States (based on violent and property crimes).

===Politics===
As with neighboring Westchester County, Fairfield County was generally a Republican stronghold for much of the 20th century. Urban municipalities such as Stamford, Norwalk and Bridgeport trended Democratic, while the suburban and rural enclaves tended to lean Republican. However, during the 1990s, these latter areas began to increasingly shift towards Democratic candidates. Today, only Hartford County has a higher concentration of Democratic voters. The last time the county voted for a Republican presidential candidate was in 1992 for George H.W. Bush.


















==Hospitals==
*Bridgeport Hospital
*Danbury Hospital
*Greenwich Hospital
*Norwalk Hospital
*St. Vincent&#x27;s Medical Center (Bridgeport) in Bridgeport
*Stamford Hospital

==Transportation==

===Mass transit===
With Interstate 95 and the Merritt Parkway increasingly clogged with traffic, state officials are looking toward mass transit to ease the county&#x27;s major thoroughfares&#x27; traffic burden.

New office buildings are being concentrated near railroad stations in Stamford, Bridgeport and other municipalities in the county to allow for more rail commuting. Proximity to Stamford&#x27;s Metro-North train station was cited by the Royal Bank of Scotland as a key reason for locating its new U.S. headquarters building in downtown Stamford; construction on the office tower started in late 2006.

====Air====
Within Fairfield County there are two regional airports: Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Airport in Stratford and the Danbury Municipal Airport in Danbury.
The county is also served by larger airports such as Bradley International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, Tweed New Haven Regional Airport, and Westchester County Airport.

====Bus service====
Connecticut Transit&#x27;s Stamford division runs local and inter-city buses to the southern part of the county.
The Norwalk Transit District serves the Norwalk area in the southern central portion of the county; the Greater Bridgeport Transit Authority serves Bridgeport and eastern Fairfield County; and the Housatonic Area Regional Transit agency serves Danbury and the northern portions of the county.

====Ferry service====
The Bridgeport &amp; Port Jefferson Ferry carries passengers and cars from Bridgeport to Port Jefferson, New York, across Long Island Sound.

Ferry lines in and out of Stamford are also in development.

====Rail====
Commuter Rail is perhaps Fairfield County&#x27;s most important transportation artery, as it allows its residents an efficient ride to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. Service is provided on Metro-North&#x27;s New Haven Line, and every town on the shoreline has at least one station. Connecting lines bring service to New Canaan from Stamford on the New Canaan Branch, and to Danbury from South Norwalk on the Danbury Branch. Many trains run express from New York to Stamford, making it an easy 45-minute ride.

In the 2005 and 2006 sessions of the Legislature, massive appropriations were made to buy replacements for the 343 rail cars for the Metro-North New Haven Line and branch lines. The approximately 30-year-old cars will be replaced with new cars at a rate of ten per month starting in 2010.

Bridgeport and Stamford are also served by Amtrak, and both cities see a significant number of boardings on the Northeast Regional route (Boston to Newport News, VA). This route also serves other Amtrak stations in Connecticut, including New Haven, Old Saybrook, New London, and Mystic.

===Major roads===

====Boston Post Road====
U.S. 1 is the oldest east–west route in the county, running through all of its shoreline cities and towns. Known by various names along its length, most commonly &quot;Boston Post Road&quot; or simply &quot;Post Road&quot;, it gradually gains latitude from west to east. Thus, U.S. 1 west is officially designated &quot;South&quot; and east is &quot;North&quot;.

Though contiguous, U.S. 1 changes name by locality. In Greenwich it is Putnam Avenue. In Stamford, it becomes Main Street or Tresser Boulevard. In Darien, it is Boston Post Road or &quot;the Post Road&quot;. In Norwalk, it is Connecticut Avenue in the west, Van Zant St, Cross St, and North Av in the center, and Westport Avenue in the east. In Westport, it is Post Road West from the Norwalk town line until the Saugatuck River, where it becomes Post Road East until Fairfield. In Fairfield, it is again Boston Post Road or &quot;the Post Road&quot;. In Bridgeport, it follows Kings Highway in the west, North Avenue in the center, and Boston Avenue in the east. Finally, it becomes Barnum Avenue in Stratford.

====Interstate 95====
The western portions of Interstate 95 in Connecticut are known as the Connecticut Turnpike or the Governor John Davis Lodge Turnpike in Fairfield County and it crosses the state approximately parallel to U.S. Route 1. The road is most commonly referred to as &quot;I-95&quot;. The highway is six lanes (sometimes eight lanes) throughout the county. It was completed in 1958 and is often clogged with traffic particularly during morning and evening rush hours.

With the high cost of land along the Gold Coast, state lawmakers do not consider widening the highway to be fiscally feasible, although occasional stretches between entrances and nearby exits are now sometimes connected with a fourth &quot;operational improvement&quot; lane (for instance, westbound between the Exit 10 interchange in Darien and Exit 8 in Stamford).

====Merritt Parkway====
The Merritt Parkway, also known as &quot;The Merritt&quot; or Connecticut Route 15, is a truck-free scenic parkway that runs through the county parallel and generally several miles north of Interstate 95. It begins at the New York state line, where it is the Hutchinson River Parkway, and terminates on the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge, where it becomes the Wilbur Cross Parkway at the New Haven county line.

The interchange between the Merritt Parkway and Route 7 in Norwalk was completed around the year 2000. The project was held up in a lawsuit won by preservationists concerned about the historic Merritt Parkway bridges. It is now exit 39 off the Merritt, and exit 15 off I-95. The parkway is a National Scenic Byway and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

====Interstate 84====
Interstate 84, which runs through Danbury, is scheduled to be widened to a six-lane highway at all points between Danbury and Waterbury. State officials say they hope the widening will not only benefit drivers regularly on the route but also entice some cars from the more crowded Interstate 95, which runs roughly parallel to it. Heavier trucks are unlikely to use Interstate 84 more often, however, because the route is much hillier than I-95 according to a state Department of Transportation official.

====U.S. Route 7====
With its southern terminus at Interstate 95 in central Norwalk, U.S. Route 7 heads north through Wilton, Ridgefield, Danbury, and Brookfield to points north of the county. The route follows a path that was part of the pre-Columbian Great Trail. In the 1950s, officials planned to convert all of the route to a four to six lane expressway. The expressway was constructed in the cities of Danbury and Norwalk, but faced significantly opposition that prevented it from being constructed through the towns in between the two. Plans to construct the expressway, known as &quot;Super 7&quot;, have been floated throughout the decades, but have faced vocal opposition, and it has never been constructed. In lieu of the expressway, segments of Route 7 in Fairfield County have been widened over the years. Additionally, the expressway in Danbury has expanded north through Brookfield over the decades.

====Connecticut Route 8====
Route 8 terminates in downtown Bridgeport from I-95 with Connecticut Route 25 and goes north. It splits from Connecticut Route 25 at the Bridgeport—Trumbull town line and continues north into southeastern Trumbull and Shelton, then beyond the county through some of towns of the Naugatuck River Valley to Waterbury and beyond. Construction of the route provided some impetus for the creation of office parks in Shelton and home construction there and in other parts of The Valley.

====Connecticut Route 25====
Route 25 starts in downtown Bridgeport from I 95 with Route 8 and goes north. It splits from Connecticut Route 8 at the Bridgeport—Trumbull town line and continues into Trumbull. The limited access divided expressway ends in northern Trumbull, but Route 25 continues into Monroe, Newtown, and Brookfield.

==Sports==

Teams that previously called Fairfield County their home include the Connecticut Wildcats of USA Rugby League, the Danbury Whalers and the Danbury Titans of the Federal Hockey League, and the Bridgeport Bluefish in baseball&#x27;s independent Atlantic League. In addition, being a part of metropolitan New York City, the major professional sports teams of New York State and New Jersey are local teams to Connecticut.

<text>The Age of Spiritual Machines: When Computers Exceed Human Intelligence is a non-fiction book by inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil about artificial intelligence and the future course of humanity. First published in hardcover on January 1, 1999, by Viking, it has received attention from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. In the book Kurzweil outlines his vision for how technology will progress during the 21st century.

Kurzweil believes evolution provides evidence that humans will one day create machines more intelligent than they are. He presents his law of accelerating returns to explain why &quot;key events&quot; happen more frequently as time marches on. It also explains why the computational capacity of computers is increasing exponentially. Kurzweil writes that this increase is one ingredient in the creation of artificial intelligence; the others are automatic knowledge acquisition and algorithms like recursion, neural networks, and genetic algorithms.

Kurzweil predicts machines with human-level intelligence will be available from affordable computing devices within a couple of decades, revolutionizing most aspects of life. He says nanotechnology will augment our bodies and cure cancer even as humans connect to computers via direct neural interfaces or live full-time in virtual reality. Kurzweil predicts the machines &quot;will appear to have their own free will&quot; and even &quot;spiritual experiences&quot;. He says humans will essentially live forever as humanity and its machinery become one and the same. He predicts that intelligence will expand outward from Earth until it grows powerful enough to influence the fate of the universe.

Reviewers appreciated Kurzweil&#x27;s track record with predictions, his ability to extrapolate technology trends, and his clear explanations. However, there was disagreement on whether computers will one day be conscious. Philosophers John Searle and Colin McGinn insist that computation alone cannot possibly create a conscious machine. Searle deploys a variant of his well-known Chinese room argument, this time tailored to computers playing chess, a topic Kurzweil covers. Searle writes that computers can only manipulate symbols which are meaningless to them, an assertion which if true subverts much of the vision of the book.

==Background==

Ray Kurzweil is an inventor and serial entrepreneur. When &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; was published he had already started four companies: Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. which created optical character recognition and image scanning technology to assist the blind, Kurzweil Music Systems, which developed music synthesizers with high quality emulation of real instruments, Kurzweil Applied Intelligence, which created speech recognition technology, and Kurzweil Educational Systems, which made print-to-speech reading technology. Critics say predictions from his previous book &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; &quot;have largely come true&quot; and &quot;anticipated with uncanny accuracy most of the key computer developments&quot; of the 1990s. After this book was published he went on to expand upon its ideas in a follow-on book &quot;The Singularity is Near&quot;. Today Ray Kurzweil works at Google where he is attempting to &quot;create a truly useful AI [artificial intelligence] that will make all of us smarter&quot;.

===Law of accelerating returns===
Kurzweil opens by explaining that the frequency of universe-wide events has been slowing down since the Big Bang while evolution has been reaching important milestones at an ever-increasing pace. This is not a paradox, he writes, entropy (disorder) is increasing overall, but local pockets of increasing order are flourishing. Kurzweil explains how biological evolution leads to technology which leads to computation which leads to Moore&#x27;s law.

Kurzweil unveils several laws of his own related to this progression, leading up to his law of accelerating returns which says time speeds up as order increases. He believes Moore&#x27;s law will end &quot;by the year 2020&quot; but that the law of accelerating returns mandates progress will continue to accelerate, therefore some replacement technology will be discovered or perfected to carry on the exponential growth.

As in &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; Kurzweil argues here that evolution has an intelligence quotient just slightly greater than zero. He says it is not higher than that because evolution operates so slowly, and intelligence is a function of time. Kurzweil explains that humans are far more intelligent than evolution, based on what we have created in the last few thousand years, and that in turn our creations will soon be more intelligent than us. The law of accelerating returns predicts this will happen within decades, Kurzweil reveals.

===Philosophy of mind===

Kurzweil introduces several thought experiments related to brain implants and brain scanning; he concludes we are not a collection of atoms, instead we are a pattern which can manifest itself in different mediums at different times. He tackles the mystery of how self-awareness and consciousness can arise from mere matter, but without resolution. Based partly on his Unitarian religious education Kurzweil feels &quot;all of these views are correct when viewed together, but insufficient when viewed one at a time&quot; while at the same time admitting this is &quot;contradictory and makes little sense&quot;.

Kurzweil defines the spiritual experience as &quot;a feeling of transcending one&#x27;s everyday physical and mortal bounds to sense a deeper reality&quot;. He elaborates that &quot;just being—experiencing, being conscious—is spiritual, and reflects the essence of spirituality&quot;. In the future, Kurzweil believes, computers will &quot;claim to be conscious, and thus to be spiritual&quot; and concludes &quot;twenty-first-century machines&quot; will go to church, meditate, and pray to connect with this spirituality.

Kurzweil says Alan Turing&#x27;s 1950 paper &quot;Computing Machinery and Intelligence&quot; launched the field of artificial intelligence. He admits that early progress in the field led to wild predictions of future successes which did not materialize. Kurzweil feels intelligence is the &quot;ability to use optimally limited resources&quot; to achieve goals. He contrasts recursive solutions with neural nets, he likes both but specifically mentions how valuable neural nets are since they destroy information during processing, which if done selectively is essential to making sense of real-world data. A neuron either fires or not &quot;reducing the babble of its inputs to a single bit&quot;. He also greatly admires genetic algorithms which mimic biological evolution to great effect.

Recursion, neural nets and genetic algorithms are all components of intelligent machines, Kurzweil explains. Beyond algorithms Kurzweil says the machines will also need knowledge. The emergent techniques, neural nets and genetic algorithms, require significant training effort above and beyond creating the initial machinery. While hand-coded knowledge is tedious and brittle acquiring knowledge through language is extremely complex.

===Building new brains===

To build an artificial brain requires formulas, knowledge and sufficient computational power, explains Kurzweil. He says &quot;by around the year 2020&quot; a $1,000 personal computer will have enough speed and memory to match the human brain, based on the law of accelerating returns and his own estimates of the computational speed and memory capacity of the brain. Kurzweil predicts Moore&#x27;s law will last until 2020 so current integrated circuits should come close to human brain levels of computation, but he says three dimensional chips will be the next big technology, followed potentially by optical computing, DNA computing, nanotubes, or quantum computing.

Kurzweil feels the best model for an artificial brain is a real human brain, and suggests slicing up and digitizing preserved human brains or examining them non-invasively as technology permits. Kurzweil differentiates between scanning the brain to understand it, in a generic fashion, and scanning a particular person&#x27;s brain in order to preserve it in exact detail, for &quot;uploading&quot; into a computer for example. The latter is much harder to do, he notes, because it requires capturing much more detail, but it will eventually happen as well. When it does &quot;we will be software, not hardware&quot; and our mortality will become a function of our ability to &quot;make frequent backups&quot;.

===Building new bodies===

Kurzweil notes that many thoughts people have are related to their bodies, and reassures that he does not believe in creating a disembodied brain. He reviews all the various body implants that existed when the book was published, explaining that our bodies are already becoming more synthetic over time. Kurzweil says this trend will continue and that the technology will advance from macroscopic implants, to cellular sized insertions, and finally to nanotechnology.

Nanotechnology has the potential to reshape the entire world, Kurzweil exclaims. Assembling materials molecule by molecule could solve energy problems, cure cancer and other diseases, strengthen our bodies, and produce self-assembling food, clothing, and buildings. Kurzweil admits that nanotechnology carries a big risk; a self-replicating substance, without the constraints of a living organism, might grow out of control and consume everything. However he points out that today there are already technologies which pose grave risks, for example nuclear power or weapons, and we have managed to keep them relatively safe, so he feels we can probably do the same with nanotechnology.

Finally Kurzweil says there is the prospect of virtual bodies, where direct neural implants would give us the sensation of having bodies and a way to exert control, without any physical manifestation at all. Although he quickly brings things back to nanotechnology by pointing out that sufficiently advanced nanotechnology will be like having a virtual world, since &quot;utility fog&quot; will appear to be entirely absent and then instantly morph into functional physical shapes. Kurzweil broaches the topic of sex in futuristic times, reminding us that every new technology &quot;adopts sexual themes&quot;. Kurzweil envisions virtual sex, sexbots, and as well as more chaste activities like strolling along a &quot;virtual Cancún beach&quot;.

===State of the art===
Kurzweil explains that in 1999 computers are essential to most facets of life, yet he predicts no major disruption related to the then-pending Y2K problem. He says computers are narrow-minded and brittle so far, but suggests in specific domains they are showing signs of intelligence. As examples Kurzweil cites computer-generated or assisted music, and tools for the automatic or semi-automatic production of literature or poetry. He shows examples of paintings by AARON as programmed by Harold Cohen which can be automatically created. Kurzweil reviews some of his predictions from &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; and various past presentations, and is very pleased with his record. Finally he predicts a new Luddite movement as intelligent machines take away jobs, although he predicts a net gain of new and better jobs.

=== Predictions ===

Kurzweil has a dense chapter of predictions for each of these years: 2009, 2019, 2029, 2099. For example, when discussing the year 2009 he makes many separate predictions related to computer hardware, education, people with disabilities, communication, business and economics, politics and society, the arts, warfare, health and medicine, and philosophy.

As one example he predicts a 2009 computer will be a tablet or smaller sized device with a high quality but somewhat conventional display, while in 2019 computers are &quot;largely invisible&quot; and images are mostly projected directly into the retina, and by 2029 he predicts computers will communicate through direct neural pathways. Similarly in 2009 he says there is interest and speculation about the Turing test, by 2019 there are &quot;prevalent reports&quot; of computers passing the test, but not rigorously, while by 2029 machines &quot;routinely&quot; pass the test, although there is still controversy about how machine and human intelligence compare.

In 2009 he writes it will take a supercomputer to match the power of one human brain, in 2019 $4,000 will accomplish the same thing, while in 2029 $1,000 will buy the equivalent of 1000 humans brains. Dollar figures are in 1999 dollars. Kurzweil predicts life expectancy will rise to &quot;over one hundred&quot; by 2019, to 120 by 2029, and will be indefinitely long by 2099 as humans and computers will have merged.

===Molly===
The book features a series of sometimes humorous dialogs between an initially unnamed character, later revealed to be a young woman named Molly, and the author. For most of the book she serves as proxy for the reader, asking the author for clarification, challenging him, or otherwise eliciting additional commentary about the current chapter. For example:

&quot;So I&#x27;ll be able to download memories of experiences I&#x27;ve never had?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Yes, but someone has probably had the experience. So why not have the ability to share it?&lt;br&gt;
&quot;I suppose for some experiences, it might be safer to just download the memories.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Less time-consuming also.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Do you really think that scanning a frozen brain is feasible today?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Sure, just stick your head in my freezer here.
Later in the book during the prediction chapters Molly seems to inhabit whatever year the predictions are about, while Kurzweil remains in the present. So Kurzweil starts questioning her about how things are in future, and her lines serve as additional predictions or commentary. For example:
&quot;No, I&#x27;m talking about real reality now. For example, I can see that Jeremy is two blocks away, headed in this direction.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
An embedded chip?&lt;br&gt;
&quot;That&#x27;s a reasonable guess. But it&#x27;s not a chip exactly. It&#x27;s one of the first useful nanotechnology applications. You eat this stuff.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Stuff?&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Yeah, it&#x27;s a paste, tastes pretty good, actually. It has millions of little computers — we call them trackers — which work their way into your cells.&quot;
===The rest of the universe===

Kurzweil says life in the universe is &quot;both rare and plentiful&quot; meaning for vast stretches there is nothing then piled into a small space it is everywhere. He suggests any form of life that invents technology will, if it survives, relatively quickly reach the point of merging with that technology, the same thing he predicts will happen to humans. Therefore, Kurzweil explains if we ever met another civilization, we would really be meeting with its technology. The technology would likely be microscopic in size because that is all that would be necessary for exploration. The civilization would not be looking for anything except knowledge, therefore we would likely never notice it.

Kurzweil feels intelligence is the strongest force in the universe, because intelligence can cause sweeping physical changes like defending a planet from an asteroid. Kurzweil predicts that as the &quot;computational density&quot; of the universe increases, intelligence will rival even &quot;big celestial forces&quot;. There is disagreement about whether the universe will end in a big crunch or a long slow expansion, Kurzweil says the answer is still up in the air because intelligence will ultimately make the decision.

==Reception==

===Analysis===

Kurzweil uses Deep Blue, the IBM computer that beat the world chess champion in 1997, as an example of fledgling machine intelligence. John Searle, author and professor of philosophy at University of California, Berkeley, reviewing &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; in &quot;The New York Review of Books,&quot; disagrees with Kurzweil&#x27;s interpretation. Searle argues that while Kasparov was &quot;quite literally, playing chess&quot; the computer in contrast was doing &quot;nothing remotely like it;&quot; instead, it was merely manipulating &quot;a bunch of meaningless symbols&quot;.

Searle offers a variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of answering questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue&#x27;s victory to the manner in which a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness[5].

Searle continues by contrasting simulation of something with &quot;duplication or recreation&quot; of it. Searle points out a computer can simulate digestion, but it will not be able to digest actual pizza. In the same way, he says, computers can simulate the processes of a conscious brain, but that does not mean it is conscious. Searle has no objection to constructing an artificial consciousness producing brain &quot;using some chemistry different from neurons&quot; so long as it duplicates &quot;the actual causal powers of the brain&quot; which he says precludes computation by itself, since that only involves symbol manipulation. Searle concludes by saying the increased computational power that Kurzweil predicts &quot;moves us not one bit closer to creating a conscious machine&quot;, instead he says the first step to building conscious machines is to understand how the brain produces consciousness, something we are only in the infancy of doing.

Colin McGinn, an author and philosophy professor at the University of Miami, wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that machines might eventually exhibit external behavior at a human-level, but it would be impossible to know if they have an &quot;inner subjective experience&quot; as people do. If they do not, then &quot;uploading&quot; someone into a computer is equivalent to letting their mind &quot;evaporate into thin air,&quot; he argues. McGinn is skeptical of the Turing test, claiming it smacks of the long-abandoned doctrine of behaviorism, and agreeing with the validity of Searle&#x27;s &quot;quite devastating&quot; Chinese room argument. He believes minds do compute, but that it does not follow that computation alone can create a mind, instead he says minds have phenomenological properties, perhaps originating from organic tissue. Therefore, he insists that neither silicon chips nor any future technology Kurzweil mentions will ever be conscious.

===Reviews===

McGinn says &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines&quot; is &quot;detailed, thoughtful, clearly explained and attractively written&quot; as well as having &quot;an engaging discussion of the future of virtual sex&quot; and that the book is for &quot;anyone who wonders where human technology is going next&quot;. However, Diane Proudfoot, philosophy professor at the University of Canterbury, wrote in &quot;Science&quot; that Kurzweil&#x27;s historical details are inaccurate and his philosophical understanding is flawed and that these transgressions inspired &quot;little confidence in his imaginings about the future&quot;.

Chet Raymo, physics professor at Stonehill College writes that &quot;Ray Kurzweil has a better record than most at foreseeing the digital future&quot; and &quot;Kurzweil paints a tantalizing — and sometimes terrifying — portrait of a world where the line between humans and machines has become thoroughly blurred&quot;. He says the book is a &quot;welcome challenge to beliefs we hold dear&quot; and feels we can only shape the future if we anticipate it first. Jim Bencivenga, staff writer for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, says Kurzweil &quot;possesses a highly refined and precise ability to think exponentially about technology over time&quot;. Bencivenga also says we should take Kurzweil&#x27;s predictions very seriously because of his &quot;proven track record&quot;. Lyle Feisel, former electrical engineering professor, writes the predictions from Kurzweil&#x27;s &quot;The Age of Intelligent Machines&quot; &quot;have largely come true&quot; and so &quot;engineers and computer scientists would do well to give [this book] a read&quot;.

==In other media==
The Canadian rock band Our Lady Peace based their 2000 concept album &quot;Spiritual Machines&quot; on &quot;The Age of Spiritual Machines.&quot; They recruited Kurzweil to voice several tracks, on which he read select passages from the book. On October 29, 2021, Our Lady Peace released a sequel album, &quot;Spiritual Machines 2&quot;, as an NFT that was made available on January 28, 2022, in traditional formats.

<text>Hartford County is a county located in the north central part of the U.S. state of Connecticut. According to the 2020 census, the population was 899,498, making it the second-most populous county in Connecticut. Hartford County contains the city of Hartford, the state capital of Connecticut and the county&#x27;s most populous city, with 121,054 residents at the 2020 census. Hartford County is included in the Hartford-East Hartford-Middletown metropolitan statistical area.

On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s county governments were disbanded in 1960, and the councils of governments took over some of the local governmental functions. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==History==
Hartford County was one of four original counties in Connecticut established on May 10, 1666, by an act of the Connecticut General Court. The act establishing the county states:
:This Court orders that the Townes on the River from yee
:north bounds of Windsor wth Farmington to ye south end of
:ye bounds of Thirty Miles Island shalbe &amp; remaine to be one
:County wch shalbe called the County of Hartford. And it
:is ordered that the County Court shalbe kept at Hartford on
:the 1st Thursday in March and on the first Thursday in September yearely.

As established in 1666, Hartford County consisted of the towns of Windsor, Wethersfield, Hartford, Farmington, and Middletown. The &quot;Thirty Miles Island&quot; referred to in the constituting Act was incorporated as the town of Haddam in 1668. In 1670, the town of Simsbury was established, extending Hartford County to the Massachusetts border. In the late 17th to early 18th centuries, several more towns were established and added to Hartford County: Waterbury in 1686 (transferred to New Haven County in 1728), Windham in 1694 (transferred to Windham County in 1726), Hebron in 1708 (transferred to Tolland County in 1785), Coventry in 1712 (transferred to Windham County in 1726), and Litchfield in 1722 (transferred to Litchfield County in 1751).

In 1714, all of the unincorporated territory north of the towns of Coventry and Windham in northeastern Connecticut to the Massachusetts border were placed under the jurisdiction of Hartford County. Windham County was constituted in 1726, resulting in Hartford County losing the towns of Windham, Coventry, Mansfield (incorporated in 1702), and Ashford (incorporated in 1714). Northwestern Connecticut, which was originally placed under the jurisdiction of New Haven County in 1722, was transferred to Hartford County by 1738. All of northwestern Connecticut was later constituted as the new Litchfield County in 1751. In 1785, two more counties were established in what was now the U.S. state of Connecticut: Tolland and Middlesex. This mostly resulted in the modern extent of Hartford County. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the establishment of several more towns resulted in minor adjustments in the bounds of the county. The final adjustment resulting in the modern limits occurred on May 8, 1806, when the town of Canton was established.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau in 2010, the county had a total area of , of which is land and (2.1%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Connecticut by land area.

The county is divided into two unequal parts by the Connecticut River, and watered by Farmington, Mill, Podunk, Scantic, and other rivers. The surface is very diverse: part of the river valleys are alluvial and subject to flooding, while other portions of the county are hilly and even mountainous.

==Communities==

In Connecticut, there is no county-level executive or legislative government; the counties determine probate, civil and criminal court boundaries, but little else. Each city or town is responsible for local services such as schools, snow removal, sewers, fire department and police departments. In Connecticut, cities and towns may agree to jointly provide services or establish a regional school system.

<text>Litchfield County is a county in northwestern Connecticut, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 185,186. The county was named after Lichfield, in England. Litchfield County has the lowest population density of any county in Connecticut and is the state&#x27;s largest county by area.

Litchfield County comprises the Torrington, CT, Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT–PA, Combined Statistical Area.

As is the case with the other seven Connecticut counties, there is no county government and no county seat. Each town is responsible for all local services such as schools, snow removal, sewers, and fire and police departments. However, in some cases in rural areas, adjoining towns may agree to jointly provide services or even establish a regional school system. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s county governments were disbanded in 1960, and the councils of governments took over some of the local governmental functions. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==History==
Litchfield County was created on October 9, 1751, by an act of the Connecticut General Court from land belonging to Fairfield, New Haven, and Hartford counties. The act establishing the county states:

That the townships of Litchfield, Woodbury, New Milford, Harwinton, New Hartford, Barkhempstead, Hartland, Colebrook, Norfolk, Canaan, Salisbury, Kent, Sharon, Cornwall, Goshen, Torrington, and Winchester, lying in the northwesterly part of this Colony, shall be and remain one entire county, and be called the County of Litchfield, and shall have and exercise the same powers, and authorities, and be subject to the same regulations, as the other counties in this Colony by law have and are subject unto. The bounds of which county shall extend north to the Colony line, and west to the
Colony line till it meets with the township of New Fairfield, and to include the towns abovementioned.


Between 1780 and 1807, several new towns were created at the boundaries between Litchfield County and other counties in Connecticut. The town of Watertown was established in 1780 from Waterbury and was placed under Litchfield County jurisdiction. The establishment of the town of Brookfield from part of New Milford in 1788 resulted in Litchfield County losing territory to Fairfield County. In 1796, the town of Hartland was transferred to Hartford County. In 1798, the town of Oxford was established from part of Southbury causing Litchfield County to lose territory to New Haven County. In 1807, the town of Southbury was transferred to New Haven County. The final boundary change occurred on October 8, 1807, when the town of Middlebury was established from part of Woodbury.

In 1862, during the Civil War, Litchfield County raised the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of Volunteers Heavy Artillery. This regiment, originally the 19th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, served in the defense of Washington, D.C. from September 1862 to March 1864, at which time it was transferred to the Army of the Potomac. On June 1, 1864, the 2nd Connecticut Heavy Artillery fought as infantry (as it continued to do through the war) in the Battle of Cold Harbor, experiencing the heaviest proportionate losses of any Connecticut regiment in the Civil War. The regiment remained active to the end of the war, and its final mustering out September 5, 1865.

==Geography==

Litchfield County is roughly contiguous with the portion of the Appalachian Mountains range known as the Berkshire Mountains (sometimes locally, this area is called the Litchfield Hills).

<text>Middlesex County is a county in the south central part of the U.S. state of Connecticut. As of the 2020 census, the population was 164,245. The county was created in May 1785 from portions of Hartford County and New London County.

Middlesex County is included in the Hartford-East Hartford-Middletown metropolitan statistical area known as Greater Hartford.

As with all eight of Connecticut&#x27;s counties, there is now no county government and no county seat. In Connecticut, towns are responsible for all local government activities, including local police, fire and rescue, snow removal, and schools. In a few cases, neighboring towns will share certain resources, e.g. water, gas, etc. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s county governments were disbanded in 1960, and the councils of governments took over some of the local governmental functions. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==Government==
Middletown was the county seat of Middlesex County from its creation in 1785 until the elimination of county government in 1960. There is no government in Middlesex County other than the Middlesex County Judicial District. All county functions other than courts and county sheriff&#x27;s departments were discontinued in 1960, and again in 2000 when the county sheriff&#x27;s departments were reorganized as the Connecticut Judicial Marshal, due to political corruption in the county sheriff&#x27;s departments. Joseph E. Bibisi was the last person to serve as high sheriff of Middlesex County.

==Geography==
The county has a total area of , of which is land and (15.9%) is water. It is the smallest county in Connecticut by land area and second-smallest by total area.

The terrain trends from mostly level along the Connecticut River and Atlantic coast to gently rolling uplands away from them. The highest elevation is close to a triangulation station in Meshomasic State Forest, at above sea level; the lowest point is sea level.

Middlesex County is also the home of Wadsworth Falls.

<text>New Haven County is a county in the south central part of the U.S. state of Connecticut. As of the 2020 census, the population was 864,835, making it the third-most populous county in Connecticut. Two of the state&#x27;s five largest cities, New Haven (3rd) and Waterbury (5th), are part of New Haven County.

New Haven County is part of the New Haven-Milford, CT Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is included in the New York metropolitan Combined Statistical Area.

County governments were abolished in Connecticut in 1960. Thus, as is the case with all eight of Connecticut&#x27;s counties, there is no county government, and no county seat. Until 1960, the city of New Haven was the county seat. In Connecticut, towns are responsible for all local government activities, including fire and rescue, snow removal and schools. In some cases, neighboring towns will share certain activities, e.g. schools, health, etc. New Haven County is merely a group of towns on a map, and has no specific government authority. The county Sheriff system was abolished by voters and replaced by State Judicial Marshals in 2000. As a result, the state judicial system in New Haven County has three judicial districts: New Haven, Ansonia-Milford, and Waterbury. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==History==
Following the process of unification of New Haven Colony with Connecticut Colony in 1664–65, cohesion could be improved. New Haven County was constituted by an act of the Connecticut General Court on May 10, 1666, along with Hartford County, Fairfield County, and New London County. The act establishing the county states:
:This Court orders that from the east bounds of Guilford
:vnto ye west bounds of Milford shalbe for future one County
:wch shalbe called the County of N: Hauen. And it is
:ordered that the County Court shalbe held at N: Hauen on
:the second Wednesday in March and on the second Wednesday
:in Nouember yearely.

As established in 1666, New Haven County consisted of the towns of Milford, New Haven, and Guilford. The town of Wallingford was established in 1670 in unincorporated area north of New Haven and formally added to New Haven County in 1671. In 1675, the town of Derby was established north of Milford. In 1686, the town of Waterbury was established, but was assigned as part of Hartford County. Waterbury was transferred to New Haven County in 1728. In 1722, most of northwestern Connecticut (except for the town of Litchfield) was placed under the jurisdiction of New Haven County. Eight years later, in 1730, the eastern half of northwestern Connecticut was transferred to the jurisdiction of Hartford County. By mid-1738, with the exception of the towns of New Milford, Sharon, and Salisbury, the entire territory of northwestern Connecticut was under Hartford County. In 1751, Litchfield County was constituted consisting of all the towns in northwestern Connecticut. Between 1780 and 1807, several more towns were established along the northern boundary of New Haven County, resulting in the alteration of the limits of the county. The final boundary alteration leading to the modern boundary resulted from the establishment of the town of Middlebury on October 8, 1807.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (29.9%) is water. It is the second-largest county in Connecticut by total area.

===Features===
The terrain is mostly flat near the coast, with low hills defining the rest of the area, rising significantly only in the north of the county. The highest elevation is close to the northernmost point in the county, found at two areas of approximately above sea level in the town of Wolcott. The lowest point is sea level.

Notable geographic landmarks include Mount Carmel (&quot;Sleeping Giant&quot;), West Rock and East Rock.

===Adjacent counties===
*Hartford County (north)
*Middlesex County (east)
*Fairfield County (west)
*Litchfield County (northwest)

New Haven county is bounded on the south by Long Island Sound.

===National protected area===
*Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge (part)

==Government and municipal services==
As of 1960, counties in Connecticut do not have any associated county government structure. All municipal services are provided by the towns. In order to address issues concerning more than one town, several regional agencies that help coordinate the towns for infrastructure, land use, and economic development concerns have been established. Within the geographical area of New Haven County, the regional agencies are:
*South Central
*Central Naugatuck Valley (partly in Litchfield County)
*The Valley (partly in Fairfield County)

===Judicial===
The geographic area of the county is served by the three separate judicial districts: Ansonia-Milford, Waterbury, and New Haven. The Ansonia-Milford jurisdiction has two superior courthouses, one in Derby, the other in Milford. The Waterbury and New Haven judicial districts have superior courthouses located, respectively, in Waterbury, and New Haven.

===Law enforcement===
Law enforcement within the geographic area of the county is provided by the respective town police departments. Prior to 2000, a County Sheriff&#x27;s Department existed for the purpose of executing judicial warrants, prisoner transport, and court security. These responsibilities have now been taken over by the Connecticut State Marshal System.

===Fire protection===
Fire protection in the county is provided by the towns. Several towns also have fire districts that provide services to a section of the town.

Founded in 1937, New Haven County has a county-wide fire-protection agency called &quot;New Haven County Fire Emergency Plan&quot; based in Hamden to &quot;Coordinate Mutual Aid - Radio Problems, assist members of county at major incidents if requested, provide training&quot;.

===Water service===
Water service is provided by a regional non-profit public corporation known as the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority. The Regional Water Authority supplies water to most of the towns within New Haven County, excluding the Waterbury area and the towns of Guilford and Madison. The Regional Water Authority is one of only two such county-wide public water service providers in the state.

===Politics===
As with most other Connecticut counties, New Haven County is a Democratic stronghold. The last Republican victory in New Haven County was George H.W. Bush in 1988. From the 1990s through 2012, the county increasingly trended Democratic, though since then it has become more competitive. Though he did not carry the county, Republican Donald Trump received over 40% of its vote in all three of his campaigns (2016, 2020 and 2024), a feat that Republican candidates had achieved only once in the previous six elections.














==Transportation==
===Major Roads===
====Boston Post Road====
U.S. 1 is the oldest east–west route in the county, running through all of its shoreline cities and towns. Known by various names along its length, most commonly &quot;Boston Post Road&quot; or simply &quot;Post Road&quot;, it gradually gains latitude from west to east. Thus U.S. 1 west is officially designated &quot;South&quot; and east is &quot;North&quot;.

====Interstate 91====
The start of Interstate 91 begins at the interchange in New Haven with I-95. It runs parallel to U.S. Route 5 as it heads towards Hartford and Vermont.

====Interstate 95====
The western portions of Interstate 95 in Connecticut are known as the Connecticut Turnpike or the Governor John Davis Lodge Turnpike in New Haven County and it crosses the state approximately parallel to U.S. Route 1. The road is most commonly referred to as &quot;I-95&quot;. The highway is six lanes (sometimes eight lanes) throughout the county. It was completed in 1958 and is often clogged with traffic particularly during morning and evening rush hours.

With the cost of land so high along the Gold Coast, state lawmakers say they do not consider widening the highway to be fiscally feasible, although occasional stretches between entrances and nearby exits are now sometimes connected with a fourth &quot;operational improvement&quot; lane (for instance, westbound between the Exit 10 interchange in Darien and Exit 8 in Stamford). Expect similar added lanes in Darien and elsewhere in the Fairfield County portion of the highway in the future, lawmakers and state Department of Transportation officials say.

====Wilbur Cross Parkway====
The Wilbur Cross Parkway or Connecticut Route 15, is a truck-free scenic parkway that runs through the county parallel and generally several miles north of Interstate 95. It begins at the Igor I. Sikorsky Memorial Bridge and terminates at the Berlin turnpike. The parkway goes through Heroes Tunnel in New Haven.

The parkway is a National Scenic Byway and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

====Interstate 84====
Interstate 84, which runs through Danbury, is scheduled to be widened to a six-lane highway at all points between Danbury and Waterbury. State officials say they hope the widening will not only benefit drivers regularly on the route but also entice some cars from the more crowded Interstate 95, which is roughly parallel to it. Heavier trucks are unlikely to use Interstate 84 more often, however, because the route is much hillier than I-95 according to a state Department of Transportation official.

<text>New London County is a county in the southeastern corner of Connecticut and comprises the Norwich-New London, Connecticut Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Hartford-East Hartford, Connecticut Combined Statistical Area. There is no county government and no county seat, as is the case with all eight of Connecticut&#x27;s counties; towns are responsible for all local government activities, including fire and rescue, snow removal, and schools.

New London County contains reservations of four of the five state-recognized Indian tribes, although the Paugassett were historically located farther west. The population was 268,555 as of the 2020 census.

On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s county governments were disbanded in 1960, and the councils of governments took over some of the local governmental functions. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==History==
Southeastern New England was dominated by the Pequot people at the time of English colonization. They spoke the Mohegan-Pequot language and were one of the Algonquian-speaking tribes in the coastal areas. After years of conflict, the Colonists and their Indian allies defeated the Pequots in the Pequot War of 1637, ending their dominance. Two descendant Pequot tribes are recognized by the state today, as are three other tribes.

New London County was one of four original counties in Connecticut that were established on May 10, 1666, by an act of the Connecticut General Court, which states:
:This Court orders that from the Paukatuck River wth
:Norridge to ye west bounds of Homonoscet Plantation shalbe
:for future one County, wch County is called the County of
:N: London. And it is ordered that the County Court shalbe
:held at N. London the first Wednesday in June and the third

New London County in 1666 consisted of the towns of Stonington, Norwich, New London, and Saybrook. The &quot;Homonoscet Plantation&quot; was settled in March 1663, at first as Kenilworth, but was incorporated as the town of Killingworth in 1667. Several new towns were incorporated and added to New London over the next few decades: Preston in 1687, Colchester in 1699, and Lebanon in 1700. The settlements along the Quinebaug Valley were placed in New London County in 1697, and incorporated as Plainfield in 1699. By 1717, more towns were established in northeastern Connecticut and added to New London County between the Quinebaug Valley and the Rhode Island border.

Windham County was constituted from Hartford and New London counties on May 12, 1726, consisting of towns in northeastern Connecticut. New London County lost the towns of Voluntown, Pomfret, Killingly, Canterbury, Plainfield, and Lebanon to the newly formed county. In 1785, Middlesex County was constituted, consisting of towns along the lower Connecticut River Valley, taking away the towns of Killingworth and Saybrook from New London County. Several additional boundary adjustments took place in the 19th century: the establishment of the town of Marlborough in 1803, the transfer of the town of Lebanon from Windham County in 1824, and the transfer of the town of Voluntown from Windham County in 1881.

==Government and municipal services==
As of 1960, counties in Connecticut do not have any associated county government structure. All municipal services are provided by the towns. Regional councils of governments were established throughout the state in 1989 in order to address regional issues concerning infrastructure, land use, and economic development. Most of the towns of New London County are part of the Southeastern Connecticut Council of Governments, the exceptions being the towns of Lyme, Old Lyme, and Lebanon. Lyme and Old Lyme are part of the Connecticut River Estuary Regional Planning Agency, while Lebanon is part of the Windham Regional Council of Governments.

===Judicial===
The geographic area of the county is coterminous with the New London judicial district, with the superior courts located in the cities of New London and Norwich.

===Law enforcement===
Law enforcement within the geographic area of the county is provided by the respective town police departments. Prior to 2000, a County Sheriff&#x27;s Department existed for the purpose of executing judicial warrants, prisoner transport, and court security. These responsibilities have now been taken over by the Connecticut State Marshal System.

===Fire protection===
Fire protection in the county is provided by the towns. Several towns also have fire districts that provide services to a section of the town.

===Water service===
Water service to 12 of the 21 towns of New London County is provided by a regional non-profit public corporation known as the Southeastern Water Authority. The Southeastern Water Authority supplies water to participating towns within New London County and is one of only two such county-wide public water service providers in the state. Seven towns receive water service from one or more private corporations. The city of Norwich and most of the town of Groton provide for their own water service.

===Garbage disposal===
Several towns in New London County have organized the Southeastern Connecticut Regional Resources Recovery Authority. The participating towns are East Lyme, Griswold, Groton, Ledyard, Montville, New London, North Stonington, Norwich, Preston, Sprague, Stonington, and Waterford.

===Education===
Education in the county area is usually provided by the individual town governments. The less populated towns of Lyme and Old Lyme have joined to form a single, regional school district (Region 18).

School districts include:

In the last three presidential elections, Democratic strength was predominantly seen in the cities of New London and Norwich, as well as much of the county&#x27;s southern and coastal areas. Conversely, Republican strength in the same elections was seen in the northern areas of the county.

<text>Tolland County ( ) is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Connecticut. As of the 2020 census, its population was 149,788. It is incorporated into 13 towns and was originally formed on October 13, 1785, from portions of eastern Hartford County and western Windham County.

The county is included in the Hartford-East Hartford-Middletown, CT Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Counties in Connecticut have no governmental function; all legal power is vested in the state, city and town governments. The office of High Sheriff in Connecticut counties was officially abolished by ballot in 2000, and corrections and court services were transferred to the state marshals. Tolland County has the same boundaries as the Tolland Judicial District. On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s county governments were disbanded in 1960, and the councils of governments took over some of the local governmental functions. Connecticut&#x27;s eight historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==Politics==

For over a century, Tolland County behaved like a typical northern Yankee Republican county in presidential elections, only voting Democratic in 1932, 1936, 1964, and 1968. However, in recent elections, Tolland County has become a Democratic leaning county, following the trend of many other counties in greater New England. This started with Bill Clinton&#x27;s plurality in the 1992 election and Democrats have won the county in every presidential election since then. That being said, Tolland County has been much friendlier to Republicans in local elections, as Tolland County would still vote Republican in recent gubernatorial elections. In 2022, Governor Ned Lamont became the first Democrat to win Tolland County in a gubernatorial race since 1994.

<text>Windham County ( ) is one of the eight historical counties in the U.S. state of Connecticut, located in its northeastern corner. As of the 2020 census, the population was 116,418, making it the least populous county in Connecticut. It forms the core of the region known as the Quiet Corner. Windham County is included in the Worcester, MA-CT Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is also included in the Boston-Worcester-Providence, MA-RI-NH-CT Combined Statistical Area. The entire county is within the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor, as designated by the National Park Service.

==History==
The area that is now Windham County became of interest to the English around 1635, but went unsettled for over fifty years due to its lack of access to the shore. John Winthrop the Younger took a strong interest to this land, purchased land from the Narragansetts, and was given permission by the court of Connecticut to settle in October 1671. In 1678, a tract of land, called Joshua&#x27;s Tract (Joshua was the son of Mohegan chief Uncas), was willed to Connecticut officials, and in February 1682, it was gifted to Samuel and Daniel Mason. In 1684, 1200 acres of land was sold to Jonathan Curtis, Thomas Dudley and Samuel Mason, among others, by the Nipmunks.

Windham County was created from Hartford and New London counties on May 12, 1726, by an act of the Connecticut General Court. The act establishing the county states:
:That the west bounds of the town of Lebanon, the north
:bounds of Coventry, the north bounds of Mansfield till it
:meet with the southwest bounds of Ashford, the west bounds
:of Ashford, the east bounds of Stafford, the Massachusetts
:line on the north, and Rhode Island line on the east, the north
:bounds of Preston, and north bounds of Norwich, containing
:the towns of Windham, Lebanon, Plainfield, Canterbury,
:Mansfield, Coventry, Pomfret, Killingly, Ashford, Voluntown
:and Mortlake, shall be one entire county, and called by the
:name of County of Windham.

In May 1749, the town of Woodstock (formerly New Roxbury), Worcester County, Province of Massachusetts Bay, was unilaterally annexed by Connecticut Colony and assigned to Windham County. In 1785, the town of Union (incorporated in 1734) was transferred to the newly formed Tolland County. Over the next century, Windham County would lose several towns to Tolland and New London counties: Coventry to Tolland in 1786, Lebanon to New London in 1824, Columbia and Mansfield to Tolland in 1827, and Voluntown to New London in 1881. New towns were formed over the years using land from the original towns of the county: Thompson in 1785, Brooklyn and Hampton in 1786, Sterling in 1794, Chaplin in 1822, Eastford in 1847, Putnam in 1855, and Scotland in 1857. The final boundary adjustment occurred on April 7, 1885, when the boundary dispute between the towns of Windham and Mansfield was resolved.

On June 6, 2022, the U.S. Census Bureau formally recognized Connecticut&#x27;s nine councils of governments as county equivalents instead of the state&#x27;s eight counties. Connecticut&#x27;s county governments were disbanded in 1960, and the councils of governments took over some of the local governmental functions. Connecticut&#x27;s historical counties continue to exist in name only, and are no longer considered for statistical purposes.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (1.6%) is water.

The highest point in Windham County is Snow Hill in Ashford at 1,210 feet.

==Government==
County level government in the state of Connecticut was abolished in 1960. All government affairs and services are administered by either the state or local municipality.

The office of county high sheriff was abolished by constitutional referendum in 2000. All former functions of the county sheriff&#x27;s office are now carried out by the state marshals service. The last high sheriff (or official for that matter) of Windham County was Thomas W. White, who left office in 2000 due to the discontinuation of the county sheriff&#x27;s departments in Connecticut.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
Major highways through Windham County include Interstate 395, which runs north–south from the New London County line at Plainfield to the Massachusetts state line at Thompson. The southern part of I-395 is part of the Connecticut Turnpike, which branches off the interstate in Killingly and runs east–west from I-395 exit 35, to U.S. Route 6 at the Rhode Island state line.

Other north–south routes include Route 12, which parallels I-395 through many local communities, Route 169, a National Scenic Byway traveling through rural communities from the New London County line in Canterbury to the Massachusetts state line in Woodstock. Other secondary north–south roads are Routes 89, 198, 97, 21, and 49.

Major east–west routes are U.S. Route 44 from the Tolland County line at Ashford to the Rhode Island state line at Putnam, and U.S. Route 6 from the Tolland County line at Windham to the Rhode Island state line at Killingly. U.S. Route 6 has short expressway segments in Windham and Killingly. Other secondary east–west roads are Routes 14, 101, 171, and 197.

===Air===
Windham Airport is the primary airport for the county, located three miles from Willimantic. Other smaller airports include Woodstock Airport and Danielson Airport.

===Biking===
There are many bike paths in the county. The major two trails are the Air Line State Park Trail and the Hop River State Park Trail, both these trails enter the county through Windham. The Hop River Trail ends at the Air Line Trail shortly after entering the county, while the Air Line Trail continues all the way into Putnam. Another section of the Air Line Trail is in Thompson, which continues to the border with Massachusetts which it counties as the Southern New England Trunkline Trail. Another shorter trail is the Moosup Valley State Park Trail that starts in Plainfield and continues down into the state border with Rhode Island which it continues as Washington Secondary Rail Trail.

The primary law enforcement agency most Windham County towns is the Connecticut State Police, primarily Troop D based in Danielson which serves Brooklyn, Canterbury, Chaplin, Eastford, Hampton, Killingly, Pomfret, Putnam (outside the SSD), Scotland, Sterling, Thompson, Woodstock and I-395 between exit 28 and the MA border. Troop C, based in Tolland, covers the town of Ashford, and Troop K, based in Colchester, covers the town of Windham.

Only three municipalities in the county (the town of Plainfield, the Willimantic Special Services District, and the Putnam Special Services District), have their own local police departments that serve as the primary law enforcement in those areas. Eastern Connecticut State University located in Willimantic also has its own local police department (established under Connecticut General Statutes Sec. 10a-142) which serves as the primary law enforcement agency for the university campus even though they are located within the Willimantic Special Services District.

The Windham County Sheriff&#x27;s Department was disbanded in 2000 and their former duties are now carried out by the Connecticut State Marshals Service.

Most towns in the county have local Constables that carry out some municipal legal and security functions.

<text>Stand by Me is a 1986 American coming-of-age drama film directed by Rob Reiner. Based on Stephen King&#x27;s 1982 novella &quot;The Body&quot;, the film is set in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Oregon in 1959. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; stars Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix, Corey Feldman, and Jerry O&#x27;Connell as four boys who set out on a journey to find the dead body of a missing boy. The film&#x27;s title is derived from the 1961 song of the same name by Ben E. King, which plays during the film&#x27;s closing credits.

&quot;Stand by Me&quot; received positive reviews upon release and was a commercial success. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and for two Golden Globe Awards: One for Best Drama Motion Picture and one for Best Director. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; has called &quot;Stand by Me&quot; &quot;a staple of youthful nostalgia&quot; and &quot;the rare movie that necessarily gets better with time&quot;.

In 1985, writer Gordie Lachance reads a newspaper article about a fatal stabbing involving his childhood best friend, Chris Chambers. He recalls an incident from when he was 12 years old when he, Chris, and two other friends, Teddy Duchamp and Vern Tessio, went searching for the body of a missing boy named Ray Brower near the town of Castle Rock, Oregon, during Labor Day weekend in 1959. As a child, Gordie&#x27;s parents largely ignored him as they grieved the death of their elder son, Denny. Unlike their parents, Denny had paid attention to Gordie.

Vern overhears his big brother, Billy, talking with his friend, Charlie, about finding the body. Billy does not want to inform police because it could draw attention to a car theft he and Charlie committed. When Vern tells his friends about the body, the four boys—hoping to become local heroes—decide to look for it. After Chris steals his father&#x27;s pistol, he and Gordie run into local hoodlums &quot;Ace&quot; Merrill and Chris&#x27;s older brother, &quot;Eyeball.&quot; Ace threatens Chris with a lit cigarette and steals Gordie&#x27;s Yankees cap, which was a gift from Denny.

The boys begin their trip. After stopping at a junkyard for water, they are caught trespassing by owner Milo Pressman and his dog, Chopper. Once they escape over a fence, Milo calls Teddy&#x27;s mentally ill veteran father a &quot;loony&quot; and refers to how he almost burned Teddy&#x27;s ear off. An enraged Teddy tries to attack Milo but the other boys restrain him. The four continue their hike, and Chris encourages Gordie to fulfill his potential as a writer despite his father&#x27;s disapproval. While crossing a railroad bridge, Gordie and Vern narrowly avoid being killed by an approaching train by jumping off the tracks. In the evening, as the boys camp, Gordie tells a fictional story he created about &quot;David &#x27;Lard-Ass&#x27; Hogan&quot;, an obese boy who is constantly bullied. Seeking payback, he downs a bottle of castor oil before entering a pie-eating contest and throws up deliberately, inducing mass vomiting among everyone there.

That night, Chris complains to Gordie that he hates being associated with his family&#x27;s reputation. He admits to stealing school milk money but says he confessed to a teacher, yet was still suspended as the teacher kept quiet and pocketed the money. Devastated by the teacher&#x27;s betrayal, Chris breaks down and cries.

The next day, the boys wade across a swamp, discovering it filled with leeches. Gordie faints after finding one in his underwear. After more hiking, the boys locate the body. The discovery traumatizes Gordie, who asks Chris why Denny had to die and cries about his father hating him. Chris comforts Gordie and asserts that his father simply does not know him.

Ace and his gang arrive to claim the body and threaten to hurt the boys if they stay. When Chris refuses to back down, Ace draws a switchblade. Gordie gets the gun, fires a warning shot, and stands beside Chris while aiming it at Ace. Ace demands the weapon, but Gordie refuses while insulting and threatening him. Ace and his gang vow revenge and leave. The boys decide that exploiting Brower&#x27;s death would be wrong and instead report it via an anonymous phone call. They walk back to Castle Rock and part ways.

Back in the present day, Gordie is finishing a memoir of the experience. He notes that Vern and Teddy separated from him and Chris in junior high. Vern married after high school, had four children, and became a forklift operator. Teddy tried getting into the Army but his damaged ear and poor eyesight disqualified him. He ended up serving jail time and working odd jobs. Chris took college prep courses with Gordie and, despite struggling, later became a lawyer, with the two eventually drifting apart. Recently, while attempting to break up a fight in a restaurant, he was stabbed to death. Gordie writes that despite not having seen Chris in over a decade, he will miss him forever. He ends his narration with the following words: &quot;I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was twelve. Jesus, does anyone?&quot;

==Production==

===Development===

The film was adapted from the Stephen King novella &quot;The Body&quot;. Bruce A. Evans sent a copy of &quot;The Body&quot; to Karen Gideon, the wife of his friend and writing partner Raynold Gideon, on August 29, 1983, as a gift for her birthday. Both Gideon and Evans quickly became fans of the novella and shortly thereafter contacted King&#x27;s agent, Kirby McCauley, seeking to negotiate film rights; McCauley replied that King&#x27;s terms were $100,000 and 10% of the gross profits. Although the money was not an issue, the share of gross profits was considered excessive, especially considering that no stars could be featured to help sell the movie. In response, Evans and Gideon pursued an established director, Adrian Lyne, to help sell the project.

After reading the novella, Lyne teamed up with Evans and Gideon, but all the studios the trio approached turned the project down except for Martin Shafer at Embassy Pictures. Embassy spent four months negotiating the rights with McCauley, settling on $50,000 and a smaller share of the profits, and Evans and Gideon spent eight weeks writing the screenplay. Evans and Gideon asked to also produce the film, but Shafer suggested they team up with Andrew Scheinman, a more experienced producer. Embassy was unwilling to meet Lyne&#x27;s salary for directing the film until Evans and Gideon agreed to give up half of their share of profits to meet Lyne&#x27;s asking price.

Lyne was going to direct the film, but had promised himself a vacation following the production of &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;, and would not be available to start production until the spring of 1986. Reiner was better known at the time for playing Michael Stivic in &quot;All in the Family&quot; and had just started a directing career, making comedies such as &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; and &quot;The Sure Thing&quot;. He was sent the script by Scheinman, and his initial reaction was that the script had promise but &quot;no focus&quot;. After Lyne withdrew from the project, Reiner signed on to direct in September 1984. In a 2011 interview, Reiner discussed his realization that the film should focus on the character of Gordie:

&quot;In the book, it was about four boys, but...once I made Gordie the central focus of the piece then it made sense to me: this movie was all about a kid who didn&#x27;t feel good about himself and whose father didn&#x27;t love him. And through the experience of going to find the dead body and his friendship with these boys, he began to feel empowered and went on to become a very successful writer. He basically became Stephen King.&quot;

Reiner has said that he identified with Gordie, as he himself struggled with the shadow of fame cast by his comedian father, Carl Reiner. The writers incorporated Reiner&#x27;s suggestions, producing a new script by December 1984 for Embassy&#x27;s review and approval.

Days before the shooting started in the summer of 1985, Embassy was sold to Columbia Pictures, which made plans to cancel the production. Norman Lear, one of the co-owners of Embassy and the developer of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, gave of his own money to complete the film, citing his faith in Reiner and the script. However, since Embassy also would have distributed the film, once the film was completed it had no distributor. The producers showed a print to Michael Ovitz, head of the powerful Creative Artists Agency, and Ovitz promised to help them find a distributor. Paramount, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. all passed on the film; Columbia Pictures production head Guy McElwaine screened the film at his house because he was feeling ill, and the positive reaction of his daughters convinced him to distribute the film. In March 1986, Columbia Pictures, concerned that the original title, &quot;The Body&quot;, was misleading, renamed the film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. According to screenwriter Raynold Gideon, &quot;The Body&quot; &quot;sounded like either a sex film, a bodybuilding film, or another Stephen King horror film. Rob came up with &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, and it ended up being the least unpopular option.&quot; The film&#x27;s name is derived from Ben E. King&#x27;s 1961 song, &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, which plays during the ending credits.

===Casting===
In a 2011 interview with NPR, Wil Wheaton attributed the film&#x27;s success to the director&#x27;s casting choices:

Feldman recalled how his home life translated into his onscreen character: &quot;[Most kids aren&#x27;t] thinking they&#x27;re going to get hit by their parents because they&#x27;re not doing well enough in school, which will prevent them from getting a work permit, which will prevent them from being an actor.&quot; O&#x27;Connell agreed that he was cast based on how his personality fit the role, saying &quot;Rob wanted us to understand our characters. He interviewed our characters. [...] I tried to stay like Vern and say the stupid things Vern would. I think I was Vern that summer.&quot; Reiner and the producers interviewed more than 70 boys for the four main roles, out of more than 300 who auditioned; Phoenix originally read for the part of Gordie Lachance. Ethan Hawke auditioned for Chris Chambers.

Before filming began, Reiner put the four main actors together for two weeks to play games from Viola Spolin&#x27;s &quot;Improvisation for the Theater&quot; (which Reiner called &quot;the bible&quot; of theater games) and build camaraderie. As a result, a friendship developed among the actors. Wheaton would recall &quot;When you saw the four of us being comrades, that was real life, not acting.&quot;

Before settling on Richard Dreyfuss as the narrator (and the role of the adult Gordie), Reiner considered David Dukes, Ted Bessell, and Michael McKean.

===Filming===

Principal photography began on June 17, 1985, and ended on August 23, 1985.

Parts of the film were shot in Brownsville, Oregon, which stood in for the fictional town of Castle Rock. The town was selected for its small-town 1950s ambience. Approximately 100 local residents were employed as extras.

The &quot;barf-o-rama&quot; scene was also filmed in Brownsville. A local bakery supplied the pies and extra filling, which was mixed with large-curd cottage cheese to simulate the vomit. The quantity of simulated vomit varied per person, from as much as during the triggering event to as little as .

The scene where the boys outrace a steam train engine across an 80-foot tall trestle was filmed on the McCloud River Railroad, above Lake Britton Reservoir near McArthur-Burney Falls Memorial State Park in California. The scene took a full week to shoot, making use of four small adult female stunt doubles with closely cropped hair who were made up to look like the film&#x27;s protagonists. Plywood planks were laid across the ties to provide a safer surface on which the stunt doubles could run. The film crew even brought a brand-new camera for use in the shot, only for it to jam between the rails on the first shot. The locomotive used for the scene, M.C.R.R. 25, is still in daily operation for excursion service on the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad. Telephoto compression was used to make the train appear much closer than it actually was. The actors did not feel a sense of danger until Reiner threatened them by saying, &quot;You see those guys? They don&#x27;t want to push that dolly down the track anymore. And the reason they&#x27;re getting tired is because of you... I told them if they weren&#x27;t worried that the train was going to kill them, then they should worry that I was going to. And that&#x27;s when they ran.&quot;

==Music==
Jack Nitzsche composed the film&#x27;s musical score. On August 8, 1986, a soundtrack album was released containing many of the 1950s and early 1960s oldies songs featured in the film:
# &quot;Everyday&quot; (Buddy Holly) – 2:07
# &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot; (Shirley and Lee) – 2:22
# &quot;Come Go with Me&quot; (The Del-Vikings) – 2:40
# &quot;Whispering Bells&quot; (The Del-Vikings) – 2:25
# &quot;Get a Job&quot; (The Silhouettes) – 2:44
# &quot;Lollipop&quot; (The Chordettes) – 2:09
# &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; (The Coasters) – 1:52
# &quot;Great Balls of Fire&quot; (Jerry Lee Lewis) – 1:52
# &quot;Mr. Lee&quot; (The Bobbettes) – 2:14
# &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (Ben E. King) – 2:55

The movie&#x27;s success sparked a renewed interest in Ben E. King&#x27;s song &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. Initially a number four pop hit in 1961, the song re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in October 1986, eventually peaking at number nine in December of that year.

A DVD was issued on August 29, 2000, with a director&#x27;s commentary, multiple language options (subtitles and audio), scene selections with motion images, and a featurette titled &quot;Walking The Tracks: The Summer Of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. The film was re-issued on Blu-ray in 2011 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment, and again on 4K Blu-ray in 2019.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was a box office success in North America. It opened in a limited release in 16 theaters on August 8, 1986, and grossed $242,795, averaging $15,174 per theater. The film then had its wide opening in 745 theaters on August 22 and grossed $3,812,093, averaging $5,116 per theater and ranking number 2. The film&#x27;s widest release was 848 theaters, and it ended up earning $52,287,414 overall, well above its $8million budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 92% based on 64 reviews and a rating average of 8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Stand by Me&quot; is a wise, nostalgic movie with a weird streak that captures both Stephen King&#x27;s voice and the trials of growing up.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Reviewing the film for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Walter Goodman opined that Reiner&#x27;s direction was rather self-conscious, &quot;looking constantly at his audience&quot;. While the lead actors were &quot;individually likable&quot;, Goodman called the film a &quot;trite narrative&quot; and said that &quot;Reiner&#x27;s direction hammers in every obvious element in an obvious script.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Dave Kehr wrote that there was &quot;nothing natural in the way Reiner has overloaded his film with manufactured drama&quot;. In contrast, Sheila Benson called the film &quot;[a treasure] absolutely not to be missed&quot; in her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Paul Attanasio, reviewing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called the acting ensemble &quot;wonderful&quot; and particularly praised the performances by Wheaton and Phoenix.

Stephen King was very impressed with the film. On the special features of the 25th anniversary Blu-ray set, King indicated that he considered the film to be the first successful translation to film of any of his works. According to a later interview with Gene Siskel, Reiner recalled that after a private early screening of the film, King excused himself for fifteen minutes to compose himself; he later returned to remark, That&#x27;s the best film ever made out of anything I&#x27;ve written, which isn&#x27;t saying much. But you&#x27;ve really captured my story. It is autobiographical. In a 2016 interview, King said that &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was his favorite adaptation of his work, alongside &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;.

==Legacy==
In a 2011 piece entitled &quot;25 years of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;&quot;, writer Alex Hannaford opined that &quot;[for] anyone older than about 33, &quot;Stand by Me&quot; remains one of the greatest films to come out of the Eighties.&quot; Hannaford added that the film &quot;has a charm and depth that seems to resonate with each generation&quot;.

In 2016, several writers commemorated the 30-year anniversary of the film&#x27;s release. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Charles Bramesco called &quot;Stand By Me&quot; &quot;timeless&quot;, &quot;a staple of youthful nostalgia for its deft straddling of the line between childhood and adulthood&quot;, and &quot;the rare movie that necessarily gets better with time&quot;. Others described the film as a &quot;coming-of-age classic&quot; and as a film that stood at &quot;the apex of the &#x27;80s kids&#x27; movie boom&quot;.

===Events and tourism===
Brownsville, Oregon has held an annual &quot;Stand By Me Day&quot; since 2007. The event has attracted international participants. On July 24, 2010, a 25th Anniversary celebration of the filming of &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was held in Brownsville. The event included a cast and crew Q&amp;A session, an amateur pie-eating contest, and an outdoor showing of the film.

In 2013, July 23 was designated as Stand By Me Day by the Brownsville Chamber of Commerce. To encourage tourism, the city has embedded a penny in the street at a location where the fictional Vern found one in the film. An advertising mural painted for the movie production has survived.

Following the July 2024 Stand By Me Day, its event organizers—after input from businesses, fans, volunteers—decided to schedule the annual event for the fourth Saturday of July.

===Film===

The Oscar-nominated urban drama &quot;Boyz n the Hood&quot; has several direct references to &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, including a trip by four young children to see a dead body, and the closing fade-out of one of the main characters. Director John Singleton stated that he included the references because he was a fan of the movie.

Jonathan Bernstein states the pop culture discussions between characters in films by Quentin Tarantino originate in the similar semi-serious banter between the boys of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

Reviewers have seen an influence from &quot;Stand by Me&quot; in the 2011 movie &quot;Attack the Block&quot;, directed by Joe Cornish.

The movie &quot;Mud&quot; (2012) has a character (Neckbone) who has been called a &quot;perfect fusion of River Phoenix and Jerry O&#x27;Connell in &quot;Stand by Me&quot;&quot;. The writer and director, Jeff Nichols, said of the film &quot;Yeah, you know, I basically remade &quot;Stand by Me&quot;&quot; when defending the work-in-progress to studio executives.

&quot;The Kings of Summer&quot;, a 2013 coming-of-age film by Jordan Vogt-Roberts, has been reviewed as being inspired by &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

&quot;Love and Monsters&quot; (2020) includes an excerpt of the song &quot;Stand by Me&quot; and shortly after a scene involving large poisonous leeches.

===Music===
Dan Mangan&#x27;s song &quot;Rows of Houses&quot; (2011) is based on the film and takes the perspective of Gordie Lachance.

===Production company===
In 1987, following the success of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, Reiner co-founded a film and television production company and named it Castle Rock Entertainment, after the fictional town in which the film is set.

===Television===
* &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, the first television show produced by Reiner&#x27;s Castle Rock production company, featured banter between Jerry Seinfeld and George Costanza that was reminiscent of the dialogue between the protagonists of &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.
* The plotline of &quot;The Blunder Years&quot;, a 2001 episode from the thirteenth season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, revolves around a repressed childhood trauma in which Homer Simpson, along with his friends Lenny and Carl, discover a body blocking an inlet for the Springfield Quarry.
* The &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; episode &quot;The Ricklantis Mixup&quot; makes references to the film with four multi-verse Mortys, and another reference during a campfire.
* The web television series &quot;Do You Want to See a Dead Body?&quot; is inspired by the film, and named after a quote from it.
* In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; season 7 episode &quot;Three Kings&quot; which aired on May 10, 2009, the first segment of the episode parodies the whole film.

===Video games===
The film is referenced in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot; for the Nintendo Game Boy, as well their Game Boy Advance remakes, &quot;Pokémon FireRed&quot; and &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, where the player character&#x27;s mother is watching the movie on TV. When interacting with the TV, the player character says: &quot;There&#x27;s a movie on TV. Four boys are walking on railroad tracks. I better go too.&quot; This reference exists in both the original Japanese versions and the English localizations, though the reference changes to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; in the remakes when the female player character is selected.

<text>Kent County is a county located in the central part of the U.S. state of Delaware. As of the 2020 census, the population was 181,851, making it the least populous county in Delaware. The county seat is Dover, the state capital of Delaware. It is named for Kent, an English county.

Kent County comprises the Dover metropolitan area, which is included in the Philadelphia-Reading-Camden, PA-NJ-DE-MD combined statistical area.

==History==

In about 1670 the English began to settle in the valley of the St. Jones River, earlier known as Wolf Creek. On June 21, 1680, the Duke of York chartered St. Jones County, which was carved out of New Amstel/New Castle and Hoarkill/Sussex counties. St. Jones County was transferred to William Penn on August 24, 1682, and became part of Penn&#x27;s newly chartered Delaware Colony.

Penn ordered a court town to be laid out, and the courthouse was built in 1697. The town of Dover, named after the town of Dover in England&#x27;s Kent, was finally laid out in 1717, in what was then known as the Lower Counties. It was designated as the capital of Delaware in 1777. In 1787 Delaware was first state to ratify the U.S. Constitution, and became &quot;the First State.&quot; Through much of the late 18th century, the economy of Kent County was based on small grain farms. As a result, farmers did not need as many slaves as did owners of tobacco plantations. Delaware had a high proportion of free blacks among its African-American population by the early 19th century. 
In the 1960s, Dover was a center of manufacturing of spacesuits worn by NASA astronauts in the Apollo moon flights by ILC Dover, now based in the small town of Frederica. The suits, dubbed the &quot;A7L,&quot; was first flown on the Apollo 7 mission in October 1967, and was the suit worn by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the Apollo 11 mission. The company still manufactures spacesuits to this day—the present-day Space Shuttle &quot;soft&quot; suit components (the arms and legs of the suit).

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (26.6%) is water.

Kent County, like all of Delaware&#x27;s counties, is subdivided into Hundreds. There are several explanations given for how the Hundreds were arrived at, either being an area containing 100 families, an area containing 100 people, or an area that could raise 100 militiamen. Kent County was originally apportioned into six Hundreds: Duck Creek, Little Creek, Dover, Murderkill, Milford and Mispillion. In 1867, the Delaware legislature split Murderkill Hundred into North Murderkill Hundred and South Murderkill Hundred. In 1869, the legislature formed Kenton Hundred from parts of Little Creek and Duck Creek Hundred. Today the county contains eight Hundreds.

===Amish community===
Kent County is home to an Amish community residing to the west of Dover, consisting of 9 church districts and about 1,650 people. The Amish first settled in Kent County in 1915 after migrations from Wisconsin, Montana, Alabama, and Ohio. The area is home to several Amish businesses selling items such as Amish food, furniture, quilts, and handmade crafts. Every September, the Amish Country Bike Tour, one of the largest cycling events in Delaware, takes place in the area. In recent years, increasing development has led to the decline in the number of Amish living in the community.

<doc id="87985" wikidata="Q633" url="?curid=87985" title="Neil Young">
<text>Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian and American singer-songwriter. After embarking on a music career in Winnipeg in the 1960s, Young moved to Los Angeles, joining the folk rock group Buffalo Springfield. Since the beginning of his solo career, often backed by the band Crazy Horse, he released critically acclaimed albums such as &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; (1969), &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; (1970), &quot;Harvest&quot; (1972), &quot;On the Beach&quot; (1974), and &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (1979). He was also a part-time member of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, with whom he recorded the chart-topping 1970 album &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;.

Young&#x27;s guitar work, deeply personal lyrics and signature high tenor singing voice define his long career. He also plays piano and harmonica on many albums, which frequently combine folk, rock, country and other musical genres. His often distorted electric guitar playing, especially with Crazy Horse, earned him the nickname &quot;Godfather of Grunge&quot; and led to his 1995 album &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; with Pearl Jam. More recently, he has been backed by Promise of the Real.

Young directed (or co-directed) films using the pseudonym &quot;Bernard Shakey&quot;, including &quot;Journey Through the Past&quot; (1973), &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (1979), &quot;Human Highway&quot; (1982), &quot;Greendale&quot; (2003), &quot;CSNY/Déjà Vu&quot; (2008), and &quot;Harvest Time&quot; (2022). He also contributed to the soundtracks of the films &quot;Philadelphia&quot; (1993) and &quot;Dead Man&quot; (1995).

Young has received multiple Grammy and Juno Awards. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has inducted him twice: in 1995 as a solo artist and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Young No. 30 on its list of the &quot;250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot;. Young is also on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 100 greatest musical artists, and 21 of his albums and singles have been certified gold or platinum in the U.S. Young was awarded the Order of Manitoba in 2006 and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2009.

==Early life (1945–1963)==
Neil Young was born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto. His father, Scott Alexander Young (1918–2005), was a journalist and sportswriter who also wrote fiction. His mother, Edna Blow Ragland &quot;Rassy&quot; Young (1918–1990) was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Although Canadian, his mother had American and French ancestry. Young&#x27;s parents married in 1940 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and moved to Toronto shortly thereafter where their first son, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Young, was born in 1942.

Shortly after Young&#x27;s birth in 1945, the family moved to rural Omemee, Ontario, which Young later described fondly as a &quot;sleepy little place.&quot; Young contracted polio in the late summer of 1951 during the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario, and as a result, became partially paralyzed on his left side. After the conclusion of his hospitalization, the Young family wintered in Florida because they believed its mild weather would help Neil&#x27;s convalescence. During that period, Young briefly attended Faulkner Elementary School in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. In 1952, upon returning to Canada, Young moved from Omemee to Pickering (1956) and then lived for a year in Winnipeg (where he would later return) before relocating to Toronto (1957–1960). While in Toronto, he briefly attended Lawrence Park Collegiate Institute as a first-year student in 1959. According to rumor, he was expelled for riding a motorcycle down the hall of the school. He also became interested in the popular music he heard on the radio.

When he was 12, his father, who had had several extramarital affairs, left his mother. She asked for a divorce, which was granted in 1960. She moved back to Winnipeg with Neil joining her there, while his brother, Bob, stayed with their father in Toronto.

During the mid-1950s, Young listened to rock &#x27;n roll, rockabilly, doo-wop, R&amp;B, country, and western pop. He idolized Elvis Presley and later referred to him in a number of his songs. Other early musical influences included Link Wray, Lonnie Mack, Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs, The Ventures, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, Chuck Berry, Hank Marvin, Little Richard, Fats Domino, The Chantels, The Monotones, Ronnie Self, the Fleetwoods, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, and Gogi Grant. Young began to play music on a plastic ukulele, before, as he would later relate, going on to &quot;a better ukulele to a banjo ukulele to a baritone ukulele – everything but a guitar.&quot;

==Career==
===Early career (1963–1966)===

Young and his mother settled in the working-class area of Fort Rouge, Winnipeg, where he enrolled in Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band, the Jades, and met Ken Koblun. While attending Kelvin High School in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands, eventually dropping out of school in favor of a musical career. Young&#x27;s first stable band was the Squires, with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert and Bill Edmondson on drums, who had a local hit called &quot;The Sultan&quot;. Over three years, the band played hundreds of shows at community centers, dance halls, clubs and schools in Winnipeg and other parts of Manitoba. The band also played in Fort William (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer, Ray Dee, whom Young called &quot;the original Briggs,&quot; referring to his later producer David Briggs. While playing at The Flamingo, Young met Stephen Stills, whose band The Company was playing at the same venue, and they became friends. The Squires primarily performed in Winnipeg and rural Manitoba in towns such as Selkirk, Neepawa, Brandon and Giroux (near Steinbach), with a few shows in northern Ontario.

After leaving the Squires, Young worked in folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met Joni Mitchell. Mitchell recalls Young as having been highly influenced by Bob Dylan at the time. Young said Phil Ochs was &quot;a big influence on me,&quot; telling a radio station in 1969 that Ochs was &quot;on the same level with Dylan in my eyes.&quot; Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as &quot;Sugar Mountain&quot;, about lost youth. Mitchell wrote &quot;The Circle Game&quot; in response. The Winnipeg band The Guess Who (with Randy Bachman as lead guitarist) had a Canadian Top 40 hit with Young&#x27;s &quot;Flying on the Ground is Wrong&quot;, which was Young&#x27;s first major success as a songwriter.

In 1965, Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, while in Toronto, he joined the Rick James-fronted Mynah Birds. The band managed to secure a record deal with the Motown label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being AWOL from the Navy Reserve. After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and the bass player Bruce Palmer decided to pawn the group&#x27;s musical equipment and buy a Pontiac hearse, which they used to relocate to Los Angeles. Young admitted in a 1975 interview that he was in the United States illegally until he received a &quot;green card&quot; (permanent residency permit) in 1970.

===Buffalo Springfield (1966–1968)===

Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with Stephen Stills and Richie Furay after a chance encounter in traffic on Sunset Boulevard. Along with Dewey Martin, they formed Buffalo Springfield. A mixture of folk, country, psychedelia, and rock, lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young, made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record, &quot;Buffalo Springfield&quot; (1966) sold well after Stills&#x27; topical song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; became a hit, aided by Young&#x27;s melodic harmonics played on electric guitar. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other sources, Buffalo Springfield helped create the genres of folk rock and country rock.

Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, worsened the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield&#x27;s demise. A second album, &quot;Buffalo Springfield Again&quot;, was released in late 1967, but two of Young&#x27;s three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group. From that album, &quot;Mr. Soul&quot; was the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group performed together.

In May 1968, the band split up for good, but to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final studio album, &quot;Last Time Around&quot;, was released. Young contributed the songs &quot;On the Way Home&quot; and &quot;I Am a Child&quot;, singing lead on the latter.

In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony, writing in a letter to the Hall that their presentation, which was aired on VH1, &quot;has nothing to do with the spirit of Rock and Roll. It has everything to do with making money.&quot;

Young played as a studio session guitarist for some 1968 recordings by The Monkees which appeared on the &quot;Head&quot; and &quot;Instant Replay&quot; albums.

===Going solo, Crazy Horse (1968–1969)===

After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with Reprise Records, home of his colleague and friend Joni Mitchell, with whom he shared a manager, Elliot Roberts. Roberts managed Young until Roberts&#x27; death in 2019. Young and Roberts immediately began work on Young&#x27;s first solo record, &quot;Neil Young&quot; (January 22, 1969), which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview, Young deprecated the album as being &quot;overdubbed rather than played.&quot;

For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called the Rockets: Danny Whitten on guitar, Billy Talbot on bass guitar, and Ralph Molina on drums. These three took the name Crazy Horse (after the historical figure of the same name), and &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; (May 1969) is credited to &quot;Neil Young with Crazy Horse&quot;. Recorded in just two weeks, the album includes &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;, &quot;Cowgirl in the Sand,&quot; and &quot;Down by the River&quot;. Young reportedly wrote all three songs in bed on the same day while nursing a high fever of .

===Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young (1969–1970)===

Shortly after the release of &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,&quot; Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, who had already released one album, &quot;Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&quot;, as a trio in May 1969. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group – winners of the 1969 Best New Artist Grammy Award – was renamed Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young. The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous Woodstock Festival, during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: &quot;One of you fuckin&#x27; guys comes near me and I&#x27;m gonna fuckin&#x27; hit you with my guitar&quot;. During the making of their first album, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he &quot;wanted to play folk music in a rock band.&quot;

Young wrote &quot;Ohio&quot; following the Kent State massacre on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSNY and immediately released as a single, even though CSNY&#x27;s &quot;Teach Your Children&quot; was still climbing the singles charts.

===&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, acoustic tour and &quot;Harvest&quot; (1970–1972)===
Later in the year, Young released his third solo album, &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, Nils Lofgren, Stephen Stills, and CSNY bassist Greg Reeves. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than &quot;Everybody Knows This is Nowhere&quot;, with a wider range of sounds. Young&#x27;s newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best-known work, including &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let It Bring You Down&quot;; the singles &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;When You Dance I Can Really Love&quot;; and the title track, &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, played on piano, with dreamlike lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to environmental concerns. Young&#x27;s bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song &quot;Southern Man&quot; (along with a later song entitled &quot;Alabama&quot;) was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting Lynyrd Skynyrd to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;. However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd&#x27;s music, and the band&#x27;s front man Ronnie Van Zant was later photographed wearing a &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; T-shirt on the cover of an album.
In the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and several new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like &quot;Journey through the Past&quot;, would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like &quot;See the Sky About to Rain&quot;, would only be released in coming years. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at Carnegie Hall and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto&#x27;s Massey Hall, which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, with &quot;Live at Massey Hall 1971&quot; being released in 2007, and other shows as official bootlegs in 2021 and 2022, as a part of Young&#x27;s Archive series.

Near the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the &quot;Johnny Cash&quot; TV show. &quot;The Needle and the Damage Done&quot;, a somber lament on the pain caused by heroin addiction, had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member Danny Whitten, who eventually died while battling his drug problems. While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of Quadrafonic Sound Studios owner Elliot Mazer to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them The Stray Gators, and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer David Briggs, he scrapped plans for the imminent release of the live acoustic recording in favor of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the London Symphony Orchestra at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the Broadway Theatre) during March 1971. The result was Young&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Harvest&quot; (February 14, 1972), which was also the best selling album of 1972 in the US.

After his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (&quot;Broken Arrow Ranch&quot;, where he lived until his divorce in 2014). He wrote the song &quot;Old Man&quot; in honor of the land&#x27;s longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; was inspired by his relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; was released as the first single from &quot;Harvest&quot;, the only No. 1 hit in his career. &quot;Old Man&quot; was also popular, reaching No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, marking Young&#x27;s third and final appearance in the chart&#x27;s Top 40 as a solo artist.

The album&#x27;s recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the &quot;Decade&quot; (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; as the song that &quot;put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.&quot;

===The &quot;Ditch&quot; Trilogy and personal struggles (1972–1974)===
Although a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of &quot;Harvest&quot;, it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent alcohol/diazepam overdose. Young described the incident to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Cameron Crowe in 1975: &quot;[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn&#x27;t cut it. He couldn&#x27;t remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. &#x27;It&#x27;s not happening, man. You&#x27;re not together enough.&#x27; He just said, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?&#x27; And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he&#x27;d OD&#x27;d. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.&quot;

On the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer Kenny Buttrey, a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the hard rock milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer Johnny Barbata, while David Crosby and Graham Nash contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. Young has often said the album assembled in the aftermath, &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; (October 15, 1973), was his least favorite. It was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young&#x27;s Official Release Series). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. &quot;Time&quot; was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which became known collectively to fans as the &quot;Ditch Trilogy&quot;, as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of &quot;Harvest&quot;.

In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse&#x27;s rhythm section augmented by Nils Lofgren on guitar and piano and &quot;Harvest&quot;/&quot;Time Fades Away&quot; veteran Ben Keith on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and roadie Bruce Berry, Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; (June 20, 1975). The album&#x27;s dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so. While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, &quot;On the Beach&quot; (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song &quot;See the Sky About to Rain&quot;, but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like &quot;Time Fades Away&quot;, it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young&#x27;s most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of &quot;On the Beach&quot; described the music as &quot;mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary&quot;.

After completing &quot;On the Beach&quot;, Young reunited with &quot;Harvest&quot; producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, &quot;Homegrown&quot;. Most of the songs were written after Young&#x27;s breakup with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though &quot;Homegrown&quot; was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot;, at the suggestion of Band bassist Rick Danko. Young further explained his move by saying: &quot;It was a little too personal ... it scared me&quot;. Most of the songs from &quot;Homegrown&quot; were later incorporated into other Young albums while the original album was not released until 2020. &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night,&quot; when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the &quot;ditch&quot; trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young&#x27;s own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.

===Reunions, retrospectives and &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (1974–1979)===
Young reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour that was partially recorded; highlights were ultimately released in 2014 as &quot;CSNY 1974&quot;. It was one of the first ever stadium tours and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.

In 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with Frank Sampedro on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, &quot;Zuma&quot; (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot;, a retelling of the Spanish conquest of Mexico from the viewpoint of the Aztecs, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. &quot;Zuma&quot;″s closing track, &quot;Through My Sails&quot;, was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.

In 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album &quot;Long May You Run&quot; (September 20, 1976), credited to The Stills-Young Band; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a telegram that read: &quot;Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil.&quot;

In 1976, Young performed with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and numerous other rock musicians in the high-profile all-star concert &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, the final performance by The Band. The release of Martin Scorsese&#x27;s movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young&#x27;s nose during his performance of &quot;Helpless&quot;. &quot;American Stars &#x27;n Bars&quot; (June 13, 1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the &quot;Homegrown&quot; album, &quot;Homegrown&quot; and &quot;Star of Bethlehem&quot;, as well as newer material, including the future concert staple &quot;Like a Hurricane&quot;. Performers on the record included Linda Ronstadt, Emmylou Harris and Young protégé Nicolette Larson along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation &quot;Decade&quot;, a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.

In June 1977 Young joined with Jeff Blackburn, Bob Mosley and John Craviotto (who later founded Craviotto drums) to form a band called The Ducks. Over seven-week the band performed 22 shows in Santa Cruz CA but were not allowed to appear beyond city limits due to Young&#x27;s Crazy Horse contract. In April 2023 Young officially released a double album of songs culled from the band&#x27;s performances at multiple venues as well as from sessions at a local recording studio. The double album was part of the Neil Young Archives project positioned within the Official Bootleg Series, titled High Flyin&#x27;.

&quot;Comes a Time&quot; (October 2, 1978), Young&#x27;s first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, marked a return to the commercially accessible, Nashville-inspired sound of &quot;Harvest&quot; while also featuring contributions from Larson and Crazy Horse. The album also marked a return to his folk roots, as exemplified by a cover of Ian Tyson&#x27;s &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot;, a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada. Another of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Lotta Love&quot;, was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in February 1979. In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young&#x27;s film &quot;Human Highway&quot;, which took its name from a song featured on &quot;Comes a Time&quot;. Over four years, Young would spend US$3,000,000 of his own money on production (US$ in dollars). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the art punk band Devo, whose members appeared in the film.

Young set out in 1978 on the lengthy &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock zeitgeist of the late 1970s and provided a stark contrast from &quot;Comes a Time&quot;. Two new songs, the acoustic &quot;My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)&quot; and electric &quot;Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)&quot; were the centerpiece of the new material. During the filming of &quot;Human Highway&quot;, Young had collaborated with Devo on a cacophonous version of &quot;Hey Hey, My My&quot; at the Different Fur studio in San Francisco and would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse. The lyric &quot;It&#x27;s better to burn out than to fade away&quot; was widely quoted by his peers and critics. The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music with the bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam having cited Young&#x27;s heavily distorted and abrasive guitar style on the B side to this album as an inspiration. Young also compared the rise of Johnny Rotten with that of the recently deceased &quot;King&quot; Elvis Presley, who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an icon. Rotten returned the favor by playing one of Young&#x27;s songs, &quot;Revolution Blues&quot; from &quot;On the Beach&quot;, on a London radio show, an early sign of Young&#x27;s eventual embrace by several punk-influenced alternative musicians.

Young&#x27;s two accompanying albums &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (July 2, 1979; new material culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and &quot;Live Rust&quot; (November 19, 1979; a genuine concert recording featuring old and new material) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym &quot;Bernard Shakey&quot;. Young worked with rock artist Jim Evans to create the poster art for the film, using the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Jawas as a theme. Young&#x27;s work since &quot;Harvest&quot; had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; named &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; as the year&#x27;s second best album in the Pazz &amp; Jop Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.

===Experimental years (1980–1988)===
After providing the incidental music to the 1980 film &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot;, Young released &quot;Hawks &amp; Doves&quot; (November 3, 1980), a short record pieced together from sessions going back to 1974.

&quot;Re·ac·tor&quot; (1981), an electric album recorded with Crazy Horse, also included material from the 1970s. Young did not tour in support of either album; in total, he played only one show, a set at the 1980 Bread and Roses Festival in Berkeley, between the end of his 1978 tour with Crazy Horse and the start of his tour with the Trans Band in mid-1982.

The 1982 album &quot;Trans&quot;, which incorporated vocoders, synthesizers, and electronic beats, was Young&#x27;s first for the new label Geffen Records (distributed at the time by Warner Bros. Records, whose parent Warner Music Group owns most of Young&#x27;s solo and band catalog) and represented a distinct stylistic departure. Young later revealed that an inspiration for the album was the theme of technology and communication with his son, who could not speak. An extensive tour preceded the release of the album and was documented by the video &quot;Neil Young in Berlin&quot;, which saw release in 1986.

Young&#x27;s next album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Rockin&#x27;&quot;, included several rockabilly covers and clocked in at less than 25 minutes in length. Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting US tour. &quot;Trans&quot; (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head David Geffen for its lack of commercial appeal, and with &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Rockin&quot;″ following seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music &quot;unrepresentative&quot; of himself. The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos – Tim Pope directed the videos for &quot;Wonderin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Cry, Cry, Cry&quot;. Also premiered in 1983, though little seen, was the long-gestating &quot;Human Highway&quot;. Co-directed and co-written by Young, the eclectic comedy starred Young, Dean Stockwell, Russ Tamblyn, Dennis Hopper, David Blue, Sally Kirkland, Charlotte Stewart and members of Devo.

Young did not release an album in 1984, his first unproductive year since beginning his career with Buffalo Springfield in 1966. Young&#x27;s lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1983 country album &quot;Old Ways&quot;. It was also the year when Young&#x27;s third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean, who was later diagnosed with inherited epilepsy.

Young spent most of 1984 and all of 1985 touring for &quot;Old Ways&quot; (August 12, 1985) with his country band, the International Harvesters. The album was finally released in an altered form midway through 1985. Young also appeared at that year&#x27;s Live Aid concert in Philadelphia, collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet&#x27;s first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.

Young&#x27;s last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in the genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young&#x27;s music. Young recorded 1986&#x27;s &quot;Landing on Water&quot; without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, &quot;Life&quot;, which emerged in 1987. Young&#x27;s album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today &quot;Life&quot; remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.

Switching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician Harold Melvin forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a brass section provided a new jazzier sound, and the title track of 1988&#x27;s &quot;This Note&#x27;s For You&quot; became Young&#x27;s first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and Michael Jackson, the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, &quot;What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?&quot; Despite this, the video was eventually named best video of the year by the network in 1989.

Young reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album &quot;American Dream&quot; and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour.

Young attracted criticism from liberals in the music industry when he supported President Ronald Reagan and said he was &quot;tired of people constantly apologizing for being Americans&quot;. In a 1985 interview with &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, he said about the AIDS pandemic: &quot;You go to a supermarket and you see a faggot behind the fuckin&#x27; cash register, you don&#x27;t want him to handle your potatoes.&quot; In the same interview, Young also complained about welfare beneficiaries, saying: &quot;Stop being supported by the government and get out and work. You have to make the weak stand up on one leg, or half a leg, whatever they&#x27;ve got.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in 2013 that Young &quot;almost certainly regrets that horrific statement&quot; and that he &quot;quickly moved away from right-wing politics&quot;.

Young took a turn at acting in 1988 by appearing in the Steven Kovacs film &quot;&#x27;68&quot;. He played the character Westy, cranky owner of a motorcycle shop and fan of Senator Joseph McCarthy.

===Return to prominence (1989–1999)===
Young&#x27;s 1989 single &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot;, which hit No. 2 on the US mainstream-rock charts, and accompanied the album, &quot;Freedom&quot;, returned Young to the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments. The album&#x27;s lyrics were often overtly political; &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President George H. W. Bush.

The use of heavy feedback and distortion on several &quot;Freedom&quot; tracks was reminiscent of the &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of grunge. The rising stars of the subgenre, including Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain and Pearl Jam&#x27;s Eddie Vedder, frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called &quot;The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young&quot; was released in 1989, featuring covers by a range of alternative and grunge acts, including Sonic Youth, Nick Cave, Soul Asylum, Dinosaur Jr, and the Pixies.

Young&#x27;s 1990 album &quot;Ragged Glory&quot;, recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his Northern California ranch, continued this distortion-heavy aesthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band Social Distortion and Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans. &quot;Weld&quot;, a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991. Sonic Youth&#x27;s influence was evident on &quot;Arc&quot;, a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of Thurston Moore and originally packaged with some versions of &quot;Weld&quot;.

1992&#x27;s &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; marked an abrupt return (prompted by Young&#x27;s hyperacusis in the aftermath of the &quot;Weld&quot; tour) to the country and folk-rock stylings of &quot;Harvest&quot; and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including the core members of the Stray Gators and singers Linda Ronstadt and James Taylor. The title track was a minor hit, and the record was well received by critics, winning the Juno Award for Album of the Year in 1994. Young also contributed to lifelong friend Randy Bachman&#x27;s nostalgic 1992 tune &quot;Prairie Town&quot;, and garnered a 1993 Academy Award nomination for his song &quot;Philadelphia&quot;, from the soundtrack of the Jonathan Demme movie of the same name. An &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with Booker T. and the M.G.s for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with Blues Traveler, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; played with Pearl Jam, foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.

In 1994, Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for &quot;Sleeps with Angels&quot;, a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by Kurt Cobain&#x27;s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain&#x27;s life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young&#x27;s lyric &quot;It&#x27;s better to burn out than fade away&quot; (a line from &quot;My My, Hey Hey&quot;) in his suicide note. Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain before his death. Young and Pearl Jam performed &quot;Act of Love&quot; at an abortion rights benefit along with Crazy Horse, and were present at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner, sparking interest in a collaboration between the two. Still enamored with the grunge scene, Young reconnected with Pearl Jam in 1995 for the live-in-the-studio album &quot;Mirror Ball&quot; and a tour of Europe with the band and producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien backing Young. 1995 also marked Young&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, where he was inducted by Eddie Vedder.

In 1995, Young and his manager Elliot Roberts founded a record label, Vapor Records. It has released recordings by Tegan and Sara, Spoon, Jonathan Richman, Vic Chesnutt, Everest, Pegi Young, Jets Overhead, and Young himself, among others.

Young&#x27;s next collaborative partner was filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who asked Young to compose a soundtrack to his 1995 black-and-white western film &quot;Dead Man&quot;. Young&#x27;s instrumental soundtrack was improvised while he watched the film alone in a studio. The death of long-time mentor, friend, and producer David Briggs in late 1995 prompted Young to reconnect with Crazy Horse the following year for the album and tour &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, &quot;Year of the Horse&quot;, emerged in 1997. From 1996 to 1997, Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the H.O.R.D.E. Festival&#x27;s sixth annual tour.

In 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band Phish, sharing the stage at the annual Farm Aid concert and then at Young&#x27;s Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of &quot;Helpless&quot; and &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;. Phish declined Young&#x27;s later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour.

The decade ended with the release in late 1999 of &quot;Looking Forward&quot;, another reunion with Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed quartet earned US$42.1 million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.

===Health condition and new material (2000s)===
Neil Young continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium. The studio album &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; and live album &quot;Road Rock Vol. 1&quot; were released in 2000 and were both accompanied by live concert films. His 2001 single &quot;Let&#x27;s Roll&quot; was a tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks, and the effective action taken by the passengers and crew on Flight 93 in particular.

In 2003, Young released &quot;Greendale&quot;, a concept album recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and Ralph Molina. The songs loosely revolved around the murder of a police officer in a small town in California and its effects on the town&#x27;s inhabitants. Under the pseudonym &quot;Bernard Shakey&quot;, Young directed an accompanying film of the same name, featuring actors lip-synching to the music from the album. He toured extensively with the &quot;Greendale&quot; material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America, Japan, and Australia. Young began using biodiesel on the 2004 Greendale tour, powering his trucks and tour buses with the fuel. &quot;Our Greendale tour is now ozone friendly&quot;, he said. &quot;I plan to continue to use this government approved and regulated fuel exclusively from now on to prove that it is possible to deliver the goods anywhere in North America without using foreign oil, while being environmentally responsible.&quot;

====2005 Health Issues====
In March 2005, while working on the &quot;Prairie Wind&quot; album in Nashville, Young was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive neuroradiological procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29, but two days afterward he passed out on a New York street from bleeding from the femoral artery, which radiologists had used to access the aneurysm. The complication forced Young to cancel his scheduled appearance at the Juno Awards telecast in Winnipeg, but within months he was back on stage, appearing at the close of the Live 8 concert in Barrie, Ontario, on July 2. During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called &quot;When God Made Me&quot;. Young&#x27;s brush with death influenced &quot;Prairie Wind&quot;″s themes of retrospection and mortality.

====Jonathan Demme concert film====
A Jonathan Demme concert film from a 2007 concert at the Tower Theater in Upper Darby Township, Pennsylvania, called the &quot;Neil Young Trunk Show&quot; premiered on March 21, 2009, at the South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Conference and Festival in Austin, Texas. It was featured at the Cannes Film Festival on May 17, 2009, and was released in the US on March 19, 2010, to critical acclaim.

====Glastonbury, Isle of Wight====
In 2009, Young headlined the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and Glastonbury Festival in Pilton, England, at Hard Rock Calling in London (where he was joined onstage by Paul McCartney for a rendition of &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;) and, after years of unsuccessful booking attempts, the Isle of Wight Festival.

=== Increased environmental activism and Promise of the Real (2010s) ===

In May 2010, it was revealed Young had begun working on a new studio album produced by Daniel Lanois. This was announced by David Crosby, who said that the album &quot;will be a very heartfelt record. I expect it will be a very special record.&quot; On May 18, 2010, Young embarked upon a North American solo tour to promote his then upcoming album, &quot;Le Noise&quot;, playing a mix of older songs and new material. Although billed as a solo acoustic tour, Young also played some songs on electric guitars, including Old Black.

In September 2011, Jonathan Demme&#x27;s third documentary film on the singer songwriter, &quot;Neil Young Journeys&quot;, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival.

Neil Young with Crazy Horse released the album &quot;Americana&quot; on June 5, 2012. It was Young&#x27;s first collaboration with Crazy Horse since the &quot;Greendale&quot; album and tour in 2003 and 2004. The record is a tribute to unofficial national anthems that jump from an uncensored version of &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot; to &quot;Clementine&quot; and includes a version of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, which Young grew up singing every day in school in Canada.

&quot;Americana&quot; is Neil Young&#x27;s first album composed entirely of cover songs. The album debuted at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Young&#x27;s highest-charting album in the US since &quot;Harvest&quot;. On June 5, 2012, &quot;American Songwriter&quot; also reported that Neil Young and Crazy Horse would be launching their first tour in eight years in support of the album.

On September 25, 2012, Young&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Waging Heavy Peace: A Hippie Dream&quot; was released to critical and commercial acclaim. Reviewing the book for the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Janet Maslin reported that Young chose to write his memoirs in 2012 for two reasons: he needed to take a break from stage performances for health reasons but continue to generate income; and he feared the onset of dementia, considering his father&#x27;s medical history and his own present condition. Maslin praised the book, describing it as frank but quirky and without pathos.

In November 2013, Young performed at the annual fundraiser for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. Following the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he played an acoustic set to a crowd who had paid a minimum of $2,000 a seat to attend the benefit in the famous Paramour Mansion overlooking downtown Los Angeles.

Young released the album &quot;A Letter Home&quot; on April 19, 2014, through Jack White&#x27;s record label, and his second memoir, entitled &quot;Special Deluxe&quot;, which was released on October 14. He appeared with White on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; on May 12, 2014.

Young released his thirty-fifth studio album, &quot;Storytone&quot; on November 4, 2014. The first song released from the album, &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Stand Up?&quot;, was released in three different versions on September 25, 2014.

&quot;Storytone&quot; was followed in 2015 by his concept album &quot;The Monsanto Years&quot;. &quot;The Monsanto Years&quot; is an album themed both in support of sustainable farming, and to protest the biotechnology company Monsanto. Young achieves this protest in a series of lyrical sentiments against genetically modified food production. He created this album in collaboration with Willie Nelson&#x27;s sons, Lukas and Micah, and is also backed by Lukas&#x27;s fellow band members from Promise of the Real. Additionally, Young released a film in tandem with the album, (also entitled &quot;The Monsanto Years&quot;), that documents the album&#x27;s recording, and can be streamed online. In August 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported Young, among other environmental activists, was being spied on by the firm.

In summer 2015, Young undertook a North American tour titled the Rebel Content Tour. The tour began on July 5, 2015, at the Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and ended on July 24, 2015, at the Wayhome Festival in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real were special guests for the tour.

In October 2016, Young performed at Desert Trip in Indio, California, and announced his thirty-seventh studio album, &quot;Peace Trail&quot;, recorded with drummer Jim Keltner and bass guitarist Paul Bushnell, which was released that December.

On September 8, 2017, Young released &quot;Hitchhiker&quot;, a studio LP recorded on August 11, 1976, at Indigo Studios in Malibu. The album features ten songs that Young recorded accompanied by acoustic guitar or piano. While different versions of most of the songs have been previously released, the new album will include two never-before-released songs: &quot;Hawaii&quot; and &quot;Give Me Strength&quot;, which Young has occasionally performed live.

On July 4, 2017, Young released the song &quot;Children of Destiny&quot; which would appear on his next album. On November 3, 2017, Young released &quot;Already Great&quot;, a song from &quot;The Visitor&quot;, an album he recorded with Promise of the Real and released on December 1, 2017.

On Record Store Day, April 21, 2018, Warner Records released a two-vinyl LP special edition of &quot;&quot;, a double live album of a show that Young performed in September 1973 at the Roxy in West Hollywood, with the Santa Monica Flyers. The album is labeled as &quot;Volume 05&quot; in Young&#x27;s &quot;Performance Series.&quot;

On October 19, 2018, Young released a live version of his song &quot;Campaigner&quot;, an excerpt from a forthcoming archival live album titled &quot;Songs for Judy&quot;, which features solo performances recorded during a November 1976 tour with Crazy Horse. It will be the first release from his new label Shakey Pictures Records.

In December 2018, Young criticized the promoters of a London show for selecting Barclays Bank as a sponsor. Young objected to the bank&#x27;s association with fossil fuels. Young explained that he was trying to rectify the situation by finding a different sponsor.

On August 19, 2019, Neil Young and Crazy Horse announced the forthcoming release later in August 2019 of the new song &quot;Rainbow of Colors&quot;, the first single from the album &quot;Colorado&quot;, Young&#x27;s first new record with the band in seven years, since 2012&#x27;s &quot;Psychedelic Pill&quot;. Young, multi-instrumentalist Nils Lofgren, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina recorded the new album with Young&#x27;s co-producer, John Hanlon, in spring 2019. &quot;Colorado&quot; was released on October 25, 2019, on Reprise Records. On August 30, 2019, Young unveiled &quot;Milky Way&quot;, the first song from &quot;Colorado&quot;, a love ballad he had performed several times at concerts – both solo acoustic and with Promise of the Real.

=== 2020s ===
In February 2020, Young wrote an open letter to President Trump, calling him a &quot;disgrace to my country&quot;. On August 4, 2020, Young filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Trump&#x27;s reelection campaign for the use of his music at campaign rallies.

In April 2020, Young announced that he was working on a new archival album, &quot;Road of Plenty&quot;, comprising music made with Crazy Horse in 1986 and rehearsals for his 1989 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appearance. On June 19, Young released a &quot;lost&quot; album, &quot;Homegrown.&quot; He recorded it in the mid-1970s following his breakup with Carrie Snodgress, but opted not to release it at the time, feeling it was too personal. In September, Young released a live EP, &quot;The Times&quot;. Young shared the news via his video for his new song &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Leader&quot;, stating: &quot;I invite the President to play this song at his next rally. A song about the feelings many of us have about America today.&quot;

Young and Crazy Horse released a new album, &quot;Barn&quot;, on December 10, 2021. The first single, &quot;Song of the Seasons&quot;, was released on October 15, followed by &quot;Welcome Back&quot; on December 3, along with a music video. A stand-alone will be released on Blu-ray and will be directed by Daryl Hannah. Young also confirmed that he had completed his third book, &quot;Canary&quot;, his first work of fiction.

On January 24, 2022, Young posted an open letter threatening to remove his music from the audio streaming service Spotify if it did not remove the &quot;Joe Rogan Experience&quot; podcast. Young accused the podcast of spreading COVID-19 misinformation on December 31, writing that &quot;Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform&quot;. On January 26, Young&#x27;s music was removed from Spotify. A Spotify spokesperson said that Spotify wanted &quot;all the world&#x27;s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users&quot; and that it had a &quot;great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators&quot;. In solidarity, artists including Joni Mitchell and the members of Crosby, Stills, and Nash also removed their music from Spotify. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also praised Young. In March 2024, Young returned his music to Spotify, as the end of Joe Rogan&#x27;s contract meant Rogan could add &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; to other streaming platforms, such as Apple Music and Amazon Music. Young said he could not sustain his opposition on each of the platforms.

In 2023, Young criticized Ticketmaster&#x27;s practice of raising ticket prices and adding fees. He said he had been sent letters from fans blaming him for US$3,000 tickets for a benefit concert he was performing, and that &quot;artists have to worry about being ripped off fans blaming them for Ticketmaster add-ons and scalpers&quot;.

In April and May 2024, Young returned to touring with Crazy Horse for the first time in ten years (for their Love Earth Tour), and unveiled a &quot;lost&quot; verse from &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; that had been unknown for years. Micah Nelson, son of Willie Nelson, joined Crazy Horse for the tour, as Nils Lofgren was busy touring with Bruce Springsteen as a member of the E Street Band. However, two members of the group became ill in May, and Young announced that the remainder of their tour (including dates in July and festivals in September) would be cancelled indefinitely.

In late 2024, Young began playing with a new backing band, called the Chrome Hearts. The band consists of Promise of the Real members Micah Nelson (guitar), Corey McCormick (bass) and Anthony Logerfo (drums), alongside organist Spooner Oldham. They released their debut single, &quot;Big Change&quot; in January 2025, with producer John Hanlon describing the song as &quot;in your face loud irreverent rock’n’roll paint splatter on the canvas in the vein of a Jackson Pollack painting.&quot; A full studio album is expected to be released in 2025, with an accompanying world tour, which includes a headline performance at Glastonbury Festival.

==Archives project==

Since 2006, Young has been maintaining the Neil Young Archives, a project which encompasses the release of live albums, starting in 2006 with &quot;Live at the Fillmore East&quot;, box sets of live and studio material, starting in 2009 with &quot;The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972&quot;, as well as video releases. , the project has evolved into a subscription website and application where all of his music is available to stream in high resolution audio. Neil Young Archives also includes his newspaper, &quot;The Times-Contrarian&quot;, The Hearse Theater, and photographs and memorabilia from throughout his career.

==Activism, philanthropy and humanitarian efforts==
Young has been a lifelong, committed environmentalist and outspoken advocate for the welfare of small farmers, having co-founded in 1985 the benefit concert Farm Aid.

===Farm Aid===
Young remains on the board of directors of Farm Aid, an organization he co-founded with Willie Nelson and John Mellencamp in 1985. According to its website, it is the longest running concert benefit series in the US and it has raised $43 million since its first benefit concert in 1985. Each year, Young co-hosts and performs with well-known guest performers including Dave Matthews and producers including Evelyn Shriver and Mark Rothbaum, at the Farm Aid annual benefit concerts to raise funds and provide grants to family farms and prevent foreclosures, provide a crisis hotline, and create and promote homegrown farm food in the United States.

===Bridge School===
In 1986, Young helped found the Bridge School, an educational organization for children with severe verbal and physical disabilities, and its annual supporting Bridge School Benefit concerts, together with his then-wife Pegi Young.

===Songwriting activism===
While Young had never been a stranger to eco-friendly lyrics, themes of environmentalist spirituality and activism became increasingly prominent in his work throughout the 1990s and 2000s, especially on &quot;Greendale&quot; (2003) and &quot;Living with War&quot; (2006). The trend continued on 2007&#x27;s &quot;Chrome Dreams II&quot;, with lyrics exploring Young&#x27;s personal eco-spirituality.

Young&#x27;s renewed activism manifested itself in the 2006 album &quot;Living with War&quot;, which like the much earlier song &quot;Ohio&quot;, was recorded and released in less than a month as a direct result of current events. Most of the album&#x27;s songs rebuked the Bush administration&#x27;s policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes and an outright protest song entitled &quot;Let&#x27;s Impeach the President&quot;, in which he asserted that Bush had lied to lead the country into war.

===LincVolt hybrid electric car===

In 2008, Young revealed the production of a hybrid-engine 1959 Lincoln called LincVolt. A new album loosely based on the Lincvolt project, &quot;Fork in the Road&quot;, was released on April 7, 2009.

===Indigenous rights, Fossil Fuel, and Old Growth logging activism===

Young has been a vocal opponent of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas. When discussing the environmental impact on the oilsands of Fort McMurray, Alberta, Young asserted that the area now resembles the Japanese city of Hiroshima in the aftermath of the atomic bomb attack of World War II.

Young has referred to issues surrounding the proposed use of oil pipelines as &quot;scabs on our lives&quot;. In an effort to become more involved, Young has worked directly with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation to draw attention to this issue, performing benefit concerts and speaking publicly on the subject. In 2014, he played four shows in Canada dedicated to the Honor the Treaties movement, raising money for the Athabasca Chipewyan legal defense fund.

In 2015, he and Willie Nelson held a festival in Neligh, Nebraska, called &quot;Harvest the Hope&quot;, raising awareness of the impact of oilsands and oil pipelines on Native Americans and family farmers. Both received honors from leaders of the Rosebud Sioux, Oglala Lakota, Ponca and Omaha nations, and were invested with sacred buffalo robes.

Young participated in the Blue Dot Tour, which was organized and fronted by environmental activist David Suzuki, and toured all 10 Canadian provinces alongside other Canadian artists, including the Barenaked Ladies, Feist, and Robert Bateman. The intent of Young&#x27;s participation in this tour was to raise awareness of the environmental damage caused by the exploitation of oilsands. Young has argued that the amount of released as a byproduct of oil and oil extraction is equivalent to the amount released by the total number of cars in Canada each day.

Young has faced criticism from representatives from within the Canadian petroleum industry, who have claimed that his statements are irresponsible. Young&#x27;s opposition to the construction of oil pipelines has influenced his music as well. His song, &quot;Who&#x27;s Going to Stand Up?&quot; was written to protest this issue, and features the lyric &quot;Ban fossil fuel and draw the line / Before we build one more pipeline&quot;.

In addition to directly criticizing members of the oil industry, Young has also focused blame on the actions of the Canadian government for ignoring the environmental impacts of climate change. He referred to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper as &quot;an embarrassment to many Canadians ... [and] a very poor imitation of the George Bush administration in the United States&quot;. Young was also critical of Barack Obama&#x27;s government for failing to uphold the promises made regarding environmental policies during his election campaign.

===Anti-logging of Old Growth protests===
In 2023, Young and Daryl Hannah travelled by train to Victoria on short notice to offer their support to 1,200 Old Growth activists who had been arrested unlawfully at the Fairy Creek old-growth logging protests. Young played a short set to draw attention to the issue, and hearten the activists, some of whom had been pepper sprayed and assaulted by RCMP officers, trying to protect the last at-risk intact watershed of Old Growth in southern BC.

Young recorded &quot;A Rock Star Bucks a Coffee Shop&quot; in response to Starbucks&#x27; possible involvement with Monsanto and use of genetically modified food. The song was included on his 2015 concept album &quot;The Monsanto Years&quot;.

Young is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

== Artistry ==
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that the styles explored by Young throughout his career span &quot;everything from noise-rock and synth pop to blues and rockabilly&quot;. He also noted the &quot;electro experiments&quot; on &quot;Trans&quot; and &quot;noisy guitar jams&quot; &quot;on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot;.

==Instruments==
===Guitars===
In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed Young as eighty-third in its ranking of &quot;The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; (although in a more recent version of the list, he has been moved up to seventeenth place), describing him as a &quot;restless experimenter ... who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory&quot;. Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he uses frequently just a few instruments, as is explained by his longtime guitar technician Larry Cragg in the film &quot;Neil Young: Heart of Gold&quot;. They include:
* a late 1950s Gretsch White Falcon purchased by Young near the end of the Buffalo Springfield era. In 1969, he bought a version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young&#x27;s early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like &quot;Ohio&quot;, &quot;Southern Man&quot;, &quot;Alabama&quot;, &quot;Words (Between the Lines of Age)&quot;, and &quot;L.A.&quot;. It was Young&#x27;s primary electric guitar during the &quot;Harvest&quot; (1972) era, since Young&#x27;s deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul (a favorite of his named Old Black) difficult.
===Reed organ===
Young owns a restored Estey reed organ, serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert.

===Crystallophone===
Young owns a glass harmonica, which he played in the recording of &quot;I Do&quot; on his 2019 album &quot;Colorado&quot;.

===Amplification===
Young uses various vintage Fender Tweed Deluxe amplifiers. His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 (US$ in dollars) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound.

A notable and unique accessory to Young&#x27;s Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier&#x27;s settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an effects pedal. Tom Wheeler&#x27;s book &quot;The Soul of Tone&quot; highlights the device on pages 182–183.

==Personal life==
Young&#x27;s family was from Manitoba, where both his parents were born and married. Young himself was born in Toronto, Ontario, and lived there at various times in his early life (1945, 1957, 1959–1960, 1966–1967), as well as Omemee (1945–1952) and Pickering, Ontario (1956) before settling with his mother in Winnipeg, Manitoba (1958, 1960–1966), where his music career began and which he considers his &quot;hometown&quot;. After becoming successful, he bought properties in California. Young had a home in Malibu, California, which burned to the ground in the 2018 Woolsey Fire. Young had lived outside Canada since 1967, before returning in 2020.

Young owned Broken Arrow Ranch, a property of about 1,000 acres near La Honda, California, which he purchased in 1970 for US$350,000 (US$ in dollars); the property was subsequently expanded to thousands of acres. He moved out and gave Pegi Young the ranch after their divorce in 2014. Young&#x27;s son Ben lives there.

===Citizenship===
Young announced in 2019 that his application for United States citizenship had been held up because of his use of marijuana. In 2020, the issue was resolved and he became a United States citizen. Almost immediately upon gaining US citizenship, Young returned to living in Canada for the first time in over half a century, as he and Daryl Hannah moved to a cottage near Omemee, the town where he had originally lived from shortly after his birth until the age of 7.

=== Marriages and relationships ===
Young married his first wife, restaurant owner Susan Acevedo, in December 1968. They were together until October 1970, when she filed for divorce.

From late 1970 to 1975, Young was in a relationship with actress Carrie Snodgress. The song &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; from &quot;Harvest&quot; is inspired by his seeing her in the film &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot;. They met soon afterward, and she moved in with him on his ranch in northern California. They have a son, Zeke, who was born on September 8, 1972. He has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy.

Young met his next wife, Pegi Young ( Morton), in 1974 when she was working as a waitress at a diner near his ranch, a story he tells in the 1992 song &quot;Unknown Legend.&quot; They married in August 1978 and had two children together, Ben and Amber. Ben has been diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and Amber with epilepsy. The couple were musical collaborators and co-founders of the Bridge School, in 1986. They divorced in 2014 after 36 years of marriage. Pegi died on January 1, 2019.

In 2014, Young began dating actress Daryl Hannah. The couple wed on August 25, 2018, in Atascadero, California.

Young has been widely reported to be the godfather of actress Amber Tamblyn; in a 2009 interview with &quot;Parade&quot;, Tamblyn explained that &quot;godfather&quot; was &quot;just a loose term&quot; for Young, Dennis Hopper, and Dean Stockwell, three famous friends of her father, Russ Tamblyn, who were important influences on her life.

Young has always been close with his half sister and fellow musician Astrid Young, buying her first amplifier and collaborating over the past decades.

==Business ventures==
Young was part owner of Lionel, LLC, a company that makes toy trains and model railroad accessories. In 2008 Lionel emerged from bankruptcy and his shares of the company were wiped out. He was instrumental in the design of the Lionel Legacy control system for model trains, and remains on the board of directors of Lionel. He has been named as co-inventor on seven US patents related to model trains.

===PonoMusic===
Young has long held that the digital audio formats in which most people download music are deeply flawed, and do not provide the rich, warm sound of analog recordings. He claims to be acutely aware of the difference, and compares it with taking a shower in tiny ice cubes versus ordinary water. Young and his company PonoMusic developed Pono, a music download service and dedicated music player focusing on &quot;high-quality&quot; uncompressed digital audio. It was designed to compete against highly compressed MP3 type formats. Pono promised to present songs &quot;as they first sound during studio recording&quot;. The service and the sale of the player were launched in October 2014.

===Back catalog sale===
In January 2021, Young sold 50% of the rights to his back catalog to the British investment company Hipgnosis Songs Fund. The value was estimated to be at least $150 million.

==Legacy and influence==
Young&#x27;s political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as Blind Melon, Phish, Pearl Jam, and Nirvana. Young is referred to as the &quot;godfather of grunge&quot; for his influence on Kurt Cobain and Eddie Vedder and the grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995. Thom Yorke of Radiohead said &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; gave him the confidence to reveal &quot;softness and naiveté&quot; in vocals. He also credited Young as a lyrical influence. He said: &quot;It was his attitude toward the way he laid songs down. It&#x27;s always about laying down whatever is in your head at the time and staying completely true to that, no matter what it is.&quot; 

The Australian rock group Powderfinger named themselves after Young&#x27;s song &quot;Powderfinger&quot; from &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; (1979). The members of the Constantines occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze. Young has been cited as an influence by alternative rock acts such as Sonic Youth, Dinosaur Jr., Johnny Marr, Meat Puppets, Nada Surf frontman Matthew Caws, and the Feeder singer Grant Nicholas. Jason Bond, an East Carolina University biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it &quot;Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi&quot; after Young, his favorite singer.

As one of the founders of Farm Aid (1985–), he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in Mountain View, California, Young and his ex-wife hosted the Bridge School Concerts, which drew international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades. He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. In 2000, Young was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; at number 71, &quot;Harvest&quot; at number 78, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; (with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young) at number 148, &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; at number 208, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; at number 331, and &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; at number 350. The 2023 updated version of this list includes &quot;Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere&quot; at 407, &quot;On The Beach&quot; at 311, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; at 302, &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; at 296, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; at 220, &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; at 90, and &quot;Harvest&quot; at 72. In 2004, on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot; at number 214, &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; at number 297, &quot;Cortez the Killer&quot; at number 321, and &quot;Ohio&quot; (with Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young) at number 385. In their updated 2021 version, Neil Young appears with &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; at number 259, &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot; at 322, and &quot;Powderfinger&quot; at 450.

In 2006, when &quot;Paste&quot; magazine compiled a &quot;Greatest Living Songwriters&quot; list, Young was ranked second behind Bob Dylan. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other&#x27;s records). He ranked thirty-ninth on &quot;VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock&quot; that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has &quot;avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young&#x27;s peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.&quot;

&quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;, &quot;Harvest&quot;, &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;, and &quot;Ohio&quot; have all been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award by the civil liberties group People for the American Way. Young was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year on January 29, 2010, two nights before the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. He was also nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for &quot;Fork in the Road&quot; and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for &quot;Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963–1972)&quot;. Young won the latter Grammy Award. In 2010, he was ranked No. 26 in Gibson.com&#x27;s Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.

In 2022, Young was named by Carnegie Corporation of New York as an honoree of the Great Immigrants Award.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Young at number 133 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

Other honors include:

*Canadian Music Hall of Fame, 1982
*Rock and Roll Hall of Fame He has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: first in 1995 for his solo work and in 1997 as a member of Buffalo Springfield.
* In 2006, Artist of the Year by the American Music Association.

<text>New Castle County is the northernmost of the three counties of the U.S. state of Delaware (New Castle, Kent, and Sussex). As of the 2020 census, the population was 570,719, making it the most populous county in Delaware, with nearly 60% of the state&#x27;s population of 989,948. The county seat is Wilmington, which is also the state&#x27;s most populous city. New Castle County is included in the Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA-NJ-DE-MD Metropolitan Statistical Area. The county is named after William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle (–1676). New Castle County has the highest population and population density of any Delaware county, and it is the smallest county in the state by area. It has more people than the other two counties, Kent and Sussex, combined. It is also the most economically developed of the three.

==History==
The first permanent European settlement on Delaware soil was Fort Christina, resulting from Peter Minuit&#x27;s 1638 expedition on the Swedish vessels &quot;Fogel Grip&quot; and &quot;Kalmar Nyckel&quot;. The Swedes laid out the town at the site of modern-day Wilmington. They contracted with the Lenape Native Americans for land of Old Cape Henlopen north to Sankikans (Trenton Falls), and inland as far as they desired. However, a dispute ensued between the Swedes and the Dutch, who asserted a prior claim to that land.

In 1640, New Sweden was founded a few miles south of Christina. In 1644, Queen Christina appointed Lt. Col. Johan Printz as Governor of New Sweden. She directed boundaries to be set and to reach Cape Henlopen north along the west side of Godyn&#x27;s Bay (Delaware Bay), up the South River (Delaware River), past Minquas Kill (Christina River), to Sankikans (Trenton Falls). Printz settled on Tinicum Island, as the seat of government and capital of the New Sweden colony.

Peter Stuyvesant, Governor of New Netherland, sailed up the South River in 1651. He purchased land from the Lenape that covered Minquas Kill to Bompties Hook (Bombay Hook); the Lenape had sold part of the property to the Swedes in 1638. Stuyvesant began to build Fort Casimir (contemporary New Castle).

In 1654, Johan Risingh, commissary and councilor to the governor Lt. Col. Printz, officially assumed Printz&#x27;s duties and began to expel all Dutch from New Sweden. Fort Casimir surrendered and was renamed Fort Trinity in 1654. The Swedes had complete possession of the west side of the Delaware River. On June 21, 1654, the Lenape met with the Swedes to reaffirm the purchase.

Having learned of the fall of Fort Casimir, the Dutch sent Stuyvesant to drive the Swedes from both sides of the river. They allowed only Dutch colonists to settle in the area and on August 31, 1655, the territory was converted back to Fort Casimir. Consequently, Fort Christina fell on September 15 to the Dutch, was renamed Fort Altena and New Netherland ruled once again. John Paul Jacquet was immediately appointed governor, making New Amstel the capital of the Dutch-controlled colony.

The Dutch West India Company conveyed land from the south side of Christina Kill to Bombay Hook, and as far west as Minquas land. This land was known as the Colony of The city. On December 22, 1663, the Dutch transferred property rights to the territory along the Delaware River to England.

In 1664, the duke of York, James, was granted this land by King Charles II. One of the first acts by the Duke was to order removal of all Dutch from New Amsterdam; he renamed New Amstel as New Castle. In 1672, the town of New Castle was incorporated and English law ordered. However, in 1673, the Dutch attacked the territory, reclaiming it for their own.

On September 12, 1673, the Dutch established New Amstel in present-day Delaware, fairly coterminous with today&#x27;s New Castle County. The establishment was not stable, and it was transferred to the British under the Treaty of Westminster on February 9, 1674. On November 6, 1674, New Amstel was made dependent on New York Colony, and was renamed New Castle on November 11, 1674.

On September 22, 1676, New Castle County was formally placed under the Duke of York&#x27;s laws. It gained land from Upland County on November 12, 1678.

On June 21, 1680, St. Jones County was carved from New Castle County. It is known today as Kent County, Delaware. On August 24, 1682, New Castle County, along with the rest of the surrounding land, was transferred from the Colony of New York to the possession of William Penn, who established the Colony of Delaware.

In September 1673, a Dutch council established a court at New Castle with the boundaries defined as north of Steen Kill (present-day Stoney Creek) and south to Bomties Hook (renamed Bombay Hook). In 1681, a 12-mile arc was drawn to specifically delineate the northern border of New Castle County as it currently exists. In 1685, the western border was finally established by King James II; this was set as a line from Old Cape Henlopen (presently Fenwick) west to the middle of the peninsula and north up to the middle of the peninsula to the 40th parallel.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (13.8%) is water. The boundaries of New Castle County are described in § 102 of the Delaware Code. The county is drained by Brandywine Creek, Christina River, and other channels. Its eastern edge sits along the Delaware River and Delaware Bay.

Two small exclaves of the county and the state lie across the Delaware River, on its east bank on the New Jersey side, Finns Point adjacent to Pennsville Township, New Jersey, and the northern tip of Artificial Island, adjacent to Lower Alloways Creek Township, New Jersey.

New Castle County, like all of Delaware&#x27;s counties, is subdivided into hundreds. New Castle County is apportioned into eleven hundreds: Brandywine, Christiana, Wilmington (the city of Wilmington, which, by law, is a hundred in itself), Mill Creek, White Clay Creek, Pencader, New Castle, Red Lion, St. Georges, Appoquinimink, and Blackbird.

Ebright Azimuth, the highest natural point in Delaware at , is located in New Castle County.

The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal was built through New Castle County, and adjoining Cecil County, Maryland, between 1822 and 1829.

====County Council====

The county&#x27;s legislative body is a thirteen-member county council, consisting of twelve members elected by district and one president elected at large. The council is tasked with drafting laws and managing county government services, public health ordinances, land use, transportation, and zoning. New Castle County Council doubled in size to thirteen from seven members in 2004. Its most famous council member was Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States, who represented the 4th district from 1971 to 1973.

====County judiciary====
As with Delaware&#x27;s other two counties, New Castle County has no judiciary of its own. All judicial functions, except for Alderman&#x27;s Courts, are managed and funded by the state of Delaware. In New Castle County, only the cities of Newport and Newark have alderman&#x27;s courts. These courts have jurisdiction over driving offenses, misdemeanor criminal charges, and minor civil claims.

====County row offices====
The county retains the concept of &quot;row offices&quot; from Pennsylvania, so-called because all of these county offices could be found in a row in smaller courthouses. In Delaware, these offices are clerk of the peace, recorder of deeds, register of wills, and sheriff.

The office of clerk of the peace is unique among the 50 states; the office-holder&#x27;s function is almost exclusively to perform marriages. The current incumbent is Kenneth W. Boulden Jr. (D)

The recorder of deeds is Michael Kozikowski (D). His office is responsible for receiving and recording deeds, mortgages and satisfactions thereof, assignments, commissions of judges, notaries, and military officers. The recorder of deeds&#x27; office is heavily computerized; electronic images of all recent documents and many others are available the office is in the process of imaging further back with the eventual goal of all documents in the office&#x27;s possession being available electronically. Computerized indexing and searching is also available.

The register of wills is Ciro Poppiti, III. His office receives and records wills and small-estate affidavits upon an individual&#x27;s death, and issues letters of administration to estate executors.

The sheriff of New Castle County has two divisions, criminal and civil. The criminal division is based in the New Castle County Courthouse in Wilmington. The deputies assigned to this division organize and manage capias returns. They also transport prisoners for Superior Court, Court of Common Pleas, and Family Court. The civil division serves legal process, performs levies &amp; impounds and sells property in satisfaction of judgments. The civil division also locates and apprehends individuals wanted for civil capias. The current sheriff is Scott T. Phillips.

====County zoning and public works====
New Castle County has a strong zoning code, known as the Unified Development Code, or UDC. The UDC was developed by the Gordon Administration in response to public perception of over- and misdevelopment in the county. New building projects must go through a process of application and approval before construction is permitted to begin.

By operation of state law, New Castle County has no responsibility whatsoever for maintenance of roadways. Public roadways are maintained exclusively by the Delaware Department of Transportation, while roadways within neighborhoods and developments are, pursuant to County code, maintained by homeowners&#x27; or neighborhood associations.

The Department of Public Works maintains essential infrastructure elements such as sanitary sewers and drainage ways. It also maintains County-owned parks and buildings such as County libraries. It does not maintain the water distribution system, which is owned and operated by several private companies. In general, it also does not maintain stormwater management facilities within subdivisions.

====County public safety====
Access to 911 emergency services is provided by New Castle County through their emergency communications center for all fire/rescue/emergency medical services (EMS) throughout the county and the majority of police services, though Newark, Wilmington, and the University of Delaware maintain their own police emergency call centers. New Castle County has its own nationally accredited police department. The New Castle County Police Department is the second largest police organization in the state of Delaware. New Castle County maintains a county wide police force with authorization to enforce laws throughout the county, including within incorporated municipalities. The county police force is supported by local municipality police agencies in Middletown, Newark, Delaware City, Wilmington, Newport, Elsmere, the city of New Castle, the University of Delaware, as well as the Delaware State Police.

New Castle County also operates a nationally accredited, county-run paramedic service through its Emergency Medical Services Division. NCC*EMS is the advanced life support (ALS) component of a two-tiered, paramedic intercept EMS system. County paramedics are located in eight full-time stations and one part-time station that operates during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., with a capability of calling in additional personnel during major emergencies or planned events. Basic life support (BLS) ambulance service is provided primarily by volunteer fire companies with the use of paid employees that are trained in fire suppression and EMS. Fire/Rescue protection is provided by twenty-one volunteer fire departments throughout the county. The city of Wilmington has its own career municipal fire department and contracts with a private ambulance service for basic life support coverage. The contracted private ambulance service in Wilmington operates in a tiered response configuration with the New Castle County Paramedics.

The Paul J. Sweeney Public Safety Building, located in Minquadale off of US 13, houses the New Castle County Police and Emergency Medical Services Division Headquarters and the emergency communications center supporting 9-1-1 services. The present building opened in 2007 with a construction cost of . The Headquarters occupied a former elementary school building on the same site prior to erection of the current building.

===Federal government===
New Castle is a strongly Democratic county. Because its population is almost double the combined population of Kent and Sussex, the winner in New Castle County has also won Delaware overall in each of the last eighteen presidential elections. In 1992, 2000, 2004 and 2016, the Republican candidate carried Kent and Sussex, only to lose New Castle by double digits–enough of a margin to swing the entire state to the Democrats. New Castle was a bellwether from 1936 to 1996, as it backed the national winner in every presidential election. It became the longest-running national bellwether after 1996, when Okanogan County, Washington, voted for Bob Dole. In 2000, Valencia County, New Mexico became the longest presidential bellwether.

Former governor Ronald Reagan won the county by just one vote over President Jimmy Carter in 1980. The county was won by the Republican presidential candidate from 1980 through 1988. This changed when Bill Clinton won the county in 1992 and, like many urban counties, New Castle stayed Democratic ever since.
 The county warmly supported former senator and Wilmington resident Joe Biden as Barack Obama&#x27;s running mate in 2008 and 2012, and during his own bid for president in 2020, each time with well over 65 percent of the vote–more than enough to carry Delaware.











===State government===
The Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth, and Their Families (DSCYF) has its headquarters in the Delaware Youth and Family Center (DYFC), located in unincorporated New Castle County, near Wilmington. Several DSCYF juvenile facilities, including the New Castle County Detention Center (NCCDC), the Ferris School for Boys, and the Grace and Snowden Cottages are in unincorporated New Castle County.

Several Delaware Department of Correction facilities are located in the county. The James T. Vaughn Correctional Center (JTVCC), formerly the Delaware Correctional Center, is a men&#x27;s prison in unincorporated New Castle County, housing sentenced prisoners; Vaughn opened in 1971. The Howard R. Young Correctional Institution, renamed from Multi-Purpose Criminal Justice Facility in 2004 and housing both pretrial and posttrial male prisoners, is located in Wilmington; it opened in 1982. The Delores J. Baylor Correctional Institution, a women&#x27;s prison housing pretrial and posttrial prisoners, is located in unincorporated New Castle County. Baylor opened on December 29, 1991. The Delaware male death row was in the JTVCC, while the female death row was in Baylor. Executions were to occur at JTVCC, prior to the 2016 suspension of it by the Delaware Supreme Court.

New Castle elects a substantial majority of the state legislature, with 27 state house districts and 17 state senate districts based in the county.

==Communities==

New Castle County is home to two minor league sports teams: the Wilmington Blue Rocks (baseball) and the Delaware Blue Coats (basketball), both of which play in Wilmington.

<text>Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars, commonly known as Secret Wars, is a 12-issue American comic book crossover limited series published from May 1984 to April 1985 by Marvel Comics. The series was written by Jim Shooter, with art by Mike Zeck and Bob Layton. It was tied in with a similarly named toy line from Mattel and a role-playing game of the same name from TSR, Inc.

==Publication history==
The series was conceived by Marvel Comics&#x27; editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. The series was announced under the title &quot;Cosmic Champions&quot; in the eleventh issue of the &quot;Marvel Age&quot; news magazine, cover dated February 1984. The series was renamed following feedback from Mattel&#x27;s focus group, which indicated that children responded positively to the words &#x27;wars&#x27; and &#x27;secret.&#x27; Mattel&#x27;s involvement influenced the storyline and character design, including making Doctor Doom and Iron Man&#x27;s armor more high-tech to appeal to kids. They also requested new fortresses, vehicles, and weapons to increase play value and promote playsets. Shooter believed he was the only one capable of writing the series.

Crossover titles include &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #249–252, &quot;The Avengers&quot; #242–243, &quot;Captain America&quot; #292, &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; (vol. 2) #294–295, &quot;Iron Man&quot; #181–183, &quot;The Thing&quot; #10–22, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #265, &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #141, &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #178–181, and &quot;Thor&quot; #341. In 1987, &quot;Thor&quot; #383 was presented as a previously untold tale from &quot;Marvel Superheroes Secret Wars&quot;.

==Plot==

A cosmic entity, the Beyonder, becomes fascinated with Earth&#x27;s superheroes in the mainstream Marvel universe. He creates &quot;Battleworld,&quot; a planet in a distant galaxy, and stocks it with weapons and technology. He teleports groups of heroes and supervillains against their will to Battleworld, declaring: &quot;I am from beyond! Slay your enemies and all that you desire shall be yours! Nothing you dream of is impossible for me to accomplish!&quot;

The heroes include the Avengers (Captain America, Captain Marvel, Hawkeye, Iron Man, She-Hulk, Thor, the Wasp, and the Hulk), three members of the Fantastic Four (Human Torch, Mister Fantastic and the Thing), solo heroes (Spider-Man and Spider-Woman) and the mutant team the X-Men (Colossus, Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Professor X, Rogue, Storm, Wolverine, and Lockheed the Dragon). Magneto is featured as a hero, but immediately becomes non-aligned when the Avengers question his presence. In 2015, &quot;Deadpool&#x27;s Secret Secret Wars&quot; revealed that Deadpool was also a chosen hero, but the Wasp accidentally caused the other characters to forget his involvement.

The villains include the Absorbing Man, Doctor Doom, Doctor Octopus, the Enchantress, Kang the Conqueror, Klaw, the Lizard, the Molecule Man, Titania, Ultron, Volcana, and the Wrecking Crew. The cosmic entity Galactus also appears as a villain who immediately becomes a non-aligned entity.

The heroes (with the X-Men choosing to remain a separate unit) and villains have several skirmishes. Ultron is drained of energy by Galactus, who then tries to confront the Beyonder while Doctor Doom observes, but both are easily defeated and sent crashing down to Battleworld. When everyone else reaches Battleworld, Magneto leaves the heroes feeling rejected and Kang blasts Doctor Doom to the heroes&#x27; base when he tries to rally the villains. The heroes win the first skirmish, causing the villains to fall back, only to be assaulted by Ultron, having been rebuilt by Doctor Doom. The heroes then attack Magneto, but he captures Wasp and takes her to his fortress where they are trapped by the weather; the X-Men decide to join Magneto. Doom creates villainesses Titania and Volcana, then leads the remaining villains in a successful assault on the heroes and their base, which they bury under a mountain. After Thor and the Enchantress return from elsewhere, Thor vanishes trying to fight the villains. Doom also has Ultron kill Kang as payback.

When the X-Men arrive to fight Magneto, they form an alliance but Wasp leaves. The Hulk is revealed to have saved everyone from the mountain. Thor also returns, having hidden his escape with lightning. The heroes find a village brought to Battleworld where Galactus has summoned his ship so he can consume the planet. Everybody fights him. Doom&#x27;s faction returns and attacks the heroes, while he sneaks onto Galactus&#x27; ship and persuades Klaw to join the villains. Professor X has the X-Men fall back and then attack the villains who are attacking volcanoes set off by Cyclops. Colossus falls in love with an alien healer named Zsaji. Wasp befriends the Lizard but is gravely wounded by the Wrecking Crew before being returned to the heroes. The second Spider-Woman, Julia Carpenter, is introduced.

The X-Men win another battle against the villains. Galactus sends Doom back to his base, where he notices the volcanoes and tries to fix the planet. Professor X tells Captain America to fight the villains while they take care of Galactus. Zsaji revives Wasp. In the villain&#x27;s base, Hulk and Thor show Spider-Man an alien device that they have used to recreate their clothing. Spider-Man finds and wears his black costume for the first time. Galactus begins to devour the planet. Mr. Fantastic suggests they let him, then the Beyonder will take away his eternal hunger, but Captain America and everyone else convinces him against it. Back at the heroes&#x27; base, Doctor Doom uses Klaw&#x27;s body to create a machine that absorbs Galactus&#x27; power, even after he absorbs his own ship instead. With his newfound power, Doctor Doom steals the Beyonder&#x27;s power.

Molecule Man brings the villains to Volcana&#x27;s apartment on Battleworld then takes the suburb of Denver back to Earth. Doom summons the heroes to his new &quot;Tower of Doom&quot; where he revives Kang and sends him back to his own time in front of them and reveals that Galactus was taken away by Nova. He kills all the heroes with a bolt when they refuse to join him and attack. Zsaji revives them at the cost of her life, and they battle Klaw and monsters he created, including Ultron, while Doom&#x27;s powers go out of control thanks to Klaw convincing him to use them again. While Wasp destroys Ultron and the others take care of the rest, the Beyonder, who had possessed Klaw, takes back his powers and teleports Doom and Klaw away. After Zsaji&#x27;s funeral, everyone finds out that the energy from the Beyonder that was released has turned Battleworld into a place where wishes are granted. Soon Mr. Fantastic builds a portal that can take everyone home. However, the Thing, having gained the ability to revert to his original human form of Ben Grimm at will, chooses to remain on Battleworld for a year to explore the galaxy.

The next issues of series tie-ins with &quot;Secret Wars&quot; open right after the return of the Marvel combatants. Immediate developments include: She-Hulk replaced the Thing in the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man has a new costume initially unaware that it is actually an alien symbiote (the symbiote would subsequently bond with journalist Eddie Brock, giving birth to the villain known as Venom), Colossus ends his romantic relationship with a heartbroken Kitty Pryde, and the Hulk has an injured leg from Ultron in addition to the Hulk&#x27;s savage side re-emerging (culminating in a totally animalistic, inarticulate, and mindless Hulk in #299–300).

==Reception==
&quot;Secret Wars&quot; was a best-seller when it was published in 1984, selling more copies than any other comic in the previous 25 years. While it was a financial success, it was not well received by critics when it was published, being criticized for its uninspired and juvenile content. An announcement of a sequel series, &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, from Carol Kalish, Marvel&#x27;s Direct Sales Manager at the time, was first met with boos. Kalish was even quoted saying: &quot;Let&#x27;s be honest. &quot;Secret Wars&quot; was crap, right? But did it sell?&quot;

In 2011, IGN listed &quot;Secret Wars&quot; as one of the best comic book events. Their writers found the action and goofiness of the story to be enjoyable. They also highlighted the effect it had on the Marvel Universe by introducing the symbiote and new characters. In 2011, Alex Zalben of MTV News ranked &quot;Secret Wars&quot; as the second biggest comic event ever, after only DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; event. Zalben praised &quot;Secret Wars&quot;&#x27; story and lasting effect on the Marvel universe, as well as honoring the storyline as the &quot;semi-official first Event Comics ever.&quot;

==Battleworld==

Battleworld is a fictional patchwork planet that serves as the setting in Secret Wars. There have been three Battleworlds in total. The first was created by the Beyonder, the second was an imitation created by the Stranger pretending to be the Beyonder, and the third was created by Doctor Doom by stealing the power of the Beyonders.

===Publication history===
The first Battleworld debuted in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; (1984) #1, and was created by Jim Shooter and Mike Zeck.

The second Battleworld debuted in &quot;Beyond!&quot;, and was created by Dwayne McDuffie and Scott Kolins.

The third Battleworld debuted in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015) #2, and was created by Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribić.

===Fictional planet biography===

====First Battleworld====
The Beyonder merged dozens of fragments from many planets (including a suburb of Denver, Colorado, from Earth), to create Battleworld, intended to provide an unfamiliar environment where all contestants could use their powers to the fullest. Many peoples, both alien and human, were brought along &quot;for the ride&quot; by this method; it was because of this that Spider-Woman II was on Battleworld, as was Zsaji, the healer, who had brief romances with both the Human Torch of the Fantastic Four and Colossus of the X-Men.

In the aftermath of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, the planet became infected with cosmic energy when the Beyonder reclaimed his stolen power from Doctor Doom. This led to a &quot;wish fulfillment&quot; phenomenon whereby force of will could alter reality; for example, repairing Captain America&#x27;s unbreakable shield or allowing Mister Fantastic to create a way to take them quickly home. This may be due to the Beyonder&#x27;s nature as an incomplete Cosmic Cube, which allows the wielder to alter reality by force of will, or was an aspect of the &quot;heart&#x27;s desire&quot; promised by the Beyonder and granted to the winners of the &quot;Secret Wars.&quot; All the heroes left the planet, except for Ben Grimm. He stayed behind because he was able to change to and from his human form while on the planet&#x27;s surface; his adventures were recounted in his own side-series while She-Hulk took his place in the Fantastic Four. After Ben returned home—he had defeated Ultron and slain his manifested dark side Grimm the Sorcerer—the planet had no more reason to exist and broke apart.

It is unknown whether all pieces returned to their home planets; the fragment of Colorado was ferried back to Earth with its citizens and the &quot;Secret Wars&quot;&#x27; villains by Molecule Man.

====Second Battleworld====
A mock Battleworld appeared in the miniseries &quot;Beyond!&quot; It was constructed by the Stranger posing as the Beyonder for the purposes of studying various combatants from Earth under the guise of battle. This faux Battleworld was destroyed at the end of the miniseries by the departure of the irate Stranger with Gravity holding it together long enough for his group to escape at the cost of his life. Gravity was later resurrected by Epoch as the new Protector of the Universe.

====Third Battleworld====
A third Battleworld appeared in the 2015 series &quot;Secret Wars&quot;. Before the incursions destroyed the Multiverse, Doctor Doom, the Molecule Man, and Doctor Strange had defied the godlike entities behind the catastrophe: the Beyonders. Doctor Doom used a secret weapon made up of a multitudinous number of Molecule Men to defeat these Beyonders and usurp their omnipotence for himself. Afterwards, he salvaged the remaining realities and merged them into Battleworld, made in his own image and filled with mindwiped residents who worshipped him as God Emperor. In truth, it was actually the Molecule Man who had absorbed the Beyonders&#x27; power and Doom was being lent it. To hide this, Doom kept the Molecule Man hidden away and claimed that he had died.

Battleworld was divided into domains which are ruled by an appointed &quot;Baron&quot; or a &quot;Baroness&quot;; while most domains have the ability to interact with each other, the borders of each domain are clearly defined and travel between different domains is discouraged as it requires special dispensation from the local Baron or from God Emperor Doom himself. Only the Deadlands (which contains the Marvel Zombies), Perfection (which contains the Ultron Sentinels), and New Xandar (which contains the Annihilation Wave) are separated from the rest by the Shield (a giant version of Ben Grimm) because each contains threats that if loosed would destroy the other domains.

Battleworld is protected by the Thor Corps who serve as Battleworld&#x27;s police force and answer to God Emperor Doom. Battleworld is orbited by a small Sun, in fact the Human Torch, consigned to the role for acting against Doctor Doom. Knowhere acts as Battleworld&#x27;s moon. Besides these two and Battleworld itself, there were originally no more celestial bodies in its universe until Singularity, a mysterious young girl who actually represents a pocket universe that gained sentience during the multiversal collapse, appears to give her life to save the citizens of Arcadia from a horde of Zombies which made the stars appear in the sky.

This Battleworld would eventually collapse after God Emperor Doom&#x27;s Beyonders&#x27; power was transferred to Reed Richards, who was considered by Doom himself and Molecule Man to be more worthy, and rectified the artificial reality.

As part of the &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; event, it is revealed that the reality where Battleworld was fashioned was identified as Earth-15513 and became a distorted portion of time and space after the destruction of the planet, however due to Battleworld&#x27;s reality having been the epicenter of this Multiversal renewal, it became rich in a substance known as Iso-8, a material identified as the byproduct of creation itself. When the Elders of the Universe of the restored Earth-616 realized that the Multiverse had endured a death and a rebirth, the Collector and Grandmaster discovered the remnants of Battleworld and resolved to fight for the possession of the Iso-8 and used the broken shell as the arena (known as Battlerealm) for their Contest of Champions, a competition where several individuals, taken from Battleworld and the reborn Multiverse, fought to the death on behalf of each Elder. The highest prize was the Iso-Sphere which contained within the Power Primordial, the concentrated and most powerful form of the Iso-8. After assuming control of the Power Primordial that the Grandmaster and Collector were competing for, the Battleworld version of Maestro recreates Battleworld to its previous form as he had previously vowed that he would become the God-King of Battleworld. To combat the remaining players, Maestro summoned the remnants of the Avengers and Thunderbolts from an alternate reality where Iron Man became President of the United States after winning the superhuman civil war as well as summoning Sentry of Earth-1611 to deal with the remaining Contest of Champions competitors. When the Iso-Sphere was stolen from Maestro by Outlaw, he used its power to banish Maestro from Battleworld and teleport the contestants to wherever they wanted to be. As a consequence of Outlaw wishing that the Contest of Champions end, the Iso-Sphere shattered. A group of the contestants decided to remain in Battleworld, forming the Civil Warriors to guard the Iso-8 and the shards of the Iso-Sphere.

The following is a list of the domains and the Marvel Comics event titles that are their basis or reimagining as fully revealed on Marvel Comics&#x27; Interactive Battleworld map in &quot;Secret Wars&quot; #2:

==Sequels==
One year later, &quot;Secret Wars II&quot; was published, with the Beyonder visiting Earth and having a tie-in with almost every Marvel comic book written at the time.

Marvel published a third &quot;Secret Wars&quot; tale written by Steve Englehart and drawn by Keith Pollard within two issues of the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; series: the &quot;Secret Wars III&quot; story in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #318–319 (September–October 1988).

In 2006, a six issue series entitled &quot;Beyond!&quot; was published by Marvel. Written by Dwayne McDuffie and illustrated by Scott Kolins, it referred back to the original Secret Wars event with a similar premise as the Beyonder again transported superheroes and supervillains of Earth to fight on Battleworld.

&quot;Spider-Man &amp; the Secret Wars&quot;, a Marvel Adventures all-ages non-canonical miniseries, was released in 2010. It tells the story from Spider-Man&#x27;s perspective and features major discrepancies with the original event. These tales include him receiving the Beyonder&#x27;s power and creating &quot;New Parker City&quot;, Spider-Man and the Thing spying on Dr. Doom, and a story featuring Spider-Man&#x27;s suspicions concerning the Hulk. It was released in conjunction with &quot;Avengers &amp; The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; and &quot;Captain America &amp; The Korvac Saga&quot;, similar self-contained, all-ages re-imaginations of past events, that appear to take place in their own separate continuities in the standard &quot;Marvel Adventures&quot; manner.

The four-issue miniseries &quot;Deadpool&#x27;s Secret Secret Wars&quot; was released during the 2015 &quot;Secret Wars&quot; event. It retold the events of the original miniseries from Deadpool&#x27;s point of view and used retroactive continuity to fix inconsistencies with later stories. In the end, the Wasp accidentally caused everyone to forget his involvement in the storyline, creating the inconsistencies.

A four-issue miniseries titled &quot;Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars: Battleworld&quot; was released in conjunction with the 40th anniversary of the original series, beginning in November 2023. The series starred Spider-Man and the Human Torch and claimed to &quot;expose never-before-told secrets&quot; from the 1984 storyline.

===&quot;What If?&quot;===
Some issues of &quot;What If?&quot; revolve around the Secret Wars:

* &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Jay Faerber and Gregg Schigiel explored what would happen if the heroes became stranded on Battleworld after Galactus and the Beyonder destroy each other in battle. The battle continues for a while, but after the deaths of Bulldozer, Captain Marvel, Cyclops, Doctor Octopus, Kang, Magneto, and Spider-Woman, both sides declare peace. The Hulk heads into the wilderness to find a way to get everyone back home while Doctor Doom builds a replica of his Latverian castle. The Enchantress disappears, Mister Fantastic somehow dies, and Spider-Man&#x27;s black costume causes him to turn cold and accelerates his aging to the point of becoming a skeleton. Eventually, some of the inhabitants have children who inherit some of their powers including Bravado (the son of Thor and Enchantress), Chokehold (the daughter of Absorbing Man and Titania), Crusader (the daughter of Captain America and Rogue), Firefly (the son of Human Torch and Wasp), Gator (the son of Lizard), Malefactor (the son of Doctor Doom and Enchantress making him the half-brother of Bravado), Moleculon (the son of Molecule Man and Volcana), Mustang (the son of Hawkeye and She-Hulk), Raze (the son of Wrecker), and Torrent (the son of Storm and Wolverine). By Bravado&#x27;s 18th birthday, Malefactor disposes of his father and gathers Chokehold, Gator, Klaw, Moleculon, and Raze in a plot to take over Battleworld. Bravado, Crusader, Firefly, Mustang, Torrent, and the heroes and reformed villains defeat them. The Hulk and Doctor Doom (who faked his death when Malefactor attacked him) return to help end the conflict. The Hulk has used 30th century technology from the deceased Kang to create a portal that will take everyone home with the help of Thor&#x27;s hammer. Uatu soon appears and warns them of the bad thing that will happen if they return to Earth. Though the adults call off the trip, the younger heroes sneak out at night and end up on Earth, which is overrun with Sentinels. The five agree to stay on Earth as the Avengers and liberate Earth. On a related note, these five had appeared in the &quot;Destiny War&quot; storyline.
* In another alternate universe, Doctor Doom retains the Beyonder&#x27;s power and takes over the universe.

===&quot;Secret Wars&quot; (2015 comic book)===

In May 2015, Marvel published a new &quot;Secret Wars&quot; miniseries, written by Jonathan Hickman and drawn by Esad Ribić, that picked up from where the &quot;Time Runs Out&quot; storyline running in &quot;Avengers&quot; and &quot;New Avengers&quot; at the time had ended. The storyline involved the Marvel Universe combining with other alternate universes, including the Ultimate Universe, as well as the 2099 Universe, to form Battleworld, a world which exhibits aspects of the various universes. The core limited series was nine issues long, and ran for eight months, ending in January 2016. One of the core miniseries, &quot;Ultimate End&quot;, had ended the Ultimate Marvel imprint after 15 years at the time. &quot;Ultimate End&quot; is written by Brian Michael Bendis and artist Mark Bagley, the team that began the Ultimate Marvel universe with &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;.

===&quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;===
In &quot;Spider-Man: Life Story&quot;, which depicts an alternate version of the Marvel Universe (designated Earth-19529) where characters aged in real time and debuted in the same year as their first issue publications, the Secret Wars began in 1984 when a number of United States-based superheroes were transported to Battleworld by the Beyonder. This causes the start of the &quot;Russian War&quot; (the World War III of this reality) on Earth due to the absence of the majority of America&#x27;s superheroes. Among them was Spider-Man, who received the Venom symbiote/black costume like his Earth-616 counterpart.

==In other media==
===Television===
* &quot;Secret Wars&quot; serves as inspiration for a self-titled three-part episode of &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1994). In this version of events, the Beyonder and Madame Web task Spider-Man with leading the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, Captain America, Storm, and the Black Cat in liberating Battleworld from Doctor Octopus, Doctor Doom, Alistair Smythe, the Lizard, and the Red Skull to test his capability in saving the multiverse from Spider-Carnage. Amidst production of the episode, the cast of &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; were due to appear. However, the cost of transportation from Canada to Los Angeles proved too costly, leading to most of the X-Men being dropped. Moreover, the Hulk and She-Hulk were excluded due to &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; being on UPN. Additionally, Spider-Man obtaining his black suit is adapted into the earlier episode &quot;The Alien Costume&quot;.
* &quot;Secret Wars&quot; serves as inspiration for the fourth season of &quot;Avengers Assemble&quot;, &quot;Avengers: Secret Wars&quot;. After learning of Earth from Loki, the Beyonder uses the Bifröst to take and combine parts of Earth, Asgard, and the multiverse to form Battleworld as part of an experiment. After getting caught in this, the Avengers and New Avengers, among others, join forces to undo the merge and defeat the Beyonder and Loki.

===Film===
A film titled &quot;&quot; is in development and will be released on May 7, 2027.

===Video games===
* Battleworld appears in &quot;Marvel Contest of Champions&quot; and its 2020 spin-off &quot;Marvel Realm of Champions&quot;.
* A variation of Battleworld, renamed Primary Earth, appears in &quot;Marvel Future Revolution&quot;. This version was created after Vision sacrificed himself to save his Earth from multiverse-destroying incursions.

===Literature===
In 2016, &quot;Secret Wars&quot; received a novelization written by Alex Irvine.

===Merchandise===
* Mattel released three waves of action figures, vehicles, and accessories in the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; toy line from 1984 to 1985.
* An original page of the 1984 &quot;Marvel Superheroes Secret Wars&quot;, showing Spider-Man wearing the black suit for the first time, was sold by Heritage Auctions in January 2022 for over $3 million.

===Miscellaneous===

* Funko released a collectible card game called &quot;Marvel Battleworld&quot;, which is loosely inspired by the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; comic book events.
* Battleworld appears in a self-titled web series.

<text>Sussex County is a county in the southern part of the U.S. state of Delaware, on the Delmarva Peninsula. As of the 2020 census, the population was 237,378, making it the state&#x27;s second most populated county only behind New Castle and ahead of Kent. The county seat is Georgetown.

The first European settlement in the state of Delaware was founded by the Dutch in 1631 near the present-day town of Lewes on the Atlantic Coast. However, Sussex County was not organized until 1683 under English colonial rule.

Sussex County forms the Seaford, Delaware, Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

===Beginnings===
Archaeologists estimate that the first inhabitants of Sussex County, the southernmost county in Delaware, arrived between 10,000 and 14,000 years ago. Various indigenous cultures occupied the area, especially along the river and the coast, often having seasonal fishing villages. Historic Native Americans in Sussex County were members of Algonquian-speaking tribes, as were most coastal peoples along the Atlantic Coast.

By the historic period of European encounter, the most prominent tribes in the area were the Lenape, whose territory extended through the mid-Atlantic states to Connecticut and the future New York metropolitan area, and Nanticoke tribes. The people settled along the numerous bodies of water in the area where they were able to harvest fish, oysters, and other shellfish in the fall and winter. In the warmer months the women planted and cultivated crops, and processed the food. The men hunted deer and other small mammals, as larger game was not present in the area.

===European discovery===
There is no agreement on which European group was the first to settle in Sussex County. Historians believe that, in the early years of exploration from 1593 to 1630, Swedish explorers were likely the first Europeans to see the Delaware River and the lands of present-day Sussex County.

On an expedition for the Dutch West India Company, Henry Hudson recorded discovery in 1609 of what was later named the Delaware River. Attempting to follow him, Samuel Argall, an English explorer, was blown off course in 1610 and landed in a strange bay which he named after the Governor of Virginia, Thomas West, Lord De La Warr.

In the first half of 1613, Cornelius Jacobsen Mey, a Dutch navigator, discovered and named both Cape May and Cape Henlopen (originally Hindlopen) in the Delaware Bay. Later it was found that what May had named Henlopen was Fenwick Island, protruding into the Atlantic Ocean. The name of the cape was moved to its present location just east of Lewes.

===European settlement===
Sussex County was the site of the first European settlement in Delaware, a Dutch trading post named Zwaanendael at the present site of Lewes. On June 3, 1631, Dutch captain David Pietersen de Vries landed along the shores of the Delaware to establish a whaling colony in the mid-Atlantic of the New World. The colony lasted only until 1632, when De Vries left. Upon returning to Zwaanendael that December, he found the Indian tribes had killed his men and burned the colony. The Dutch set about settling the area once again.

Although the Dutch and Swedes returned to resettle the Delaware River region as early as 1638, much of the Delaware Bay area south of what is today the city of Newcastle was not settled until 1662. At that time, the city of Amsterdam made a grant of land at the Hoernkills (the area around Cape Henlopen, near the current town of Lewes) to a party of Mennonites. A total of 35 men were to be included in the settlement, led by a Pieter Cornelisz Plockhoy of Zierikzee, and funded by a sizable loan from the city to get them established. This settlement, established in 1663, was organized in part by the Dutch to respond to threats from the English colony of Maryland to the west beginning to assert rights over the area. The English wrested control of New Netherland from the Dutch in 1664 and they destroyed the Mennonite settlement that same year; English reports indicated that “not even a nail” was left there.

Settlement in the area after the English ejected the Dutch was slow. The Swedes and Finns who had settled in the area from the days of New Sweden had generally welcomed the English and were allowed to stay; the few Dutch found in the area were rounded up as prisoners and sent to Virginia as slaves. Lord Baltimore encouraged Marylanders to move east to settle the area. But the land was far removed from other, more established settlements and did not appeal to many new settlers. It was a tempting wilderness base for pirates to hide out from authorities and regularly pillage settlers for supplies.

The Dutch briefly recaptured the territory in 1673 as part of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. At that point, they established courts in the town of New Castle and at the Hoerkill at the southern end of the territory, effectively creating two counties out of the territory. After the war concluded in 1674, the Delaware territory was returned to the English. It was then placed under the control of James Stuart, Duke of York.
In 1680, the Duke reorganized the territory south of the Mispillion River as Deale County with the county seat at New Deale (modern-day Lewes); and created a third county, St. Jones, out of the Delaware territory between the Mispillion River and Duck Creek. In 1682, English King Charles II awarded the Delaware territories to William Penn in settlement of family debts, and Penn reorganized all three Delaware counties: Deale County become Sussex County, and St. Jones County became Kent County, in recognition of Penn&#x27;s homelands in the county of Sussex, England. He brought 200 people from Sussex, England as colonists. The town of New Deale was renamed Lewistown (today known as Lewes). At this time, Penn claimed that the Delaware territory extended as far south as Fenwick Island. The &#x27;Three Lower Counties&#x27; (Delaware) along Delaware Bay were considered under Penn&#x27;s sphere of settlement and became the Delaware Colony, a satellite of Pennsylvania.

But the boundary disputes continued between Pennsylvania and Maryland. Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore and William Penn both claimed the land between the 39th and 40th parallels, according to the charters granted to each colony. Whereas Penn claimed the Delaware territories extended to Fenwick Island, Calvert claimed the Maryland Colony ended at Lewes, with all the land south of the settlement belonging to Somerset County.

In 1732 Charles Calvert signed a territorial agreement with William Penn&#x27;s sons that drew a line somewhere in between the two colonies and renounced Calvert&#x27;s claim to Delaware. But Lord Baltimore later claimed that the document he signed did not contain the terms he had agreed to, and refused to put the agreement into effect. Beginning in the mid-1730s, violence erupted between settlers claiming various loyalties to Maryland and Pennsylvania. The border conflict between Pennsylvania and Maryland would be known as Cresap&#x27;s War.

In 1750–1751, a team of surveyors from both colonies surveyed and marked the Transpeninsular Line, which established the southern boundary of Sussex County. However, residents of the disputed territory continued to pay taxes to Maryland into the 1770s.

The issue was unresolved until the Crown intervened in 1760, ordering Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore to accept the 1732 agreement. As part of the settlement, the Penns and Calverts commissioned the English team of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon to survey the newly established boundaries between the Province of Pennsylvania, the Province of Maryland, Delaware Colony and parts of Colony and Old Dominion of Virginia.

Between 1763 and 1767, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon surveyed the Mason-Dixon line, settling Sussex County&#x27;s western borders. After Pennsylvania abolished slavery in 1781, the western part of this line and the Ohio River became a border between free and slave states. Although Delaware remained a slave state, it already had a number of free blacks, and slaveholders manumitted more slaves in the first two decades after the Revolution.

The resolution of the boundary dispute enlarged Sussex County considerably, and the new territory was nicknamed New Sussex.

In 1769 a movement started to move the county seat from Lewes to the area then known as Cross Roads, the present day site of Milton. The current county seat of Georgetown was settled upon on January 27, 1791, after residents in western Sussex County successfully petitioned the Delaware General Assembly to move the county seat to a central location, as the limited roads at the time made it too difficult for outlying residents to reach the county seat in Lewes.

Georgetown was not a previously established town. On May 9, 1791, the 10 commissioners headed by President of the State Senate George Mitchell negotiated the purchase of , and Commissioner Rhodes Shankland began the survey by laying out &quot;a spacious square of each way.&quot; Eventually the town was laid out in a circle across. It was centered on the original square surveyed by Shankland, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Georgetown was named after Senate President George Mitchell.

Sussex County has been known by several names over the years, including Susan County, Hoorenkill or Whorekill County as named by the Dutch prior to 1680 when Kent County broke off. From 1680 to 1682 it was known as Deale County, after being taken over by the British under James Stuart, Duke of York prior to signing over to William Penn. It was called Durham County when claimed by the Lords Baltimore during the boundary dispute with the Penn family.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (21.7%) is water. It is the largest county in Delaware by area. The county&#x27;s land area comprises 48.0 percent of the state&#x27;s land area. It is the second-highest percentage of territory of a state of any county in the United States.

Sussex County, like Delaware&#x27;s two other counties, is subdivided into Hundreds. There are several explanations given for how the Hundreds were determined: as an area containing 100 families, an area containing 100 people, or an area that could raise 100 soldiers. Sussex County is apportioned into eleven Hundreds: Cedar Creek, Broadkill, Georgetown, Nanticoke, Northwest Fork, Broad Creek, Little Creek, Dagsboro, Baltimore, Indian River, and Lewes &amp; Rehoboth.

The eastern portion of the county is home to Delaware&#x27;s beaches on the Atlantic Coast and many seaside resorts. The western side of the county is the center of Delaware&#x27;s agriculture, industry with more acres of arable land under cultivation than anywhere else in the state.

Sussex County is home to an extensive system of Southern saltwater and freshwater wetlands, notably the Great Cypress Swamp. This massive freshwater swamp contains the northernmost strand of Bald Cypress trees in the United States. In addition, Zigzag Swamp is located within Sussex County.

Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge is a along the western shore of Delaware Bay. The refuge contains a variety of habitats, including freshwater and salt marshes, woodlands, grasslands, ponds, and forested areas, supporting 267 species of birds and a variety of reptiles, amphibians and mammals.

===Climate===
Sussex County has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. The Trewartha climate classification only has the area along the Atlantic Coast up to Cape Henlopen and Lewes as &quot;Cf&quot; and the remainder of the county as &quot;Do&quot; (oceanic.) Three months average above 22 °C (71.6 °F), all months average above freezing, and seven to eight months average above . The hardiness zone is 7b except near the coast where it is 8a. 

==Government==
Unlike Northern Delaware, particularly New Castle County, Sussex County is highly conservative. Sussex County has only supported a Democrat for president three times since 1944.

This was the only county in Delaware that Barack Obama did not carry in either of his presidential bids, despite the presence of Delawarean Joe Biden on the ballot. Biden himself lost the county by 11 points in his own successful bid for president in 2020. Nonetheless, while Sussex County rejected the Obama-Biden presidential ticket in 2008, Biden carried it in his simultaneous 2008 Senate run (as he did in six of his seven successful Senate campaigns), meaning some voters in the county rejected Biden as a vice presidential candidate while simultaneously supporting him for Senate.


















Sussex County&#x27;s government is composed of an elected county council and various elective executive heads of departments. The county council has five members, who serve four-year terms; all are elected from single-member districts. They form the legislative authority of the county, and choose a &quot;County Administrator&quot; or executive.

The county council members are Council President Michael H. Vincent (R, District 1), Cynthia Green (R, District 2), Mark Schaeffer (R, District 3), Douglas B. Hudson (R, District 4), and Vice President John L. Rieley (R, District 5).

The additional offices of Clerk of the Peace, Register of Deeds, Register of Wills and Sheriff are elected at-large. These positions are held by Norman A. Jones Jr. (R), Alexandra Reed Baker (R), Gregory Fuller (R), and Robert Lee (R), respectively.

Sussex County is split between five state senate districts and nine state house districts.

State Senate:

*District 6 – Russ Huxtable (D)
*District 18 – David L. Wilson (R)
*District 19 – Brian G. Pettyjohn (R)
*District 20 – Gerald Hocker (R)
*District 21 – Bryant Richardson (R)

State House of Representatives:

*District 14 – Pete Schwartzkopf (D)
*District 20 – Stell Parker Selby (D) 
*District 35 – Jesse Vanderwende (R)
*District 36 – Bryan Shupe (R)
*District 37 – Ruth Briggs King (R)
*District 38 – Ronald E. Gray (R)
*District 39 – Daniel Short (R)
*District 40 – Timothy Dukes (R)
*District 41 – Richard Collins (R)

==Education==

===Public===

Sussex County is served by eight public school districts.
* Cape Henlopen School District
* Delmar School District
* Indian River School District
* Laurel School District
* Milford School District (also serves Kent County)
* Seaford School District
* Woodbridge School District (also serves Kent County)
* Sussex Technical School District (County-wide overlay school district)

The county also contains one charter school, the Sussex Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

Those state funded public high schools which participate in sporting events are members of the Henlopen Conference.

===Private===
There are several private schools in Sussex County: Bible Center Christian Academy (Laurel), Children Craft CO (Seaford), Delmarva Christian High School (Georgetown, Destiny Christian School (Georgetown), Eagle&#x27;s Nest Christian School (Milton), Epworth Christian School (Laurel), Greenwood Mennonite School (Greenwood), Harbor Christian Academy (Ellendale), The Jefferson School (Georgetown), Jesus Is Lord Christian Academy (Georgetown), Lighthouse Christian School (Dagsboro), Lighted Pathway Christian Academy (Seaford), Milford Christian School (Milford) and Seaford Christian Academy (Seaford).

The University of Delaware also maintains a marine science campus in Lewes.

==Culture==
The culture in Sussex County is much like that found in other Delmarva counties. Sussex County is starkly different from the rest of the Mid-Atlantic and is much like that of the Southern United States.
Sussex County is driven by agriculture and commercial fishing. Most of the land is rural and there are but a few large population centers. Many local restaurants serve southern cuisine such as sweet tea and dishes including or composed entirely of greens in addition to menus heavy with fried food.

Many dialectic studies show that Sussex County residents, much like surrounding Delmarva counties, have a variation of Southern American English which is particularly prevalent in rural areas.

===Festivals, fairs, and events===
Sussex County, Delaware is home to several festivals, fairs, and events.

<text>Mexico is a federal republic composed of 32 federative entities (): 31 states and Mexico City. According to the Constitution of Mexico, the states of the federation are free and sovereign in all matters concerning their internal affairs. Since 2016, Mexico City was made a fully autonomous entity on par with the states. Each state federative entity has its own congress and constitution.

== Overview ==
The current structural hierarchy of Mexican administrative divisions are outlined by Constitution of Mexico as well as the constitutions and laws of federative entities. The laws together established the following levels of administrative divisions. The levels in bold are those regulated by the federal constitution.

* State ()
** Region () and/or district () — only in some states
*** Municipality ()
**** City (), town (), village (), or others
***** Colonia () — only in some cities
* Mexico City ()
** Borough ()
*** Neighborhood ()

The Constitution of Mexico states the country constitutes 31 states (Article 43) and Mexico City (Article 44). As of March 2024, there are 2,460 municipalities under the 31 states, adding the 16 boroughs of Mexico City to constitute 2476 territorial units with local autonomy.

== Federative entities ==

There are currently 32 federative entities () of Mexico. In the Congress of the Union, the federative entities are each represented by three senators. Two are elected by universal suffrage on the principle of relative majority and one is assigned to the party that obtains the largest minority. In addition, the federation makes up a constituency in which 32 senators are elected by the method of proportional representation. These makes a total of 128 members of the Senate. Federal Deputies, however, do not represent the states, but rather the citizens themselves. The Chamber of Deputies and the Senate together comprise the Congress of the Union.

=== States ===


The states () of the Mexican Federation are free, sovereign, autonomous and independent of each other. They are free to govern themselves according to their own laws; each state has a constitution that cannot contradict the federal constitution, which covers issues of national competence. The states cannot make alliances with other states or any independent nation without the consent of the whole federation, except those related to defense and security arrangements necessary to keep the border states secure in the event of an invasion. 
The political organization of each state is based on a separation of powers in a congressional system: legislative power is vested in a unicameral congress (the federal congress has two chambers), executive power is independent of the legislature and vested in a governor elected by universal suffrage, and judicial power is vested in a Superior Court of Justice. Since the states have legal autonomy, each has its own civil and penal codes and judicial body.

=== Mexico City ===
Mexico City () is the capital of the United Mexican States. Before January 2016, the city was officially named the Federal District ().

Mexico City was separated from the State of Mexico, of which it was the capital, on November 18, 1824, to become the capital of the federation. As such, it belonged not to any state in particular but to all of them and to the federation. Therefore, the president of Mexico, who represented the federation, designated its head of government, previously referred to as the regent (&quot;regente&quot;) or head of department (&quot;jefe del departamento&quot;). However, the Federal District received more autonomy in 1997, and its citizens were then able to elect their chief of government for the first time.
In 2016, the Mexican Congress approved a constitutional reform eliminating the federal district and establishing Mexico City as a fully autonomous entity on par with the states. However, unlike the other states of the Union, it would receive funds for education and health. When full autonomy was granted, Mexico City adopted its own constitution (it previously had only an organic law, the Statute of Autonomy) and its boroughs expanded their local government powers.

=== Abbreviations and codes ===

== Subdivisions of federative entities ==
=== Regions and districts ===

The intrastate region () or district () are not constitutional administrative division levels. However, some states with higher numbers of municipalities establish such regions to support the administration.

Intrastate regions exist in the following 11 states:
* Chiapas groups its 124 municipalities into 15 economic regions.
* Guerrero groups its 81 municipalities into 7 economic regions.
* Hidalgo groups its 84 municipalities in 3 ways, into 26 micro regions, 14 operational regions, or 5 macro regions.
* Jalisco groups its 125 municipalities into 12 regions.
* México groups its 125 municipalities into 20 regions.
* Michoacán groups its 113 municipalities into 10 regions.
* Oaxaca groups its 570 municipalities into 30 districts, and then into 8 regions.
* San Luis Potosí groups its 58 municipalities into 4 regions.
* Tabasco groups its 17 municipalities in 2 ways, into 4 subregions, or 2 regions.
* Veracruz groups its 212 municipalities into 10 regions.
* Yucatán groups its 106 municipalities into 7 regions.

=== Municipalities and boroughs ===

According to the Constitution of Mexico, the states are internally divided into municipalities (), Mexico City is divided into boroughs (). The autonomy of municipalities and boroughs within federative entities are protected by the Constitution of Mexico.

Each municipality is autonomous in its ability to elect its own administration. A council is headed by a municipal president () who is elected every three years. Each municipality has a council () composed of councilors in terms of population size. In most cases, the council is responsible for providing all utilities required for its population. This concept, which arises from the Mexican Revolution, is known as a &quot;free municipality&quot;. 

The boroughs of Mexico City are colloquially known as &quot;alcaldías&quot; in Spanish, these boroughs kept the same territory and name as the former &quot;delegaciones&quot;. A borough is headed by a borough mayor () who is elected every three years.

As of March 2024, there are 2,460 municipalities in the 31 states of Mexico. The state with the highest number of municipalities is Oaxaca, with 570, and the state with the lowest number is Baja California Sur, with only five. There are 16 boroughs in Mexico City. These sums up to 2,476 division units.

=== Local settlements ===

The divisions of municipalities and boroughs are regulated solely by constitutions and laws of the respective federative entities. This level of divisions are collectively called localities () by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (, INEGI) of the federal government.

Among the states, settlement classification schemes vary. Common types of localities include:
* City () — for more populous places, see List of cities in Mexico,
* Town () — for middle populous places, and
* Village () — for less populous places.
Some larger cities are consolidated with its own municipality and form a single level governance. In some cases, cities are further divided into &quot;delegaciones&quot; or &quot;colonias&quot;.

Mexico City further divides its boroughs into neighborhoods ().

==History==
===Constitutional empire===

On September 27, 1821, after three centuries of Spanish rule, Mexico gained independence. The Treaty of Córdoba recognized part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain as an Independent Empire – &quot;monarchist, constitutional and moderate&quot;. The new country named itself the Mexican Empire. The morning after the Army of the Three Guarantees entered Mexico City on September 28, 1821, Agustín de Iturbide ordered the Supreme Provisional Governmental Junta (September 1821 – February 1822) to meet to elect a president of the Imperial Regency and to issue a declaration of independence for the new nation. Iturbide was elected president of the Regency, and that afternoon the members of the Regency and the Supreme Junta signed the Declaration.

A minority of the Constituent Congress, looking for stability, elected Agustín de Iturbide as emperor. On July 21, 1822, Iturbide was crowned Emperor of Mexico. However, the &quot;Constitutional Empire&quot; quickly demonstrated the incompatibility of its two main parts: the Emperor and the Constituent Congress. The deputies were imprisoned just for expressing their opinions, and eventually Iturbide decided to dissolve the Congress and instead establish a National Board.

The lack of a legitimate legislature, the illegitimacy of the Emperor, and the absence of real solutions to the nation&#x27;s problems increased revolutionary activity. Antonio López de Santa Anna proclaimed the Plan of Casa Mata, to which later joined Vicente Guerrero and Nicolás Bravo. Iturbide was forced to reestablish the Congress and, in a vain attempt to save the order and keep the situation favorable to his supporters, he abdicated the crown of the empire on March 19, 1823.

Congress nullified the designation of Iturbide and therefore the recognition of the abdication. It deemed the coronation of Iturbide to have been a logical mistake in consummation of Independence. The dissolution of the Empire was the first political realignment of independent Mexico.

===Federal republic===

After the fall of the Empire, a triumvirate called the Supreme Executive Power was created. The provisional government created the Federal Republic, and it was in effect from April 1, 1823, to October 10, 1824.

Unrest in the provinces was widespread. On May 21, 1823, The Founding Plan of the Federal Republic was enacted. Its sixth article stated, &quot;The component parts of the Republic are free, sovereign and independent States in that which touches internal administration and government&quot;. Most of the &quot;Free States&quot;, which were invited to form the Federal Republic, joined the Union, except for the five Central American provinces, the former Captaincy General of Guatemala, which formed their own Federal Republic.

On January 31, 1824, the decree to create a Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation was issued, which incorporated the basic structure of the Federal Republic. It was determined that the criteria for inviting states to the federation should be that they &quot;...not be so few that through expansion and wealth in a few years they be able to aspire to constitute themselves as independent nations, breaking the federal bond, nor so many that through lack of manpower and resources the system should come to be unworkable.&quot;

Between 1823 and 1824, some of the &quot;Free States&quot; created their own constitutions, and others had already installed a Constituent Congress. Special cases were those of Yucatán, which on December 23, 1823, decided to join the federation but as a Federated Republic, and Chiapas, which decided by referendum to join the federation on September 14, 1824.

On October 4, 1824, the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1824 was enacted. The constitution officially created the United Mexican States. The country was composed of 19 states and 4 federal territories. After the publication of the constitution, on November 18, the Federal District was created. On November 24, Tlaxcala, which had retained a special status since the colonial era, was incorporated as a territory.

On October 10, 1824, Guadalupe Victoria took office as the first President of Mexico.

===Centralist republic===

The political structure of the Republic was amended by a decree on October 3, 1835, when the centralist system was established.

The constituent states of the Republic lost their freedom, autonomy, independence, and sovereignty by being totally subordinated to the central government. However, the territorial division itself was the same, as the text of Article 8 of the Law determined: The national territory is divided into departments, on the basis of population, location and other leading circumstances: its number, extension and subdivisions, would be detailed by constitutional law.

The Seven Constitutional Laws () were promulgated on December 30, 1836. The 1st article confirmed the decree of the law October 3, 1835; the Republic would be divided into departments, these in districts and the districts in parties. The 2nd article posited that the division of the Republic into departments would be under a special law with constitutional character. On December 30, 1835, a transitory decree was added to the Seven Laws. The decree stated that the territory of Tlaxcala and the Federal District would become a part of the Department of Mexico. The territories of Alta and Baja California would form the department of the Californias. Coahuila y Tejas would be divided into two departments. Colima would form part of Michoacán, and Aguascalientes would be declared a department.

This period of political instability caused several conflicts between the central government and the entities of the country, and there were rebellions in several states:
* Yucatán, due to being a &quot;Federated Republic&quot;, declared itself independent in 1840 (officially in 1841). The República de Yucatán () rejoined Mexico in 1848.
* Texas declared its independence and declared war against the central government of Mexico. The Republic of Texas was created. Texas remained independent until 1845, when it joined the United States of America. From 1861 to 1865, Texas was part of the Confederate States of America. After the defeat of the Confederacy in the American Civil War (1861–65) and Reconstruction, Texas rejoined the United States of America in 1870.
* In 1840, the states of Nuevo León, Tamaulipas and Coahuila declared themselves independent from Mexico for just under 250 days; the República del Río Grande never consolidated because independent forces were defeated by the centralist forces.
* Tabasco declared its separation from Mexico in February 1841, in protest against centralism and the imposed sanctions by centralist president Anastasio Bustamante. It rejoined in December 1842.
On September 11, 1842, the region of Soconusco joined Mexico as part of the department of Chiapas.

===Restoration of the Republic and Second Empire===
The Federal Republic was restored by the interim president José Mariano Salas on August 22, 1846. The state of Guerrero was provisionally erected in 1849, on the condition that it be approved by the legislatures of the states of México, Puebla and Michoacán, whose territories would be affected.

On February 5, 1857, the Federal Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1857 was enacted. In 1864, however, after the French intervention, the conservative Mexicans restored the constitutional monarchy, known as the Second Mexican Empire, led by the emperor Maximilian of Habsburg and supported by the French army of Napoleon III. The Empire was deposed in 1867 by the republican forces of Benito Juárez and the Federal Republic was restored again under the Constitution of 1857.

The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States of 1917 was the result of the Mexican Revolution. The third Constitution of Mexico confirmed the federal system of government that is currently in effect.

==Notes==
* Some of these flags are used in states like Civil or Historic Flags (Yucatán, Hidalgo, Baja California, Michoacán) and are even more recognized by people as the official state flags assigned by President Ernesto Zedillo in 1999 and can be found waving in homes of the people. The others are proposed by citizen or groups to state legislatures, but have not yet been approved. Only two states in Mexico have changed the flags and have formalized their own, Jalisco and Tlaxcala.

<text>Elizabeth MacKintosh (25 July 1896 – 13 February 1952), known by the pen name Josephine Tey, was a Scottish author. Her novel &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;, a detective work investigating the death of the Princes in the Tower, was chosen by the Crime Writers&#x27; Association in 1990 as the greatest crime novel of all time. Her first play &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot;, written under another pseudonym, Gordon Daviot, starred John Gielgud in its successful West End run.

== Life and work ==
MacKintosh was born in Inverness, the oldest of three daughters of Colin MacKintosh, a fruiterer, and Josephine (&quot;née&quot; Horne). She attended Inverness Royal Academy and then, in 1914, Anstey Physical Training College in Erdington, a suburb of Birmingham. She taught physical training at various schools in England and Scotland and during her vacations worked at a convalescent home in Inverness as a Voluntary Aid Detachment nurse. A youthful romance ended with her soldier friend&#x27;s death in the Somme battles. In 1923, she returned to Inverness permanently to care for her invalid mother, and stayed after her mother&#x27;s death that year to keep house for her father.

The curriculum for &quot;physical training&quot; included much more than athletics. Tey used her school experience in &quot;Miss Pym Disposes&quot; when describing the subjects taught at the school, and the types of bruises and other injuries sustained by the pupils. When she graduated, Tey worked in a physiotherapy clinic in Leeds, then taught in schools, first in Nottinghamshire, then in Oban, where she was injured when a boom in the gymnasium fell on her face. Tey repurposed this incident as a method of murder in &quot;Miss Pym Disposes&quot;.

While caring for her father she began her career as a writer. Her first published work was in &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; in 1925, under the name Gordon Daviot. She continued publishing verse and short stories in &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;, &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; and the &quot;Literary Review&quot;.

Her first novel, &quot;Kif: An Unvarnished History&quot;, was well received at the time with good reviews, a sale to America, and a mention in &quot;The Observer&quot;″s list of Books of the Week. This work, inspired by a detachment of the 4th Cameron Highlanders, a Scottish Territorial battalion stationed at Inverness before the First World War and prominent in the city&#x27;s affairs, was an early indication of Tey&#x27;s lasting interest in military matters. Three months later, her first mystery novel, &quot;The Man in the Queue&quot;, was published by Benn, Methuen. It was awarded the Dutton Mystery Prize when published in America. This is the first appearance of her detective, Inspector Alan Grant. It would be some years before she wrote another mystery.

MacKintosh&#x27;s real ambition had been to write a play which would receive a run in London&#x27;s West End. Her play &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot; was produced in 1932 at the Arts Theatre, under the Daviot pseudonym. Its success was such that it transferred to the New Theatre (now the Noël Coward Theatre) in 1933, for a year-long run. The production made a household name of its young leading man and director, John Gielgud (who became MacKintosh&#x27;s life-long friend). (Tey writes of Inspector Alan Grant that &quot;he had in his youth seen &quot;Richard of Bordeaux&quot;; four times he had seen it&quot;.) She stated she was inspired by Gielgud&#x27;s performance in &quot;Hamlet&quot; and by the Royal Tournament. Two more of her plays were produced at the New Theatre, &quot;The Laughing Woman&quot; (1934) and &quot;Queen of Scots&quot; (1934, written in collaboration with Gielgud).

She wrote about a dozen one-act plays and another dozen full-length plays, many with biblical or historical themes, under the name of Gordon Daviot but none of these received notable success. How she chose the name of Gordon is unknown, but Daviot was the name of a scenic locale near Inverness where she had spent many happy holidays with her family. Only four of her plays were produced during her lifetime.

Her only non-fiction book, &quot;Claverhouse&quot;, was written as a vindication of John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee, whom she regarded as a libeled hero: &quot;It is strange that a man whose life was so simple in pattern and so forthright in spirit should have become a peg for every legend, bloody or brave, that belonged to his time.&quot;

MacKintosh&#x27;s best-known books were written under the name of Josephine Tey, which was the name of her Suffolk great-great grandmother.

In five of the mystery novels, all of which except the first she wrote under the name of Tey, the hero is Scotland Yard Inspector Alan Grant. (Grant appears in a sixth, &quot;The Franchise Affair&quot;, as a minor character.) The best known of these is &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot;, in which Grant, laid up in hospital, has friends research reference books and contemporary documents so that he can puzzle out the mystery of whether King Richard III of England murdered his nephews, the Princes in the Tower. 

&quot;The Franchise Affair&quot; also has an historical context: although set in the 1940s, it is based on the 18th-century case of Elizabeth Canning. &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; was the last of Tey&#x27;s books published during her lifetime. Her last work, a further crime novel, &quot;The Singing Sands&quot;, was found in her papers and published posthumously.

== Death ==
Tey was intensely private, shunning all publicity throughout her life. During her last year, when she knew that she was terminally ill, she resolutely avoided all her friends as well. Her ultimate work, &quot;The Privateer&quot; (1952), was a romantic novel based on the life of the privateer Henry Morgan. She died of liver cancer at her sister Mary&#x27;s home in London on 13 February 1952. Most of her friends, including Gielgud, were unaware that she was even ill. Her obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; appeared under her real name: &quot;Miss E. Mackintosh Author of &#x27;Richard of Bordeaux&#x27;&quot;.

Proceeds from Tey&#x27;s estate, including royalties from her books, were assigned to the National Trust.

== Reception and legacy ==
In 1990, &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; was selected by the Crime Writers&#x27; Association as the greatest crime novel of all time; &quot;The Franchise Affair&quot; was 11th on the same list of 100 books.

In 2015, Val McDermid argued that Tey &quot;cracked open the door&quot; for later writers such as Patricia Highsmith and Ruth Rendell to explore the darker side of humanity, creating a bridge between the Golden Age of Detective Fiction and contemporary crime novels, because &quot;Tey opened up the possibility of unconventional secrets. Homosexual desire, cross-dressing, sexual perversion – they were all hinted at, glimpsed in the shadows as a door closed or a curtain twitched. Tey was never vulgar nor titillating... Nevertheless, her world revealed a different set of psychological motivations.&quot; In 2019, Evie Jeffrey discussed Tey&#x27;s engagement with capital punishment debates in &quot;A Shilling for Candles&quot; and &quot;To Love and Be Wise&quot;.
