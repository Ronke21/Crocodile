<text>Bethnal Green is an area in London, England, and is located in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It is in east London and part of the East End. The area emerged from the small settlement which developed around the Green, much of which survives today as Bethnal Green Gardens, beside Cambridge Heath Road. By the 16th century the term applied to a wider rural area, the &quot;Hamlet of Bethnal Green&quot;, which subsequently became a Parish, then a Metropolitan Borough before merging with neighbouring areas to become the north-western part of the new Tower Hamlets.

Economic focus shifted from mainstream farming produce for the City of London – through highly perishable goods production (market gardening), weaving, dock and building work and light industry – to a high proportion of commuters to city businesses, public sector/care sector roles, construction, courier businesses and home-working digital and creative industries. Identifiable slums in the maps of Booth in &quot;Life and Labour of the People in London&quot; (3 editions, 1889–1903) were in large part cleared before the aerial bombardment of the Second World War which accelerated clearance of many tightly packed terraces of small houses to be replaced with green spaces and higher-rise social housing.

==Toponymy==
The topographer Daniel Lysons suggested in the late 18th century that Bethnal was a corruption of &quot;Bathon Hall&quot; which would have been the residence of a notable Bathon family who owned large parts of Stepney, the parish of which Bethnal Green was part. &quot;Green&quot; related to one which lay &quot;about half a mile beyond the suburbs&quot;.

More recently it has been suggested that the name could be a derivation of the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Blithehale&quot; or &quot;Blythenhale&quot; from the 13th century. &quot;healh&quot; would have meant &quot;angle, nook, or corner&quot; and &quot;blithe&quot; would have been the word for &quot;happy, blithe&quot;, or come from a personal name &quot;Blitha&quot;. In either case, the &quot;Dictionary of London Place Names&quot; supports a contraction involving &quot;hall&quot; or &quot;healh&quot;, noting h-dropping in local dialects, to &quot;Bethnal Green&quot;.

==History==
===Origins and administration===

The term &quot;Bethnal Green&quot; originally referred to a small common in the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney; around which a small settlement developed. By the seventeenth century the area had become a &quot;hamlet&quot;, a territorial sub-division of Stepney, with a degree of independence. Continued housebuilding and population growth in the 18th century led to the hamlet area becoming a fully independent daughter parish in 1743. The parish had a church, a benefice (for its priest) and vestry (for its people) in 1743. 
In 1855 Bethnal Green was included within the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works to which it nominated one member and the various local government bodies were replaced by a single incorporated vestry which consisted of 48 elected vestrymen.

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855, any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the incorporated vestry of St Matthew Bethnal Green was divided into four wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or East (9), No. 2 or North (9), No. 3 or West (15) and No. 4 or South (15).

The (civil) parish became a Metropolitan Borough in 1900, which merged with some of the neighbouring areas, to become the new London Borough of Tower Hamlets, in 1965.

The area was part of the historic (or ancient) county of Middlesex, but military and most (or all) civil county functions were managed more locally, by the Tower Division (also known as the Tower Hamlets).

The role of the &quot;Tower Division&quot; ended when Bethnal Green became part of the new County of London in 1889. The County of London was replaced by Greater London in 1965.


===Early history===

In what would become northern Bethnal Green (known as Cambridge Heath) a tract of common land, which stretched to the east and west, a part of the Manor and Ancient Parish of Stepney. The heath was used as pasture where people grazed their sheep in the 13th century, though 1275 records suggest at least one house stood there. Stepney&#x27;s Manor House (known as &quot;Bishopswood&quot;, later &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Hall&quot;) was located in Bethnal Green from at least 1207, on a site subsequently occupied by the London Chest Hospital.

===Emblems===
====Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green====
The area was once best known for the popular early modern ballad, &quot;The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green&quot;, which tells the story of a beautiful young woman named Bess, the daughter of a blind beggar. The earliest known explicit mention of the ballad is from 1624, but it was clearly well established by that date, as two other ballads of similar date were said to have been sung to the tune of the &quot;Blind Beggar&quot;. A play on the same theme, almost certainly based on an existing ballad, is known to have been performed in 1600.

According to one version of the legend, found in Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&quot; published in 1765, the beggar was said to be Henry, the son of Simon de Montfort, but Percy himself declared that this version was not genuine. A version published in 1934, closely based on Percy&#x27;s but with some amendments to include much older material, contains 67 verses. The ballad recounts how Bess leaves Bethnal Green to seek her fortune, and stays a short time at the Queen&#x27;s Arms inn at Romford. There, her beauty quickly attracts four suitors, three of whom lose interest when she declares her background, while the fourth, a knight is unconcerned by her father&#x27;s status. The couple marry, and despite his seeming poverty, the beggar gives a huge dowry to the knight, to the bitter dismay of the other three suitors. The Blind Beggar public house, just on the Bethnal Green side of the historic boundary with Whitechapel, is reputed to be the site of his begging.

A depiction of the beggar is known to have been used on the head of the local beadle&#x27;s staff in 1690. Later, the beggar and his daughter were the basis of the common seal of the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green. The legend also inspired Elisabeth Frink&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Blind Beggar and his Dog&quot; (1958) on the Cranbrook Estate in Bethnal Green.

====Mulberry====
Bethnal Green is famous for its mulberry trees, most notably the Bethnal Green mulberry at the site of the former London Chest Hospital, which is reputed to be the oldest tree in the East End. Many of these mulberry trees may be a legacy of unsuccessful 16th and 17th century attempts to boost the weaving industries that Bethnal Green, Shoreditch, Spitalfields and other East End districts relied upon so heavily.

Mulberries were used as the local emblem when it was a partly self-governing neighbourhood of Tower Hamlets from 1986 to 1992, and the symbol can still be seen on many local street signs. The mulberry is also used as a symbol of the East End more generally, and is featured on the coat of arms of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

===Growth===

The Green and Poor&#x27;s Land is the area of open land now occupied by Bethnal Green Library, the Young V&amp;A and St John&#x27;s Church, designed by John Soane.

In John Stow&#x27;s &quot;Survey of London&quot; (1598) the hamlet was called &quot;Blethenal Green&quot;. It was one of the hamlets included in the Manor of Stepney and Hackney. Hackney later became separated.

In 1678, the owners of houses surrounding the Green purchased the land to save it from being built on and in 1690, the land was conveyed to a trust under which it was to be kept open and rent from it used for the benefit of poor people living in the vicinity. From that date, the trust has administered the land and its minute books are kept in the London Metropolitan Archives.

Bethnal House, or Kirby&#x27;s Castle, was the principal house on the Green. One of its owners was Sir Hugh Platt (1552–1608), author of books on gardening and practical science. Under its next owner it was visited by Samuel Pepys. In 1727 it was leased to Matthew Wright and for almost two centuries it was an asylum. Its two most distinguished inmates were Alexander Cruden, compiler of the &quot;Concordance to the Bible&quot;, and the poet Christopher Smart. Cruden recorded his experience in &quot;The London Citizen Grievously Injured&quot; (1739) and Smart&#x27;s stay there is recorded by his daughter. Records of the asylum are kept in the annual reports of the Commissioner in Lunacy. Even today, the park where the library stands is known locally as &quot;Barmy Park&quot;.

The original mansion, the White House, was supplemented by other buildings. In 1891, the Trust lost the use of Poor&#x27;s Land to the London County Council. The asylum reorganised its buildings, demolishing the historic White House and erecting a new block in 1896. This building became the present Bethnal Green Library. A history of Poor&#x27;s Land and Bethnal House is included in &quot;The Green&quot;, written by A.J. Robinson and D.H.B. Chesshyre.

Boxing has a long association with Bethnal Green. Daniel Mendoza, who was champion of England from 1792 to 1795 though born in Aldgate, lived in Paradise Row on the western side of Bethnal Green for 30 years. Joe Anderson, &#x27;All England&#x27; champion of 1897, was from Bethnal Green.

The north end of the Green is associated with the Natt family. During the 18th century they owned many of its houses. Netteswell House is the residence of the curator of the Bethnal Green Museum. It is almost certainly named after the village of Netteswell, near Harlow, whose rector was the Reverend Anthony Natt. A few of its houses have become University settlements. In Victoria Park Square, on the east side of the Green, No. 18 has a Tudor well in its cellar.

The silk-weaving trade spread eastwards from Spitalfields throughout the 18th century. This attracted many Huguenot and Irish weavers to the district. Large estates of small two-storey cottages were developed in the west of the area to house them. A downturn in the trade in 1769 led to the Spitalfield Riots, and on 6 December 1769, two weavers accused of &quot;cutting&quot; were hanged in front of the Salmon and Ball public house.

Bethnal Green Road Market on the road of the same name, founded in the 18th century, grew and grew and became more full with stalls. By 1959 stalls were choking the streets and the council attempted to relocate the market but had no success. In 1986 there had been many shop closures but the stalls were still trading. The street market is now today recognised as a major local shopping area.

===Victorian era===
In the 19th century, Bethnal Green remained characterised by its market gardens and by weaving. Having been an area of large houses and gardens as late as the 18th century, by about 1860 Bethnal Green was mainly full of tumbledown old buildings with many families living in each house. By the end of the century, Bethnal Green was one of the poorest slums in London. Jack the Ripper operated at the western end of Bethnal Green and in neighbouring Whitechapel. In 1900, the Old Nichol Street rookery was replaced with the Boundary Estate (near the limits of Shoreditch). This was a first in council housing. Brothers Lew Grade and Bernard Delfont were brought up on the estate. In 1909, the larger Bethnal Green Estate was opened with money left by the philanthropist William Richard Sutton which he left for &quot;modern dwellings and houses for occupation by the poor of London and other towns and populous places in England&quot;. The Peabody Trust administered the funds to complete much of the estate in 1910.

The Regent&#x27;s Canal opened in 1820, for horse-drawn canal barges to carry cargo between the London Docklands and the Grand Union Canal. These supplied local coal merchants and gas houses/plants (gasifiers) built along its banks including Bethnal Green.

The London Society for Promoting Christianity among the Jews built Palestine Place as Cambridge Heath began to be fully developed during the first half of the 19th century. A windmill survived until at least 1836. Most local residents were poor, especially in the streets around the railway line and the Regent&#x27;s Canal, as well as on Russia Lane.

As the population grew, a number of mission churches were founded to serve newly created parishes. St Andrew&#x27;s church on Viaduct Street was built in 1841, serving a congregation of up to 350 people. It closed and was demolished in 1958. St Barnabas Church on Grove Road, opposite Mile End Park, was founded in 1870 and still operates today. 

In 1841, the Anglo-Catholic Nathaniel Woodard, who was to become a highly influential educationalist in the later part of the 19th century, became the curate of the newly created St. Bartholomew&#x27;s church on Buckhurst Street. He was a capable pastoral visitor and established a parochial school. In 1843, he got into trouble for preaching a sermon in which he argued that &quot;The Book of Common Prayer&quot; should have additional material to provide for confession and absolution and in which he criticised the &quot;inefficient and Godless clergy&quot; of the Church of England. After examining the text of the sermon, the Bishop of London condemned it as containing &quot;erroneous and dangerous notions&quot;. As a result, the bishop sent Woodard to be a curate in Clapton. St Bartholomew&#x27;s church continued operating until 1983 and is now converted for residential use. 

Globe Town was established from 1800 to provide for the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, operating 20,000 looms in their own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms became idle and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.

Columbia Road Flower Market is on the street of the same name which has kept some Victorian shops, and was established as Columbia Market in 1869 as a covered food market. It closed in 1886, but was later revived as a Sunday flower market.

Bethnal Green Junction, now just Bethnal Green from 1946 (which leads to confusion with the much-later London Underground station) and Cambridge Heath railway station are on the London Overground. Both were opened by the Great Eastern Railway (GER) on the Lea Valley Lines in 1872 as part of a more direct route to Enfield Town. The GER opened further Fast Lines that allow longer-distance trains to bypass these. Bethnal Green was also formerly served by trains on the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML) via and saw two derailments in the later 20th century, similar to other contemporary comparators of busy, metropolitan junctions.

Mowlem Street School opened in 1887. It was enlarged in 1898 and again in 1902 to accommodate 410 boys and 410 girls. A new single-storey building catering for 280 children was opened in 1971 when it was renamed Mowlem Primary School.

===Early 20th century===
Bethnal Green Town Hall was completed in 1910 and the internationally renowned York Hall opened in 1929 with a capacity of 1,200. In 1993, the Town Hall was vacated when the London Borough of Tower Hamlets moved its headquarters, and in 2007 the building was converted to a hotel which opened in 2010.

The warehouse buildings rose from the Regent&#x27;s Canal without a towpath to interrupt development, giving direct access to the canal. A row of Victorian workshops was built on Wadeson Street in what was a historically Jewish precinct. This became very overcrowded with 572 inhabitants living in 125 houses by the 1930s.

===Second World War===
====The Blitz====
During the Second World War, the Luftwaffe began The Blitz on 7 September 1940. Bethnal Green was in &quot;Target Area A&quot; along with the rest of the East End of London.

Bethnal Green Library was bombed on the very first night of the Blitz. This forced the temporary relocation of the library into the unopened Bethnal Green Underground Station in order to provide continuity of lending services. The library was rebuilt and opened a few months later for the public. Oxford House also had a major role, with some local residents fleeing into the house off Bethnal Green Road seeking shelter, this location was more attractive than the stables under the nearby Great Eastern Main Line arches. The Chief Shelter Welfare Officer at the time, Jane Leverson, is reported to have said that &quot;people came to Oxford House not because it was an air raid shelter but because there they found happiness and a true spirit of fellowship&quot;.

It is estimated that during this war, 80 tons of bombs fell on the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green, affecting 21,700 houses, destroying 2,233 and making a further 893 uninhabitable. There were a total of 555 people killed and 400 seriously injured. Many unexploded bombs remain in the area, and on 14 May 2007, builders discovered a Second World War 1 m long bomb.

====Bethnal Green tube disaster====
On 3 March 1943, the air-raid civil defence siren sounded at 8:17 pm, causing a flow of people down the narrow staircase, with no handrail, of the uncompleted Bethnal Green tube station, wet from rain and only dimly lit due to blackout precautions, to shelter from bombs. (The station had been requisitioned in 1940 by the Metropolitan Borough of Bethnal Green under the supervision of the Regional Commissioners.) A crowd crush ensued, thought to have been triggered by a woman carrying a baby tripping on the stairs. A new anti-aircraft rocket being test-fired in nearby Victoria Park caused panic, being thought to be a German weapon. The panic began at 8:27.

In the wet, dark conditions, a woman tripped on the crowded stairs, causing many others to fall. Within a few seconds 300 people were crushed in the narrow stairwell, causing the deaths of 173 people, mostly women and 62 children, who were crushed and asphyxiated. A report was filed by Eric Linden, who witnessed the incident, with the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, but not published. Very little information was provided at the time. The outcome of a government inquiry was not made public until 1946 to avoid a propaganda win for the enemy and to protect public morale. It was the largest loss of life in a single incident on the London Underground network.

Director Steve McQueen made a 2024 film, &quot;Blitz&quot;, about the wartime bombing of London (the Blitz), depicting and partly inspired by this event.

===Post-war===

Bethnal Green tube station opened on 4 December 1946 on the Central line and is between Liverpool Street and Mile End on the London Underground, however construction of the Central line&#x27;s eastern extension into then-Essex was started in the 1930s, and the tunnels were largely complete at the outbreak of the Second World War although rails were not laid.

The book &quot;Family and Kinship in East London&quot; (1957) shows an improvement in working class life. Husbands in the sample population no longer went out to drink but spent time with the family. As a result, both birth rate and infant death rate fell drastically and local prosperity increased.

The famous criminals, the Kray twins, lived and operated in the area during the 1950s and 1960s, with a gang known as The Firm.


In 2015, three children Amira Abase, Shamima Begum, and Kadiza Sultana appeared in the press, referred to as the Bethnal Green trio. All three had attended the Bethnal Green Academy before leaving home to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).

==Representation==

Excluding the five-year tenure of George Galloway at Westminster from 2005, for any seat containing the name Bethnal Green: the pre-1945 General Election decades of Bethnal Green South West was the last time when such a seat was not won by the chosen Labour Party candidate.

Bethnal Green forms part of the UK Parliament constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow. Its MP since 2010 has been Rushanara Ali of the Labour Party.

London overall has a directly elected executive Mayor of London, currently Sadiq Khan, and the City and East seat in the London Assembly is held by the Labour Party member, Unmesh Desai.

The area of Bethnal Green covers roughly three wards of Tower Hamlets; Bethnal Green represented by Councillors Mohammed Ahbab Hossain, Sirajul Islam (who is Statutory Deputy Mayor for Housing under Mayor of Tower Hamlets and Eve McQuillan; St Peter&#x27;s (which takes its name from the ecclesiastical parish of the same name) represented by Councillors Kevin Brady, Tarik Khan and Gabriella Salva-Macallan; and Weaver&#x27;s represented by Councillors John Pierce and Abdul Mukit All local councillors are currently members of the Labour Party.

Between 1986 and 1992, the name &quot;Bethnal Green&quot; was applied to one of seven neighbourhoods to which power was devolved from the council. Much of the street signage in the area was replaced to reflect this.

==Cityscape==
===Conservation Areas===
Bethnal Green has a number of conservation areas established by Tower Hamlets Council due to its history and landscape, including the Bethnal Green Gardens Conservation Area which was designated in July 1969 and then extended in October 2008 to the south west of the tube station due to significant buildings located in and around the junction of Bethnal Green Road, Roman Road and Cambridge Heath Road, which helps ensure these landmarks will be preserved.

A part of the Hackney Road Conservation Area is intended to protect the special architectural and historic character of buildings and areas adjoining the road which are composed of a dense concentration of modest sized properties. The Victoria Park Conservation Area was designated in March 1977, altered in 2008 to make way for the Regent&#x27;s Canal Conservation Area and to expand Driffield Road Conservation Area and now includes the listed park itself, the formal axial road pattern to the south west and the many Victorian terraces.

It is also part of the wider Regents Canal Conservation Area, the streetside buildings are neglected but form part of the industrial heritage and character of Vyner Street and also Wadeson Street, which contains a row of three storey Victorian workshops mostly converted to residential use. Both types contribute to the character of the area.

To the north-west is the Old Bethnal Green Road Conservation Area, which focuses around the roads of the Winkley Estate, which has a very cohesive character and little scope exists for change. The buildings contained within the area being considered form an important group worthy of protection and enhancement.

===Parks===
Bethnal Green Gardens, located in central Bethnal Green, holds the war memorial, known as the Stairway To Heaven, and Weavers&#x27; Fields, which is a 15.6 acres park and is the 6th largest open space in Tower Hamlets that lies south of Bethnal Green Road. The western part of Victoria Park is in Bethnal Green.

In the 1970s, Tower Hamlets Council decided to fence and lock up the area now known as &quot;Bethnal Green Nature Reserve&quot;, to protect it from fly tipping. In the late 1990s the local &quot;Teesdale and Hollybush Tenants and Residents Association&quot; became the site custodians and, with the support of Tower Hamlets Council, took responsibility for St Jude&#x27;s as it was still called locally.

===Notable buildings===
The former &quot;Bethnal Green Infirmary&quot;, later the &quot;London County Council Bethnal Green Hospital,&quot; stood opposite Cambridge Heath railway station. The hospital closed as a public hospital in the 1970s and was a geriatric hospital under the NHS until the 1980s. Much of the site was developed for housing in the 1990s but the hospital entrance and administration block remains as a listed building.

==Demographics==
Bethnal Green had a total population of 27,849 at the 2011 UK census. The largest single ethnic group is people of Bangladeshi descent, who constitute 38 per cent of the area&#x27;s population. Every year since 1999 the Baishakhi Mela is held in Weavers&#x27; Fields to commemorate the Bengali New Year. The second largest is the White British, constituting 30 per cent of the area&#x27;s population. Other ethnic groups include Black Africans and Black Caribbeans.

According to the UK census of 2011, the population has a lower proportion of young people than the national average and a higher proportion of older people. Bethnal Green also has a significant immigrant population.

==Religion and mysticism==

In 2021 the religions of Bethnal Green&#x27;s residents were estimated at:
* Christian: 4,394 (22.33)
* Muslim: 8,418 (42.78%)
* Hindu: 309 (1.57%)
* Sikh: 85 (0.43%)
* Buddhist: 230 (1.17%)
* Jewish: 82 (0.42%)
* Other: 106 (0.54%)
* No religion: 6,052 (30.76%)

There are many historic churches in Bethnal Green. Notable Church of England churches include St John on Bethnal Green, which was built from 1826 to 1828 by the architect John Soane, St Matthew – built by George Dance the Elder in 1746. St Matthew is the mother church of Bethnal Green; the church&#x27;s opening coincided with a vast population increase in the former village of Stepney, resulting in the need to separate the area around Bethnal Green from the mother Parish of St Dunstan&#x27;s, Stepney. All but the bell tower, still standing today, was destroyed by fire and the church again suffered devastating damage during the bombing campaigns of the Second World War, resulting in the installation of a temporary church within the bombed-out building. St. Matthew&#x27;s remains a major beacon of the local East End community and is frequented on Sundays and other religious occasions by a mixture of established locals and more recent migrants to the area. Other churches include St Peter&#x27;s (1841) and St James-the-Less (1842), both by Lewis Vulliamy, St James the Great by Edward Blore (1843) and St Bartholomew by William Railton (1844). The church attendance in Bethnal Green was 1 in 8 people since 1900 (only 10% attend regularly in the UK). Baptisms, marriages and burials have been deposited nearly at all churches in Bethnal Green.

There is one major Roman Catholic church, the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, in Bethnal Green. The Church of Our Lady of the Assumption hosts the London Chinese Catholic Centre and Chinese mass is held weekly. Other Christian churches include The Good Shepherd Mission, The Bethnal Green Medical Mission, The Bethnal Green Methodist Church. The Quakers hold regular meetings in Old Ford Road. Opened and named after the parish of Bethnal Green, in 1868, the Bethnal Green Methodist Church became tied in with the founding of the National Children&#x27;s Home and Orphanage (now Action for Children). This was established next to the church on Bonner Road.

St. Casimir&#x27;s Lithuanian Church serves London&#x27;s Lithuanian community and masses are held in both Lithuanian and English.

There are at least eight mosques or places of worship in Bethnal Green for the Muslim community. These include the Baitul Aman Mosque and Cultural Centre, Darul Hadis Latifiah, the Senegambian Islamic Cultural Centre and the Globe Town Mosque and Cultural Centre.

The London Buddhist Centre works with those affected by alcohol dependency, the centre also runs courses and retreats using mindfulness based cognitive therapy approaches. Its courses for depression, based on the mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral therapy methodology of Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, featured in the Financial Times in 2008. It is the focus of a large Buddhist residential and business community in the area.

In the Boundary Estate, Arnold Circus is a mark point on several ley line alignments, such as for example the Alfred Watkins&#x27; &quot;Strand Ley&quot; and &quot;The Coronation Line&quot;.

==Public services==
===Health===
The Bethnal Green and Globe Town Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) is a community-based multidisciplinary team; they provide a health and social care for service users with severe and enduring mental health problems, run by East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT).

===Education===
Bethnal Green has numerous primary schools, educating children aged four to 11. St. Matthias School, on Bacon Street off Brick Lane, is over a century old and uses the Seal of the old Metropolitan Borough as its badge and emblem. The school was opened with funds from 18th-century St. Matthew&#x27;s Church on St. Matthew&#x27;s Row. The Bangabandhu Primary School, named after Sheikh Mujib (who had declared the independence of Bangladesh), a non-selective state community school, was opened in January 1989; it moved to a new building in November 1991 and has over 450 pupils. In the first decade, around 70% of pupils&#x27; parents spoke Sylheti, a dialect of Bengali, at home, and English as a second language; Standard Bengali was a subject choice in the school.

Bethnal Green Academy is one of the top schools and sixth form colleges in London. Other schools in the area include Oaklands School.

The oldest secondary school was Raine&#x27;s Foundation School on Old Bethnal Green, a voluntary aided, Anglican-tradition, state school founded in 1719. The school relocated, amalgamating with St. Jude&#x27;s School to become coeducational in 1977. The school closed in 2020.

Bethnal Green Gardens and Bethnal Green Library provide leisure facilities and information.

===Voluntary and community services===
The Oxford House is a proactive community centre that has its roots in helping the local community. Founded in 1884, as one of the first &quot;settlements&quot; by Oxford University, it has helped alleviate or remove the impact of poverty and today provides a programme of community classes, events and weekly activities.

The Approach Gardens, once an unused space, has been developed into a community food garden, a shared fruit orchard and a wildlife area.

The Nomadic Community Gardens, once an area fenced off and overgrown, was occupied between 2015 and 2019 by a temporary project or &quot;meanwhile use&quot; run by a private limited company on behalf of the property developer Londonewcastle, which leases the site to the garden operator for a peppercorn rent and provided start-up funding. Londonewcastle gained planning consent for a development of &quot;affordable housing, townhouses and apartments&quot; on the site in November 2015. Construction on the Fleet Street Hill Project was intended to commence in 2016. In 2019 ownership of the lease was sold and the site remained empty.

The Gallery Cafe, in St. Margaret&#x27;s House, reopened as a vegetarian not-for-profit, community café in 2006; it became a fully vegan café in December 2017. It won &quot;Best Café in Bethnal Green&quot; at the Time Out &quot;Love London Awards&quot; in 2014, 2015 and 2016.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Bethnal Green tube station is on the London Underground Central line, which connects Bethnal Green directly to Stratford in the east, the City and London&#x27;s West End.

The area is also linked to the National Rail network at two stations on the London Overground network: Bethnal Green and Cambridge Heath railway stations.

In 2018, Cambridge Heath station was chosen for a trial with a pay-by-face system that may end the need for station barriers, due to its low passenger volumes and having no gates.

Bethnal Green has also been part of the Night Tube service since 2016.

===Buses===
Bethnal Green is served by London Buses, including route 8, 26, 55, 254 and 388 to Central London; routes 309, 388, D3, D6 and night routes N8, N26, N55 and N243 also stop here.

The 26 bus route was introduced in 1992 to replace the withdrawn section of route 6 between Hackney Wick and Aldwych and included a new night counterpart to Chingford from Hackney Wick, the N26.

On 25 September 1993, route 309 started running between Bethnal Green and Poplar. It was intended to start from the London Chest Hospital but this was delayed due to speed hump problems and it therefore started and ended at Three Colts Lane instead. It was finally extended from Bethnal Green station to Chest Hospital in 1995.

==Art and memorials==
Clare Street is well known as an art quarter. Some of the murals there have the buildings&#x27; owners&#x27; permission. Elsewhere, a mural of David Attenborough appeared on the side of a tropical fish store on St Matthew&#x27;s Row.

Chris Gollon gained a major commission from the Church of England for fourteen Stations of the Cross paintings for the St John church. Gollon was a controversial choice, since he was not a practising Christian. In order to carry out the commission, and for consultation on theological matters, he collaborated with Fr Alan Green, Rector of the church.

Between 2005 and 2008, the EEL (East End Life) established the Vyner Street Festival with the local Victory Pub as a family festival with local bands, artists and market traders, this has a different theme every year, with the Red Arrows performing flyover in 2008. By 2012, however, many artists had moved out due to the effects of the Great Recession as well as the 2012 Olympics. A documentary film was released in the same year titled &quot;Vyner Street&quot;: this was a short observational piece about two different worlds living inconspicuously and side by side in the same place.

As part of &quot;TUBE&quot; Art Installation in November 2013, sound artist Kim Zip created an installation commemorating the Bethnal Green Tube Disaster. The work was backed by the Whitechapel Gallery and promoted as part of the organisation&#x27;s &quot;First Thursdays&quot; initiative for popular art. &quot;TUBE&quot; exhibited over a period of four weeks in the belfry of Sir John Soane&#x27;s St John on Bethnal Green Church. The Lady Dinah&#x27;s Cat Emporium was the first cat café in London, which was opened in 2013.

The Oval Space hosted &quot;Catfest&quot; in 2018, with guests having the chance to take photos with cats as well as sample street food and meet shelter kittens.

A plaque was placed at the entrance to the tube station in the 1970s to commemorate the disaster there, one of the worst of the Second World War; and a larger memorial, &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, stands in nearby Bethnal Green Gardens. This memorial was unveiled in December 2017 at a ceremony attended by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Bethnal Green and Bow MP Rushanara Ali.

==Employment and gentrification==
In 2019 Sustrans opened a new London headquarters at Bethnal Green.

Early in 2018 Frank Wang, who had sold coffee to commuters from his van at the northern exit of Bethnal Green underground station lost his business when the electricity supply from the station was cut off as a result of the nearby site of a disused public lavatory behind his stall being converted into a beach bar called Chiringuito. Tower Hamlets Mayor John Biggs, one of Frank&#x27;s long-standing customers came out in support along with the local community, the Chinese community and commuters who protested.

Formerly part of the estate of Truman&#x27;s Brewery, now a free house, the Hare was cited as the epitome of a &#x27;good, honest pub&#x27; by the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and was listed as one of the 50 best pubs in London in 2019. During the May bank holiday, the redeveloped railway arches off Cambridge Heath Road into an eating and drinking quarter opened. Tower Hamlets Council had turned down plans for the Cambridge Heath Road development because of concerns over its affordable housing mix and design quality. The Better Streets for Tower Hamlets had turned the car park spot in Bethnal Green Road into a mini park for a day to draw people&#x27;s attention to the need for more healthier public spaces.

In 2018 Sainsbury&#x27;s opened what it claims was the country&#x27;s first meat-free butchers, in the form of a traditional style butchers which was open for three days from Friday 21 June to mark World Meat Free Week, where it offered customers an array of cuts and joints derived from plant-based alternatives, such as mushroom, jackfruit and pea protein. During the 2019 redecorating of the Carpenters Arms on Cheshire Street, an old safe was found in the cellar when a wall was torn down. It is thought it was boarded up before the immediately previous owners has acquired the pub.

<text>Bexleyheath is a town in south-east London, England, in the London Borough of Bexley. It had a population of approximately 15,600 in 2021 and is southeast of Charing Cross. It is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in London. Its post town takes in other surrounding neighbourhoods, including Barnehurst, West Heath and Upton.

== History==
For most of its history, Bexley heath was heath land. The Romans built a road through the heath, Watling Street, which connected Londinium (London) to Dubris (Dover). This Roman road still marks the spine of Bexley new town.

===Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries===
In the early 19th century, Bexley heath was a broad rough pasture and scrubland with few buildings. Its windmill stood to the north east, where Erith and Mayplace Roads now meet. In 1766 Sir John Boyd had Danson House built in his enclosed land (&quot;park&quot;). The core of this remains as Danson Park between the southern halves of Bexleyheath and Welling. In 1814 most of the rest of what was Bexley heath, north of Bexley, became enclosed (privatised) with a fund of money given in compensation to trustees for the poor of the parish.

In 1859 architect Philip Webb designed Red House for artist, reforming designer and socialist William Morris on the western edge of the heath, in the hamlet of Upton—before Upton became a suburb. The National Trust acquired the house in 2003. Morris wanted to have a &quot;Palace of Art&quot; in which he and his friends could enjoy producing works of art. The house is of red brick with a steep tiled roof and an emphasis on natural materials. It is in a brick-and-tile style to resemble cumulative generational additions. Its layout and geometrics are non-uniform and it is recognised and protected with highest category (Grade I) listed building status as it is avant-garde to influential Arts and Crafts architecture. Morris lived with wife Jane in the house for five years, during which time their two daughters, Jenny and May, were born. Needing to sell the house in 1865 to economise, Morris vowed never to return to it; he said that to see the house again would be more than he could bear.

Bexleyheath&#x27;s parish church, Christ Church, dates from 1841; and the ecclesiastical parish from 1866; the building of the current church finished in 1877. Alfred Bean, railway engineer and one-time owner of Danson House, furthered the development of Bexleyheath as a London suburb by championing the Bexleyheath Line in the 1880s to support the growth of estates around Danson Park.

===Twentieth century===
The clock tower at the centre of the modern shopping area, built in 1912, commemorates the coronation of King George V and the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II in 2012 when a bust of the Queen was installed.

The area was part of the historic county of Kent until the creation of Greater London in 1965, at which point Bexleyheath became the administrative base of the newly established London Borough of Bexley. The town centre shops and road layout were redeveloped in the 1980s and 1990s. The latter decade saw the pedestrianisation of the road adjacent to the shopping centre having built two minor bypass roads, Arnsburg Way and Albion Way.

== Demographics ==
According to the 2021 census from the ONS, Bexleyheath has a population of roughly 15,600, 21.8% of which are aged 65+, above the borough average of 16.5%. The largest ethnic group is White at 78.2%, higher than the borough average of 71.9%, with the second largest being Asian/Asian British at 10.7%. The largest religious group is Christianity at 49.7% of the population, followed by No religion at 33.8%, roughly the same as the borough average.

== Town centre ==
The vast majority of restaurants and eateries are on Broadway. The south side of the central, pedestrianised section of Broadway hosts Broadway Shopping Centre, a covered example completed in 1984, and a substantial supermarket four years later, as in other urban places including New Towns. A cinema stands to the east facing a medium-sized supermarket.

A renovation in 2008 on &quot;The Mall&quot; gave the centre a more modern interior. The appending of &quot;Bexleyheath Square&quot; took place in the early 2000s, more retail units. Much of this investment provides local competition to Bluewater Shopping Centre, east in Greenhithe, Kent.

The statue outside the Broadway Centre is &quot;Family Outing&quot; by local artist John Ravera; it was commissioned by Norwich Union and unveiled in 1985.

In May 2009 a major redevelopment scheme was approved by the local council following public consultation. This involved the redevelopment of the Bexley council buildings. The magistrates&#x27; court was to move to a new building where the library stands, which would be incorporated into the new development of 300 new homes. The work did not proceed as the shopping centre was sold.

In work commencing 2012, the Borough&#x27;s Civic Offices were converted from the former main office of The Woolwich, which had been vacant seven years. For the resultant vacant site in June 2018, housebuilder Bellway was approved to build 518 homes, of which 110 affordable. The development will include Bexleyheath&#x27;s tallest building (13 storeys), public realm improvements and offices/retail.

Given cumulative retail investment, Bexleyheath draws many customers particularly from Erith, Thamesmead, Plumstead and Woolwich which adjoin the River Thames.

==Leisure and culture==
Bexleyheath has leisure facilities including the Edward Alderton Theatre, Cineworld cinema, hotel, the Central Library, Bexley Local Studies and Archive Centre, five-a-side football centre, bingo hall and ten-pin bowling alley (Ten Pin).

Bexleyheath and Belvedere Hockey Club are based in Welling, but play some home matches at Erith School.

Cultural events include regular concerts by the Sidcup Symphony Orchestra held in the hall of Townley Grammar School. The town&#x27;s theatre, founded in 1976, produces many amateur productions.

==Education==

Bexleyheath has eight primary schools and four secondary schools.

<doc id="93890" wikidata="Q122241" url="?curid=93890" title="Biggin Hill">
<text>Biggin Hill is a town in the London Borough of Bromley, about south-southeast of Charing Cross. It is separated from London&#x27;s built-up area by the Metropolitan green belt and is located adjacent to the Greater London boundary with Kent and Surrey. Prior to the creation of Greater London in 1965, it was part of Kent. At the 2011 Census, Biggin Hill had a population of 9,951.

Biggin Hill is one of the highest points of Greater London, rising to over above sea level. Biggin Hill Airport occupies land formerly used by RAF Biggin Hill, one of the principal fighter bases protecting London from German bombers during the Battle of Britain.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Historically, the settlement was known as Aperfield.

===Local government===
Biggin Hill formed part of Cudham, an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Following the Local Government Act 1894 it formed part of Bromley Rural District. The parish became part of Orpington Urban District in 1934. Kent County Council formed the second tier of local government from 1889. In 1965, the London County Council was abolished and replaced by the Greater London Council, with an expanded administrative area, so that Biggin Hill is now part of the London Borough of Bromley.

==Buildings==
The most architecturally noteworthy building within Biggin Hill is St Mark&#x27;s Church, Church Road – &#x27;the moving church&#x27; - designed by Richard Gilbert Scott. It was erected in the 1950s using the dismantled materials from All Saints Church, North Peckham. Much of the work was undertaken by volunteers led by Rev Vivian Symons who undertook much of the decorative work himself.

==Airport==

Biggin Hill has an airport—more than an airfield as it has a terminal building and customs facilities—London Biggin Hill Airport, which uses much of the land formerly used by RAF Biggin Hill, an aerodrome best known for its role during the Battle of Britain. The airfield was the location of the &quot;Operations Room&quot; for the Operation Crossbow V-1 flying bomb defence during World War II.

The old &quot;west camp&quot; of the airport is now owned by Bernie Ecclestone. Most of the buildings in the West Camp are Grade II listed. A small section remains in the care of the RAF, and the Grade II listed chapel (guarded by replicas of the station gate guardians, a Hawker Hurricane and a Supermarine Spitfire) is open to the public.

Many ghosts are commonly attributed to the World War II airbase.

The old &quot;south camp&quot; is now occupied by the Biggin Hill Business Park, Airport Industrial Estate and various private flying clubs. There are further commercial premises, hangars, private flying clubs and a helicopter joy-ride and pilot training centre to the east of the main runway.

The airport is host to a wide range of private and business jet and turbo-prop aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 737. In the 21st century it was enlarged and improved, and further expansion was planned.

A model aircraft site operates within its Air Traffic Zone, operating large model aircraft. In 2009 there were sightings of model aircraft traffic and one air proximity report was filed, according to the Airport Consultative Committee in May 2010.

Biggin Hill is the location of a VOR-DME navigational beacon, codenamed &quot;BIG&quot;, which anchors the South East Arrival Stack for London Heathrow Airport.

The airport was the venue of the Biggin Hill International Air Fair, an annual airshow that usually took place towards the end of June. The event was first held in 1963 and the airshow was permanently cancelled in 2010, shortly after the 48th event.

The airport featured in the 2006 film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; starring Tom Hanks. 

==Education==
Charles Darwin School is a secondary school within three miles of the centre.

Two main primary schools operate: Oaklands Primary School and Biggin Hill Primary School. Beyond the outskirts are Cudham CoE Primary School near Foal Farm, Tatsfield Primary in Tatsfield to the west and Downe Primary in Downe village.

==Demographics==
The area is represented by the Biggin Hill ward, which according to the 2011 UK census had a population of 9,951 and a density of 12 people per hectare. The census showed that 93% of the population was White British. The median age of the population was 42. The most common accommodation type was detached houses or bungalows.

==Location==
Biggin Hill is on the outskirts of the London Borough of Bromley. The A233 road is the only main road that runs through the area, from North to South. Most of the settlements that surround Biggin Hill are small towns and villages. Biggin Hill&#x27;s postcode is TN16, and its post town is Westerham (although Westerham itself is located outside Greater London).

==Transport==
Biggin Hill is part of the Transport for London operating area and is thus served by several London Buses services as well as one route operated by Southdown PSV. Buses provide connections to Bromley, Keston, Hayes, Bromley, Westerham, Downham, Catford, Oxted, Locksbottom, New Addington, Tatsfield, Orpington and Green Street Green.

The nearest National Rail station to Biggin Hill is Hayes station (located 5 miles away) as well as Oxted station in Surrey plus Bromley South station and Orpington station. The nearest Tramlink stop is New Addington located 4 miles away.

<doc id="93893" wikidata="Q205817" url="?curid=93893" title="London Borough of Islington">
<text>The London Borough of Islington ( ) is a London borough which forms part of Inner London, England. Islington has an estimated population of 215,667. It was formed in 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, by the amalgamation of the metropolitan boroughs of Islington and Finsbury.

The new entity remains the second smallest borough in London and the third-smallest district in England. The borough contains two Westminster parliamentary constituencies; Islington North, represented by former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, and Islington South &amp; Finsbury represented by Labour MP Emily Thornberry. The local authority is Islington Council. The borough is home to football club Arsenal, one of the Premier League clubs in England, and its home Emirates Stadium.

==Etymology==
Islington was originally named by the Saxons &quot;Giseldone&quot; (1005), then &quot;Gislandune&quot; (1062). The name means &#x27;Gīsla&#x27;s hill&#x27; from the Old English personal name Gīsla and &quot;dun&quot; &#x27;hill&#x27;, &#x27;down&#x27;. The name then later mutated to &quot;Isledon&quot;, which remained in use well into the 17th century when the modern form arose. In medieval times, Islington was just one of many small manors in the area, along with &quot;Bernersbury&quot;, &quot;Neweton Berewe&quot; or &quot;Hey-bury&quot;, and &quot;Canonesbury&quot; (Barnsbury, Highbury and Canonbury – names first recorded in the 13th and 14th centuries). &quot;Islington&quot; came to be applied as the name for the parish covering these villages, which became the Metropolitan Borough of Islington in 1900. On the merger with Finsbury to form the modern borough, the Islington name was used for the whole borough.

==History==
The area of the modern borough had historically been part of the county of Middlesex. From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs, two of which were called Islington and Finsbury, the latter covering the combined area of the parishes of Clerkenwell, St Luke and St Sepulchre, and the extra-parochial areas of Charterhouse and Glasshouse Yard.

The modern borough was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It was a merger of the old Islington and Finsbury metropolitan boroughs.

==Geography==
The southern part of the borough, south of the A501 Pentonville Road and City Road, forms part of the central London congestion charging zone and the Ultra Low Emission Zone. A significant part of the southern section of the borough borders the City of London, with the area to the west bordering the London Borough of Camden. The central London area includes Farringdon and Old Street stations both in Zone 1.

Islington South and Finsbury is represented by Emily Thornberry, former Shadow First Secretary of State and Shadow Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and current Shadow Secretary of State for International Trade of the Labour Party.

==Economy==
In the Victorian Age, some parts of Islington such as Clerkenwell were known for their poverty, which George Gissing describes in his naturalist novel, The Nether World (1889). Since this time, Islington has been a subject of gentrification and with the median house price rising rapidly since the 2020 pandemic. With new headquarters for Facebook and Google close to the edge of the borough, along with Lawyer offices Slaughter &amp; May on the edge of the borough, near the City of London, the borough has seen a steady house prices, with median incomes rising significantly.

==Demographics==
In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 65,721. This rose steadily throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; exceeding 200,000 in the middle of the century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased—reaching nearly 400,000 by the turn of the century; with the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury particularly suffering deprivation, poverty and severe overcrowding. The increase in population peaked before World War I, falling slowly in the aftermath until World War II began an exodus from London towards the new towns under the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944). The decline in population reversed in the 1980s, but it remains below its 1951 level.

According to the 2001 census Islington had a population of 175,797. It was 75% White, including 5% White Irish, 6% Black African, 5% Black Caribbean and 2% Bangladeshi. Thirty-two per cent of the borough&#x27;s residents were owner–occupiers.

According to the 2011 census, Islington has the highest population density of local authorities in England and Wales—13,875 people per square kilometre.

Islington has the second highest proportion of Irish people in the country, behind London Borough of Brent.

A 2017 study by Trust for London and the New Policy Institute found that a third of Islington residents lived in poverty. This is above the London average of 27%. It also found that 14% of local employees were in jobs which pay below the London Living Wage – the fourth lowest figure of any London borough.

39% of the borough&#x27;s residents identified as Christian, 12.8% Muslim, 1.7% Jewish and 42.7% had no religion. Christians and Muslims live throughout the borough, while the Jewish population is most concentrated in the north of the borough in the Hillrise and Junction wards (bordering Highgate and Crouch End).

<text>Blackheath is an area in Southeast London, straddling the border of the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Lewisham. Historically within the county of Kent, it is located northeast of Lewisham, south of Greenwich and southeast of Charing Cross, the traditional centre of London.

The area southwest of its station and in its ward is named Lee Park. Its northern neighbourhood of Vanbrugh Park is also known as St John&#x27;s Blackheath and despite forming a projection has amenities beyond its traditional reach named after the heath. To its west is the core public green area that is the heath and Greenwich Park, in which sit major London tourist attractions including the Greenwich Observatory and the Greenwich Prime Meridian. Blackheath railway station is south of the heath.

==History==
===Etymology===
;Records and meanings

The name is from Old English spoken words &#x27;blæc&#x27; and &#x27;hǣth&#x27;. The name is recorded in 1166 as &quot;Blachehedfeld&quot; which means &quot;dark, or black heath field&quot; – field denotes an enclosure or clearing. Lewis&#x27;s topological dictionary opines, considering the adjective developed equally into derived term bleak, that Blackheath &quot;takes its name either from the colour of the soil, or from the bleakness of its situation&quot; before adding, reflecting Victorian appreciation, mention of &quot;numerous villas with which it now abounds...it is pleasantly situated on elevated ground, commanding diversified and extensive views of the surrounding country, which is richly cultivated, and abounds with fine scenery&quot;. It was an upland, open space that was the meeting place of the hundred of Blackheath.

;Formal name for estates around the heath
By 1848 Blackheath was noted as a place with two dependent chapels under Lewisham vestry and another, St Michael and All Angels, erected 1828-1830 designed by George Smith. The latter made use of £4000 plus land from land developer John Cator, plus a further £11,000 from elsewhere. The name of Blackheath gained independent official boundaries by the founding of an Anglican parish in 1854 (construction of the parish church, All Saints, began in 1857), then others (in 1859, 1883 and 1886) which reflected considerable housing built on nearby land. In local government, Blackheath never saw independence; at first split between the Lewisham, Lee, Charlton and Greenwich vestries or civil parish councils and Kidbrooke liberty, which assembled into Greenwich, Plumstead (in final years called Lee) and Lewisham Districts then re-assembled with others into Greenwich and Lewisham metropolitan boroughs in 1900.

;Etymological myth
An urban myth is Blackheath could derive from the 1665 Plague or the Black Death of the mid-14th century. A local burial pit is nonetheless likely during the Black Death, given the established village and safe harbour (hithe) status of Greenwich. At those times the high death rate meant that a guaranteed churchyard burial became impractical.

===Archaeology===
A key Celtic trackway (becoming a Roman road and later Watling Street) scaled the rise that is shared with Greenwich Park and a peak east-by-southeast, Shooters Hill. In the west this traversed the mouth of Deptford Creek (the River Ravensbourne) (a corruption or throwback to earlier pronunciation of deep ford). Other finds can be linked to passing trade connected with royal palaces. In 1710, several Roman urns were dug up, two of which were of fine red clay, one of a spherical, and the other of a cylindrical, form; and in 1803, several more were discovered in the gardens of the Earl of Dartmouth and given to the British Museum.

===Royal setting===

Certain monarchs passed through and their senior courtiers kept residences here and in Greenwich. Before the Tudor-built Greenwich Palace and Stuart-built Queen&#x27;s House, one of the most frequently used was Eltham Palace about to the southeast of the ridge, under the late Plantagenets, before cessation as a royal residence in the 16th century.

On the north side of the heath, Ranger&#x27;s House, a medium-sized red brick Georgian mansion in the Palladian style, backs directly onto Greenwich Park. Associated with the Ranger of Greenwich Park, a royal appointment, the house was the Ranger&#x27;s official residence for most of the 19th century (neighbouring Montagu House, demolished in 1815, was a royal residence of Caroline of Brunswick). Since 2002, Ranger&#x27;s House has housed the Wernher Collection of art.

The Pagoda is a notably exquisite home, built in 1760 by Sir William Chambers in the style of a traditional Chinese pagoda. It was later leased to the Prince Regent, principally used as a summer home by Caroline of Brunswick.

===Meeting point===
Blackheath was a rallying point for Wat Tyler&#x27;s Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, and for Jack Cade&#x27;s Kentish rebellion in 1450 (both recalled by road names on the west side of the heath). After camping at Blackheath, Cornish rebels were defeated at the foot of the west slope in the Battle of Deptford Bridge (sometimes called the Battle of Blackheath) on 17 June 1497.

In 1400, Henry IV of England met here with Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos who toured western royalty to seek support to oppose Bayezid I (Bajazet), the Ottoman Sultan. In 1415, the lord mayor and aldermen of London, in their robes of state, attended by 400 of the principal citizens, clothed in scarlet, came hither in procession to meet Henry V of England on his triumphant return from the Battle of Agincourt.

Blackheath was, along with Hounslow Heath, a common assembly point for army forces, such as in 1673 when the Blackheath Army was assembled under Marshal Schomberg to serve in the Third Anglo-Dutch War. In 1709–10, army tents were set up on Blackheath to house a large part of the 15,000 or so German refugees from the Palatinate and other regions who fled to England, most of whom subsequently settled in America or Ireland.

With Watling Street carrying stagecoaches across the heath, en route to north Kent and the Channel ports, it was also a notorious haunt of highwaymen during the 17th and 18th centuries. As reported in Edward Walford&#x27;s &quot;Old and New London&quot; (1878), &quot;In past times it was planted with gibbets, on which the bleaching bones of men who had dared to ask for some extension of liberty, or who doubted the infallibility of kings, were left year after year to dangle in the wind.&quot; In 1909 Blackheath had a local branch of the London Society for Women&#x27;s Suffrage.

===Mineral extraction===
The Vanbrugh Pits, known locally as the Dips, are on the north-east of the heath. A former gravel workings site, it has long been reclaimed by nature and form a feature in its near-flat expanse; particularly attractive in spring when its gorse blossoms brightly.

===Vanbrugh Park===
The remains of the pits and adjoining neighbourhood Vanbrugh Park, a north-east projection of Blackheath with its own church, so also termed St John&#x27;s Blackheath, are named after Sir John Vanbrugh, architect of Blenheim Palace and Castle Howard, who had a house with very large grounds adjoining the heath and its continuation Greenwich Park. The house which was originally built around 1720 remains, remodelled slightly, Vanbrugh Castle. In his estate he had &#x27;Mince Pie House&#x27; built for his family, which survived until 1911.

Its church, St John the Evangelist&#x27;s, was designed in 1853 by Arthur Ashpitel. The Blackheath High School buildings on Vanbrugh Park include the Church Army Chapel.

===Blackheath Park===

Blackheath Park occupies almost all of former Wricklemarsh House. Developed into upper middle class homes by John Cator, it forms the south-east of Blackheath: from Lee Road, Roque Lane, Fulthorp Road and the Plantation to all houses and gardens of right-angled Manor Way. Built up in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it contains large and refined Georgian and Victorian houses – particularly Michael Searles&#x27; crescent of semi-detached/terrace houses linked by colonnades, The Paragon (). Its alternate name, the Cator Estate, extends to lands earlier those of Sir John Morden, whose Morden College (1695) is a landmark in the north, with views of the heath. The estate has 1950s and &#x27;60s Span houses and flats with gardens with discreet parking.

Its Anglican church (St Michael &amp; All Angels) is dubbed the &quot;Needle of Kent&quot; in honour of its tall, thin spire (it is also nicknamed the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Pick&quot; or the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Toothpick&quot;). Nearby, within the Blackheath Park conservation area, is Our Lady of Christians Church, a Catholic church built from 1890 to 1891 and designed by Alfred Edward Purdie in the Gothic Revival style. It has a complete set of stained glass windows by Hardman &amp; Co. and it is a Grade II listed building.

===Other churches===

The Church of the Ascension (see local II* listed buildings) was founded by Susannah Graham late in the 17th century. Its rebuilding was arranged about 1750 by her descendant, the 1st Earl of Dartmouth. Further rebuilding took place in the 1830s leaving at least parts of the east end from the earlier rebuild. At this time galleries for worshippers overlooked three sides. 

===Ownership and management of the heath===

Under the (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. lvii), the management of the heath passed by statute to the Metropolitan Board of Works. Unlike the commons of Hackney, Tooting Bec and Clapham, its transfer was agreed at no expense, because the Earl of Dartmouth agreed to allow the encroachment to his manorial rights. It is held in trust for public benefit under the Metropolitan Commons Act 1866 (29 &amp; 30 Vict. c. 122). It passed to the London County Council in 1889, then to the Greater London Council, then in 1986 to the two boroughs of Greenwich and Lewisham, as to their respective extents. No trace can be found of use as common land but only as minimal fertility land exploited by its manorial owners (manorial waste) and mainly for small-scale mineral extraction. Main freeholds (excluding many roads) vest in the Earl of Dartmouth and, as to that part that was the Royal Manor of Greenwich, the Crown Estate. The heath&#x27;s chief natural resource is gravel, and the freeholders retain rights over its extraction.

==Sport==
In 1608, according to tradition, Blackheath was the place where golf was introduced to England – the Royal Blackheath Golf Club (based in nearby Eltham since 1923) was one of the first golf associations established (1766) outside Scotland. Blackheath also gave its name to the first hockey club, established during the mid 19th century.

In the 18th century, Blackheath was the home of Greenwich Cricket Club and a venue for cricket matches. The earliest known senior match was Kent v London in August 1730. A contemporary newspaper report said &quot;the Kentish champions would have lost their honours by being beat at one innings if time had permitted&quot;. The last recorded match was Kent v London in August 1769, Kent winning by 47 runs.

Cricket continued to be played on the &#x27;Heath&#x27; but at a junior level. By 1890, London County Council was maintaining 36 pitches. Blackheath Cricket Club has been part of the sporting fabric of the area, joining forces with Blackheath Rugby Club in 1883 to purchase and develop the Rectory Field as a home ground in Charlton. Blackheath Cricket Club hosted 84 first-class Kent County matches between 1887 and 1971.

Blackheath Rugby Club, founded in 1858, is one of the oldest documented rugby clubs in the world and was located until 2016 at Rectory Field on Charlton Road. The Blackheath club also organised the world&#x27;s first rugby international (between England and Scotland in Edinburgh on 27 March 1871) and hosted the first international between England and Wales ten years later – the players meeting and getting changed at the Princess of Wales public house. Blackheath was one of the 12 founding members of the Football Association in 1863, as well as nearby Blackheath Proprietary School and Percival House (Blackheath).

Along with neighbouring Greenwich Park, Blackheath is the start point of the London Marathon. This maintains a connection with athletics dating back to the establishment of the Blackheath Harriers (now Blackheath and Bromley Harriers Athletic Club) in 1869. One of the Marathon start routes runs past the entrance to Blackheath High School for Girls, home of Blackheath Fencing Club.

There is also a long history of kite flying on the heath.

==Geography==
Blackheath is one of the largest areas of common land in Greater London, with of protected commons. The heath is managed by Lewisham and Greenwich councils. Highlights on the Greenwich side include the Long Pond (also known as Folly Pond), close to the main entrance of Greenwich Park. On the Lewisham side are three ponds, with Hare and Billet pond considered to be the most natural and probably the best wildlife habitat. Lewisham retains important areas of acid grassland that support locally rare wild plants such as Common stork&#x27;s bill, Fiddle dock and Spotted medick. Key areas are to the east of Granville Park between South Row and Morden Row and on the cricket field east of Golfers Road.

The heath&#x27;s habitat was well known to early botanists. In the 18th century Carl Linnaeus reportedly fell to his knees to thank God when he first saw the gorse growing there. However, this disputed account is more often attributed to Putney Heath. This environment supported both the flora and fauna of wild grassland. In 1859, Greenwich Natural History Society recorded a wide list of animal species, including natterjack toads, hares, common lizards, bats, quail, ring ouzel and nightingale. Today, bats remain and migrating ring ouzel may occasionally be seen in spring.

Extensive mineral extraction in the 18th and early 19th centuries, when gravel, sand and chalk were extracted left the heath transformed. This left large pits in many parts. In 1945 pits were filled with bomb rubble from World War II, then covered with topsoil and seeded with rye grass, leaving Vanbrugh Pits to the north-east side and Eliot Pits in the south-west. Infilled areas stand out, especially in late spring and early summer, from their deep-green rye grass.

==Culture and community==

Two clusters of amenities vie for retail and leisure: the &quot;Village&quot; around Blackheath railway station to the south of the heath and the &quot;Standard&quot; in the north of St Johns/Vanburgh Park i.e. beyond the A2 road, named after the Royal Standard pub (in Greenwich). The north of the green is in the Westcombe Park neighbourhood, which has its own railway station about 400 metres north – part of East Greenwich. The total green and fountain sub-green was at first one village green, known during the 18th century as Sheepgate Green, beside a crossroads of what was the London-Dover road. Around 1885 local philanthropist William Fox Batley had it refurbished and it became known as Batley Green or Batley Park; Batley&#x27;s contribution is recorded in an inscription on a memorial fountain.

Just south of the railway station is the Blackheath Conservatoire of Music and the Arts. It is located close to Blackheath Halls, a concert venue today owned and managed by Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance. To the north of the railway station, in Tranquil Vale, All Saints&#x27; Parish Hall is a locally listed building in Arts and Crafts style, built in 1928. It has housed the Mary Evans Picture Library since 1988.

The heath was host to an annual fireworks display on the Saturday in November closest to Guy Fawkes Night. This was jointly organised and financed by the London Boroughs of Greenwich and Lewisham, but Greenwich Council withdrew its share of the funding in 2010. The event was suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and central government funding cuts forced its suspension from 2021. 

In September 2014, the inaugural &quot;On Blackheath&quot; festival was hosted on the heath. The line-up included Massive Attack, Frank Turner and Grace Jones. The festival was repeated in September in 2015 (included Elbow, Madness and Manic Street Preachers), 2016 (included Primal Scream, James and Squeeze), 2017 (included The Libertines, Travis and Metronomy), and 2018 (included Squeeze, De La Soul and Paloma Faith) then moved to July in 2019 (included Jamiroquai, Grace Jones, Soul II Soul). The event was cancelled during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021.

<text>Bloomsbury is a district in the West End of London, part of the London Borough of Camden in England. It is considered a fashionable residential area, and is the location of numerous cultural, intellectual, and educational institutions.
Bloomsbury is home of the British Museum, the largest museum in the United Kingdom, and several educational institutions, including University College London and a number of other colleges and institutes of the University of London as well as its central headquarters, the New College of the Humanities, the University of Law, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the British Medical Association and many others. Bloomsbury is an intellectual and literary hub for London, as home of world-known Bloomsbury Publishing, publishers of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, and namesake of the Bloomsbury Group, a group of British intellectuals which included author Virginia Woolf, biographer Lytton Strachey, and economist John Maynard Keynes.

Bloomsbury began to be developed in the 17th century under the Earls of Southampton, but it was primarily in the 19th century, under the Duke of Bedford, that the district was planned and built as an affluent Regency era residential area by famed developer James Burton. The district is known for its numerous garden squares, including Bloomsbury Square, Russell Square and Bedford Square.

Bloomsbury&#x27;s built heritage is currently protected by the designation of a conservation area and a locally based conservation committee. Despite this, there is increasing concern about a trend towards larger and less sensitive development, and the associated demolition of Victorian and Georgian buildings.

==History==

Bloomsbury (including the closely linked St Giles area) has a long association with neighbouring Holborn; but is nearly always considered as distinct from Holborn.

===Origins and etymology===
The area appears to have been a part of the parish of Holborn when St Giles hospital was established in the early 1100s.

The earliest record of the name, Bloomsbury, is as &quot;Blemondisberi&quot; in 1281. It is named after a member of the Blemund family who held the manor. There are older records relating to the family in London in 1201 and 1230. Their name, Blemund, derives from Blemont, a place in Vienne, in western France. At the end of the 14th century, Edward III acquired Blemond&#x27;s manor, and passed it on to the Carthusian monks of the London Charterhouse. The area remained rural at this time.

In the 16th century with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII took the land back into the possession of the Crown and granted it to Thomas Wriothesley, 1st Earl of Southampton.

===Administrative history===

The area was part of the Ancient Parish of St Giles, served by the church of St Giles in the Fields. Some sources indicate that the parish was in place before 1222 while others suggest 1547. From 1597 onwards, English parishes were obliged to take on a civil as well as ecclesiastical role, starting with the relief of the poor.

In 1731 a small new independent parish of &quot;Bloomsbury&quot; was created, based on a small area round Bloomsbury Square. In 1774 these parishes recombined, for civil purposes, to form the parish of &quot;St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury&quot; – which had the same boundaries as the initial parish of &quot;St Giles&quot;.

The area of the combined civil parish was used for the St Giles District (Metropolis), established under the Metropolis Management Act 1855. This body managed certain infrastructure functions, while the civil parish continued with its responsibilities until the abolishment of the Poor Law in 1930; however it was not formally abolished until the creation of Greater London in 1965.
In 1900 the area of the &quot;St Giles District (Metropolis)&quot; merged with Holborn District (Metropolis) (excluding those parts of Finsbury Division which had been temporarily attached to Holborn) to form a new Metropolitan Borough of Holborn. The traditional boundaries of &quot;St Giles&quot; and &quot;Bloomsbury&quot; were used for wards in the new borough, though these were subject to minor rationalisations to reflect the modern street pattern rather than the historic basis of the older streets and pre-urban field boundaries. The combined civil parish continued to operate, in parallel, for a considerable time after.

In 1965 the Metropolitan Borough of Holborn merged with St Pancras and Hampstead to form the new London Borough of Camden.

===Boundaries===
The formal historic boundaries of the combined parish of &quot;St Giles in the Fields and St George Bloomsbury&quot; (as adjusted in some places to reflect the modern street pattern) include Tottenham Court Road to the west, Torrington Place (formerly known, in part, as Francis Street) to the north, the borough boundary to the south and Marchmont Street and Southampton Row to the east.
The western boundary of Tottenham Court Road is common to all and a northern limit of Euston Road is often understood, though Coram&#x27;s Fields and the land to the north, consisting mainly of blocks of flats, built as both private and social housing was traditionally associated as being north Bloomsbury with Judd Street and its surrounding squares being part of St Pancras, King&#x27;s Cross.

The eastern boundary is sometimes taken to be in the region of Southampton Row or further east on Grays Inn Road. The southern extent is taken to approximates to High Holborn or the thoroughfare formed by New Oxford Street, Bloomsbury Way and Theobalds Road.

On the west side, the traditional and various informal definitions of the area are all based on the ancient Tottenham Court Road. The differences between the formal and more recent understandings of the area (to the north and south), seem to derive from Bloomsbury having been commonly misconceived as being coterminous with the Bedford Estate.

===Development===
In the early 1660s, the Earl of Southampton, who held the manors of St Giles and Bloomsbury, constructed what eventually became Bloomsbury Square. &quot;The Yorkshire Grey&quot; public house on the corner of Gray&#x27;s Inn Road and Theobald&#x27;s Road dates from 1676. The estate passed to the Russell family following the marriage of William Russell, Lord Russell (1639–1683) (third son of William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford) to Rachel Wriothesley, heiress of Bloomsbury, younger of the two daughters and co-heiresses of Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton (1607–1667). Rachel&#x27;s son and heir was Wriothesley Russell, 2nd Duke of Bedford (1680–1711), of Woburn Abbey in Bedfordshire, whose family also owned Covent Garden, south of Bloomsbury, acquired by them at the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

The area was laid out mainly in the 18th century, largely by Wriothesley Russell, 3rd Duke of Bedford, who built Bloomsbury Market, which opened in 1730. His younger brother, John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, would have built a circus here but he died in 1771, leaving his wife to continue development of the area. She commissioned the construction of Bedford Square and of Gower Street. The major development of the squares that we see today started in about 1800 when Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford, demolished Bedford House and developed the land to the north with Russell Square as its centrepiece. Much is still owned today by the Bedford Estate in trust for the Russell family.

John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, extended development on the north and east side of the estate, this area would then be frequented by writers, painters and musicians as well as lawyers due to the nearby Inns of Court. The area was enclosed by gates until these were abolished under a 1893 Act of Parliament. In the 19th century, the Bloomsbury area became less fashionable, now dominated by the University of London and the British Museum as well as numerous new hospitals. Modern development has destroyed several Georgian-era buildings, but some remain.

===London Beer Flood===
The London Beer Flood (also known as the &quot;Great Beer Flood&quot;) was a disaster that occurred in October 1814, when a large vat of porter at the Horse Shoe Brewery, just west of Dyott Street, burst open, releasing a 15-foot wave of beer onto the surrounding streets, killing eight people.

==Conservation==

All of the geographic area of Bloomsbury is covered by the Bloomsbury Conservation Area, an historic designation designed to limit new development, and ensure that changes to the built environment preserve and enhance its special character. This conservation area is one of the oldest and most significant in the UK, having been designated in 1968, less than a year after conservation areas were promulgated in the Civic Amenities Act 1967.

The Bloomsbury Conservation Area is almost unique in the UK in that it also has a &quot;conservation area advisory committee&quot;, an expert committee of architects, planners, lawyers, and other community members that also live and work in Bloomsbury. This group was founded in 1968 by the local authority and continues to serve Bloomsbury and the surrounding area. It is generally thought that the Bloomsbury Conservation Area Advisory Committee (BCAAC) has the most detailed knowledge of Bloomsbury&#x27;s built heritage and social history due to its members having lived in the area for many decades. It is accordingly consulted with on all major and minor development proposals in the area, including traffic circulation changes, and its objections carry formal planning weight through the local authority&#x27;s constitution.

Bloomsbury contains one of the highest proportions of listed buildings and monuments per square metre of any conservation area, including many of the UK&#x27;s most iconic buildings, such as the British Museum. However its strategic location in the centre of London and associated high development pressures has seen a rise in the demolition of historic fabric, and the construction of tall and harmful development. Between 2015 and 2020 the local authority recommended approval for a total of five major developments judged to be harmful by the BCAAC, with the Greater London Authority approving one. The BCAAC were only successful in defeating one of those developments.

As a result, Victorian buildings and even some of Bloomsbury&#x27;s famous Georgian terraces have been demolished in recent years. This has led to sharp criticism of the local authority&#x27;s approach to the conservation and preservation of Bloomsbury, with national heritage groups such as the Victorian Society and Georgian Group voicing concerns along with local groups. A local campaign associated with the BCAAC, Save Bloomsbury, has written and campaigned extensively to protect Bloomsbury&#x27;s heritage. As of 2021 Camden Council has not adopted any strategy to ensure Bloomsbury&#x27;s conservation, and harmful development proposals continue to come forward.

==Nearby districts==
Neighbouring areas include St Pancras to the north and west, Fitzrovia to the west, Covent Garden and Holborn to the south, and Clerkenwell to the east.
For street name etymologies see &quot;Street names of Bloomsbury&quot;.

==Culture==
Historically, Bloomsbury is associated with the arts, education, and medicine. The area gives its name to the Bloomsbury Group of artists, among whom was Virginia Woolf, who met in private homes in the area in the early 1900s, and to the lesser known Bloomsbury Gang of Whigs formed in 1765 by John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. The publisher Faber &amp; Faber used to be located in Queen Square, though at the time T. S. Eliot was editor the offices were in Tavistock Square. The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais&#x27;s parents&#x27; house on Gower Street in 1848.

The Bloomsbury Festival was launched in 2006 when local resident Roma Backhouse was commissioned to mark the re-opening of the Brunswick Centre, a residential and shopping area. The free festival is a celebration of the local area, partnering with galleries, libraries and museums, and achieved charitable status at the end of 2012. As of 2013, the Duchess of Bedford is a festival patron and Festival Directors have included Cathy Maher (2013), Kate Anderson (2015–2019) and Rosemary Richards (2020–present).

===Educational institutions===

Bloomsbury is home to the federal University of London&#x27;s central administrative centre and library, Senate House, as well as many of its independent members institutions including Birkbeck College, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, School of Oriental and African Studies, School of Advanced Study, Royal Veterinary College, and University College London (which has now absorbed the formerly separate School of Eastern European and Slavonic Studies, School of Pharmacy, and Institute of Education academic institutions). Bloomsbury is also home to London Contemporary Dance School, Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, a branch of University of Law, Architectural Association School of Architecture, and the London campuses of several American colleges including Arcadia University, University of California, University of Delaware, Florida State University, Syracuse University, New York University, and Hult International Business School.

The growing private tutoring sector in Bloomsbury includes various tutoring businesses such as Bloomsbury International (for English language), Bloomsbury Law Tutors (for law education), Skygate Tutors, and Topmark Tutors Centre.

===Museums===

The British Museum, which first opened to the public in 1759 in Montagu House, is at the heart of Bloomsbury. At the centre of the museum the space around the former British Library Reading Room, which was filled with the concrete storage bunkers of the British Library, is today the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, an indoor square with a glass roof designed by British architect Norman Foster. It houses displays, a cinema, a shop, a cafe and a restaurant. Since 1998, the British Library has been located in a purpose-built building just outside the northern edge of Bloomsbury, in Euston Road.

Also in Bloomsbury is the Foundling Museum, close to Brunswick Square, which tells the story of the Foundling Hospital opened by Thomas Coram for unwanted children in Georgian London. The hospital, now demolished except for the Georgian colonnade, is today a playground and outdoor sports field for children, called Coram&#x27;s Fields. It is also home to a small number of sheep. The nearby Lamb&#x27;s Conduit Street is a pleasant thoroughfare with shops, cafes and restaurants.

The Dickens Museum is in Doughty Street. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology are at University College London in Gower Street.

The Postal Museum is on 15-20 Phoenix Place.

Bloomsbury contains several notable churches:

* St. George&#x27;s Church, Bloomsbury, located on Bloomsbury Way. This is Bloomsbury&#x27;s own parish church, and was built by Nicholas Hawksmoor between 1716 and 1731. It has a deep Roman porch with six huge Corinthian columns, and is notable for its steeple based on the Tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus and for the statue of King George I on the top.

==Parks and squares==

Bloomsbury contains some of London&#x27;s finest parks and buildings, and is particularly known for its formal squares. These include:
* Russell Square, a large and orderly square; its gardens were originally designed by Humphry Repton. Russell Square Underground station is a short distance away.

==Hospitals==
Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children and the Royal London Hospital for Integrated Medicine (formerly the Royal London Homoeopathic Hospital) are both located on Great Ormond Street, off Queen Square, which itself is home to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery (formerly the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases). Bloomsbury is also the location of University College Hospital, which re-opened in 2005 in new buildings on Euston Road, built under the government&#x27;s private finance initiative (PFI). The Eastman Dental Hospital is located on Gray&#x27;s Inn Road close to the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital administered by the Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust.

==Other notable buildings==
One of the largest building in the area is the Brutalist Brunswick Centre a residential building with a shopping centre at ground floor.

==Administration and representation==
Bloomsbury is in the parliamentary constituency of Holborn and St Pancras. The western half of the district comprises Bloomsbury ward, which elects three councillors to Camden Borough Council.

==Economy==

In February 2010, businesses were balloted on an expansion of the InHolborn Business Improvement District (BID) to include the southern part of Bloomsbury. Only businesses with a rateable value in excess of £60,000 could vote as only these would pay the BID levy. This expansion of the BID into Bloomsbury was supported by Camden Council. The proposal was passed and part of Bloomsbury was brought within the InHolborn BID.

Controversy was raised during this BID renewal when InHolborn proposed collecting Bloomsbury, St Giles and Holborn under the name of &quot;Midtown&quot;, since it was seen as &quot;too American&quot;. Businesses were informed about the BID proposals, but there was little consultation with residents or voluntary organisations. InHolborn produced a comprehensive business plan aimed at large businesses. Bloomsbury is now part of InMidtown BID with its 2010 to 2015 business plan and a stated aim to make the area &quot;a quality environment in which to work and live, a vibrant area to visit, and a profitable place in which to do business&quot;.

=== Cycling ===
Several cycle routes cross Bloomsbury, with cycling infrastructure provided and maintained by both the London Borough of Camden and Transport for London (TfL). Many routes across Bloomsbury feature segregated cycle tracks or bus lanes for use by cyclists. Additionally, Bloomsbury is connected to the wider London cycle network via several routes, including:

* Quietway 1 (Q1) - Running on segregated cycle track or residential streets, Q1 carries cyclists on an unbroken, signposted cycle route from Covent Garden, via Bloomsbury, to King&#x27;s Cross and Kentish Town.

<text>Brentford is a suburban town in West London, England and part of the London Borough of Hounslow. It lies at the confluence of the River Brent and the Thames, west of Charing Cross.

Its economy has diverse company headquarters buildings which mark the start of the M4 corridor; in transport it also has two railway stations and Boston Manor Underground station on its north-west border with Hanwell. Brentford has a convenience shopping and dining venue grid of streets at its centre. Brentford at the start of the 21st century attracted regeneration of its little-used warehouse premises and docks including the re-modelling of the waterfront to provide more economically active shops, townhouses and apartments, some of which comprises Brentford Dock. A 19th and 20th centuries mixed social and private housing locality: New Brentford is contiguous with the Osterley neighbourhood of Isleworth and Syon Park and the Great West Road which has most of the largest business premises.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name is recorded as &quot;Breguntford&quot; in 705 in an Anglo-Saxon charter and means &#x27;ford over the River Brent&#x27;.

The name of the river derives from *&quot;brigant-&quot;, a Brythonic word, meaning &quot;high&quot; or &quot;elevated&quot; (possibly in a holy sense). The river may also have been associated with the goddess Brigantia. The suffix &#x27;-ford&#x27; is Old English. The ford was most likely located where the main road crossed the river. &quot;New Brentford&quot; is recorded as &quot;Newe Braynford&quot; in 1521 and was previously known as &quot;Westbraynford&quot;. &quot;Old Brentford&quot; is recorded as &quot;Old Braynford&quot; in 1476 and was previously known as &quot;Estbraynford&quot;.

===Early Brentford===
The settlement pre-dates the Roman occupation of Britain, and thus pre-dates the founding of nearby London. Many pre-Roman artefacts have been excavated in and around the area in Brentford known as &#x27;Old England&#x27;. Bronze Age pottery and burnt flints have been found at separate sites in Brentford. The quality and quantity of the artefacts suggests that Brentford was a meeting point for pre-Romanic tribes. One well known Iron Age piece from about 100 BC – AD 50 is the Brentford horn-cap – a ceremonial chariot fitting that formed part of local antiquarian Thomas Layton&#x27;s collection, now held by the Museum of London. The Celtic knot pattern (the &#x27;Brentford Knot&#x27;) on this item has been copied for use on modern jewellery.


An amateur local history and an inscription outside the County Court claim that Julius Cæsar crossed the Thames here during his invasion of Britain in 54 BC, and fought a battle with Cassivellaunus close by. Cæsar describes the place as fortified with sharp stakes. The discovery of sharp stakes in the river-side at Brentford Dock in the early 20th century was taken by Montagu Sharpe as evidence of a fortified crossing-site, and Caesar&#x27;s battle. The stakes were removed as a hazard to river-traffic, and Sharpe&#x27;s claims are not supported by further excavations.

Historically part of Middlesex, in the south-eastern corner of Elthorne Hundred, it has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

===English Civil War===

In November 1642 a Royalist army advancing on London overcame a much smaller Parliamentarian force in battle at Brentford. The town was ransacked in the immediate aftermath of the engagement.

===Local fair===
A local town fair, the Brentford Festival, has been held in Brentford every September since 1900.

===Brentford Dock===

The building of Brentford Dock was started in 1855 and it was formally opened in 1859. The dock yard is now a Marina and housing estate.

===The Hardwick family===
A notable family from Brentford was the 18th-/19th-century architectural father and son partnership, the Hardwicks. Thomas Hardwick Senior (1725–1798) and Thomas Hardwick Junior (1752–1829) were both from Brentford and are buried in the old church of St Laurence. Hardwick Senior was the master mason for the Adam Brothers during the construction of Syon House. Hardwick Junior assisted in the building of Somerset House and was known for his designs of churches in the capital. He was also a tutor of J. M. W. Turner and he helped start Turner&#x27;s illustrious career in art. Both father and son did a great deal of remodelling and rebuilding on the church of St Laurence.

==Local government==
Brentford developed around the ancient boundary between the parishes of Ealing and Hanwell. It was divided between the chapelry of Old Brentford to the east in Ealing and the chapelry of New Brentford in Hanwell to the west. Of the two areas, Old Brentford was significantly larger.

New Brentford was first described as the county town of Middlesex in 1789, on the basis that it was the location of elections of knights for the shire (or Members of Parliament (MPs)) from 1701. In 1795 New Brentford (as it was then) was &quot;considered as the county-town; but there is no town-hall or other public building&quot; causing confusion that remains to this day (see county town of Middlesex).

The London Borough of Hounslow was formed in 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, by the merger of the areas of the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick, the Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth and Feltham Urban District of Middlesex.

==Demography and housing==

In Brentford, those who ethnically identify as BAME (Black, Asian and minority Ethnic) was 33.9% in the Brentford ward and 34.2% in the Syon ward at the 2011 UK census. The median age of the population was 32 years in Brentford ward and 34 years in Syon ward. Both wards have about equal proportions of household types, with flats/maisonettes/apartments forming a majority in both wards.

==Landmarks==
===The Syon estate===
Syon House, the Greater London residence of the Duke of Northumberland, is a large mansion and park in &quot;Syon&quot; ward, described above, that has long been shared with Isleworth. Some of its seasonally marshy land is now a public nature reserve. The estate has a hotel (Hilton London Syon Park), visitor centre and garden centre.

Syon Abbey, demolished and replaced (with reworked gatehouses) by the newer mansion, had the largest abbey church in England in the Middle Ages.

The location of Syon Abbey in the park was unknown until archeological investigations in the grounds in 2003 (for the television series &quot;Time Team&quot;) and 2004 revealed the foundations of the abbey church. It was larger than Westminster Abbey is now, but no above-ground structure remains. There were complex reasons for its destruction.

The London Butterfly House in Syon Park was an insectarium like a large glasshouse containing a butterfly zoo. Visitors could see butterflies and moths flying about, feeding, and emerging from chrysalises. There was also a colony of large ants (kept with the butterflies), a small tropical bird aviary, and a small gallery of reptiles, amphibians, insects and spiders. The lease on the current site expired in October 2007 and the Butterfly House closed on 28 October.

 Boston Manor House, built in 1622, is a Jacobean manor house, noted for its fine plasterwork ceilings.

Syon Park House (demolished in 1953, and not to be confused with Syon House itself) housed the &#x27;Syon Park Academy&#x27; where the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley was educated between the ages of 10 and 12 before moving on to Eton. A Royal Mail depot stands on the site now. This may also be the site of the dwelling where Pocahontas lived in Brentford End between 1616 and 1617.

===Brentford Monument===

In 1909 a monument was made out of two stone pillars that used to support lamps on the old Brentford bridge over the Grand Union Canal. The monument originally stood at the end of Ferry Lane; after being covered in coal unloaded from boats, it was moved further up the lane in 1955. In 1992 it was moved again to its present site at the junction of Brentford High Street and Alexandra Road, outside the County Court. The monument commemorates four major events in Brentford&#x27;s history: the supposed crossing of the Thames by Julius Caesar in 54 BC; the council of Brentford by King Offa of Mercia in 781; the defeat of King Canute by King Edmund Ironside at the first Battle of Brentford in 1016; and the second Battle of Brentford in 1642.

===Saint Paul&#x27;s Church===

Built in 1868 from Kentish ragstone, Saint Paul&#x27;s Church is one of Brentford&#x27;s two current Anglican parish churches, and a distinct landmark. Its spire is clearly visible. The architect was H. Francis and James Montgomrey was a principal subscriber and chairman of the building committee. In 1959 and 1961 the parishes of the nearby churches of Saint George and Saint Lawrence were amalgamated with Saint Paul.

Inside the church is a painting by local artist Johann Zoffany called &quot;Christ&#x27;s Last Supper&quot;. It was originally intended to be installed in St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, but the local people objected, and therefore in 1887 it was installed in Saint George&#x27;s Church instead. When that church was closed in 1959, the painting was transferred to its present location in Saint Paul&#x27;s Church.

===Saint Faith&#x27;s Church===
Brentford&#x27;s other Anglican parish church, Saint Faith&#x27;s, is a comparatively recent building, dating from 1906 to 1907. Designed in Gothic Revival style, by G F Bodley and D G Hare, it was described by the poet John Betjeman:

===Saint Lawrence&#x27;s Church===

There has been a church on the site of Brentford&#x27;s former parish church of Saint Lawrence since the 12th century, but the tower dates from the 15th century, and the remainder of the church was rebuilt in 1764 from brick. There were a number of interesting monuments in the church, including one dedicated to a Maurice de Berkeley, dating from 1189, who was buried in the original church. The church was closed in 1961 and the monuments removed, and the parish was united with Saint Paul&#x27;s. The church has now been in a derelict state for more than half a century but the graveyard still holds the Ronalds vault where Hugh Ronalds and numerous members of his family are buried. A war memorial stood outside the church until 2009, when it was moved to Brentford Library.

===Saint John the Evangelist&#x27;s Church===
St John the Evangelist Church, opened in 1866, was built for Irish railway construction workers, by an architect named Jackman.

===Saint George&#x27;s Church===
An unconsecrated chapel was built from subscriptions raised from 57 prominent inhabitants on the site in 1762; previously the parish was part of Ealing. The old chapel was demolished in 1886 and eventually replaced by the current building designed by A. W. Blomfield. The painting of the Last Supper by Zoffany was transferred to the new church. It was closed in 1959 and used as the home for the Musical Museum from 1963 until the Museum moved to new premises. It is now (2017) being converted into flats.

===On the periphery===
Gunnersbury Park Museum is in Gunnersbury House, narrowly in Gunnersbury (the north-west of Chiswick) containing artefacts and former furnishings of the Rothschild family, who were culturally and financially pre-eminent across France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and North America.

Kew Gardens is visible from the scattering of high rise buildings towering over the town and some of the mid rise ones.

The Weir public house, formerly &#x27;The White Horse&#x27;, was where the artist J. M. W. Turner lived for one year at the age of ten. He is regarded as having started his interest in painting while living there. Later he lived in Isleworth and Twickenham.
===Brentford Dock===
Brentford Dock came to single use and engineered enlargement as a freight terminus of the Great Western Railway. It was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built between 1855 and 1859 at the confluence of the River Thames and River Brent – part of the land was James Montgomrey&#x27;s Montgomrey&#x27;s Wharf. A spur line from the GWR at Southall was constructed to the Brentford Dock railway station to facilitate easy transferral of freight from lighters and barges on the Thames to GWR-served destinations in the west of the country. The dock was redeveloped as residential accommodation from the early 1970s, and little industrial archaeology remains. However, Dock Road still retains some of its original fan pattern cobblestone road bed and examples of Brunel&#x27;s broad-gauge &#x27;bridge section&#x27; rail can be seen there.

The &quot;Brentford Dock&quot; flats (originally named the &quot;Tiber Estate&quot;) were built alongside formerly important transport infrastructure as Brentford is the terminus of the Grand Union Canal, originally the Grand Junction Canal. This waterway is still in use for leisure traffic as part of the Grand Union Canal.

===Others===
Brentford Public Library is a Carnegie library, built by the architect Nowell Parr and opened in 1904. Outside the library is the Brentford War Memorial, accompanied by three smaller war memorials. There is also Jim Pooley&#x27;s bench honouring Robert Rankin&#x27;s writing connection with the borough.

Brentford Baths (1896), also by the architect Nowell Parr, is a Grade II listed example of late Victorian architecture.

The London Museum of Water &amp; Steam houses the world&#x27;s largest working beam engine, and its narrow cuboid tower is an emblem of the town.

The Musical Museum houses a large collection of mechanical musical instruments, such as player pianos and a Wurlitzer organ.

The Butts Estate, a Georgian square and associated conservation area, contains several Grade II listed buildings some dating back to 1680. In the Butts is located St Mary&#x27;s Convent, a grade II listed building from the late 18th century, now a convent and residential care home, Maryville Care Home.

==Sports==
Brentford F.C. is a professional English football club, based in Brentford, and currently playing in the Premier League.
The club was founded in 1889 by members of the defunct Brentford Rowing Club and plays its home games at the Gtech Community Stadium, having played at Griffin Park between 1904 and 2020. The club has a long-standing rivalry with near neighbours, Fulham and QPR. The Stadium was also used by the former Premiership Rugby side London Irish.

Griffin Park is also the former home of Chelsea Football Club Reserves. From 2002 until September 2005, it was the home of the London Broncos rugby league club – subsequently they were renamed Harlequins RL and transferred to The Stoop).

==In literature==
The phrase &#x27;like two kings of Brentford&#x27; refers to former enemies who are now good friends. It appears in:
* the play The Rehearsal (1672), by George Villiers,
* the poem The Sofa by William Cowper
* the novel Tom Cringle&#x27;s Log, by Michael Scott.

==In popular culture==

Brentford&#x27;s industrial status and the Great West Road are notable facets of Aldous Huxley&#x27;s 1932 novel &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Set in London in AD 2540 (632 A.F.—&quot;After Ford&quot;), the influential dystopia anticipates changes in reproductive technology, sleep-learning, psychological manipulation, and classical conditioning that combine to change society profoundly.

The BBC Three sitcom &quot;People Just Do Nothing&quot; is set in and around Brentford.

&quot;The Brentford Trilogy&quot;, a (ten-book) series of &quot;far-fetched fiction&quot; novels by Robert Rankin, humorously chronicle the lives of a couple of drunken middle-aged layabouts, Jim Pooley and John Omally, who confront the forces of darkness in the environs of western Greater London, usually with the assistance of large quantities of beer from their favourite public house, The Flying Swan. Several of Rankin&#x27;s other books are also set in or reference Brentford.

<text>Brixton is an area of South London, part of the London Borough of Lambeth, England. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London. Brixton experienced a rapid rise in population during the 19th century as communications with central London improved.

Brixton is mainly residential, though includes Brixton Market and a substantial retail sector. It is a multi-ethnic community, with a large percentage of its population of Afro-Caribbean descent. It lies within Inner London and is bordered by Stockwell, Clapham, Streatham, Camberwell, Tulse Hill, Balham and Herne Hill. The district houses the main offices of Lambeth London Borough Council.

Brixton is south-southeast from the geographical centre of London (measuring to a point near Brixton Underground station on the Victoria line).

==History==

===Toponymy===
The name Brixton is thought to originate from , meaning the stone of Brixi, a Saxon lord. Brixi is thought to have erected a boundary stone to mark the meeting place of the ancient Brixton hundred court of Surrey. The location is unknown but is thought to be at the top of Brixton Hill, at a road known at the time as Bristow or Brixton Causeway, long before any settlement in the area.

===Until the mid-19th century===
Brixton marks the rise from the marshes in the north of the ancient parish of Lambeth up to the hills of Upper Norwood and Streatham. At the time the River Effra flowed from its source in Upper Norwood through Herne Hill to Brixton. At Brixton the river was crossed by low bridges for Roman roads to the south coast, now Brixton Road and Clapham Road. The main roads were connected through a network of medieval country lanes, such as Acre Lane, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton Water Lane and Lyham Road, formerly Black Lane. It was only at the end of the 18th century that villages and settlements formed around Brixton, as the original woodland was gradually reduced until the area was covered in farmland and market gardens known for game and strawberries.

The area remained undeveloped until the beginning of the 19th century, the main settlements being near Stockwell, Brixton Hill and Coldharbour Lane. With the opening of Vauxhall Bridge in 1816, improved access to Central London led to a process of suburban development. The largest single development, and one of the last in suburban character, was Angell Town, laid out in the 1850s on the east side of Brixton Road, and so named after a family that owned land in Lambeth from the late 17th century until well into the 20th. As bridges were built across the Thames in the early 19th century those working in the City of London and the West End moved to south London. The first development was in Washway, now Brixton Road. With the enclosing of the Manor of Lambeth, owned by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in 1806 and the opening of Vauxhall Bridge in 1816, terraced houses and detached villas started to line the main roads. The Rush Common enclosure stipulations dictated that houses had to be set back from the main roads, allowing for generous gardens. St Matthew&#x27;s Church on part of the former common land was consecrated in 1824. The parish of St Matthew Brixton, one of five subdivisions of the ancient Lambeth parish, stretched from Camberwell Green in the northeast, to Clapham Road in the northwest, to the outer edge of Brockwell Park in the southeast and to Kingswood Road in the southwest.

Ashby&#x27;s Mill, one of the few surviving windmills in London, was built in 1816, just off Brixton Hill and surrounded by houses built during Brixton&#x27;s Victorian expansion. The Surrey House of Correction, later Brixton prison, was established in 1819.

As part of the Reform Act 1832 the expanding area of London was given representation with the creation of new parliamentary boroughs covering the metropolitan area. Only the part of Brixton north of St Matthew&#x27;s Church became part of the Lambeth parliamentary borough, reflecting the still semi-rural nature of the southern part of the area. The population of Brixton was 10,175 in 1841, about 10% of the parish of Lambeth. In twenty years the population of both had doubled.

===Victorian expansion===
When the London sewerage system was constructed during the mid-19th century, its designer Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated flows from the River Effra into his &#x27;high-level interceptor sewer&#x27;, also known as the Effra sewer.

Brixton was connected to central London by rail on 25 August 1862 when Brixton and South Stockwell railway station was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway on the line from Victoria. On 13 August 1866 the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway opened Loughborough Park railway station with connections to London Bridge and the following year to Victoria. With the arrival of the railways a building boom set in. Brixton was transformed into a middle class suburb between the 1860s and 1890s and Brixton developed into a major shopping centre. The first purpose-built department store, Bon Marché (Brixton), was opened on Brixton Road in 1877 and Electric Avenue was one of the first shopping arcades to have electric lighting. The now famous Brixton Market began in Atlantic Road and was moved to Station Road in the 1920s to ease traffic congestion.

In 1881 the population of Brixton was 62,837, now home to a quarter of the parish of Lambeth.

A prominent building on Brixton High Street (at 472–488 Brixton Road) is Morleys, an independent department store established in the 1880s. In 1888, Electric Avenue was so named after it became the first street in London to be lit by electricity. In this time, large expensive houses were constructed along the main roads in Brixton, which were converted into flats and boarding houses at the start of the 20th century as the middle classes were replaced by an influx of the working classes.

===Before World War II===
By 1925, Brixton attracted thousands of new people. It housed the largest shopping centre in south London at the time, as well as a thriving market, cinemas, pubs and a theatre. In the 1920s, Brixton was the shopping capital of south London with three large department stores and some of the earliest branches of what are now Britain&#x27;s major national retailers. Today, Brixton Road is the main shopping area, fusing into Brixton Market.

On the western boundary of Brixton with Clapham stands the Sunlight Laundry, an Art Deco factory building. Designed by architect F.E. Simpkins and erected in 1937, this is one of the few Art Deco buildings that is still owned by the firm that commissioned it and is still used for its original purpose.

The Brixton area was bombed during World War II, contributing to a severe housing crisis, which in turn led to urban decay. This was followed by slum clearances and the building of council housing.

===1948: The Windrush generation===


In the 1940s and 1950s, many immigrants, particularly from the West Indies and Ireland, settled in Brixton.

The first wave of immigrants (492 individuals) who formed the British African-Caribbean community arrived in 1948 at Tilbury Docks on the HMT &quot;Empire Windrush&quot; from Jamaica and were temporarily housed in the Clapham South deep shelter. The nearest Labour Exchange (Jobcentre) was on Coldharbour Lane, Brixton, and the new arrivals spread out into local accommodation.

Many immigrants only intended to stay in Britain for a few years, but although a number returned to the Caribbean, the majority remained to settle permanently. The arrival of the passengers has become an important landmark in the history of modern Britain, and the image of West Indians filing off its gangplank has come to symbolise the beginning of modern British multicultural society. In 1998 the area in front of Brixton Library was renamed &quot;Windrush Square&quot; to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of the &quot;Windrush&quot;.

===1980s: Riots after police actions and Scarman Report===
Brixton was the scene of riots in April 1981 at a time when Brixton underwent deep social and economic problems—high unemployment, high crime, poor housing, no amenities—in a predominantly African-Caribbean community. The Metropolitan Police began &quot;Operation Swamp 81&quot; at the beginning of April, aimed at reducing street crime, largely through the repeated use of the so-called sus law, which allowed police officers to stop and search any individual on the grounds of mere &quot;suspicion&quot; of possible wrongdoing. Plain clothes police officers were dispatched into Brixton, and within five days almost 1,000 people were stopped and searched under this law. There was intense local indignation at this, since the vast majority of those stopped by the police were young black men. The riot resulted in almost 279 injuries to police and 45 injuries to members of the public, more than a hundred vehicles were burned (including 56 police vehicles), and almost 150 buildings were damaged, with 30 burned. There were 82 arrests. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved in the riot.

Following the 1981 Brixton riot the Government commissioned a public inquiry into the riot headed by Lord Scarman. The subsequent Scarman report was published in November 1981 and found unquestionable evidence of the disproportionate and indiscriminate use of &#x27;stop and search&#x27; powers by the police against black people. The report made a number of recommendations and led to a new code for police behaviour in the &quot;Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&quot; and the creation of an independent Police Complaints Authority in 1985. The 1999 Macpherson Report, an investigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, found that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman report had been ignored and concluded that the police force was &quot;institutionally racist&quot;.

===1990s: Nail bombing===
John Major&#x27;s childhood roots in the area were used in a campaign poster leading up to the 1992 election: &quot;What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.&quot;

The 1995 riots were sparked by the death of a black man, Wayne Douglas, in police custody and occurred in an atmosphere of discontent about the gentrification of Brixton.

In April 1999, Brixton Market was the site of the first of three attacks known as the London nail bombings. The other two, which followed within a fortnight, were in Brick Lane, the heart of East London&#x27;s Bangladeshi community, and the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho, frequented predominantly by the gay community. In the Brixton attack, 48 people were injured. The bomber was caught after the third attack; the BBC reported that he intended to ignite a race war across Britain with his bombing campaign. He was convicted of murder and given six concurrent life sentences.

===2000s: Regeneration vs Gentrification===

There has been, and there remains great debate regarding whether Brixton&#x27;s recent renaissance should be deemed regeneration or gentrification. Some believe the area has slowly undergone a process of gentrification since the 1990s and has resulted in many wealthy middle-class people taking advantage of the area&#x27;s location and the thriving bohemian art scene. However, others argue that the area is undergoing exciting regeneration. In recent years, Brixton has hosted a regular farmers&#x27; market on Station Road, as well as Pop-up restaurants and pop-up shops. New art galleries, delicatessens, bars, cafes and vintage clothing stores, particularly in and around Brixton Village Market have also opened, which some believe is gentrifying the area in a similar way to that in nearby Clapham.
Pop Brixton exemplifies the ongoing discussion about regeneration. Originally created as a community project, opinion is divided over whether Pop fulfils its intentions of being part of the local community, with some arguing that Pop is seen as just another tourist and retail attraction, and that the council did not meaningfully engage with Brixton residents. Others have welcomed its arrival for its entrepreneurial approach and benefiting start-ups, and that it brings people into the area which has benefited trade and its popularity.

In April 2015, a Reclaim Brixton protest was held by local residents and activists opposing gentrification.

In March 2016, a campaign to save the businesses that occupy the railway arches commenced, with long-running local businesses being forced out due to rent-rises. The council passed the plans for Network Rail to refurbish them in August.

In May 2019, plans for a 20-storey tower block providing office space were unveiled by Taylor McWilliams, a Texan property developer whose company Hondo Enterprises had bought Brixton Market in 2018. This plan drew a large opposition from the local community and campaign groups, already concerned with the threat of eviction of a popular local supermarket. Despite a petition and overwhelming opposition, council planners approved the development on 3 November 2020. A subsequent decision is to be made by London mayor Sadiq Khan, the date so far for which has been postponed.

2023 saw the council begin the public consultation for the regeneration of 6 Canterbury Crescent (International House) and 49 Brixton Station Road (Pop Brixton).

==Transition town and local currency==
Brixton was one of the first inner-city based &#x27;Transition town&#x27; projects in the UK. Brockwell Park hosts the now annual Urban Green Fair, first held in summer 2007.

===Brixton pound===

The Brixton pound was first trialled at Transition Town Brixton&#x27;s &quot;Local Economy Day&quot; on 19 June 2008. It was then launched on 17 September 2009 by Transition Town Brixton. The Brixton pound is a local currency that is available as an alternative to sterling. The first trading day of the Brixton pound was on 18 September 2009 with 80 local businesses accepting the currency.

The Brixton pound aims to boost the local economy and build a mutual support system amongst independent businesses by tying local shoppers to local shops and by encouraging local shops to source goods and services locally. The notes are available in B£1, B£5, B£10, and B£20 denominations and depict local celebrities such as the community activist Olive Morris and the environmentalist James Lovelock. Lambeth Council has endorsed the project, which the New Economics Foundation helped to develop.

On 29 September 2011, the Brixton pound launched an electronic version of the currency where users can pay by text message. A second issue of the paper currency was launched, featuring a new set of well-known people with Brixton connections: On the B£1, the Black Cultural Archives founder Len Garrison, on the B£5, NBA basketball player Luol Deng (the reverse was inspired by the Ark Evelyn Grace Academy), David Bowie on the B£10 and World War II secret agent Violette Szabo on the B£20.

The reverse of the notes, designed by a Brixton creative agency This Ain&#x27;t Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll, feature notable local landmarks such as the Stockwell Skatepark, public art on Electric Avenue, Nuclear Dawn (one of the Brixton murals), and the Stirling Prize-winning Ark Evelyn Grace Academy. All four notes feature a design motif inspired by Coldharbour Lane&#x27;s Southwyck House (or &quot;Barrier Block&quot;).

In 2015, to celebrate the Brixton pound&#x27;s fifth anniversary, the Turner Prize-winning artist Jeremy Deller was commissioned to design a limited-edition B£5 note. It was described as &quot;psychedelic and political&quot;, with the front featuring bright colors and the back with a quotation from Karl Marx’s &quot;Das Kapital&quot; (&quot;Capital is money, capital is commodities...By virtue of it being value, it has acquired the occult ability to add value to itself. It brings forth living offspring, or, at the least, lays golden eggs.&quot;)

Other towns and cities in the UK that have used their own currency include the city of Bristol, Totnes in Devon, Stroud in Gloucestershire and Lewes in Sussex.

==Housing==

===Housing estates===

Brixton is home to several particularly large housing estates: Stockwell Park Estate off Stockwell and Brixton Roads respectively; Myatt&#x27;s Fields South and North off Vassall Road; Angell Town off Brixton Road on the boundary with Camberwell; Cowley on Cowley and Vassall Roads, Loughborough in the centre of Brixton, Tulse Hill estate, Somerleyton estate and Moorlands Estate, situated off Coldharbour Lane. There are also smaller estates such as Blenheim Gardens, Caldwell Gardens, Church Manor and Hertford. These estates account for a large part of the Brixton residence.

Estates like the Stockwell Park Estate and the Angell Town Estate were originally designed to accommodate high-level walkways which were envisaged to link the whole of Brixton. The ground-floor garages of these estates have proved to be a major security problem. The Somerleyton Estate is dominated by Southwyck House (known locally as &quot;Barrier Block&quot;), a large horseshoe-shaped brick and concrete 1970s structure that backs onto Coldharbour Lane. The 176-apartment block was originally constructed in this shape to provide a noise barrier against Ringway 1, a proposed inner-London motorway that was planned to pass through Brixton and Camberwell, later abandoned.
Some housing estates have been linked with urban decay and crime. New gates and iron bars have been constructed for the Loughborough Estate around Loughborough Road and Minet Road in response to a number of murders around the estate. The Loughborough Estate is home to more than 3,000 families and a mix of 1940s low-rise buildings and 1960s/1970s tower blocks and houses. Problems of urban decay have been reported around Loughborough Junction, the catchment area for Loughborough Estate, the Angell Town Estate and the Moorlands Estate.

===Victorian buildings===
Brixton still features some grand Victorian housing.

===Brixton Market===
Brixton Market is open every day, selling a range of African-Caribbean products and reflects other communities in the local area with Indian and Vietnamese supermarkets and South American butchers amongst the shops and stalls.. London Farmers&#x27; Markets opened a farmers market on Brixton Station Road in September 2009. It is open every Sunday from 9.30am to 2pm.

==Culture==

===Brixton murals===
After the riots in 1981 a series of murals were funded by the council. The murals portray nature, politics, community and ideas. The surviving murals include the Brixton Academy Mural (Stockwell Park Walk) by Stephen Pusey (1982) showing a mixed group of young people, intended to portray the natural harmony that could be found between children of mixed backgrounds in the local schools.

Recent contributions towards Brixton&#x27;s mural tradition include the portrait of Michael Johns on Popes Road by Dreph, created as part of Brixton Design Trail in September 2017 and the temporary installation of &quot;Remain, Thriving&quot; by Njideka Akunyili Crosby at Brixton tube station, a commission by Art on the Underground. In 2018 Dreph completed a large mural depicting Michelle Obama in Dorrell Place.

===Entertainment===
The Ritzy Cinema, Coldharbour Lane, is a formerly independent cinema now owned by Picturehouse Cinemas. The building was designed as the Electric Pavilion in 1910 by E. C. Homer and Lucas, one of England&#x27;s first purpose-built cinemas.

Brixton has a significant clubbing and live music scene. Large venues include Brixton Academy and Electric Brixton. A range of smaller venues such as The Windmill, Jamm, and Phonox are a major part of London&#x27;s live music scene. The Brixton Splash is an annual one-day street party held since 2006. The event is community run, showcasing local talent and celebrating the cultural diversity and history of Brixton.

=== Record shops ===
Brixton has had a number of popular record shops. Desmond&#x27;s Hip City on Atlantic Road existed from the 1970s until its closure in 1989. A record by the band Skydiggers; Desmond&#x27;s Hip City is named after the shop. In 2018, filmmaker Molly Dineen made a film about the owner of Blacker Dread Muzik Store called &quot;Being Blacker&quot;. Brixton&#x27;s current record shops include Supertone Records (opened in 1983) selling soundsystem reggae and Container Records which sells dance music.

=== Sport ===
Brixton is also home to a 1970s purpose-built skatepark, named Stockwell Skatepark, its own Dominoes team, the Brixton Immortals started by the community&#x27;s Windrush Generation and bicycle co-operative Brixton Cycles.

===Media===
Brixton is served by two local news blogs - Brixton Blog running since 2010 which also prints a monthly newspaper, and Brixton Buzz formed in 2011

===Radio===
Choice FM was an independent local radio station broadcasting from studios in Trinity Gardens from 1990 to 2004. It is now replaced by Capital XTRA. Reprezent Radio is a community radio station that broadcasts from Pop Brixton to the local area on 107.3FM. Brixton has always been served by a number of long-running community pirate radio stations including Lightning and Vibes FM.

==Religious sites==

===Christian churches===

Brixton lies within the Anglican Diocese of Southwark. The grade II*listed St Matthew&#x27;s Church, located on Brixton Green, was built in 1822 by the architect C. F. Porden in the Greek Revival style. It is one of the &quot;Waterloo churches&quot; built to celebrate Britain&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Waterloo.
St. Saviour&#x27;s Church was a location filming site of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; in 1955, identified in the film as Ambrose Chapel.

The 1868 parish church of St Jude, located on Dulwich Road, was designed by the architect John Kirk of Woolwich. It closed in 1975, and the parish merged with St Matthew&#x27;s. The church building is today used as business premises by a publishing company.

Christ Church on Brixton Road is an Art Nouveau and Byzantine-style Grade II* listed building built in 1902 by Beresford Pite, and St Paul&#x27;s church on Ferndale Road was originally built in 1958 as a Seventh-day Adventist church by John Soper.

Corpus Christi Church in Brixton comes under the remit of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark.

===Brixton Mosque===

The Masjid ibn Taymeeyah, or Brixton Mosque and Islamic Cultural Centre, is located in Gresham Road, close to Brixton Police Station. The mosque has facilities for both men and women and space for 400 worshippers during prayer. Opened in 1990, it is one of the oldest mosques in south London. The mosque provides religious, social and financial support to its members.

The mosque made international headlines when it was reported that Richard Reid, the so-called &quot;shoe bomber&quot;, had attended the mosque. Abdul Haqq Baker, chairman of Brixton Mosque, told the BBC that Reid came to the mosque to learn about Islam but soon fell in with what he called &quot;more extreme elements&quot;. Zacarias Moussaoui, who was convicted of conspiring to kill citizens of the US as part of 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks, made his initial steps into radical indoctrination in Brixton Mosque, where he met Reid, though he was expelled from the mosque after he turned up wearing combat fatigues and a backpack, and pressured the cleric to give him information on joining the &quot;jihad&quot;. Abdullah el-Faisal, a radical Muslim cleric who preached in the UK until imprisoned for stirring up hatred and later deported to Jamaica in 2007, was associated with the Brixton Mosque and began preaching to crowds of up to 500 people, but was ousted by its Salafi administration in 1993. Afterward, he gave a lecture he called &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Deception of the Saudi Salafis&quot;, scorning the Salafi Muslims (especially the members of the Brixton Mosque), calling them hypocrites and apostates (&quot;takfir&quot;).

===Brixton Synagogue===
Brixton Synagogue at 49 Effra Road opened in 1913 and closed in 1986, with the congregation then amalgamating with the nearby Streatham Synagogue. The front of the building still exists.

==Governance==

Brixton town centre is divided between four wards of Lambeth Council.

*Coldharbour ward – east of Brixton Road/Effra Road and south of Loughborough Road
*Ferndale ward – north of Acre Lane and west of Brixton Road
*Tulse Hill ward – east of Brixton Hill as far as Effra Road/Norwood Road.

The area south of Brixton Water Lane and including Brockwell Park is in Herne Hill ward

==Policing, drugs and crime==

===Operation Swamp===

Before the 1981 riot was the centre of &quot;Operation Swamp 81&quot; aimed at reducing street crime mainly through the heavy use of the so-called sus law, which allowed police to stop and search individuals on the basis of a &quot;suspicion&quot; of wrongdoing. Plainclothes police officers were dispatched into Brixton, and in five days almost 1,000 people were stopped and searched. The local community was not consulted about the operation and tensions between the black community and the police on the streets of Brixton reached breaking point. Local residents complained about young, inexperienced police officers being sent on the streets, provoking confrontation.

===Gang culture===

In 2003 &quot;The Independent&quot; reported that around 200 &quot;hardcore Yardies&quot; are based in Lambeth, some operating as members of &quot;Firehouse Posse&quot; or Brixton&#x27;s &quot;Kartel Crew&quot;. Yardies were historically associated with Jamaican immigrants and had a recognised stronghold in Brixton. Parts of Brixton were referred to as &quot;Little Tivoli&quot; after &quot;Tivoli Gardens&quot;, a notorious &quot;garrison community&quot; in Jamaica ruled by gunmen. In 1999 a scandal broke over Metropolitan Police detectives allowing two known Jamaican Yardies to stay in Britain as an intelligence tool. Eaton Green, one of the Yardies, escaped bail in Jamaica in 1991 and settled in Brixton, dealing in crack cocaine. Three months later Green was arrested by a Brixton constable, Steve Barker, and became a paid informer. Green provided intelligence about Yardie activity for two years, continuing the use of firearms and the dealing of crack throughout this time.

Several gangs are headquartered in the Brixton area. The &quot;Murderzone&quot; (MZ) gang, which is involved in illegal drug dealing, hail from the Somerleyton Estate. The &quot;Poverty Driven Children&quot;/&quot;Peel Dem Crew&quot; (PDC) are located in the Angell Town and Loughborough Junction area. &quot;Organised Crime&quot; (OC), a gang linked with various shootings and an ongoing rivalry with the Peckham Boys, are based in the Myatts Field Estate. GAS Gang, which stands for &quot;Guns and Shanks&quot;, &quot;Grind and Stack&quot;, &quot;Grip and Shoot&quot;, or &quot;Gangsters Always Shoot&quot;, was located mainly in Angell Town.

In 2011, five of the most prominent members of the GAS Gang—Ricardo Giddings, Helder Demorais, Jamal Moore, Shaquille Haughton and Kyle Kinghorn—were sentenced to a total of 76 years in prison for the murder of rival gang member, fifteen-year-old Zac Olumegbon.

Members of local gangs are mostly in their late teens or early 20s, with gang leaders usually being childhood friends. Brought up in some of London&#x27;s poorest areas some gang members reportedly move from house to house on an almost nightly basis, making it hard to track them. According to the Metropolitan Police, these youth gangs are far from organised criminal masterminds; however, they continue to evade the police and have been responsible for numerous offences of homicide. Operation Trident officers stated that it is a &quot;struggle&quot; to persuade local people to testify, because of fear of reprisals. Trident officers stated that some gang members were &quot;inept at handling powerful guns&quot;, and that gangs have machine guns, in 9 mm. According to the detective many of the deactivated guns are shipped in from the Balkans and then reactivated. Brixton has been noted as one of the most significant origins of UK drill.

===Drugs===
Some media commentators persistently call Brixton &quot;the drugs capital of London&quot;. Val Shawcross, Labour representative on the London Assembly for Lambeth and Southwark, runs a &quot;Brixton Drug Crime&quot; campaign and she states on her website:
I have been raising the disgraceful state of Brixton and the existence of an open drugs market in the centre – with the Council, Mayor and the Metropolitan police... The police, the Drugs and Firearms Unit and Transport Operational Unit officers have been undertaking long-term surveillance of the area (Brixton Town Centre) culminating in a three-day operation at the end of June to arrest those dealing Class A drugs... The police will be carrying out continuing covert operations in Brixton and patrolling with drug detection dogs. This is a long-term crackdown with the aim on cleaning the dealers out of Brixton.(retrieved July 2008)

For many decades, Brixton has had a reputation for cannabis use and the BBC has quoted a local resident as saying &quot;People have always smoked cannabis in Brixton – everyone knows that, people have walked down the street smoking spliffs for years.&quot; This reputation was amplified by the &quot;softly softly&quot; police approach to cannabis that was piloted in Brixton in 2001 to 2005. Concerns were raised about &quot;drug tourism&quot; to the area. The &quot;softly-softly&quot; pilot occurred in the context of a wider debate in Britain about the classification of cannabis. Despite the pilot being stopped and replaced by a &quot;no deal&quot; policy, the Metropolitan Police was in favour of a reclassification of cannabis from class B to class C. Cannabis was officially reclassified in Britain from a class B down to a class C drug in early 2004. In January 2009 the UK government reclassified cannabis back to a class B drug.

===JayDay Cannabis Festival===
From 2001 to 2004, Brockwell Park hosted the annual Cannabis Festival, or JayDay, organised by the Cannabis Coalition. The police reportedly maintained a low profile, tolerating the smoking of cannabis. In 2005 the London Borough of Lambeth rejected the application for a further Cannabis Festival on the following grounds:

While Lambeth Council supports freedom of speech and the right to take part in a legitimate campaign, the council cannot condone illegal activities such as cannabis use and drug pushing – both of which have taken place at a previous festival held by the Cannabis Coalition. Indeed council officers monitoring the event in the past were approached by drug dealers who offered them drugs.
===Brian Paddick===
In 2001, Brian Paddick, then Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, became subject of newspaper headlines due to the implementation of a pilot cannabis programme in Brixton, also known as the &quot;softly softly&quot; approach, as well as his posts made on the Brixton-based Urban75 internet forum. Police officers were instructed not to arrest or charge people who were found to be in possession of cannabis. They were instead to issue on-the-spot warnings and confiscate the drugs. Although Paddick is credited with the idea, the pilot programme was sanctioned by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, Sir John Stevens. Paddick asserts that he implemented the policy because he wanted his officers to deal with cannabis quickly and informally so that they could concentrate on heroin and crack cocaine offences, and street robbery and burglary, which were affecting the quality of life in Lambeth to a greater extent. The pilot was ended December 2005 and was replaced by a so-called &quot;no deal&quot; policy on cannabis in Brixton following complaints about increasing numbers of dealers openly selling the drug.

Paddick had been a sergeant on the front line during the 1981 Brixton riot, an experience which shaped his attitudes about confrontational police action and strengthened his belief in community policing. In December 2000 he was appointed Police Commander for Lambeth, where he worked until December 2002, fulfilling his ambition of becoming head of policing in Brixton. Paddick gained much support from the local community for his approach to policing and addressed a rally in his support in March 2002, leading Dominic Casciani from the BBC to comment:
If someone had said just five years ago that black, white, young and old, straight and gay, liberal and anarchist would all be standing together giving a standing ovation to a police commander in Brixton, people might have said they had smoked one spliff too many.

===Gun crime===
In June 1998, gun crime in Brixton was reported on widely in connection with the linked murders of Avril Johnson and Michelle Carby, in Brixton and Stratford respectively. Both women were shot in their homes in separate, but connected, attacks; in addition, both victims were shot in the head. In 2008 Tony Thompson, a former &quot;Time Out&quot; news editor, reported that &quot;Gun crime began to escalate following a series of south London gang executions in the late 1990s.&quot; Thompson states that &quot;Previous Met operations were seen as putting down the black community. Trident, from the start, was intelligence-led and had strong links with the black community.&quot;

In 2001 the Metropolitan Police raised concerns over rapidly increasing gun crime in London. At the time Lambeth had the highest rate of robberies in London. In July 2001 two armed police officers shot dead black 29-year-old Derek Bennett in Brixton, Angell Town Estate, after Bennett brandished a gun-shaped cigarette lighter. The verdict of the subsequent inquest ruled that Bennett had been &quot;lawfully killed&quot;, the verdict was upheld in a subsequent appeal.

In December 2004 Operation Trident officers and armed officers were assisting Lambeth police in a number of stop and search operations targeting &quot;suspected gunmen or vehicles that have been associated with firearms&quot; and called &quot;Operation Trident Swoop&quot; by the police. The Metropolitan Police hoped that &quot;the searches will deter suspects from carrying weapons and prevent shootings taking place, as well as possibly recovering weapons and leading to arrests.&quot; Superintendent Jerry Savill, Lambeth Police has responsibility for policing in the Brixton area, stated:
This operation is aimed very specifically at people we have information to suggest may be involved in gun crime or other offences. We want to send out a very clear message to those who carry guns in Lambeth, don&#x27;t. It is time to stop the vast majority of people in this borough feeling afraid to be on the street and make it the gunmen who are fearful of their community helping the police to arrest them.
In September 2006 Brixton was the scene of a widely reported shooting, involving two boys being shot in the packed McDonald&#x27;s on Brixton Road/Acre Lane.

In 2007 firearm offences rose by 4 per cent in London, totalling 3,459 &quot;gun-enabled&quot; crimes, including 30 gun murders of which nine victims were aged 18 or under. A series of gun crimes in the Brixton, Clapham and Streatham, including the Murders of three boys in one week, led some media commentators to call the area &quot;gun capital&quot;.

<text>Brockley is a district and an electoral ward of south London, England, in the London Borough of Lewisham south-east of Charing Cross. It has been named the best area of London to live in. It is an area rich in Victorian and Edwardian domestic architecture, historic trees and original lanes and mews. This is protected by a conservation area and the Brockley Society. It has a strong community and numerous popular cafes and restaurants. The station is on both the mainline railway and the Windrush Line. The London Borough of Lewisham&#x27;s Draft Local Implementation Plan 2019-41 proposes linking the station to the Victoria to Dartford line which crosses Brockley station by 2030.

==History==

The name Brockley is derived from &quot;Broca&#x27;s woodland clearing&quot;, a wood where badgers are seen (&quot;broc&quot; is the Old English for badger) or Brook (Stream) by a wood (Ley). In the late 12th century, a small Premonstratensian house was founded there, before being transferred to Bayham (Sussex) in 1208. 

Formerly part of the county of Kent, Brockley fell into both the Metropolitan Borough of Lewisham and the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford in the County of London from 1900. The division was roughly around Hilly Fields, with the area to the north falling within Deptford. Brockley was subsequently reunified with the creation of Greater London in 1965 under the London Borough of Lewisham, which incorporated the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford. 

Brockley has its origins in a small agricultural hamlet of the same name located in the area of the &quot;Brockley Jack&quot; (rebuilt 1895), a large public house that today houses the Brockley Jack Theatre. Brockley Hall (demolished 1931) stood nearby and now gives its name to a road on a 1930s housing estate. Crofton Park railway station was built nearby in 1892 by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. 

Brockley railway station opened on 6 March 1871 and is currently served by London Overground and Southern in Travelcard Zone 2. As is often the case in London, the location of the station defines the geography of the district and areas to the north and west of Brockley Station, previously considered as Hatcham, New Cross, Telegraph Hill (SE14) and St Johns (SE8), are now considered Brockley. Ordnance Survey maps of Brockley up to the 1940s tend to centre on the location of the Jack, the Hall, and Crofton Park railway station, but recent maps are now more centred on Brockley Station and nearby areas, such as with the electoral ward map demarcating Brockley. While the name Crofton Park was invented by the railway company, it was given official sanction with the naming of Crofton Park Library, a fine arts and crafts building, in 1905, and is now the name of an electoral ward to the south.

The oldest surviving house in the area of what is now considered to be the northern extent of Brockley is the &quot;Stone House&quot; on Lewisham Way (opposite LeSoCo) built in 1773 by the architect George Gibson the Younger. which is a Grade II* Listed building and was historically considered to be in Deptford.

Brockley market gardens were famous for their enormous Victoria rhubarb which were fertilised by &#x27;night soil&#x27; from London. There were orchards too and some ancient fruit trees survive in local gardens. Until the late 19th century a small river flowed northward from Crofton Park and east of Malpas Rd to join the River Thames via Deptford Creek. It is now covered over.

Industrial development arrived in 1809 in the form of the Croydon Canal running from Croydon to Bermondsey. This was later filled in and replaced by the London &amp; Croydon railway which runs through the original canal cutting between Brockley (opened in 1871) and New Cross Gate stations. Some of the oldest houses in Brockley are the cottages and shops which form a small terrace on Coulgate Street, just east of Brockley station. These are believed to date from 1833 and were probably originally associated with the canal. 
From 1872 until 1917, Brockley Lane railway station provided access to the Greenwich Park branch line and the remains of the old station entrance are still visible at Brockley Cross.

In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Tyrwhitt-Drake family developed the north side of Brockley with grand villas, large terraces and semi-detached houses (Tyrwhitt Road and Drake Road are named after the family). Development started south of Lewisham Way in the late 1840s with the modest cottages at 2–22 Upper Brockley Rd and spread south and east towards Hilly Fields. In 1900 Chalsey Rd was the last road to be completed within the current conservation area. However, open farmland remained south of Brockley Grove and west of the railway line into the early 1930s.

Many grand houses in Brockley were occupied by the owners and managers of factories in neighbouring industrial areas such as Deptford and Bermondsey. At 63 Breakspears Road lived Edwin Watts, owner of &#x27;ER Watts and Son&#x27;, a mathematical instrument making company in Camberwell Road. Charles Booth&#x27;s Map of London Poverty (1900) describes the residents of Wickham Road and Breakspears Road as &quot;well-to-do&quot; or &quot;wealthy&quot;. The actress Lillie Langtry was one notable resident during this period. The terraced streets west of Brockley Rd were more mixed: &quot;comfortable and poor&quot;. The artist/poet David Jones, whose father was a printer, grew up in Howson Road. Some of David Jones&#x27;s paintings and illustrations depict his parents&#x27; house and garden. The writer Henry Williamson, the son of a bank clerk, was born in nearby Braxfield Road.

Brockley contains several fine churches: St Mary Magdalen&#x27;s RC Church, Howson Road (completed in 1901), St Peter&#x27;s, Wickham Rd (completed 1870), the Grade II listed St Andrews, Brockley Rd (1882) – originally a Presbyterian Church, which contains the modern stained glass New Cross Fire memorial window (2002) – and the Grade II listed St Hilda&#x27;s, Crofton Park 1908. The latter was designed by J E Newberry in the Arts and Crafts movement style and still contains its original interior.

After World War I, Brockley began to lose its exclusivity as the wealthy began to relocate to the outer suburbs and the big houses were increasingly sub-divided into multiple occupation. The typical inter-war houses on Upper Brockley Gardens and on Harefield Rd are clearly more modest than their Victorian neighbours. Small industrial workshops also became established in the mews behind the large houses.

The Grade II listed Rivoli Ballroom (originally a cinema) dates from 1913 but was remodeled as a dance hall in 1951. It has a unique and outstanding interior, which has featured in many films, videos and fashion shoots. In 2007 The White Stripes rock band played a secret gig here. Other notable live performances include those by Florence + the Machine (2009, 2012) and Damon Albarn (2014). The building has recently been listed (2007) and is now protected from demolition.

Being under the bomber flight path to the London docks, the area suffered significant V-2 rocket and other bomb damage in World War II. The post-war blocks of council flats at the south end of Wickham Rd and at the west end of Adelaide Avenue are evidence of this. During the Second World War, an anti-aircraft gun emplacement was located on Hilly Fields.

===Since World War II===
After the Second World War, most of the big houses were sub-divided into multiple occupation. In the 1950s and 1960s these houses provided accommodation for the recently arrived African-Caribbean population, many of whom found employment in nearby Deptford. In 1948, five passengers bound for England from Jamaica on the ship Empire Windrush gave Wickham Road as their intended destination on arrival in London. Other migrants came from Turkey, Cyprus, Italy and South Asia (especially Sri Lanka). In the period 1945–60s it was very difficult to get a bank loan to purchase a pre-1914-built property, hence the frequent subdivision of the larger older houses during this period.

From the mid-1960s artists (some associated with nearby Goldsmiths College) started to move into the large and at the time neglected houses on Manor Avenue, beginning the process of &#x27;gentrification&#x27; which continues today. Much of north Brockley was designated a Conservation Area in 1974 and in the same year the Brockley Society was formed with the aim of preserving and protecting the character of the area. Brockley is today one of the best preserved and most coherent Victorian suburbs in Inner London and contains examples of almost every style of mid- to late 19th century-domestic architecture from vast Gothic Revival piles to modest workmen&#x27;s cottages. There are also mews behind some of the streets such as Ashby Mews and Wickham Mews. This range of 19th-century architectural styles makes Brockley unusual.
The extension of the East London Line, now part of the London Overground network, opened in May 2010. It connects Brockley with north London and is encouraging new residential development around Brockley station.

In 2000 the Brockley Cross Action Group was set up with the aim of influencing the regeneration of the Brockley Cross area and has been instrumental in the restoration of Brockley Common and the greening of several other derelict sites.

==Green space==

Brockley contains several attractive open spaces, amongst them Blythe Hill, Brockley and Ladywell Cemeteries (opened in 1858 and now a nature reserve) and Hilly Fields. The latter was saved from development by the Commons Preservation Society and local groups in the 1880s and 1890s (including Octavia Hill, one of the founders of the National Trust). In 1896, after being bought with the proceeds of private donations and funding from the London County Council, the fields were transformed from old brickpits and ditches into a park. The park became a regular meeting place for the Suffragette movement between 1907 and 1914.

The old West Kent Grammar School (later renamed Brockley County Grammar School), now Prendergast Hilly Fields College, a Grade II* listed building, is situated at the top of the hill. The School hall contains the &#x27;Brockley murals&#x27;. Dating from 1932 to 1935 by Charles Mahoney, Evelyn Dunbar and other students of the Royal College of Art, they are considered some of the best examples in the country of the Neo-Romantic style and illustrate many local scenes.

Close by, a stone circle was erected in 2000 as a millennium project by a group of local artists, which won a Civic Trust Award in 2002. The Hilly Fields Midsummer Fayre has been running for over 30 years and is a much celebrated annual community event. At 160 ft above sea level, Hilly Fields has wide views from Canary Wharf and Shooters Hill to Crystal Palace and the North Downs in Kent.

West of the railway between Brockley and New Cross Gate railway stations lies the Brockley Nature Reserve (formerly known as New Cross Gate Cutting Nature Reserve). This ten acre woodland is home to over 30 species of birds including greater spotted woodpecker and sparrowhawk. The reserve is managed by London Wildlife Trust, access (when open) is from the entrance on Vesta Road. Gorne Wood is a three acre piece of ancient woodland, the closest such piece of land to the City of London.

==The arts in Brockley==
Like its neighbour Telegraph Hill, Brockley has a reputation as a focus for the arts in South London. The mid-1960s saw the beginning of a &#x27;bohemian&#x27; influx of artists, musicians and alternative types attracted by the neglected and (at the time very cheap) Victorian houses and vast rambling gardens and the close proximity to Goldsmiths College and Camberwell School of Art. Many artists have built studios in their back gardens and the annual &#x27;open studios&#x27; weekend is a good opportunity to visit some of these.

The Lewisham Art House, housed in a grand Edwardian building (which was formerly Deptford Library) on Lewisham Way, provides art classes, studio and exhibition space. The Grade II listed library building is a Carnegie Library, made possible by the philanthropy of the industrialist Andrew Carnegie. It opened in 1914 and was designed by Sir Alfred Brumwell Thomas. The Brockley Jack Theatre has recently been refurbished and has a high reputation for performances of new plays and is the home of the Brockley Jack Film Club. Each summer local artists host a thriving Brockley Open Studios weekend. Since 2004 Brockley has also hosted the Brockley Max performing arts festival involving many local musicians and singers. In 2015, the neighbourhood hosted the first annual Brockley Street Art Festival, which saw the creation of more than twenty high quality murals in the area.

==Politics==
Brockley ward is represented by three Labour councillors as of the 2022 election.

All of Brockley Ward&#x27;s three councillors were from the Green Party and combined with neighbouring Ladywell ward, Lewisham Council had six Green Party councillors; one of the highest number of Green party councillors in the UK. However, in the 2010 Local Elections, held at the same time as the 2010 General Election, the Green party lost all but one of their seats. The remaining seat was held by Darren Johnson in Brockley. In the 2014 Council elections the Green Party retained one of Brockley&#x27;s council seats, which is held by Councillor John Coughlin.

A proposal to create a new Brockley Interchange, linking the existing station to the to Lewisham line with new platforms at the former Brockley Lane station, is included in the London Borough of Lewisham&#x27;s 2019–2041 transport strategy. The document gives an approximate date of 2030 and states that funding from TfL and Network Rail would be needed for the project. The document states that TFL is to provide an estimated cost.

==In popular culture==
Linton Kwesi Johnson mentions Brockley in his poem &quot;Inglan Is A Bitch&quot; (1980). He spells it &quot;Brackly&quot; as this is roughly how it sounds in Jamaican patois:

:&quot;&quot;dem a have a lickle facktri up inna Brackly&quot;
:&quot;inna disya facktri all dem dhu is pack crackry&quot;
:&quot;fi di laas fifteen years dem get mi laybah&quot;
:&quot;now awftah fifteen years mi fall out a fayvah&quot;&quot;

The musician Nick Nicely&#x27;s 1982 cult psychedelic track &quot;Hilly Fields&quot; was inspired by the park of the same name.

Two early novels by Henry Williamson (who lived on Eastern Road) describe Brockley in great detail, as it was in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

Edgar Wallace&#x27;s fictional 1920s detective J. G. Reeder lived in Brockley Road. Wallace himself lived in Tressillian Crescent, Brockley, for over 30 years. His book &quot;The Duke in the Suburbs&quot; is also based in Brockley.

&quot;The Picturegoers&quot;, the first novel by David Lodge, is set in and around a rundown cinema in 1950s Brockley; thinly disguised as &#x27;Brickley&#x27;.

Blake Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;South of the River&quot; (2007) is set in Brockley.

Colin Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;The Outsider&quot; (1956) opens with a reference to Brockley.

In 2003, the BBC1 documentary &quot;Worlds Apart&quot; showed two contrasting Brockley families living within yards of each other; one in a small council flat, the other in a large house.

The Rivoli Ballroom has featured in numerous films, TV shows and fashion shoots, and was used for the debut album launch for Florence and the Machine, the video for Tina Turner&#x27;s Private Dancer and a secret gig by The White Stripes.

The Metros&#x27; song &quot;Last of the Lookers&quot; from their 2008 album &quot;More Money Less Grief&quot; mentions meeting a girl who is later found out not to be from their native Brockley.

Laura Wilson, the series&#x27; narrator and protagonist of ongoing comic book series The Wicked and the Divine lives in Brockley at the start of the series.

<text>Brondesbury (), which includes Brondesbury Park, is an area of Kilburn in the London Boroughs of Brent and Camden, in north London, England. The area is traditionally part of the ancient parish and subsequent municipal borough of Willesden, one of the areas that merged to form the modern borough of Brent.

Brondesbury railway station lies 4.1 miles north-west of Charing Cross, and its proximity to the originally Roman A5 road (the borough&#x27;s eastern boundary) sometimes leads to addresses on the eastern, Camden, side of the road to also be informally described as part of Brondesbury.

It was a rural area until several decades after the coming of the railway in the Victorian era. Housing began to be built in earnest across Brondesbury in the late 1860s to 1890s and it became desirable enough to retain a suburban layout and most of the associated original wave of house building. It has long had British, Irish, Jewish, black and South Asian communities. Brondesbury was once the location of residence for Black civil rights leader Billy Strachan and his family, who wrote for local newspapers gave weekly political speeches in the area.

==History==
===Manor and manor house===
Willesden parish, which included Durand&#x27;s estate at Twyford and Harlesden manor, was divided between eight variable, ecclesiastical prebends: East Twyford in the south-west, Neasden in the north-west, Oxgate in the northeast, Harlesden in the centre and south, and Chambers, Brondesbury, Bounds, and Mapesbury in the east.

The manor Brondesbury, Brands or Broomsbury almost certainly derived its name from Brand (seen in documents of about 1192 and 1215), sometimes confused with Brownswood in Hornsey of Roger Brun listed as prebendary of Brondesbury. The estate was held by the prebendaries until it was vested in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners in 1840 under the Act of that year. In 1649 the parliamentary commissioners sold it to Ralph Marsh but it reverted at the Restoration (1660). The leasehold interest of Brondesbury was bought with what remained too of Bounds manor in 1856 and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners retained the freehold until the 1950s and 1960s.

Forty-year leases were made of Brondesbury to William Peter, gentleman of London, in 1538 and to Thomas Young, a Willesden yeoman, in reversion in 1566. In the first decade of the 17th century Young&#x27;s widow and his daughter lived here. In 1615 the latter, Christian&#x27;s estranged husband, Henry Shugborow, brought an action for possession against the executors, who had re-entered because the rent had not been paid and it had been sublet to one Marsh, &#x27;an ancient tenant&#x27;. The estate was leased for lives in 1638 to Edward Roberts but Ralph Marsh, who in 1649 bought Brondesbury from the parliamentary commissioners, seems to have occupied the land. Thomas and Ralph Marsh were described as &quot;of Brands&quot; in 1679 and 1694 respectively. Ralph Marsh (d. 1709) in 1708 received a lease for lives. The estate was heavily mortgaged by the Marshes from 1725 and in 1749 Ralph Marsh sold the lease to John Stace, who obtained a new lease in 1757. Stace sold the lease in 1765 to Joseph Gibson, the undertenant, who obtained a new lease in 1769 and whose widow and son tried to sell the estate in 1778. In 1788 Lady (Sarah) Salusbury purchased the leasehold, and in 1799 she obtained a new lease for lives. Brondesbury thereafter passed through the same ownership as Bounds, Lady Salusbury obtaining possession (all other competing leases rendered inferior) in 1842.

A moated house as the manor house existed by 1538. It was described in 1649, probably with the remnants of the moat, and was depicted in 1749 as a large, apparently L-shaped building with a central cupola. It appears to have been rebuilt in the third quarter of the 18th century and by the time of Lady (Sarah) Salusbury was a three-storeyed villa with a central canted entrance bay rising the full height of the north front. A lower wing, presumably an addition, ran southward from the east end. In 1789 Humphry Repton landscaped roughly of demesne grounds and William Wilkins supplied drawings for a Gothic seat. In his &#x27;Red Book&#x27; Repton commented favourably on the hilltop site and enhanced the view towards London. The house and 23 acres, increased by 1834 to 53 acres, was occupied by Sir Coutts Trotter, Bt. (1804–36), Lady Trotter (1836–40), Lady (Elizabeth) Salusbury (1840-3), and Charles Hambro (1843-9). The house was extended westward and a semicircular bay was added to the south front in the early 19th century. By 1849 the demesne fell to 27 acres and the house, described in 1816 as being commodious yet having &#x27;no regularity of architectural character&#x27; and in 1822 as an &#x27;elegant seat&#x27;, three-storeyed. It continued as a gentleman&#x27;s residence under Mrs. Howard (1850-3), Henry Vallence (1853-6), Mrs. Geach (1856–61), John Coverdale (1862-7), and Thomas Brandon (1867–76), and in 1877 was offered for sale with 52 acres. After remaining empty it was leased as a school, to Margaret Clark (1882–98) and Lucy Soulsby (1898-1915). In 1891 the school added a classroom and dormitory block on the east and later a chapel beyond that. The house continued as a school until 1934 when, described as &#x27;shabby-looking&#x27;, it was bought by C. W. B. Simmonds, a builder, and was pulled down to make way for Manor Drive.

The Imperial Gazetteer of 1870-72 reads:

==In art, literature, film and the media==
Giles, Giles &amp; Fripp, the forerunner to the band King Crimson, at its most successful in 1969–1974, named an album &quot;The Brondesbury Tapes&quot;.

<text>Camberwell ( ) is an area of South London, England, in the London Borough of Southwark, southeast of Charing Cross.

Camberwell was first a village associated with the church of St Giles and a common of which Goose Green is a remnant. This early parish included the neighbouring hamlets of Peckham, Dulwich, Nunhead, and part of Herne Hill (the rest of Herne Hill was in the parish of Lambeth). Until 1889, it was part of the county of Surrey. In 1900 the original parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell.

In 1965, most of the Borough of Camberwell was merged into the London Borough of Southwark. To the west, part of both West Dulwich and Herne Hill come under the London Borough of Lambeth.

The place now known as Camberwell covers a much smaller area than the ancient parish, and it is bound on the north by Walworth; on the south by East Dulwich and Herne Hill; to the west by Kennington; and on the east by Peckham.

==History==

Camberwell appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Cambrewelle&quot;. The name may derive from the Old English Cumberwell or Comberwell, meaning &#x27;Well of the Britons&#x27;, referring to remaining Celtic inhabitants of an area dominated by Anglo-Saxons. An alternative theory suggests the name may mean &#x27;Cripple Well&#x27;, and that the settlement developed as a hamlet where people from the City of London were expelled when they had a contagious disease like leprosy, for treatment by the church and the clean, healing waters from the wells. Springs and wells are known to have existed on the southern slope of Denmark Hill, especially around Grove Park.

It was already a substantial settlement with a church when mentioned in the Domesday Book, and was the parish church for a large area including Dulwich and Peckham. It was held by Haimo the Sheriff (of Kent). Its Domesday assets were: 6 hides and 1 virgate (i.e. ); 1 church, 8 ploughs, of meadow, woodland worth 60 hogs. It rendered £14. Up to the mid-19th century, Camberwell was visited by Londoners for its rural tranquillity and the reputed healing properties of its mineral springs. Like much of inner South London, Camberwell was transformed by the arrival of the railways in the 1860s. Camberwell Green is now a very small area of common land; it was once a traditional village green on which was held an annual fair, of ancient origin, which rivalled that of Greenwich.

There is evidence of a black community residing in Camberwell, made up mostly of enslaved people from Africa and North America during the 18th and 19th centuries. Some of these people fled their slavery in an attempt to create a new life for themselves in the streets of London. While very little is known about most of the escapees, some insight can be gained into the life of sailor James Williams, an enslaved man from the Caribbean.
===Local government===
====The parish of Camberwell====
&quot;Camberwell St Giles&quot; is the name given to an ancient, and later civil, parish in the Brixton hundred of Surrey. The parish covered in 1831 and was divided into the liberty of Peckham to the east and the hamlet of Dulwich to the southwest, as well as Camberwell proper. The parish tapered in the south to form a point in what is now known as the Crystal Palace area. In 1801, the population was 7,059 and by 1851 this had risen to 54,667. In 1829, it was included in the Metropolitan Police District and in 1855 it was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works, with Camberwell Vestry nominating one member to the board. In 1889 the board was replaced by the London County Council and Camberwell was removed administratively from Surrey to form part of the County of London.

====The Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell====
In 1900, the area of the Camberwell parish became the Metropolitan Borough of Camberwell. In 1965, the metropolitan borough was abolished and its former area became the southern part of the London Borough of Southwark in Greater London. The western part of the area is situated in the adjacent London Borough of Lambeth.

===Industrial history===
The area has historically been home to many factories, including R. White&#x27;s Lemonade, which originated in Camberwell, as well as Dualit toasters. Neither of these companies is now based in the area.

===Former schools===
Wilson&#x27;s School was founded in 1615 in Camberwell by royal charter by Edward Wilson, vicar of the Parish of Camberwell. The charter was granted by James I. The school moved to its current site in Croydon in 1975. A school for girls, Mary Datchelor Girls&#x27; School, was established in Camberwell in 1877. It was built on two houses at 15 and 17 Grove Lane, the location of a former manor house. All except one of its 30 pupils came from the parish of St Andrew Undershaft in the City of London. The funding for the school came from a bequest from Mary Datchelor, who died childless. Proceeds of a property in Threadneedle Street used as a coffee-house were used to pay for apprenticeships for the poor boys of the parish, but as demographics in the City changed, it was decided to set up a school. By the 1970s, the school was receiving funding from the Clothworkers&#x27; Company and the Inner London Education Authority funded teaching posts. The school came under pressure from ILEA to become co-educational and comprehensive. Faced with this choice or becoming fully private, the school&#x27;s governors instead decided to close in 1981. The school buildings were later used as offices for the charity Save the Children but have now been converted to flats. Camberwell Collegiate School
was an independent school located on the eastern side of Camberwell Grove, directly opposite the Grove Chapel. The Collegiate College had some success for a while, and led to the closure for some decades of the Denmark Hill Grammar School. However it had difficulty competing with other nearby schools including Dulwich College, and was closed in 1867.The land was sold for building.

==Important buildings==
Camberwell today is a mixture of relatively well preserved Georgian and 20th-century housing, including a number of tower blocks. Camberwell Grove, Grove Lane and Addington Square have some of London&#x27;s most elegant and well-preserved Georgian houses.

The Salvation Army&#x27;s William Booth Memorial Training College, designed by Giles Gilbert Scott, was completed in 1932: it towers over South London from Denmark Hill. It has a similar monumental impressiveness to Gilbert Scott&#x27;s other local buildings, Battersea Power Station and the Tate Modern, although its simplicity is partly the result of repeated budget cuts during its construction: much more detail, including carved Gothic stonework surrounding the windows, was originally planned. Camberwell is home to one of London&#x27;s largest teaching hospitals, King&#x27;s College Hospital with associated medical school the Guy&#x27;s King&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; (GKT) School of Medicine. The Maudsley Hospital, an internationally significant psychiatric hospital, is located in Camberwell along with the Institute of Psychiatry.

Early music halls in Camberwell were in the back hall of public houses. One, the &quot;Father Redcap&quot; (1853) still stands by Camberwell Green, but internally, much altered. In 1896, the Dan Leno company opened the &quot;Oriental Palace of Varieties&quot;, on Denmark Hill. This successful venture was soon replaced with a new theatre, designed by Ernest A.E. Woodrow and with a capacity of 1,553, in 1899, named the &quot;Camberwell Palace&quot;. This was further expanded by architect Lewen Sharp in 1908. By 1912, the theatre was showing films as a part of the variety programme and became an ABC cinema in September 1932 – known simply as &quot;The Palace Cinema&quot;. It reopened as a variety theatre in 1943, but closed on 28 April 1956 and was demolished.

Nearby, marked by Orpheus Street, was the &quot;Metropole Theatre and Opera House&quot;, presenting transfers of West End shows. This was demolished to build an Odeon cinema in 1939. The cinema seated 2,470, and has since been demolished. A second ABC cinema, known originally as the Regal Cinema and later as the ABC Camberwell, opened in 1940. With only one screen but 2,470 seats, the cinema was one of the largest suburban cinemas in London and continued to operate until 1973, after which it was used as a bingo hall until February 2010. The building retains its Art Deco style and is Grade II listed.

The Church of the Sacred Heart, Camberwell has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since 2015. Camberwell Town Hall, designed by Culpin and Bowers, was completed in 1934.

On 3 July 2009 a major fire swept through Lakanal House, a twelve-storey tower block. Six people were killed and at least 20 people were injured.

==Camberwell beauty==

The Camberwell beauty (also Camberwell Beauty) is a butterfly (&quot;Nymphalis antiopa&quot;) which is rarely found in the UK – it is so named because two examples were first identified on Coldharbour Lane, Camberwell in 1748. A large mosaic of the Camberwell beauty used to adorn the Samuel Jones paper factory on Southampton Way. The paper factory has since been demolished but the mosaic was removed and re-installed on the side of Lynn Boxing Club on Wells Way.

==Culture==
===Art===

Camberwell has several art galleries including Camberwell College of Arts, the South London Gallery and numerous smaller commercial art spaces. There is an annual Camberwell Arts Festival in the summer. The Blue Elephant Theatre on Bethwin Road is the only theatre venue in Camberwell.

A group now known as the YBAs (the Young British Artists) began in Camberwell – in the Millard building of Goldsmiths&#x27; College on Cormont Road. A former training college for women teachers, the Millard was the home of Goldsmiths Fine Art and Textiles department until 1988. It was converted to flats in 1996 and is now known as St Gabriel&#x27;s Manor.

The core of the later-to-be YBAs, graduated from the Goldsmiths BA Fine Art degree course in the classes of 1987–90. Liam Gillick, Fiona Rae, Steve Park and Sarah Lucas, were graduates in the class of 1987. Ian Davenport, Michael Landy, Gary Hume, Anya Gallaccio, Henry Bond and Angela Bulloch, were graduates in the class of 1988; Damien Hirst, Angus Fairhurst, Mat Collishaw, Simon Patterson, and Abigail Lane, were graduates from the class of 1989; whilst Gillian Wearing, and Sam Taylor-Wood, were graduates from the class of 1990. During the years 1987–90, the teaching staff on the Goldsmiths BA Fine Art included Jon Thompson, Richard Wentworth, Michael Craig-Martin, Ian Jeffrey, Helen Chadwick, Mark Wallinger, Judith Cowan and Glen Baxter. Collishaw has a studio in a pub in Camberwell. as does the sculptor Anish Kapoor.

In his memoir Lucky Kunst, artist Gregor Muir, writes: 
::Not yet housed in the university building at New Cross to which it eventually moved in the late 1980s, Goldsmiths was a stone&#x27;s throw away in Myatts Field on the other side of Camberwell Green. In contrast to Camberwell&#x27;s Friday night bacchanal, Goldsmith&#x27;s held its disco on a Tuesday evening with dinner ladies serving drinks, including tea, from a service hatch. This indicated to me that Goldsmiths was deeply uncool.

The building was also the hospital where Vera Brittain served as a nurse and described in her memoir &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;.

===Literature===

Thomas Hood, humorist and author of &quot;The Song of the Shirt&quot;, lived in Camberwell from 1840 for two years; initially at 8, South Place, (now 181, Camberwell New Road). He later moved to 2, Union Row (now 266, High Street). He wrote to friends praising the clean air. In late 1841, he moved to St John&#x27;s Wood. The Victorian art critic and watercolourist John Ruskin lived at 163 Denmark Hill from 1847, but moved out in 1872 as the railways spoiled his view. Ruskin designed part of a stained-glass window in St Giles&#x27; Church, Camberwell. Ruskin Park is named after him, and there is also a John Ruskin Street.

Another famous writer who lived in the area was the poet Robert Browning, who was born in nearby Walworth, and lived there until he was 28. Novelist George Gissing, in the summer of 1893, took lodgings at 76 Burton Road, Brixton. From Burton Road he went for long walks through nearby Camberwell, soaking up impressions of the way of life he saw emerging there.&quot; This led him to writing &quot;In the Year of Jubilee&quot;, the story of &quot;the romantic and sexual initiation of a suburban heroine, Nancy Lord.&quot; Gissing originally called his novel &quot;Miss Lord of Camberwell&quot;.

Muriel Spark, the author of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of Peckham Rye&quot; lived, between 1955 and 1965, in a bedsit at 13 Baldwin Crescent, Camberwell. The novelist Mary Jane Staples, who grew up in Walworth, wrote a book called &quot;The King of Camberwell&quot;, the third instalment of her Adams family saga about Cockney life. Comedian Jenny Eclair is a long-term resident of Camberwell, and the area features in her 2001 novel &quot;Camberwell Beauty&quot;, named after a species of butterfly. Playwright Martin McDonagh and his brother, writer/director John Michael McDonagh, live in Camberwell. The 2014 novel &quot;The Paying Guests&quot; by Sarah Waters is set in 1920s Camberwell. In Daniel Defoe&#x27;s novel &quot;Roxana&quot; (1724) the eponymous protagonist imagines her daughter, Susan, &quot;drown&#x27;d in the Great Pond at Camberwell&quot;.

Nearby Peckham Rye was an important in the imaginative and creative development of poet William Blake, who, when he was eight, claimed to have seen the Prophet Ezekiel there under a bush, and he was probably ten years old when he had a vision of angels in a tree.

===Film===
Camberwell is referred to in the film &quot;Withnail and I&quot; – &quot;Camberwell carrot&quot; is the name of the enormous spliff rolled using 12 rolling papers, by Danny the dealer. His explanation for the name is, &quot;I invented it in Camberwell and it looks like a carrot&quot;.

===Music===
The avant-garde band Camberwell Now named themselves after the area.

Basement Jaxx recorded three songs about Camberwell: &quot;Camberwell Skies&quot;, &quot;Camberskank&quot; and &quot;I live in Camberwell&quot; which are on &quot;The Singles: Special Edition&quot; album (2005).

Florence Welch from British indie-rock band Florence and the Machine wrote and recorded a song entitled &quot;South London Forever&quot; on her 2018 album High as Hope based on her experience growing up in Camberwell, naming places such as the Joiners Arms and the Horniman Museum.

===Festivals===
Camberwell has played host to many festivals over the years, with the long-running Camberwell Arts Festival celebrating 20 years in 2014, and Camberwell Fair taking place on Camberwell Green in 2015, 2017 and 2018, resurrecting an ancient Fair that took place on the same green from 1279 to 1855.{ Since 2013, there is also an annual 10-day film festival – Camberwell Free Film Festival (CFFF) which is usually held in March/April in addition to special one-off screenings at other times of the year.

==Transport==
=== History ===
Until the First World War, Camberwell was served by three railway stations – Denmark Hill, Camberwell Gate (near Walworth), and Camberwell New Road in the west. Camberwell Gate and Camberwell New Road were closed in 1916 &#x27;temporarily&#x27; because of war shortages, but were never reopened.

London Underground has planned a Bakerloo line extension to Camberwell on at least three occasions since the 1930s.

=== Rail ===
Denmark Hill and Loughborough Junction railway stations serve Camberwell, whilst Peckham Rye and East Dulwich are both approximately from Camberwell Green. These stations are all in London fare zone 2. London Overground, Southeastern, and Thameslink trains serve Denmark Hill. There are regular rail services to various destinations across Central London. There are also direct rail links to destinations elsewhere in London and the South East from Denmark Hill.

London Overground connects the area directly to Clapham and Battersea in the west, and Canada Water and Dalston east London. Thameslink trains carry passengers to Kentish Town in the north, whilst some peak-time services continue to destinations in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire, such as Luton Airport. Eastbound Thameslink services travel towards Orpington or Sevenoaks, via Peckham, Catford, and Bromley, amongst other destinations. Southeastern trains eastbound serve destinations in South East London and Kent, including Peckham, Lewisham, Gravesend, and Dover.

Loughborough Junction is on the Thameslink route between St Albans City and Sutton. This provides Camberwell with a direct link southbound to Herne Hill, Streatham, Tooting, Wimbledon, Mitcham, and Sutton, amongst other destinations in South London. Northbound services run through the City of London and St Pancras. Destinations north of St Pancras include Kentish Town and West Hampstead. A limited Southeastern service between Blackfriars and Kent runs through Loughborough Junction.

=== Bus ===
Camberwell is served by numerous London Bus routes. Routes through Camberwell typically run east-west between Vauxhall and Peckham, or north-south between Elephant &amp; Castle and Brixton or Dulwich.

==Notable residents==
Residents of the area have included children&#x27;s author Enid Mary Blyton, who was born at 354 Lordship Lane, East Dulwich, on 11 August 1897 (though shortly afterwards the family moved to Beckenham), and the former leader of the TGWU, Jack Jones, who lived on the Ruskin House Park estate. Karl Marx initially settled with his family in Camberwell when they moved to London in 1849. 

Others include the former editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; Peter Preston. &quot;The Guardian&quot; columnist Zoe Williams is another resident, whilst Florence Welch of the rock band Florence + the Machine also lives in the area, as do actresses Lorraine Chase and Jenny Agutter. Syd Barrett, one of the founders of Pink Floyd, studied at Camberwell College of Arts from 1964.

<text>Canonbury is an area in London, forming part of the London Borough of Islington. It is located within the area between Essex Road, Upper Street and Cross Street and either side of St Paul&#x27;s Road in North London. 

In 1253 land in the area was granted to the Canons of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Priory, Smithfield, and became known as Canonbury. The area continued predominantly as open land until it was developed as a suburb in the early 19th century.

In common with similar inner London areas, it suffered decline when the construction of railways in the 1860s enabled commuting into the city from further afield. The gentrification of the area from the 1950s included new developments to replace war-damaged properties in Canonbury Park North and South as well as restoration of older buildings.

==Geography==
Canonbury is traditionally an area of Islington, and has never been an administrative unit in its own right. For this reason it has never had formally defined boundaries, but approximates to the area between Essex Road, Upper Street and Cross Street and either side of St Paul&#x27;s Road. The Canonbury electoral ward within the London Borough of Islington extends as far east as Southgate Road.

East Canonbury is the south-eastern corner of the district, bordering on the Regents Canal. Parts of this area were transferred to the district from the London Borough of Hackney in a boundary adjustment (along the line of the northern towpath of the canal), in 1993.

In the east is the Marquess Estate, a 1,200 dwelling council estate, completed in 1976 on , and designed by Darbourne &amp; Darke. A dark red brick, traffic free estate, it was praised as an example of municipal architecture, but acquired a bad reputation and has since been extensively redeveloped to improve security for residents.

==Places of interest==
*Canonbury Tower – The manor house of Canonbury was constructed by William Bolton of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Priory between 1509 and 1532. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries it was granted to Thomas Cromwell. In the 1590s the manor house was rebuilt by Sir John Spencer, Lord Mayor of the City of London, including the construction of its tower. The tower has been occupied by many historical figures, including the philosopher and Lord Chancellor Francis Bacon, and the Irish novelist and playwright Oliver Goldsmith. The Tower Theatre Company was based here from 1953 to 2003. It is currently used as a Masonic research centre.
*Canonbury Square – Developed between 1805 and 1830, it includes a variety of distinct styles. In 1812, when few properties had been built, the New North Road turnpike, now known as Canonbury Road, was constructed and bisects the square. Many significant figures from the arts and literary worlds have lived on the square, including the writers George Orwell and Evelyn Waugh, and the actor Samuel Phelps.
*The Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art is in Canonbury Square.
*John Spencer Square – A residential garden square named after Sir John Spencer, Lord Mayor of the City of London, former residents include Barbara Castle, Labour politician and former Secretary of State, and English constitutional historian David Starkey.
*New River Walk – The New River, an aqueduct built by Sir Hugh Myddelton to supply fresh water to London, was completed in 1613. The walk is in two parts, with a break at Willowbridge. The southern section received an early National Lottery grant, and has a back-pumping scheme which simulates the water flow of the original aqueduct.
*Arlington Square – voted one of the UK&#x27;s best garden squares.

==Literary and artistic connections==

George Orwell moved to 27b Canonbury Square in the autumn of 1944 – he and his wife having been bombed out of their previous flat, in Mortimer Crescent, on 28 June 1944. Evelyn Waugh lived at 17a Canonbury Square from 1928 to 1930. Charles Dickens wrote a Christmas story about a lamplighter in Canonbury, which features the Tower. Leslie Forbes, the travel and detective story writer, and pseudohistorian Gavin Menzies both lived in the area. M. V. Hughes (née Thomas) lived at 1 Canonbury Park North (the house is no longer standing) as a child, and describes life there in her memoir &quot;A London Child of the 1870s&quot;.

==Churches==

*St Paul&#x27;s, at the junction of Essex Road and Balls Pond Road, was designed in 1826-28 by Charles Barry for the Church of England. Its parish was merged with St Jude, Mildmay and since 1997 the building has been used as a Steiner school.
*St Stephen&#x27;s Church, Church of England, is on Canonbury Road and was built in 1839.

<doc id="93914" wikidata="Q2220276" url="?curid=93914" title="Carshalton">
<text>Carshalton ( ) is a town, with a historic village centre, in south London, England, within the London Borough of Sutton. It is situated south-southwest of Charing Cross, in the valley of the River Wandle, one of the sources of which is Carshalton Ponds in the middle of the village. Prior to the creation of Greater London in 1965, Carshalton was in the administrative county of Surrey.

Carshalton consists of a number of neighbourhoods. The main focal point, Carshalton Village, is visually scenic and picturesque. At its centre it has two adjoining ponds, which are overlooked by the Grade II listed All Saints Church on the south side and the Victorian Grove Park on the north side. The Grade II listed Honeywood Museum sits on the west side, a few yards from the water. There are a number of other listed buildings, as well as three conservation areas, including one in the village. In addition to Honeywood Museum, there are several other cultural features in Carshalton, including the Charles Cryer Theatre and an art gallery in Oaks Park. It is also home to the Sutton Ecology Centre, and every year an environmental fair is held in Carshalton Park to the south of the village.

Carshalton is part of the Carshalton and Wallington parliamentary constituency formed in 1983. Tom Brake (Liberal Democrat) was its MP from 1997 to 2019, and Elliot Colburn (Conservative) was the MP from 2019 to 2024. As of 2024, Bobby Dean (Liberal Democrat) is the current MP.

The combined population of the five wards comprising Carshalton was 45,525 at the 2001 census. A majority of the population of Carshalton is in the ABC1 social group. In the 2011 Census the wards had been merged into 3 with a total population of 29,917.

== History ==

To the south of the area now known as Carshalton, remains of artefacts dating from the Neolithic to the Iron Age have been found, suggesting that this was an early place of habitation. Prior to the Norman Conquest it is recorded that there were five manors in this location owned by five freemen.

The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative division of Wallington hundred.

Carshalton appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Aultone&quot;. It was held by Goisfrid (Geoffrey) de Mandeville. Its domesday assets were: 3½ hides; 1 church, 10 ploughs, 1 mill worth £1 15s 0d, of meadow, woodland worth 2 hogs. It rendered £15 10s 0d.

In the Domesday era there was a church and a water mill in Carshalton, which was then still made up of a number of hamlets dotted around the area, as opposed to a single compact village.

In the Middle Ages the land in the village was generally farmed in the form of a number of open fields, divided into strips. The number of strips which each land owner possessed was based roughly on his wealth. There was also an area of open downland in the south of the parish for grazing sheep.

Carshalton was known for its springs; these may have given the place its name &quot;Cars – Aul – ton&quot;. &quot;Aul&quot; means well or spring. A &quot;ton&quot; is a farm which was in some way enclosed. The meaning of the Cars element is uncertain but early spellings (Kersaulton and Cresaulton) may indicate connection with a cross or perhaps cress, watercress having been grown locally.

In his book &quot;History of the Worthies of England&quot;, the 17th century historian Thomas Fuller refers to Carshalton for its walnuts and trout.

Land was primarily put to arable use and the river Wandle gave rise to manufacturing using water power. A water mill to grind corn was mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;. By the end of the 18th century it was recorded that there were several mills for the production of paper and parchment, leather, snuff, log-wood and seed oil. There were also bleaching grounds for calico.

There were timber-framed houses from the end of the Middle Ages, and brick and wooden weather boarded houses from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. By the middle of the 19th century Carshalton&#x27;s population was 2,411, making it, at the time, the largest village in what was to become the London Borough of Sutton. It had a very varied character with houses for the wealthy at one extreme and tenements in back yards at the other. In 1847 a railway line was laid from Croydon to Epsom through Carshalton, but the first station was built in fields south of Wallington. A station in the village itself was not established until 1868 when the Sutton to Mitcham Line was constructed. The development of Carshalton got into its stride in the early 1890s when the Carshalton Park Estate was sold for housing development.

Carshalton is mentioned in the following historic Surrey folk-rhyme:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Sutton for mutton,
Carshalton for beeves,
Epsom for whores,
and Ewell for thieves.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;
During the Victorian era and into the early 20th century, Carshalton was known for its lavender fields (also see below under &quot;Landmarks&quot;), but the increasing land demand for residential building put an end to commercial growing.

The Commonwealth War Graves Commission lists 78 civilian casualties in Carshalton during World War II.
Carshalton formed part of the Carshalton Urban District from 1894 to 1965; the UDC was based at the Carshalton Council Offices in The Square until the 1920s when it moved to The Grove.

== Geography ==

Central Carshalton, around the ponds and High Street, retains a village character, although the busy A232 runs through the area. There are a number of buildings and open spaces protected by the Carshalton Village Conservation Area. given the status by the London Borough of Sutton. In 1993 its boundary was extended to include parts of Mill Lane and parts of The Square and Talbot Road, containing the All Saints Church Rectory. The Conservation Area contains many of the Listed and Locally Listed Buildings which contribute to the historical significance of the area, and is widely considered to contain some of the finest historical architecture and road layout within the Borough. An example is Stone Court, an early 19th-century building with a gate house, situated on the northern edge of Grove Park. The Sun public house, is a fine example of Victorian decorative brickwork, and makes a positive contribution to the Conservation Area.

The Conservation Area also comprises open parkland of historical importance, including the grounds of Carshalton House Estate (which contains St. Philomena&#x27;s Catholic School, St Mary&#x27;s Junior School, St Mary&#x27;s Infants School and the Water Tower) and The Grove Park (which contains The Grove).
Other conservation areas in Carshalton are the Wrythe Green Conservation Area and the Park Hill Conservation Area.

Sutton is centred west of the town centre of Carshalton, its east–west central street can be considered a continuation of Carshalton&#x27;s own main street, an almost straight A-road route to Orpington via Croydon, beginning in Ewell.

Carshalton-on-the-Hill is the residential area on the high chalk upland ground to the south of Carshalton Park from Boundary Road in the east, Crichton Road/Queen Mary&#x27;s Avenue/Diamond Jubilee Way in the west and the smallholdings of Little Woodcote to the south. In the heart of Carshalton-on-the-Hill is Stanley Park (which is often used as a term to describe the area).

Carshalton Beeches is the area to the west of Carshalton-on-the-Hill, from Crichton Road/Queen Mary&#x27;s Avenue/Diamond Jubilee Way in the east, Banstead Road/Banstead Road South in the west and Fairlawn Road to the south. It grew up around the railway station which was named after Beeches Avenue, a street near to its location; which, in turn, is named after the beech trees which line it.

The Wrythe lies between Carshalton village to the south and St Helier to the north-west. Its name is thought to derive from the rye that was once grown in this area, or from the Anglo-Saxon word &quot;rithe&quot; which means a small stream. During the time of the Roman occupation of the British Isles, a small spring was situated near the green, now adjacent to a BP garage. Roman activity in the area is confirmed by the fact that there was once a Roman Villa built in Beddington, just a couple of miles away, and a number of roads in the vicinity of Roman origin. The spring has since disappeared under ground and the culvert it feeds flows into the Wandle near Hackbridge.
== Landmarks ==

=== All Saints Church ===
The Grade II* listed Anglican parish church of All Saints is located at the west end of Carshalton High Street, opposite Carshalton Ponds. A church has stood on this site since at least Norman times and probably much longer. The current church contains 12th century work; the tower is the oldest part of the building and is thought to date back to before the Norman Conquest. The church has been much extended over the centuries: the north side, which most visitors see first, is a Victorian facade constructed mostly of dark flint; but the south side is earlier, and shows signs of the many alterations that have been made. The most significant change to the building was in 1891 when a new nave and north aisle were added. The dramatic west end gallery, which accommodates the large three manual Willis Organ, was designed by the Anglo-catholic architect Ninian Comper.

Just outside the churchyard wall is a spring locally known as &quot;Anne Boleyn&#x27;s Well&quot;. It is popularly said to have received this name because it appeared when Anne Boleyn&#x27;s horse kicked a stone and a spring of water appeared. But the more likely explanation is that the name is a corruption of &quot;Boulogne&quot;. The Counts of Boulogne owned land here in the 12th century and there may have been a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Boulogne near the well.

=== Strawberry Lodge ===
Constructed in 1685, Strawberry Lodge is one of Carshalton&#x27;s oldest buildings. It was built by Josias Dewye who was described in records at the time as a &#x27;clothworker and citizen of London&#x27;. In the late 17th century Josias moved from Chilworth to Carshalton to run a Gunpowder Mill on the River Wandle and decided to make his home nearby at the lodge.

Located on the corner of Strawberry Lane and Mill Lane, Strawberry Lodge is owned by Carshalton Baptist Church. Besides being a place of worship it is also used during the week as a conference and training centre. During the 1990s the site was renovated by the Baptist Church supported by the London Borough of Sutton.

=== Lavender Fields ===
There are two historic lavender fields. One, at Oaks Way, Carshalton Beeches is a not-for-profit community project that manages three acres of lavender. The other, a 25-acre commercial site in Croydon Lane called Mayfield, is popular with tourists. It is located just within the Carshalton South and Clockhouse ward within the London Borough of Sutton. This area was once famous as the &quot;Lavender Capital of the World&quot;. From the 18th to the early 20th centuries the North Downs of Surrey, with its chalky free-draining soil, ideal for lavender growing, were at the centre of worldwide production of lavender. It was a very prosperous part of the local agriculture. Blue fields could be seen all over Mitcham, Croydon, Wallington, Banstead, Carshalton and Sutton. The scale of the operation can be understood from the fact that the &quot;Daily News&quot; in 1914 was able to state:

=== Carshalton House Water Tower ===

The Grade II* listed Water Tower (or Bagnio as it was known at the time) was built in the early 18th century, primarily to house a water driven pump supplying water to Carshalton House (now St Philomena&#x27;s School) and the fountains in its gardens. It was planned as a multi-purpose building, and also contains an orangery, a saloon and a bathroom which retains original Delft tiles. The Water Tower is also surrounded by a garden, which features an 18th-century Hermitage, which was restored in the early 1990s, as well as the rustic-style &quot;Folly Bridge&quot;.

=== Little Holland House ===
Little Holland House in Carshalton Beeches was the home of the artist and designer Frank Dickinson (1874–1961). Dickinson&#x27;s Arts and Crafts style interior was influenced by the writings of John Ruskin and William Morris. The house contains many of his art works. Dickinson built his house between 1902 and 1904, and achieved a unique blend of traditional and Art Nouveau, which has featured in several recent TV series on architectural history. Inside the Grade II listed interior are his hand-made furniture, paintings, interior decoration, carvings and metalwork. Dickinson named his house as a homage to George Frederick Watts, the Victorian artist, sculptor and social campaigner, whose ideals he greatly admired.

The House is now open to members of the public on the first Sunday of every month, plus the Sunday and Monday of Bank Holiday weekends, between 11am and 5pm. Admission is free.
=== The Orangery ===
The Orangery in The Square was built in the second half of the 18th century in Carshalton Park (the section of which between here and Ruskin Road has since been built over). It is thought to have been built by one George Taylor, who owned plantations in the West Indies. By the late 19th century the Orangery was being used a stable. It is now used as office space, for the Environment Agency. It was renovated in 1987 by film actor Oliver Reed (and his son Mark) at his own expense.

=== The Oaks bakehouse ===
The late 19th century bakehouse in Oaks Park is all that remains of &quot;The Oaks&quot; mansion which burned down and was demolished in the 1950s. The original bread oven remains in situ. Blocks of burnt bricks from the ruins of the great house were used by local builders to construct garden walls for houses all along Woodmansterne Road, and may still be seen today.

=== Honeywood Museum ===

Honeywood is a large Grade II listed house at the western end of the picturesque Carshalton Ponds. At its earliest, it dates from the 17th century but it has been much extended and restored since. In particular, during the period 1896 to 1903 when it was owned by one John Pattinson Kirk, a London merchant, a large Edwardian wing was added to the south side. The 17th century element lies behind the façade in the form of a flint and chalk chequer building. The house now plays host to the London Borough of Sutton&#x27;s Museum, and has a local history collection, including objects that date back to the Bronze Age. There is a tea room and a shop.

The museum was refurbished, reopening in May 2012 with enhanced features. There are now expanded displays, including an interactive map, about the River Wandle and its influence on the life of the area, and a collection of Edwardian toys on display in the &quot;Childhood Room&quot;. The interior was restored to its 1903 colour scheme, and the refurbishment also included a restoration of the Edwardian billiards room, its table and fittings, the drawing Room and the bathroom.

=== Sutton Ecology Centre ===
The Sutton Ecology Centre is located in the Carshalton Village part of Sutton borough. The Grounds are a 1.3 hectare Local Nature Reserve and Site of Borough Importance for Nature Conservation, Grade 1. It is owned by Sutton Council and managed by the Council together with Sutton Nature Conservation Volunteers – SNCV.

It is an area of mainly open space where visitors can find out about wildlife habitats, alternative energy, recycling, composting, and organic gardening. The centre&#x27;s activities include running educational visits for schools and community groups, as well as events and volunteer days.

The history of the Ecology Centre is that the grounds were until the late eighties known as the &quot;Lodgelands&quot;, named after the old gardens of The Lodge in Carshalton. They were used as a tree nursery until the early eighties, when they became surplus to requirements. After a prolonged public debate, it was agreed in 1987 to preserve the area as an open space for public use.

== Parks ==


In common with the London Borough of Sutton as a whole, Carshalton has many green spaces, with three of its main public parks worthy of particular note.

=== Carshalton Park ===
The present day Carshalton Park is situated south of the High Street, in the area bounded by Ruskin Road, Ashcombe Road and Woodstock Road. The park and some of the surrounding houses lie within a conservation area. Although much reduced from its original size, it still offers features of historical significance and includes a grotto, the &quot;Hog Pit&quot; Pond, and a recently rediscovered air raid shelter. Hog Pit is now empty of water, and takes the form of an amphitheatre which is utilised as the main stage for the annual Environmental Fair, which the park plays host to.

=== Grove Park ===

Grove Park, closest to the village centre, is the best example of a Victorian park in the Borough. It is situated in the area approximately bounded by the High Street, North Street and Mill Lane. The park land was in mediaeval times part of the manor of Stone Court, then consisting mainly of meadows. The manor house was situated at the corner of North Street and Mill Lane. The Grove, including the ornamental gardens, was bought by Carshalton Urban District Council in 1924 and the park was opened to the public a few years later.

The southwest corner of Grove Park lies next to one of Carshalton&#x27;s ponds (Lower Pond), from whence the River Wandle flows through the park. Among its features of interest is the &quot;Leoni Bridge&quot;, situated where Grove Park meets the Lower Pond. It is made of white Portland stone. Its name derives from the conjecture that the Venetian architect Giacomo Leoni designed it. Leoni had been commissioned to design a new mansion for Carshalton Park during the early 18th century (although the mansion itself was never constructed). Grove Park also features Grove House, a large early nineteenth house, a watermill and a cascade. The cascade is near the footbridge leading to the Stone Court corner of the park. The 1.5-metre fall is now ornamental in design, but its original purpose was to create a head of water in order to provide power for the nearby &quot;Upper Mill&quot;.

=== Oaks Park ===

Oaks Park is a large park landscaped in a generally naturalistic style, providing downland walks. It is varied and includes formal horticulture, natural chalk meadows, woodlands and informal parkland. It was substantially laid out for the Earl of Derby nearly 250 years ago – in the 1770s – but its villa dates back further than that. The villa (for one Thomas Gosling) was built around 1750, in the era&#x27;s fashionable landscape style, with trees forming a perimeter screen and placed in artful clumps to suggest a natural landscape. The house was partly rebuilt by Robert Taylor (architect) for John Burgoyne in 1775 and by Robert Adam for the 12th Earl of Derby in 1790. The villa&#x27;s bakehouse, stable block and some outbuildings remain to this day.

The Oaks Park estate lent its name to the Oaks horse-race which was inaugurated by the Earl in 1779, and is run annually during the Derby meeting at Epsom Downs Racecourse, about 4 miles to the west. The original Oaks Race ran from Barrow Hedges, north of The Oaks and through Oaks Park before heading west to approximately the site of the current Epsom Downs Racecourse. Part of the off-road route still exists.

The modern day open space also hosts a public golf course and sports centre. The park itself contains a craft-centre and a café. There are also the Oaks Park Studios set in the 1770 stable block, where working artists display their paintings and other artwork.
== Events ==
=== Charles Cryer Theatre ===

The Charles Cryer Theatre is situated on Carshalton High Street, within walking distance of Carshalton and Carshalton Beeches railway stations (Carshalton station is the nearer of the two). The theatre opened in the early 1990s on the site of a former public hall as part of the then &quot;Arts in Carshalton&quot; campaign coordinated by the local council. The theatre is named after the man who led the campaign to open the Secombe Theatre in neighbouring Sutton. As well as drama and musicals, productions include comedy and dance: past material has included Shakespeare and Chekov on the one hand and pantomime on the other, in order to balance popularity with quality. The theatre also serves as a concert venue for local bands and has played host to the local Rockshot festival. The theatre building also incorporates a Thai restaurant.

The theatre closed in 2016 and was subsequently put out to lease. At a meeting in October 2018, the local council announced that the theatre would be brought back into use, following a successful bid to run the venue (on a 25-year lease) by Cryer Arts Ltd. The company plans a range of events, including music, film and theatre.

=== Carshalton Environmental Fair ===
The Environmental Fair is held in Carshalton Park on August Bank Holiday Monday.
It features over 100 stalls and showcases local sustainability initiatives. It also includes music, performing art, poetry, children&#x27;s activities, campaign groups, local craft, interactive demonstrations, and a farmers&#x27; market. Music is performed from three stages and includes rock and folk. The main stage is a natural open-air amphitheatre. There is food and a bar with real ales. The fair attracts on average around 10,000 people. It is organised by EcoLocal with a team of volunteers.

=== Other events ===

Other annual events include the Carshalton Fireworks a charity fireworks display at Carshalton Park on the Saturday nearest to Guy Fawkes Night, a summer carnival on the second Saturday of June, a beer festival over the first Bank Holiday weekend in May,
and Carshalton Charter fair held in September.

The Ecology Centre and Honeywood Museum also hold regular events and meetings.

The Methodist hall in Ruskin Road is home to the Ruskin Players and the Carshalton Choral Society, both of which perform at regular intervals throughout the year.

The annual Carshalton Lavender harvest weekend is held in July, at Stanley Park Allotments, Carshalton-on-the-Hill.

== Economy ==

A number of businesses and organisations are based in Carshalton, such as the Institute of Refrigeration.

Retailing also forms a significant part of the local economy. There are number of separate shopping areas, with the small network of streets in Carshalton Village the main one.

The Village contains a variety of mainly independent establishments, including an art gallery, gift stores, clock dealers, antique shops, niche shops, coffee houses, pubs and restaurants. In 2014 a public house in West Street in Carshalton Village reached the Top Four of all pubs in the UK, according to CAMRA.

In Carshalton Beeches, half-a-mile to the south-east of the Village, there is a further shopping area, situated along a 300-yard stretch of the otherwise residential Beeches Avenue. Retail outlets in Beeches Avenue include an art gallery, a chocolatier, gift shops and hair and beauty salons.
== Transport ==
Carshalton has two railway stations: Carshalton and Carshalton Beeches. From 1847 to the opening of the current Carshalton in 1868 Wallington railway station was named Carshalton. Trains run from the current Carshalton to Victoria (in around 25 minutes), London Bridge and Thameslink stations including Blackfriars, Farringdon and Kings Cross St Pancras.

The closest London Underground station is Morden.

Bus services 127, 157, 407, 627 and SL7 also serve the High Street.

<text>Catford is a district in south east London, England, and the administrative centre of the London Borough of Lewisham. It is southwest of Lewisham itself, mostly in the Rushey Green and Catford South wards. The population of Catford, including Bellingham, was 44,905 in 2011.

Catford covers most of SE6 postcode district. The area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.

==History==

===Toponymy===

The origin of the name is unknown. Speculation suggests it may derive from the place where cattle crossed the river Ravensbourne in Anglo-Saxon times or from wild cats using the river crossing.

==Governance==
Catford is covered by the Rushey Green and Catford South wards in the London Borough of Lewisham. It also makes up a large part of the Lewisham East constituency.

==Built environment==
===Early developments===

Broadway Theatre is an art deco building adjoining the town hall. It is a curved stone structure decorated with shields and heraldic emblems and topped with a copper-green spire. It was opened in 1932 as the Concert Hall and is now a Grade II listed building. The interior is in art deco style. The last cinema in the borough (before the 2019 launch of Catford Mews) stood diagonally opposite the theatre until its closure in 2002. Catford also boasts a large Gothic police station. In 2006, a large blue pipe sculpture was unveiled outside Eros House, which was another former cinema (The Eros Cinema), and the Lewisham Hippodrome theatre.

The 1960s and 70s had a considerable impact on the architecture of Catford. The old Town Hall of 1875, was replaced by the current Civic Suite in 1968, soon after the merger of the metropolitan boroughs of Lewisham and Deptford. Laurence House, where many of the Lewisham Council functions are housed including the offices of the Mayor of Lewisham and the Young Mayors of Lewisham, is on the site of old St Laurence&#x27;s Church. The original Gothic C of E St. Laurence Church was located where Laurence House is today (known as the Catford Cathedral), but as part of the urban renewal of Catford in the 1960s, the church is now housed in a more modern style building 200 metres down Bromley Road. 

In Rushey Green the old village water hand-pump from the 1850s survives.

At the end of World War II, the 186-bungalow Excalibur Estate was laid out in Catford, and by 2011 was the largest surviving prefab estate in Britain. However, in spite of the opposition of many residents, all are due for demolition, apart from six with Grade II listing. A new estate on the site is due for completion by the mid 2020&#x27;s.

===Brutalist architecture===
A few examples of Brutalist architecture survive including the Catford shopping centre and Milford Towers, designed by the architect Owen Luder in 1974. The design was to make it &quot;the Barbican of the south&quot;.

Architecture critic Ian Nairn praised Eros House (Owen Luder, 1962) as:

A monster sat down in Catford and just what the place needed. No offence meant: this southward extension of Lewisham High Street badly wanted stiffening. Now there is a punchy concrete focus (&#x27;you know, that funny new building&#x27;) both close to and at a distance, from the desolate heights of the Downham Estate, where it stands straight to the afternoon sun. Rough concrete is put through all its paces, front convex eaves on Sainsbury&#x27;s to a staircase tower which is either afflicted with an astounding set of visual distortions or is actually leaning. Again, no offence meant. Unlike many other avant-garde buildings, particularly in the universities, this one is done from real conviction, not from a desire for self-advertisement. The gaunt honesty of those projecting concrete frames carrying boxed-out bow windows persists. It is not done at you and it transforms the surroundings instead of despising them. This most craggy and uncompromising of London buildings turns out to be full of firm gentleness.

In 2015 Lewisham Council decided to demolish Milford Towers, as the housing estate was in disrepair and the land could be better used to meet the needs of local residents. In 2018 the estate was however refurbished, with demolition still planned in the longer-term. 

===Landmarks===

One Catford landmark is the Catford Cat, a giant fibreglass sculpture of a black cat above the entrance to the Catford centre. There is also a street market on Catford Broadway.

Between 1932 and 2003, Catford Stadium was a successful greyhound racing track, but was closed and then destroyed by fire in 2005 and ultimately demolished to make way for new housing.

Catford&#x27;s oldest pub is the Black Horse and Harrow (now named The Ninth Life). The Catford Bridge Tavern is another heritage listed building close to the old dog track; this mock tudor pub burnt down in March 2015, but has since been refurbished and reopened in April 2017. Nearby, is St Dunstan&#x27;s College.

The area was once home to the Catford Studios, producing films during the silent era. Catford also used to have a cinema diametric to the theatre. Catford was also satirised in &quot;The Chap&quot; magazine in a series called &#x27;A Year in Catford&#x27; named after Peter Mayle&#x27;s best-seller &quot;A Year in Provence&quot;. The magazine poked fun at Catford&#x27;s mundanity.

==Regeneration==
Catford town centre is a priority area for regeneration in the London Borough of Lewisham. Several key sites around the town centre have been identified for redevelopment – Milford Towers, Catford Island, The Civic Centre, Lewisham Town Hall and The &quot;Wickes&quot; site have all been highlighted for significant change in the proposed Catford Plan.

The council&#x27;s aspiration is for the complete redevelopment of the Catford Shopping Centre and Milford Towers, which would require demolition of both plus the car parks and associated buildings along Thomas Lane. However, attempts to regenerate Catford have been hampered by various complex issues such as finance and the number of different landowners in and around the town centre.

==Transport==

===Rail===
Catford is served by two railway stations, Catford and Catford Bridge. Catford provides the area with Thameslink services to Kentish Town, London Blackfriars, Orpington via Bromley South and to Sevenoaks via Bromley South and Swanley. Catford Bridge is served by Southeastern services to London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street via Lewisham and to Hayes.

===Buses===
Catford is served by many Transport for London bus routes.

===Road===
Catford&#x27;s main road is the A205 South Circular which crosses South London, running from Woolwich in the east to the junction of the A406 (North Circular Road), the M4 and the A4 at Gunnersbury in the west.

===Proposed transport links===

====Bakerloo line extension====
There are proposals for a Bakerloo line extension to Lewisham, with a possible longer-term second phase to Catford and Hayes. As of 2022, no final decisions had been made.

====Docklands Light Railway extension====
Transport for London (TfL) are currently considering the extension of the Docklands Light Railway from Lewisham to Bromley, with the first phase being from Lewisham to Catford. So far TfL have not expressed a preferred route, provided detailed plans, or indicated costs and funding. Lewisham Council has suggested that any route should be underground to reduce physical and visual impact.

==Education==

===Local authority maintained schools===
The local council maintains Conisborough College and Greenvale School.

===Independent schools===
Catford has two independent schools, St Dunstan&#x27;s College and a small faith school, Springfield Christian School.

===Parks and green spaces===

====River Pool Linear Park====
The walk follows the River Pool downstream from the Ravensbourne River. The banking has been planted with native trees and shrubs, herbaceous planting, wild flower grassland and wetland marginal planting. The park forms part of the Waterlink Way which forms a significant section of the river from Sydenham to the Thames.

Unlike many of London&#x27;s rivers, the Pool remains above ground for most of its length. The section of river flows through a linear park from Southend Lane to Catford Hill.

====Mountsfield Park====
In the 1920s, Charlton Athletic F.C. played at The Mount (stadium) in the park. The Council holds its annual People&#x27;s Day event here in July.

====Ladywell Fields====
The park consists of three fields with a river running through them, and is next to University Hospital Lewisham. The middle field contains one of the last established rare Dutch Elm trees in London.

====Iona Close Orchard====
Iona Close Orchard is a preserved Victorian garden. In common with most old orchards, the site is of high nature conservation value. The houses to which it originally belonged dated to about 1825.

===Sport===
====Facilities====
The 20-acre Jubilee Ground is operated by St Dunstan&#x27;s College.

Catford Stadium was one of the greyhound racing venues in the UK until its closure and subsequent demolition in 2005. It also hosted boxing and several other sporting events.

====Local sports teams====
Catford has a Non-League football club Lewisham Borough F.C. who play at the Ladywell Arena.

Kent County Cricket Club have played at Catford several times in the past.

The Catford Cycling Club was founded in 1886. In 1894 they built their own track south of Brownhill Road with a pagoda grandstand. By the 1950s the majority of the track had been built over but the club still exists.

<text>Chalk Farm is a small urban district of north west London, lying immediately north of Camden Town, in the London Borough of Camden.

==History==
===Manor of Rugmere===
Chalk Farm was originally known as the Manor of Rugmere, an estate that was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. The manor was one of five which made up the large Ancient Parish of St Pancras. Rugmere is thought to mean &quot;the Woodcock&#x27;s Pool&quot;.

Henry VIII bought part of the manor, detaching it to form the north-eastern part of what would become Regent&#x27;s Park, the remainder subsequently become more commonly known as Chalk Farm. Both the detached area and the remainder remained part of the parish of St Pancras.

In 1786 the estate was sold to Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton, it was described as &quot;commonly known as Chalk Farm&quot;. The term &quot;Rugmere (or Rug Moor)&quot; appeared to have endured for some time as a field name.

===Etymology===

The origin of the name is disputed: it certainly does not derive from the soil, as the area is built on London Clay. The consensus view is that &quot;Chalk Farm&quot; derives from Middle English &quot;Chaldecote&quot; or &quot;Caldecote&quot;, a common English toponym meaning &quot;cold cottage&quot; first attested in the area of Chalk Farm in 1256. This had become &quot;Chalcotts&quot; by the 16th century, and &quot;Chalk&quot; by 1746. The full form &quot;Chalk Farm&quot; is a 19th-century coinage, though &quot;Chalcott&quot; remained in use in the early 19th century for a nearby estate, formerly the Upper and Lower Chalcot Farms.

The Chalcott estate was farmed from England&#x27;s Lane in Belsize Park, in the parish of Hampstead, half a mile to the north-west (first recorded as &quot;Chaldecotes&quot; in the 13th century). The estate had split into Upper and Lower Chalcot Farms by 1720, but reunited and farmed from Upper Chalcot Farmhouse around 1797. The counter argument is that Lower Chalcot Farm was not Chalk Farm as often claimed, but actually farmed from another farmhouse on England&#x27;s Lane. If that argument is correct then Chalk Farm was never known as Chalcot, but probably named for the whitewashed farm buildings. Chalk has often been used as a product in whitewash. The farmhouse at Lower Chalcot was sometimes referred to as the &quot;White House&quot;.

==Geography==
The area is not formally defined, though the former Manor of Chalk Farm was a component part of the Ancient Parish and Borough of St Pancras. The core area lies between Chalk Farm Road in the east and St Pancras&#x27; western boundary to the west; an area that extends to Ainger Road and takes in part of the Primrose Hill open space, though the hill itself is in Hampstead.

Chalk Farm includes part of the Camden Town with Primrose Hill ward, and perhaps also part of the Haverstock ward. As of 2020, Camden&#x27;s wards are being reviewed and these wards will be abolished or have their boundaries redrawn.

===Neighbouring places===
*Primrose Hill 
*Camden Town 
*Regent&#x27;s Park
*Kentish Town
*Maitland Park
*St John&#x27;s Wood 
*Swiss Cottage

==Social conditions==
The south of the area has regular residents on its broadest definition, which is capable of including Jude Law, Sadie Frost and Sienna Miller among the highest-grossing early 21st century &#x27;Camden set&#x27; of writers, artists and actors, but equally, parts of both wards have some stubborn poverty and a significant minority of their housing is social housing.

Census data for local wards gives an indication of varied social conditions in the area. 
==Transport==
Chalk Farm on the north–south Northern line, Edgware branch. The nearest London Overground station (east–west) is centred east: Kentish Town West.

<text>Clifford Harper (born 13 July 1949 in Chiswick, West London) is a worker, illustrator, and militant anarchist. He wrote &quot;Anarchy: A Graphic Guide&quot; in 1987. He is a long-term contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper and many other publications.

== Personal life ==
Clifford Harper is a worker, illustrator and militant anarchist. He was born in Chiswick, West London – at that time within Middlesex – on 13 July 1949. His father was a postman and his mother a cook. Expelled from school at 13 and placed on two years probation at 14, he then worked in a series of &quot;menial jobs&quot; before &quot;turning on, tuning in, and dropping out&quot; in 1967.

After living in a commune in Cumberland, he started a commune on Eel Pie Island in the River Thames near Richmond, Surrey, in 1969. In 1971, he took part in the All London Squatters organization, squatting in Camden, North London, then Stepney Green, East London, and Camberwell in South East London, while being very active in anarchist circles. In 1974, he settled in Camberwell, where he has lived ever since. Harper has long-term health issues and suffered a heart attack in 2006.

==Illustrator==

From the early 1970s onwards, Harper became a prolific illustrator for many anarchist, radical, alternative and mainstream publications, organisations, groups and individuals. He self-published his own &quot;Class War Comix&quot; and illustrated for among others &quot;Undercurrents&quot; magazine and books on Stuart Christie&#x27;s Cienfuegos Press.

Heavily influenced by George Grosz, Félix Vallotton, Fernand Léger, Eric Gill and in particular the narrative woodcuts of Frans Masereel, Harper&#x27;s style evolved in the 1980s in a bolder, expressionist direction, with much of his later work resembling woodcut, although he mainly works in pen and ink, and watercolour.

Harper has published work in all major UK newspapers. He is a regular and longterm contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper. Since 1996, he has supplied illustrations for the &quot;Country Diary&quot; column and between 1999 and 2002, he illustrated the &quot;Last Word&quot; column written by philosopher AC Grayling.

&quot;Anarchy: A Graphic Guide&quot;, which Harper wrote and illustrated, was published by Camden Press in 1987. It begins: &quot;Like all really good ideas, Anarchy is pretty simple when you get down to it - Human beings are at their very best when they are living free of authority, deciding things among themselves rather than being ordered about. That&#x27;s what &#x27;Anarchy&#x27; means - &#x27;Without Government&#x27;.

Harper had a strong association with Freedom Press from 1969 up to 2005 as well as many other anarchist groups, publications and individuals. Harper remains an engaged anarchist activist, having been involved with organising the UK&#x27;s annual Anarchist Bookfair, re-designing Freedom newspaper in 2005, producing books, pamphlets, posters, book covers, postcards and drawings for, and supporting, anarchists everywhere. His drawings have been used and reproduced by anarchists and others in nearly every country of the world.

&quot;Stamps: Designs for anarchist postage stamps&quot; was published by Rebel Press in 1997, with an essay by Colin Ward. It contained 16 portraits of figures such as Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, Louise Michel and Herbert Read. Harper also wrote an afterword.

&quot;Graphic Anarchy&quot;, an exhibition of his work, was held in 2003 at the Newsroom Gallery, London.

In March 2020, a plaque made by Harper was unveiled in Plymouth, making tribute to the Tolpuddle Martyrs. In 1837, some of the martyrs returned to Dorset from Australia after being pardoned.

<doc id="93923" wikidata="Q2240615" url="?curid=93923" title="Cheam">
<text>Cheam () is a suburb of London, England, southwest of Charing Cross. It is divided into North Cheam, Cheam Village and South Cheam. Cheam Village contains the listed buildings Lumley Chapel and the 16th-century Whitehall. It is adjacent to two large parks, Nonsuch Park and Cheam Park. Nonsuch Park contains the listed Nonsuch Mansion. Parts of Cheam Park and Cheam Village are in a conservation area. Cheam is bordered by Worcester Park to the northwest, Morden to the northeast, Sutton to the east, Epsom, Ewell and Stoneleigh to the west and Banstead and Belmont to the south.

==History==
The Roman road of Stane Street forms part of the boundary of Cheam. The modern London Road at North Cheam follows the course of the Roman road through the area. It is designated A24.

The village lay within the Anglo-Saxon administrative division of Wallington hundred. Cheam is mentioned in the Charters of Chertsey Abbey in 727, which mentions Cheam being given to the monastery of Chertsey in 675; the name appears as &quot;Cegeham&quot;. However, the Charters are of dubious origin and are now regarded as obvious fabrications. The name &#x27;Cheam&#x27;, based on &quot;Cegeham&quot;, may mean &#x27;village or homestead by the tree-stumps&#x27;.
Cheam appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Ceiham&quot;. Held by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury, its Domesday assets were four hides, one church, 17 ploughs, of meadow, and woodland worth 25 hogs. It rendered £14.

In the Middle Ages, Cheam had potteries, and recent excavations have been carried out by archaeologists. In 1259, Henry III of England made Cheam a town by charter. In 1538, part of Cheam was handed over to Henry VIII. The same year, Henry began work on Nonsuch Palace, which he decorated elaborately. This was later sold and demolished.

In 1801, the time of the first census, Cheam had a population of 616 Cheamonians.

Cheam was the original home of Cheam School which was formed in Whitehall in 1645 and later occupied Tabor Court from 1719 until 1934 when the school moved to Berkshire. Prince Philip attended the school in the years immediately preceding its move.

==Cheam Charter Fair==
Every year on 15 May the Cheam Charter Fair is held. It is thought to date back to 1259 when Henry III granted Cheam a charter, making it a town. Firm historical records of Cheam Charter Fair date back to the 1800s when a fairground accompanied the market.

==Cheam Village==
Cheam Village is centred on the crossroads between Sutton, North Cheam, South Cheam and Ewell.

It has a conservation area and a number of historic buildings dating back several centuries, including Nonsuch Mansion, the gabled Whitehall and Lumley Chapel, and a Georgian former rectory.

The Cheam Village Conservation Area was designated in 1970 – it covers historic parkland, housing of varying styles and age and a mock Tudor shopping area with timber detailing and leaded-lights. The entrances to Cheam Park and Nonsuch Park with its historic mansion are approximately two hundred yards from the village centre crossroads.

==North Cheam==

North Cheam is centred north, at the crossroads between Cheam Village and Worcester Park, Epsom and Morden. Victoria Junction is the centre of North Cheam. The area consists of a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket with adjoining Starbucks, a neighbouring park, a number of independent shops and restaurants, a 24-hour McDonald&#x27;s drive-thru, a post office and a Costa Coffee. There are plans to redevelop the site of a vacant 1960s building at the North Cheam crossroad and expand commercial and residential buildings. St. Anthony&#x27;s Hospital is a large private hospital in North Cheam.


==Places of note==
===Whitehall===

Whitehall is a timber framed and weatherboarded house in the centre of Cheam Village. It was originally built in about 1500 as a wattle and daub yeoman farmer&#x27;s house but has been much extended. The external weatherboard dates from the 18th century. In the garden there is a medieval well which served an earlier building on the site.

Now an historic house museum, the building features a period kitchen, and house details from the Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian eras. The museum temporarily closed in 2016 to allow for a £1.6m refurbishment of the building. It reopened in June 2018 with improved facilities.

===Cheam War Memorial===

Close to Cheam Library and the much-rebuilt Church, the memorial is to the people of Cheam who were killed during World War I, World War II and the Falklands War.

There are a number of inscriptions on the structure, including one at the 12 O&#x27;Clock Face which reads: 

It was designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage in December 2016.

===The Old Rectory===
The Old Rectory is a large part timber-framed house, built in the Tudor period, but extended and remodelled in the 18th century. It is occasionally open to the public.

===The Old Cottage===

The Old Cottage was built in the late 15th or early 16th century. Initially built as a cottage, it became a small brewery in the 18th century. It originally stood in the Broadway (then Malden Road) near the junction with Ewell Road. Under threat of demolition when the road was widened in 1922, it was saved by the local council, working with a local architect and historian.

The building was dismantled by removing the original wooden pins from the timber frame. The parts were then moved to the present site one hundred yards down the road and reassembled. The Old Cottage features a local historical plaque, and was used as a bridalwear shop before becoming a woolshop in 2022.

===The Old Farmhouse===

A large timber-framed and weatherboarded yeoman farmer&#x27;s house, forming part of the Cheam Conservation Area with St Dunstan&#x27;s Church, Whitehall, The Old Rectory and the Lumley Chapel, the Old Farmhouse has a crown post roof and large Tudor axial chimney stack in the centre with large fireplaces. The earliest part of the house is 15th century, with several building stages extending the house in the 16th and 17th centuries, creating a Baffle House design popular in the 17th century.

Many original features remain including oak doors and hinges, window shutters and fireplaces. Much of the timber framing is exposed throughout the house. Recent excavation and ground imaging uncovered a large Tudor kitchen underneath the house with a Tudor hearth and hood visible. Access to the cellar kitchen was by a staircase going north to south, which is now under the floor of the current kitchen. A file of text and images relating to the house is available in the Conservation Archive in Sutton Library.

===Nonsuch Mansion===
Nonsuch Mansion is a Grade II listed Gothic revival mansion within Nonsuch Park. The Service Wing Museum is open to the public during the summer on Sundays. It is run by the Friends of Nonsuch, which charitable organisation also commissioned the largest model of Nonsuch Palace available. The model was created by designer Ben Taggart and can be seen throughout the year on Sundays. The mansion itself is a popular place for wedding receptions, as it is available for hire. In medieval times the land upon which Nonsuch Mansion sits was part of the three thousand acre manor of Cuddington. The mansion was originally built in 1731–1743 by Joseph Thompson and later bought by Samuel Farmer in 1799. He employed Jeffry Wyattville to rebuild it in a Tudor Gothic style in 1802–1806. Farmer was succeeded by his grandson in 1838 under whom the gardens became famous.

Nonsuch Mansion bears a resemblance to the original design of Nonsuch Palace, whose construction was begun by King Henry VIII in the 16th century. Built within the north porch of the mansion is a block from the original Nonsuch Palace that bears an inscription which means &quot;1543 Henry VIII in the 35th year of His reign.&quot;

==Places of worship==

St Dunstan&#x27;s Church is the area&#x27;s parish church, situated in Cheam Village, next to Lumley Chapel. St Paul&#x27;s Howell Hill is on Northey Avenue at the far west of the town, although it is actually in the borough of Epsom and Ewell. It is known locally due to its prominent presence on a roundabout and its contemporary design. Towards the eastern end of Northey Avenue is St Andrew&#x27;s United Reformed Church, a grade II listed building designed by Maxwell Ayrton in 1933. Cheam Baptist Church is located next to St Dunstan&#x27;s Church. Cheam Methodist Church is in the east of the town just off the A217 and is also home to Sutton Schoolswork, the local Christian schools charity working in the borough of Sutton.

===St Dunstan&#x27;s Church===
The parish church of St. Dunstan is Grade II* listed. It was built in Cheam Village in 1864 next to Lumley Chapel on the site of a medieval church. It was built with Kentish ragstone below pitched slate roofs, with dressings to windows and doors in Bath Stone. It was designed by F. H. Pownall in the Gothic revival architectural style, and features polychrome brickwork decoration internally. The lychgate, dated 1891, at the entrance to the churchyard, is listed Grade II. In the churchyard are three tombs which are Grade II listed.
The graveyard attached to this church was twice subject to a archaeological excavation by the police, first between June and September 2012, and again from April 2013. This excavation was conducted in order to uncover evidence in the investigation into the unsolved disappearance of Lee Boxell, a fifteen-year-old local schoolboy, in 1988. The church was home to an informal youth club in the 1980s, known as &#x27;The Shed&#x27;.

===Lumley Chapel===
Situated next to St Dunstan&#x27;s Church, Lumley Chapel is the oldest standing building in the London Borough of Sutton, and contains many notable monuments to local families.

Following the construction of the new St Dunstan&#x27;s church in 1864, the older church on the site was demolished, other than the east end of the chancel, which was retained to contain the monuments and brasses from the old church. This remnant of the former church is now known as the Lumley Chapel. It is constructed in partly roughcast rubble stone and brick, and has a gabled tile roof. The east window dates from the 15th century and has three lights. In the south wall is the blocked arcade that formerly led into the south chapel.

The remnant was declared &quot;redundant&quot; in 2002, and vested in the Churches Conservation Trust. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of a national charity, the Churches Conservation Trust.
==Demography==
38.2% of homes in Cheam are detached houses, 23% are semi-detached, 20.6% are flats/maisonettes/apartments, and 18.6% are terraced.

==Schools==
There are a number of schools in Cheam, including Nonsuch High School, a grammar school for girls and Cheam High School, a large mixed comprehensive school on Chatsworth Road.

Primary schools include Cuddington Croft, St Cecilias Catholic Primary School, Cheam Fields Primary, Cheam Common Primary, Cheam Park Farm Nursery and Infants School, Cheam Park Farm Juniors, Nonsuch Primary and St. Dunstans Church of England Primary.

==Transport==

Cheam is served by Cheam station on the Sutton and Mole Valley lines between Sutton and Epsom. It is in Travelcard Zone 5. Services from Cheam to central London include direct trains to Victoria which take about 30 minutes.

In 1910, parliamentary approval was given to the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway to construct a station at Cheam Road, Sutton that would have been served by the London Underground&#x27;s District Railway. Following negotiations between the Underground Electric Railways Company of London and the Southern Railway, the line was eventually opened in 1930 by the Southern Railway, though the station was replaced by West Sutton to its north.

In 1946, a report on London&#x27;s railways to the Ministry of War Transport detailed possible new routes and rail lines for the London Underground, including the Victoria line and a route that would serve similar stations to Crossrail. The same report recommended extending the Northern line to North Cheam, contingent on doubling the tracks between Kennington and Tooting Broadway such that Charing Cross trains would terminate at Tooting Broadway, and with an intermediate station at Morden South. Both proposals would each have cost £1,500,000. The proposed site for North Cheam station would have occupied the site of what was then a Granada cinema on London Road in North Cheam, which was opened in 1937 and closed in 1969; one half was demolished to make way for a community centre car park, and the other half of which is now a Wetherspoons pub. However, as no detailed planning and application was made for permission to construct the extension — by the report&#x27;s own admission, &quot;the period required for construction, under the most favourable conditions, would not be less than 30 years&quot; — the extension to North Cheam did not take place.

Cheam and North Cheam are served by bus routes including services 213 (Sutton to Kingston), 151 (Wallington to Worcester Park), 93 (North Cheam to Putney Bridge) and the SL7 service between Heathrow Airport and Croydon.

==Sport and recreation==

Cheam is mainly built up, but retains Cheam Park and Nonsuch Park.

Nonsuch Park is home to a historic building, Nonsuch Mansion which contains a cafe and extensive flower gardens. Nonsuch also extends into Stoneleigh and East Ewell.

Cheam Park contains tennis courts, football pitches and a children&#x27;s playground. A cafe can be found in the middle of the park.

Cheam Leisure Centre, on Malden Road, has facilities including a swimming pool (30m x 12m), squash courts and fitness gym.

Cheam Rovers F.C. is a local football club.

Cheam Cricket Club play at Peaches Close.

Cheam Hockey Club is a field hockey club that competes in the London Hockey League.

==Cheam in popular culture==

In the comedy show &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, Tony Hancock lived in the fictional road Railway Cuttings, in East Cheam. Though not in existence today, East Cheam did exist officially in name and was not fictional. The census of 1841 includes the place-names East Cheam, North Cheam, Garden Green and Cheam Common.

Cheam is referred to in a rhyme dating back to the 18th century, and revised in the Victorian era to:

&quot;Sutton for good mutton;
Cheam for juicy beef;
Croydon for a pretty girl
And Mitcham for a thief.&quot;

St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church was used in an episode of the TV comedy &quot;The I.T. Crowd&quot;, Series 2 (&quot;Return of the Golden Child&quot;).

Scenes from an episode of &quot;Made in Chelsea&quot; were filmed in Nonsuch Mansion.

== Disappearance of Lee Boxell ==
Lee Boxell, a 15-year-old schoolboy, disappeared near his home in Cheam on 10 September 1988. He was last seen outside of the then-Tesco supermarket (now an ASDA store) at 2:20 pm. The case remains unsolved. It was featured in the national press and on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Crimewatch&quot;.

<text>Chessington is an area in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames within Greater London, which was historically part of Surrey. At the 2011 census it had a population of 18,973. The Bonesgate Stream, a tributary of the Hogsmill River, runs through it. The popular theme park resort Chessington World of Adventures, which incorporates Chessington Zoo, is located in the south-west of the area.

Neighbouring settlements include Tolworth, Ewell, Surbiton, Claygate, Epsom, Oxshott, Leatherhead, Esher, Kingston upon Thames, Worcester Park and Malden Rushett.

==History==
Its name came from Anglo-Saxon &quot;Cissan dūn&quot; = &quot;hill belonging to [a man named] Cissa&quot;.

Chessington appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cisedune&quot; and &quot;Cisendone&quot;. It was held partly by Robert de Wateville and partly by Milo (Miles) Crispin. Its Domesday assets were: 1½ hides; part of a mill worth 2s, 4 ploughs, woodland worth 30 hogs. It rendered £7.

The mansion at Chessington World of Adventures, known today as the Burnt Stub, was originally built in 1348. In the English Civil War it became a royalist stronghold and was razed to the ground by Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s Parliamentary forces, giving it its modern name. The site became an inn and was then rebuilt on a grander scale from the 18th century by the Vere Barker family in a Neo-Gothic Victorian style. The grounds were turned into a zoo in 1931 by Reginald Goddard. Chessington Zoo became part of the Tussauds Group in 1978 and is now operated as a theme park. Burnt Stub had no public access until 2003 when it became an attraction called Hocus Pocus Hall.

thumb|Map of Chessington in the 1880s 
Chessington Hall has a place in 18th-century literary history, as home of Samuel Crisp, a failed playwright and close friend of Fanny Burney. Chessington Road Recreation Ground was purchased on 16 October 1930 for £1,000.

At 207 Hook Road is a Blue plaque commemorating the author Enid Blyton, who lived at the address between 1920 and 1924.

The former farmhouse Barwell Court (on Barwell Lane) was used as a recording and residential studio during the 1970s through to the 1990s. 

The former RAF Chessington Hospital, demolished in the 1990s, first opened as RAF Hook around 1938 as a regional barrage balloon depot and was operated by RAF Balloon Command. It became a vital part of Britain&#x27;s defence against the Luftwaffe in World War II, and originally featured a number of large barrage balloon sheds as well as extensive garages and workshops for the station&#x27;s support vehicles.

The main secondary school in Chessington is a mixed public school called Chessington School, but nearby secondary schools on the northern border of Chessington are the boys&#x27; school Southborough High School in Surbiton and Tolworth Girls&#x27; School and Centre for Continuing Education in Tolworth.

There are also many primary schools, e.g., Lovelace Primary, Ellingham Primary School.

==Transport==
There are trains, busses and taxis.

===Rail===
[[Chessington North railway station]] 
Chessington has two railway stations: Chessington North and Chessington South. They are half a mile apart with South Western Railway services every half-hour to London Waterloo. Chessington South is the end of the line. 

The line past Chessington South has fallen into heavy disrepair and leads over a concrete bridge into a patch of full-grown trees. The crossover, signal, and rail electricity at this point are still active, even though a passenger train has never passed over this section.

===Roads===
Chessington is about four miles (6 km) from junction 9 of the M25 motorway. The town is situated on the A243 Leatherhead Road, close to the A3 London-to-Portsmouth trunk route to the north. The un-numbered Bridge Road runs through the area from the A243 toward the adjacent district of West Ewell, in the neighbouring borough of Epsom and Ewell (the boundary being marked crossing the course of the Bonesgate Stream).

===Buses===
The Chessington area is served by a number of daily bus services, such as routes 71, 465, 467, night route 65 and local routes K2 and K4. It is also served by the school service 671.

<doc id="93927" wikidata="Q3778007" url="?curid=93927" title="Chingford">
<text>Chingford is a suburban town in east London, England, within the London Borough of Waltham Forest. The centre of Chingford is north-east of Charing Cross, with Waltham Abbey to the north, Woodford Green and Buckhurst Hill to the east, Walthamstow to the south, and Edmonton and Enfield to the west. It had a population of 70,583 at the 2021 census.

Historically an ancient parish in the Waltham hundred of Essex, the town expanded significantly from the late 19th century, forming part of the conurbation of London. It was included in the Metropolitan Police District in 1840 and became part of London&#x27;s postal district upon its inception in 1856, with the NE postcode area replaced with E in 1866. The parish was granted urban district status in 1894, and municipal borough status in 1938. Its administrative headquarters were at Chingford Town Hall until 1965 when Chingford merged with Walthamstow and Leyton to form a new borough, Waltham Forest within Greater London.

==Toponymy==
The River Ching runs through the area, and the town of Chingford is close to a number of fords of that river. However, old maps and descriptions give a name for the settlement long before the river has a name and it is likely that the name of the river as &quot;Ching&quot; arose long after the settlement was named. The alternative view is that the ford crossed the Lea, and a location near Cook&#x27;s Ferry has been suggested.

The area of Chingford is referenced in the Domesday book as &quot;Cingefort&quot; from 1066AD. It is thought that, similarly to how Kingston upon Thames appears in Domesday Book of 1086AD as Chingestone and Chingetun(e), with &quot;ching&quot; being old English for the king, that Chingford could refer to the King&#x27;s river, and Kings Ford. This idea is compounded by links to royalty using the area for hunting in centuries gone by, with Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge still standing in North Chingford. Furthermore, there is evidence of King Harold Harefoot having lived in Chingford and the environs in the 11th century, a date which ties in with the Old English use of &quot;Ching&quot; for King.

Another suggested explanation by place name genealogists is that the settlement&#x27;s name has its origin as &quot;Shingly Ford&quot;—that is, a ford over a waterway containing shingles. However, the genealogists&#x27; assertion is likely to be incorrect, as the usage of the placename name &quot;Cingefort&quot; in the Doomsday book predates the coining of the word &quot;Shingle.&quot; The earliest known usage of the Middle English word shingle is 1200AD and the word was not used to describe loose stones on a waterway until three centuries later in the 1500s.

A further possibility derives from the form &quot;Chagingeford&quot; recorded in 1204, which may mean &quot;the ford of the dwellers by the stumps&quot;. The ford over the Lea may have been at Cook&#x27;s Ferry. The remains of pile dwellings, covering a considerable area, were found near the mouth of the Ching between 1869 and 1901, when the reservoirs were being built.

==Geography==
The area covered by the former ancient parish and subsequent Municipal Borough of Chingford includes Chingford Green, Chingford Hatch, Chingford Mount, Friday Hill, North Chingford and South Chingford. 

==History==

Chingford Station opened in 1873 and brought with it a huge increase in visitors to the area, many of whom used the town as a gateway to Epping Forest.

The forest was given to the people by Queen Victoria in 1878 under the Epping Forest Act, which ensured it was kept free and unenclosed for the public to use.

The Royal Forest Hotel opened in 1880, and its location in Ranger&#x27;s Road meant it soon became popular among day-trippers visiting Epping Forest.

It is situated next to the historic Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge, which the royal family used while hunting deer in the forest during the 1600s.

At the other end of Station Road, the King&#x27;s Head Hotel dates back to at least the 1730s and it received a boost in trade as more people visited the area.
It is still a popular hotel and has recently been refurbished inside, although the exterior of the building still preserves the character of its early days.

==Landmarks==

One notable local landmark is Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge. Originally called the Great Standing, it was built for King Henry VIII in 1543, and was used as a grandstand to watch the hunting of deer, although it has been heavily altered over time. The building is located on Chingford Plain within Epping Forest and is open to the public. The lodge is preserved under the Epping Forest Preservation Act.

Originally a barn built in the mid-19th century, Butler&#x27;s Retreat, a Grade II listed building, is one of the few remaining Victorian retreats within the forest. The building is adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hunting Lodge and takes its name from the 1891 occupier John Butler. Retreats originally served non-alcoholic refreshments as part of the Temperance movement. After closing in 2009 the building was refurbished by the City of London Corporation and re-opened as a cafe in 2012.
Friday Hill House, Simmons Lane, off Friday Hill, dating from 1839, was a manor house built and owned by Robert Boothby Heathcote, who was both the lord of the manor and rector of the local church. It was he who paid for the building of the church of St Peter and St Paul in Chingford. He is buried in the Boothby family vault in All Saints&#x27; Churchyard (Chingford Old Church), Old Church Road. The vault was purchased by Robert Boothby (died 1733), who lived in the previous manor house. The present building has been used as a further education centre but was put up for sale in 2012.

Pimp Hall Dovecote is situated in a green area at the bottom of Friday Hill and can be viewed by entering the Pimp Hall Nature Reserve. The dovecote, which had nesting space for 250 birds, belonged to Pimp Hall (originally Pympe&#x27;s Hall), one of three manor houses around Chingford. In 1838 the estate was taken over and became part of the Chingford Earls estate. The farmhouse associated with it survived until just before World War II. This dovecote is depicted in the Millennium Heritage Mosaic on the front of Chingford Assembly Hall. It is the fourth item down on the left-hand side of the mosaic, also see the Key. There is a local legend telling how on one occasion Charles II was out hunting in Epping Forest and was caught in a snowstorm. He took shelter in Pimp Hall and was so delighted with the food offered him that he jocularly drew his sword and knighted the joint of beef declaring that it was now Sir Loin. Either this story caused the nearby pub on Friday Hill to be called &quot;The Sirloin&quot; or vice versa.

A granite obelisk at Pole Hill was erected in 1824 under the direction of the Astronomer Royal, the Rev. John Pond M.A., to mark true north for the telescopes of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, south of the Thames. It was placed on high ground along the line of the Greenwich Meridian, but when this was recalibrated later in the 19th century, the obelisk was deemed to have been erected west of the revised meridian line. Today, an adjoining triangulation pillar marks the modern line.
Chingford Town Hall, dating from 1929, is on The Ridgeway in Chingford. It has more recently been known as the Chingford Municipal Offices. The site was sold to property developers who built blocks of flats on the land and the town hall building was subsequently converted to apartments.

==Churches==
All Saints&#x27; Church in Chingford Mount (known locally as the Old Church) is a Grade II* listed Church of England church at Old Church Road. Parts of the church date back to the 12th and 13th centuries, but it now forms part of the parish of St Peter and St Paul, Chingford, which took over its role as the parish church in 1844. The church stands on the summit of Chingford Mount and has views westwards towards the reservoirs of the Lea Valley. Directly opposite the church is Chingford Mount Cemetery.

The Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Grace &amp; Saint Teresa of Avila is on the corner of Kings Road and Station Road, next to St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School. The current half-timbered building dates from 1931, on the site of an earlier 1919 church.

Each ward is represented by three councillors, except Endlebury and Highams Park &amp; Hale End South, which each have two. Currently all of the councillors represent the Conservative Party except for one Labour councillor in Valley and two in Hale End and Highams Park South. The London Borough of Waltham Forest is presently controlled by the Labour party.

Chingford and Waltham Forest fall within the North East constituency of the London Assembly, represented since 2004 by Jennette Arnold of the Labour party.

Until 1965, the town formed the core of the Municipal Borough of Chingford. Historically a rural parish, it gained urban district status in 1894, and between 1938 and 1965 held municipal borough status.

When Chingford was a municipal borough, before 1965, its politics were dominated by the Chingford Ratepayers&#x27; Association, which was nominally independent, but against whom the Conservative Party did not field candidates.

==Demography==
As of the 2021 census, the population of Chingford was 70,583, an increase from 66,211 in 2011.

<text>Chislehurst () is a suburban district of south-east London, England, in the London Borough of Bromley. It lies east of Bromley, south-west of Sidcup and north-west of Orpington, south-east of Charing Cross. Before the creation of Greater London in 1965, it was in Kent. According to the 2021 census, Chislehurst has a population of 15,600 (rounded to the nearest 100).

==History==

The name &quot;Chislehurst&quot; is derived from the Saxon words &quot;cisel&quot;, &quot;gravel&quot;, and &quot;hyrst&quot;, &quot;wooded hill&quot;.

The Walsingham family, including Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s patron, Sir Thomas Walsingham and Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s spymaster, Francis Walsingham, had a home in Scadbury Park, now a nature reserve in which the ruins of the house can still be seen.

A water tower used to straddle the road from Chislehurst to Bromley until it was demolished in 1963 as one of the last acts of the Chislehurst and Sidcup UDC. It marked the entrance to the Wythes Estate in Bickley, but its narrow archway meant that double-decker buses were not able to be used on the route.

==Governance==
The Chislehurst civil parish formed an urban district of Kent from 1894 to 1934. In 1934 it became part of the Chislehurst and Sidcup Urban District, which was split in 1965 between the London boroughs of Bromley and Bexley. Chislehurst Ward has three councillors on Bromley Council: the first non-Conservative party candidates returned for the ward were Chislehurst Matters members elected in 2022.

== Demographics ==
As of 2021, Chislehurst is recorded as having a population of roughly 15,600. 35.3% of people in Chislehurst were recorded as being between the ages of 35 and 59, below the borough average of 36.4%. The largest religious group is Christian at 51.5%, above the borough average of 48.3%, with the second largest group being No religion at 33.8%, below the borough average of 37.3%. The largest ethnic group in Chislehurst is White, comprising 81.4% of the population, above the borough average of 76.5%, with the second largest being Asian/Asian British who make up 7.9% of the population, below the borough average of 8.3%.

==Geography==
Chislehurst is largely a residential area. Chislehurst West, previously known as &quot;Pricking&quot; or &quot;Prickend&quot;, includes the biggest of the ponds and the High Street.

Chislehurst is one of the starting points for the Green Chain Walk, linking to places such as Crystal Palace, Erith, the Thames Barrier and Thamesmead.

Chislehurst Common (and nearby St Paul&#x27;s Cray Common) were saved from development in 1888 following campaigns by local residents. They were a popular destination for bank holiday trips in the early 20th century, and now provide a valuable green space. Nearby Petts Wood, Hawkwood and Scadbury have also been preserved as open spaces following local campaigns.

===Chislehurst Conservation Area===

A 2017 list shows there have been in Chislehurst designated as conservation areas since 1971. The designation of conservation areas is one of the many planning tactics used in the United Kingdom that includes local planning authorities (LPA&#x27;s), with plans working in conjunction such as the listing of buildings and scheduled monuments, metropolitan Green Belts, National Trusts, and &quot;Tree Preservation Orders&quot;. These give stringent policies against development with statues and non-statutory orders. The destruction of many trees and Victorian style buildings caused by bombing during WWII, as well as the ensuing building boom, made protection even more critical. The result is the protection of areas by preventing arbitrary destruction from large as well as small-scale development that can cause a creeping effect into side spaces and back gardens.

===Nearby areas===
Chislehurst borders New Eltham to the north, Sidcup to the north east and east, St Paul&#x27;s Cray to the south east, Petts Wood to the south, Bickley to the south west, Elmstead to the west and Mottingham to the north west.

==Landmarks==

===Chislehurst Caves===

A local attraction is Chislehurst Caves. They were originally used to mine flint and chalk. During World War II, they were used nightly as an air-raid shelter. There is a chapel inside. A child was born in the caves during World War II and was given a middle name of &#x27;Cavena&#x27;. The caves have also been used as a venue for live music; Jimi Hendrix, the Who, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin have all played there.

===Camden Place===

Camden Place (now Chislehurst Golf Club, 51° 24′ 40.05″N 0° 3′ 55.69″E ) takes its name from the antiquary William Camden, who lived in the former house on the site from until his death in 1623. The present house was built shortly before 1717, and it was given a number of additions in the late 18th and very early 19th centuries by the architect George Dance the younger.

In about 1760, the house and estate were bought by Charles Pratt, the Attorney General, and later Lord Chancellor. Pratt was ennobled in 1765, taking the title Baron Camden, of Camden Place; in 1786, he was created Earl Camden. The house is a Grade II* listed building.

A later occupant of the house, from 1871 until his death there in 1873, was the exiled French Emperor, Napoleon III. His body and that of his son, the Prince Imperial, were originally buried in St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church, before being removed to St Michael&#x27;s Abbey, Farnborough. The Emperor&#x27;s widow, the Empress Eugénie, remained at Camden Place until 1885.

There is a memorial to the Prince Imperial on Chislehurst Common, and the area&#x27;s connections with the imperial family are found in many road names and in the local telephone code, 467, which in its earlier format corresponded to the letters IMP (for &quot;imperial&quot;).

===War Memorial===

The Chislehurst War Memorial was dedicated on 17 October 1920. It commemorates the fallen of World War I and World War II.

==Transport==
===Rail===
Chislehurst station provides National Rail services to London Charing Cross, London Cannon Street via Lewisham, Orpington and Sevenoaks.

===Bus===
Chislehurst is served by London Buses routes 61, 160, 161, 162, 269, 273, R7, SL3 and N136. These connect it with areas including Beckenham, Bexleyheath, Bromley, Catford, Eltham, Grove Park, Lewisham, North Greenwich, Orpington, Sidcup and Woolwich.

<text>Chiswick ( ) is a district in West London, split between the London Boroughs of Hounslow and Ealing. It contains Hogarth&#x27;s House, the former residence of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth, Chiswick House, a neo-Palladian villa regarded as one of the finest in England and Fuller&#x27;s Brewery, London&#x27;s largest and oldest brewery. In a meander of the River Thames used for competitive and recreational rowing, with several rowing clubs on the river bank, the finishing post for the Boat Race is just downstream of Chiswick Bridge.

Old Chiswick was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex, with an agrarian and fishing economy beside the river; from the Early Modern period, the wealthy built imposing riverside houses on Chiswick Mall. Having good communications with London, Chiswick became a popular country retreat and part of the suburban growth of London in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was made the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick in 1932 and part of Greater London in 1965, when it merged into the London Borough of Hounslow. Modern Chiswick is an affluent area which includes the early garden suburb Bedford Park, Grove Park, the Glebe Estate, Strand-on-the-Green and tube stations Chiswick Park, Turnham Green, and Stamford Brook, as well as the Gunnersbury Triangle local nature reserve. Some parts of Bedford Park and Acton Green are in the Chiswick W4 postcode area but the London Borough of Ealing. The main shopping and dining centre is Chiswick High Road.

Chiswick Roundabout is the start of the North Circular Road (A406). At Hogarth Roundabout, the Great West Road from central London becomes the M4 motorway, while the Great Chertsey Road (A316) runs south-west, becoming the M3 motorway.

People who have lived in Chiswick include the poets Alexander Pope and W. B. Yeats, the Italian poet and revolutionary Ugo Foscolo, the painters Vincent van Gogh and Camille Pissarro, the novelist E. M. Forster, the rock musicians Pete Townshend, John Entwistle, and Phil Collins, the stage director Peter Brook, and the actress Imogen Poots.

== History ==

Chiswick was first recorded 1000 as the Old English &quot;Ceswican&quot; meaning &#x27;Cheese Farm&#x27;; the riverside area of Duke&#x27;s Meadows is thought to have supported an annual cheese fair up until the 18th century. The area was settled in Roman times; an urn found at Turnham Green contained Roman coins, and Roman brickwork was found under the Sutton manor house.

Old Chiswick grew up as a village around St Nicholas Church from on Church Street, its inhabitants practising farming, fishing and other riverside trades including a ferry, important as there were no bridges between London Bridge and Kingston throughout the Middle Ages. The area included three other small settlements, the fishing village of Strand-on-the-Green, the hamlet of Little Sutton in the centre, and Turnham Green on the west road out of London.

A decisive skirmish took place on Turnham Green early in the English Civil War. In November 1642, royalist forces under Prince Rupert, marching from Oxford to retake London, were halted by a larger parliamentarian force under the Earl of Essex. The royalists retreated and never again threatened the capital.

From 1758 until 1929 the Dukes of Devonshire owned Chiswick House, and their legacy can be found in street names all over Chiswick.

In 1864, John Isaac Thornycroft, founder of the John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company shipbuilding company, established a yard at Church Wharf at the west end of Chiswick Mall. The shipyard built the first naval destroyer, of the Daring class, in 1893. To cater for the increasing size of warships, Thornycroft moved its shipyard to Southampton in 1909.

In 1822, the Royal Horticultural Society leased of land in the area south of the High Road between what are now Sutton Court Road and Duke&#x27;s Avenue. This site was used for its fruit tree collection and its first school of horticulture, and housed its first flower shows. The area was reduced to in the 1870s, and the lease was terminated when the Society&#x27;s garden at Wisley, Surrey, was set up in 1904. Some of the original pear trees still grow in the gardens of houses built on the site.

The population of Chiswick grew almost tenfold during the 19th century, reaching 29,809 in 1901, and the area is a mixture of Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian housing. Suburban building began in Gunnersbury in the 1860s and in Bedford Park, the first garden suburb, on the borders of Chiswick and Acton, in 1875.

During the Second World War, Chiswick was bombed repeatedly, with both incendiary and high explosive bombs. Falling anti-aircraft shells and shrapnel also caused damage. The first V-2 rocket to hit London fell on Staveley Road, Chiswick, at 6.43pm on 8 September 1944, killing three people, injuring 22 others and causing extensive damage to surrounding trees and buildings. Six houses were demolished by the rocket and many more suffered damage. There is a memorial where the rocket fell on Staveley Road, and a War Memorial at the east end of Turnham Green. 

Refuge was founded in 1971 in Chiswick, as the modern world&#x27;s first safe house for women and children escaping domestic violence.

By the start of the 21st century, Chiswick had become an affluent suburb.

== Governance ==

Chiswick St Nicholas was an ancient, and later civil, parish in the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. Until 1834 its vestry governed most parish affairs. After the Poor Law Amendment Act (1834), local administration in Chiswick began to be devolved to authorities beyond the vestry. Then, Chiswick poor relief was administered by the Brentford Poor Law Union. Briefly, from 1849 to 1855, responsibility for Chiswick drains and sewers passed to the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers under its &#x27;Fulham and Hammersmith Sewer District.&#x27; From 1858, under the Chiswick Improvement Act of that year, responsibility for drains and sewers, paving and lighting was vested in an elected board of eighteen Improvement Commissioners. This operated as Chiswick&#x27;s secular local authority for a quarter of a century until its replacement with a Local Board in 1883. In 1878 the parish gained a triangle of land in the east which had formed a detached part of Ealing. From 1894 to 1927 the parish formed the Chiswick Urban District. In 1927 it was abolished and its former area was merged with that of Brentford Urban District to form Brentford and Chiswick Urban District. The amalgamated district became a municipal borough in 1932. The borough of Brentford and Chiswick was abolished in 1965, and its former area was transferred to Greater London to form part of the London Borough of Hounslow. With these changes, Chiswick Town Hall is no longer the local government centre but remains an approved venue for marriage and civil partnership ceremonies.
Chiswick forms part of the Brentford and Isleworth Parliament constituency, having been part of the Brentford and Chiswick constituency between 1918 and 1974. The Member of Parliament (MP) is Ruth Cadbury (Labour), elected at the May 2015 general election replacing Mary Macleod (Conservative). For elections to the London Assembly Chiswick is in the South West constituency, represented since 2000 by Tony Arbour, of the Conservative Party. For elections to Hounslow London Borough Council, Chiswick is represented by three electoral wards: Turnham Green, Chiswick Homefields and Chiswick Riverside. Each ward elects three councillors, who serve four-year terms. For 2010–14, all nine councillors were Conservatives. It was one of 35 major centres identified in the statutory planning document of Greater London, the London Plan of 2008.

== Geography ==


Chiswick occupies a meander of the River Thames, west of Charing Cross. The district is built up towards the north with more open space in the south, including the grounds of Chiswick House and Duke&#x27;s Meadows. Chiswick has one main shopping area, the Chiswick High Road, forming a long high street in the north, with additional shops on Turnham Green Terrace and Devonshire Road. The river forms the southern boundary with Kew, including North Sheen, Mortlake and Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. It includes the uninhabited island of Chiswick Eyot, joined to the mainland at low tide. In the east Goldhawk Road and British Grove border Hammersmith in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. In the north are Bedford Park (like Chiswick, within the London W4 postcode area) and South Acton in the London Borough of Ealing, with a boundary partially delineated by the District line. On the west, within Hounslow, are the districts of Gunnersbury, which is within the bounds of the early 19th century parish of Chiswick, and Brentford. A short distance south of the High Road in the centre of Chiswick is the Glebe Estate, consisting of small terraced houses built in the 1870s on glebe land once owned by the local church, and now a desirable place to live.
Chiswick is in the W4 postcode district of the London post town, which in a tribute to its ancient parish includes Bedford Park and Acton Green, mostly within the London Borough of Ealing.

Some of the most beautiful period mansion blocks in Chiswick, such as Heathfield Court and Arlington Mansions, line the sides of Turnham Green – the site of the Battle of Turnham Green in 1642. Other suburbs of Chiswick include Grove Park (south of the A4, close to Chiswick railway station) and Strand on the Green, a fishing hamlet until the late 18th century. As early as 1896, Bedford Park was advertised as being in Chiswick, though at that time much of it was in Acton.

== Economy ==

Chiswick High Road contains a mix of retail shops, restaurants, food outlets and office and hotel space. The wide streets encourage cafes, pubs and restaurants to provide pavement seating. Lying between the offices at the Golden Mile Great West Road and Hammersmith, office developments and warehouse conversions to offices began from the 1960s. The first in 1961 was 414 Chiswick High Road on the site of the old Chiswick Empire. Between 1964 and 1966, the 18-storey IBM headquarters was built above Gunnersbury station, designed to accommodate 1500 people. It became the home of the British Standards Institution in 1994. Chiswick has an annual book festival.

Chiswick is home to the Griffin Brewery, where Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner and its predecessor companies brewed their prize-winning ales on the same site for over 350 years. The original brewery was in the gardens of Bedford House in Chiswick Mall.

A weekly farmers&#x27; market is held every Sunday by Grove Park Farm House, Duke&#x27;s Meadows. A monthly flower market is held on the first Sunday of each month on Chiswick High Road in the old market place, now mostly used as a car park, near the Hogarth statue. An antiques market is to be held on the second Sunday of each month, and a &quot;Cheese and Provisions&quot; market with 23 stalls on the third and fourth Sundays of each month in the same area, so there will in effect be a weekly market event on the High Road once again.

== Points of interest ==

=== Chiswick House ===

Chiswick House was designed by the Third Earl of Burlington, and built for him, in 1726–29 as an extension to an earlier Jacobean house (subsequently demolished in 1788); it is considered to be among the finest surviving examples of Palladian architecture in Britain, with superb collections of paintings and furniture. Its surrounding grounds, laid out by William Kent, are among the most important historical gardens in England and Wales, forming one of the first English landscape gardens. It was used as an asylum from 1892 to 1928; up to 40 private patients were housed in wings which were demolished in 1956 when the house was restored.

=== Churches ===

St Nicholas Church, near the river Thames, has a 15th-century tower, although the remainder of the church was rebuilt by J.L. Pearson in 1882–84. Monuments in the churchyard mark the burial sites of the 18th-century English artist William Hogarth and William Kent, the architect and landscape designer; the churchyard also houses a mausoleum (for Philip James de Loutherbourg) designed by John Soane, and the tomb of Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s business partner, Thomas Bentley, designed by Thomas Scheemakers. One of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s daughters, Mary Fauconberg, lived at Sutton Court and is buried in the churchyard. Enduring legend has it that the body of Oliver Cromwell was also interred with her, though as the Fauconbergs did not move to Sutton Court until 15 years after his disinterment, it is more likely he was reburied at their home at Newburgh Priory. Private Frederick Hitch VC, hero of Rorke&#x27;s Drift, is also buried there.

The church of St Michael, Sutton Court was designed by W. D. Caröe in 1908–1909. It is a red brick building on Elmwood road, in Tudor style. St Paul&#x27;s Church, Grove Park is a Gothic style stone building designed by H. Currey. It was built largely at the Duke of Devonshire&#x27;s expense in 1872.
St Michael and All Angels, Bedford Park was initially a temporary iron building from 1876 on Chiswick High Road facing Chiswick Lane. The current building&#x27;s foundation stone was laid in 1879 and consecrated in 1880. It was designed, along with much of Bedford Park, by Norman Shaw, and was called &quot;a very lovely church&quot; by John Betjeman. It is an Anglo-Catholic church, and was attacked on the day it was consecrated for &quot;Popish and Pagan mummeries&quot; by the brewer Henry Smith, churchwarden of St Nicholas, Chiswick.

Christ Church, Turnham Green is an early Victorian Gothic building of flint with stone dressings. The main part of the building, by George Gilbert Scott and W. B. Moffat, is from 1843; the chancel and northeast chapel were added in 1887 by J. Brooks.

Chiswick&#x27;s principal Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Grace and St Edward (the Confessor) in the Diocese of Westminster, lies on the corner of Duke&#x27;s Avenue and the High Road. It is a red brick building; the parish was founded in 1848, a school began c. 1855, and a church was opened by Cardinal Wiseman on the present site in 1864. It was replaced by the present building in 1886, opened by Cardinal Manning. The heavy debts incurred were paid off and the church consecrated in 1904. The square tower was added after the First World War by Canon Egan as a war memorial.

The Cathedral of the Nativity of the Most Holy Mother of God and the Holy Royal Martyrs with its characteristic blue onion dome with gold stars is in Harvard Road. The Russian Orthodox church built it in 1998.

=== Chiswick Mall ===

Chiswick Mall is a waterfront street on the north bank of the River Thames in the oldest part of Chiswick near St Nicholas Church. It consists mainly of some thirty &quot;grand houses&quot; from the Georgian and Victorian eras, many of them now listed buildings, overlooking the street on the north side; their gardens are on the other side of the street beside the river. The largest and finest house on the street is Walpole House, a Grade I listed building; part of it is Tudor, but the building now visible is late 17th to early 18th century.

=== Strand-on-the-Green ===

Strand-on-the-Green is the most westerly part of Chiswick, &quot;particularly picturesque&quot; with a paved riverside path fronted by a row of &quot;imposing&quot; 18th-century houses, interspersed with three riverside pubs, the Bell and Crown, Bull’s Head, and the City Barge. The low-lying path is flooded at high tides. It became fashionable in 1759 when Kew Bridge opened just upstream, with the royal family at Kew Palace nearby.

=== Bedford Park ===

The Bedford Park neighbourhood was described by Nikolaus Pevsner as the first place &quot;where the relaxed, informal mood of a market town or village was adopted for a complete speculatively built suburb&quot;. In 1877 the speculator Jonathan Carr hired Shaw as his estate architect. Shaw&#x27;s house designs, in the Queen Anne Revival style with red brick, roughcast, decorative gables, and both oriel and dormer windows, gave the impression of great variety using only a few types of house. These were scaled-down versions of the more expensive houses that he had designed for wealthy areas such as Chelsea, Hampstead, and Kensington. He also designed the focal buildings of the garden suburb, including the church of St Michael and All Angels and the Tabard Inn opposite it.

=== Duke&#x27;s Meadows ===

Duke&#x27;s Meadows stands on land formerly owned by the Duke of Devonshire. In the 1920s, it was purchased by the local council, who developed it as a recreational centre. A promenade and bandstand were built, and the meadows are still used for sport with a rugby club, football pitches, hockey club, several rowing clubs and a golf club. In recent years a local conservation charity, the Dukes Meadows Trust, has undertaken extensive restoration work, which saw a long-term project of a children&#x27;s water play area opened in August 2006.

=== Gunnersbury Triangle ===

The Gunnersbury Triangle local nature reserve, opposite Chiswick Park Underground station, is managed by London Wildlife Trust. The area, a railway triangle, was saved from development by a public inquiry, and became a reserve in 1985. Its 2.5 hectares are covered mainly in secondary birch woodland, with willow carr (wet woodland) in the low-lying centre, and acid grassland on the former Acton Curve railway track. The reserve runs a varied programme of activities including wildlife walks, fungus forays, open days and talks.

=== Public houses and theatres ===

There are several historic public houses in Chiswick, some of them listed buildings, including the Mawson Arms, the George and Devonshire, the Old Packhorse and The Tabard in Bath Road near Turnham Green station. The Tabard is known for its William Morris interior and its Norman Shaw exterior; it was built in 1880. Three more pubs are in Strand-on-the-Green, fronting on to the Thames river path.

Chiswick had two well-known theatres in the 20th century. The Chiswick Empire (1912 to 1959) was at 414 Chiswick High Road. It had 2,140 seats, and staged music hall entertainment, plays, reviews, opera, ballet and an annual Christmas pantomime. The Q Theatre (1924 to 1959) was a small theatre opposite Kew Bridge station. It staged the first works of Terence Rattigan and William Douglas-Home, and many of its plays went on to the West End.

The 96-seat Tabard Theatre (1985) in Bath Road, upstairs from the Tabard pub but a separate business, is known for new writing and experimental work.

=== Other buildings ===


The Sanderson Factory in Barley Mow Passage, now known as Voysey House, was designed by the architect Charles Voysey in 1902. It is built in white glazed brick, with Staffordshire blue bricks (now painted black) forming horizontal bands, the plinth, and surrounds for door and window openings, and dressings in Portland stone. It was originally a wallpaper printing works, now used as office space. It is a Grade II* listed building. It faces the main factory building and was once joined to it by a bridge across the road. It was Voysey&#x27;s only industrial building, and is considered an &quot;important Arts and Crafts factory building&quot;.

In 1971, Erin Pizzey established the world&#x27;s first domestic violence refuge at 2 Belmont Terrace, naming her organisation &quot;Chiswick Women&#x27;s Aid&quot;. The local council attempted to evict Pizzey&#x27;s residents, but were unsuccessful and she soon established more such premises elsewhere, inspiring the creation of refuges worldwide.

Chiswick is home to the Arts Educational Schools in Bath Road.

The house used for filming the comedy show &quot;Taskmaster&quot;, a former groundskeeper&#x27;s cottage, is just off Great Chertsey Road, near Chiswick Bridge.

== Transport ==

Chiswick is situated at the start of the North Circular Road (A406), South Circular Road (A205) and the M4 motorway, the latter providing a direct connection to Heathrow Airport and the M25 motorway. The Great West Road (A4) runs eastwards into central London via the Hogarth Roundabout where it meets the Great Chertsey Road (A316) which runs south-west, eventually joining the M3 motorway.

The southern border of Chiswick runs along the River Thames, which is crossed in this area by Barnes Railway and Foot Bridge, Chiswick Bridge, Kew Railway Bridge and Kew Bridge. River services between Westminster Pier and Hampton Court depart from Kew Gardens Pier just across Kew Bridge.

The finishing post is just downstream of Chiswick Bridge. Other important races such as the Head of the River Race race the reverse course, on an ebb tide. Chiswick is home to several clubs. The University of London Boat Club is based in its boathouse off Hartington Road, which also houses the clubs of many London colleges and teaching hospitals; recent members include Tim Foster, Gold medallist at the Sydney Olympics and Frances Houghton, World Champion in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

<text>Clapham () is a district in south west London, England, lying mostly within the London Borough of Lambeth, but with some areas (including Clapham Common) extending into the neighbouring London Borough of Wandsworth.

==History==

===Early history===
The present day Clapham High Street is on the route of a Roman road. The road is recorded on a Roman monumental stone found nearby. According to its inscription, the stone was erected by a man named Vitus Ticinius Ascanius. It is estimated to date from the 1st century AD. (The stone was discovered during building works at Clapham Common South Side in 1912. It is now placed by the entrance of the former Clapham Library, in the Old Town.)

According to the history of the Clapham family, maintained by the College of Heralds, in 965 King Edgar of England gave a grant of land at Clapham to Jonas, son of the Duke of Lorraine, and Jonas was thenceforth known as Jonas &quot;de [of] Clapham&quot;. The family remained in possession of the land until Jonas&#x27;s great-great grandson Arthur sided against William the Conqueror during the Norman Conquest of 1066 and, losing the land, fled to the north (where the Clapham family remained thereafter, primarily in Yorkshire).

Clapham&#x27;s name derives from Old English, meaning &#x27;homestead or enclosure near a hill&#x27;, with the first recorded usage being &quot;Cloppaham&quot; circa 880.

Clapham appears in Domesday Book as &quot;Clopeham&quot;. It was held by Goisfrid (Geoffrey) de Mandeville, and its domesday assets were three hides, six ploughs, and of meadow. It rendered £7 10s 0d, and was located in Brixton hundred.

The parish comprised . The benefice remains to this day a rectory, and in the 19th century was in the patronage of the Atkins family: the tithes were commuted for £488 14s. in the early 19th century, and so the remaining glebe comprised only as of 1848. The church, on the site of the current St Paul&#x27;s and belonging to Merton Priory was, with the exception of the north aisle which was left standing for the performance of burials, taken down under an act of parliament in 1774. A new church, Holy Trinity, was erected in the following year at an expense of £11,000 (), on the north side of the common.

===Clapham in the 17th–19th centuries===
In the late 17th century, large country houses began to be built there, and throughout the 18th and early 19th century it was favoured by the wealthier merchant classes of the City of London, who built many large and gracious houses and villas around Clapham Common and in the Old Town. Samuel Pepys spent the last two years of his life in Clapham, living with his friend, protected at the Admiralty and former servant William Hewer, until his death in 1703.

Clapham was also home to Elizabeth Cook, the widow of Captain James Cook the explorer. She lived in a house at 136 Clapham High Street for many years following the death of her husband.

Other notable residents of Clapham Common include Palace of Westminster architect Sir Charles Barry, Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg and 20th century novelist Graham Greene. John Francis Bentley, architect of Westminster Cathedral, lived in the adjacent Old Town.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the Clapham Sect were a group of wealthy City merchants (mostly evangelical Anglican) social reformers who lived around the Common. They included William Wilberforce, Henry Thornton and Zachary Macaulay, father of the historian Thomas Macaulay, as well as William Smith Member of Parliament (MP), the Dissenter and Unitarian. They were very prominent in campaigns for the abolition of slavery and child labour, and for prison reform. They also promoted missionary activities in Britain&#x27;s colonies. The Society for Missions to Africa and the East (as the Church Mission Society was first called) was founded on 12 April 1799 at a meeting of the Eclectic Society, supported by members of the Clapham Sect, who met under the guidance of John Venn, the Rector of Clapham. By contrast, an opponent of Wilberforce, merchant and slave-trader George Hibbert also lived at Clapham Common, worshipping in the same church, Holy Trinity.

In 1848, Clapham was described in the &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot; as a village which &quot;has for many years, been one of the most respectable in the environs of the metropolis&quot;. At this time, the patronage of Holy Trinity church belonged to the Atkins family.

===Clapham in the 20th and 21st centuries===
After the coming of the railways, Clapham developed as a suburb for commuters into central London. Clapham High Street railway station opened in 1862 and the underground City and South London Railway was extended to the area in 1900. By 1900 Clapham had fallen from favour with the upper classes. Many of their grand houses had been demolished by the middle of the 20th century, though a number remain around the Common and in the Old Town, as do a substantial number of fine late 18th- and early 19th-century houses. Today&#x27;s Clapham is an area of varied housing, from the large Queen Anne-, Regency- and Georgian-era homes of the Old Town and Clapham Common, to the grids of Victorian housing in the Abbeville area. As in much of London, the area also includes social housing on estates dating from the 1930s and 1960s.

In the early 20th century, Clapham was seen as an ordinary commuter suburb, often cited as representing ordinary people: hence the familiar &quot;man on the Clapham omnibus&quot;. By the 1980s, the area had undergone a further transformation, becoming the centre for the gentrification of most of the surrounding area. Clapham&#x27;s relative proximity to traditionally expensive areas of central London led to an increase in the number of middle-class people living in Clapham. Today the area is generally an affluent place, although many of its professional residents live relatively close to significant pockets of social housing.

===Local government===

Clapham was an ancient parish in the county of Surrey. For poor law purposes the parish became part of the Wandsworth and Clapham Union in 1836. The parish was added to the Registrar General London Metropolis area in 1844 and consequently it came within the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855. The population of 16,290 in 1851 was considered too small for the Clapham vestry to be a viable sanitary authority and the parish was grouped into the Wandsworth District, electing 18 members to the Wandsworth District Board of Works. In 1889 the parish was transferred to the County of London and in 1900 it became part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth. It was abolished as a civil parish in 1904, becoming part of the single Wandsworth Borough parish for poor law. The former Metropolitan Borough of Wandsworth was divided in 1965 and the area of the historic parish of Clapham was transferred to the London Borough of Lambeth, along with Streatham. Clapham gave its name to a Parliamentary constituency between 1885 and 1974. Between 1974 and 2024 Clapham was divided between the constituencies of Streatham and Vauxhall. From the 2024 General Election Clapham&#x27;s wards are reunited in the new constituency of Clapham &amp; Brixton.

==Geography==
Translated to the postal system, Clapham fills most of SW4 and as defined, at least since the Norman Conquest until 1885, includes parts of SW8, SW9 and SW12, London. Clapham Common is shared with the London Borough of Wandsworth (the border between the two boroughs runs across the common), but Lambeth has responsibility for its management. According to the 2011 census, the Clapham Area has a population of 40,850. For administrative and electoral purposes, Clapham is made up of three Lambeth wards: Clapham Common and Abbeville, Clapham Town and Clapham East. Parts of the Clapham East ward like in neighbouring Stockwell

Much of southern Battersea is often incorrectly referred to as Clapham, because of the name of Clapham Junction railway station, and to stress Battersea&#x27;s proximity to Clapham Common, as well as their relative distance from Battersea&#x27;s historic nucleus. The railway station now known as Clapham Junction was originally named Battersea Junction by its architect to reflect its geographical location.

==Demography==
According to the 2021 census, Clapham has a population of 48,478. White is the largest ethnic group, at 64% of the population, followed by 19% Black. Clapham is home to one of the largest Australian communities in London.

==Clapham Common==

Clapham Common comprises 220 acres of green space, criss-crossed by footpaths, with three ponds, a Victorian bandstand and a large number of mature trees, including horse chestnuts and a significant avenue of London plane trees along Long Road. It is overlooked by a variety of buildings, including a number of Georgian and Victorian mansions. It also has Holy Trinity Clapham, an 18th-century Georgian church, important in the history of the evangelical Clapham Sect. Clapham Town comprises Clapham High Street and residential streets including Clapham Manor Street, home to Clapham Leisure Centre, as well as Venn Street with a cinema, restaurants, and a food market held every weekend throughout the year.

==Clapham South==
The neighbourhood, where used, derives its name from a tube station—it has no fixed boundary from the rest of Clapham. Taking any definition in informal use, it is predominantly mid-rise and low-rise residential land, and usually takes in major parts of the Common. Where regard to historic Clapham parish and some street signs is had, this area includes a detached part: the land bounded by Nightingale Square, Oldridge Road and Balham Hill.

==Clapham North==
Clapham North lies on either side of Clapham Road and borders the relatively modern creation &#x27;Stockwell&#x27; in the historic Lambeth parish on Union Road and Stirling Road. There is a &quot;Stockwell Town&quot; Partnership sign north of Union Road demarcating the boundary between Clapham and Stockwell. The northern part of Clapham in the Larkhall ward includes the Sibella conservation area. The southern part is Ferndale ward and includes Landor, Ferndale and Bedford roads leading up to Brixton.

==Transport==
As well as an extensive bus network, which connects the area with much of south and central London, Clapham has three tube stations and two railway stations.

There are two railway stations in the district on London Overground&#x27;s Windrush line:
* Clapham High Street
* Wandsworth Road, then at the following station, Clapham Junction: London Overground&#x27;s Mildmay line

London Underground&#x27;s Northern line passes through Clapham, with three stations:
* Clapham North (opened as Clapham Road in 1900, changed to its current name in 1926).
* Clapham Common
* Clapham South

In 2012, the Overground East London line was extended to Clapham High Street and Wandsworth Road stations. This links Clapham directly to stations including Shepherds Bush, Canada Water, Shoreditch and Highbury and Islington.

Clapham Junction is one of the major rail transport hubs and network of railway junctions in England. There are frequent services to London Victoria and London Waterloo.

==Shopping==
Shopping areas comprise:

* Clapham Old Town, which includes pubs and restaurants.
* Clapham High Street
* Abbeville Road (and Clapham South)
* Nightingale Lane (on borders of Clapham South)
* Clapham Road, includes diverse amount of different shops

==Sport==

<text>Clerkenwell ( ) is an area of central London, England.

Clerkenwell was an ancient parish from the medieval period onwards, and now forms the south-western part of the London Borough of Islington. The church of St James in Clerkenwell Close and nearby Clerkenwell Green sit at the centre of Clerkenwell. 
Located on the edge of the City of London, it was the home of the Priory of St John and the site of a number of wells and spas, including Sadlers Wells and Spa Green. The well after which the area was named was rediscovered in 1924. 

The Marquess of Northampton owned much of the land in Clerkenwell, reflected in placenames such as Northampton Square, Spencer Street and Compton Street.

The watchmaking and watch repairing trades were once of great importance, particularly in the area around Northampton Square. In the 20th century, Clerkenwell became known as a centre for architecture and design.

Clerkenwell is home to City University and the Royal Mail&#x27;s Mount Pleasant sorting office. It includes the neighbourhoods of Farringdon and Exmouth Market.

==Geography==
Goswell Street formed the eastern boundary of the Clerkenwell parishes, with the River Fleet, now buried beneath Farringdon Road and other streets, forming the western boundary with Holborn and, in part, St Pancras. This western boundary with both neighbouring areas is now used as part of the London Borough of Islington&#x27;s western boundary with the London Borough of Camden.

Pentonville is a part of northern Clerkenwell, while the southern part is sometimes referred to as Farringdon, after the railway station of that name – which was named after Farringdon Road (an extension of Farringdon Street) and originally named Farringdon Street Station.

Finsbury Town Hall and the Finsbury Estate lie in Clerkenwell, rather than Finsbury. They are named after the former Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury which included Clerkenwell, Finsbury and other areas.

==History==

&quot;For a list of street name etymologies in the Clerkenwell area see Street names of Clerkenwell and Finsbury.&quot;

===Clerks&#x27; Well===
Clerkenwell took its name from the Clerks&#x27; Well in Farringdon Lane (&quot;clerken&quot; was the Middle English genitive plural of &quot;clerk&quot;, a variant of &quot;&quot;, meaning literate person or clergyman). The first surviving reference to the name is from 1100. In the Middle Ages, the London Parish clerks performed annual mystery plays there, based on biblical themes. Part of the well remains visible, incorporated into a 1980s building called Well Court. It is visible through a window of that building on Farringdon Lane. Access to the well is managed by Islington Local History Centre and visits can be arranged by appointment.

===Monastic traditions===
The Monastic Order of the Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem had its English headquarters at the Priory of Clerkenwell. (The Blessed Gerard founded the Order to provide medical assistance during the crusades.) St John&#x27;s Gate (built by Sir Thomas Docwra in 1504) survives in the rebuilt form of the Priory Gate. Its gateway, erected in 1504 in St John&#x27;s Square, served various purposes after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. For example, it was the birthplace of the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1731, and the scene of Dr Johnson&#x27;s work in connection with that journal. In modern times the gatehouse again became associated with the order and was in the early 20th century the headquarters of the St John Ambulance Association. An Early English crypt remains beneath the chapel of the order, which was otherwise mostly rebuilt in the 1950s after wartime bombing. The notorious deception of the &quot;Cock Lane Ghost&quot;, in which Johnson took great interest, was perpetrated nearby.

Adjoining the priory was St Mary&#x27;s nunnery of the Benedictine order, now entirely disappeared, and St James&#x27;s Church, rebuilt in 1792 on the site of the original church which was partly of Norman provenance. The Charterhouse, near the boundary with the City of London, was originally a Carthusian monastery. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Charterhouse became a private mansion and one owner, Thomas Sutton, subsequently left it with an endowment as a school and almshouse. The almshouse remains but the school relocated to Surrey and its part of the site is now a campus of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry.

===Black Mary&#x27;s Hole===
Black Mary’s Hole was a locality and small rural settlement in a low-lying area on the eastern, Clerkenwell side of the valley of the River Fleet. The area included fields called &quot;Black Mary’s Hole&quot;, and &quot;Robin Hood’s Field&quot;, which together with the name of the former local pub, &quot;The Fox at Bay&quot;, seem to reflect the lawlessness of the area. The locality was also known as a meeting place for gay men.


===New River Head===
The construction of the New River between 1604 and 1613 resulted in the creation of the New River Head in Clerkenwell, on what is now Rosebery Avenue. The New River was constructed to supply London with fresh drinking water from Hertfordshire, and the New River Head originally consisted of a circular reservoir, the &quot;Round Pond&quot; and an associated building, the &quot;Water House&quot;. From here water was fed into a network of wooden mains which conveyed water to the cisterns of London.

Over the years the New River Head complex expanded with the addition of further reservoirs and pumping stations, driven by windmill, horse gin and, eventually, steam engine. In 1820, the New River Company, owners of the river, moved its offices into an enlarged Water House, beginning an association of the site with the administration of London&#x27;s water supply that was to last some 170 years. In 1920, the Metropolitan Water Board opened a new office building at New River Head, and this remained the headquarters for London&#x27;s water supply up to the privatisation of the Thames Water Authority in 1989. The site is now largely in residential use, including both converted buildings and newly built apartment blocks.

===New River Estate===
From 1810 to 1850, the New River Company developed housing on the land surrounding New River Head. At the centre is Myddelton Square, named after Sir Hugh Myddelton, developer of the New River, with the Grade II listed St Mark&#x27;s Church in the centre. The church was built in 1827 in Victorian Gothic style by William Chadwell Mylne, after whom the nearby Mylne Street and Chadwell Street are named. The estate is a series of streets and terraces in neo-Classical, Greek revival style. The place names reference the New River company, including Amwell Street (after the New River&#x27;s source in Hertfordshire) and River Street.

===Lloyd Baker Estate===
The Lloyd Baker estate was laid out immediately to the west of the New River estate from 1820 to 1840. It takes its name from the family of Bishop William Lloyd who inherited the land from his godmother Flower Backhouse, Countess of Clarendon, a shareholder in the New River company. The estate is characterised by neo-classical pedimented villas and garden squares.

===Notoriety===
As it was a suburb beyond the confines of the London Wall, Clerkenwell was outside the jurisdiction of the somewhat puritanical City fathers. Consequently, &quot;base tenements and houses of unlawful and disorderly resort&quot; sprang up, with a &quot;great number of dissolute, loose, and insolent people harboured in such and the like noisome and disorderly houses, as namely poor cottages, and habitations of beggars and people without trade, stables, inns, alehouses, taverns, garden-houses converted to dwellings, ordinaries, dicing houses, bowling alleys, and brothel houses&quot;.

During the Elizabethan era Clerkenwell contained a notorious brothel quarter. In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry IV, Part 2&quot;, Falstaff complains about Justice Shallow boasting of &quot;the wildness of his youth, and the feats he has done about Turnbull Street&quot;. Known now as Turnmill Street and adjoining Farringdon station, it had an infamous reputation for brothel-keeping and was described in Sugden&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary&quot; as &quot;the most disreputable street in London, a haunt of thieves and loose women&quot;. The Clerkenwell Bridewell, a prison and correctional institute for prostitutes and vagrants, was known for savage punishment and endemic sexual corruption.

===Prisons===

Clerkenwell was also the location of three prisons: the Clerkenwell Bridewell, Coldbath Fields Prison (later Clerkenwell Gaol) and the New Prison, later the Clerkenwell House of Detention, notorious as the scene of the Clerkenwell Outrage in 1867, an attempted prison break by Fenians who killed many in the tenement houses on Corporation Row in trying to blow a hole in the prison wall. The House of Detention was demolished in 1890 but the extensive vaults and cells beneath, now known as the Clerkenwell Catacombs, remained. They were reopened as air raid shelters during the Blitz, and for a few years were open as a minor tourist attraction. Various film scenes have been shot in the catacombs.

===Industrial Revolution===
The Industrial Revolution changed the area greatly. It became a centre for breweries, distilleries and the printing industry. It gained an especial reputation for the making of clocks, marine chronometers and watches, which activity once employed many people from around the area. Flourishing craft workshops still carry on some of the traditional trades, such as jewellery-making. Clerkenwell was home to Witherbys, a printing company who have now split ownership, with the printers having relocated to north London and the publishers to Scotland (see also the Witherby Publishing Group).

It was during the Industrial Revolution that Clerkenwell became known as London&#x27;s Italian district, although the total number of Italian residents probably numbered no more than 2,000 at any one time.
The Kodak United Company opened a factory and storefront at 41–43 Clerkenwell and took advantage of the surplus of unemployed Jewelers and Watch makers to build their Stereoscopic and Folding Pocket Cameras that they produced and repaired. The location also allowed them easy access to the chemicals required for their Bromide based papers and negatives. During World War II, they were relocated for security reasons because of the fear that Axis bombs would destroy the photographic equipment used for the war effort.

===Clerkenwell Green===

Clerkenwell Green lies at the centre of the old village, by the church, and has a mixture of housing, offices and pubs, dominated by the imposing former Middlesex Sessions House. It was built in 1782, extended during the Victorian era, and by the early 21st century used as a Masonic hall. The name is something of a historical relic – Clerkenwell Green has had no grass for over 300 years. However, in conveying some impression of its history, it gives the appearance of one of the better-preserved village centres in what is now central London. In Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Clerkenwell Green is where Fagin and the Artful Dodger induct Oliver into pickpocketing amongst shoppers in the busy market once held there. In his words it is &quot;an open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some perversion of terms the Green&quot;, despite lacking any &quot;greenery&quot;. Indeed, Dickens knew the area well and was a customer of the Finsbury Savings Bank on Sekforde Street, which links Clerkenwell Green to St John Street. 

Hockley-in-the-Hole was an area of Clerkenwell Green where bull-baiting, bear-baiting and similar activities occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries.

===Radicalism===
Clerkenwell Green has historically been associated with radicalism, from the Lollards in the 16th century, the Chartists in the 19th century and communists in the early 20th century. In 1902, Vladimir Lenin moved the publication of the &quot;Iskra&quot; (Spark) to the British Social Democratic Federation at 37a Clerkenwell Green, and issues 22 to 38 were indeed edited there. At that time Vladimir Lenin resided on Percy Circus, less than half a mile north of Clerkenwell Green. In 1903, the newspaper was moved to Geneva. It is said that Lenin and a young Joseph Stalin met in the Crown and Anchor pub (now The Crown Tavern) when the latter was visiting London in 1903. In the 1920s and 1930s, 37a Clerkenwell Green was a venue for Communist Party meetings, and the Marx Memorial Library was founded on the same site in 1933. In 1942 the local borough council erected a controversial bust of Vladimir Lenin at the site of a new block of flats in Holford Square (the bust was removed in the 1950s).

Clerkenwell&#x27;s tradition of left-leaning publication continued until late 2008 with &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Observer&quot; having their headquarters on Farringdon Road, a short walk from the Green. Their new offices are a short distance away in King&#x27;s Cross. In 2011, an anti-cuts protest march departed from Clerkenwell and ended with a rally at Trafalgar Square demanding trade union rights, human rights and international solidarity.

===Local government===

Clerkenwell St James was an ancient parish in the Finsbury division of the Ossulstone hundred of Middlesex. Part of the parish of St James was split off as the parish of St John in 1723. However, for civil matters they remained a single parish. The Clerkenwell Vestry became a nominating authority to the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1855.

Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the parish of St James &amp; St John Clerkenwell was divided into five wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 (12), No. 2 (15), No. 3 (12), No. 4 (18) and No. 5 (15).

The area of the metropolitan board became the County of London in 1889. A reform of local government in 1900 abolished the Clerkenwell Vestry and the parish became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury. Alexandra Park, an exclave of the parish, was transferred to Hornsey, Middlesex at the same time. Clerkenwell Town Hall, which had been built on Rosebery Avenue in 1895, became Finsbury Town Hall. Finsbury became part of the London Borough of Islington in 1965 and the old town hall lay empty and deteriorating for many years. It has since been sold to the Urdang Dance Academy.

===Post-war de-industrialisation and revival===
After the Second World War Clerkenwell suffered from industrial decline and many of the premises occupied by the engineering, printing publishing and meat and food trades (the last mostly around Smithfield) fell empty. Several acclaimed council housing estates were commissioned by Finsbury Borough Council. Modernist architect and Russian émigré Berthold Lubetkin&#x27;s listed Spa Green Estate, constructed 1943–1950, has recently been restored. The Finsbury Estate, constructed in 1968 to the designs of Joseph Emberton includes flats, since altered and re-clad.

A general revival and gentrification process began in the 1980s, and the area is now known for loft-living in some of the former industrial buildings. It also has young professionals, nightclubs and restaurants and is home to many professional offices as an overspill for the nearby City of London and West End. Amongst other sectors, there is a notable concentration of design professions around Clerkenwell, and supporting industries such as high-end designer furniture showrooms. It is claimed that the area has the highest concentration of architects and building professionals in the world. Many of London&#x27;s leading architectural practices have offices in the area.

==Entertainment==

===Historic public houses===
It is said that Vladimir Lenin and a young Joseph Stalin first met in the Crown and Anchor pub (now known as the Crown Tavern) on Clerkenwell Green, when the latter was visiting London in 1903.

&quot;The Betsey Trotwood&quot; (named after Betsey Trotwood in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by Charles Dickens) adopted the name in 1983, having previously been the &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Arms&quot;.

===Restaurants===
In 2005 Mark Bittman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Clerkenwell has &quot;some of the best restaurants in London&quot;. Restaurants in Clerkenwell include St John and the Michelin-starred Club Gascon.

==London&#x27;s Little Italy==

In the 1850s the south-western part of Clerkenwell and Saffron Hill in the nearby borough of Holborn became known as London&#x27;s &quot;Little Italy&quot; because around 2,000 Italians had settled in the area. The community had mostly dispersed by the 1960s, but the area remains the &#x27;spiritual home&#x27; of London&#x27;s Italians, and is a focal point for more recent Italian immigrants, largely because of St Peter&#x27;s Italian Church in nearby Saffron Hill. There are officially over 200,000 Italians in London, and possibly many more. The Italian Procession of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and Sagra takes place each July in the streets surrounding the church.

A small number of Italian businesses remain from the nineteenth century including organ builders Chiappa Ltd, and food outlets such as the deli Terroni of Clerkenwell and Gazzano&#x27;s. Many other Italian firms survive from the period but have relocated elsewhere.

==Transport==

=== Rail ===
Farringdon station is the only station in Clerkenwell itself. 12.618 million journeys began or ended at Farringdon in 2017–18. The station first opened in 1863 as &quot;Farringdon Street&quot;.

==== London Underground ====
Farringdon is served by the London Underground Circle, Hammersmith and City and Metropolitan lines and the Elizabeth line. The next station west of Farringdon is King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras, and all westbound trains call at Baker Street tube station. To the east, the next stations are Barbican, Moorgate and Liverpool Street in the City.

The Hammersmith and City and Circle lines both terminate in West London at Hammersmith (via Paddington). Eastbound, the Hammersmith and City line continues towards Barking in East London, whilst the Circle line loops around the City of London with trains heading westwards towards Tower Hill, Embankment and Victoria. The Metropolitan line terminates at Aldgate to the east, and to the west, trains carry passengers to Wembley Park, Uxbridge, and stations in Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

There are several tube stations near the fringes of Clerkenwell:

*Angel (&quot;Northern line&quot;)
*Barbican (&quot;Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines&quot;)
*Chancery Lane (&quot;Central line&quot;)
*Moorgate (&quot;Circle, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and Northern lines&quot;)

==== National Rail ====
Farringdon is a National Rail station served on the Thameslink route, served by Thameslink trains run by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR). This links Clerkenwell directly to Luton and Gatwick airports, and destinations including Bedford, Brighton, Cambridge, Luton, Peterborough, and destinations in South London and Kent. Moorgate is also nearby, with Great Northern services linking the area directly to North London and Hertfordshire destinations.

=== Road ===
Clerkenwell is in the London Congestion Charge Zone, as well as the London Low Emission and Ultra Low Emission Zones. Most roads in Clerkenwell are residential, but several key routes cross Clerkenwell.

Goswell Road carries the A1 between the City of London (Barbican) and Angel, with the road continuing northbound towards Highbury, Archway and the M1. Beyond London, the A1 passes through the East and North of England before terminating in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Farringdon Street is numbered the A201, which links Clerkenwell to King&#x27;s Cross, Blackfriars, and Elephant &amp; Castle. The A5201 (Clerkenwell Road/Old Street) also runs through Clerkenwell, linking Soho and Holborn in Central London with Shoreditch and the A10 to Clerkenwell&#x27;s east.

=== Cycling ===
Transport for London (TfL) and the London Borough of Islington both provide cycling infrastructure in Clerkenwell, and the area is well connected to London&#x27;s cycle network.

Cycle Superhighway 6 (CS6) runs north–south through Clerkenwell, which provides the area with direct links to King&#x27;s Cross, Bloomsbury, Blackfriars and Elephant and Castle on a signed cycle route. To the south of Farringdon station, CS6 uses a segregated cycle track which runs parallel to Farringdon Road. South of Exmouth Market, signal-controlled junctions on Farringdon Road often give priority to cyclists, particularly where there is a cycle lane or track to separate cycles from other road traffic. In the north of Clerkenwell, CS6 runs on quieter &quot;side-streets&quot; towards Bloomsbury and King&#x27;s Cross.

Quietways 2 and 10 are also nearby, both passing through Finsbury. Quietway 2 links Russell Square to Angel, Dalston and Walthamstow via Finsbury, whilst Quietway 10 runs from Finsbury to Finsbury Park. Quietways use cycle paths and &quot;side-streets&quot; allowing cyclists to avoid busy roads. Quietways 2 and 10 are signed cycle routes.

Bus and cycle lanes are also provided on Rosebery Avenue, Clerkenwell Road and Percival Street.

Santander Cycles, a cycle hire scheme across Central London, has docking stations with bicycles for hire across Clerkenwell.

<doc id="93937" wikidata="Q205679" url="?curid=93937" title="London Borough of Hackney">
<text>The London Borough of Hackney ( ) is a London borough in Inner London, England. The historical and administrative heart of Hackney is Mare Street, which lies north-east of Charing Cross. The borough is named after Hackney, its principal district. Southern and eastern parts of the borough are popularly regarded as being part of east London that spans some of the traditional East End of London with the northwest belonging to north London. Its population is estimated to be 281,120.

The London Plan issued by the Greater London Authority assigns whole boroughs to sub-regions for statutory monitoring, engagement and resource allocation purposes. The most recent (2011) iteration of this plan assigns Hackney to the &#x27;East&#x27; sub-region, while the 2008 and 2004 versions assigned the borough to &quot;North&quot; and &quot;East&quot; sub-regions respectively. The modern borough was formed in 1965 by the merger of the Metropolitan Borough of Hackney with the much smaller Metropolitan Boroughs of Stoke Newington and Shoreditch.

Hackney is bounded by Islington to the west, Haringey to the north, Waltham Forest to the north-east, Newham to the east, Tower Hamlets to the south-east and the City of London to the south-west. Hackney was one of the host boroughs of the London Olympics in 2012, with several of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park venues falling within its boundaries.

==History==
===Place name origin===
In the 13th century the name appears as &quot;Hackenaye&quot; or &quot;Hacquenye&quot;, but no certain derivation is advanced. The &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of Place Names&quot; (fourth edition) discusses the origin of the name. The first surviving records of the place name are as Hakney (1231) and Hakeneye (1242 and 1294). The &quot;ey&quot; suffix almost certainly refers to an island; the dictionary favours the interpretation that Hackney means &quot;Haka&#x27;s island&quot;, with Haka being a notable local person and the island (or inaccessible place surrounded by marshes) lying close to the River Lea. This was once a much wilder place than today.

The dictionary suggests that the &quot;Hack&quot; element may also derive from:
* The Old English &quot;Haecc&quot;, meaning a hatch – an entrance to a woodland or common.
* Or alternatively from &quot;Haca&quot;, meaning a hook, and in this context, a bend of the river.
Given the island context, the &quot;hatch&quot; option is unlikely to be correct, so the favoured &quot;Haka&#x27;s Island&quot; or the &quot;Island on the bend&quot; seem more likely.

The place name will have originally referred to just the island or possibly both the island and the manor of the same name based around it. Subsequently, the name Hackney was applied to the whole ancient parish of Hackney.

===Iron Age to Anglo-Saxon period===
In the Iron Age and probably until after the Roman period (as the Romans used tribal territories as administrative sub-divisions), the River Lea was considered to separate the territories of the Catuvellauni to the west of the river from the Trinovantes to the east.

The Romans built the Roman road, Ermine Street, which runs through the modern borough under the names Shoreditch High Street and Kingsland Road, among others.

In the Anglo-Saxon period, the River Lea separated the core territories of the East Saxons (on the east side) from the Middle Saxons (on the western, Hackney side) they often controlled. This continuity of this natural boundary from pre-Roman period may be a result of the differing Saxon groups taking control of pre-defined territories.

After both areas were brought under the control of Alfred the Great, the river became the boundary between the historic counties of Middlesex (Hackney) and Essex (modern Newham, Waltham Forest and Redbridge).

===Later history===
In the Tudor period, the lands of religious orders were seized by the Crown and put up for sale. Thus Hackney became a retreat for the nobility around Hackney Central and Homerton. Henry VIII&#x27;s Palace was by Lea Bridge roundabout, where BSix Sixth Form College stands today. Sutton House, on Homerton High Street, is the oldest surviving dwelling in Hackney, originally built in 1535 as &quot;Bryck Place&quot; for Sir Ralph Sadleir, a diplomat. The village of Hackney flourished from the Tudor to late Georgian periods as a rural retreat.

The first documented &quot;hackney coach&quot;—the forerunner of the more generic &quot;hackney carriage&quot;—operated in London in 1621. Current opinion is that the name &quot;hackney&quot;, to refer to a London taxi, is derived from the village name. (Hackney, associated with high-stepping horses and horse-drawn carriages, is the root of the French word &quot;haquenée&quot;, a term used for a small breed of horse, and the Sardinian horse.) Construction of the railway in the 1850s ended Hackney&#x27;s rural reputation by connecting it to other parts of the city and stimulating development.
London&#x27;s first Tudor theatres were built at Shoreditch. The Gunpowder Plot was first exposed nearby in Hoxton.

In 1727 Daniel Defoe said of the villages of Hackney 

The parish church of St John-at-Hackney was built in 1792, replacing the nearby former 16th-century parish church dedicated to St Augustine (pulled down in 1798).

Notable residents from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries included Robert Aske, William Cecil, Samuel Courtauld, Samuel Hoare, Joseph Priestley and Thomas Sutton.

Many grand houses stood in Stoke Newington and Stamford Hill; the latter neighbourhood became a center of Hackney&#x27;s many Orthodox Jewish residents from the 1930s. Alfred Hitchcock made many of his first films in Hoxton at the Gainsborough Studios in Poole Street.

The interwar era saw the building of social housing by the LCC and the borough council in the area including the Kingsmead Estate, Morningside Estate, Banister House and Nisbet House. The borough also includes housing projects developed by high-profile postwar architects including The Beckers (1958) by Sir Frederick Gibberd, Granard House (1959) by Colin St John Wilson and Pitcairn House (1962) by Eric Lyons. Following extensive post-war development and immigration since the late 20th century, population pressure has increased and the area&#x27;s many Georgian and Victorian terraces are being gentrified, warehouses are being converted to housing, and new flats are being built.

In the 1980s and beyond, Hackney was described as the poorest borough in Britain - although it has been questioned whether this may have in fact been Glasgow, at the time. The council used the phrase &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Poorest Borough&#x27; in official materials. It was described in this way as late as 2001 and in Parliament in 2010. This picture has now changed: the 2019 Indices of Multiple Deprivation found that Hackney was the 22nd most deprived borough in England, down from 11th in 2015 and 2nd in 2010, whilst Hackney has also featured prominently in discussions of gentrification.

It was ranked as inner London&#x27;s &quot;greenest borough&quot; and London Transport&#x27;s &quot;best bike borough 2006&quot;, with 62 parks and open spaces, covering . Seven Hackney parks have now achieved Green Flag status. One, Abney Park, became scheduled in 2009 as one of Britain&#x27;s historic parks and garden at risk from neglect and decay. Hackney Marshes play host to the largest collection of football pitches in Europe. Part of it was used as a site for events of the 2012 Summer Olympics.

In 2021, the addition of 3 illegal art pieces,the anarchist charity Antepavillion was given an ordinance to remove their most recent illegal art piece &quot;Sharks!&quot; This brought the Metropolitan Police to raid Antepavillion&#x27;s main warehouse and illegal Potemkin Theatre to stop the addition of the piece. After its placement was banned in the protected canal area, the Islington Boat Club put it on display in their private area.

===Listed buildings and conservation areas===
There are 1,300 listed buildings in Hackney, including the Hackney Empire, Tudor Sutton House, and the Grade I medieval St Augustine&#x27;s Tower, the borough&#x27;s oldest building. The borough contains 25 conservation areas including Clapton Square and urban open-spaces including Clapton Common and Clissold Park. Conservation areas also protect large areas of Georgian and Victorian housing, and areas of industrial heritage.

===Administrative history===
The area of the modern borough broadly corresponds to the three ancient parishes of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington, which had all historically been part of the Ossulstone hundred of the county of Middlesex. For some administrative functions, Ossulstone was divided into four divisions. Stoke Newington was part of the Finsbury division. Hackney and Shoreditch were both part of the Tower division, which was noteworthy in that the men of the area owed military service to the Tower of London.
The ancient parishes provided a framework for both civil (administrative) and ecclesiastical (church) functions, but during the 19th century there was a divergence into distinct civil and ecclesiastical parish systems. The ecclesiastical parishes were gradually sub-divided to better serve the needs of a growing population, while the civil parishes continued to be based on the same ancient parish areas.

From 1856 the area was governed by the Metropolitan Board of Works, which was established to provide services across the metropolis of London. In 1889 the Metropolitan Board of Works&#x27; area was made the County of London. From 1856 until 1900 the lower tier of local government within the metropolis comprised various parish vestries and district boards. Shoreditch was governed by its vestry, whilst Hackney and Stoke Newington were initially grouped into the Hackney District with a single board covering the two parishes. This proved unpopular, especially in more affluent Stoke Newington. After four unsuccessful attempts, the Hackney District was dissolved in 1894 under the Metropolis Management (Plumstead and Hackney) Act 1893, and its two parishes were then each governed separately by their own vestries.

In 1900 the lower tier was reorganised into metropolitan boroughs. In this area the three parishes each became a borough: Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington. There were some rationalisations to boundaries, notably that Shoreditch absorbed part of the tiny Liberty of Norton Folgate (with the rest going to neighbouring Stepney).

Stoke Newington was smaller than the desired size for the new boroughs, and there were proposals to re-merge Stoke Newington and Hackney, or to detach the northern part of Hackney and join it with Stoke Newington. These proposals were rejected due to the experience of &quot;intolerable and interminable feuds&quot; between the districts when they were previously &quot;forced together&quot;. The First Lord of the Treasury, Arthur Balfour recognised that there was &quot;great ill-feeling and mutual ill-will... between the inhabitants of the two districts&quot;. It was therefore decided to merge the South Hornsey exclaves of Hornsey, with a population about 20,000, with Stoke Newington. While this still created a borough of only about 50,000 inhabitants, and thus &quot;the smallest borough in London, the anomaly would be a gradually diminishing one, because the population in this district was rapidly increasing. When dividing London up into boroughs they could not avoid creating some anomalies as to size.&quot;

The modern London Borough of Hackney was created in 1965 under the London Government Act 1963. It covered the combined area of the three metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington.

==Governance==
The local authority is Hackney Council, which meets at Hackney Town Hall and has its main offices in the adjoining Hackney Service Centre. Since 2002 the council has been led by the directly elected Mayor of Hackney. A speaker fulfils the civic and ceremonial duties previously undertaken by the (non-political) mayor prior to 2002.

===Greater London representation===
Since 2000, for elections to the London Assembly, the borough forms part of the North East constituency. The constituency returned Sem Moema AM as the directly elected Assembly Member in 2021.

===UK Parliament===
The borough comprises two parliamentary constituencies: Hackney North and Stoke Newington (represented by Diane Abbott MP) and Hackney South and Shoreditch (represented by Meg Hillier MP); both are Privy Counsellors and Labour Party Members of Parliament. Final recommendations for a change to the boundaries of these two constituencies were published by the Boundary Commission in July 2023.

==Geography==
===Neighbourhoods===

The borough was formed by the merger of the metropolitan boroughs of Hackney, Shoreditch and Stoke Newington, with the boundaries of these very closely based on the Ancient Parishes of the same name; these areas have been consistently defined for many centuries. Historically, the River Lea formed the boundary between the predecessor counties of Middlesex and Essex.
Within these parish areas are a large number of sub-districts, some of which have sub-districts of their own. These sub-districts are generally based on former hamlets that expanded and merged as the area urbanised. These sub-districts have never been administrative units so have never had any formal boundaries, however a degree of informal definition has developed.
The sub-districts typically take Metropolitan Borough\Ancient Parish boundaries where available, and can also have informal customary boundaries such as road and railways. Despite this, many areas have only a weakly or partially understood extent and it is not unusual for perceptions of place to overlap or change over time.

The area of the former parish and borough of Stoke Newington includes the Woodberry Down area, while the former parish and borough of Shoreditch includes Hoxton and Haggerston.

The former parish and borough of Hackney is much larger and includes Hackney Central, Hackney Downs, West Hackney, Dalston, De Beauvoir Town, Shacklewell, Stamford Hill, London Fields, Upper and Lower Clapton, Hackney Wick and Homerton.

===Topography and Landscape history===
The London Borough of Hackney covers an area of , rising westward from the Lea to reach above sea level at Clapton Common and Stamford Hill. The area around Victoria Park, in the south of the borough lies about above sea level.

After the Norman Conquest the area became part of the Forest of Middlesex, which covered much of the county, but this gives rise to misunderstanding, as in this context &quot;Forest&quot; is a legal term referring to royal hunting rights and had a weak correlation with woodland cover, especially in the early post-Conquest Period.

By the time of the earliest reliable maps, in the 18th century, the area covered by the modern borough was an agricultural area characterised by enclosed farmland with small hamlets and very little woodland. There were a number of commons, most of which survived to become the basis of modern parks. Many of the major roads were present by this time, the road now known as the A10 was Roman, and others, like many in England, may be older.

With the obvious exception of the urbanisation of the area, the greatest changes have been to the waterways and wetlands of the area. The River Lea, the area&#x27;s primary geographic feature, has lost its grazing marshes and seen the River Lee Navigation created in 1770. This is an artificial channel of the river, passing through Hackney Cut and across the Hackney Marshes to straighten a meander of the natural river. In Roman times and for a long time after, the River Lea was an estuary, tidal as far as Hackney Wick.

At Hackney Wick the Hackney Brook met the Lea; the confluence was very wide when flooded. Hackney Brook was fully culverted in 1860 by the Metropolitan Board of Works.

The New River was opened in 1613, diverting water from the Lea catchment to create a source of drinking water for London. The New River still passes through the borough, close to Finsbury Park and flows towards Islington. Another man-made feature, the Regents Canal also crosses the borough to the south of De Beauvoir Town in the west, joining the Hertford Union Canal below Victoria Park.

===Housing and industry===
Much of Hackney retains an inner-city character, but in such places as Dalston large housing estates have been joined by newly developed gated communities. In South Hackney, near Victoria Park, terraced Georgian, Victorian and Edwardian housing still survives.

Light industries in the area around the River Lea employ over 3,000 people.

===Geology===
The Lea and Hackney Marshes are underlain by alluvium soils; and the higher ground between Homerton and Stamford Hill is formed on a widening bed of London Clay. Brickearth deposits are within tongues of clay extending beneath Clapton Common, Stamford Hill and Stoke Newington High Street. The centre and south-western districts lie on river terrace deposits of Taplow Gravel. Victoria Park and Well Street Common lie on flood plain gravel.

===Climate===
This data was taken between 1971 and 2000 at the nearest national weather station in Greenwich; around south of Hackney Town Hall:
== Demography ==
In 1801, the civil parishes that form the modern borough had a total population of 14,609. This rose steadily throughout the 19th century, as the district became built up; reaching 95,000 in the middle of that century. When the railways arrived the rate of population growth increased — reaching nearly 374,000 by the turn of the century. This increase in population peaked before World War I, falling slowly in the aftermath until World War II began an exodus from London towards the new towns under the Abercrombie Plan for London (1944). The population is now rising again, and the 2001 census gives Hackney a population of 202,824.

The population is ethnically diverse. Of the resident population, 89,490 (44%) people describe themselves as White British. 24,861 (12%) are in other White ethnic groups, 50,009 (24%) are Black or Black British, 19,791 (9%) are Asian or Asian British, 8,501 (4%) describe themselves as &#x27;Mixed&#x27;, and 6,432 (3%) as Chinese or Other.

There is also a large Turkish and Kurdish population resident in Hackney. Turkish and Kurdish communities are located in all parts of the borough, though there is a greater concentration in north and central Hackney.

132,931 (66%) of the resident population were British born. A further 10,095 (5%) were born in other parts of Europe, and the remaining 59,798 (29%) born elsewhere in the world.

2018 estimates are that Christianity is the biggest religion in Hackney, with 31% of residents identifying Christian; 13% identified as Muslim, 10% Jewish, and 7% belonged to other religions. A further 38% either have no religion, or did not submit a response. In numerical terms, Hackney has the second largest Jewish population of any local authority in the United Kingdom, after the London Borough of Barnet (and in percentage terms, third after Barnet and the Hertsmere borough of Hertfordshire).

32% of households are owner–occupied.

The largest rise of ethnic groups between 2001 and 2011 was &quot;Other&quot;, which increased by 222%. This was followed by &quot;Mixed&quot;, which rose by 84%.

According to the GLA Population Estimate for 2018, 36.4% of the borough&#x27;s population are White British, 18.1% are &quot;Other White&quot;, 10.3% are of Black African heritage, and 6.4% are of Black Caribbean heritage. Hackney is also home to several smaller Asian communities.

===Other statistics===
In a 2007 report, every ward of Hackney was among the 10% most deprived in the country, with 47% of children living in low-income households.

Hackney had a reputation as one of the most crime-ridden London boroughs, and some of its streets have even been referred to as &quot;Murder Mile&quot;, but cooperation between local police and council has resulted in the borough experiencing a bigger drop in crime than in any other London borough in the four-year period up to 2007 (28% reduction).

In the 2011 census, Hackney had the highest rate of commuters travelling by bicycle in London.

==Education==
In 2002, the borough entered into a 10-year contract with the Learning Trust, an independent collaborative body that organises education for Hackney&#x27;s 27,000 pupils in over 70 schools, nurseries and play centres. The trust was set up in response to an OFSTED report that identified failings in the then existing system. Two of London&#x27;s most successful City Academies are in Hackney with another two in development and plans to rebuild or renovate every other Hackney school by 2016.
LBH regained responsibility for education in 2012, absorbing the Learning Trust under the new name &quot;Hackney Learning Trust&quot;.

=== Public libraries ===
The London Borough of Hackney has eight public libraries:

==Transport==

Local services on the Lea Valley Lines passed into London Overground on 31 May 2015. Trains originate at London Liverpool Street and head towards either Enfield Town (via Bush Hill Park), Cheshunt (via Turkey Street) or Chingford (via Clapton).

It is proposed that Crossrail 2 will provide Hackney a new station at Dalston with the potential of the future &#x27;eastern branch&#x27; with stops at Hackney Central and Hackney Wick.

<text>Cockfosters is a suburb of north London to the east of Chipping Barnet, lying partly in the London Borough of Enfield and partly in the London Borough of Barnet. Before 1965, it was in the counties of Middlesex and Hertfordshire.

==Origins and popular attractions==
The name was recorded as far back as 1524 and is thought to be either the name of a family or that of a house which stood on Enfield Chase. One suggestion is that it was &quot;the residence of the cock forester (or chief forester)&quot;.

Of note in Cockfosters is Trent Park, now a country park. Christ Church, Cockfosters, an Anglican evangelical church, was founded in 1839. Christ the King, Cockfosters (Vita et Pax), a Catholic church, was founded in 1930. The Piccadilly line of the London Underground reached Cockfosters in 1933. The Cock Inn (formerly the Cock), off Cockfosters Road on Chalk Lane, opened in 1798.

==Geography==
==Education==
Southgate School is located on Sussex Way.

Trent C of E Primary School is located on Chalk Lane.

==Theatre and the arts==
The Chickenshed Theatre Company, founded in 1975 in a chicken shed before relocating to its current site, originated the concept of inclusive theatre.

==Sport and leisure==
Cockfosters has a non-League football club, Cockfosters F.C., which plays at the Cockfosters Sports Ground.

The Saracens used to play at Chase Side (also known as Clocktower Park); however, they are now based in Hendon. The ground is still used for Enfield F.C. training and for the Saracens&#x27; &#x27;B&#x27; team, Saracens Storm. It is also used as Saracens Amateurs&#x27; training ground.

Cockfosters Cricket Club and Southgate Compton Cricket Club play at Chalk Lane on fields adjacent to Christ Church, either side of Cockfosters Bowling Club.

Trent Country Park covers approximately and features treetop adventure park Go Ape.

Cockfosters has its own electoral ward in the Enfield borough. The 2011 census of Cockfosters ward counted a population of 16,137. The ethnic composition was 73.7% white (51.7% British, 19.7% Other, 2.2% Irish), 13.5% Asian (6.5% Indian), and 8% black (2.9% African). The most spoken foreign languages were Turkish and Greek.

<text>Coulsdon (, traditionally pronounced ) is a town in south London, England, within the London Borough of Croydon. Coulsdon was an ancient parish in the county of Surrey that included the settlements of Purley and Kenley. It was merged with Sanderstead in 1915 to form the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District and has formed part of Greater London since 1965.

==History==

The location forms part of the North Downs. The hills contain chalk and flint. A few dry valleys with natural underground drainage merge and connect to the main headwater of the River Wandle, as a winterbourne (stream), so commonly called &quot;the Bourne&quot;.
Although this breaks onto the level of a few streets when the water table is exceptionally high, the soil is generally dry. The depression and wind gap was a natural route across the Downs for early populations.

Fossil records exist from the Pleistocene period (about 4,000,000 years ago).

There is evidence of human occupation from the Neolithic period, Iron Age, Anglo-Saxon, Bronze Age, Roman and Medieval. 
In 675, Frithwald, an Ealdorman and viceroy of King Wulfhere of Mercia, gave land at Cuthraedesdune to Chertsey Abbey. It appears as &quot;Colesdone&quot; in the Domesday Book.
In 1537, the Dissolution of the monasteries passed ownership to the King.

In 1545, Henry VIII granted two homes with land in Whattingdon and Coulsdon, &quot;Welcombes&quot; and &quot;Lawrences&quot;, to Sir John Gresham, the manor having been owned by Chertsey Abbey in the 8th century, when it was recorded as &quot;Whatindone&quot;.

The Coulsdon Manor was granted or sold in 1553 to various families, including Sir Nicholas Carew (1553), Sir Francis Carew (1557), Jerome Weston, 2nd Earl of Portland, Sir Richard Mason, Sir Edward Darcy, Sir Robert Darcy and Sir Edward Bouverie (see Earl of Radnor).

From 1782 to 1921, it was owned by three generations of the Byron family, who had already purchased the sub-manor of Hooley.

In 1801, the Byron family moved to live at Hooley House. Then, having sold a large amount of land in 1838 to the &#x27;London to Brighton railway company&#x27;, they moved from Hooley House to Portnall&#x27;s Farm.

In 1850, Hartley Farm was demolished and Coulsdon Court was built by Thomas Byron. It was said to have been constructed of the last bricks to be made locally at Crossways (at Coulsdon Road, Old Coulsdon). In 1854, to avoid the court, he adjusted the paths of some local roads, and created a gated drive from the public road.

In 1863, Edmund Byron inherited the title. After his use of the inclosure acts was curtailed when he lost a case in 1877 at the Court of Chancery, large areas were sold in 1883 to the Corporation of London. The importance of this event was reported in &quot;The Times&quot;. He also sold and gave away various plots.

In 1921, Edmund Byron died. The remaining lands owned by the Byrons were sold. Land and manorial rights were passed to the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council.

For many centuries, the lands contained several farms and manors and only on the coming of the railway were a few wealthy people from outside the traditional borders attracted to build grand houses, by 19th century descriptions, such as:

Until 1921, the Byron family had largely maintained this tradition, despite sales of earlier land. The sales in the 1860s increased the number of landowners. Most housing in Smitham (Bottom/Valley) and the clustered settlement of Old Coulsdon, as well as the narrower valley between them, was built in the 80 years from 1890 to 1970. The area developed mixed suburban, and in its centre urban, housing:
The valley and routes in Smitham Bottom encouraged some early settlements. An inn, the Red Lion, appears on the Bainbridge map of 1783. The coming of the railway and improved road links encouraged buildings along the sides of the major roadways and close to the stations. Since 1921, the sales of the old estate lands have replaced a countryside of discrete farms with thousands of suburban dwellings.

Coulsdon segregated its long-haul from its local traffic with the construction of the Farthing Way A23 bypass, which opened in December 2006 as part of the Coulsdon Town Centre Improvement Scheme.

==Quarrying==
The Hall family had been active in the Croydon area as coal and lime merchants since the 18th. In 1853 they leased an area of land in Coulsdon. In 1864 they closed their quarries at Merstham and increased their quarrying for chalk and flints and use of lime kilns in Coulsdon.

This quarry at Coulsdon (Marlpit Lane) was named the &#x27;Stoats Nest Quarry&#x27;. The works had its own internal railway system which connected to nearby main lines.

In 1898, the Hall family were refused permission (by their landlord) to build cement works on the Coulsdon site.

The lime principally supplied for waterworks, gas works and tanneries. Demand reduced in 1902 when the Army changed from leather to webbing equipment. And in 1905 there was no longer demand from the gasworks.

Between 1905 and 1910 chalk was supplied for the Halls&#x27; cement works at Beddington. In 1905, 13,000 tons of chalk were sent by rail from Coulsdon. By 1918, it was processing lime for use as fertilizer.

In 1920, the Hall company purchased 102 acres from their landlord, Byron. This offered their full benefit of the railways and kilns on the land.

Halls maintained a trading depot in the Marlpit Lane quarry from 1923. It was named the &quot;Ullswater trading estate&quot;. The limeworks closed in 1961, and a park now lies in its place.

==Toponymy==
The town&#x27;s spelling, pronunciation and location have changed. Coulsdon originally referred to the area now known as Old Coulsdon.

The name derives from Cuðrædsdun via Cullesdone pre-1130, Culesdone pre-1190, Cullisdon 1242, Culesdene 1255, Colendone c1270, Kulisdon 1279, Collesdon 1288, Cullesdon 1323, Colleston 1324, Coulesdon 1346, Cullysdon 1377, Colynsdon 1428, Colysdon 1439, Collysdon 1563, Cowlesdon 1557, Coulsdon 1597, Cowisden 1604, Couldisdon 1610, Couldesdon 1675, Culsdon 1678, Colsdon 1724.

Additional variations include Curedesdone 675, Cudredesdone 675, Cudredesdune 967, Coulsdon 1083, Colesdone 1085, Culesdon 1234, Culisdon 1242, Cudredestreow 1251, Cullesdon 1266, Colesdene 1287, Colesdon 1290, Colesdun 1290, Culesdon 1291, Culesden 1292, Colieston 1324, Coulesden 1326, Coueleston 1332, Colisdon 1344, Culeston 1346, Cullysdon 1377, Cullisdoun 1403, Cullesdoun 1422, Culledon 1424, Colynsdon 1428, Collesdon 1439, Culsdon 1446, Cowlesdon 1539, Collesden 1544, Cowlesdowne 1553, Cullesdoy 1556, Colsdon 1558, Cowlesden 1558, Cullesden 1558, Cowllysdon 1567, Cowisden 1618, Coulsden 1619, Cowsdon 1620, Coolsden 1650, Coulesden 1650, Coilsoun 1655, Coulden 1655.

The widely accepted origin of the name is ‘hill of a man called Cūthrǣd’, (from OE pers. name + dūn, a hill). Alternatively the name originates from the Celtic or primitive Welsh &quot;cull&quot;, meaning a leather bag, scrotum, bosom, womb or belly.

The current town centre appears as Leydown Cross (1738) or Leaden Cross (1800) and Smitham Bottom. In 1905, the parish council, and then the Post Office renamed &quot;Smitham bottom&quot; as &quot;Coulsdon&quot;.
The name &quot;Smitham Bottom&quot; has also changed. Smetheden (1331), Smithdenbottom (1536), Smythedean(e)(1548), Smythden Bottom (1588), Smitham Bottom (1719)

==Local government==
Coulsdon was an ancient parish in the county of Surrey that included the settlements of Purley and Kenley. In 1894 it became part of Croydon Rural District. The population of the parish had almost doubled between 1901 and 1911. In 1915 the rural district was split up and Coulsdon was merged with Sanderstead to form the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District. In 1965 Coulsdon and Purley became part of the London Borough of Croydon in Greater London.

==Localities==
Coulsdon is a largely suburban district of London. The central area has substantial industrial, automotive and distribution services, convenience, standard socialising and niche retail as well as local professions of a typical town in the country, by its main road and main railway stations: Coulsdon South and Coulsdon Town. The alternate centre, Old Coulsdon, has a recreation ground/cricket pitch-focused village green, a much smaller parade of shops than Coulsdon&#x27;s high street between Coulsdon South and Town stations and a medieval church. London&#x27;s &#x27;Brighton Road&#x27;, locally the official name, and the railways, served by both semi-fast and stopping services, give Smitham Bottom/Valley a bustling, busier setting for economic life.

===Old Coulsdon===
Old Coulsdon occupies the south-east of the district. Scattered, rather than clustered, are six buildings listed for their national heritage and architectural value, at Grade II. Two categories above this, in the highest class, Grade I, is the Church of St John the Evangelist. This is by the recreation ground, shortly after Marlpit Lane has been joined by Coulsdon Road, from the north. St John&#x27;s is late thirteenth century with extensive later additions, made of flint and rubble with much brick patching. Its nave spans two (window) bays. Older still is its &quot;good&quot; chancel of 1250 with stepped sedilia and piscina. The west tower above the entrance is of circa 1400 with corner buttresses and a tapering broach spire. A nave at right angles, replacing the south aisle, in decorated style, was designed for its 1958 construction by J. B. S. Comper.

===Smitham Bottom or Valley===
At the heart of the geographical feature Smitham Bottom (where three dry valleys merge into one) is this downtown part of the district. Most commerce and industry is here, set beside the Brighton Road, which is since 2006 a town centre arc of the A23 road and on Chipstead Valley Road which terminates halfway along the arc, leading directly to Woodmansterne. The various local feeder roads reach this street, including the combined one from the south-east, Marlpit Lane, under the A23 without needing a junction with that trunk (long-distance) route (which later becomes the M23).

The soil is dry, and water was obtained even in 1912 by deep wells here in the chalk. This dry valley in the chalk, Smitham Bottom, has a watercourse below, the water of which in until the 16th century occasionally in times of flood ran here but after this, inexplicably, waits to break out as far as at the foot of the chalk in Croydon and Beddington, running through it.

===The Marlpit business and industrial estate===
Marlpit (a former chalk quarry) is the town&#x27;s Marlpit Industrial / Business Park estate, which is strong in storage, distribution and technology.

===The Mount or Clockhouse===
&quot;The Mount&quot; or &quot;Clockhouse&quot; is a square neighbourhood on a hill plateau with marked borders along three residential roads from Coulsdon, one of which continues from the town centre as the London Loop path, via the Banstead Downs and East Ewell to Nonsuch Palace north-west. It shares its local authority with that place as it is part of the London Borough of Sutton.

===Coulsdon Woods===
This neighbourhood is a loosely defined residential part of Coulsdon, equally on undulating ground.

=== Cane Hill ===
This area forms the area of the former buildings and grounds of Cane Hill Hospital; there had been proposals to expand this again in the late 1990s, but these were delayed and then cancelled.

An approved development of the former site of Cane Hill Hospital by Barratt Developments and David Wilson Homes, an associated organisation, gained planning permission, and started in about 2015, with intent to create over six hundred new dwellings. In 2013, Barratt published a Public Consultation document and report of feedback.
Some residents protested concerns relating to the likely effect on local infrastructure, including access routes, the proposed mix of housing, transport, notably road traffic, and the provision of educational services.

In 2016 planning application approvals were finalised and the development of 677 homes on the 210-acre site was later completed in November, 2021.

==Open spaces==
In 1883, to prevent further loss of common lands arising from the inclosure acts, the Corporation of London (under provisions of the Corporation of London (Open Spaces) Act 1878), purchased from Squire Byron (Lord of the Manor of Coulsdon) Farthing Downs, Coulsdon Common and Kenley Common, to add to the earlier purchase of Riddlesdown Common. The London Borough of Croydon own and maintain several parks, including Happy Valley, which, together with Farthing Downs, is designated is a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

Rickman Hill Park is the highest public park in London, at 155 metres above sea level.

A memorial park and recreation ground was purchased from the Byrons by Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council and Hall &amp; Co Ltd in 1920, it was opened in 1921.

The London Loop footpath passes through Happy Valley and Farthing Downs between Hamsey Green and Banstead. The Coulsdon section was the first of the 24 to be opened.

Grange Park was obtained partly by Public Subscription but mostly by Coulsdon and Purley Urban District Council in 1929 from the owners of the Coulsdon Court Golf Course. The land was sold for use as an open space or pleasure and recreation ground. Grange Park was formerly part of Squire Byrons Coulsdon Court Estate. Grange Park is situated in a designated conservation area in the heart of Old Coulsdon and incorporates a children&#x27;s play area and recreational green space. In total, Grange Park represents local green space of around 8 acres.

==Places of religious interest==
Places of worship include:
* St Mary and St Shenouda Coptic Orthodox Church, which was visited by the then Coptic Pope in 2017. 
* St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican church. From 1914.
* St Aidan&#x27;s Roman Catholic church from 1964.
* The Brighton Road Methodist church. From 1911.
* Beit Hallel Messianic Synagogue
* St John&#x27;s Anglican church (Old Coulsdon)
* St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic church (Old Coulsdon)
* Old Coulsdon Congregational Church
* Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses

==Leisure==
Athletics: The Old Coulsdon Hash House Harriers (or &quot;OCH3&quot;) is a local hashing group.

Gordon Pirie (1931–1991), an English long-distance runner lived in Coulsdon and was a member of South London Harriers, one of the oldest and most successful athletics club in Britain. The club has been based in Coulsdon since 1913, and remains there to this day. The club competes in cross-country, road running and track and field events, and trains from its Coulsdon HQ three times a week. The club has been heavily involved in recent years in building an eight lane all weather running track at Woodcote School. It also has an active and successful triathlon section.

Bare-knuckle boxing fights were held at Smitham Bottom. Records exist of fights in 1788 and 1792.

Bowls has been played at the Marlpit Lane Recreation Ground since the 1920s. A separate team played at the Ashdown Park Hotel.

Chess has been played from 1949.

Old Coulsdon had one of the first cricket clubs in the world, founded in 1762. It was one of the strongest teams in the country in the late 18th and early 19th century and once boasted eight England internationals, as well as a young Stuart Surridge. The club was possibly the first to use three stumps and two bails and frequently played matches on the most famous early cricket grounds such as Mitcham, and later in Grange Park in the village. In 1995 falling player numbers forced the club to merge with the nearby Redhill Cricket Club, playing at the Ring on Earlswood Common in the Earlswood neighbourhood of Redhill as &quot;Redhill &amp; Old Coulsdon Cricket Club&quot;. Cricket was originally played at &#x27;Smitham Bottom&#x27; opposite the Red Lion. The first archived results come from a games was played in 1731 (Surrey vs East Grinstead). A &#x27;Cricket Shed&#x27; appears in Smitham Bottom as a fixed building in a map of 1785. In the 1880s, this area became was built over, and the club moved to Old Coulsdon. From the 1920s, cricket was played at The Memorial Gardens.

A cycling group meets at the Temperance Hotel.

Coulsdon United Football Club participated in the Combined Counties League.

Golf is played at Woodcote Park Golf Club (since 1920) and at Coulsdon Manor. Green bowls is available next door. Ashdown Park Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1912. The club did not appear following WW1.

Horse riding is available on the downs. Coulsdon has wide and long pavements and indoor cafés from which to watch any of the London-Brighton rallies (vintage cars, minis, Land Rovers, vintage commercial vehicles, motorbikes, cycling etc.).

Yoshin Ryu was originally started in the late seventies as a collection of clubs based in youth centres and sports halls around the Croydon area run by founder and senior coach Errol Field, 7th dan Judo, 5th dan Karate (Shotokan), 6th dan jujitsu. Coulsdon Martial Arts is on the site of what was originally a &#x27;tin&#x27; church built by the Roman Catholic Church in 1916. The church building located on this site was purchased in the mid-1990s and converted into a full-time dojo and club HQ. The club president is Mr Brian Jacks – 10th Dan Judo, Olympic Judo medallist, holder of several European and World Judo titles. His bronze medal from the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich was donated to the club and can be seen on display in the foyer.

==Railway==
1804. The Surrey Iron Railway was enhanced by the &quot;Coulsdon Merstham &amp; Godstone Railway&quot;. These were horsedrawn railways which carried quarried materials and crops from Coulsdon and Merstham, and returned with fuel, metals and other materials.
To maintain a regular elevation at Coulsdon required large changes in direction and the construction of 20 ft embankments and a road bridge. Remnants of the 1805 railway embankment are still evident. The railway closed in 1838 due to underuse. A bridge over the Chipstead Valley road was demolished as dangerous in 1854.

1841. The London &amp; Brighton Railway line opened.

1856. The Caterham railway opened. Initially intended to serve residents of Old Coulsdon, a station named &#x27;Coulsdon&#x27; opened; later to be renamed &#x27;Kenley&#x27;.

1893. Authorisation was given for a new (second) line to be built between Purley and Kingwood. This was the Chipstead Valley Railway which was later extended to become the Tattenham Corner line. Constructed by the South Eastern Railway in 1896, it opened in 1897 as a single-track line.

1900. The main line between Croydon and Coulsdon was widened. A new (third) line was opened added named the Quarry Line between Coulsdon North and Earlswood (bypassing Redhill). Constructed 1898–9. The line involved engineering work including cuttings, embankments and a covered way at Cane Hill Hospital.

1923. Various station names changes, following amalgamations between various Railway companies.

<doc id="93941" wikidata="Q134102" url="?curid=93941" title="Organisation internationale de la Francophonie">
<text>The &#x27; (OIF; sometimes shortened to La Francophonie&quot;, , sometimes also calledInternational Organisation of in English) is an [[international organization]] representing where there is a notable affiliation with [[French language]] and [[Culture of France|culture]]. It is also called theFrench Commonwealth&quot;&#x27;.

The organization comprises 93 member states and governments; of these, 56 states and governments are full members, 5 are associate members and 32 are observers. The term (with a lowercase &quot;f&quot;), or &quot;francosphere&quot; (often capitalized in English), also refers to the global community of French-speaking peoples, comprising a network of private and public organizations promoting equal ties among countries where French, Belgian, Swiss, Canadian people or France, Belgium, Switzerland or Quebec play a significant historical role, culturally, militarily, or politically.

The organisation was created in 1970. Most of its founding members and current full members used to be parts of the French colonial empire. Its headquarters is located in Paris, France. Its motto is &quot;, , &quot; (&quot;equality, complementarity, and solidarity&quot;), a deliberate allusion to France&#x27;s motto . Starting as a small group of French-speaking countries, the Francophonie has since evolved into a global organization whose numerous branches cooperate with its member states in the fields of culture, science, economy, justice, and peace. Its mission is to promote the French language and cultural and linguistic diversity, promote peace, democracy and human rights, and support education, research, and cooperative development. It is an observer of the United Nations (UN).

== History ==
The convention which created the Agency for Cultural and Technical Co-operation (Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique) was signed on 20 March 1970 by the representatives of the 21 states and governments under the influence of African Heads of State, Léopold Sédar Senghor of Senegal, Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, Hamani Diori of Niger and Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia. Canadian Jean-Louis Roy was the first, and only, secretary-general of the organization from 1989 until 1997.

Based on the sharing of the French language, the missions of this new intergovernmental organization are the promotion of the cultures of its members and the intensification of the cultural and technical cooperation between them, as well as the solidarity and the connection between them through dialogue.

The Francophonie project ceaselessly evolved since the creation of the Agency for Cultural and Technical Co-operation, it became the intergovernmental Agency of the Francophonie (Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie) in 1997 to remind its intergovernmental status. Finally in 2005, the adoption of a new Charter of the Francophonie (&quot;la Charte de la Francophonie&quot;) gives the name to the Agency of international Organisation of the Francophonie (&quot;Organisation internationale de la Francophonie&quot;).

== Structure ==

===Executive Secretariat (Secretaries-General)===
The position of Secretary-General was created in 1997 at the seventh leaders&#x27; summit held in Hanoi. Canadian Jean-Louis Roy was secretary of the &quot;Agence de coopération culturelle et technique&quot; from 1989 until the formal creation of the &quot;Agence intergouvernementale de la Francophonie&quot; in 1997 with former Secretary-General of the United Nations Boutros Boutros-Ghali as the first secretary-general of &quot;La Francophonie&quot;. Abdou Diouf, the former president of the Republic of Senegal, became Secretary General on January 1, 2003. He was reelected on 29 September 2006, for a second mandate during the Summit of the Francophonie of Bucharest, and elected again in 2010 at the Summit of the Francophonie of Montreux for another mandate which ran until 31 December 2014. At the 2014 summit in Dakar, former Governor General of Canada Michaëlle Jean was chosen to lead the organization starting in January 2015.

The Secretary General of the Francophonie is elected during the Summit, and serves as the spokesperson and the official representative internationally of the political actions of the Francophonie. The Secretary General is responsible for proposing priority areas for multilateral Francophonie actions. Their job is to facilitate Francophone multilateral cooperation and to ensure that programs and activities of all operating agencies work in harmony. The Secretary General carries out their four-year mandate under the authority of the three main institutions of the Francophonie: the Summits, the Ministerial Conference and the Permanent Council.

===Summits===
The Summit, the highest authority in the Francophonie, is held every two years and gathers the heads of states and governments of all member states of the OIF around certain themes of discussion. It is chaired by the head of state or government of the host country and this person assumes that responsibility until the next summit. By enabling the heads of state and government to hold a dialogue on all international issues of the day, the summit serves to develop strategies and goals of the Francophonie so as to ensure the organisation&#x27;s influence on the world scene.

===Ministerial Conference===
The Ministerial Conference of the Francophonie gathers the foreign or francophone affairs ministers of member states and governments every year to ensure the political continuity of the Summit. This conference ensures that the decisions made during the previous Summits are carried out and to plan the next Summit. It also recommends new members and observers to the Summit.

===Permanent Council===
The Permanent Council of the Francophonie gathers the Ambassadors of the member countries, chaired by the General Secretary of the Francophonie and under the authority of the Ministerial Conference, its main task is to plan Summits. This conference also supervises the execution of the Summit decisions made by the ministerial conferences on a day-to-day basis, about the examination of the propositions of the budget distribution.

===Parliamentary Assembly===
The objectives of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Francophonie (APF) are to represent to the French-speaking authorities, the interests of the French-speaking communities, to promote the democracy, the rule of law and the respect of human rights. Furthermore, it follows the execution by the operators of the Francophonie of action plans elaborated by the Conference of the members using French as a common language It also favours the cooperation and strengthens the solidarity within the French-speaking communities, mainly towards the parliaments of the South. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Francophonie is constituted by member sections representing 77 parliaments or interparliamentary organizations. The Secretary General is the French senator Jacques Legendre.

===Agency of the Francophonie===
The Agency of the Francophonie is the main operator of the cultural, scientific, technical, economic and legal cooperation programs decided at the Summits. It is also the legal seat of the Secretary General and is used by him as an administrative support. The agency also contributes to the development of the French language and to the promotion of the diverse languages and cultures of its members, while encouraging mutual understanding between them and the Francophonie. For this reason, it is a place of exchange and dialogue and its simultaneous in Francophone countries.
The Agency&#x27;s headquarters are in Paris and it has three regional branches in Libreville, Gabon; Lomé, Togo; and Hanoi, Vietnam.

== Members ==

Mauritania&#x27;s membership was suspended on 26 August 2008, pending democratic elections, after a military coup d&#x27;état. Madagascar&#x27;s membership was suspended in April 2009 due to an unconstitutional transfer of power on 17 March 2009. Mali&#x27;s membership was also suspended in March 2012 due to a coup d&#x27;état, and then the Central African Republic was suspended at the 88th session of the CPF (March 2012), as well as Guinea-Bissau on 18 April 2012 for the same reason. Thailand, an observer nation, was suspended in 2014 following the 2013–14 political crisis. In 2018, Louisiana became the first US state to join, as an observer. In 2021, the government of Nova Scotia announced its intention to apply for observer status.

Although the French language is popular in Algeria and Algeria used to be a colony and later an internal part of France for a long time, it is currently not a member of the organisation.

==Operating agencies==
The International Organization of the Francophonie relies on five operating agencies to carry out its mandate: l&#x27;Agence Universitaire de la Francophonie (AUF); TV5Monde; l&#x27;Association Internationale des Maires Francophones (AIMF); l&#x27;Association des Fonctionnaires Francophones des Organisations Internationales (AFFOI); and l&#x27;Université Senghor d&#x27;Alexandrie.

===Association of Francophone Universities (AUF)===
Established in 1961 in Montreal, the Association of Francophone Universities gathers institutions of higher education and research among the Francophone countries of Africa, the Arab world, Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and the Caribbean.

Its mission is to contribute to the construction and consolidation of a scientific space in French. It supports the French language, cultural and linguistic diversity, law and democracy, and the environment and sustainable development. It also provides an important mobility program for the students, the researchers and the professors.

Its mission is to support the French language and the linguistic diversity within International Organisations. Every year the association coordinates the day of French language within International Organisations. It also organizes seminaries to increase awareness about the importance of linguistic, cultural and conceptual diversity. The president is the French international civil servant Dominique Hoppe.

===TV5Monde, the French-speaking international television===
TV5Monde is the first international French language television network, available in many countries. On television and online the audience of TV5Monde has grown rapidly. TV5 is one of the three largest television networks in the world (along with the BBC and CNN), and is considered one of the greatest achievements of the Francophonie. It provides wide access to original television programmes in French, and contributes to the development of the language and French-speaking cultures. It broadcasts the different forms of the French language spoken around the world, with all their accents. It reaches beyond native speakers of French; the majority of those who can receive it and part of its audience comprise viewers for whom French is not the mother tongue. Thanks to subtitles in various languages, it provides access to the Francophonie to non-French speakers - it is translated into 12 languages.

===International Association of French-speaking Mayors===
The International Association of French-speaking Mayors was created in Quebec City in 1979 Jean Pelletier and Jacques Chirac, then the respective mayors of Quebec City and Paris with an initial group of 20 founder-cities. It is an operating agency for urban development gathering 48 countries or governments. The goal is to establish close cooperation in all areas of municipal activities. Its missions are to strengthen local democracy, building municipal capacities, and to support the populations. The association pursues its actions in the domains of health, culture, youth and education, urban development, training, and municipal infrastructures.

The association is presided by Anne Hidalgo (Paris&#x27; mayor) since 2009, with Pierre Baillet as permanent secretary.

===Senghor University of Alexandria===

The project of creating a French-speaking university in the service of African development was presented and adopted following the Dakar Summit in 1989. The Senghor University in Alexandria, Egypt is a private postgraduate institution that trains managers and high-level trainers in areas that are a priority for development in Francophone Africa. It directs the capacities of the managers and trainers to the action and the exercise of responsibilities in certain domains for the development: the project management, the financial institutions, the environment, the nutrition-health and of the cultural heritage. The Senghor University regularly organizes seminaries to help its students and of the public specialized in the domains of its action, by collaborating with the other operators and the institutions of the Francophonie.

== Missions ==
The International Organization of the Francophonie leads political actions and multilateral cooperation according to the missions drawn by the Summits of the Francophonie. The Summits gather the Heads of states and governments of the member countries of the International Organization of the Francophonie where they discuss international politics, world economy, French-speaking cooperation, human rights, education, culture and democracy. Actions of the International Organization of the Francophonie are scheduled over a period of four years and funded by contributions from its members.

The &quot;Charte de la Francophonie&quot; defines the role and missions of the organization. The current charter was adopted in Antananarivo, on 23 November 2005. The summit held in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso on 26–27 November 2004 saw the adoption of a strategic framework for the period 2004–2014.

The four missions drawn by the Summit of the Francophonie are:
# Promoting French language and cultural and linguistic diversity.
# Promoting peace, democracy and human rights.
# Supporting education, training, higher education and scientific research.
# Expand cooperation for sustainable development.

===French language, cultural and linguistic diversity===
The primary mission of the organization is the promotion of the French language as an international language and the promotion of worldwide cultural and linguistic diversity in the era of economic globalization. In this regard, countries that are members of the Francophonie have contributed largely to the adoption by the UNESCO of the (20 October 2005).

At the national level, there is the problem of promoting the French language within the context of its co-existence with other partner or international languages in most member countries, especially in Africa. Maintaining the relative importance of the status of French is an imperative that requires solidarity and the pooling of means and resources among countries committed to the French language within their respective societies.

The Francophonie has been a pioneer in terms of the recognition of cultural diversity and dialogue of cultures. It must find ways of confronting the trend towards uniformity that accompanies globalization and fostering the preservation and development of cultural diversity.

===Peace, democracy and human rights===
Similar to the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Francophonie has as its stated aims the promotion of democracy and human rights. Following the 3 November 2000 &quot;Déclaration de Bamako&quot;, the Francophonie has given itself the financial means to attain a number of set objectives in that regard.

The Francophonie intends to contribute significantly to promoting peace, democracy and support for the rule of law and human rights by focusing on prevention. Political stability and full rights for all, the subject of the Bamako declaration, are considered key to sustainable development.

The Francophonie has chosen to provide its member countries with access to the expertise of its extensive intergovernmental, institutional, academic and non-governmental network with a view to building national capacities, resolving conflict and providing support for ending crises.

In recent years, some participating governments, notably the governments of Canada and Quebec, pushed for the adoption of a Charter in order for the organization to sanction member States that are known to have poor records when it comes to the protection of human rights and the practice of democracy. Such a measure was debated at least twice but was never approved.

===Supporting education, training, higher education and research===
The International Organization of the Francophonie aims at connecting the various peoples using French as a common language through their knowledge. Education, like access to autonomy and information for all, begins with all children having access to a full primary education free of any inequality. It involves an integrated approach of teaching and training from primary to secondary school that will lead to employment. Education policies must also give French an integral place alongside the partner languages. Last, the research potential of French-language academic streams must be promoted.

===Cooperation for sustainable development===
The Francophonie is committed to working towards sustainable development by supporting the improvement of economic governance, capacity building, cooperation and the search for common positions in major international negotiations.
It&#x27;s necessary to manage durably the natural resources, particularly the energy and the water, and politics are established to make sure of the conservation of these resources with effective anti-poverty campaigns.

In 2013, the United Nations Volunteers programme received a financial contribution from the Federal Public Service (FPS) Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Kingdom of Belgium for the years 2013 and 2014 to support the outreach to the francophone world and the promotion of volunteerism via its Online Volunteering service.

==Criticism of the organisation==

===Neo-colonialism===
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry on 28 June 2024, the OIF created in 1970 still plays an important role in promoting French cultural neo-colonialism. Such predatory cooperation treaties containing the above terms and conditions were concluded with, among others, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad (1960), Republic of the Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Madagascar, Mali, Niger (1961), Senegal, Togo (1963), and Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso). According to Russians, France strongly promoted French language and culture by funding educational and cultural projects to the detriment of local languages and culture which helped maintain cultural influence and provided training of personnel which was loyal to France. Young people from the former colonies were granted scholarships to study in France, which helped strengthen ties and create French elite. This critique exists in the context of growing Russian State propaganda targeting Africa. Evidence suggests Russia has been amplifying anti-Western post-colonial grievances in Africa through disinformation campaigns.

===Proliferation of non-Francophone member states and missions===
The membership of the OIF has climbed from 21 in 1970 to 88 member states and territories in 2018. This sharp increase in the number of member states, many of whom have little to no connection with the French language and culture, has been a matter of growing concern. In their 1996 study on the Francophone space, linguists Daniel Baggioni and Roland Breton pointed out, alluding to the applications of Bulgaria and Angola to join the OIF, that only politico-diplomatic criteria could explain these odd extensions of the OIF. Xavier Deniau, founder of the &quot;Association des parlementaires de langue française&quot; (now the Parliamentary assembly) and author of &quot;La Francophonie&quot;, expressed concern that the enlargement of the OIF to countries where French is practically nonexistent risks diluting the effectiveness of the organisation. Despite calls for a moratorium on the admission of new members, each new Sommet de la Francophonie has witnessed the admission of batches of new members that have little, if anything, to do with the French language: Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Dominican Republic, the United Arab Emirates, Estonia and Montenegro in 2010; Qatar and Uruguay in 2012; Mexico, Costa Rica and Kosovo in 2014. On that occasion, the Montreal daily Le Devoir, which reports extensively on the OIF and its summits, remarked that several members of this &quot;merry madhouse&quot; that the OIF had become did not even recognise Kosovo as a country. The &quot;endless enlargement&quot; of the Organisation accelerated following the arrival at the head of the OIF of former UN Secretary General Boutros-Ghali who declared early in his term in 1998 that French being in his opinion the language of solidarity, tolerance, respect for the individual, cultural diversity, universality and openness, the OIF needed to open itself to non francophones. The motivation of small and mid-size countries in joining the organisation appears to be a desire to increase their international visibility. In October 2018, the Irish Department for Foreign Affairs explained that Ireland&#x27;s accession with observer status would &quot;Develop and deepen Ireland’s institutional linkages with Africa&quot; and allow the country to &quot;play a more influential role in locations including the Sahel... and to engage on the challenges facing countries in French-speaking West Africa.&quot; A departmental review in May 2023 added that &quot;new Embassies in Senegal and Morocco represent Ireland’s first missions in francophone Africa and complement our recent accession as an observer member&quot;.

Following the arrival of Boutros-Ghali, the OIF had also seen a steady increase in the number of its missions and priority action areas — peace and conflict prevention, human rights, democracy, international cooperation, sustainable development, cultural and linguistic diversity, education and training, youth, gender equality, civil society — bringing a fundamental shift from the cultural to the political sphere. Jacques Legendre, the French senate&#x27;s rapporteur on the Francophonie, expressed his concern that the OIF was becoming &quot;a second-rate duplicate of the General Assembly of the UN&quot;. Many actors of the francophone sphere interested in the future of the organisation, including former French ministers or secretaries of state for the Francophonie such as Pierre-André Wiltzer and Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, have been calling on the OIF to refocus on its fundamentals: language and culture.

===Disregard for human rights and fundamental freedoms by member states===
Human rights and fundamental freedoms, despite having been declared &quot;categorical imperatives&quot; by Secretary General Boutros-Ghali in 1998, are routinely abused by many members states of the OIF. The deplorable track record of many OIF member states regarding human rights came to the fore during the 1999 Francophonie Summit in Moncton, Canada, when Canadian dailies loudly denounced the organisation&#x27;s silence regarding widespread human rights abuses by member states ruled by &quot;tyrants&quot;. It was pointed out that no less than 35 member states of the OIF had been accused of human rights violations by Amnesty International, while 15 member states were among the countries listed by Reporters Without Borders as systematically violating freedom of the press. Prime Minister Chrétien and President Chirac felt compelled to declare at the close of the summit that a human rights observatory would be established to tackle the problem. Given that during his 12-year tenure, President Chirac, dubbed &quot;Papa Afrique&quot; or &quot;Chirac l&#x27;Africain&quot;, had confided more than once that Africa was not ready for multi-party democracy (&quot;l&#x27;Afrique n&#x27;est pas mûre pour le multipartisme&quot;) and was known for his close relationship with many entrenched African strongmen, calling Omar Bongo of Gabon, Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo, Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo and Blaise Compaoré of Burkina Faso &quot;personal friends&quot;, nothing came out of this declaration. The French daily &quot;Le Monde&quot; noted at the time that if respect for fundamental freedoms was to become a criterion for membership in the OIF, the organisation would simply cease to exist.

French President Macron&#x27;s surprise announcement in May 2018 that France officially backed the nomination of Louise Mushikiwabo, Rwanda&#x27;s longtime foreign minister, as the next secretary general of the OIF was seen by many as a setback for the defense and promotion of human rights. An open letter signed by four former French ministers for international cooperation condemned this move, on one hand because it was taken unilaterally by the French president without consultation with the other member states of the organisation and on the other because it disregarded President Kagame&#x27;s lamentable track record on human rights. &quot;How will the Francophonie be able to promote freedom of the press, as part of its mission of advocating for human rights, if it&#x27;s headed by one of the key leaders of a country that&#x27;s trampled on media freedom and repressed journalists for 18 years?&quot; asked Christophe Deloire, secretary general of Reporters Without Borders.
