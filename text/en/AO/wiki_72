<text>LiveJournal (), stylised as LiVEJOURNAL, is a Russian-owned social networking service where users can keep a blog, journal, or diary. American programmer Brad Fitzpatrick started LiveJournal on April 15, 1999, as a way of keeping his high school friends updated on his activities. In January 2005, American blogging software company Six Apart purchased Danga Interactive, the company that operated LiveJournal, from Fitzpatrick.

Six Apart sold LiveJournal to Russian media company SUP Media in 2007; the service continued to operate out of the U.S. via a California-based subsidiary, LiveJournal, Inc., but began moving some operations to Russian offices in 2009. In December 2016, the service relocated its servers to Russia, and in April 2017, LiveJournal changed its terms of service to conform to Russian law. As with other social networks, a wide variety of public figures use the service, as do political pundits, who use it for political commentary, particularly in Russia, where it partners with the online newspaper &quot;Gazeta.ru&quot;.

==Features==
The unit of social networking on LiveJournal is quaternary (with four possible states of connection between one user and another). Two users can have no relationship, they can list each other as friends mutually, or either can &quot;friend&quot; the other without reciprocation.

The term &quot;friend&quot; on LiveJournal is mostly a technical term, but because it is emotionally loaded for many people, there have been discussions in such LiveJournal communities as &quot;lj_dev&quot; and &quot;lj_biz&quot; as well as &quot;suggestions&quot; about whether the term should be used this way.

A user&#x27;s list of friends (&quot;friends list&quot;, often shortened to &quot;flist&quot;) will often include several communities and RSS feeds in addition to individual users. Generally, &quot;friending&quot; allows a user&#x27;s friends to read protected entries and causes the friends&#x27; entries to appear on the user&#x27;s &quot;friends page&quot;. Friends can also be grouped together in &quot;friends groups&quot;, allowing for more complex behavior.

; Features common to all accounts
* Each journal entry has its own web page, which includes the comments left by other users. In addition, each user has a journal page, which shows all of their most recent journal entries, along with links to the comment pages.
* The most distinctive feature of LiveJournal is the &quot;friends list&quot;, which gives the site a strong social aspect in addition to the blog services. The friends list provides various syndication and privacy services, described below. Each user has a friends page, which collects the most recent journal entries of the people on their friends list.
* LiveJournal allows users to customize their accounts. The S2 programming language allows journal templates to be modified by members. Users may upload graphical avatars, or &quot;userpics&quot;, which appear next to the username in prominent areas as on an Internet forum. Paid account holders are given full access to S2 management and more userpics, as well as other features.
* Each user also has a &quot;User Info&quot; page, which contains a variety of data including contact information, a biography, images (linked from off-site sources) and lists of friends, interests, communities and even schools the user has attended in the past or is currently attending.
* LiveJournal has five account levels: basic (comprising approximately 95% of the network); plus (sponsored with more advertising); &quot;early adopters&quot; who were registered prior to 14 September 2000; paid; and permanent. Permanent accounts are normally not available to the average user; there have been occasional sale days or special offers, but such sales are not guaranteed in the future. Before March 12, 2008, basic accounts were ad-free; in August 2008, LiveJournal resumed new basic account creation but changed that account level to display ads to non-logged-in readers. Basic users also see advertising, but not on other basic journals.
*As well as allowing embedded videos from other sites, LiveJournal can host videos and allows users who have enabled the updated site design to post links to the hosted videos.

;Paid account features
* Sending Text Messages – users can receive text messages sent via LiveJournal without sharing their phone number. If the text messaging feature is set up, anyone (or any authorized user) can use LiveJournal to send text messages to their cellphone by following a link on the User Info page.
* &quot;To-do list&quot; feature – LiveJournal offers &quot;to-do lists&quot; for managing users goals and aims. Users can have 150 to-do list items. Each to-do list item must have a subject, priority, details and descriptions, status, percent done, due date and categories field.
* &quot;Express Lane&quot; – users with paid accounts have access to express lanes that make pages load faster. When logged into their Paid or Permanent Account during times of heavy site load, their requests for pages are sent to the web servers before other users&#x27; requests.
* &quot;Voice Post&quot; – members with paid accounts can call from any phone to a specific number, record the audio and upload it directly to their journal.
* &quot;Extra storage space&quot; – lets users store more Scrapbook photos and voice posts. Photos and voice posts that have been uploaded there are easy to include in the log entry.

==Community==
===User interaction===
As of 2014, LiveJournal in the United States had 10 million monthly uniques, 30 million monthly visitors, and 170 million pageviews.
As with most weblogs, people can comment on each other&#x27;s journal entries and create a message board-style thread of comments – each comment can be replied to individually, starting a new thread. All users, including non-paying users, can set various options for comments: they can instruct the software to only accept comments from those on their friends list or block anonymous comments (meaning only LiveJournal users can comment on their posts). They can also screen various types of comments before they are displayed, or disable commenting entirely. Users can also have replies sent directly to their registered e-mail address.

In addition, LiveJournal acts as host to group journals, dubbed &quot;communities&quot; (frequently abbreviated as &quot;comms&quot;). Anyone who joins a community can make posts to it as they would on a regular journal; communities also have &quot;maintainers&quot;, ordinary users who run the community and oversee membership and moderation.

===LiveJournal community===
LiveJournal community is a collective blog in which different users can post messages. Users who are interested in a particular subject can find or create a community for this subject. All the users of the communities are divided into:
* Owners who are supervising the community and capable to use all administrative functions that are available for managing the community.
* Maintainers usually use their own user accounts to supervise a community, control its settings and Community Info, perform some administrative functions.
* Moderators can approve or reject messages left by participants, add existing records label or tags, approve requests to join a community, hide and freeze comments.
* Members can see the community&#x27;s members-only entries. For Communities with fewer than 500 members, the entire Members list will be displayed on a Community Info page.
* Watchers can assign permissions, allow entry into the community, delete posts (messages) or hide comments on posts.

===Contributors===
Some areas of LiveJournal rely heavily on user contributions and volunteer efforts. In particular, the LiveJournal Support area is run almost entirely by unpaid volunteers. Similarly, the website is translated into other languages by volunteers, although this effort is running down due to a perceived lack of involvement from the LiveJournal administration.

The development of the LiveJournal software has seen extensive volunteer involvement in the past. In February and March 2003, there was an effort, nicknamed the &quot;Bazaar&quot;, to boost volunteer performance by offering money in return for &quot;wanted&quot; enhancements or improvements. The Bazaar was intended to follow a regular monthly pay-out scheme, but it ended up paying out only once, after which it was neglected by the management, and shut down one year later.

Nowadays, voluntary contributions to the software are considered for inclusion less and less as the company has acquired more and more paid employees who focus on the organization&#x27;s commercial interests. This has led to the formation of several forks, many of which introduce new features that users would like to see, especially features that are brought up repeatedly in LiveJournal&#x27;s own &quot;suggestions&quot; journal.

In some cases legal and administrative concerns have led LiveJournal to prohibit some people from volunteering.

===Demographics===

, 39,663,771 accounts exist on LiveJournal, with 1,790,795 listed as &quot;active in some way.&quot; Of those users who provided their date of birth, the majority were in the 17–25 age group, with an exceptionally large group of 32-year-olds. Among the users specifying their gender in their profile, 45% of those accounts identified as male, and 55% as female. One fifth, or 20%, of accounts did not specify a gender.

LiveJournal is most popular in English-speaking countries (although there is a language selection feature), and the United States has by far the most LiveJournal users among users who choose to list a location. There is also a sizable Russian contingent. LiveJournal is the largest online community on the Runet, with about 45% of all entries in the Russian blogosphere.

===Mascot: Frank the Goat===
Frank the Goat is LiveJournal&#x27;s mascot. During the early years of the site, Frank was treated like an actual living being by much of the LiveJournal userbase, and his brief &quot;biography&quot; as well as his &quot;journal&quot; reflect this.

Sometimes, callers to LiveJournal&#x27;s Voice Post service are informed &quot;Frank the Goat appreciates your call.&quot; This occurs randomly.

A weekly comic about Frank, written and drawn by cartoonist Ryan Estrada, was updated every Thursday on the &quot;Frank: The Comic Strip&quot; community on LiveJournal. As of July 2009 the community had roughly 8,000 members, and was watched by more than 7,000 LiveJournal users.

Beginning at the end of January 2010, LiveJournal&#x27;s weekly news posts included references to Frank&#x27;s life, becoming works of short fiction at the end of February. These pieces are often tied to weekly virtual gift promotions, where commenters that meet a certain criterion will receive a free v-gift sent by Frank.

== Content==
===Privacy===
LiveJournal provides an option intended to reduce the chances of search engines indexing a journal; however, the only way to make it completely impossible for such indexing to occur is to set the entry security to &quot;friends only&quot; or higher when first posting the entry. If an entry is first posted publicly, and then edited to reflect a higher security level, it may have already been indexed by a search engine in the time between the security edit. The popular &quot;friends only&quot; security option, which has since been adopted by Xanga and Myspace, hides a post from the general public so that only those on the user&#x27;s friends list can read it. Some users keep all their posts friends-only (except for a single post explaining that the journal is friends-only). Still, such features as tags and userpics cannot be hidden. LiveJournal also allows users to create custom user groups within their group of friends to further restrict who can read any particular post, and to allow reading of subsets of a user&#x27;s friends list.

LiveJournal additionally has a &quot;private&quot; security option which allows users to make a post that only the poster can read, thus making their LiveJournal a private diary rather than a blog. It is also possible to choose a default security setting for one&#x27;s journal, so that all entries are posted at that security level by default even if one forgets to alter the security setting at the time of posting.

Users may restrict who can comment on their posts in addition to who has the ability to read their posts. Comments on a given entry may be allowed from anyone who can read the entry or restricted. Commenting may be restricted by disabling commenting altogether or by screening comments. Screened comments are visible only to the original posters until the journal owner approves the comment. These restrictions can be applied to just anonymous users, users who aren&#x27;t listed as a friend, or everyone. The IP address of commenters can be logged as well if the journal owner wishes to enable it.

An option allows users to hide their &quot;friend of&quot; list from public view, but leaves the list visible to the user. In this case, only the friends list is shown. When &quot;friend of&quot; is allowed, journal accounts who have friended the user and who are also friended are listed in neither &quot;friend of&quot; nor &#x27;friend&quot;, but rather a third category, &quot;mutual friends&quot;. This was eventually made a separate option, like the &quot;friend of&quot; list, and reworded so that the lists would have to be selected to include them in a profile, rather than to select an option to remove them.

LiveJournal lists that users can hide communities from their profile page by not friending them (friended communities are &quot;watched&quot;) and by either banning the community from posting in their journal (which has no effect since they cannot anyway, but does remove them from the &quot;member of&quot; list) or by removing the &quot;friend of&quot; list, which removes the &quot;member of&quot; list in addition to the &quot;friend of&quot; list.

LiveJournal allows paid account users to change privacy settings on past entries in bulk. Basic and plus accounts do not have an official web-based method, and normally must manually change such settings one by one; some third party clients, such as Livejournal Visibility Changer, provide this functionality for non-paid users.

Communities can also be private, with moderated or closed membership, when community holders give users different level of access to the content, based on the information about the user.

===Adult content===
While LiveJournal permits adult-oriented content, it is a user&#x27;s responsibility to mark content as inappropriate for minors. There are two types of adult content:
* Adult concepts: This rating applies to content that is not explicitly graphic, but may contain things that are of a mature nature and could be inappropriate for anyone under the age of 14 years.
* Explicit adult: This rating applies to graphic and explicit content (depicting nudity, sexuality, violence in images and language) that is appropriate only for adults, and is not suitable for viewers under the age of 18 years.

Labeling as adult material does not convey in any way that this content is considered obscene, in the legal definition of the term. Such content should be marked in order to be shown only to users whose birth dates on their user information page indicate that they are over the age of 18. At the same time the user itself can set own preferences in viewing adult content settings in order not to receive such materials. All users are defaulted to &quot;Moderate Filtering&quot; in the &quot;Safe Search Filter&quot;, but can change this option.

It is written in the LiveJournal rules that if the content is reported as being offensive or inappropriate, LiveJournal has the right to flag, restrict access, or delete it at any time without notice.

==Notable LiveJournals and users==
Oh No They Didn&#x27;t, also known as ONTD, is the most popular community on LiveJournal, with over 100,000 members. The community&#x27;s primary interest is celebrity gossip, and most of its posts are taken and sourced from other gossip blogs. At the end of January 2009, &quot;Oh No They Didn&#x27;t!&quot; was the first LiveJournal to surpass 16,777,216 comments (224), effectively breaking LiveJournal&#x27;s previously undocumented limit on comments. This resulted in almost a week of downtime for the community, while LiveJournal worked to fix the issue.

In April 2010, the Oh No They Didn&#x27;t community was moved to its own database cluster to improve site performance for all users, due to its size and the amount of traffic it was receiving.

== History ==
===Founding and eventual sale to Six Apart===
LiveJournal&#x27;s parent company, Danga Interactive, was formed and held entirely by Brad Fitzpatrick.
He sold the company to Six Apart in 2005. Rumors of the impending sale were first reported by Business 2.0 journalist Om Malik in January, 2005. Fitzpatrick confirmed the sale, and insisted the site&#x27;s core principles would not be discarded by the new ownership.

In August 2007, Fitzpatrick left to work for Google. He continued to serve on the advisory board of LiveJournal, Inc until it was retired in June 2010.

===Sale to SUP Media===
LiveJournal became extremely popular in Russia. The Russian translation of LiveJournal – ЖЖ (&quot;ZheZhe&quot;, which stands for Живой Журнал) – has become a genericized trademark for blogging in Russia, and the community boasts approximately 700,000 Russian LiveJournals, with 300,000 of them being active.

Six Apart licensed the LiveJournal brand to the Russian company SUP Media in August 2006. The deal was brokered with Fitzpatrick&#x27;s assistance, but expatriated Russians have expressed concerns, citing links between the company and state security. Some have also worried that SUP&#x27;s purchase of the community was less to make a profit and more to curtail or even dissolve the strong independent Russian blogging community, silencing dissent the government found inconvenient. These concerns started with the licensing deal, and have grown with the announcement of LiveJournal&#x27;s sale to SUP Media in December 2007.

In a March 2008 interview, Anton Nosik, an advisor to SUP Media, accused LiveJournal users of &quot;trying to scare and blackmail us, threatening to destroy our business,&quot; and said that a large class of users are on LiveJournal only to harm it and its owners; &quot;their goal is to criticize, destabilize and ruin our reputation.&quot; Nosik said his likely reaction to such pressure would be to retaliate against the users rather than bowing to their pressure.

Despite stating that LiveJournal would maintain the majority of its operations in the United States via the local subsidiary LiveJournal, Inc., in January 2009 SUP laid off some employees and moved product development and design functions to Russia. In December 2016, LiveJournal moved to servers hosted in Russia; in April 2017, it changed its terms of service to conform to Russian law and to be written (in their official form) only in Russian.

==Controversies and criticism==
===Invite system===
From September 2, 2001, until December 12, 2003, the growth of LiveJournal was checked by an &quot;invite code&quot; system. This curbing of membership was necessitated by a rate of growth faster than the server architecture could handle. New users were required to either obtain an invite code from an existing user or buy a paid account (which reverted to a free account at the expiration of the period of time paid for). The invite code system serendipitously reduced abuse on the site by deterring people from creating multiple throw-away accounts. The invite code system was lifted after a number of major improvements to the overall site architecture.

Elimination of the invite code system was met with mixed feelings and some opposition. LiveJournal&#x27;s management pointed out that the invite code system had always been intended to be temporary.

===The word &quot;friend&quot;===
The dual usage of &quot;friends&quot; as those whose journals one reads, and those one trusts to read one&#x27;s own journal, has been criticized for being at odds with everyday use of the term. The individual users on a user&#x27;s friends list may contain a mixture of people met through real world friendships, online friendships and general interests, as well as courtesy friendships where a user has &quot;friended&quot; someone who friended them. A friends list may represent something entirely unrelated to social relationships, such as a reading list, a collection or a puzzle.

The difference between online and real-world friendships is sometimes a source of conflict, hurt feelings, and other misunderstandings. LiveJournal friendships are not necessarily mutual; any user can befriend or &quot;defriend&quot; any other user at any time.

In the Russian LiveJournal community, the word френд (&quot;friend&quot;, an English borrowing) is often used to describe this relationship instead of the native Russian word &quot;друг&quot; ([ drug ]) that translates to &quot;friend&quot;.

The Dreamwidth code fork of LiveJournal has split the &#x27;friend&#x27; concept into its two component pieces of subscription and access.

===Abuse Prevention Team decisions===
As LiveJournal has grown, it has had to deal with issues involving the content it hosts. Like most web logging hosts, it has adopted a basic Terms of Service. The Terms of Service simultaneously expresses a desire for free speech by the users while outlining impermissible conduct such as spamming, copyright violation, and harassment. LiveJournal created an Abuse Prevention Team and processes to handle claims about violations of the Terms of Service, violations of copyright, violations of the law, and other issues. There is an ability for a user to report an entry as &quot;spam&quot;, and it is a user&#x27;s responsibility to separate spamming and bot activity from actual violations while reporting.

If the Abuse Prevention Team determines that a violation has occurred, the user will be either required to remove the infringing material (as in the case of copyright violations); the journal will be suspended until such time as the material can be removed (e.g., posting of home addresses or other various contact information of another); or, in cases of severe or multiple violations, the journal will be suspended (e.g., account hijacking, multiple instances of copyright violation, child pornography). The offending user is notified by email of any journal suspension or, if any offending material must be removed, the user is given a deadline for its removal. When a journal is suspended, it effectively removes from sight everything the user has written on LiveJournal, including comments in other people&#x27;s journals; however, the user is able to download the material while suspended. Those suspended users who have paid for LiveJournal&#x27;s service do not have payments refunded.

A small controversy arose in November 2004 when a policy document used by the Abuse Prevention Team was leaked to a group of its critics before it was due to be released. The policy document has since been officially released.

Another controversy arose when users complained after an unknown number of users were asked to remove default user pictures containing images of breast feeding that were considered inappropriate as they contained a view of nipples or areolae. The incident attracted the attention of breast feeding advocacy groups such as Pro-Mom who publicized the issue to gain larger media awareness. LiveJournal responded by changing the FAQ on appropriate content for default user pictures. The current FAQ 111 says that nudity is not appropriate in &quot;default&quot; user pictures; the original FAQ 111 said that graphic sexual content was not appropriate. Breastfeeding pictures were not restricted by the original FAQ, and the current FAQ reflects the fact that they are only restricted from use as a default user picture. Breastfeeding pictures are still allowed as user pictures that may be manually chosen while posting but may not be the default.

===Account vulnerabilities===
In January 2006 the site had to make emergency changes to the way the site hosts user accounts due to a web browser-side security vulnerability. The hacker group responsible was later identified as &quot;Bantown&quot;. Approximately 900,000 accounts were at risk.

===LiveJournal and advertisements===
In April 2006, LiveJournal announced it was introducing a new user type that gave free users some of the features available to paid members in exchange for ad sponsorship. This user type was initially called Sponsored+, but was later renamed to Plus.

This announcement was met with a whirlwind of controversy. Between April 2004 and January 2005, one of LiveJournal&#x27;s Social Contract promises stated the site would, &quot;Stay advertisement free.&quot; The Social Contract went on to say, &quot;It may be because it&#x27;s one of our biggest pet peeves, or it may be because they don&#x27;t garner a lot of money, but nonetheless, we promise to never offer advertising space in our service or on our pages.&quot;

Another ad-related controversy occurred in June 2006, when ads for Kpremium began installing malware and triggering pop-up ads on Australian and Western European users&#x27; computers, against the LiveJournal ad guidelines. LiveJournal responded by removing the advertisement from the website and issuing an apology to its users.

In March 2008, LiveJournal discontinued the ability for new users to select the &quot;basic&quot; level of journal, which allowed for a minimal set of features with no advertising at no cost. However, in August of the same year, the company reversed the decision, reviving &quot;basic&quot; service as a manual, post-registration downgrade. However, the resumed basic service level is no longer ad-free: advertisements are displayed when readers who are not logged into livejournal view postings on a basic account.

Advertisement in LiveJournal is based on the user&#x27;s preferable categories, gender, age, location, interests, or a small portion of public page contents. Ads are targeted according to information about the author, the viewer, and LiveJournal&#x27;s ad preferences as a whole. Users can choose the preferences in their settings among five or more categories of advertising, including Art &amp; Humanities, Cars &amp; Wheels, Books &amp; Reading, Charities, Home &amp; Hobbies, Housing, Internet &amp; Media etc.
It is not possible to completely remove the advertisement other than by upgrading to a Paid Account.

As part of changes made in April 2017, Livejournal eliminated the ability of paid contributors to prevent ads being shown to their readers. Instead, LiveJournal began showing ads on all pages, including postings by paid contributors, unless the reader of the page was also a logged-in paid contributor.

===Account suspension ===
In May 2007, LiveJournal suspended approximately 500 accounts and communities, causing what CNET referred to as a &quot;revolt&quot; from &quot;thousands of LiveJournal customers&quot;, after a number of activist groups, including one named Warriors for Innocence, reported pedophilic material on its website.

According to Six Apart chairman and chief executive Barak Berkowitz, &quot;We did a review of our policies related to how we review those sites, those journals, and came up with the fact that we actually did have a number of journals up that we didn&#x27;t think met our policies and didn&#x27;t think they were appropriate to have up&quot;. In a subsequent posting to the LiveJournal news community, he apologized, discussed some of the circumstances behind the suspensions, and indicated that the suspended journals would be reviewed and potentially brought back online. In particular, he noted that Livejournal&#x27;s normal practice of reviewing suspensions and notifying suspended account holders had not been followed:
[T]hese journals were suspended for easily correctable problems [...] [T]his was not communicated to the journal or community owners at all.
[T]hese journals were taken down before review could be completed to avoid mistakes.

Most of the backlash was from fan fiction writers whose communities and personal journals were among those suspended, seemingly because they listed interests such as &quot;incest&quot; or &quot;non-con&quot; (short for non-consensual). Although these communities did not necessarily encourage illegal behavior, it has been reported that there was no further investigation into the content of these journals.

Beyond merely fan communities, many were initially upset that communities entirely unrelated to anything but the discussion, sometimes therapeutic and other times literary, of rape or child molestation were among those suspended.

On May 31, 2007, Berkowitz released a statement to the LiveJournal news community announcing that Six Apart was currently in the process of unsuspending about half of suspended journals. The journals being reinstated fell into fandom or fiction categories or were journals that were suspended for problems related only to the contents of their profiles. In an earlier interview with news.com, he had stated that he would be &quot;shocked&quot; if &quot;more than a dozen&quot; journals would be reinstated.

On July 19, 2007, Abe Hassan at LiveJournal released a statement clarifying LiveJournal&#x27;s suspension policies. A further statement was made on August 7, 2007.

===Advisory board election===
As previously announced, SUP Media, the latest owners of LiveJournal, decided to create an advisory board to help it make decisions. The first members were distinguished people in the areas of law and technology, danah boyd, Esther Dyson, Lawrence Lessig, and the original LiveJournal founder, Brad Fitzpatrick. SUP announced two other members would be appointed from the LiveJournal userbase, one Russian and one English speaking. The English speaking election was marred with accusations of ballot stuffing, conflicts of interest, and multiple death threats. The developer who wrote the poll software running the election called the ballot stuffing plausible.

===Distributed denial-of-service attacks===
LiveJournal was the victim of several DDoS attacks in 2011. The first attack on March 30 took down the site for several hours. The attack is reported to be the largest DDoS attack against LiveJournal since the site&#x27;s creation. A second attack continued through April 4 and 5, causing service disruption for some users. A third attack in July caused the site to be unavailable for several hours at a time for a week. On December 2, 2011, another attack was recorded, with LiveJournal&#x27;s status blog acknowledging it as such. Of the attacks, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev commented in April 2011 that &quot;what has occurred should be examined by LiveJournal&#x27;s administration and law enforcement agencies.&quot;

On Russia&#x27;s election day in December 2011, LiveJournal saw another attack.

===Presumed database breach===
In October 2018, Troy Hunt, creator of the Have I Been Pwned? site, tweeted that he was getting multiple independent reports that email addresses and passwords from the LiveJournal user database were being used in a scam email campaign.

In May 2020, admins at Dreamwidth reported that they had repeatedly warned LiveJournal of an apparent breach with exposure of LiveJournal passwords, dating back to 2017 or 2014, but that LiveJournal had declined to disclose this to their users.

This information was also passed on to (or somehow otherwise received by) the MyIDCare website (url=https://opm.myidcare.com), a site that was created in 2015 for Federal employees or retirees, who were given free lifetime monitoring to this service by the Office of Personnel Management (the &quot;opm&quot; in the URL), an agency of the Federal Government, after the personal information of millions of people was compromised in a major data breach involving approximately 21,500,000 records in that year (which was made even more serious by the fact that some of the compromised data included information such as fingerprints, which helped this breach gain national attention. The MyIDCare site sent out an alert (dated May 22, 2020) to their previously registered users about a potential data breach at LiveJournal and requested that users change their passwords to protect those accounts against potentially fraudulent activity.

==Legal cases and censorship==
===Lawsuits against bloggers===
In 2007, Russian blogger Savva Terentyev was accused of fomenting social hatred to the staff of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and sentenced to one year probation due to his comment in the blog of a local journalist.
Later another number of individuals were accused of calling for extremist activity, libel and incitement of interethnic hatred.

===LiveJournal blocking===
In May 2007, the Chinese government began blocking LiveJournal. According to SixApart, there were 8,692 self-reported Chinese bloggers on the site.

In October 2010, LiveJournal was blocked in Kazakhstan by court order due to blogs containing extremist content. In March 2012, Uzbekistan began blocking LiveJournal. Although the home page and many of the advertised articles remained accessible, blogs contributed by certain well-known authors couldn&#x27;t be accessed from Uzbekistan.

=== Russian jurisdiction ===
On April 4, 2017, LiveJournal significantly modified its terms of use, making the service subject to Russian law. The new terms prohibit users from posting &quot;advertising and/or political solicitation materials&quot; or performing any actions &quot;contradictory to the laws of the Russian Federation&quot;. The terms also state that users are subject to Article 10.2 of the Federal Act of the Russian Federation No. 149, which dictates that blogs with more than 3,000 daily visitors are classified as media outlets and may not be published anonymously, are responsible for the dissemination of unverified information, and are restricted from posting pornography, obscene language, or &quot;extremist materials&quot;. Western media have described these laws as &quot;draconian&quot; and restricting free expression.

Additionally, only the Russian-language version of the terms of service are considered legally binding. The new terms prompted wide concern from users who believed that their content would now be targeted under Russian censorship policies, including the country&#x27;s &quot;gay propaganda&quot; law. This prompted an &quot;exodus&quot; to alternate platforms of groups who either support LGBT rights or wished to continue discussing those topics.

==Other sites running the LiveJournal engine==
The software running LiveJournal is primarily written in Perl. It was open source software under the GNU General Public License until 2014, when LiveJournal closed their official source code repository to the public; the license continues to apply to the old code from before this change. Because it was open source software, many other communities have been designed using the LiveJournal software or code forks of it, with features and formats similar to LiveJournal itself, including Dreamwidth, InsaneJournal, DeadJournal and GreatestJournal (defunct). However, they often have different terms of service than LiveJournal&#x27;s, making them attractive to users who have become disenchanted with LiveJournal&#x27;s rules and wish to move their journals to other hosts.

<doc id="92408" wikidata="Q485176" url="?curid=92408" title="Pasadena, California">
<text>Pasadena ( ) is a city in Los Angeles County, California, United States, northeast of downtown Los Angeles. It is the most populous city and the primary cultural center of the San Gabriel Valley. Old Pasadena is the city&#x27;s original commercial district.

Its population was 138,699 at the 2020 census, making it the 45th largest city in California and the ninth-largest city in Los Angeles County. Pasadena was incorporated on June 19, 1886, becoming one of the first cities to be incorporated in what is now Los Angeles County, following the city of Los Angeles (April 4, 1850).

Pasadena is known for hosting the annual Rose Bowl football game and Tournament of Roses Parade, major events that take place on New Year&#x27;s Day each year. It is also home to many scientific, educational, and cultural institutions, including the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena City College, Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine, Fuller Theological Seminary, Theosophical Society, Parsons Corporation, Art Center College of Design, the Planetary Society, Pasadena Playhouse, the Ambassador Auditorium, the Norton Simon Museum, and the USC Pacific Asia Museum.

==History==
===Indigenous history===
The earliest known inhabitants of Pasadena and its surroundings were members of the Native American Hahamog-na tribe, a branch of the Tongva Nation. They spoke the Tongva language, part of the Uto-Aztecan language group. Native Americans had lived in the Los Angeles Basin for thousands of years.

Pasadena means &quot;valley&quot; in the language of the Ojibwe, a Native American tribe not local to the region. The name was chosen by American colonists from Indiana who would later move to the area.

===Spanish era===
The Spanish first colonized the Los Angeles Basin in the 1770s as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, building the San Gabriel Mission and renaming the local Tongva people &quot;Gabrielino Indians&quot;, after the name of the mission. Today, several bands of Tongva people live in the Los Angeles area.

===Mexican era===
In 1821, Mexico became independent of Spain, and California came under control of the Mexican government. In 1833, the mission lands were secularized and most of the lands in California were granted to private Mexican citizens in the form of ranchos. Present-day Pasadena was divided between Rancho San Rafael (lands west of the Arroyo Seco extending to present-day Burbank in the northwest to Glassell Park in the southwest), Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual, (present-day central Pasadena, Altadena, and South Pasadena), and Rancho Santa Anita (present-day east Pasadena, Arcadia, and Monrovia). Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual was so named because it was deeded on Easter Sunday to Eulalia Perez de Guillén Mariné of Mission San Gabriel Arcángel.

===American era===
The last of the Mexican owners of Rancho del Rincon de San Pascual was Manuel Garfias, who retained title to the property through the American conquest of California in 1848 and statehood in 1850. Garfias sold sections of the property to the first Anglo settlers to come into the area: Dr. Benjamin Eaton, the father of Fred Eaton; and Dr. S. Griffin. Much of the property was purchased by Benjamin Wilson, who established his Lake Vineyard property in the vicinity. Wilson, known as Don Benito to the local Indians, also owned the Rancho Jurupa (Riverside, California) and was mayor of Los Angeles. He was the grandfather of WWII General George S. Patton, Jr. and the namesake of Mount Wilson.

In 1873, Wilson was visited by Dr. Daniel M. Berry of Indiana, who was looking for a place in the country that could offer a mild climate for his patients, most of whom suffered from respiratory ailments. Berry, an asthmatic, concluded that he had his best three nights&#x27; sleep at Rancho San Pascual. To keep the find a secret, Berry code-named the area &quot;Muscat&quot; after the grape that Wilson grew. To raise funds to bring the company of people to San Pascual, Berry formed the Southern California Orange and Citrus Growers Association and sold stock in it. The newcomers were able to purchase a large portion of the property along the Arroyo Seco and on January 31, 1874, they incorporated the Indiana Colony. As a gesture of good will, Wilson added of then-useless highland property, part of which would become Altadena. Colonel Jabez Banbury opened the first school on South Orange Grove Avenue. Banbury had twin daughters, named Jennie and Jessie. The two became the first students to attend Pasadena&#x27;s first school on Orange Grove.

At the time, the Indiana Colony was a narrow strip of land between the Arroyo Seco and Fair Oaks Avenue. On the other side of the street was Wilson&#x27;s Lake Vineyard development. After more than a decade of parallel development on both sides, the two settlements merged into the City of Pasadena.

===Resort town===

The region drew people from across the country. In 1887, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway opened its Second District and began making stops at the Santa Fe Depot in downtown Pasadena. This triggered a real estate boom. Tourist hotels were developed in the city. Pasadena became a winter resort for wealthy Easterners, spurring the development of new neighborhoods and business districts, and increased road and transit connections with Los Angeles. In 1940, when the Arroyo Seco Parkway, California&#x27;s first freeway, connected Pasadena to Downtown Los Angeles. By that time, Pasadena had become the eighth-largest city in California and was widely considered a twin city to Los Angeles.

The first of the hotels to be established in Pasadena was the Raymond (1886) atop Bacon Hill, renamed Raymond Hill after construction. The original Mansard Victorian 200-room facility burned down on Easter morning of 1895, was rebuilt in 1903, and razed during the Great Depression to make way for residential development. The Maryland Hotel existed from the early 1900s and was demolished in 1934. The world-famous Mount Lowe Railway and associated mountain hotels shut down four years later due to fire damage. Three hotel structures have survived, the Green Hotel (a co-op since 1926), the Vista Del Arroyo (now used as a Federal courthouse), and a residential tower of the Maryland at 80 North Euclid Avenue (a co-op since 1953).

The American Craftsman era in art and design is well represented in Pasadena. The architectural firm Greene and Greene developed the style; many of its residences still stand. Two examples of their Ultimate bungalow are the masterpiece Gamble House, of which public tours are available, and the Robert R. Blacker House, both designated California Historical Landmarks and enrolled on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

===Contemporary===

The Second World War proved to be a boon to Pasadena as Southern California became a major staging area for the Pacific War. High tech manufacturing and scientific companies made the city their home, a trend which continued in the decades following the war, notably with NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Tetra Tech and Ameron International.

In the 1950s, Pasadena saw a steady influx of people from the Southern United States, especially African-Americans from Texas and Louisiana. Pasadena also began hosting a large immigrant community, particularly from China, Japan, Philippines, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Italy, Armenia, and India.

The American Academy of Dramatic Arts, founded in 1884 in New York, opened its Pasadena campus in 1974. However, in 2001 the conservatory moved from Pasadena to Hollywood. Training actors for the stage in a two year program, the conservatory was the first school in the United States to offer professional education in the field of acting. Point Loma Nazarene University was located in Pasadena for many years before relocating to San Diego County, and retained the names Pasadena University and Pasadena College.

In 1969, the Pasadena Unified School District was desegregated, though the issue would continue to be fought in court for a decade. A year later, the 210 Freeway was built along a newly chosen route. The freeway&#x27;s construction was controversial, as it caused the demolition of over a thousand homes, many historic, and many claimed that the route was designed to cut off the city&#x27;s less wealthy neighborhoods.

Downtown Pasadena became dangerous in some parts and deserted in others, and incidences of murder and arson skyrocketed. Old Pasadena faced destruction as plans for new high-rise developments were drawn up, though they were mostly stopped by increasingly active preservation advocates. Pasadena suffered demographically as many residents moved for the nearby suburbs or the Inland Empire, causing an overall decrease in population. Despite these setbacks, many local artists and hipsters moved in to take advantage of low property values. Their legacy can be seen today in the Doo Dah Parade which began in 1976.

In 2014, several arrests were made involving an embezzlement scheme which stole an estimated $6.4 million from the city&#x27;s Underground Utility Program.

In January 2025, portions of Pasadena were destroyed in the Eaton Fire.

==Geography==

The greater Pasadena area is bounded by the Raymond Fault line, the San Rafael Hills, and the San Gabriel Mountains. The Arroyo Seco, a major geographic feature and home of the Rose Bowl, flows from headwaters in Pasadena&#x27;s towering Angeles National Forest greenbelt in the San Gabriel Mountains. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 99% of it land; 0.68% is water.

===Climate===

Pasadena has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;), with typically hotter summers and slightly cooler winters than nearby coastal areas. Its location relative to the San Gabriel mountains allows the orographic lift to add several more inches of rainfall per year than nearby areas. During the first few months of the year, Pasadena experiences cool to warm highs, typically in the upper 60s () to lower 70s (). Colder days are usually accompanied by heavier rain. By April, temperatures warm further, and rain tapers off significantly.

By May and June, rain is typically sparse, but the marine layer becomes more persistent. Locals have dubbed June &quot;June Gloom&quot; as it is the cloudiest month despite being the 3rd driest month. By July, the marine layer subsides as inland areas cool due to an increased monsoon flow. Heatwaves from July through October can be oppressive and lengthy. In addition, it rarely rains during the summer and fall months, and only does when the remnants of hurricanes and tropical storms pass by. In fact, some days in both July and August have never recorded rainfall. It is not impossible to go 6 months without measurable precipitation.

The average highest temperature recorded each year is around . The hottest heatwaves of the year usually occur in mid to late September. By late October, temperatures drop off. By November, Pacific storms return to Pasadena, bringing increasingly heavy rain and cooler weather. Along with them, however, are the Santa Ana winds. The Santa Ana winds can produce heat, high winds, power outages, tree damage and an increased wildfire threat whenever they strike. By December, lows typically drop into the 40s (below 10 °C) with the occasional reading in the 30s (under 5 °C and down to freezing). Highs remain around with heatwaves pushing temperatures into the mid-80s (around 30 °C). A high temperature of at least has been recorded on all 365 days of the year, with temperatures over possible April through early November.
Pasadena averages of rain a year, about more than nearby Los Angeles due to the orographic effect created by the San Gabriel Mountains. The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; was from July 1940 to June 1941 with and the driest from July 1960 to June 1961 with . Wet years are commonly associated with El Niño warm surface water in the eastern Pacific and dry years with La Niña cold water conditions. The most rainfall in one month was in February 1980. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on March 2, 1938.

Situated at the base of the San Gabriel Mountains, snow is known to fall occasionally in Pasadena. The heaviest snowfall in Pasadena history occurred on January 11, 1949; fell at Pasadena&#x27;s city hall and more than fell in the foothills above the city. The most recent snowfall in Pasadena was on February 21, 2019.

On November 30 and December 1, 2011, Pasadena, along with surrounding communities, was struck by a major windstorm caused by Santa Ana winds. The city suffered heavy damage with trees toppled, buildings damaged and even the roof of a gas station torn off.

The official NOAA weather station for the city is located just north-west of the townhall on the other side of Garfield Avenue.

==Economy==

Old Town Pasadena spans 21 blocks downtown. It boasts shops and a wide variety of restaurants, nightclubs, outdoor cafés, pubs, and comedy clubs. &quot;One Colorado&quot; features renovated historic architecture that attracted the new retail stores and restaurants. This development filled vacant buildings and was the impetus of the revitalization of Old Town on Colorado Boulevard.

Paseo Colorado is an open-air mall that covers three city blocks, anchored on the west end by upscale grocery store Gelson&#x27;s (recently closed), on the east end by Macy&#x27;s (also closed) and Regal Cinemas centers the middle portion of the mall. Another shopping district is located in the South Lake Avenue neighborhood. On Lake Avenue, a Macy&#x27;s department store and furniture gallery is in a registered California historical landmark. The building was originally designed and built as the fourth Bullock&#x27;s department store in the mid-1950s (the last freestanding store they constructed).

The Rose Bowl Flea Market is a large swap meet that involves thousands of dealers and tens of thousands of visitors in and around the grounds of the Rose Bowl. The merchandise on display ranges from old world antiques to California pottery to vintage clothing. The flea market has been held every second Sunday of the month since 1967.

===Top employers===
According to the City&#x27;s 2023 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Other companies based in Pasadena include Idealab, Inter-Con Security, Green Dot Corporation, Tetra Tech, Wesco Financial, OpenX, Stark Spirits Distillery, and Wetzel&#x27;s Pretzels. The Los Angeles office of China Eastern Airlines is also located in Pasadena.

==Arts and culture==
===Tournament of Roses Parade===
Pasadena is home to the Tournament of Roses Parade, held each year on January 1 (or on January 2, if the 1st falls on a Sunday). The first parade was held in 1890 and was originally sponsored by the Valley Hunt Club, a Pasadena social club. The motivation for having the parade was, as member Professor Charles F. Holder said, &quot;In New York, people are buried in snow. Here our flowers are blooming and our oranges are about to bear. Let&#x27;s hold a festival to tell the world about our paradise.&quot;

By 1895, the festivities had outgrown the Valley Hunt Club, and the Tournament of Roses Association was formed to take charge of the parade. The Rose Parade, as it is familiarly known, traditionally features elaborate floats, bands and equestrian units. According to the organizers, &quot;Every inch of every float must be covered with flowers, or other natural materials, such as leaves, seeds, or bark. On average a float requires about 100,000 flowers and greenery. Volunteer workers swarm over the floats in the days after Christmas, their hands and clothes covered with glue and petals.&quot; The most perishable flowers are placed in small vials of water, which are placed onto the float individually. Over the almost 3 hours of the parade, floats, and participants travel over and pass by over one million viewers who traditionally camp out over New Year&#x27;s Eve to have the best view along the parade route.

The Rose Parade is satirized by the popular Doo Dah Parade, an annual event that originated in Old Pasadena in 1978, and soon gained national notoriety. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; named the Doo Dah Parade &quot;America&#x27;s Best Parade&quot;, and was a recent feature in &quot;50 Places You Must Visit Before You Die!&quot;. It was formerly held around Thanksgiving, a month before the Rose Parade, but the parade is now held in January. In 2011, after 33 years in Pasadena, the parade moved to East Pasadena for the first time. It features unusual and absurd entrants such as the BBQ &amp; Hibachi Marching Grill Team, the Men of Leisure, and the Bastard Sons of Lee Marvin. Proceeds from the parade&#x27;s pancake breakfast, T-shirts, and after-party are donated to charity.

The Tournament of Roses also auditions local female high school students to be part of the Rose Court. There are total 7 candidates that advances to the Rose Court and one is chosen to be the Rose Queen and the others to be the Rose Princess. The Rose Court&#x27;s main goal is to support local communities and local stores. They visit small stores owned by local residents to boost the activity of the area and to keep them in the current flow of the economics.

During the Rose Parade, the Rose Court members are also on a float, going through the parade together with the line of parades. The Rose Courts also represent their own local communities and their high school that they attend.

===Rose Bowl Game===

The Rose Bowl, a National Historic Landmark, is host of the first and most famous college football postseason bowl game, the Tournament of Roses Rose Bowl Game, every New Year&#x27;s Day. In 1895, the Tournament of Roses Association was formed to take charge of the parade. In 1902, the association declared that a football game would be added to the day&#x27;s events. This was the first post-season college football game to be played on New Year&#x27;s Day and is known as, &quot;The Grandaddy of Them All&quot;; many other football stadiums followed suit. After two decades, the game outgrew its original facility, and a new stadium was constructed in the Arroyo Seco area. The new stadium hosted its first New Year&#x27;s Day football game in 1923. It was soon christened &quot;The Rose Bowl&quot;, as was the game itself.

The Rose Bowl, also holds annual Fourth of July events in its stadium. Due to fireworks being banned or illegal, people gather together at the Rose Bowl to watch the night sky light up with colorful fireworks.

===Performing arts===

The legendary Pasadena Playhouse, the State Theater of California, is a member supported theater company that celebrated their centennial season in 2018. The theater puts on five shows a year. In 1937, the Pasadena Playhouse established a record as the only theatre in the United States to have staged the entire Shakespearean canon. Today, the Playhouse is known for their innovative productions.

The Pasadena Symphony, founded in 1928, offers several concerts a year at the Ambassador Auditorium and the Pasadena Pops plays at the Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden. The Civic Center also holds a few traveling Broadway shows each year.

Beckman Auditorium and other venues on the Caltech campus present a wide range of performing arts, lectures, films, classes and entertainment events, primarily during the academic year.

For more than ten years, twice annually Pasadena&#x27;s cultural institutions have opened their doors for free during ArtNight Pasadena, offering the public a rich sampling of quality art, artifacts and music within the city. This has evolved into the yearly PasadenART Weekend, a three-day citywide event which, as of 2007, encompasses ArtNight, ArtWalk, ArtHeritage, ArtMarket, and ArtPerformance, a vibrant outdoor music event showcasing emerging and nationally recognized talent. Free concerts take place on multiple stages throughout Old Pasadena.

Ambassador Auditorium was built under the guidance of Herbert W. Armstrong as both a facility to be used by the Worldwide Church of God for religious services and as a concert hall for public performances celebrating the performing arts. In 2007, the native Pasadena band Ozma reunited and produced the album &quot;Pasadena&quot; in tribute to the city. The album photos and artwork were shot at the Colorado Street Bridge.

The 1960s song &quot;The Little Old Lady from Pasadena&quot; parodies a popular Southern California image of Pasadena as home to a large population of aged eccentrics. In the song, Jan and Dean sing of an elderly lady who drives a powerful &quot;Super Stock Dodge&quot; muscle car and is &quot;the terror of Colorado Boulevard&quot;. The Dead Kennedys paid a tribute to this archetypal song in the track &quot;Buzzbomb From Pasadena&quot; in the album &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot;. Pasadena was also the location of the 2012 film Project X.

===Visual arts===
A number of artists of national repute, such as Guy Rose, Alson S. Clark, Marion Wachtel and Ernest A. Batchelder, of the Arts and Crafts Movement, made Pasadena their home in the early twentieth century. The formation of the California Art Club, Stickney Memorial Art School (later known as Pasadena Arts Institute) and the Pasadena Society of Artists heralded the city&#x27;s emergence as a regional center for the visual arts.

===Museums and galleries===

Pasadena is home to a number of art museums and public galleries, including the Norton Simon Museum. The museum&#x27;s collections include European paintings, sculpture, and tapestry; sculpture from Southern Asia; and an extensive sculpture garden. The museum also has the contemporary art collection of its predecessor, the Pasadena Museum of Art, which focused on modern and contemporary art before being taken over by Simon in the early 1970s.

Preserving and sharing the rich history and culture of Pasadena and its adjacent communities is the Pasadena Museum of History. Located on a campus of , it has gardens, a history center, the Finnish Folk Art Museum, the Curtin House, and the Fenyes Mansion, a 1906 Beaux Arts-style architectural residence and a Pasadena Cultural Heritage Landmark.

In 2002 David Ebershoff published the novel &quot;Pasadena&quot;. The novel won praise for its accurate recreation of Pasadena before World War II.

===Bungalow Heaven===

Bungalow Heaven is a neighborhood of 800 small Craftsman homes built from 1900 to 1930. Many of these homes are still occupied. Much of the area became a landmark district in 1989, and annual historic home tours have been conducted since that designation. Bungalow Heaven&#x27;s borders are Washington Boulevard to the north, Orange Grove Boulevard to the south, Mentor Avenue to the west, and Chester Avenue to the east. The neighborhood is usually extended to Lake Avenue to the west and Hill Avenue to the east.
Famed architects Greene and Greene built several of their Japanese-inspired bungalows in Pasadena, including the Gamble House; the style of the homes in Bungalow Heaven show the effects of their success.

===Orange Grove Boulevard===
The Norton Simon Museum is at the intersection of Orange Grove and Colorado Boulevards. This corner is the official start of the Rose Parade route and the museum can be quite clearly seen every year during the parade television broadcast.

Orange Grove Boulevard is one of several exclusive residential districts in Pasadena, and has been a home for the rich and famous since the early 20th century. Because of the number of landmark mansions, the street earned the name Millionaire&#x27;s Row, an appropriate sobriquet considering that the estates that once lined this spacious boulevard and the surrounding neighborhood read like a Who&#x27;s Who of American consumer products.

===Historical estates===
The maker of Wrigley&#x27;s chewing gum, William Wrigley Jr.&#x27;s, substantial home was offered to the city of Pasadena after Mrs. Wrigley&#x27;s death in 1958, under the condition that their home would be the Rose Parade&#x27;s permanent headquarters. The stately Tournament House stands today, and serves as the headquarters for the Tournament of Roses Parade. Adolphus Busch, co-founder of Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser beer, established the first of a series of Busch Gardens in Pasadena. When Busch died at his Pasadena estate, his wife generously offered the property to the City of Pasadena, an offer the city inexplicably refused. Henry Markham, who lived adjacent to Busch, was the 18th Governor of the state of California (1891–1895) and wrote &quot;Pasadena: Its Early Years&quot;. The home of David Gamble, son of consumer product maker James Gamble of Procter &amp; Gamble, is located on the north end of Orange Grove Boulevard.

The Gamble House, an American Craftsman masterpiece, was built in 1908, by architects Charles and Henry Greene, as an exemplification of their ultimate bungalow. It is open to the public as both an architectural conservancy and museum.

The Gamble House is a California Historical Landmark and a National Historic Landmark on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1966, it was deeded to the city of Pasadena in a mutual agreement with the University of Southern California School of Architecture. Every year, two fifth-year USC architecture students live in the house full-time. The students change yearly.

The home of Anna Bissell McCay, daughter of carpet sweeper magnate Melville Bissell, is a four-story Victorian home, on the border of South Pasadena. Today the Bissell House is a bed and breakfast. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe&#x27;s home of was on South Orange Grove. The house included a sixth story solarium which he converted into an observatory. Lowe was also a generous patron of the astronomical sciences. He started a water-gas company, founded the Citizens Bank of Los Angeles, built numerous ice plants, and purchased a Pasadena opera house. He also established the Mount Lowe Railway in the mountains above Pasadena and eventually lost his fortune. The brilliant, but troubled, rocket scientist John Whiteside Parsons sometimes shared his residence with other noteworthy people, including L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. Parsons died in an explosion while testing a new rocket fuel in his Pasadena home laboratory, in 1952.

===Rose Bowl Stadium===

In addition to the annual New Year&#x27;s Day Rose Bowl game and a College Football Playoff semi-final game every three years, the stadium is the home field for the UCLA Bruins football team and has hosted five Super Bowls and many BCS National Championship games. Important soccer games include the 1984 Summer Olympics, the final game of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and the final game of the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup.

The Rose Bowl stadium was the home ground for the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer from the team&#x27;s inception in 1996 until in 2003, it moved into the soccer-specific Home Depot Center (now Dignity Health Sports Park) in Carson, California. The venue additionally hosted the 1998 MLS Cup. Many concerts and other events have been held in the stadium, such as Beyonce and Jay Z&#x27;s &quot;On the Run Tour&quot; on August 2, 2014.

===Aquatic center===
The Rose Bowl Aquatics Center sits next to the Rose Bowl Stadium. The pool hosted the final practices of the 2000 US Olympic swimming and diving team. In 2008, the facility held the U.S. National Diving Championships.

In 2016, the Pasadena Public Health Department received accreditation by the national Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB). The city is primarily served by Huntington Hospital, located adjacent to the downtown area. The eastern half of the city was formerly served by St. Luke Medical Center until its closure in 2002. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services operates the Monrovia Health Center in Monrovia, serving portions of Pasadena.

ABC&#x27;s TV show &quot;Splash&quot; was filmed at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center.

===Radio===
Pasadena has been home to a number of notable radio stations. In 1967 radio iconoclasts Tom and Raechel Donahue took over an aging studio in the basement of the Pasadena Presbyterian Church and introduced Los Angeles to FM freeform radio. Broadcasting under the KPPC-FM call sign at 106.7 FM it quickly became the voice of the counterculture and provided the soundtrack to LA&#x27;s hippie era. Early on-air personalities included Michael McKean, David Lander, Harry Shearer, and Dr. Demento. The staff was fired en masse in 1971 and the station lost its distinctive personality. KPPC later became KROQ-FM, which is owned by Entercom.

Today the primary radio station in Pasadena goes by the call sign KPCC located at 89.3 FM. Broadcasting from the Mohn Broadcast Center on South Raymond Avenue (and no longer on the Pasadena City College campus), this public radio station carries many shows from National Public Radio but maintains an independent streak, committing a large chunk of air time to presenting local and state news. Accordingly, the station has received numerous awards for journalistic excellence and continues to be an important part of the city&#x27;s heritage. WilsonBlock100 Radio conducts audio interviews with local artists and covers events related to the local music scene. Their name derives from Wilson Ave. in Pasadena&#x27;s Bungalow Heaven neighborhood district.

===Newspapers and magazines===
Pasadena&#x27;s largest and oldest newspaper is the &quot;Pasadena Star-News&quot;, first published in 1884. The daily newspaper also publishes the &quot;Rose Magazine&quot;. &quot;The Pasadena Journal&quot; a community weekly featuring the Black voices of the San Gabriel Valley since 1989. &quot;Pasadena Now&quot; is a community news website covering stories in the community since 2004. &quot;Pasadena Weekly&quot;, an alternative weekly, has been published since 1984. &quot;Colorado Boulevard .net&quot; grassroots news website was launched in 2013 and covers both the Pasadena and Alhambra areas with stories written by residents of the communities instead of professional journalists. &quot;Pasadena Outlook&quot; covers news from non-profit organizations, social event, private K-12 school and private high school sports coverage. It was launched in 2007.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Public transit====

Pasadena is served by the Los Angeles Metro A Line light rail, which originates at the Downtown Long Beach station in Long Beach and APU/Citrus College station in Azusa. Opening in 2003 as the Gold Line, there are six A Line stations in Pasadena: Fillmore, Del Mar, and Memorial Park stations in Old Pasadena, Lake station in Downtown, Allen and Sierra Madre Villa stations. Construction began in June 2010 to extend the Gold Line east through several additional foothill communities of the San Gabriel Valley, including Arcadia, Monrovia, Duarte, Irwindale, and Azusa. It began revenue service on March 5, 2016.

Pasadena is also served by various bus services. Pasadena Transit exclusively serves the city, while bus services Amtrak Thruway 19, Foothill Transit, LADOT Commuter Express , Metro Local, and Metro Express also serve Pasadena.

====Trains====

Pasadena was served by the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, which was acquired by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway in 1906, at a Santa Fe Depot in downtown when the Second District was opened in 1887. In 1925, the historical and traditionally styled station in Pasadena was opened. Originally, the Second District was an invaluable line; it served manufacturing and agricultural businesses throughout the entire San Gabriel Valley. But longer trains had great difficulty climbing the precipitous 2.2% grade at Arroyo Seco, between Pasadena and Los Angeles, requiring the costly addition of extra locomotives. The still-used Third District opened in 1888, just a year after the Second District, and rapidly took over most of the longer freight trains.

The Second District and the Pasadena Depot became well known; up to 26 passenger trains went through Pasadena every day. To avoid the media in Los Angeles, many celebrities chose to use Pasadena as their main train station, bringing it an association with old Hollywood.

Amtrak took over passenger rail operations in 1971, serving Pasadena with trains such as the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;, &quot;Las Vegas Limited&quot;, and &quot;Desert Wind&quot;. On January 15, 1994, the final &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; train arrived in Pasadena. ATSF sold the line between Los Angeles and San Bernardino via Pasadena (known as the &quot;second division&quot;) following the 1994 Northridge earthquake which damaged a bridge in Arcadia used by the line. (Now the &quot;Southwest Chief&quot; operates over the transcon via Fullerton.) The LACMTA A Line uses the right-of-way after rebuilding the route to accommodate light rail in 2003. The old depot is still visible at the Del Mar station, though it has since been converted into a restaurant. Electrified Light Rail was the preferred alternative to Metrolink or similar style rail service due to the city of Pasadena voting against any further diesel locomotives traversing through the city. The construction of the Gold Line also allowed the closure of the former railroad crossing along Colorado Boulevard which meant that motorists and the Rose Parade would no longer be hindered by trains.

====Airports====
Hollywood Burbank Airport in nearby Burbank serves as the regional airport for Pasadena. The airport is owned and operated by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. The airport is under the control of the governments of the three cities named. While most destinations from Hollywood Burbank Airport are within the United States, Los Angeles International Airport and Ontario International Airport are the major airports that provide domestic and international commercial service. Other nearby airports with commercial service include Long Beach Airport and John Wayne Airport.

====Freeways and highways====
Four freeways run through Pasadena, and Pasadena is a control city for all of them. The most important is the Foothill Freeway (I-210) which enters the northwestern portion of the city from La Cañada Flintridge. The Foothill Freeway initially runs due south, passing the Rose Bowl before its junction with the Ventura Freeway. At this interchange, the Foothill Freeway shifts its alignment and direction, becoming an east-west freeway, exiting the city on its eastern boundary before entering Arcadia. The Foothill Freeway connects Pasadena with San Fernando (westbound) and San Bernardino (eastbound).
The Ventura Freeway (SR 134) starts at the junction of the Foothill Freeway (I-210) at the edge of downtown Pasadena and travels westward. This freeway is the main connector to the Hollywood Burbank Airport and the San Fernando Valley.

A spur of the Long Beach Freeway (SR 710 in Pasadena) is also located in Pasadena. The Long Beach Freeway was intended to connect Long Beach to Pasadena but a gap, known as the South Pasadena Gap, between Alhambra and Pasadena has not been completed due to legal battles primarily involving the city of South Pasadena. The spur starts at the junction of the Ventura Freeway and Foothill Freeway and travels south along the eastern edge of Old Pasadena with two exits for Colorado Boulevard and Del Mar Boulevard before ending at an at-grade intersection with California Boulevard. Efforts to complete the Long Beach Freeway were met with strong opposition, including the possibility of using advanced tunneling technologies to overcome objections. The gap will no longer be constructed, with the $780 million earmarked for constructing the gap now allocated towards local infrastructure improvements. Pasadena is exploring options on the future of the spur.
The Arroyo Seco Parkway (SR 110), also known as the Pasadena Freeway, was the first freeway in California, connecting Los Angeles with Pasadena alongside the Arroyo Seco and is the primary access to Downtown Los Angeles. The freeway enters the southern part of the city from South Pasadena. Only one exit is actually inside city limits, the southbound exit connecting to State Street with access to Fair Oaks Avenue. At Glenarm Street, the freeway ends and the four-lane Arroyo Parkway continues northward to Old Pasadena.

Three state highways enter the city of Pasadena. Arroyo Parkway (SR 110), maintained by the city of Pasadena, runs from the termination of the Pasadena Freeway at Glenarm Street to Colorado Boulevard in Old Town Pasadena. While Arroyo Parkway continues north two more blocks, SR 110 ends at Holly Street.

Rosemead Boulevard (formerly SR 19) is a state highway in unincorporated Pasadena from Huntington Drive to Foothill Boulevard.

A portion of the Angeles Crest Highway (SR 2) in the San Gabriel Mountains cuts through Pasadena near the Angeles Crest Ranger Station. This stretch of highway in the Angeles National Forest is north of La Cañada Flintridge and west of Mount Wilson and is approximately in elevation.

Historic U.S. Route 66 ran through Pasadena until it was decommissioned in 1964. The historic highway entered Pasadena from the east on Colorado Boulevard and then jogged south on Arroyo Parkway before becoming part of the Pasadena Freeway (SR 110).

The intersection of Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard in Old Pasadena is the zero-zero, east-west, north-south postal division of Pasadena.

===Water and power ===

The city Water and Power Department (PWP) provides services to an area encompassing that includes areas outside of the city proper, including unincorporated areas of southern Altadena, East Pasadena, Chapman Woods, and East San Gabriel. PWP has operated the Glenarm Power Plant for over 110 years.

Pasadena created the Pasadena Municipal Light and Power Department in 1906. Expanding continued and more generating capacity was expanded and the city then offered power to commercial customers in 1908, and bought out Southern California Edison&#x27;s Pasadena operations in 1920. In 1911, the city began condemnation actions against a number of small, local water companies. In 1912, the Water Department was created; in 1913, it began actual operations. The city continued to acquire small, local water companies for several decades afterwards, usually &quot;en toto&quot;, such as the Pasadena Lake Vineyard and Land Company, and sometimes in part, such as Las Flores Water Company&#x27;s southern portions and San Gabriel Valley Water Company&#x27;s operations in the southern reaches of Pasadena. In 1967, the Water Department and the Light and Power department were consolidated into the &quot;Pasadena Water and Power Department&quot; (or PWP).

It operates a number of water wells, has a spreading ground for the capture of surface water from the Arroyo Seco, and purchases surface water from MWDSC. A number of wells on the west side of the service area had become contaminated with volatile organic chemicals and perchlorate and had to be shut down several years. A treatment plant was built to remove these chemicals which began operation in July 2011.

==Wildlife ==
Pasadena has a large, non-indigenous population of naturalized parrots. According to the &quot;Parrot Project of Los Angeles&quot;, the parrots are of at least six species. Some residents have come to enjoy the birds as part of the city&#x27;s unique culture, while others consider them to be loud pests. There are many theories explaining how the parrots came to inhabit Pasadena. A widely accepted story is that they were part of the stock that were set free for their survival from the large pet emporium at Simpson&#x27;s Garden Town on East Colorado Boulevard, which burned down in 1959.

==Sister cities==
Pasadena has six sister cities as noted by Sister Cities International (SCI):
* Ludwigshafen, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany (1948) pre-dates Sister Cities International which was formed in 1956

<doc id="92409" wikidata="Q327298" url="?curid=92409" title="Shigellosis">
<text>Shigellosis, known historically as dysentery, is an infection of the intestines caused by &quot;Shigella&quot; bacteria. Symptoms generally start one to two days after exposure and include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and feeling the need to pass stools even when the bowels are empty. The diarrhea may be bloody. Symptoms typically last five to seven days and it may take several months before bowel habits return entirely to normal. Complications can include reactive arthritis, sepsis, seizures, and hemolytic uremic syndrome.
Shigellosis is caused by four specific types of &quot;Shigella&quot;. These are typically spread by exposure to infected feces. This can occur via contaminated food, water, or hands or sexual contact. Contamination may be spread by flies or when changing diapers (nappies). Diagnosis is by stool culture.
The risk of infection can be reduced by properly washing the hands. There is no vaccine. Shigellosis usually resolves without specific treatment. Rest, and sufficient fluids by mouth, are recommended. Bismuth subsalicylate may help with the symptoms; however, medications that slow the bowels such as loperamide are not recommended. In severe cases antibiotics may be used but resistance is common. Commonly used antibiotics include ciprofloxacin and azithromycin.
A 2005 report by the World Health Organization estimated that shigellosis occurs in at least 80 million people and results in about 700,000 deaths a year globally. Most cases occur in the developing world. Young children are most commonly affected. Outbreaks of disease may occur in childcare settings and schools. It is also relatively common among travelers. In the United States about half a million cases occur a year.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs and symptoms may range from mild abdominal discomfort to severe dysentery characterized by cramps, diarrhea, with slimy-consistent stools, fever, blood, pus, or mucus in stools or tenesmus. Onset time is 12 to 96 hours, and recovery takes 5 to 7 days.
Infections are associated with mucosal ulceration, rectal bleeding, and drastic dehydration. Reactive arthritis and hemolytic uremic syndrome are possible sequelae that have been reported in the aftermath of shigellosis.

The most common neurological symptom includes seizures.

==Cause==
===Bacteria===
Shigellosis is caused by a bacterial infection with &quot;Shigella&quot;, a bacterium that is genetically similar to and was once classified as &quot;E. coli&quot;. There are three serogroups and one serotype of &quot;Shigella&quot;:
* &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot;
* &quot;Shigella boydii&quot;
* &quot;Shigella dysenteriae&quot; and
* &quot;Shigella sonnei&quot; (serotype)

The probability of being infected by any given strain of &quot;Shigella&quot; varies around the world. For instance, &quot;S. sonnei&quot; is the most common in the United States, while &quot;S. dysenteriae&quot; and &quot;S. boydii&quot; are rare there.

=== Transmission ===
&quot;Shigella&quot; is transmitted through the fecal-oral route of individuals infected with the disease, whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms. Long-term carriers of the bacteria are rare. The bacteria can infect not just humans but other primates as well.

==Mechanism==
Upon ingestion, the bacteria pass through the gastrointestinal tract until they reach the small intestine. There they begin to multiply until they reach the large intestine. In the large intestine, the bacteria cause cell injury and the beginning stages of Shigellosis via two main mechanisms: direct invasion of epithelial cells in the large intestine and production of enterotoxin 1 and enterotoxin 2.

Unlike other bacteria, &quot;Shigella&quot; is not destroyed by the gastric acid in the stomach. As a result, it takes only 10 to 200 cells to cause an infection. This infectious dose is several orders of magnitude smaller than that of other species of bacteria (e.g., cholera, caused by the bacterium &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;, has an infectious dose between 108 and 1011 cells).

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis of shigellosis is made by isolating the organism from diarrheal fecal sample cultures. &quot;Shigella&quot; species are negative for motility and are generally not lactose fermenters, but &quot;S. sonnei&quot; can ferment lactose. They typically do not produce gas from carbohydrates (with the exception of certain strains of &quot;S. flexneri&quot;) and tend to be overall biochemically inert. &quot;Shigella&quot; should also be urea hydrolysis negative. When inoculated to a triple sugar iron slant, they react as follows: K/A, gas -, and H2S -. Indole reactions are mixed, positive and negative, with the exception of &quot;S. sonnei&quot;, which is always indole negative. Growth on Hektoen enteric agar produces bluish-green colonies for &quot;Shigella&quot; and bluish-green colonies with black centers for &quot;Salmonella&quot;.

==Prevention==
Simple precautions can be taken to prevent getting shigellosis: wash hands before handling food and thoroughly cook all food before eating. The primary prevention methods are improved sanitation and personal and food hygiene, but a low-cost and efficacious vaccine would complement these methods.

Since shigellosis is spread very quickly among children, keeping infected children out of daycare for 24 hours after their symptoms have disappeared, will decrease the occurrence of shigellosis in daycares.

===Vaccine===
Currently, no licensed vaccine targeting &quot;Shigella&quot; exists. Several vaccine candidates for &quot;Shigella&quot; are in various stages of development including live attenuated, conjugate, ribosomal, and proteosome vaccines. &quot;Shigella&quot; has been a longstanding World Health Organization target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent the disease should be feasible. &quot;Shigella&quot; species are resistant to many antibiotics, so vaccination is an important part of the strategy to reduce morbidity and mortality.

==Treatment==
Treatment consists mainly of replacing fluids and salts lost because of diarrhea. Replacement by mouth is satisfactory for most people, but some may need to receive fluids intravenously. Antidiarrheal drugs (such as diphenoxylate or loperamide) may prolong the infection and should not be used.

===Antibiotics===
Antibiotics should only be used in severe cases or for certain populations with mild symptoms (elderly, immunocompromised, food service industry workers, child care workers). For &quot;Shigella&quot;-associated diarrhea, antibiotics shorten the length of infection, but they are usually avoided in mild cases because many &quot;Shigella&quot; strains are becoming resistant to common antibiotics. Furthermore, effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries, which carry the majority of the disease burden from &quot;Shigella&quot;. Antidiarrheal agents may worsen the sickness, and should be avoided.

In most cases, the disease resolves within four to eight days without antibiotics. Severe infections may last three to six weeks. Antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin may be given when the person is very young or very old, when the disease is severe, or when the risk of the infection spreading to other people is high. Additionally, ampicillin (but not amoxicillin) was effective in treating this disease previously, but now the first choice of drug is pivmecillinam.

==Epidemiology==
Insufficient data exist, but it is estimated to have caused the death of 34,000 children under the age of five in 2013, and 40,000 deaths in people over five years of age. &quot;Shigella&quot; also causes about 580,000 cases annually among travelers and military personnel from industrialized countries.

An estimated 500,000 cases of shigellosis occur annually in the United States. Infants, the elderly, and the critically ill are susceptible to the most severe symptoms of disease, but all humans are susceptible to some degree. Individuals with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are more frequently infected with &quot;Shigella&quot;. Shigellosis is a more common and serious condition in the developing world; fatality rates of shigellosis epidemics in developing countries can be 5–15%.

Orthodox Jewish communities (OJCs) are a known risk group for shigellosis; &quot;Shigella sonnei&quot; is cyclically epidemic in these communities in Israel, with sporadic outbreaks occurring elsewhere among these communities. &quot;Through phylogenetic and genomic analysis, we showed that strains from outbreaks in OJCs outside of Israel are distinct from strains in the general population and relate to a single multidrug-resistant sublineage of &quot;S. sonnei&quot; that prevails in Israel. Further Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed that this strain emerged approximately 30 years ago, demonstrating the speed at which antimicrobial drug–resistant pathogens can spread widely through geographically dispersed, but internationally connected, communities.&quot;

<text>Shigella is a genus of bacteria that is Gram negative, facultatively anaerobic, non–spore-forming, nonmotile, rod shaped, and is genetically nested within &quot;Escherichia&quot;. The genus is named after Kiyoshi Shiga, who discovered it in 1897.

&quot;Shigella&quot; causes disease in primates, but not in other mammals; it is the causative agent of human shigellosis. It is only naturally found in humans and gorillas. During infection, it typically causes dysentery.

&quot;Shigella&quot; is a leading cause of bacterial diarrhea worldwide, with 80–165 million annual cases (estimated) and 74,000 to 600,000 deaths. It is one of the top four pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhea in African and South Asian children.

== Classification ==
&quot;Shigella&quot; species are classified by three serogroups and one serotype:
* Serogroup &quot;A&quot;: &quot;S. dysenteriae&quot; (15 serotypes)
* Serogroup &quot;B&quot;: &quot;S. flexneri&quot; (9 serotypes)
* Serogroup &quot;C&quot;: &quot;S. boydii&quot; (19 serotypes)
* Serogroup &quot;D&quot;: &quot;S. sonnei&quot; (one serotype)

Groups &quot;A&quot;–&quot;C&quot; are physiologically similar; &quot;S. sonnei&quot; (group &quot;D&quot;) can be differentiated based on biochemical metabolism assays. Three &quot;Shigella&quot; groups are the major disease-causing species: &quot;S. flexneri&quot; is the most frequently isolated species worldwide, and accounts for 60% of cases in the developing world; &quot;S. sonnei&quot; causes 77% of cases in the developed world, compared to only 15% of cases in the developing world; and &quot;S. dysenteriae&quot; is usually the cause of epidemics of dysentery, particularly in confined populations such as refugee camps.

Each of the &quot;Shigella&quot; genomes includes a virulence plasmid that encodes conserved primary virulence determinants. The &quot;Shigella&quot; chromosomes share most of their genes with those of &quot;E. coli&quot; K12 strain MG1655.

Phylogenetic studies indicate &quot;Shigella&quot; is more appropriately treated as a subgroup of &quot;Escherichia&quot; (see &quot;Escherichia coli#Diversity&quot; for details).

== Pathogenesis ==
&quot;Shigella&quot; infection is typically by ingestion. Depending on the host&#x27;s health, fewer than 100 bacterial cells may cause an infection. &quot;Shigella&quot; species generally invade the epithelial lining of the colon, causing severe inflammation and death of the cells lining the colon. This inflammation produces the hallmark diarrhea — even dysentery — of &quot;Shigella&quot; infection. Toxins produced by some strains contribute to disease during infection. &quot;S. flexneri&quot; strains produce ShET1 and ShET2, which may contribute to diarrhea. &quot;S. dysenteriae&quot; strains produce the hemolytic Shiga toxin, similar to the verotoxin produced by enterohemorrhagic &quot;E. coli&quot;. Both Shiga toxin and verotoxin are associated with causing potentially fatal hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

Because they do not interact with the apical surface of epithelial cells — preferring the basolateral side &quot;— Shigella&quot; species invade the host through the M-cells interspersed in the epithelia of the small intestine. &quot;Shigella&quot; uses a type-III secretion system that acts as a biological syringe to translocate toxic effector proteins to the target human cell. The effector proteins can alter the metabolism of the target cell — leading, for example, to the lysis of vacuolar membranes or reorganization of actin polymerization to facilitate intracellular motility of &quot;Shigella&quot; bacteria inside the host cell. For instance, the IcsA effector protein (an autotransporter, not a type-III secretion-system effector) triggers actin reorganization by N-WASP recruitment of Arp2/3 complexes, promoting cell-to-cell spread.
The Type III Secretion System (T3SS) plays a crucial role when Shigella secretes its OspC1 and OspC3 proteins to suppress the interferon (IFN) signaling pathway and inhibit the host defense against Shigella. These proteins have been found to target the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, reducing and preventing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression.

OspC1 and OspC3 inhibit IFN signaling by binding to calmodulin (CaM), which is required for the phosphorylation of STAT. These Shigella proteins interact with CaM through their N-terminal α-helix, which mimics the interaction with CaMKII. As a result, CaM mistakenly recognizes the bacterial proteins as CaMKII, preventing the normal function of the signaling pathway and blocking ISG expression.

While bacterial inhibition of the IFN signaling pathway remains largely unexplored, it is a well-studied mechanism in viruses. However, research by Alponde et al. (2022) identified homologous proteins and provided strong evidence that inhibiting IFN signaling is a conserved bacterial strategy.|Alponde, R., Ceccarelli, D. F., Wu, X., Dhe-Paganon, S., &amp; Park, E. (2022).| Bacterial calmodulin inhibitors block host innate immune signaling.| Cell, |185(12),| 2090-2103.|https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.025&lt;/ref&gt;

After infection, &quot;Shigella&quot; cells multiply intracellularly and spread to neighboring epithelial cells, resulting in tissue destruction and the characteristic pathology of shigellosis. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, fever, nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and flatulence. Infection is also commonly known to cause large and painful bowel movements. The stool may contain blood, mucus, or pus. Hence, &quot;Shigella&quot; cells may cause dysentery. In rare cases, young children may have seizures. Symptoms can take as long as a week to appear, but most often begin two to four days after ingestion. Symptoms usually last for several days, but can last for weeks. &quot;Shigella&quot; is implicated as one of the pathogenic causes of reactive arthritis worldwide.

==Discovery==
The &quot;Shigella&quot; genus is named after Japanese physician Kiyoshi Shiga, who researched the cause of dysentery. Shiga entered the Tokyo Imperial University School of Medicine in 1892, during which he attended a lecture by Shibasaburo Kitasato. Shiga was impressed by Kitasato&#x27;s intellect and confidence, so after graduating, he went to work for him as a research assistant at the Institute for Infectious Diseases. In 1897, Shiga focused his efforts on what the Japanese referred to as a &quot;sekiri&quot; (dysentery) outbreak. Such epidemics were detrimental to the Japanese people and occurred often in the late 19th century. The 1897 &quot;sekiri&quot; epidemic affected &gt;91,000, with a mortality rate of &gt;20%. Shiga studied 32 dysentery patients and used Koch&#x27;s postulates to successfully isolate and identify the bacterium causing the disease. He continued to study and characterize the bacterium, identified its methods of (Shiga-) toxin production, and worked to create a vaccine for the disease.

<doc id="92413" wikidata="Q43301" url="?curid=92413" title="Fresno, California">
<text>Fresno (; ) is a city in the San Joaquin Valley of California, United States. It is the county seat of Fresno County and the largest city in the greater Central Valley region. It covers about and had a population of 542,107 as of the 2020 census, making it the fifth-most populous city in California, the most populous inland city in California, and the 34th-most populous city in the nation.

Named for the abundant ash trees lining the San Joaquin River, Fresno was founded in 1872 as a railway station of the Central Pacific Railroad before it was incorporated in 1885. It has since become an economic hub of Fresno County and the San Joaquin Valley, with much of the surrounding areas in the Metropolitan Fresno region predominantly tied to large-scale agricultural production. Fresno is near the geographic center of California, approximately north of Los Angeles, south of the state capital, Sacramento, and southeast of San Francisco. Yosemite National Park is about to the north, Kings Canyon National Park to the east, and Sequoia National Park to the southeast.

Fresno is also the third-largest majority-Hispanic city in the United States with 50.5% of its population being Hispanic in 2020.

==History==

The original inhabitants of the San Joaquin Valley region were the Yokuts people and Miwok people, who engaged in trading with other Californian tribes of Native Americans including coastal peoples such as the Chumash of the Central California coast, with whom they are thought to have traded plant and animal products.

The first European to enter the San Joaquin Valley was Pedro Fages in 1772. The county of Fresno was formed in 1856 after the California Gold Rush and was named for the abundant ash trees (Spanish: fresno) lining the San Joaquin River.

The San Joaquin River flooded on December 24, 1867, inundating Millerton. Some residents rebuilt, others moved. Flooding also destroyed the town of Scottsburg on the nearby Kings River that winter. Rebuilt on higher ground, Scottsburg was renamed Centerville.

In 1867, Anthony Easterby purchased land bounded by the present Chestnut, Belmont, Clovis and California avenues, that today is called the Sunnyside district. Unable to grow wheat for lack of water, he hired sheep man Moses Church in 1870 to create an irrigation system. Building new canals and purchasing existing ditches, Church then formed the Fresno Canal and Irrigation Company, a predecessor of the Fresno Irrigation District.

In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near Easterby&#x27;s—by now a hugely productive wheat farm—for its new Southern Pacific line. Soon there was a store near the station and the store grew into the town of Fresno Station, later called Fresno. At that time, Mariposa street was the main artery, a rough dusty or muddy depression. Many Millerton residents, drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding, moved to the new community. Fresno became an incorporated city in 1885. In 1903, the faltering San Joaquin Power Company was renamed the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation and included the Fresno City Water Company and the Fresno City Railway. By 1931 the railway, now known as the Fresno Traction Company, operated 47 streetcars over of track.
Two years after the station was established, county residents voted to move the county seat from Millerton to Fresno. When the Friant Dam was completed in 1944, the site of Millerton became inundated by the waters of Millerton Lake. In extreme droughts, when the reservoir shrinks, ruins of the original county seat can still be observed.

In the nineteenth century, with so much wooden construction and in the absence of sophisticated firefighting resources, fires often ravaged American frontier towns. The greatest of Fresno&#x27;s early-day fires, in 1882, destroyed an entire block of the city. Another devastating blaze struck in 1883.

In 1919, Fresno&#x27;s first and oldest synagogue, Temple Beth Israel, was founded.

As a result of its remoteness from the great universities of the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles, Fresno became a statewide leader in educational innovation. In 1910, Fresno High School was the first California high school to take advantage of the Upward Extension Act of 1907 to offer lower-division college-level coursework to local high school graduates who wanted to attend college but were reluctant to move hundreds of miles away to do so. The high school&#x27;s Collegiate Department evolved into Fresno City College, the oldest community college in California and the second oldest in the United States. In the 1920s and 1930s, Fresno State Teachers College was at the forefront of the evolution of the state teachers colleges into state colleges offering a broad liberal arts education. The state colleges later became the California State University and Fresno State became California State University, Fresno.

Fresno entered the ranks of the 100 most populous cities in the United States in 1960 with a population of 134,000. Thirty years later, in the 1990 census, it moved up to 47th place with 354,000, and in the census of 2000, it achieved 37th place with 428,000.

The Fresno Municipal Sanitary Landfill was the first modern landfill in the United States, and incorporated several important innovations to waste disposal, including trenching, compacting, and the daily covering of trash with dirt. It was opened in 1937 and closed in 1987. It is a National Historic Landmark as well as a Superfund site.

Before World War II, Fresno had many ethnic neighborhoods, including Little Armenia, German Town, Little Italy, and Chinatown. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported Fresno&#x27;s population as 94.0% white, 3.3% black and 2.7% Asian. Chinatown was primarily a Japanese neighborhood and today few Japanese-American businesses remain. During 1942, Pinedale, in what is now North Fresno, was the site of the Pinedale Assembly Center, an interim facility for the relocation of Fresno area Japanese Americans to internment camps. The Fresno Fairgrounds were also utilized as an assembly center.

Row crops and orchards gave way to urban development particularly in the period after World War II; this transition was particularly vividly demonstrated in locations such as the Blackstone Avenue corridor.

Fresno&#x27;s geographical remoteness also made it an early pioneer in the field now known as fintech, long before the term was invented. In September 1958, Bank of America launched a new product called BankAmericard in Fresno. The city was specifically selected in part for its remoteness, to limit damage to the bank&#x27;s image in case the project failed. After a troubled gestation during which its creator resigned, BankAmericard went on to become the world&#x27;s first successful credit card. This financial instrument was usable across a large number of merchants and also allowed cardholders to revolve a balance (earlier financial products could do one or the other but not both). In 1970, BankAmericard was spun off into a separate company, and in 1976, that company became Visa Inc.

In the 1960s, Fresno suffered numerous demolitions of historic buildings, including the old Fresno County Courthouse and the original buildings of Edison High School. This was the result of car-centric urban planning focused on making more room for cars and parking lots, a commonplace approach in the United States at that time.

The dance style commonly known as popping evolved in Fresno in the 1970s.

In 1995, the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Operation Rezone sting resulted in several prominent Fresno and Clovis politicians being charged in connection with taking bribes in return for rezoning farmland for housing developments. Before the sting brought a halt to it, housing developers could buy farmland cheaply, pay off council members to have it rezoned, and make a large profit building and selling inexpensive housing. Sixteen people were eventually convicted as a result of the sting.

In the early 2000s, Fresno&#x27;s two major venues were built, Chukchansi Park (2002) and Save Mart Center (2003). The 2017 Fresno shootings resulted in the death of 4 people.

==Geography==

Fresno has a total area of with 98.96% land covering , and 1.04% water, .

Fresno&#x27;s location, very near the geographical center of California, places the city a comfortable distance from many of the major recreation areas and urban centers in the state. Just south of Yosemite National Park, it is the nearest major city to the park. Likewise, Sierra National Forest is , Kings Canyon National Park is and Sequoia National Park is . The city is located near several Sierra Nevada lakes including Bass Lake, Shaver Lake, and Huntington Lake. Fresno is also only two and a half hours from Monterey, Carmel, Big Sur and the central coast.

Because Fresno sits at the junction of Highways 41 and 99 (SR 41 is Yosemite National Park&#x27;s southern access road, and SR 99 bypasses Interstate 5 to serve the urban centers of the San Joaquin Valley), the city is a major gateway for Yosemite visitors coming from Los Angeles. The city also serves as an entrance into Sierra National Forest via Highway 168, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks via Highway 180.

Fresno has three large public parks, two in the city limits and one in county land to the southwest. Woodward Park, which features the Shinzen Japanese Gardens, boasts numerous picnic areas and several miles of trails. It is in North Fresno and is adjacent to the San Joaquin River Parkway. Roeding Park, near Downtown Fresno, is home to the Fresno Chaffee Zoo, and Rotary Storyland and Playland. Kearney Park is the largest of the Fresno region&#x27;s park system and is home to historic Kearney Mansion and plays host to the annual Civil War Revisited, the largest reenactment of the Civil War in the west coast of the U.S.

In its 2023 ParkScore ranking, The Trust for Public Land, a national land conservation organization, reported that Fresno had one of the worst park systems among the 100 most populous U.S. cities, with only 5% of city land being used for parks and recreation. The survey measures median park size, park acres as percent of city area, residents&#x27; access to parks, spending on parks per resident, and playgrounds per 10,000 residents.

===Neighborhoods===
====Downtown====
 The Central Pacific Railroad built a small wooden depot in 1872. In 1889, the Southern Pacific Railroad, which had acquired Central Pacific, constructed a new depot on the original depot site. The brick Queen Anne style depot was a jewel for the city and is one of Fresno&#x27;s oldest standing buildings. In 1971, 99 years after it first opened for business on its current site, the Depot closed its rail operations due to the decline in business.

Between the 1880s and World War II, Downtown Fresno flourished, filled with electric streetcars, and contained a number of &quot;lavish&quot; and &quot;opulent&quot; buildings. Among them, the original Fresno County Courthouse (demolished), the Fresno Carnegie Public Library (demolished), the Old Fresno Water Tower, the Bank of Italy Building, the Pacific Southwest Building, the San Joaquin Light and Power Building (currently known as the Grand 1401), and the Hughes Hotel (burned down), to name a few.

Fulton Street in Downtown Fresno was Fresno&#x27;s main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation&#x27;s first pedestrian malls in 1964. Renamed the Fulton Mall, the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in Fresno. While the Fulton Mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday, the Mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country, including a casting of Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s bronze &quot;The Washer Woman&quot;, reportedly the only one of the six castings that one can walk up to and touch. In October 2017, the City of Fresno finished and opened Fulton Mall to traffic, becoming Fulton Street. This change was celebrated with a large public parade featuring current mayor Lee Brand and former mayor Ashley Swearengin. The public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks (up to 28&#x27; on the east side of the street) to continue with the pedestrian-friendly environment of the district.

====Tower District====

The historic Tower Theatre, which is included on the National Register of Historic Places, is the center of the Tower District. The theater was built in 1939 at the corner of Olive and Wishon Avenues. The Tower District neighborhood is just north of downtown Fresno proper, and one-half mile south of Fresno City College. Although the neighborhood was known as a residential area, the early commercial establishments of the Tower District began with small shops and services that flocked to the area shortly after World War II. The character of small local businesses largely remains today. To some extent, the businesses of the Tower District were developed due to the proximity of the original Fresno Normal School (later renamed California State University at Fresno). In 1916, the college moved to what is now the site of Fresno City College one-half mile north of the Tower District.

After decades of neglect and suburban flight, the neighborhood revival followed the re-opening of the Tower Theatre in the late 1970s, which at that time showed second- and third-run movies, along with classic films. Roger Rocka&#x27;s Dinner Theater &amp; Good Company Players also opened nearby in 1978, at Olive and Wishon Avenues. Fresno native Audra McDonald performed in the leading roles of Evita and The Wiz at the theater while she was a high school student. McDonald subsequently became a leading performer on Broadway in New York City and a Tony award-winning actress. Also in the Tower District is Good Company Players&#x27; 2nd Space Theatre.

The Tower District is a hub for community events such as Jamaica My Weekend, Mardi Gras in February, Gay Pride Parade, car shows, A Taste of The Tower, Halloween in the Tower, the Farmers&#x27; market opened on the northwest corner of Olive and Van Ness and LitHop, an annual literary festival, featuring mostly local writers.

The neighborhood features restaurants, live theater and nightclubs, as well as several independent shops and bookstores on or near Olive Avenue. Since renewal, the Tower District has become an attractive area for restaurant and other local businesses. The Tower District is known as the center of Fresno&#x27;s LGBT and hipster communities.

The area is also known for its early twentieth century homes, many of which have been restored in recent decades. The area includes many California Bungalow and American Craftsman style homes, Spanish Colonial Revival Style architecture, Mediterranean Revival Style architecture, Mission Revival Style architecture, and many Storybook houses designed by Fresno architects, Hilliard, Taylor &amp; Wheeler. The residential architecture of the Tower District contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of Fresno.

====Woodward Park====
In the northeastern part of Fresno, Woodward Park was founded by the late Ralph Woodward, a long-time Fresno resident. He bequeathed a major portion of his estate in 1968 to provide a regional park and bird sanctuary in Northeast Fresno. The park lies on the southern bank of the San Joaquin River between Highway 41 and Friant Road. The initial , combined with additional acres acquired later by the city, brings the park to a sizable . Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, an authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, bike park, two playgrounds, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children&#x27;s playgrounds, a lake, three small ponds, seven picnic areas, and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway&#x27;s Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park&#x27;s amphitheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others. Woodward Park hosts the annual California Interscholastic Federation State Championship cross country meet. It is the home of the Woodward Shakespeare Festival which began performances in the park in 2005.

====Fig Garden====
Located in the western portion of Fresno, Old Fig Garden is an unincorporated community that, over time, has been completely encircled by the city of Fresno. Fig Garden was created in 1947, as the then-known Fig Garden Men&#x27;s club achieved nonprofit corporate status, allowing itself to have much more governance.

In 1979, the name was changed to Fig Garden Home Owners Association. Fig Garden is unique to the rest of Fresno, as it features largely no sidewalks and is lined with various large trees. The homes are well-maintained and landscaped due to strict regulations from the homeowners association. Due to a tax Fig Garden residences voted for, there is nearly round-the-clock sheriff service within the district. The district hosts the Fig Garden Christmas Tree Lane, which is a nationally recognized event. There is also an upscale swim and racquet club located in northwestern Fig garden, which has multiple amenities including a heated lap pool, massage therapy, daycare, etc. Towards the northern boundary there is a shopping center called Fig Garden Village which hosts a plethora of upscale shopping opportunities.

==Transportation==
===Highways===

Fresno is served by State Route 99, the main north–south freeway that connects the major population centers of California&#x27;s Central Valley. State Route 168, the Sierra Freeway, heads east to the city of Clovis and Huntington Lake. State Route 41 (Yosemite Freeway/Eisenhower Freeway) comes into Fresno from Atascadero in the south, and then heads north to Yosemite National Park. State Route 180 (Kings Canyon Freeway) comes from the west via Mendota, and then east through the city of Reedley to Kings Canyon National Park.

Fresno is the most populous U.S. city not directly linked to an Interstate highway. When the Interstate Highway System was created in the 1950s, the decision was made to build what is now Interstate 5 on the west side of the Central Valley, and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region, instead of upgrading what is now State Route 99. Due to rapidly rising population and traffic in cities along SR 99, as well as the desirability of Federal funding, much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system, most likely as Interstate 7 or 9. Major improvements to signage, lane width, median separation, vertical clearance, and other concerns are currently underway.

===Bus services===

Fresno Area Express (FAX) is the city&#x27;s primary public transit system, which operates eighteen routes and Handy Ride, a paratransit operation. FAX introduced a frequent bus service called FAX15 in January 2017 with buses operating every 15 minutes on Cedar and Shaw Avenues. The FAX Q line, which the agency brands as bus rapid transit, was introduced in February 2018 and offers service as often as every 10 minutes on Blackstone Avenue, Ventura Avenue and Kings Canyon Road.

As the county seat and the largest city in the region, Fresno also sees service from neighboring regional bus services including Clovis Transit, Fresno County Rural Transit Agency, Kings Area Regional Transit, and Visalia Transit&#x27;s V-LINE. Intercity and long-distance bus services are provided by Greyhound.

The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System added summer seasonal service between Fresno and Yosemite National Park in May 2015.

The city once provided trolley service during the late 19th and early 20th century. Known as the Fresno City Railway Company and later the Fresno Traction Company, the service operated horse-drawn streetcars from 1887 to 1901. Electric streetcars were introduced in 1903. The electric streetcars were used until 1939. A proposal to include a modern light rail system in long-term transportation plans was rejected by the Fresno County Board of Supervisors in January 1987.

===Airports===

Fresno Yosemite International Airport (airport code: FAT), formerly known as Fresno Air Terminal, provides regularly scheduled commercial airline service. The airport serves an estimated 1.3 million passengers annually.

Fresno Chandler Executive Airport (airport code: FCH) is southwest of Downtown Fresno. Built in the 1920s by the Works Projects Administration, it is one of the oldest operational airports in California. The airport currently serves as a general aviation airport.

Extra-wide streets surrounding the airport allow for residents of the community to land, taxi down the extra-wide streets, and park their aircraft in a garage at their home. Sierra Sky Park is recognized as the first residential aviation community in the world.

===Rail===

Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak &quot;San Joaquins&quot;. The main passenger rail station is the renovated historic Santa Fe Railroad Depot in Downtown Fresno. The city of Fresno is planned to be served by the future California High-Speed Rail.

Freight rail service is provided by both the BNSF Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad, which both operate Bakersfield-Stockton mainlines that cross in Fresno, and both railroads maintain railyards within the city. The shortline San Joaquin Valley Railroad also operates former Southern Pacific branch lines heading west and south out of the city.

==In popular culture==
In the 1970s, the city was the subject of a song, &quot;Walking Into Fresno&quot;, written by Hall Of Fame guitarist Bill Aken and recorded by Bob Gallion of the &quot;WWVA Jamboree&quot; radio and television show in Wheeling, West Virginia. Aken also made his first TV appearance playing guitar on the old country-western show at The Fresno Barn.

Fictional residents of the town were portrayed in a 1986 comedic miniseries titled &quot;Fresno&quot;, featuring Carol Burnett, Dabney Coleman, Teri Garr and Charles Grodin, along with numerous other celebrities. The mini series was presented as a parody of the prime time soap operas popular in the 1980s.

BBC documentarian, Louis Theroux, visited Fresno, and rode with Fresno police as they dealt with the high drug usage in the city. Additionally, he interviewed many of the individuals involved in the drug scene, some languishing in their habit, and others working to overcome it. From that footage, he produced a British documentary The City Addicted to Crystal Meth, first aired on August 9, 2009.

<text>Nils Gustaf Dalén (; 30 November 1869 – 9 December 1937) was a Swedish engineer and industrialist who was the long-term CEO of the AGA company and inventor of the AGA cooker and the Dalén light. In 1912, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his &quot;invention of automatic regulators for use in conjunction with gas accumulators for illuminating lighthouses and buoys&quot;.

==Early years==

Dalén was born in Stenstorp, a small village in Falköping Municipality, Västra Götaland County. He managed the family farm, which he expanded to include a market garden, a seed merchants and a dairy. In 1892 he invented a milk-fat tester to check milk quality of the milk delivered and went to Stockholm to show his new invention for Gustaf de Laval. de Laval was impressed by the self-taught Dalén and the invention and encouraged him to get a basic technical education. He was admitted to the Chalmers University of Technology where he earned his Master&#x27;s degree and a Doctorate on leaving in 1896. Dalén was much the same type of inventor as Gustaf de Laval, not afraid of testing &quot;impossible&quot; ideas, but Dalén was much more careful with the company economy. The products should have a solid market place before he introduced a new product.

==Career with AGA==
In 1906 Dalén became chief engineer at the Gas Accumulator Company (manufacturer and distributor of acetylene) and in 1909 when AGA was founded, he was appointed the managing director for the company. During his life, AGA was one of the most innovative companies in Sweden and produced a large variety of products that grew every year. Finally in the early 1970s AGA was forced to reduce the number of markets it was involved in and concentrate on the production of gases for industrial use.

In 1909 he ascended to the position of managing director of the renamed company Svenska Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator (AGA). AGA developed lighthouses using Dalén&#x27;s products. In 1910 the company bought a large real estate in Lidingö and built a production plant that was completed around 1912, when they moved out from the facilities in Stockholm.

===Dalén light===
Initially Dalén worked with acetylene (IUPAC: ethyne), a flammable and sometimes explosive hydrocarbon gas. Dalén invented Agamassan (Aga), a substrate used to absorb the gas allowing safe storage and hence commercial exploitation.

Acetylene produced an ultra-bright white light which superseded the less bright LPG as the fuel of choice for lighthouse illumination.

Dalén exploited the new fuel, developing the Dalén light which incorporated another invention, the sun valve. This device allowed the light to operate only at night, conserving fuel, and extending their service life to over a year.

The &#x27;Dalen Flasher&#x27; was a device that, except for a small pilot light, only consumed gas during the flash stage. This reduced gas consumption by more than 90%. The AGA lighthouse equipment worked without any type of electric supply and was thus extremely reliable.

To a rugged coastal area like Scandinavia, his mass-produced, robust, minimal maintenance buoys were a significant boon to safety and livelihood. AGA Lighthouses covered the entire Panama Canal.

===AGA cooker===
In 1922 he patented his invention of the AGA cooker. Most of the testing for the cooker was made in his private kitchen in his Villa Ekbacken that was built when AGA moved to Lidingö in 1912 but that he never actually had a chance to see with his own eyes. His family helped him with the development work, checking temperatures, airflow etc., as the development work proceeded.

==Personal life==
His parents were Anders and Lovisa Dalén. He married Elma Persson in 1901. They had four children, two daughters and two sons:
*Maja, married Silfverstolpe (1904–1995)
*Gunnar (1905–1970)
*Anders (1907–1994)
*Inga-Lisa, married Keen (1910–2004)

===The accident in 1912===
Early in 1912, Dalén was blinded in an acetylene explosion during a test of maximum pressure for the accumulators. Later the same year he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on lighthouse technology. Too ill to attend the presentation, Dalén had his brother, ophthalmologist Professor Albin Dalén of the Caroline Institute, stand in his place.

The presentation speech praised the quality of sacrificing personal safety in scientific experimentation, a compliment that compared Dalén with Alfred Nobel himself. Despite his blindness, Dalén controlled AGA until his death in 1937. He received over 100 patents during his lifetime.

Dalén died on 9 December 1937 at the age of 68.

<text>Stanley Lloyd Miller (March 7, 1930 – May 20, 2007) was an American chemist who made important experiments concerning the origin of life by demonstrating that a wide range of vital organic compounds can be synthesized by fairly simple chemical processes from inorganic substances. In 1952 he performed the Miller–Urey experiment, which showed that complex organic molecules could be synthesised from inorganic precursors. The experiment was widely reported, and provided evidence for the idea that the chemical evolution of the early Earth had caused the natural synthesis of organic compounds from inanimate inorganic molecules.

==Life and career==

Stanley Miller was born in Oakland, California. He was the second child (after a brother, Donald) of Nathan and Edith Miller, descendants of Jewish immigrants from Belarus and Latvia. His father was an attorney and had the office of the Oakland Deputy District Attorney in 1927. His mother was a school teacher so that education was a natural environment in the family. In fact, while in Oakland High School he was nicknamed &quot;a chem whiz&quot;. He followed his brother to the University of California at Berkeley to study chemistry mainly because he felt that Donald would be able to help him with the topic. He completed his BSC in June 1951. He then had financial problems: His father died in 1946 and left the family poor. With help from the Berkeley faculty (UC Berkeley did not then grant research assistantships), he received a teaching assistantship at the University of Chicago in February, 1951. Teaching would provide the basic funds for graduate work. 

Miller enrolled in the University of Chicago PhD program in September 1951. He searched frantically for a thesis topic, met professors, and preferred theoretical problems rather than experiments, which tended to be laborious. He initially worked with the theoretical physicist Edward Teller on synthesis of elements. Conforming to the custom of the university, which was that graduate students attend seminars, he attended a chemistry seminar by Nobel laureate Harold Urey on the origin of solar system and the idea that organic synthesis was possible in a reducing environment, such as the primitive Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Miller was immensely inspired. 

After a year of fruitless work with Teller, and the prospect of Teller&#x27;s leaving Chicago to work on the hydrogen bomb, Urey approached Miller in September 1952 with a fresh research project. Urey was not immediately enthusiastic about Miller&#x27;s interest in pre-biotic synthesis: No successful work had been done. Urey suggested that Miller work on thallium in meteorites. With persistence, Miller persuaded Urey to experiment with electric discharges in gases. 

The experiments found evidence for the production of amino acids in the reaction vessel. Urey or Miller was afraid that specks of fly excrement might be the source of the amino acids (or was so chided by classmates). Excrement was not the source; the result was a demonstration that &quot;organic&quot; chemical compounds could be produced by purely inorganic processes. Miller earned a doctorate in 1954, and a long-lasting reputation. From spectroscopic observations of stars, it is now well known that complex organic compounds form from the gases of carbon-rich stars. The fundamental issue, the connection between &quot;pre-biotic organic&quot; compounds and the origin of life, has remained.

After completing a doctorate, Miller transferred to the California Institute of Technology as a F. B. Jewett Fellow in 1954 and 1955. Here he worked on the mechanism involved in the synthesis of amino and hydroxycarboxylic acids. He then joined the Department of Biochemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, where he worked for the next five years. When the new University of California at San Diego was established, he became the first assistant professor of the Department of Chemistry in 1960, and an associate professor in 1962, and then a full Professor in 1968.

He supervised 8 PhD students including Jeffrey L. Bada. He also co-authored the book &quot;The Origin of Life on Earth.&quot;

==Miller&#x27;s experiment==

The Miller experiment was described in his technical paper in the 15 May 1953 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, which transformed the concept of scientific ideas concerning the origin of life into a respectable empirical inquiry. His study has become a classic textbook definition of the scientific basis of origin of life, or more specifically, the first definitive experimental evidence of the Oparin and Haldane&#x27;s &quot;primordial soup&quot; theory. Urey and Miller designed to simulate the ocean-atmospheric condition of the primitive Earth by using a continuous stream of steam into a mixture of methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen (H2). The gaseous mixture was then exposed to electrical discharge, which induced chemical reaction. After a week of reaction, Miller detected the formation of amino acids, such as glycine, α- and β-alanine, using paper chromatography. He also detected aspartic acid and gamma-amino butyric acid, but was not confident about them. Since amino acids are the basic structural and functional constituents of cellular life, the experiment showed the possibility of natural organic synthesis for the origin of life on earth.

===Publication problem===

Miller showed his results to Urey, who suggested immediate publication. Urey refused to be the co-author lest Miller receive little or no credit. The manuscript with Miller as the sole author was submitted to the magazine &quot;Science&quot; on 10 February 1953. After waiting several weeks, Urey inquired and wrote to the chairman of the editorial board on 27 February on the lack of action in reviewing the manuscript. A month passed, but still there was no decision. On 10 March the infuriated Urey demanded the manuscript to be returned, and he himself submitted it to the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; on 13 March. By then, the editor of &quot;Science&quot;, apparently annoyed by Urey&#x27;s insinuation, wrote directly to Miller that the manuscript was to be published. Miller then withdrew the manuscript from the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot;.

===Follow-up===

Miller continued his research until his death in 2007. As the knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s early atmosphere progressed, and techniques for chemical analyses improved, he continued to refine the details and methods. He succeeded not only in synthesizing more and more varieties of amino acids, he also produced a wide variety of inorganic and organic compounds essential for cellular construction and metabolism. In support, a number of independent researchers also confirmed the range of chemical syntheses. With the recent revelation that, unlike the original Miller&#x27;s experimental hypothesis of a strongly reducing condition, the primitive atmosphere could have been quite neutral, containing other gases in different proportions. Miller&#x27;s last works, published posthumously in 2008, still succeeded in synthesizing an array of organic compounds using such conditions.

==Reassessment==

In 1972 Miller and his collaborators repeated the 1953 experiment, but with newly developed automatic chemical analysers, such as ion-exchange chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. They synthesized 33 amino acids, including 10 that are known to occur naturally in organisms. These included all of the primary alpha-amino acids found in the Murchison meteorite, which fell on Australia in 1969. A subsequent electric discharge experiment actually produced more variety of amino acids than that in the meteorite.

Just before Miller&#x27;s death, several boxes containing vials of dried residues were found among his laboratory materials in the university. A note indicated that some were from his original 1952-1954 experiments, produced by using three different apparatuses, and one from 1958, which included hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in the gaseous mixture for the first time, a result which was never published. In 2008 his students re-analysed the 1952 samples using more sensitive techniques, such as high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography–time of flight
mass spectrometry. Their result showed the synthesis of 22 amino acids and 5 amines, revealing that the original Miller experiment produced many more compounds than actually reported in 1953. The unreported 1958 samples were analysed in 2011, from which 23 amino acids and 4 amines, including 7 sulfurous compounds, were detected.

==Death==

Miller suffered a series of strokes beginning in November 1999 that increasingly inhibited his physical activity. He was living in a nursing home in National City, south of San Diego, and died on 20 May 2007 at the nearby Paradise Hospital. He was survived by his brother Donald and his family, and his partner Maria Morris.

==Honours and recognitions==

Miller is remembered for his work concerning the origin of life (and he was considered a pioneer of the topics of exobiology), the natural occurrence of clathrate hydrates, and general mechanisms of action of anaesthesia. He was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 1973. He was an Honorary Counselor of Spain&#x27;s Higher Council for Scientific Research in 1973. He was awarded the Oparin Medal by the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life in 1983, and served as its president from 1986 to 1989.

He was nominated for Nobel Prize more than once during his life.

The &quot;Stanley L. Miller Award&quot; for scientists younger than the age of 37 was instituted by the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life in 2008.

<text>AGA AB, previously AB Gasaccumulator and AB Svenska Gasaccumulator, was a Swedish industrial gas company founded in 1904. Nobel Prize laureate Gustaf Dalén was an important part of the development of the company. Inventions included the AGA cooker and the Dalén light. In the 1990s, AGA conceived and developed HiQ for specialty gases. In 2000, AGA (which stands for Aktiebolaget Gas Accumulator) was integrated into Linde AG.

<text>Interstate 64 (I-64) is an east–west Interstate Highway in the Eastern United States. Its western terminus is at I-70, U.S. Route 40 (US 40), and US 61 in Wentzville, Missouri. Its eastern terminus is at the Bowers Hill Interchange with I-264 and I-664 at Bower&#x27;s Hill in Chesapeake, Virginia. I-64 connects Greater St. Louis, the Louisville metropolitan area, the Lexington–Fayette metropolitan area, the Charleston metropolitan area, the Greater Richmond Region, and Hampton Roads.

I-64 has concurrencies with I-55, I-57, I-75, I-77, I-81, and I-95. I-64 does not maintain exit number continuity for any of the overlaps, as each of the six north–south routes maintain their exit numbering on their respective overlaps with I-64. Of all the overlaps, I-64 only goes northeast and southwest with I-55 and I-81, while going southeast and northwest with the other Interstates.

===Missouri===
In Missouri, the stretch was originally labeled as the Daniel Boone Expressway then only as US 40, and, as such, is still known to some locals in Greater St. Louis as Highway 40, even though the road has been designated as both I-64 and US 40 since 1988. This road is also the southernmost portion of the Avenue of the Saints. An interchange at Highway N in O&#x27;Fallon opened on December 13, 2004. This interchange also accommodates the tie-in of the Route 364 freeway to I-64. In April 2007, construction started to rebuild of I-64 in St. Louis from Spoede Road to Kingshighway. This project included repaving the entire road, rebuilding the overpasses and interchanges, adding a fourth lane between Spoede Road and I-170, and connecting I-64 to I-170 in all directions. Construction resulted in the complete closure of portions of the expressway in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, I-64 was closed from I-270 to I-170, reopening December 15, 2008. Beginning December 15, 2008, I-64 from I-170 to Kingshighway was closed. On December 6, 2009, with a grand opening ceremony and dedication, I-64 was completed in its entire length in Missouri from the Poplar Street Bridge to I-70 in Wentzville. As of December 7, 2009, I-64 is now complete and signed all the way to I-70 in Wentzville. All stoplights have been removed. The portion of I-64 in St. Louis has been named the Jack Buck Memorial Highway, in honor of the late sportscaster.

===Illinois===
I-64 enters Illinois from St. Louis, Missouri, via the Poplar Street Bridge, where it overlaps I-55 as it crosses the Mississippi River. After crossing the city of East St. Louis and the rest of suburban St. Clair County, the freeway heads southeast through rural Southern Illinois. Shortly after passing MidAmerica St. Louis Airport at exit 23, I-64 enters Clinton County and then Washington County. After providing access to towns such as Carlyle, Breese, Nashville, and Centralia, the freeway overlaps I-57 through the Mount Vernon area for approximately . East of Mount Vernon in Illinois, services along I-64 are slim to none. It is an almost completely flat and empty freeway, crossing Jefferson, Wayne, and White counties as it progresses east toward Indiana and the Evansville, Indiana, area. East of the St. Louis area, there are numerous oilwells dotting the landscape.

The section from Illinois Route 127 (IL 127) to I-57 opened on October 4, 1974. The section from IL 161 to IL 127 opened in December 1973. The section in Metro East, except for a short section near I-55/I-70, opened on December 23, 1975. The section from US 460 (later IL 142) to US 45 opened on August 7, 1975.

===Indiana===
I-64 crosses the Wabash River and enters the state of Indiana. It passes Griffin (State Road 69, or SR 69; exit 4) and Poseyville (SR 165; exit 12) and also passes under nearby SR 68 (no direct interchange serves SR 68, though one can access said route from either SR 165 or SR 65). The Interstate then passes three officially marked exits for Evansville (SR 65, US 41, and I-69 [formerly designated as I-164]) then proceeds through part of the scenic Hoosier National Forest, with exits leading to Dale and Huntingburg (US 231; exit 57); Santa Claus and Ferdinand (SR 162; exit 63); French Lick and Tell City (SR 37; exit 79); and Indiana&#x27;s first state capital, Corydon (SR 135; exit 105).

Near milepost 61, there is a time change from the Central Time Zone (CT; Spencer County) to the Eastern Time Zone (ET; Dubois County). Between mileposts 60 and 80, I-64 crosses the CT–ET zone boundary five times. With most timezone changes on highways maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT), changes in timezone are not usually marked with any roadside signage. The final crossing into the ET zone at the Perry–Crawford county border, however, is marked with road signage.

Between Evansville and New Albany, I-64 intersects a few major north–south arterial highways, such as US 231, SR 37, and SR 135 and offers access to I-65 to Indianapolis via I-265 before crossing into Kentucky on the Sherman Minton Bridge.

The route in Indiana can be described as being somewhat winding, especially the farther east one travels within the state. The longest straight line distance along the route is the stretch from the SR 65 exit to mikemarker 26, east of US 41. There are many points along the route where the two halves of the highway are nearly apart, especially around the Hoosier National Forest and points to the east. In addition, there are several points, especially in the very sharp valleys along its route in Dubois, Perry, Crawford, and Harrison counties, where the highway towers more than above the surrounding terrain.

===Kentucky===
I-64 enters Kentucky at Louisville, paralleling the Ohio River along the Riverfront Expressway. It intersects with several downtown interchanges before coming to the Kennedy Interchange, where it intersects I-65 and I-71 in a tangle of ramps often referred to as the &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;. Moving eastward, I-64 passes through Shelbyville, Frankfort, Midway, Lexington, Winchester, Mount Sterling, Owingsville, and Morehead, before leaving the state near Ashland at Catlettsburg. It overlaps I-75 as it makes an arc around the northeast of Lexington&#x27;s urban core, with the exit numbers for I-75 used for the concurrent portion. The two Interstates separate a few miles east of downtown Lexington.

===West Virginia===

I-64 travels for within the state of West Virginia, passing by the major cities of Huntington, Beckley, and Lewisburg and directly through the capital city of Charleston. It has only two major junctions within the state: I-77 in Charleston and in Beckley. It also crosses the Kanawha River a total of four times in a stretch (twice west of Charleston, immediately before entering the downtown Charleston area, then approximately east of downtown Charleston in Kanawha City).

Between I-64&#x27;s two junctions with I-77, I-64 and I-77 overlap. From the final crossing of the Kanawha River east of Charleston to their split at exit 40 south of Beckley, the two Interstates are tolled, forming a part of the West Virginia Turnpike.

While the two expressways overlap, the exit signs are those for I-77. Thus, eastbound travelers entering from Kentucky will see exit numbers increase until exit 60, at which time I-77&#x27;s exit numbers are used, decreasing from exit 100.

===Virginia===
I-64 in Virginia runs east–west through central Virginia from West Virginia via Covington, Lexington, Staunton, and Charlottesville to Richmond. From Lexington to Staunton, it overlaps I-81 (using I-81 exit numbers). In Richmond, it overlaps I-95. From Richmond, I-64 continues southeasterly through Newport News and Hampton to the Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel and then through Norfolk and a small portion of Virginia Beach to end in Chesapeake.

I-64 itself does not reach the Oceanfront area of Virginia Beach, as it continues through the western portion of Virginia Beach as part of the circumferential Hampton Roads Beltway. At its terminus, eastbound I-64 runs over westbound (and westbound I-64 eastbound) as the route forms a fishhook around Norfolk. I-264 intersects the beltway, providing access to other parts of Norfolk and Chesapeake and extending east to the Oceanfront.

Access to the Oceanfront area is accomplished from I-64 via a portion of I-264, a roadway originally built as the Virginia Beach Expressway, funded by tolls to retire revenue bonds.

==History==
Elements of I-64, such as the Sherman Minton bridge over the Ohio River on the Indiana–Kentucky border, were completed by the early 1960s. The Interstate was complete between St. Louis and Charleston with the completion of the 9th Street overpass in Louisville in December 1976.

In Virginia, the proposed southern route between Clifton Forge and Richmond called for the Interstate to follow from Richmond via US 360 and US 460, via Lynchburg to Roanoke and US 220 from Roanoke to Clifton Forge, then west following US 60 into West Virginia. The initial 1957 recommendation by a state-retained engineering consultant was for the northern route, but, due in large part to the efforts of a Virginia Senator Mosby Perrow Jr. from Lynchburg, the state changed the location to the southern route in 1959. Despite assurances from the federal government that the route would be decided by the state, Virginia&#x27;s 1959 decision was overturned in favor of the northern route through Charlottesville.

I-64 had a proposed routing around the US 50 corridor in Illinois when the Interstates were first planned. Local pressure pushed the routing closer to the US 460 corridor because of the cheaper cost and shorter mileage compared to the original routing, but not before construction was started on a short section that is now US 50 between Vincennes, Indiana, and Lawrenceville, Illinois. It is also worth noting that the apparent route of I-64 would have taken it through the southern end of Carlyle Lake which was also under construction at this time.

I-64 signs started going up in August 1987 on the US 40 freeway in St. Louis. This change was made in part due to truck drivers deliberately using US 40 to avoid mandatory fines for overweight trucks.

On September 9, 2011, the Sherman Minton Bridge was closed down by Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels after construction crews found cracks in the main load bearing structural element. Mainline traffic was redirected to I-265, then south on I-65 across the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge before rejoining I-64 at the Kennedy Interchange in Louisville. Repairs were completed in a few months later, and the Sherman Minton Bridge reopened at 11:50 pm on February 17, 2012.

<text>Interstate 65 (I-65) is a major north–south interstate highway in the central United States. As with most primary interstates ending in 5, it is a major crosscountry, north–south route, connecting between the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. Its southern terminus is located at an interchange with I-10 in Mobile, Alabama, and its northern terminus is at an interchange with US 12 (US 12) and US 20 (the Dunes Highway) in Gary, Indiana, just southeast of Chicago. I-65 connects several major metropolitan areas in the Midwest and Southern US. It connects the four largest cities in Alabama: Mobile, Montgomery, Birmingham, and Huntsville. It also serves as one of the main north–south routes through Nashville, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; and Indianapolis, Indiana, each a major metropolitan area in its respective state.

=== Alabama ===

In the state of Alabama, I-65 passes through or near four of the state&#x27;s major metropolitan areas: Mobile, Montgomery, Birmingham, and Huntsville. I-65 begins its path northward in Mobile at its junction with I-10. From I-10, I-65 runs west of downtown Mobile and through the northern suburbs of the city before turning northeasterly towards Montgomery. In Montgomery, I-65 connects with the southern terminus of I-85. In the Birmingham suburbs, I-65 has an interchange with I-459 and another interchange in the city at I-20/I-59. North of downtown, I-22 branches off I-65 toward Memphis. From Birmingham, I-65 continues north, crossing the Tennessee River near Decatur. A few miles north of the river, it intersects I-565, a short spur route which provides access to Huntsville. It then continues northward out of the Tennessee Valley to the state of Tennessee toward Nashville.

=== Tennessee ===

I-65 enters Tennessee from the south near the town of Ardmore and passes through mostly rural territory for . It then passes Lewisburg. Then it passes close to Columbia and crosses Saturn Parkway, which brings travelers to the town of Spring Hill. I-65 then continues on to reach I-840 and progresses until it intersects State Route 96 (SR 96) at Franklin. Then the highway goes through Brentwood, and enters Nashville, where it first interchanges with I-440. It then has brief concurrences with I-40 and I-24 near downtown Nashville. The freeway then meets State Route 155 (SR 155, Briley Parkway), and after passing through Madison, meets SR 386 (Vietnam Veterans Boulevard) in Goodlettsville. The freeway then passes through Millersville and White House, and then, close to Portland, crosses into Kentucky.

=== Kentucky ===

I-65 enters the state south of Franklin. Throughout its length, it passes near Mammoth Cave National Park, Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest, the National Corvette Museum, and Fort Knox.

The first major intersection in the state is with I-165 (former Natcher Parkway) at Bowling Green. I-65 has intersections with three of the parkways in the state. The first major junction is with the Cumberland Parkway near Rocky Hill. At Elizabethtown, it has two more parkway interchanges with the Wendell H. Ford Western Kentucky Parkway and the Martha Layne Collins Bluegrass Parkway. I-65 also has interchanges with I-265, I-264, I-64, and I-71.

The widest stretch of I-65 in its entirety is in Louisville at Kentucky Route 1065 (KY 1065, Outer Loop), where the main line is 14 lanes wide. The highway crosses the Ohio River into Indiana on a toll bridge. The southbound side is called the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge (southbound) and the northbound side is called the Abraham Lincoln Bridge. The latter bridge opened in October 2016 as part of the Ohio River Bridges Project. Prior to the project, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge (completed in 1963) carried traffic in both directions. The project also included reconstruction of the I-65/I-64/I-71 convergence interchange just south of the Kennedy Bridge, as well as renovating the older span to carry six lanes of southbound traffic. Additionally, a second six-lane cable-stayed bridge upstream on the Ohio River, the Lewis and Clark Bridge, was built as part of the project, opening in December 2016 to complete the I-265 loop around Louisville.

At one time, the stretch of I-65 from Louisville to Elizabethtown was a toll road, called the Kentucky Turnpike. The bonds that financed the road have been paid off, and tolls are no longer collected. All signs of the former turnpike have been removed.

On November 15, 2006, the stretch of I-65 from Bowling Green to Louisville was renamed the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Expressway.

On February 12, 2007, a bill passed the Kentucky Senate to rename I-65 in Jefferson County the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway. Signs were posted July 25, 2007.

On July 15, 2007, Kentucky highway officials raised the speed limits on most Interstate and state parkway highways to . Prior to that, Kentucky was the only state along I-65 that had a maximum speed limit of .

=== Indiana ===


I-65 enters Indiana at Jeffersonville and Clarksville. Miles 0–9 were rebuilt, widened, and realigned from north of Sellersburg to the Ohio River during 2008–2010, giving great traffic relief to the fast-growing Indiana suburbs of Louisville. Over 300,000 of the 1.5 million people in Louisville&#x27;s CMSA live in its Indiana counties.

A section of I-65 in Downtown Indianapolis runs concurrently with I-70. The junctions are often referred to as the &quot;North Split&quot; and the &quot;South Split&quot;, forming a section of Interstate locally known as the &quot;Inner Loop&quot; or &quot;The Spaghetti Bowl&quot; due to the visual complexity of the intersecting ramps and overpasses.

In mid-March 2007, a section of I-70 from the North Split to I-465 east of downtown was restricted to automobiles only for the &quot;Super 70&quot; project, a massive rebuild and expansion of that freeway. Trucks over were forced to divert through I-65 if coming from the north and use the circular I-465 to the south to reconnect to I-70 eastbound. Westbound traffic from I-70 was required to loop north or south along I-465 to get to I-65 or I-70. The Super 70 project was completed in November 2007. In mid-2003, the portion of I-65 that runs concurrently with I-70 was closed to all traffic due to the &quot;HyperFix&quot; project. During that time, a new concrete surface was installed and the overpasses were upgraded.

In 1999, the segment of I-65 between the two I-465 interchanges was renamed the Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds Highway.

North of Lafayette near Brookston, the road passes through the Meadow Lake Wind Farm for several miles, with the turbines and standards spaced out in order to avoid a collapse onto the highway. The Fowler Ridge Wind Farm is also visible on both sides of the highway.

From its crossing into Lake County over the Kankakee River to its northern terminus, the highway is known as the Casimir Pulaski Memorial Highway.

Prior to 2004, the northern terminus of I-65 was only north of I-90 (Indiana Toll Road). Traffic going from I-90 to I-65 had to stop at a traffic signal to make a left turn. Traffic from I-65 to I-90 bypassed the traffic signal via an isolated right-turn lane. In 2004, the interchange was fully grade-separated, so it is now one interchange involving I-65, I-90, US 12, and US 20, thereby eliminating a connection gap in the Interstate Highway System.

==History==
The first section of Interstate 65 reused the Kentucky Turnpike, a toll road that opened on August 1, 1956. The first section of interstate highway in Tennessee constructed under the authorization of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was a short section of I-65 which opened on November 15, 1958. The first section of interstate highway to be completed in Alabama was also a section of I-65, which opened on December 10, 1959. The first section of I-65 in Indiana was opened on September 14, 1960. Kentucky was the first state to complete its portion of I-65, with the last stretch opening on June 22, 1970. The final section in Tennessee opened on October 26, 1973. The last section in Indiana, part of the concurrent section with I-70 in Indianapolis, opened on October 15, 1976. I-65 was not officially completed until December 19, 1985, when a section north of Birmingham opened, replacing a four-lane stretch of US 31 that had been designated as part of I-65 but did not meet interstate highway standards.

<text>Warmbloods are a group of middle-weight horse types and breeds primarily originating in Europe and registered with organizations that are characterized by open studbook policy, studbook selection, and the aim of breeding for equestrian sport. 

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;warmblood&quot; was coined to represent a mixing of cold blooded and hot blooded breeds.
* &quot;Cold blooded&quot; is a generic term meaning a heavy boned even-tempered horse breed from Northern Europe such as a Shire, Clydesdale or other draft horse breed. &quot;Cold&quot; is from the climate of their origin, and does not mean a cold-blooded animal.
* &quot;Hot blooded&quot; is a generic term meaning a high-spirited horse, generally of Arabian or Thoroughbred bloodlines. &quot;Hot&quot; refers to its temperament and the hot regions of the Middle East and North Africa from which they originated.

Although the term &quot;warmblood&quot; is occasionally used to indicate a horse which is a first generation cross between one hot- and one cold-blooded horse, the contemporary meaning refers to horses that have been bred over multiple generations to produce horses that perform well in various equestrian sports—predominantly show jumping, dressage, eventing, and combined driving.

&quot;Sport horse&quot; is a newer term for this type of horse. Older established breed registries retain the word &quot;warmblood&quot;, and newer registries tend to use the word &quot;sport horse&quot; (also spelled &quot;sporthorse&quot;).

== Breeding policies ==

Open studbook policies are different from &quot;true breed&quot; studbooks—such as those for Thoroughbreds, Arabians, Percherons, and Morgans—which have closed stud books and require two purebred parents to register an offspring. Instead, most warmblood registries accept breeding stock from other similar populations to continuously improve their own, and do not consider their own horses to be a discrete &quot;breed&quot;. The Trakehner is an exception, as although some other breeds are used within the breeding population, this horse is considered a true breed. The Hanoverian, Holsteiner, and Selle Français studbooks are also considered slightly less open than others. Most warmblood registries recognize breeding stock from any other registry that is a member of the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses which is affiliated with the Olympics-recognized International Federation for Equestrian Sports.

A defining characteristic of a warmblood registry is studbook selection, though even some purebred breeds in Europe use this practice. Studbook selection is the use of external evaluation to critique conformation and movement of potential breeding stock to cull unsuitable breeding horses and direct the evolution towards a particular goal. Today, studbook selection usually entails a performance proof in addition to external evaluation, particularly for stallions. 

Standards of conformation and movement are not designed to perpetuate a particular ancestral type, but rather to meet a particular need. This concept is illustrated by the history of the Oldenburg horse through the past 150 years: in the late 19th century, the standard called for a heavy but elegant, high-stepping carriage horse, in the early 20th century for a heavier, stronger, economical farm and artillery horse, and since 1950 for a modern sport horse. 

The most critical characteristic of a warmblood registry is that its breeding goal (or &quot;breeding aim&quot;) is to breed sport horses. Each registry has a slightly different focus, but most breed primarily for show jumping and dressage. Many include combined driving and eventing as well. The breeding aim is reflective of the needs of the market. In eras and regions which called for cavalry mounts, warmbloods were bred to fit that need; when and where horses for light to moderate agricultural work were needed, warmbloods have also filled those roles. The purposeful evolution of the standard breeding aim is another characteristic of the warmbloods.

Warmbloods have become popular since the end of World War II when mechanization made agricultural horses obsolete, and recreational riding became more widespread in the western world. The ancestral warmblood types are referred to as the heavy warmbloods and are preserved through special organizations. The heavy warmbloods have found their niche as family horses and in combined driving.

== Warmblood registries ==

Most warmbloods were developed in continental Europe, especially Germany. It was once thought that the warmblood type, which originated in continental Europe, descended from wild, native proto-warmblood ancestors, called the Forest Horse, though modern DNA studies of early horses have disproven this hypothesis.

The best-known German warmbloods are the Hanoverian, Holsteiner, Oldenburg and the purebred Trakehner. Others include the Württemberger, Rhinelander, Westphalian, Zweibrücker, Brandenburger, Mecklenburger, and Bavarian Warmblood. Several of these breeds are also represented by ancestral types such as the Ostfriesen and Alt-Oldenburger, Alt-Württemberger, and Rottaler.

Central European warmbloods include the French Selle Français, Belgian Warmblood, Dutch Warmblood, Swiss Warmblood, Austrian Warmblood, and Czech Warmblood. Scandinavian countries also produce high-quality warmbloods such as the Danish Warmblood and Swedish Warmblood.

Warmblood registries which are not based in continental Europe include those that regulate the breeding of American Warmbloods and Irish Sport Horses.

== List of warmblood breeds and types==

Not all breeds within the warmblood category are named &quot;warmblood&quot; as such in their studbooks, many have names based upon the geographical region where they were first developed. In some cases, where there is debate over whether a particular warmblood bloodline is a breed or a type, but the existence of either a studbook selection process in an open registry and/or a breed registry that is restricted or closed is utilized here.

<text>Interstate 66 (I-66) is a 76.32 mile east–west Interstate Highway in the eastern United States. The highway runs from an interchange with I-81 near Middletown, Virginia, on its western end to an interchange with U.S. Route 29 (US 29) in Washington, D.C., at the eastern terminus. The route parallels State Route 55 (SR 55) from its western terminus at I-81 to Gainesville, and US 29 from Gainesville to its eastern terminus in Washington. I-66 has no physical or historical connection to US 66, which was located in a different region of the United States.

The E Street Expressway is a spur from I-66 into the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

=== Virginia ===
==== Interstate 81 to Dunn Loring ====
I-66 begins at a directional T interchange with I-81 near Middletown, Virginia. It heads east as a four-lane freeway and meets US 522/US 340 at a partial cloverleaf interchange. The two routes head south to Front Royal and north to Lake Frederick. I-66 continues east and crosses the Blue Ridge at Manassas Gap, paralleling SR 55 (John Marshall Highway) and meeting US 17 at a partial interchange with no access from southbound US 17 to westbound I-66. SR 55 also merges onto the freeway at this interchange, forming a three-way concurrency that ends near Marshall, with SR 55 leaving along with U.S. Route 17 Business (US 17 Bus.) and US 17 leaving at the next exit. The freeway then passes through Bull Run Mountain at Thoroughfare Gap.

Expanding to six lanes, and continuing to parallel SR 55, I-66 enters the towns of Haymarket and Gainesville, reaching interchanges with US 15 (James Madison Highway) and US 29 (Lee Highway) in each town, respectively. The highway then expands to ten lanes and heads to the south of Manassas National Battlefield Park and to the north of Bull Run Regional Park. The highway reaches another interchange with US 29 and passes to the north of Centreville and meets SR 28 (Sully Road) at an interchange with cloverleaf and stack elements to it. SR 28 heads north to Dulles International Airport and south to Manassas.

The freeway then meets SR 286 (Fairfax County Parkway), US 50 (Lee Jackson Memorial Highway), and SR 123 (Chain Bridge Road) at a series of interchanges providing access to D.C. suburbs. The Orange Line and Silver Line of the Washington Metro begin to operate in the median here, as the highway reaches a large interchange with the I-495 (Capital Beltway).

I-66 has two tolled HOT lanes from US 29 in Gainesville to the Capital Beltway.

==== Dunn Loring to Theodore Roosevelt Bridge ====
The section of I-66 in Virginia east of the Capital Beltway is named the Custis Memorial Parkway, a toll road with variable tolls during peak hours. The road narrows to four lanes as it heads through Arlington County. The parkway meets SR 7 (Leesburg Pike) at a full interchange. SR 267 (Dulles Toll Road) meets the parkway with an eastbound entrance and westbound exit. Continuing through neighborhoods, the route yet again meets US 29 at an incomplete interchange and continues east into Arlington County, meeting SR 120 (Glebe Road) and continuing to Arlington County. It meets Spout Run Parkway and enters Rosslyn. The freeway turns southeast and runs in between US 29 as it approaches the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, reaching another eastbound entrance and westbound exit as US 29 continues north on the Key Bridge. It then has a complex interchange with George Washington Parkway and SR 110 (Richmond Highway), providing access to Alexandria and the Pentagon, respectively. US 50 (Arlington Boulevard) merges onto the highway with a westbound exit and eastbound entrance and the two traverse the bridge.

The &quot;Custis Memorial Parkway&quot; name commemorates the Custis family, several of whose members (including Martha Dandridge Custis Washington, George Washington Parke Custis, Eleanor &quot;Nelly&quot; Parke Custis Lewis and Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee) played prominent roles in Northern Virginia&#x27;s history. Because of its terminus in the Shenandoah Valley, some early planning documents refer to I-66 as the &quot;Shenandoah Freeway&quot;, although the name did not enter common use.

Between the Capital Beltway and the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge, the eastbound (inbound) roadway is a high-occupancy toll (HOT) road from 5:30 to 9:30 am, and the westbound (outbound) roadway is an HOT road from 3:00 to 7:00 pm. (Westbound tolling begins after exit 73 to US 29, in order to allow traffic crossing the bridge an opportunity to transfer to free roads.) E-ZPass is required for all vehicles except motorcycles, including Dulles Airport users. I-66 is free during those times for HOV-3+ drivers with an E-ZPass Flex and for motorcycles. Other drivers must pay a variable toll depending on current traffic levels. Outside of these hours, I-66 is free for all drivers to use.

=== Washington, D.C. ===
In Washington, D.C., the route quickly turns north, separating from US 50. The highway interchanges with the E Street Expressway spur before passing beneath Virginia and New Hampshire Avenues in a short tunnel, also running on the east side of the Watergate complex. After an indirect interchange with the Rock Creek and Potomac Parkway (via 27th Street), the highway terminates at a pair of ramps leading to the Whitehurst Freeway (US 29) and L Street. The portion of Interstate 66 within Washington, DC, is known as the Potomac River Freeway.

==== E Street Expressway ====
The E Street Expressway is a spur of I-66 that begins at an interchange with the Interstate just north of the Roosevelt Bridge. It proceeds east, has an interchange with Virginia Avenue Northwest, and terminates at 20th Street Northwest. From there, traffic continues along E Street Northwest to 17th Street Northwest near the White House, the Old Executive Office Building, George Washington University, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art. Westbound traffic from 17th Street takes a one-block segment of New York Avenue to the expressway entrance at 20th and E streets northwest. The expressway and the connecting portions of E Street and New York Avenue are part of the National Highway System.

In 1963, the construction of the E Street Expressway caused the demolition of multiple buildings of the Old Naval Observatory.

;Exit list
The entire route is in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood of Washington, D.C. All exits are unnumbered.


== History ==
=== Virginia ===

I-66 was first proposed in 1956 shortly after Congress established the Highway Trust Fund as a highway to connect Strasburg, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley with Washington, D.C..

During the planning stages, the Virginia Highway Department considered four possible locations for the highway inside the Beltway; in 1959, it settled on one that followed the Fairfax Drive–Bluemont Drive corridor between the Beltway and SR 120 (Glebe Road); and then along the Rosslyn Spur of the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad (W&amp;OD) between Glebe Road and Rosslyn in Arlington County. The route west of 123 was determined earlier. Two other routes through Arlington neighborhoods and one along Arlington Boulevard were rejected due to cost or opposition. I-66 was originally to connect to the Three Sisters Bridge, but, as that bridge was canceled, it was later designed to connect to the Potomac River Freeway via the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.

On December 16, 1961, the first piece of I-66, an section from US 29 at Gainesville to US 29 at Centreville was opened. A disconnected section near Delaplane in Fauquier County opened next in May 1962.

In July 1962, the highway department bought the Rosslyn Spur of the W&amp;OD for $900,000 (equivalent to $ in ) and began clearing the way, such that, by 1965, all that was left was dirt and the remains of 200 homes cleared for the highway. In February 1965, the state contracted to buy of the W&amp;OD from Herndon to Alexandria for $3.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, by then the owners of the line, petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to let them abandon it. The purchase would eliminate the need to build grade separation where the railroad crossed I-66 and would provide of right-of-way for the highway, saving the state millions. The abandonment proceedings took more than three years, as customers of the railway and transit advocates fought to keep the railroad open and delayed work on the highway. During that time, on November 10, 1967, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) announced that it had come to an agreement with the Highway Department that would give them a two-year option to buy a stretch of the right-of-way from Glebe Road to the Beltway, where I-66 was to be built, and run mass transit on the median of it. The W&amp;OD ran its last train during the summer of 1968, clearing the way for construction to begin in Arlington County.

While the state waited on the W&amp;OD, work continued elsewhere. The Theodore Roosevelt Bridge opened on June 23, 1964, and, in November of that year, the section from Centreville to the Beltway opened. A extension from the Roosevelt Bridge to Rosslyn opened in October 1966.

After the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT; then known as the Virginia Department of Highways) took possession of the mainline W&amp;OD right-of-way in 1968, they began to run into opposition as the highway revolts of the late 1960s and early 1970s took hold. In 1970, the Arlington County Board requested new hearings, and opponents began to organize marches. At the same time, the federal government wanted to pave the right-of-way from Washington Boulevard and Glebe Road to Rosslyn for an experimental busway, which Arlington County opposed, in part because they thought it might delay and add to the cost of I-66. A significant delay was encountered when the Arlington Coalition on Transportation (ACT) filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in 1971 opposing the Arlington County portion of the project. The group objected to that urban segment due to concerns over air quality, noise, unwanted traffic congestion, wasteful spending, impacts on mass transit, and wasted energy by auto travel. In 1972 the US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of ACT, technically blocking any construction. The US Supreme Court upheld the ruling in favor of ACT later that same year.

Again, work continued elsewhere, and, in October 1971, the section from I-81 to US 340/US 522 north of Front Royal opened.

In July 1974, a final environmental impact statement (EIS) was submitted. The EIS proposed an eight-lane limited access expressway from the Capital Beltway to the area near Spout Run Parkway. Six lanes would branch off at the Parkway and cross the Potomac River via a proposed Three Sisters Bridge. Another six lanes would branch off to the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. In November, a modified design was submitted, reducing the eight lanes to six. However, in 1975, VDOT disapproved the six-lane design.

The parties then agreed on experts to conduct air quality and noise studies for VDOT, selecting the firm of ESL Incorporated, the expert hired originally by ACT. In 1976, United States Secretary of Transportation William Thaddeus Coleman Jr. intervened. On January 4, 1977, Coleman approved federal aid for a much narrower, four-lane limited access highway between the Capital Beltway and the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge. As part of the deal, Virginia officials agreed to provide more than $100 million (equivalent to $ in ) in construction work and funds to help build the Metro system, which has tracks down the I-66 median to a station at Vienna in Fairfax County; to build a multiuse trail from Rosslyn to Falls Church; and to limit rush-hour traffic mainly to car pools. Three more lawsuits would follow, but work began on August 8, 1977, moments after US District Court Judge Owen R. Lewis denied an injunction sought by highway opponents.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the highway&#x27;s final miles were built. A section from Delaplane to US 17 east of Marshall was completed in two sections in 1978 and 1979. The section from US 340 to Delaplane was completed in August 1979. A section between US 17 in Marshall and US 15 in Haymarket opened in December 1979, with the gap between Haymarket and Gainesville closed on December 19, 1980. On December 22, 1982, the final section of I-66 opened between the Capital Beltway and US 29 (Lee Highway) in Rosslyn, near the Virginia end of the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge.

The Custis Trail, the trail along I-66 built between Rosslyn and Falls Church as a concession, opened in the summer of 1982, before the highway was complete. SR 267 (Dulles Access Road) between I-66 and the airport opened in 1984. The Metrorail in the median of I-66 between Ballston and Vienna, another concession, opened on June 7, 1986.

After opening, the restrictions on use began to loosen. In 1983, Virginia dropped the HOV requirement from 4 to 3 and then from 3 to 2 in 1994. In 1992, motorcycles were allowed.

On October 9, 1999, Public Law 106-69 transferred from the federal government to the Commonwealth of Virginia the authority for the operation, maintenance, and construction of I-66 between Rosslyn and the Capital Beltway.

Because I-66 is the only Interstate Highway traveling west from Washington, D.C., into Northern Virginia, traffic on the road is often extremely heavy. For decades, there has been talk of widening I-66 from two to three lanes each way inside the Capital Beltway (I-495) through Arlington County, Virginia, although many Arlington residents are adamantly opposed to this plan. In 2004–2005, Virginia studied options for widening the highway inside the Beltway, including the prospect of implementing a one-lane-plus-shoulder extension on westbound I-66 within the Beltway (in an attempt to reduce congestion for people commuting away from D.C.). They later settled on three planned &quot;spot improvements&quot; meant to ease traffic congestion on westbound I-66 inside the Capital Beltway. The first improvement, a zone between Fairfax Drive and Sycamore Street, started in summer 2010 and was finished in December 2011. For this project, the entrance ramp acceleration lane and the exit ramp deceleration lanes were lengthened to form a continuous lane between both ramps. The shoulder lane can carry emergency vehicles and can be used in emergency situations. The second one widened between the Washington Boulevard onramp and the ramp to the Dulles Access Road. Work on it began in 2013 and finished in 2015. The third project, between Lee Highway/Spout Run and Glebe Road, was completed in 2022.

In Gainesville, Virginia, the Gainesville Interchange Project upgraded the interchange between US 29 and I-66 for those and many other roads due to rapid development and accompanying heavy traffic in the Gainesville and Haymarket area. I-66&#x27;s overpasses were reconstructed to accommodate nine lanes (six general purpose, two HOV, and one collector–distributor eastbound) and lengthened for the expansion of US 29 to six lanes. These alterations were completed in June 2010. In 2014–2015, US 29 was largely grade-separated in the area, including an interchange at its current intersection with SR 619 (Linton Hall Road). The project began in 2004 and finished in 2015.

==== Transform 66 ====

The Virginia Department of Transportation announced its public-private partnership with the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation, and the private partner, I-66 Express Mobility Partners, with an estimating $3.7 billion dollars for transportation/road improvements along the I-66 corridor. The project, known as Transform 66, opened to traffic in November 2022 and the HOV rule changed from HOV-2+ to HOV-3+ in early December 2022.

=====Timeline=====

In 2015, the Virginia Department of Transportation planning board added I-66 HOT lanes to their list of priority projects for the I-66 corridor. The projects have sparked opposition between residents and community businesses over the direction of this region&#x27;s future infrastructure planning. The VDOT established a &quot;Transform 66&quot; website on regional traffic issues. Residents living within the I-66 corridor have set up &quot;Transform 66 Wisely&quot;, a website describing local community impacts that the VDOT projects may cause. Local business groups and Chambers of Commerce located near the affected areas, however, supported the improvements.

Residents along the I-66 corridor, such as in Arlington County, have resisted I-66 widening proposals for many years. The local Stenwood Elementary School would lose its attached field, leaving it with blacktop-only recess space. In an April 16, 2015, letter to the Virginia Secretary of Transportation, members of the 1st, 8th, 10th, and 11th districts of Congress wrote that VDOT research noted that, during peak hours, 35 percent of eastbound cars and 50 percent of westbound cars are HOV violators.

Future federal steps for VDOT include National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) review, obligation of federal funds, certification that the conversion to tolled facilities will not &quot;degrade&quot; the existing facility, and potential federal loan guarantee. The Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) is responsible for overseeing VDOT and allocating highway funding to specific projects. The board has 18 members appointed by the Governor, includes the Virginia Secretary of Transportation, Aubrey Layne, and is the group that will be making the final decision and allocating funding for VDOT&#x27;s plans for I-66.

In 2016, VDOT announced that it was planning to add express lanes and multimodal transportation improvements to I-66 outside the Beltway (the &quot;Transform 66 Outside the Beltway&quot; improvement project). A decision was also made to move forward with widening I-66 eastbound and make multimodal improvements from the Dulles Airport connector to Ballston, the &quot;Transform 66 Inside the Beltway&quot; improvement project.

VDOT also announced during 2016 that it would initiate on I-66 a dynamic tolling system in the peak travel directions during rush hours. On December 4, 2017, VDOT converted of I-66 between US 29 in Rosslyn and the Capital Beltway to an HOV variable congestion pricing tolling system. The system permits solo drivers to use I-66 during peak travel hours in the appropriate direction if they pay a toll.

VDOT designed the price of toll to keep traffic moving at a minimum of and to increase the capacity of the road. Carpools and vanpools (with three or more people), transit, on-duty law enforcement and first responders do not pay a toll. Prices were as high as $47 one-way during the lanes&#x27; first weeks of operations, attracting controversy and national media attention. The average speed during the morning rush hour was versus a year before. In 2023, VDOT reported that the average charge to travel the length of the tolled section was $6.31 in mornings and $5.10 in evenings. 0.04% of trips cost more than $40, and it was the first time that any trips at all had crossed that amount since 2020.

In 2017, construction began on the &quot;Transform 66 Outside the Beltway&quot; improvement project. The project added of new dynamically-tolled express lanes alongside I-66 from I-495 to University Boulevard in Gainesville. It also built new park and ride facilities, interchange improvements and of expanded multi-use trail. The project was completed in November 2022.

Construction on widening eastbound I-66 as part of the &quot;Transform 66 Inside the Beltway&quot; improvement project began in June 2018 and was completed in 2020. The project added a travel lane on eastbound I-66 between the Dulles Access Road and Fairfax Drive (exit 71) in Ballston, and provided a new ramp-to-ramp direct access connection from eastbound I-66 to the West Falls Church station at the SR 7 interchange and provided a new bridge for the W&amp;OD Trail over US 29.

VDOT completed in August 2018 a diverging diamond interchange in Haymarket at the interchange of I-66 with US 15.

===Washington, D.C.===
In Washington D.C., I-66 was planned to extend east of its current terminus along the North Leg of the Inner Loop freeway. I-66 would have also met the eastern terminus of the planned I-266 at US 29, and the western terminus of I-695 (South Leg Freeway) at US 50; I-266 would have been a parallel route to I-66, providing more direct access to the North Leg from points west, while I-695 would have been an inner-city connector between I-66 and I-95.

The final plans for the North Leg Freeway, published in 1971, outlined a six-lane tunnel beneath K Street, between I-266/US 29 and New York Avenue, where the North Leg would emerge from the tunnel and join with the Center Leg Freeway (formerly I-95, now I-395); the two routes would run concurrently for before reaching the Washington Union Station interchange, where I-66 was planned to terminate. Despite the plan to route the North Leg in a tunnel beneath K Street, the intense opposition to previous, scrapped alignments for the D.C. freeway network, which included previous alignments for the North Leg Freeway, led to the mass cancelation of all unbuilt D.C. freeways in 1977, resulting in the truncation of I-66 at US 29.
== 66 Parallel Trail ==
In 2023, as part of the Transform 66 - Outside the Beltway Project, a multi-use trail was built along the right-of-way from Gallows Road, located just outside the Beltway in Dunn Loring to a point just west of Rt. 28 in Centreville. The trail is actually four separate trails connected by a combination of on-road bike facilities and sidewalks. There are plans to extend the trail further west to Sudley Road in Prince William County. 

== Exit list ==
All exits in the District of Columbia are unnumbered.

















== Cancelled auxiliary route ==

Interstate 266 (I-266) was a proposed loop route of I-66 between Washington, D.C., and Arlington County, Virginia. D.C. officials proposed designating the route Interstate 66N, a move opposed by AASHTO. In Virginia, I-266 would have split off from I-66 just east of the present SR 124 (Spout Run Parkway) exit. From there, it would have followed an expanded Spout Run Parkway, crossed the George Washington Memorial Parkway, and crossed the Potomac River across a new bridge that would have been called the Three Sisters Bridge. Upon entering D.C., it would have followed Canal Road and an expanded US 29 (Whitehurst Freeway) to rejoin I-66 at K Street. I-266 was canceled in 1972 in the face of community opposition during Washington, D.C.&#x27;s freeway revolts.

<text>Robert Dennis Crumb (; born August 30, 1943) is an American cartoonist who often signs his work R. Crumb. His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.

Crumb contributed to many of the seminal works of the underground comix movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the &quot;East Village Other&quot; and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including countercultural icons Fritz the Cat and Mr. Natural, and the images from his &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot; strip. Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into scatological and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the &quot;Arcade&quot; anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily crosshatched pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, &quot;Weirdo&quot; (1981–1993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the alternative comics era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.

In 1991 Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame, and in 1994 the Terry Zwigoff film &quot;Crumb&quot; explored his artistic career and personal life. He was married to cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, with whom he frequently collaborated. Their daughter, Sophie Crumb, has also followed a cartooning career.

==Early life (1943–1966)==
Robert Crumb was born August 30, 1943, in Philadelphia to Catholic parents of English and Scottish descent, spending his early years in West Philadelphia and Upper Darby. His father, Charles Vincent Crumb, authored the book &quot;Training People Effectively&quot;. 

His mother, Beatrice Loretta Crumb ( Hall), was a housewife who reportedly abused diet pills and amphetamines. Crumb&#x27;s parents&#x27; marriage was unhappy and the children were frequent witnesses to their parents&#x27; arguments. The couple had four other children: sons Charles Vincent Crumb Jr. and Maxon Crumb, both of whom suffered from mental illness, and daughters Carol and Sandra. The family often moved between Philadelphia and Charles&#x27;s hometown, Albert Lea, Minnesota. In August 1950, the Crumbs moved to Ames, Iowa. For two years, Charles, a Marine Corps sergeant, was an instructor in the Naval R.O.T.C. program at Iowa State College. The family moved to Milford, Delaware, when Crumb was twelve and where he was an average student whose teachers discouraged him from cartooning.

Inspired by Walt Kelly, Fleischer Brothers animation and others, Crumb and his brothers drew their own comics. His cartooning developed as his older brother Charles pushed him and provided feedback. In 1958 the brothers self-published three issues of &quot;Foo&quot; in imitation of Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s satirical &quot;Humbug&quot; and &quot;Mad&quot; which they sold door-to-door with little success, souring the young Crumb on the comic-book business. At fifteen, Crumb collected classical jazz and blues records from the 1920s to the 1940s. At age 16 he lost his Catholic faith.

==Career==

===Early work (1962–1966)===

Crumb&#x27;s father gave him $40 when he left home after high school. His first job, in 1962, was drawing novelty greeting cards for American Greetings in Cleveland, Ohio. He stayed with the company for four years, producing hundreds of cards for the company&#x27;s Hi-Brow line; his superiors had him draw in a cuter style that was to leave a footprint on his work throughout his career. 

In Cleveland, he met a group of young bohemians such as Buzzy Linhart, Liz Johnston, and Harvey Pekar. Dissatisfied with greeting card work, he tried to sell cartoons to comic book companies, who showed little interest in his work. In 1965, cartoonist Harvey Kurtzman printed some of Crumb&#x27;s work in the humor magazine he edited, &quot;Help!&quot; Crumb moved to New York, intending to work with Kurtzman, but &quot;Help!&quot; ceased publication shortly after. Crumb briefly illustrated bubblegum cards for Topps before returning to Cleveland and American Greetings.

Crumb married Dana Morgan in 1964. Nearly destitute, the couple traveled in Europe, during which Crumb continued to produce work for Kurtzman and American Greetings, and Dana stole food. The relationship was unstable as Crumb frequently went his own way, and he was not close to his son, Jesse (born in 1968).
In 1965 and 1966 Crumb had a number of Fritz the Cat strips published in the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Cavalier&quot;. Fritz had appeared in Crumb&#x27;s work as early as the late 1950s; he was to become a hipster, scam artist, and bohemian until Crumb abandoned the character in 1969.

Crumb was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with his job and marriage when in June 1965 he began taking LSD, a psychedelic drug that was then still legal. He had both good and bad trips. One bad trip left him in a muddled state for half a year, during which for a time he left Dana; the state ended when the two took a strong dose of the drug together in April 1966. Crumb created a number of his best-known characters during his years of LSD use, including Mr. Natural, Angelfood McSpade, and the Snoid. His work in the underground comics scene coincided with the rise of Timothy Leary&#x27;s acid tests and psychedelics generally which led to deals with psychedelic artists such as the Grateful Dead.

===&quot;Zap&quot; and (1967–1979)===

In January 1967 Crumb came across two friends in a bar who were about to leave for San Francisco; Crumb was interested in the work of San Francisco-based psychedelic poster artists, and on a whim asked if he could join them. There, he contributed upbeat LSD-inspired countercultural work to underground newspapers. The work was popular, and Crumb was flooded with requests, including to illustrate a full issue of Philadelphia&#x27;s &quot;Yarrowstalks&quot;.

Independent publisher Don Donahue invited Crumb to make a comic book; Crumb drew up two issues of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;, and Donahue published the first in February 1968 under the publisher name Apex Novelties. Crumb had difficulty at first finding retailers who would stock it, and at first his wife took to selling the first run herself out of a baby carriage.

Crumb met cartoonist S. Clay Wilson, an art school graduate who saw himself as a rebel against middle-class American values and whose comics were violent and grotesque. Wilson&#x27;s attitude inspired Crumb to give up the idea of the cartoonist-as-entertainer and to focus on comics as open, uncensored self-expression; in particular, his work soon became sexually explicit, as in the pornographic &quot;Snatch&quot; he and Wilson produced late in 1968.

The second issue of &quot;Zap&quot; appeared in June with contributions from Wilson and poster artists Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. Artist H.Fish also contributed to &quot;Zap&quot;. In December, Donahue published the still-unreleased issue as 0 and a new third issue with Gilbert Shelton joining the roster of regulars. &quot;Zap&quot; was financially successful, and developed a market for underground comix.

Crumb was a prolific cartoonist in the late 1960s and early 1970s; at his peak output he produced 320 pages over two years. He produced much of his best-known work then, including his &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot; strip, and strips featuring characters such as the bohemian Fritz the Cat, spiritual guru Mr. Natural, and oversexed African-American stereotype Angelfood McSpade. During this period, he launched a series of solo titles, including &quot;Despair&quot;, &quot;Uneeda&quot; (published by Print Mint in 1969 and 1970 respectively), &quot;Big Ass Comics&quot;, &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot;, &quot;Motor City Comics&quot; (all published by Rip Off Press in 1969), &quot;Home Grown Funnies&quot; (Kitchen Sink Press, 1971) and &quot;Hytone Comix&quot; (Apex Novelties, 1971), in addition to founding the pornographic anthologies &quot;Jiz&quot; and &quot;Snatch&quot; (both Apex Novelties, 1969).

Crumb&#x27;s work also appeared in &quot;Nasty Tales&quot;, a 1970s British underground comic. The publishers were acquitted in a celebrated 1972 obscenity trial at the Old Bailey in London; the first such case involving a comic. Giving evidence at the trial, one of the defendants said of Crumb: &quot;He is the most outstanding, certainly the most interesting, artist to appear from the underground, and this (Dirty Dog) is Rabelaisian satire of a very high order. He is using coarseness quite deliberately in order to get across a view of social hypocrisy.&quot;

===&quot;Weirdo&quot; (1980–1993)===

While meditating in 1980, Crumb conceived of a magazine with a lowbrow aesthetic inspired by punk zines, &quot;Mad&quot;, and men&#x27;s magazines of the 1940s and 1950s. From 1981 Crumb edited the first nine issues of the twenty-eight issue run of &quot;Weirdo&quot;, published by Last Gasp; his contributions and tastes determined the contents of the later issues as well, edited by Peter Bagge until 17, and Aline for the remainder of the run. The magazine featured cartoonists new and old, and had a mixed response. Crumb&#x27;s fumetti was so unpopular that it has never appeared in Crumb collections.

===Later life (1994–present)===
The Crumbs moved into a house in Sauve (Gard, southern France) in 1991, which is said to have been financed by the sale of six Crumb sketchbooks. The documentary &quot;Crumb&quot;, directed by Terry Zwigoff, appeared in 1994—a project on which Zwigoff had been working since 1985. The film won several major critical accolades.

From 1987 to 2005 Fantagraphics Books published the seventeen-volume &quot;Complete Crumb Comics&quot; and ten volumes of sketches. Crumb (as &quot;R. Crumb&quot;) contributes regularly to &quot;Mineshaft&quot; magazine, which, since 2009, has been serializing &quot;Excerpts From R. Crumb&#x27;s Dream Diary&quot;.

In 2009 Crumb produced &quot;The Book of Genesis&quot;, an unabridged illustrated graphic novel version of the biblical Book of Genesis. In 2016, the Seattle Museum of Art displayed the original drawings for &quot;The Book of Genesis&quot; as part of an exhibit entitled &quot;Graphic Masters: Dürer, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Goya, Picasso, R. Crumb.&quot;

In January 2015, Crumb was asked to submit a cartoon to the left-wing magazine &quot;Libération&quot; as a tribute for the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting. He sent a drawing titled &quot;A Cowardly Cartoonist&quot;, depicting an illustration of the backside of &quot;Mohamid Bakhsh&quot;, a reference to Muhammad, founder of Islam, and Ralph Bakshi, who directed the film adaptation &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1972).

===Professional collaborations===
A friend of comic book writer Harvey Pekar, Crumb illustrated over 30 stories of Pekar&#x27;s in the comic book series &quot;American Splendor&quot;, primarily in the first eight issues (1976–1983). As &quot;The Complete Crumb Comics&quot; co-editor Robert Fiore wrote about their collaborations:
Crumb collaborated with his wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, on many strips and comics, including &quot;Dirty Laundry Comics&quot;, &quot;Self-Loathing Comics&quot;, and work published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

In 1978, Crumb allowed his artwork to be used as pictorial rubber stamp designs by Top Drawer Rubber Stamp Company, a collaboration between cartoonist Art Spiegelman, publisher Françoise Mouly, and people living at Quarry Hill Creative Center in Rochester, Vermont. R. Crumb&#x27;s imagery proved to be some of the most popular designs produced by this avant-garde pictorial stamp company.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Crumb illustrated a number of writer Charles Bukowski&#x27;s stories, including the collection &quot;The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship&quot; and the story &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot;.

In 1984–1985 Crumb produced a series of illustrations for the tenth anniversary edition of Edward Abbey&#x27;s environmental-themed novel &quot;The Monkey Wrench Gang&quot;, published in 1985 by Dream Garden Press of Salt Lake City. Many of these illustrations also appeared in a 1987 Monkey Wrench Gang calendar, and remain available on T-shirts.

&quot;R. Crumb Comix&quot;, a theatrical production based on his work and directed by Johnny Simons, was produced in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1986. It was revived at Duke University in 1990, and co-starred Avner Eisenberg. The development of the play was supervised by Crumb, who also served as set designer, drawing larger-than-life representations of some of his most famous characters all over the floors and walls of the set.

Crumb&#x27;s collaboration with David Zane Mairowitz, the illustrated, part-comic biography and bibliography &quot;Introducing Kafka&quot; (1993), a.k.a. &quot;Kafka for Beginners&quot;, is one of his less sexual- and satire-oriented, comparably highbrow works. It is well-known and favorably received, and due to its popularity was republished as &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Kafka&quot;.

===Musical projects===

Crumb has frequently drawn comics about his musical interests in blues, country, bluegrass, cajun, French Bal-musette, jazz, big band and swing music from the 1920s and 1930s, and they also heavily influenced the soundtrack choices for his bandmate Zwigoff&#x27;s 1995 &quot;Crumb&quot; documentary. In 2006, he prepared, compiled and illustrated the book &quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Heroes of Blues, Jazz &amp; Country&quot;, with accompanying CD, which derived from three series of trading cards originally published in the 1980s.

Crumb was the leader of the band R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders, for which he sang lead vocals, wrote several songs and played banjo and other instruments. Crumb often plays mandolin with Eden and John&#x27;s East River String Band and has drawn four covers for them: 2009&#x27;s &quot;Drunken Barrel House Blues&quot;, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Some Cold Rainy Day&quot;, 2011&#x27;s &quot;Be Kind To A Man When He&#x27;s Down&quot; on which he plays mandolin, the latest (2022) &quot;Goodbye Cruel World&quot;, on which he sings vocals, plays ukulele, mandolin &amp; tiple. In 2013 he played on their album &quot;Take A Look at That Baby&quot; and also took part in the accompanying music video.

With Dominique Cravic, in 1986 he founded &quot;Les Primitifs du Futur&quot;—a French band whose eclectic music has incorporated Bal-musette, folk, jazz, blues and world music—playing on their albums &quot;Cocktail d&#x27;Amour&quot; (1986), &quot;Trop de Routes, Trop de Trains&quot; (1995), &quot;World Musette&quot; (1999) and &quot;Tribal Musette&quot; (2008). He also provided the cover art for these albums.

Crumb has released CDs anthologizing old original performances gleaned from collectible 78-rpm phonograph records. His &quot;That&#x27;s What I Call Sweet Music&quot; was released in 1999 and &quot;Hot Women: Women Singers from the Torrid Regions&quot; in 2009. &quot;Chimpin&#x27; the Blues,&quot; a collaboration with fellow record collector Jerry Zolten that combines rare recordings with conversation about the music and the musicians, was released in 2013. Crumb drew the cover art for these CDs as well.

===Album covers===

Crumb has illustrated many album covers, most prominently &quot;Cheap Thrills&quot; by Big Brother and the Holding Company and the compilation album &quot;The Music Never Stopped: Roots of the Grateful Dead&quot;.

Between 1974 and 1984, Crumb drew at least 17 album covers for Yazoo Records/Blue Goose Records, including those of the Cheap Suit Serenaders. He also created the revised logo and record label designs of Blue Goose Records that were used from 1974 onward.

In 1992 and 1993, Robert Crumb was involved in a project by Dutch formation the Beau Hunks and provided the cover art for both their albums &quot;The Beau Hunks play the original Laurel &amp; Hardy music&quot; 1 and 2. He also illustrated the albums&#x27; booklets.

In 2009, Crumb drew the artwork for a 10-CD anthology of French traditional music compiled by Guillaume Veillet for . The following year, he created three artworks for Christopher King&#x27;s &quot;Aimer Et Perdre: To Love And To Lose: Songs, 1917–1934&quot;.

== Style ==

As told by Crumb in his biographical film, his artwork was very conventional and traditional in the beginning. His earlier work shows this more restrained style. In Crumb&#x27;s own words, it was a lengthy drug trip on LSD that &quot;left him fuzzy for two months&quot; and led to him adopting the surrealistic, psychedelic style for which he has become known.

A peer in the underground comics field, Victor Moscoso, commented about his first impression of Crumb&#x27;s work, in the mid-1960s, before meeting Crumb in person: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was an old man drawing young, or a young man drawing old.&quot; Robert Crumb&#x27;s cartooning style has drawn on the work of cartoon artists from earlier generations, including Billy DeBeck (Barney Google), C. E. Brock (an old story book illustrator), Gene Ahern&#x27;s comic strips, Basil Wolverton (Powerhouse Pepper), George Baker (&quot;Sad Sack&quot;), Ub Iwerks&#x27;s characters for animation, Isadore Freleng&#x27;s drawings for the early &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; of the 1930s, Sidney Smith (&quot;The Gumps&quot;), Rube Goldberg, E. C. Segar (Popeye) and Bud Fisher (&quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;). Crumb has cited Carl Barks, who illustrated Disney&#x27;s &quot;Donald Duck&quot; comic books, and John Stanley (&quot;Little Lulu&quot;) as formative influences on his narrative approach, as well as Harvey Kurtzman of &quot;Mad&quot; Magazine fame.

After issues 0 and 1 of &quot;Zap&quot;, Crumb began working with others, of whom the first was S. Clay Wilson. Crumb said, about when he first saw Wilson&#x27;s work &quot;The content was something like I&#x27;d never seen before, ... a nightmare vision of hell-on-earth ...&quot; And &quot;Suddenly my own work seemed insipid ...&quot;

Crumb remains a prominent figure, as both artist and influence, within the alternative comics milieu. He is hailed as a genius by such comic book talents as Jaime Hernandez, Daniel Clowes, and Chris Ware. In the fall of 2008, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia hosted a major exhibition of his work, which was favorably reviewed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;.

==Awards and honors==

Crumb has received several accolades for his work, including the Inkpot Award in 1989, a nomination for the Harvey Special Award for Humor in 1990 and the Angoulême Grand Prix in 1999.

In 1991 Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.

With Jack Kirby, Will Eisner, Harvey Kurtzman, Gary Panter, and Chris Ware, Crumb was among the artists honored in the exhibition &quot;Masters of American Comics&quot; at the Jewish Museum in New York City, from September 16, 2006, to January 28, 2007.

In 2017, Crumb&#x27;s original cover art for the 1969 &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; collection published by Ballantine sold at auction for $717,000, the highest sale price to that point for any piece of American cartoon art.

== In the media ==
In addition to numerous brief television reports, there are at least three television or theatrical documentaries dedicated to Crumb.

* Prior to the 1972 release of the film version of &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;, Austrian journalist Georg Stefan Troller interviewed Crumb for a thirty-minute documentary entitled &quot;Comics und Katerideen&quot; on Crumb&#x27;s life and artwhich he describes as &quot;the epitome of contemporary white North America&#x27;s popular art&quot;as an episode of his &quot;Personenbeschreibung&quot; (literally &quot;Person&#x27;s description&quot;) documentary-format broadcast on the German TV network ZDF. The documentary also includes a &quot;making-of&quot; look at the then forthcoming &quot;Fritz&quot; movie, featuring production background interviews with Ralph Bakshi. By the mid-to-late 2000s, it could still be seen on rotation as part of the &quot;Personenbeschreibung&quot; series on the ZDF-owned digital specialty channel &quot;ZDFdokukanal&quot; (in 2009 replaced by the new channel ZDFneo).
* &quot;Arena&quot;: &quot;The Confessions of Robert Crumb&quot; (BBC Two, 13 February 1987)
* &quot;Crumb&quot; (1994), a documentary film by Terry Zwigoff

Crumb and his work are featured in Ron Mann&#x27;s &quot;Comic Book Confidential&quot; (1988).

In the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the name (and aspects of the appearance) of the character Salacious B. Crumb are derived from, and are an homage to, Crumb.

In the 2003 movie &quot;American Splendor&quot;, Crumb was portrayed by James Urbaniak. Crumb&#x27;s wife Aline was quoted as saying she hated the interpretation and never would have married Robert if he was like that.

In 2005, Crumb brought legal action against Amazon.com after their website used a version of his widely recognizable &quot;Keep On Truckin&#x27;&quot; character. The case was expected to be settled out of court.

Underground rap artist Aesop Rock mentions Crumb several times in his lyrics, including in the songs &quot;Catacomb Kids&quot; from the album &quot;None Shall Pass&quot; and &quot;Nickel Plated Pockets&quot; from his EP &quot;Daylight&quot;.

&quot;R. Crumb&#x27;s Sex Obsessions&quot;, a collection of his most personally revealing sexually oriented drawings and comic strips, was released by Taschen Publishing in November 2007. In August 2011, following concerns about his safety, Crumb cancelled plans to visit the Graphic 2011 festival in Sydney, Australia, after a tabloid labeled him a &quot;self-confessed sex pervert&quot; in an article headlined &quot;Cult genius or filthy weirdo?&quot;

In 2012, Crumb appeared on &quot;John&#x27;s Old Time Radio Show&quot;, talking about old music, sex, aliens and Bigfoot. He also played 78-rpm records from his record room in southern France. He has appeared on the show and recorded at least fourteen one-hour podcasts.

==Personal life==
Crumb has been married twice. He first married Dana Morgan in 1964, who gave birth to their son Jesse in 1968. Crumb met cartoonist Aline Kominsky in 1972; their relationship soon turned serious and they began living together (on the same property shared by Dana Crumb). In 1978, Crumb divorced Dana and married Aline, with whom Crumb has frequently collaborated. In September 1981 Aline gave birth to Crumb&#x27;s second child, Sophie. Robert, Aline, and Sophie moved to a small village near Sauve in southern France in 1991. Dana died in 2014. Aline died in 2022.

At age six, Crumb&#x27;s son was featured as a character in Robert and Aline&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Laundry Comics&quot; #1 (Cartoonists Co-Op Press, 1974); he also appeared as an adult in Terry Zwigoff&#x27;s 1994 documentary film, &quot;Crumb&quot;. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, December 31, 2017, Crumb&#x27;s son was seriously injured in a car crash near Phillipsville, California, and died three days later; he was 49 years old. 

Crumb was a member of the Church of the SubGenius.

== Critical reception ==
Crumb has frequently been the target of criticism due to his recurring themes of graphic sexual and violent abuse of women. Crumb himself has frequently admitted his insecurity and hostility in relation to women:
In addition to being the target of speculation by critical theorists and academic researchers, Crumb has also been held to scrutiny, by feminist writer Deirdre English. English has been quoted as saying that Crumb engages in &quot;self-indulgent fantasies&quot; through his work, continually blurring the line between entertainment and pornography.

He has been the target of criticism by colleagues as well, such as Trina Robbins, who called Crumb a &quot;sexist pig&quot; due to his sexual hostility towards women.

Crumb&#x27;s work is also filled with unsavory images of African Americans (such as his recurring character Angelfood McSpade), who are often portrayed as indigent, tribal, and caricatured. Crumb often utilized African American characters as &quot;tokens&quot;, appearing as re-used tropes such as clowns, tribesmen, athletes, etc. Researcher Edward Shannon interpreted the themes of Crumb&#x27;s story containing marginalized Africans in &quot;When the Niggers Take Over America&quot; (published in 1993 in &quot;Weirdo&quot;) like this: &quot;Crumb ... explores both the American Dream and its nightmare reflection; in this ... strip &quot;all-American&quot; white middle class children are depicted as cannibals eager to devour the devalued and dehumanized &quot;other.&quot;&quot; Crumb has responded to criticism by claiming that he did not invent racist caricature, but that they were part of the American culture in which he was raised. He sees his art as a criticism of the racist stereotype itself and assumed that the audience who read his work in the late 1960s were not racists and would understand his intentions.

<doc id="92441" wikidata="Q412272" url="?curid=92441" title="Proton pump">
<text>A proton pump is an integral membrane protein pump that builds up a proton gradient across a biological membrane. Proton pumps catalyze the following reaction:

:[on one side of a biological membrane] + energy [on the other side of the membrane]

Mechanisms are based on energy-induced conformational changes of the protein structure or on the Q cycle.

During evolution, proton pumps have arisen independently on multiple occasions. Thus, not only throughout nature, but also within single cells, different proton pumps that are evolutionarily unrelated can be found. Proton pumps are divided into different major classes of pumps that use different sources of energy, exhibiting different polypeptide compositions and evolutionary origins.

==Function==
Transport of the positively charged proton is typically electrogenic, i.e.: it generates an electric field across the membrane also called the membrane potential. Proton transport becomes electrogenic if not neutralized electrically by transport of either a corresponding negative charge in the same direction or a corresponding positive charge in the opposite direction. An example of a proton pump that is not electrogenic, is the proton/potassium pump of the gastric mucosa which catalyzes a balanced exchange of protons and potassium ions.

The combined transmembrane gradient of protons and charges created by proton pumps is called an electrochemical gradient. An electrochemical gradient represents a store of energy (potential energy) that can be used to drive a multitude of biological processes such as ATP synthesis, nutrient uptake and action potential formation.

In cell respiration, the proton pump uses energy to transport protons from the matrix of the mitochondrion to the inter-membrane space. It is an active pump that generates a proton concentration gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane, because there are more protons outside the matrix than inside. The difference in pH and electric charge (ignoring differences in buffer capacity) creates an electrochemical potential difference that works similar to that of a battery or energy storing unit for the cell.
The process could also be seen as analogous to cycling uphill or charging a battery for later use, as it produces potential energy. The proton pump does not create energy, but forms a gradient that stores energy for later use.

==Diversity==
The energy required for the proton pumping reaction may come from light (light energy; bacteriorhodopsins), electron transfer (electrical energy; electron transport complexes I, III and IV) or energy-rich metabolites (chemical energy) such as pyrophosphate (PPi; proton-pumping pyrophosphatase) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP; proton ATPases).

==Electron-transport-driven proton pumps==

===Electron transport complex I===
Complex I (EC 1.6.5.3) (also referred to as NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase or, especially in the context of the human protein, NADH dehydrogenase) is a proton pump driven by electron transport. It belongs to the H+ or Na+-translocating NADH Dehydrogenase (NDH) Family (TC# 3.D.1), a member of the Na+ transporting Mrp superfamily. It the transfer of electrons from NADH to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and, in eukaryotes, it is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme helps to establish a transmembrane difference of proton electrochemical potential that the ATP synthase then uses to synthesize ATP.

===Electron transport complex III===
Complex III (EC 1.10.2.2) (also referred to as cytochrome bc1 or the coenzyme Q : cytochrome c – oxidoreductase) is a proton pump driven by electron transport. Complex III is a multi-subunit transmembrane protein encoded by both the mitochondrial (cytochrome b) and the nuclear genomes (all other subunits). Complex III is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of all aerobic eukaryotes and the inner membranes of most eubacteria. This enzyme helps to establish a transmembrane difference of proton electrochemical potential that the ATP synthase of mitochondria then uses to synthesize ATP.

===The cytochrome b6f complex===
The cytochrome b6f complex (EC 1.10.99.1) (also called plastoquinol—plastocyanin reductase) is an enzyme related to Complex III but found in the thylakoid membrane in chloroplasts of plants, cyanobacteria, and green algae. This proton pump is driven by electron transport and catalyzes the transfer of electrons from plastoquinol to plastocyanin. The reaction is analogous to the reaction catalyzed by Complex III (cytochrome bc1) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This enzyme helps to establish a transmembrane difference of proton electrochemical potential that the ATP synthase of chloroplasts then uses to synthesize ATP.

===Electron transport complex IV===
Complex IV (EC 1.9.3.1) (also referred to as cytochrome c oxidase), is a proton pump driven by electron transport. This enzyme is a large transmembrane protein complex found in bacteria and inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes. It receives an electron from each of four cytochrome c molecules, and transfers them to one oxygen molecule, converting molecular oxygen to two molecules of water. In the process, it binds four protons from the inner aqueous phase to make water and in addition four protons across the membrane. This enzyme helps to establish a transmembrane difference of proton electrochemical potential that the ATP synthase of mitochondria then uses to synthesize ATP.

==ATP-driven proton pumps==
Proton pumps driven by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (also referred to as proton ATPases or -ATPases) are proton pumps driven by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Three classes of proton ATPases are found in nature. In a single cell (for example those of fungi and plants), representatives from all three groups of proton ATPases may be present.

===P-type proton ATPase===
The plasma membrane -ATPase is a single subunit P-type ATPase found in the plasma membrane of plants, fungi, protists and many prokaryotes.

The plasma membrane -ATPase creates the electrochemical gradients in the plasma membrane of plants, fungi, protists, and many prokaryotes. Here, proton gradients are used to drive secondary transport processes. As such, it is essential for the uptake of most metabolites, and also for responses to the environment (e.g., movement of leaves in plants).

Humans (and probably other mammals) have a gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase or H+/K+ ATPase that also belongs to the P-type ATPase family. This enzyme functions as the proton pump of the stomach, primarily responsible for the acidification of the stomach contents (see gastric acid).

===V-type proton ATPase===
The V-type proton ATPase is a multi-subunit enzyme of the V-type. It is found in various different membranes where it serves to acidify intracellular organelles or the cell exterior.

===F-type proton ATPase===
The F-type proton ATPase is a multi-subunit enzyme of the F-type (also referred to as ATP synthase or FOF1 ATPase). It is found in the mitochondrial inner membrane where it functions as a proton transport-driven ATP synthase.

In mitochondria, reducing equivalents provided by electron transfer or photosynthesis power this translocation of protons. For example, the translocation of protons by cytochrome c oxidase is powered by reducing equivalents provided by reduced cytochrome c. ATP itself powers this transport in the plasma membrane proton ATPase and in the ATPase proton pumps of other cellular membranes.

The FoF1 ATP synthase of mitochondria, in contrast, usually conduct protons from high to low concentration across the membrane while drawing energy from this flow to synthesize ATP. Protons translocate across the inner mitochondrial membrane via proton wire. This series of conformational changes, channeled through the a and b subunits of the FO particle, drives a series of conformational changes in the stalk connecting the FO to the F1 subunit. This process effectively couples the translocation of protons to the mechanical motion between the Loose, Tight, and Open states of F1 necessary to phosphorylate ADP.

In bacteria and ATP-producing organelles other than mitochondria, reducing equivalents provided by electron transfer or photosynthesis power the translocation of protons.

CF1 ATP ligase of chloroplasts correspond to the human FOF1 ATP synthase in plants.

==Pyrophosphate driven proton pumps==
Proton pumping pyrophosphatase (also referred to as H-PPase or vacuolar-type inorganic pyrophosphatases (V-PPase; V is for vacuolar)) is a proton pump driven by the hydrolysis of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). In plants, H-PPase is localized to the vacuolar membrane (the tonoplast). This membrane of plants contains two different proton pumps for acidifying the interior of the vacuole, the V-PPase and the V-ATPase.

==Light driven proton pumps==
Bacteriorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump used by Archaea, most notably in Haloarchaea. Light is absorbed by a retinal pigment covalently linked to the protein, that results in a conformational change of the molecule that is transmitted to the pump protein associated with proton pumping.

<doc id="92443" wikidata="Q41185" url="?curid=92443" title="Caen">
<text>Caen (; ; ) is a commune inland from the northwestern coast of France. It is the prefecture of the department of Calvados. The city proper has 105,512 inhabitants (), while its functional urban area has 470,000, making Caen the second largest urban area in Normandy and the 19th largest in France. It is also the third largest commune in all of Normandy after Le Havre and Rouen.

It is located northwest of Paris, connected to the South of England by the Caen (Ouistreham) to Portsmouth ferry route through the English Channel. Situated a few miles from the coast, the landing beaches, the bustling resorts of Deauville and Cabourg, as well as Norman Switzerland and the Pays d&#x27;Auge, Caen is often considered the archetype of Normandy.

Caen is known for its historical buildings built during the reign of William the Conqueror, who was buried there, and for the Battle for Caen, heavy fighting that took place in and around Caen during the Battle of Normandy in 1944, destroying much of the city. The city has now preserved the memory by erecting a memorial and a museum dedicated to peace, the Mémorial de Caen.

==Etymology==
The first references to the name of Caen are found in different acts of the dukes of Normandy: &quot;Cadon&quot; 1021/1025, &quot;Cadumus&quot; 1025, &quot;Cathim&quot; 1026/1027. Year 1070 of the Parker manuscript of the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; refers to Caen as &quot;Kadum&quot;, and year 1086 of the Laud manuscript gives the name as &quot;Caþum&quot;. Despite a lack of sources as to the origin of the settlements, the name Caen would seem to be of Gaulish origin, from the words &quot;catu-&quot;, referring to military activities and &quot;magos&quot;, field, hence meaning &quot;manoeuvre field&quot; or &quot;battlefield&quot;. In Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, the poet asserts that King Arthur named the city in memory of Sir Kay, although the historicity of King Arthur is widely doubted.

==History==
===Early history===
Caen was known in Roman times as &#x27;Catumagos&#x27;, from the Gaulish roots &quot;magos&quot; meaning &#x27;field&#x27; and &quot;catu&quot; meaning &#x27;combat&#x27;. It remained a minor settlement throughout the Roman period and began to see major development commence in the 10th century, under the patronage of the Dukes of Normandy. Around 1060, William the Conqueror began construction of the Château de Caen, which became the centre of the ducal court. Duchess Matilda of Flanders also founded the Benedictine Abbey of Sainte-Trinité, Caen around the same time, eventually being buried in the abbey. Caen succeeded Bayeux as the capital of Lower Normandy, complementing the second ducal capital of Rouen.

Caen fell to Philip II of France on 21 May 1204, and was incorporated along with the remainder of Normandy into the Kingdom of France.

===Hundred Years&#x27; War===

In 1346, King Edward III of England led his army against the city, hoping to loot it. It was expected that a siege of perhaps several weeks would be required, but the army took the city in less than a day, on 26 July 1346, storming and sacking it, killing 3,000 of its citizens, and burning much of the merchants&#x27; quarter on the Île St-Jean. Only the castle of Caen held out, despite attempts to besiege it. A few days later, the English left, marching to the east and on to their victory at the Battle of Crécy. It was later captured following a siege by Henry V in 1417 and treated harshly for being the first town to put up any resistance to his invasion. In 1450 towards the end of the war, French forces recaptured Caen.

===World War II===

During World War II, Caen was captured by German forces during the Battle of France in 1940 and placed under military occupation. In 1944, Allied forces launched Operation Overlord, invading German-occupied France and rapidly advancing through Normandy. From 6 June to 6 August 1944, the British Second Army fought the battle of Caen to dislodge German forces from the city. During the battle, Allied bombing raids heavily damaged the city and caused numerous French civilian casualties. After the battle, little of prewar Caen remained, and reconstruction efforts in the city continued until 1962.

===Postwar===
Postwar work included the reconstruction of complete districts of the city and the university campus. It took 14 years (1948–1962) and led to the current urbanization of Caen. Having lost many of its historic quarters and its university campus in the war, Caen does not have the atmosphere of a traditional Norman town such as Honfleur, Rouen, Cabourg, Deauville or Bayeux. 

The Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit filmed the D-Day offensive and Orne breakout several weeks later. It returned several months later to document the city&#x27;s recovery efforts. The resulting film, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Kill a City&quot;, is preserved in the National Archives of Canada.
==Geography==
Caen is in an area of high humidity. The river Orne flows through the city, as well as small rivers known as &quot;les Odons&quot;, most of which have been buried under the city to improve urban hygiene. Caen has a large flood zone, named &quot;La prairie&quot;, located around the hippodrome, not far from the river Orne, which is regularly submerged.

Caen is from the Channel. A canal (Canal de Caen à la Mer) parallel to the Orne was built during the reign of Napoleon III to link the city to the sea at all times. The canal reaches the English Channel at Ouistreham. A lock keeps the tide out of the canal and lets large ships navigate up the canal to Caen&#x27;s freshwater harbours.

===Climate===
Caen has an oceanic climate that is somewhat ameliorated due to its slightly inland position. In spite of this, summers are still cool by French standards and the climate is typically maritime in terms of high precipitation, relatively modest sunshine hours and mild winters.
==Population==

The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Caen proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Caen absorbed the former commune of Venoix in 1952.
==Main sights==
===Castle===
The castle, &quot;Château de Caen&quot;, built by William the Conqueror, who successfully conquered England in 1066, is one of the largest medieval fortresses of Western Europe. It remained an essential feature of Norman strategy and policy. At Christmas 1182, a royal court celebration for Christmas in the of Caen Castle brought together Henry II and his sons, Richard the Lionheart and John Lackland, receiving more than a thousand knights. Caen Castle, along with all of Normandy, was handed over to the French Crown in 1204. The castle saw several engagements during the Hundred Years&#x27; War (1346, 1417, 1450) and was in use as a barracks as late as the Second World War. Bullet holes are visible on the walls of the castle where members of the French Resistance were shot during the Second World War. Today, the castle serves as a museum that houses the &quot;Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts of Caen) and &quot;Musée de Normandie&quot; (Museum of Normandy) along with many periodical exhibitions about arts and history. (See )

===Abbeys===
In repentance for marrying his cousin Mathilda of Flanders, William ordered two abbeys to be built on the Pope&#x27;s encouragement:
*Église St.-Étienne, formerly the &quot;Abbaye aux Hommes&quot; (Men&#x27;s Abbey). It was completed in 1063 and is dedicated to St Stephen. The current Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) of Caen is built onto the South Transept of the building.
*&quot;Église de la Ste.-Trinité&quot;, formerly the &quot;Abbaye aux Dames&quot; (Women&#x27;s Abbey). It was completed in 1060 and is dedicated to the Holy Trinity. The current seat of the regional council (&quot;conseil régional&quot;) of Basse-Normandie is nearby.

===Others===
*Jardin botanique de Caen, a historic botanical garden
*Church of Saint-Pierre
*Church of Saint-Étienne-le-Vieux

It is an emotional presentation inviting meditation on the thought of Elie Wiesel: &quot;Peace is not a gift from God to man, but a gift from man to himself&quot;. The Memorial for Peace also includes an exhibit of Nobel Peace Prize winners and another one on Conflict Resolution in different cultures.

In 1952, the small commune of Venoix became part of Caen.

In 1990, the agglomeration of Caen was organized into a district, transformed in 2002 into a &quot;Communauté d&#x27;agglomération&quot; (&quot;Grand Caen&quot; (Greater Caen), renamed Caen la Mer in 2004), gathers 29 towns and villages, including Villons-les-Buissons, Lion-sur-Mer, Hermanville-sur-Mer, which joined the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération in 2004. The population of the &quot;communauté d&#x27;agglomération&quot; is around 220,000 inhabitants.

In the former administrative organisation, Caen was a part of 9 cantons, of which it was the chief town. These cantons contained a total of 13 towns. Caen gave its name to a 10th canton, of which it was not part. Since the 2015 canton reorganization, Caen is part of the cantons of Caen-1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

==Transport==

<doc id="92447" wikidata="Q413283" url="?curid=92447" title="Superoxide">
<text>In chemistry, a superoxide is a compound that contains the superoxide ion, which has the chemical formula . The systematic name of the anion is dioxide(1−). The reactive oxygen ion superoxide is particularly important as the product of the one-electron reduction of dioxygen , which occurs widely in nature. Molecular oxygen (dioxygen) is a diradical containing two unpaired electrons, and superoxide results from the addition of an electron which fills one of the two degenerate molecular orbitals, leaving a charged ionic species with a single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of −1. Both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism. Superoxide was historically also known as &quot;hyperoxide&quot;.

==Salts==

Superoxide forms salts with alkali metals and alkaline earth metals. The salts sodium superoxide (), potassium superoxide (), rubidium superoxide () and caesium superoxide () are prepared by the reaction of with the respective alkali metal.

The alkali salts of are orange-yellow in color and quite stable, if they are kept dry. Upon dissolution of these salts in water, however, the dissolved undergoes disproportionation (dismutation) extremely rapidly (in a pH-dependent manner):

This reaction (with moisture and carbon dioxide in exhaled air) is the basis of the use of potassium superoxide as an oxygen source in chemical oxygen generators, such as those used on the Space Shuttle and on submarines. Superoxides are also used in firefighters&#x27; oxygen tanks to provide a readily available source of oxygen. In this process, acts as a Brønsted base, initially forming the hydroperoxyl radical ().

The superoxide anion, , and its protonated form, hydroperoxyl, are in equilibrium in an aqueous solution:

Given that the hydroperoxyl radical has a p&quot;K&quot;a of around 4.8, superoxide predominantly exists in the anionic form at neutral pH.

Potassium superoxide is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (facilitated by crown ethers) and is stable as long as protons are not available. Superoxide can also be generated in aprotic solvents by cyclic voltammetry.

Superoxide salts also decompose in the solid state, but this process requires heating:

==Biology==
Superoxide is common in biology, reflecting the pervasiveness of O2 and its ease of reduction. Superoxide is implicated in a number of biological processes, some with negative connotations, and some with beneficial effects.

Like hydroperoxyl, superoxide is classified as reactive oxygen species. It is generated by the immune system to kill invading microorganisms. In phagocytes, superoxide is produced in large quantities by the enzyme NADPH oxidase for use in oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms of invading pathogens. Mutations in the gene coding for the NADPH oxidase cause an immunodeficiency syndrome called chronic granulomatous disease, characterized by extreme susceptibility to infection, especially catalase-positive organisms. In turn, micro-organisms genetically engineered to lack the superoxide-scavenging enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) lose virulence. Superoxide is also deleterious when produced as a byproduct of mitochondrial respiration (most notably by Complex I and Complex III), as well as several other enzymes, for example xanthine oxidase, which can catalyze the transfer of electrons directly to molecular oxygen under strongly reducing conditions.

Because superoxide is toxic at high concentrations, nearly all aerobic organisms express SOD. SOD efficiently catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide:
Other proteins that can be both oxidized and reduced by superoxide (such as hemoglobin) have weak SOD-like activity. Genetic inactivation (&quot;knockout&quot;) of SOD produces deleterious phenotypes in organisms ranging from bacteria to mice and have provided important clues as to the mechanisms of toxicity of superoxide in vivo.

Yeast lacking both mitochondrial and cytosolic SOD grow very poorly in air, but quite well under anaerobic conditions. Absence of cytosolic SOD causes a dramatic increase in mutagenesis and genomic instability. Mice lacking mitochondrial SOD (MnSOD) die around 21 days after birth due to neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, and lactic acidosis. Mice lacking cytosolic SOD (CuZnSOD) are viable but suffer from multiple pathologies, including reduced lifespan, liver cancer, muscle atrophy, cataracts, thymic involution, haemolytic anemia, and a very rapid age-dependent decline in female fertility.

Superoxide may contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases (the evidence is particularly strong for radiation poisoning and hyperoxic injury), and perhaps also to aging via the oxidative damage that it inflicts on cells. While the action of superoxide in the pathogenesis of some conditions is strong (for instance, mice and rats overexpressing CuZnSOD or MnSOD are more resistant to strokes and heart attacks), the role of superoxide in aging must be regarded as unproven, for now. In model organisms (yeast, the fruit fly Drosophila, and mice), genetically knocking out CuZnSOD shortens lifespan and accelerates certain features of aging: (cataracts, muscle atrophy, macular degeneration, and thymic involution). But the converse, increasing the levels of CuZnSOD, does not seem to consistently increase lifespan (except perhaps in &quot;Drosophila&quot;). The most widely accepted view is that oxidative damage (resulting from multiple causes, including superoxide) is but one of several factors limiting lifespan.

The binding of by reduced () heme proteins involves formation of Fe(III) superoxide complex.

===Assay in biological systems===
The assay of superoxide in biological systems is complicated by its short half-life. One approach that has been used in quantitative assays converts superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, which is relatively stable. Hydrogen peroxide is then assayed by a fluorimetric method. As a free radical, superoxide has a strong EPR signal, and it is possible to detect superoxide directly using this method. For practical purposes, this can be achieved only in vitro under non-physiological conditions, such as high pH (which slows the spontaneous dismutation) with the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Researchers have developed a series of tool compounds termed &quot;spin traps&quot; that can react with superoxide, forming a meta-stable radical (half-life 1–15 minutes), which can be more readily detected by EPR. Superoxide spin-trapping was initially carried out with DMPO, but phosphorus derivatives with improved half-lives, such as DEPPMPO and DIPPMPO, have become more widely used.

==Bonding and structure==
Superoxides are compounds in which the oxidation number of oxygen is −. Whereas molecular oxygen (dioxygen) is a diradical containing two unpaired electrons, the addition of a second electron fills one of its two degenerate molecular orbitals, leaving a charged ionic species with single unpaired electron and a net negative charge of −1. Both dioxygen and the superoxide anion are free radicals that exhibit paramagnetism.

The derivatives of dioxygen have characteristic O–O distances that correlate with the order of the O–O bond.

<text>Schleswig-Flensburg (; ) is a district in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. It is bounded by (from the south and clockwise) the districts of Rendsburg-Eckernförde, Dithmarschen and Nordfriesland, the Region Syddanmark in Denmark, the city of Flensburg and the Baltic Sea.

==History==

Written history in the area began about 800 AD, when the Danish Viking settlement of Haithabu was founded. Later the neighbouring city of Schleswig took the place of Haithabu and became a powerful town in the 11th century. It later lost its power to Lübeck.

The district was established in 1974 by merging the former districts of Flensburg-Land and Schleswig. Due to the proximity of Denmark and the regional history there is a large percentage of Danish inhabitants.

==Geography==

The countryside is generally plain. The Schlei, a firth of the Baltic Sea, is the southern border of this district. All the land north of the Schlei and south of Flensburg is called the peninsula of Angeln. Angeln was the ancient home of the Germanic people known as the Angles, who migrated to England in the early Middle Ages.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays two lions, symbolizing the old duchy of Schleswig. At the bottom of the arms there is a wavy line symbolizing the Baltic Sea and its firths.

<text>Arthel Lane &quot;Doc&quot; Watson (March 3, 1923 – May 29, 2012) was an American guitarist, songwriter, and singer of bluegrass, folk, country, blues, and gospel music. He won seven Grammy awards as well as a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. His fingerpicking and flatpicking skills, as well as his knowledge of traditional American music, were highly regarded. Blind from a young age, he performed publicly both in a dance band and solo, as well as for over 15 years with his son, guitarist Merle Watson, until Merle&#x27;s death in 1985 in an accident on the family farm.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Watson was born in Deep Gap, North Carolina. According to Watson on his three-CD biographical recording &quot;Legacy&quot;, he got the nickname &quot;Doc&quot; during a live radio broadcast when the announcer remarked that his given name Arthel was odd and he needed an easy nickname. A fan in the crowd shouted &quot;Call him Doc!&quot;, presumably in reference to the literary character Sherlock Holmes&#x27;s companion, Doctor Watson. The name stuck.

An eye infection caused Watson to lose his vision before his second birthday. He attended North Carolina&#x27;s school for the blind, the Governor Morehead School, in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In a 1989 radio interview with Terry Gross on the &quot;Fresh Air&quot; show on National Public Radio, Watson spoke about how he got his first guitar. His father told him if he and his brother David chopped down all the small dead chestnut trees along the edge of their field, they could sell the wood to a tannery. Watson bought a Sears Silvertone from Sears Roebuck with his earnings, while his brother bought a new suit. Later in the same interview, Watson mentioned that his first high-quality guitar was a Martin D-18.

Watson&#x27;s earliest influences were country roots musicians and groups such as the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers. The first song he learned to play on the guitar was &quot;When Roses Bloom in Dixieland&quot;, first recorded by the Carter Family in 1930. Watson said in an interview with &quot;American Songwriter&quot; that &quot;Jimmie Rodgers was the first man that I started to claim as my favorite.&quot; Watson proved to be a natural musical talent and within months was performing on local street corners playing songs from the Delmore Brothers, Louvin Brothers, and Monroe Brothers alongside his brother Linny. By the time Watson reached adulthood, he had become a proficient acoustic and electric guitar player.

===Career===
In 1953, Watson joined the Johnson City, Tennessee–based Jack Williams&#x27;s country and western swing band on electric guitar. The band seldom had a fiddle player, but was often asked to play at square dances. Following the example of country guitarists Grady Martin and Hank Garland, Watson taught himself to play fiddle tunes on his Gibson Les Paul electric guitar. He later transferred the technique to acoustic guitar, and playing fiddle tunes became part of his signature sound. During his time with Jack Williams, Watson also supported his family as a piano tuner.

In 1960, as the American folk music revival grew, Watson took the advice of folk musicologist and Smithsonian curator Ralph Rinzler and began playing acoustic guitar and banjo exclusively. That move ignited Watson&#x27;s career when he played on his first recording, &quot;Old Time Music at Clarence Ashley&#x27;s&quot;. Also of pivotal importance for his career was his February 11, 1961, appearance at P.S. 41 in Greenwich Village. He then began to tour as a solo performer and appeared at universities and clubs like the Ash Grove in Los Angeles. Watson eventually got his big break and rave reviews for his performance at the Newport Folk Festival in Newport, Rhode Island in 1963. Watson recorded his first solo album in 1964 and began performing with his son Merle in the same year.

After the folk revival waned during the late 1960s, Doc Watson&#x27;s career was sustained by his performance of the Jimmy Driftwood song &quot;Tennessee Stud&quot; on the 1972 live album recording &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken&quot;. As popular as ever, Doc and Merle began playing as a trio with T. Michael Coleman on bass guitar in 1974. The trio toured the globe during the late seventies and early eighties, recording eleven albums between 1973 and 1985, and bringing Doc and Merle&#x27;s unique blend of acoustic music to millions of new fans. In 1985, Merle died in a tractor accident on his family farm. Two years later Merle Fest was inaugurated in remembrance of him.

Doc Watson played guitar in both flatpicking and fingerpicking style, but is best known for his flatpick work. His guitar playing skills, combined with his authenticity as a mountain musician, made him a highly influential figure during the folk music revival. He pioneered a fast and flashy bluegrass lead guitar style including fiddle tunes and crosspicking techniques which were adopted and extended by Clarence White, Tony Rice and many others. Watson was also an accomplished banjo player and sometimes accompanied himself on harmonica as well. Known also for his distinctive and rich baritone voice, Watson over the years developed a vast repertoire of mountain ballads, which he learned via the oral tradition of his home area in Deep Gap, North Carolina.

Watson played a Martin model D-18 guitar on his earliest recordings. In 1968, Watson began a relationship with Gallagher Guitars when he started playing their G-50 model. His first Gallagher, which Watson referred to as &quot;Ol&#x27; Hoss&quot;, was on display at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville before residing at the Gallagher shop until 2012, when it was auctioned through Christie&#x27;s on November 27, 2012. In 1974, Gallagher created a customized G-50 line to meet Watson&#x27;s preferred specifications, which bears the Doc Watson name. In 1991, Gallagher customized a personal cutaway guitar for Watson that he played until his death and which he referred to as &quot;Donald&quot; in honor of Gallagher guitar&#x27;s second-generation proprietor and builder, Don Gallagher. During his last years, Watson played a Dana Bourgeois dreadnought given to him by Ricky Skaggs for his 80th birthday. Another of Watson&#x27;s favorites was his Arnold guitar, &quot;The Jimmie&quot;, built by luthier John Arnold as a tribute to the famous 1926 Martin 00-18 played by Jimmie Rodgers.

In 1994, Watson teamed with musicians Randy Scruggs and Earl Scruggs to contribute the classic song &quot;Keep on the Sunny Side&quot; to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Country produced by the Red Hot Organization.

===Later life===
In his later life, Watson scaled back his touring schedule. He was generally joined onstage by his grandson (Merle&#x27;s son) Richard, as well as longtime musical partners David Holt or Jack Lawrence. On June 19, 2007, Watson was accompanied by Australian guitar player Tommy Emmanuel at a concert at the Bass Performance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas. Watson also performed, accompanied by Holt and Richard, at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival in San Francisco in 2009, as he had done for several previous festivals.

Watson hosted the annual MerleFest music festival held every April at Wilkes Community College in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. The festival features a vast array of acoustic style music focusing on the folk, bluegrass, blues and old-time music genres. It was named in honor of Merle Watson and is one of the most popular acoustic music festivals in the world, drawing over 70,000 music fans each year. The festival has continued after his death.

Watson was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2010.

==Personal life==
In 1947, Watson married Rosa Lee Carlton, the daughter of popular fiddle player Gaither Carlton. The couple had two children, Eddy Merle (named after country music legends Eddy Arnold and Merle Travis) in 1949 and Nancy Ellen in 1951.
On April 29, 2012, Watson performed with the Nashville Bluegrass Band on the Creekside Stage at MerleFest. It was an annual tradition for Watson to join the Nashville Bluegrass Band for a gospel set on the festival&#x27;s Sunday morning. It would be his final performance.

On May 21, 2012, Watson fell at his home. He was not seriously injured in the fall, but an underlying medical condition prompted surgery on his colon. Watson died on May 29, 2012, at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center of complications following the surgery at the age of 89. He is buried in the Merle and Doc Watson Memorial Cemetery, Deep Gap with his wife and son.

==Legacy==
In 2002, High Windy Audio released a multi-CD biographical album of Watson&#x27;s work, titled &quot;Legacy&quot;. The collection features audio interviews with Watson interspersed with music, as well as a complete recording of a live performance at the Diana Wortham Theatre in Asheville, North Carolina. The collection won the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Folk Album.

In 2010, Blooming Twig Books published a comprehensive biography of Watson, written by Kent Gustavson. The book, titled &quot;Blind But Now I See: The Biography of Music Legend Doc Watson&quot;, features never before published content regarding Watson&#x27;s life and career, gleaned from interviews with Watson&#x27;s friends and collaborators including Norman Blake, Sam Bush, members of the Seeger family, Michelle Shocked, and many others. The book also covers the life, supporting role, and untimely death of Merle Watson. An updated edition was released by Sumach-Red Books in March 2012.

In April 2013, Open Records released a multi-disc collection of unreleased recordings by Watson. The collection, titled &quot;Milestones&quot;, features 94 songs as well as stories, remembrances, and over 500 photographs. The collection was created by Watson&#x27;s daughter, Nancy, and is being produced by ETSU Bluegrass and ETSU professor Roy Andrade.

The popularity of the flat picking style of guitar playing has been partially credited to Doc Watson and bluegrass bands have incorporated it widely including artist such as Billy Strings.

==Awards and honors==
In 1986, Watson received the North Carolina Award and in 1994 he received a North Carolina Folk Heritage Award. He is a recipient of a 1988 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. In 2000, Watson was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor in Owensboro, Kentucky. In 1997, Watson received the National Medal of Arts from U.S. President Bill Clinton. In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctor of music degree from Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts.

There is a sign on U.S. Route 421 near Deep Gap (Watson&#x27;s birthplace) with the inscription, &quot;Doc and Merle Watson Highway&quot;, where that part of the highway is named for both Doc Watson and his son.

<doc id="92453" wikidata="Q794972" url="?curid=92453" title="B*Witched">
<text>B*Witched are an Irish girl group consisting of twin sisters Edele and Keavy Lynch, Lindsay Armaou and Sinéad O&#x27;Carroll. Originally active between 1997 and 2002, they enjoyed success in both Europe and North America between 1998 and 2002, releasing two albums and eight singles, all of which made the UK Top 20. Their first four singles, &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot;, &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, &quot;To You I Belong&quot; and &quot;Blame It on the Weatherman&quot;, all reached number one in the UK Singles Chart and the group has sold over 3 million albums worldwide.

On 18 October 2012, it was announced that B*Witched would reunite for the ITV2 reality-documentary series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; in 2013, along with other pop groups of their time. Due to the success, they officially returned. In May 2013, B*Witched unveiled a new song called &quot;Love and Money&quot; which served as the group&#x27;s lead single from their 2014 EP, &quot;Champagne or Guinness&quot;. In 2023, B*Witched released the single &quot;Birthday&quot; to celebrate their 25th anniversary.

== Career ==
=== 1996–1998: Formation and &quot;B*Witched&quot; ===

All four members of B*Witched knew each other vaguely from dancing at Digges Lane dance studios in Dublin. Sinéad O&#x27;Carroll met Keavy Lynch in a garage in the Dublin suburb of Finglas, where Keavy was working as a part-time mechanic. The two of them became friends after talking about music and the idea of being in a band. Lindsay Armaou met Keavy at a kickboxing class. In 1996, Keavy, Sinéad, and Keavy&#x27;s twin sister Edele decided to put a group together, originally called Butterfly Farm. They later became a four-piece when Armaou joined.

The group initially used the name Sister, before settling on B*Witched. The band members deliberately cultivated a tomboy image and, in order to appeal to a younger audience, understated their ages in their early years. Edele and Keavy&#x27;s older brother Shane Lynch (of the band Boyzone) helped the group find a manager, Kim Glover, who signed the group to Glowworm Records, the Epic Records label she ran, in 1997. The label&#x27;s co-head, Ray &quot;Madman&quot; Hedges, produced all of B*Witched&#x27;s releases. The group&#x27;s first ever gig was in Thompsons Garage in Belfast, during which their microphones did not work.

B*Witched released their debut single &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie&quot; on 25 May 1998, prior to their first show at Lawmuir Primary School in Bellshill as part of Jobee&#x27;s 20-year anniversary. Despite mixed reviews, it reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, making B*Witched became the youngest girl group to have a number one in the UK (a feat that has since been surpassed by the Sugababes and Little Mix). Following its release in the United States, the song went to number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Subsequent singles &quot;Rollercoaster&quot;, &quot;To You I Belong&quot; and &quot;Blame It on the Weatherman&quot; also topped the UK chart. They also performed the theme song for the Saturday morning cartoon &quot;&quot;. Their self-titled debut album, released in October 1998, reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified 2× Platinum in the UK. The album also peaked at number 12 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified Platinum in the US.

=== 1999–2002: &quot;Awake and Breathe&quot;, O&#x27;Carroll&#x27;s departure and break up ===
In 1999, B*Witched appeared on the ABBA tribute single &quot;Thank ABBA for the Music&quot;, which reached number four in the UK, and recorded a cover of &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot; for the subsequent &quot;ABBAmania&quot; album and TV special. Singing dolls of the group were made by Yaboom Toys in 1999. Along with Britney Spears, they performed the opening act for NSYNC&#x27;s world tour NSYNC in Concert. B*Witched&#x27;s second album, &quot;Awake and Breathe&quot;, released a year after their debut, peaked at number 5 on the charts and was certified Platinum. Singles from the album were less successful than earlier releases (&quot;Jesse Hold On&quot; reached number 4, &quot;I Shall Be There&quot; number 13 and &quot;Jump Down&quot; number 16 in the UK). After touring Europe and America, where they co-headlined the &quot;All That&quot; Music and More Festival with LFO and Blaque, the band began work on a third album. Three new songs were recorded: &quot;Hold On&quot; (featured in &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;); a cover of Toni Basil&#x27;s &quot;Mickey&quot; (featured in &quot;Bring It On&quot;); and a cover of Wild Cherry&#x27;s &quot;Play That Funky Music&quot;. The latter two appeared on their new American EP, &quot;Across America 2000&quot;, along with live tracks and the earlier cover of &quot;Does Your Mother Know&quot;.

In 2001, a third album was in the works, and the band had chosen &quot;Where Will You Go?&quot; as the new single. On 4 July 2001, B*Witched made a guest appearance on the United States daytime television medical drama, &quot;General Hospital&quot;. In October, before the group could film a music video for &quot;Where Will You Go?”, the girls received a phone call from their manager telling them their record label Sony had dropped them. In June 2002, after one year without signing a new record deal, O&#x27;Carroll left the band, unhappy with the forced hiatus. In September 2002 the group split.

=== 2012–present: Return, &quot;Champagne or Guinness&quot; and Touring===
On 18 October 2012, it was announced that B*Witched would reunite for the ITV2 series &quot;The Big Reunion&quot; along with five other pop groups of their time—Honeyz, 911, Liberty X, Five and Atomic Kitten (Blue later joined as well). The show featured each group telling their stories of their times in their respective bands, before rehearsing together ahead of one major comeback performance at the Hammersmith Apollo. B*Witched had to hold &quot;emotional clear the air&quot; talks before reforming. Edele admitted that she and Sinéad had fallen out in 2006 and had not spoken to each other since: &quot;My biggest anxiety about doing this – there&#x27;s only one, and it&#x27;s Sinéad, I think. It&#x27;s just how I&#x27;m going to feel about being in her person again.&quot; Lindsay also said: &quot;Some of the issues we didn&#x27;t even know were necessarily there until we were faced with this opportunity that we have to work together again, then we were like, &#x27;Oh, OK, in order for us to do this then we have to sort a few things out.&#x27; It all just came up. It&#x27;s been difficult to get to this point. There&#x27;s been a lot of talking, a lot of talking. But we&#x27;re here now. It&#x27;s very surreal being called B*Witched again because it&#x27;s been 12 years.&quot;

Due to the success of &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, the bands embarked on an arena tour around the UK and Ireland in May 2013. The groups got together to record a charity single, a cover of Wizzard&#x27;s &quot;I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday&quot;, for &quot;Text Santa&quot;. In March, Armaou announced that they would record new material. On 4 May, the group released a promotional single called &quot;Love and Money&quot; on YouTube. On 3 October, Edele Lynch announced in an interview to Today FM that they were recording their third album. On 11 December, B*Witched made an announcement via PledgeMusic. The EP, titled &quot;Champagne or Guinness&quot;, was released on 28 September 2014. On 12 February 2016, B*Witched released the compilation album &quot;C&#x27;est la Vie – The Collection&quot;, a 36-track double album featuring tracks from their first two albums and two tracks from their 2014 &quot;Champagne or Guinness&quot; EP. B*Witched had planned to tour Australia in 2017, along with other acts including Atomic Kitten and Liberty X.

In October 2019, the band returned with a brand new single, &quot;Hold On&quot;, a cover of the U.S. number-one hit of the same name by Wilson Phillips.

In March 2021, B*Witched started hosting a new podcast called &quot;Starting Over with B*Witched&quot;.

In March 2023, the group released the single &quot;Birthday&quot; to celebrate their 25th anniversary, stating: &quot;We will get to the point of an album. Right now we’re releasing singles, but the singles will keep coming and eventually they’ll be on the album [...] there’s definitely more in the pipeline&quot;.

In August 2024 the group released an EP, &quot;Ripped Jeans,&quot; containing three new tracks: &quot;So into You&quot;, &quot;Multiply&quot;, &quot;My Greatest Little Mistake&quot;, and &quot;Birthday&quot;.

<text>Antiochus IV Epiphanes ( 215 BC–November/December 164 BC) was king of the Seleucid Empire from 175 BC until his death in 164 BC. Notable events during Antiochus&#x27; reign include his near-conquest of Ptolemaic Egypt, his persecution of the Jews of Judea and Samaria, and the rebellion of the Jewish Maccabees.

The son of King Antiochus III the Great, Antiochus IV accession to the throne was controversial, as he was seen as a usurper by some. After the death of his brother Seleucus IV Philopator in 175 BC, the &quot;true&quot; heir should have been Seleucus&#x27;s son Demetrius I. However, Demetrius I was very young and a hostage in Rome at the time, and Antiochus seized the opportunity to declare himself king instead, successfully rallying enough of the Greek ruling class in Antioch to support his claim. This helped set a destabilizing trend in the Seleucid Empire in subsequent generations, as an increasing number of claimants tried to usurp the throne. After his own death, power struggles between competing lines of the ruling dynasty heavily contributed to the collapse of the empire. Antiochus&#x27;s often eccentric behavior and capricious actions led some of his contemporaries to call him &quot;Epimanes&quot; (&quot;The Mad&quot;).

==Biography==
===Rise to power===
Born around 215 BC, Antiochus was a son of the Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great. Antiochus appears to have been originally named Mithridates, although this name would be changed either after the death of his elder brother Antiochus or when he eventually ascended the throne. As a potential successor to the throne, he became a political hostage of the Roman Republic under the terms of the Treaty of Apamea, concluded in 188 BC. After his older brother Seleucus IV Philopator succeeded their father onto the throne in 187 BC, Antiochus was exchanged for his nephew Demetrius, the son and heir of Seleucus. After this Antiochus lived in Athens and was there when his brother was assassinated in 175 BC by the government minister Heliodorus.

Heliodorus proclaimed himself regent afterward, essentially giving himself control of the government. This arrangement did not last long. With the help of king Eumenes II of Pergamum, Antiochus IV traveled from Athens through Asia Minor and reached Syria by November 175 BC. Seleucus&#x27; legitimate heir Demetrius was still a hostage in Rome, so Antiochus seized the throne for himself, proclaiming himself co-regent with another son of Seleucus, an infant named Antiochus. (Antiochus, son of Seleucus IV would later die in 170 BC, possibly murdered by Antiochus IV).

===Ruling style===
Antiochus IV cultivated a reputation as an extravagant and generous ruler. He scattered money to common people in the streets of Antioch; gave unexpected gifts to people he did not know; contributed money to the Temple of Zeus at Athens and the altar at Delos; put all his Western military forces on a massive parade at Daphne, a suburb of Antioch; and held opulent banquets with the aristocracy using the best spices, clothing, and food. He also supplemented the Seleucid army with mercenaries. All of this cost the Seleucid treasury, but the Empire was apparently able to raise enough taxes to pay for it. His eccentric behavior and unexpected interactions with common people such as appearing in the public bath houses and applying for municipal offices led his detractors to call him &quot;Epimanes&quot; (Ἐπιμανής, &quot;Epimanḗs&quot;, &quot;The Mad&quot;), a word play on his title &quot;Epiphanes&quot; (&quot;God Manifest&quot;).

===Wars against Egypt and relations with Rome===

After his ascension Antiochus took care to maintain good relations with the Roman Republic, sending an embassy to Rome in 173 BC with a part of the unpaid indemnity still owed from the 188 BC Treaty of Apamea. While there the embassy secured a renewed treaty of friendship and alliance with Rome, greatly helped by the fact Antiochus had come to power with the help of Eumenes II, Rome&#x27;s principal ally in the region.

The guardians of King Ptolemy VI Philometor demanded the return of Coele-Syria in 170 BC, declaring war on the Seleucids on the assumption that the kingdom was divided after Antiochus&#x27; murder of his nephew. However, Antiochus had warning of the attack and had prepared more thoroughly. He had already built his forces and moved them into position; as soon as the Egyptian forces left Pelusium they were attacked and defeated by Antiochus IV and his Seleucid army. The Seleucids then seized Pelusium, giving them supplies and access to all of Egypt. He advanced into Egypt proper, conquering all but Alexandria and capturing King Ptolemy. This was partially achieved because Rome (Ptolemaic Egypt&#x27;s traditional ally) was embroiled in the Third Macedonian War and was not willing to become involved elsewhere.

To avoid alarming Rome, Antiochus allowed Ptolemy VI to continue ruling as a puppet king from Memphis. Upon Antiochus&#x27; withdrawal, the city of Alexandria chose a new king, one of Ptolemy&#x27;s brothers, also named Ptolemy (VIII Euergetes). The Ptolemy brothers reconciled and agreed to rule Egypt jointly instead of fighting a civil war.

In 168 BC, Antiochus led a second attack on Egypt and also sent a fleet to capture Cyprus. Before he reached Alexandria, his path was blocked by a single elderly Roman ambassador named Gaius Popillius Laenas who delivered a message from the Roman Senate directing Antiochus to withdraw his armies from Egypt and Cyprus or consider himself in a state of war with the Roman Republic. Antiochus said he would discuss it with his council, whereupon the Roman envoy drew a line in the sand around Antiochus and said: &quot;Before you leave this circle, give me a reply that I can take back to the Roman Senate.&quot; This implied Rome would declare war if the King stepped out of the circle without committing to leave Egypt immediately. Weighing his options, Antiochus decided to withdraw. Only then did Popillius agree to shake hands with him. Ancient sources and traditional historiography describe this &quot;Day of Eleusis&quot; as a great humiliation for Antiochus IV that unhinged him for a time. Some more modern historians conjecture that Antiochus may have been more reconciled to this than ancient sources indicate, as the Roman intervention meant that Antiochus had been given an excuse to not undertake a potentially long and costly siege of Alexandria. He could instead return with treasure and loot having weakened the Egyptian state at little risk and cost compared to a larger-scale invasion.

===Persecution of the Jews and the Maccabean revolt===

The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea: they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.

Local revolts against the Seleucid Empire were not unusual, but most were not successful. The revolt that Antiochus IV ultimately triggered in Judea was unusually well chronicled and preserved, however. According to the book of 2 Maccabees, the crisis had its origins in the years leading up to the Sixth Syrian War. In 171 BC, Antiochus had deposed the High Priest Jason and replaced him with Menelaus, who had offered Antiochus a large bribe to secure the office. In 168 BC, when Antiochus was campaigning in Egypt, a rumor spread in Judea that he had been killed. Jason gathered a force of 1,000 soldiers and made a surprise attack on the city of Jerusalem. Menelaus was forced to flee Jerusalem during the ensuing riot. Jason&#x27;s intention may have been to retake his former office by force and present his reassumption of power as &quot;fait accompli&quot; to the regency that would take power in the wake of the king&#x27;s death, assuming that they would allow him to stay in power rather than invite further conflict during a delicate political moment. But Antiochus was still alive, and returned from Egypt enraged by the reverse he had suffered at the hands of the Romans and by the Jews&#x27; rejection of his chosen candidate for High Priest; he attacked Jerusalem and restored Menelaus, then executed many Jews.

According to 1 Maccabees, after restoring Menelaus, Antiochus IV issued decrees aimed at helping the most enthusiastically pro-Greek faction of Hellenized Jews against the traditionalists. He outlawed Jewish religious rites and traditions and the Temple in Jerusalem was forcibly changed to a syncretic Greek-Jewish cult that included worship of Zeus. The Greek historian Diodorus wrote that Antiochus &quot;sacrificed a great swine at the image of Moses, and at the altar of God that stood in the outward court, and sprinkled them with the blood of the sacrifice. He commanded likewise that the books, by which they were taught to hate all other nations, should be sprinkled with the broth made of the swine&#x27;s flesh. And he put out the lamp (called by them immortal) which burns continually in the temple. Lastly he forced the high priest and the other Jews to eat swine&#x27;s flesh.&quot;

These decrees were a departure from typical Seleucid practice, which did not attempt to suppress local religions in their empire, though they may be similar to other instances in the Hellenistic era when local polities were punished for revolt against their imperial suzerain by having their autonomy and local laws repealed and local shrines removed from their control. The city of Jerusalem was sacked a second time in the disorder. Antiochus established a military Greek citadel called the Acra in Jerusalem to serve as a stronghold for Hellenized Jews and a Greek military garrison. This happened from 168–167 BC.

Such steps triggered a revolt against his rule, known as the Maccabean Revolt. Scholars of Second Temple Judaism therefore sometimes refer to Antiochus&#x27; reign as the &#x27;Antiochene crises&#x27; for the Jews. Traditionally, as expressed in the First and Second Books of the Maccabees, the Maccabean Revolt was painted as a national resistance to a foreign political and cultural oppression. In modern times, however, scholars have argued that Antiochus IV was more intervening in a civil war between the traditionalist Jews in the country and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.

Scholars think the revolt also led to the writing of the Book of Daniel, where a villain called the &quot;King of the North&quot; is generally considered to be a reference to Antiochus IV. The portrayal of Antiochus there attacking the holy city of Jerusalem but eventually meeting his end would influence later Christian depictions of the Antichrist.

===Final years===
King Mithridates I of Parthia took advantage of Antiochus&#x27; western problems and attacked from the east, seizing the city of Herat in 167 BC and disrupting the direct trade route to India, effectively splitting the Greek world in two. Antiochus recognized the potential danger in the east but was unwilling to give up control of Judea. He sent a commander named Lysias to deal with the Maccabees, while Antiochus himself led the main Seleucid army against the Parthians. Antiochus had initial success in his eastern campaign, capturing king Artaxias and reconquering the Kingdom of Armenia. His campaign went through Ecbatana and he and his forces attacked Persepolis but were driven off by the populace. On his return home, he died at Isfahan in 164 BC.

Various religious explanations exist for Antiochus IV&#x27;s death. Apparently, he attacked a temple of the Mesopotamian deity Nanaya in Persia shortly before his demise, and his death was possibly attributed to impiety and punishment by Nanaya in some quarters. Jewish sources gave credit for Antiochus&#x27;s death to his earlier impiety at the Temple of Jerusalem. According to 2 Maccabees, he died from divinely-inflicted disease:

According to the later rabbinical work, the scroll of Antiochus (Megillat Antiochus), when Antiochus heard that his army had been defeated in Judea, he boarded a ship and fled to the coastal cities. Wherever he came the people rebelled and called him &quot;The Fugitive,&quot; so he drowned himself in the sea. This story is from the 2nd century, however, much further removed from the event than Polybius or 2 Maccabees. It is generally considered secondary and unlikely to be accurate.

==Legacy==
===Jewish tradition===

Antiochus IV is remembered as a major villain and persecutor in the Jewish traditions associated with Hanukkah, including the Books of the Maccabees and the &quot;Scroll of Antiochus&quot;. Rabbinical sources refer to him as הרשע &quot;harasha&quot; (&quot;the wicked&quot;). &quot;The Jewish Encyclopedia&quot; concluded that &quot;[s]ince Jewish and heathen sources agree in their characterization of him, their portrayal is evidently correct&quot;, summarizing this portrayal as one of a cruel and vainglorious ruler who tried to force on all the peoples of his realm a Hellenic culture, &quot;the true essence of which he can scarcely be said to have appreciated&quot;. Josephus writing in Antiquities of the Jews describes Antiochus IV desecrating the Second Jewish Temple and renaming it &quot;The Temple of Jupiter Hellenius.&quot; Antiochus IV is also described by Josephus as executing anyone performing Jewish practices or in possession of Jewish texts in addition to circumcised males.

=== Divine epithets ===
Antiochus was the first Seleucid king to use divine epithets on coins, perhaps inspired by the Bactrian Hellenistic kings who had earlier done so, or else building on the ruler cult that his father Antiochus the Great had codified within the Seleucid Empire. These epithets included &quot;manifest god&quot;, and, after his defeat of Egypt, &quot;bringer of victory&quot;.

===Historiography===
The most important ancient non-Jewish source on Antiochus IV is the Greek historian Polybius, generally considered one of the highest-quality sources on the time period. Polybius paints a negative picture of him, and other surviving accounts have as well. The negative accounts of the Jews in the Books of the Maccabees are also influential. On the basis of this, Antiochus IV has generally been judged poorly.

There are historians who think that these hostile depictions deserve some skepticism, however. Not all ancient accounts are hostile; the historian Appian does not say anything particularly bad about Antiochus IV, in contrast. Polybius does not appear to be neutral on this issue, as he was good friends with Antiochus IV&#x27;s nephew and rival Demetrius I; the two both spent years in exile in Rome. The Achaean League which Polybius hailed from was also traditionally hostile to the Seleucid Empire. Polybius was, like many of the educated upper class, something of an elitist. So stories related by Polybius such as those of Antiochus IV frolicking with commoners at taverns may have soured his reputation in antiquity, even though modern values would find this kind of behavior unobjectionable. The historian Dov Gera writes in defense of Antiochus IV that he was a &quot;talented and accomplished politician&quot; and that &quot;the negative portrait of him painted by Polybius was influenced by political considerations of his friends... and should not be trusted.&quot; There is also some evidence on this: historian Nick Sekunda notes that Alexander Balas successfully challenged King Demetrius for leadership of the Seleucid Empire decades later in 152 BC while claiming to be an unknown son of Antiochus IV. This claim appears to have been useful to him, suggesting Antiochus IV was remembered fondly by at least some. Even 1 Maccabees, an extremely hostile source, has Antiochus IV wonder on his deathbed why calamity has struck him when he was &quot;well-loved in the day of my power&quot;.

<doc id="92465" wikidata="Q429331" url="?curid=92465" title="Lambert W function">
<text>In mathematics, the Lambert function, also called the omega function or product logarithm, is a multivalued function, namely the branches of the converse relation of the function , where is any complex number and is the exponential function. The function is named after Johann Lambert, who considered a related problem in 1758. Building on Lambert&#x27;s work, Leonhard Euler described the function per se in 1783.

For each integer there is one branch, denoted by , which is a complex-valued function of one complex argument. is known as the principal branch. These functions have the following property: if and are any complex numbers, then
: formula_1
holds if and only if
: formula_2

When dealing with real numbers only, the two branches and suffice: for real numbers and the equation
: formula_3
can be solved for only if ; yields if and the two values and if .

The Lambert function&#x27;s branches cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. It is useful in combinatorics, for instance, in the enumeration of trees. It can be used to solve various equations involving exponentials (e.g. the maxima of the Planck, Bose–Einstein, and Fermi–Dirac distributions) and also occurs in the solution of delay differential equations, such as . In biochemistry, and in particular enzyme kinetics, an opened-form solution for the time-course kinetics analysis of Michaelis–Menten kinetics is described in terms of the Lambert function.


== Terminology ==
The notation convention chosen here (with and ) follows the canonical reference on the Lambert function by Corless, Gonnet, Hare, Jeffrey and Knuth.

The name &quot;product logarithm&quot; can be understood as follows: since the inverse function of is termed the logarithm, it makes sense to call the inverse &quot;function&quot; of the product the &quot;product logarithm&quot;. (Technical note: like the complex logarithm, it is multivalued and thus W is described as a converse relation rather than inverse function.) It is related to the omega constant, which is equal to .

== History ==
Lambert first considered the related &quot;Lambert&#x27;s Transcendental Equation&quot; in 1758, which led to an article by Leonhard Euler in 1783 that discussed the special case of .

The equation Lambert considered was 
: formula_4

Euler transformed this equation into the form
: formula_5

Both authors derived a series solution for their equations.

Once Euler had solved this equation, he considered the case . Taking limits, he derived the equation
: formula_6

He then put and obtained a convergent series solution for the resulting equation, expressing in terms of .

After taking derivatives with respect to and some manipulation, the standard form of the Lambert function is obtained.

In 1993, it was reported that the Lambert function provides an exact solution to the quantum-mechanical double-well Dirac delta function model for equal charges—a fundamental problem in physics. Prompted by this, Rob Corless and developers of the Maple computer algebra system realized that &quot;the Lambert W function has been widely used in many fields, but because of differing notation and the absence of a standard name, awareness of the function was not as high as it should have been.&quot;

Another example where this function is found is in Michaelis–Menten kinetics.

Although it was widely believed that the Lambert function cannot be expressed in terms of elementary (Liouvillian) functions, the first published proof did not appear until 2008.

== Elementary properties, branches and range ==


There are countably many branches of the function, denoted by , for integer ; being the main (or principal) branch. is defined for all complex numbers &quot;z&quot; while with is defined for all non-zero &quot;z&quot;. With and for all .

The branch point for the principal branch is at , with a branch cut that extends to along the negative real axis. This branch cut separates the principal branch from the two branches and . In all branches with , there is a branch point at and a branch cut along the entire negative real axis.

The functions are all injective and their ranges are disjoint. The range of the entire multivalued function is the complex plane. The image of the real axis is the union of the real axis and the quadratrix of Hippias, the parametric curve .
=== Inverse ===
The range plot above also delineates the regions in the complex plane where the simple inverse relationship is true. implies that there exists an such that , where depends upon the value of . The value of the integer changes abruptly when is at the branch cut of , which means that , except for where it is .

Defining , where and are real, and expressing in polar coordinates, it is seen that
: formula_7

For formula_8, the branch cut for is the non-positive real axis, so that
: formula_9
and
: formula_10
For formula_11, the branch cut for is the real axis with formula_12, so that the inequality becomes
: formula_13

Inside the regions bounded by the above, there are no discontinuous changes in , and those regions specify where the function is simply invertible, i.e. .
== Calculus ==

=== Derivative ===
By implicit differentiation, one can show that all branches of satisfy the differential equation
: formula_14
( is not differentiable for .) As a consequence, that gets the following formula for the derivative of &quot;W&quot;:
: formula_15

Using the identity , gives the following equivalent formula:
: formula_16

At the origin we have
: formula_17

The n-th derivative of is of the form:
: formula_18

Where is a polynomial function with coefficients defined in . If and only if is a root of then is a root of the n-th derivative of .

Taking the derivative of the n-th derivative of yields:
: formula_19
Inductively proving the n-th derivative equation.

=== Integral ===
The function , and many other expressions involving , can be integrated using the substitution , i.e. :
: formula_20
(The last equation is more common in the literature but is undefined at ). One consequence of this (using the fact that ) is the identity
: formula_21

== Asymptotic expansions ==
The Taylor series of around 0 can be found using the Lagrange inversion theorem and is given by
: formula_22

The radius of convergence is , as may be seen by the ratio test. The function defined by this series can be extended to a holomorphic function defined on all complex numbers with a branch cut along the interval ; this holomorphic function defines the principal branch of the Lambert function.

For large values of , is asymptotic to
: formula_23
where , , and is a non-negative Stirling number of the first kind. Keeping only the first two terms of the expansion,
: formula_24

The other real branch, , defined in the interval , has an approximation of the same form as approaches zero, with in this case and .

=== Integer and complex powers ===
Integer powers of also admit simple Taylor (or Laurent) series expansions at zero:
: formula_25

More generally, for , the Lagrange inversion formula gives
: formula_26
which is, in general, a Laurent series of order . Equivalently, the latter can be written in the form of a Taylor expansion of powers of :
: formula_27
which holds for any and .

== Bounds and inequalities ==
A number of non-asymptotic bounds are known for the Lambert function.

Hoorfar and Hassani showed that the following bound holds for :
: formula_28

They also showed the general bound
: formula_29
for every formula_30 and formula_31, with equality only for formula_32.
The bound allows many other bounds to be made, such as taking formula_33 which gives the bound
: formula_34

In 2013 it was proven that the branch can be bounded as follows:
: formula_35
Roberto Iacono and John P. Boyd enhanced the bounds as follows: 
: formula_36

== Identities ==
A few identities follow from the definition:
: formula_37
Note that, since is not injective, it does not always hold that , much like with the inverse trigonometric functions. For fixed and , the equation has two real solutions in , one of which is of course . Then, for and , as well as for and , is the other solution.

Some other identities:
: formula_38
: formula_39
: formula_40
: formula_41
: formula_42
:: (which can be extended to other and if the correct branch is chosen).
: formula_43

Substituting in the definition:
: formula_44

With Euler&#x27;s iterated exponential :
: formula_45

== Special values ==
The following are special values of the principal branch:
formula_46
formula_47
formula_48
formula_49
formula_50
formula_51
: formula_52 (the omega constant)
formula_53
formula_54
formula_55
formula_56
formula_57
formula_58

Special values of the branch :
formula_59

== Representations ==
The principal branch of the Lambert function can be represented by a proper integral, due to Poisson:
: formula_60

Another representation of the principal branch was found by Kalugin–Jeffrey–Corless: 
: formula_61

The following continued fraction representation also holds for the principal branch:
: formula_62
Also, if :
: formula_63
In turn, if , then
: formula_64

== Other formulas ==

=== Definite integrals ===
There are several useful definite integral formulas involving the principal branch of the function, including the following:
: formula_65

The first identity can be found by writing the Gaussian integral in polar coordinates.

The second identity can be derived by making the substitution , which gives
: formula_66

Thus
: formula_67

The third identity may be derived from the second by making the substitution and the first can also be derived from the third by the substitution .

Except for along the branch cut (where the integral does not converge), the principal branch of the Lambert function can be computed by the following integral:
: formula_68
where the two integral expressions are equivalent due to the symmetry of the integrand.

=== Indefinite integrals ===

== Applications ==

=== Solving equations ===
The Lambert function is used to solve equations in which the unknown quantity occurs both in the base and in the exponent, or both inside and outside of a logarithm. The strategy is to convert such an equation into one of the form and then to solve for using the function.

For example, the equation
: formula_93
(where is an unknown real number) can be solved by rewriting it as
: formula_94

This last equation has the desired form and the solutions for real &quot;x&quot; are:
: formula_95
and thus:
: formula_96

Generally, the solution to
: formula_97
is:
: formula_98
where &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are complex constants, with &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; not equal to zero, and the &quot;W&quot; function is of any integer order.

=== Inviscid flows ===
Applying the unusual accelerating traveling-wave Ansatz in the form of formula_99 (where formula_100, formula_101, a, x and t are the density, the reduced variable, the acceleration, the spatial and the temporal variables) the fluid density of the corresponding Euler equation can be given with the help of the W function. 

=== Viscous flows ===
Granular and debris flow fronts and deposits, and the fronts of viscous fluids in natural events and in laboratory experiments can be described by using the Lambert–Euler omega function as follows:
: formula_102
where is the debris flow height, is the channel downstream position, is the unified model parameter consisting of several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient.

In pipe flow, the Lambert W function is part of the explicit formulation of the Colebrook equation for finding the Darcy friction factor. This factor is used to determine the pressure drop through a straight run of pipe when the flow is turbulent.

=== Time-dependent flow in simple branch hydraulic systems ===
The principal branch of the Lambert function is employed in the field of mechanical engineering, in the study of time dependent transfer of Newtonian fluids between two reservoirs with varying free surface levels, using centrifugal pumps. The Lambert function provided an exact solution to the flow rate of fluid in both the laminar and turbulent regimes: 
formula_103
where formula_104 is the initial flow rate and formula_105 is time.

=== Neuroimaging ===
The Lambert function is employed in the field of neuroimaging for linking cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption changes within a brain voxel, to the corresponding blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal.

=== Chemical engineering ===
The Lambert function is employed in the field of chemical engineering for modeling the porous electrode film thickness in a glassy carbon based supercapacitor for electrochemical energy storage. The Lambert function provides an exact solution for a gas phase thermal activation process where growth of carbon film and combustion of the same film compete with each other.

=== Crystal growth ===
In the crystal growth, the negative principal of the Lambert W-function can be used to calculate the distribution coefficient, formula_106, and solute concentration in the melt, formula_107, from the Scheil equation:
: formula_108

=== Materials science ===
The Lambert function is employed in the field of epitaxial film growth for the determination of the critical dislocation onset film thickness. This is the calculated thickness of an epitaxial film, where due to thermodynamic principles the film will develop crystallographic dislocations in order to minimise the elastic energy stored in the films. Prior to application of Lambert for this problem, the critical thickness had to be determined via solving an implicit equation. Lambert turns it in an explicit equation for analytical handling with ease.

=== Semiconductor ===
It was shown that a W-function describes the relation between voltage, current and resistance in a diode. 

=== Porous media ===
The Lambert function has been employed in the field of fluid flow in porous media to model the tilt of an interface separating two gravitationally segregated fluids in a homogeneous tilted porous bed of constant dip and thickness where the heavier fluid, injected at the bottom end, displaces the lighter fluid that is produced at the same rate from the top end. The principal branch of the solution corresponds to stable displacements while the −1 branch applies if the displacement is unstable with the heavier fluid running underneath the lighter fluid.

=== Bernoulli numbers and Todd genus ===
The equation (linked with the generating functions of Bernoulli numbers and Todd genus):
: formula_109
can be solved by means of the two real branches and :
: formula_110

This application shows that the branch difference of the function can be employed in order to solve other transcendental equations.

=== Statistics ===
The centroid of a set of histograms defined with respect to the symmetrized Kullback–Leibler divergence (also called the Jeffreys divergence ) has a closed form using the Lambert function.

=== Pooling of tests for infectious diseases ===
Solving for the optimal group size to pool tests so that at least one individual is infected involves the Lambert function.

=== Exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation ===
The Lambert function appears in a quantum-mechanical potential, which affords the fifth – next to those of the harmonic oscillator plus centrifugal, the Coulomb plus inverse square, the Morse, and the inverse square root potential – exact solution to the stationary one-dimensional Schrödinger equation in terms of the confluent hypergeometric functions. The potential is given as
: formula_111
A peculiarity of the solution is that each of the two fundamental solutions that compose the general solution of the Schrödinger equation is given by a combination of two confluent hypergeometric functions of an argument proportional to
: formula_112

The Lambert function also appears in the exact solution for the bound state energy of the one dimensional Schrödinger equation with a Double Delta Potential.

=== Exact solution of QCD coupling constant ===
In Quantum chromodynamics, the quantum field theory of the Strong interaction, the coupling constant formula_113 is computed perturbatively, the order n corresponding to Feynman diagrams including n quantum loops. The first order, , solution is exact (at that order) and analytical. At higher orders, , there is no exact and analytical solution and one typically uses an iterative method to furnish an approximate solution. However, for second order, , the Lambert function provides an exact (if non-analytical) solution.

=== Exact solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations ===
In the Schwarzschild metric solution of the Einstein vacuum equations, the function is needed to go from the Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates to the Schwarzschild coordinates. For this reason, it also appears in the construction of the Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates.

=== Resonances of the delta-shell potential ===
The s-wave resonances of the delta-shell potential can be written exactly in terms of the Lambert function.

=== Thermodynamic equilibrium ===
If a reaction involves reactants and products having heat capacities that are constant with temperature then the equilibrium constant obeys
: formula_114
for some constants , , and . When (equal to ) is not zero the value or values of can be found where equals a given value as follows, where can be used for .
: formula_115

If and have the same sign there will be either two solutions or none (or one if the argument of is exactly ). (The upper solution may not be relevant.) If they have opposite signs, there will be one solution.

=== Phase separation of polymer mixtures ===
In the calculation of the phase diagram of thermodynamically incompatible polymer mixtures according to the Edmond-Ogston model, the solutions for binodal and tie-lines are formulated in terms of Lambert functions.

=== Wien&#x27;s displacement law in a &quot;D&quot;-dimensional universe ===
Wien&#x27;s displacement law is expressed as formula_116. With formula_117 and formula_118, where formula_119 is the spectral energy energy density, one finds formula_120, where formula_121 is the number of degrees of freedom for spatial translation. The solution formula_122 shows that the spectral energy density is dependent on the dimensionality of the universe.

=== AdS/CFT correspondence ===
The classical finite-size corrections to the dispersion relations of giant magnons, single spikes and GKP strings can be expressed in terms of the Lambert function.

=== Epidemiology ===
In the limit of the SIR model, the proportion of susceptible and recovered individuals has a solution in terms of the Lambert function.

=== Determination of the time of flight of a projectile ===
The total time of the journey of a projectile which experiences air resistance proportional to its velocity can be determined in exact form by using the Lambert function.

=== Electromagnetic surface wave propagation ===
The transcendental equation that appears in the determination of the propagation wave number of an electromagnetic axially symmetric surface wave (a low-attenuation single TM01 mode) propagating in a cylindrical metallic wire gives rise to an equation like (where and clump together the geometrical and physical factors of the problem), which is solved by the Lambert function. The first solution to this problem, due to Sommerfeld &quot;circa&quot; 1898, already contained an iterative method to determine the value of the Lambert function.

=== Orthogonal trajectories of real ellipses ===
The family of ellipses formula_123 centered at formula_124 is parameterized by eccentricity formula_125. The orthogonal trajectories of this family are given by the differential equation formula_126 whose general solution is the family formula_127formula_128.

Generalizations of the Lambert function include:
Applications of the Lambert function in fundamental physical problems are not exhausted even for the standard case expressed in () as seen recently in the area of atomic, molecular, and optical physics.

== Numerical evaluation ==
The function may be approximated using Newton&#x27;s method, with successive approximations to (so ) being

The function may also be approximated using Halley&#x27;s method,
: formula_131
given in Corless et al. to compute .

For real formula_132, it may be approximated by the quadratic-rate recursive formula of R. Iacono and J.P. Boyd:

** if formula_138 formula_139
** if formula_140 formula_141 
* For the branch formula_142

* if formula_136 (Theorem 2.4): formula_148
* if formula_149 (Theorem 2.9): formula_150
* if formula_140
** for the principal branch formula_152 (Theorem 2.17): formula_153
** for the branch formula_154(Theorem 2.23): formula_155
Toshio Fukushima has presented a fast method for approximating the real valued parts of the principal and secondary branches of the function without using any iteration. In this method the function is evaluated as a conditional switch of rational functions on transformed variables:
formula_156
formula_157
where , , and are transformations of :
: formula_158.

Here formula_159, formula_160, formula_161, and formula_162 are rational functions whose coefficients for different -values are listed in the referenced paper together with the formula_163 values that determine the subdomains. With higher degree polynomials in these rational functions the method can approximate the function more accurately.

For example, when formula_164, formula_165 can be approximated to 24 bits of accuracy on 64-bit floating point values as formula_166 where is defined with the transformation above and the coefficients formula_167 and formula_104 are given in the table below.
Fukushima also offers an approximation with 50 bits of accuracy on 64-bit floats that uses 8th- and 7th-degree polynomials.

<text>Jay or James Arthur &quot;Jimmy&quot; Rogers (June 3, 1924December 19, 1997) was an American Chicago blues singer, guitarist and harmonica player, best known for his work as a member of Muddy Waters&#x27;s band in the early 1950s. He also had a solo career and recorded several popular blues songs, including &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; (now a blues standard), &quot;Chicago Bound&quot;, &quot;Walking by Myself&quot; (his sole R&amp;B chart appearance), and &quot;Rock This House&quot;. He withdrew from the music industry at the end of the 1950s, but returned to recording and touring in the 1970s.

==Career==
Rogers was born Jay or James Arthur Lane in Ruleville, Mississippi, on June 3, 1924. He was raised in Atlanta and Memphis. He adopted his stepfather&#x27;s surname. He learned to play the harmonica with his childhood friend Snooky Pryor, and as a teenager he took up the guitar. He played professionally in East St. Louis, Illinois, with Robert Lockwood, Jr., among others. Rogers moved to Chicago in the mid-1940s. By 1946, he had recorded as a harmonica player and singer for the Harlem record label, run by J. Mayo Williams. Rogers&#x27;s name did not appear on the record, which was mislabeled as the work of Memphis Slim and His Houserockers.

In 1947, Rogers, Muddy Waters and Little Walter began playing together, forming Waters&#x27;s first band in Chicago (sometimes referred to as the Headcutters or the Headhunters, because of their practice of stealing jobs from other local bands). The band members recorded and released music credited to each of them as solo artists. The band defined the sound of the nascent Chicago blues style (more specifically, South Side Chicago blues). Rogers recorded several sides of his own with small labels in Chicago, but none were released at the time. He began to achieve success as a solo artist in 1950, with the song &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot;, released by Chess Records, but he stayed in Waters&#x27;s band until 1954. In the mid-1950s he had several successful records released by Chess, most of them featuring either Little Walter or Big Walter Horton on harmonica, notably &quot;Walking by Myself&quot;. In the late 1950s, as interest in the blues waned, he gradually withdrew from the music industry.

In the early 1960s, Rogers briefly worked as a member of Howling Wolf&#x27;s band, before quitting the music business altogether for almost a decade. He worked as a taxicab driver and owned a clothing store, which burned down in the 1968 Chicago riots following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Rogers gradually began performing in public again, and in 1971, when fashions made him somewhat popular in Europe, he began occasionally touring and recording, including a 1977 session with Waters which resulted in the album &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;. By 1982, Rogers was again a full-time solo artist. He continued touring and recording albums until his death.

In 1995, Rogers was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame. His song &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; was inducted by the organization in 2016 as a &quot;Classic of Blues Recording&quot;, which identified it as a blues standard.

Rogers died of colon cancer in Chicago in 1997. He was survived by his son, Jimmy D. Lane, a guitarist, record producer and recording engineer for Blue Heaven Studios and APO Records.

<text>Pitchshifter (originally Pitch Shifter) are an English industrial rock band from Nottingham, formed in 1989. The band was started by lead guitarist and programmer Johnny A. Carter, and bassist and vocalist Mark Clayden. The band&#x27;s early material was characterized for its gritty industrial metal sound with downtuned guitars and the use of drum machines, and has been cited as one of the originators of the genre along with Godflesh. With later albums the group&#x27;s music became increasingly more melodic and strongly influenced by nu metal and drum and bass; particularly evident of their 1998 release &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot;, which has been compared with groups like The Prodigy.

Although Pitchshifter has found little mainstream success, the band managed to gain a platinum certification with the release of the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; soundtrack. Since its formation, the band has released six studio albums, three EPs and eight music videos. The band has played in various festivals around the world including Ozzfest, Phoenix Festival and Damnation Festival.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Industrial&quot; (1989–1991)===
Pitchshifter was formed in 1989 (initially spelled Pitch Shifter) by guitarist and programmer Johnny Carter and bassist Mark Clayden, later joined by Stu Toolin, and then Jon &quot;JS&quot; Clayden (Mark Clayden&#x27;s brother). During this time, the band played with local bands and soon gained attention of the Peaceville Records. During this time, JS went to live in France to sell paintings.

They have cited major influences as Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Metallica, Nine Inch Nails, Led Zeppelin, The Cure, The Doors, The Sex Pistols, The Ramones, and Ministry.

During 1990, the band started recording their début album, &quot;Industrial&quot;, with the main vocalist being Mark Clayden instead of JS, who contributed with backing vocals. The band later went on a small tour with bands like Napalm Death.

===&quot;Submit&quot;, &quot;Desensitized&quot; and Phoenix Festival (1992–1995)===
The band later joined the British label Earache Records where they released their mini-album/EP &quot;Submit&quot;. Later, Stuart Toolin left the band, and the band hired Matt Godfrey to fill his place for some shows. Matt later left the band and they hired drummer D.J. Walters, now being a four-piece band. Later, the band released their second album, &quot;Desensitized&quot;.

The band played at the Phoenix Festival in Long Marston, England, in 1995. The band&#x27;s manager, armed with a tractor, arranged for an enormous crop circle replica of the band&#x27;s famous &quot;eye&quot; symbol to appear in the adjoining field to the festival site during the night prior to their performance there. The crowd&#x27;s enthusiasm for the band when they performed was so high that they rushed the stage, making Pitchshifter&#x27;s performance the first in the history of the festival to be stopped early.

===&quot;The Remix War&quot; and &quot;Infotainment?&quot; (1995–1996)===
The band later released the remix album &quot;The Remix War&quot;, which had appearances from other groups like Biohazard, Therapy? and Gunshot. The band then started working on the third album, &quot;Infotainment?&quot; and later played at the Dynamo Open Air. The band later left Earache and joined Geffen Records.

===Spelling change and &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot; (1997–1999)===

During this time, the band changed the spelling of their name from &#x27;Pitch Shifter&#x27; to &#x27;Pitchshifter&#x27;, and recruited former The Prodigy live guitarist Jim Davies, with the band returning to their five-piece form. The band later released their single &quot;Genius&quot;, which was later included in &quot;Test Drive 5&quot; and the &quot;Mortal Kombat: Annihilation&quot; soundtrack, which helped the band to gain platinum recognition.

In 1998, the band released their fourth album &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot;, which is their best selling album, selling around 60,000 copies in the U.S. The band later played in Ozzfest 1998 and Livid in support of their album. During 1999, they played on Reading Festival and again at Dynamo.

===&quot;Deviant&quot; (2000–2001)===
In 2000, founder Johnny Carter and drummer D.J. Walters left the band, and the band hired guitarist Matt Grundy and drummer Jason Bowld. The band later released their fifth album &quot;Deviant&quot;, which had appearances from drummer John Stanier and Jello Biafra. The band played in that year&#x27;s Ozzfest. The cover used a picture of one of Gee Vaucher&#x27;s Paintings, who did artwork for Crass and Carcass. The painting shows a cross between the Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth II. Due to outrage over the use of a caricature of the Pope, the album was banned in Poland. The band apologized for the artwork and changed it.

===&quot;PSI&quot; and hiatus (2002–2003)===
Live rhythm guitarist Matt Grundy announced his departure from the band in January 2002. The following month, Pitchshifter played their first show of the year at Ministry of Sound (London). This show marked the debut for guitarist Dan Rayner whom, along with his brother Tim, had previously worked with the band in 2001 as an additional programmer for the album &quot;PSI&quot;. This time serving as the group&#x27;s touring rhythm guitar player (switching to live lead guitar in 2003). &quot;PSI&quot; - the sixth studio album was released on May 7, 2002. The band then went to a few more shows until their last show in 2003 when the band went on an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;.

===Side projects (2003–2006)===

During this time, Jim Davies returned to The Prodigy, while Dan went to work on Drawbacks, with his brother Tim Rayner, who later joined Pitchshifter as well. Jon formed the alternative rock group Doheny with former The Cult guitarist Billy Morrison. Mark later left The Blueprint and with Jason, they formed This Is Menace, a supergroup featuring members from various other bands including Carcass, Napalm Death, Sikth, Send More Paramedics, Funeral for a Friend and earthtone9.

Doheny later broke up and JS went to form his own label, &quot;PSI Records&quot;, and in 2003 released the compilation album &quot;Bootlegged, Distorted, Remixed and Uploaded&quot; and the DVD &quot;P.S.I.entology&quot;. In 2005, This Is Menace released their début album &quot;No End in Sight&quot; through PSI Records.

During this time as well, Jon worked as a teacher at the Los Angeles Recording School teaching Music Business Communications and was a featured member of Pigface during the supergroup&#x27;s 2003 United II tour of the US. During the tour, he performed vocals on songs including Pigface&#x27;s &quot;Insect/Suspect&quot; and Pitchshifter&#x27;s classic &quot;Genius.&quot;

===Return and &quot;None for All and All for One&quot; (2006–2008)===
During late 2006, there were rumours that band was going to return, which were later confirmed and the band announced the &quot;Back From the Dead&quot; tour, supported by various bands including Funeral for a Friend. Davies did not return to the band to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Tim Rayner. The band released the &quot;None for All and All for One&quot; EP, with some copies given away for free in certain shows. There were some rumours that the band was working on a new album, but the band has denied.

In 2008, the band along with Carcass and Cathedral, headlined the Damnation Festival.

===Hiatus (2009–2018)===

In 2009, the band announced in their official website that they were working on a new album. Frontman JS Clayden stated that &quot;It&#x27;s been refreshing to get back in the demo studio. We are taking this record in a few places we haven&#x27;t been before in terms of guitar work. Brian Harrah [Professional Murder Music and Tura Satana] is writing with me on guitar at The Manor Studios, and Jason is jamming at his place. So far we are having a blast and kicking ass. There are a few new moves in terms of song timing and vocals that have us all jazzed. I guess you&#x27;ll just have to wait and see what we came up with.&quot; In late 2009, guitarist Tim Rayner was diagnosed with b cell lymphoma while on vacation in Australia and underwent treatment. In February 2010, he arrived in the UK and started radiotherapy. The band headlined the Wakefield Rock Festival on 15 May 2010.

The band&#x27;s statement, made on their website in 2011, is &quot;We&#x27;re excited to be back in the studio. Looking at a 2012 release right now; but we&#x27;re not under any pressure to finish on someone else&#x27;s deadline - so we&#x27;ll do it right and finish on our own schedule.&quot; However, no further updates were published, and in July 2015, the official website&#x27;s domain had been purchased and replaced with a Japanese website unrelated to the band; years later, JS Clayden admitted that &quot;we carried the website for such a long time that it felt like a burden being lifted to let it go&quot;.

===Reunion tour and occasional shows (2018–present)===

In June 2016, the band tweeted &quot;Looking at some live shows in Feb 2018 in the UK&quot;. This was followed by an announcement in April 2018 that the band would reunite for a short tour the following November to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the &quot;www.pitchshifter.com&quot; album; Simon Hutchby from earthtone9 would be replacing Jason Bowld on drums, as Bowld could not break away his commitments with Bullet for My Valentine. When asked about a longer term reunion, J.S. Clayden emphasized that the current band members live in different cities and countries. Select demo material from the band&#x27;s would-be seventh album, &quot;Sprint Finish&quot;, was released on the band&#x27;s Bandcamp page.

In January 2020, the band announced they were releasing a &quot;redux&quot; of &quot;Un-United Kingdom&quot;, with additional guest vocals, to coincide with the day of Brexit. Jason Bowld and Mark Clayden guested on former guitarist Jim Davies&#x27; album &quot;Headwars&quot;.

In July 2020, the band released a re-recorded version of &quot;Everything&#x27;s Fucked&quot; for the EFKD 2020 EP. Later that year, the band successfully crowdfunded though Kickstarter a retrospective diary book entitled &quot;Chasing The Broken White Line&quot;, chronicling the band&#x27;s 1998 world tour; a sequel book, &quot;Tokyo or Bust&quot;, was announced in 2022.

In July 2023, the band re-joined to perform two shows in the UK, one of them as part of the 2000trees festival.

<text>In Maya mythology, Cabaguil (meaning &quot;Heart of the Sky&quot;) was a solar god who assisted in the creation of human beings.

== Creation ==

In Mayan society, gods were seen as the source of life. According to the creation myth in &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, the universe began as an undifferentiated chaos. Later, the spiritual powers became separated into deities and the universe was split into three entities: the heavens, the earth and the underworld. These entities were ruled by the gods Tzacol, Bitol, Alom and Oaholom. Tepeu (god of lightning and fire), Gukumatz (god of wind and rain), and Cabaguil (the solar god) joined them to form a council. Together, they created plants and animals. Lastly, the deities created human beings to recognize and worship them. Other deities were also involved in the process, as they only succeeded on the third attempt. Cabaguil was also referred to as &quot;Heart of the Sky&quot; making him one of the most important sky gods.

<text>This is a list of &quot;maria&quot; (large, dark, basaltic plains) on the Moon. It includes other basaltic plains, including the one &quot;oceanus&quot; as well as features known by the names &quot;lacus&quot;, &quot;palus&quot; and &quot;sinus&quot;. The modern system of lunar nomenclature was introduced in 1651 by Giovanni Battista Riccioli.
Riccioli&#x27;s map of the Moon was drawn by Francesco Maria Grimaldi, who has a crater named after him. A related set of features are the Lunar &quot;lacus&quot; (singular also &quot;lacus&quot;, Latin for &quot;lake&quot;), which are smaller basaltic plains of similar origin. A related set of features are the &quot;sinus&quot; (singular &quot;sinus&quot;, Latin for &quot;bay&quot;) and &quot;paludes&quot; (singular &quot;palus&quot; , Latin &quot;palūs, palūdēs&quot; &quot;marsh&quot;).

There was also a region on the Lunar farside that was briefly misidentified as a mare and named Mare Desiderii (Sea of Desire). It is no longer recognized. Other former? maria include: Mare Parvum (&quot;Small Sea&quot;), immediately to the east of Inghirami; Mare Incognitum (&quot;Unknown Sea&quot;); Mare Novum (&quot;New Sea&quot;), northeast of Plutarch; and Mare Struve (&quot;Struve&#x27;s Sea&quot;), near Messala. Some sources also list a Palus Nebularum (Latin &quot;palūs nebulārum&quot; &quot;Marsh of Mists&quot;) at 38.0° N, 1.0° E. However, the designation for this feature has not been officially recognized by the IAU.

<doc id="92492" wikidata="Q24251468" url="?curid=92492" title="Chumash people">
<text>The Chumash are a Native American people of the central and southern coastal regions of California, in portions of what is now Kern, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties, extending from Morro Bay in the north to Malibu in the south to Mt Pinos in the east. Their territory includes three of the Channel Islands: Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel; the smaller island of Anacapa was likely inhabited seasonally due to the lack of a consistent water source.

Modern place names with Chumash origins include Malibu, Nipomo, Lompoc, Ojai, Pismo Beach, Point Mugu, Port Hueneme, Piru, Lake Castaic, Saticoy, Simi Valley, and Somis. Archaeological research shows that the Chumash people have deep roots in the Santa Barbara Channel area and have lived along the southern California coast for millennia.

==History==

===Prior to European contact (pre-1542)===
Indigenous peoples have lived along the California coast for at least 11,000 years. Sites of the Millingstone Horizon date from 7000 to 4500 BC and show evidence of a subsistence system focused on the processing of seeds with &quot;metates&quot; and &quot;manos&quot;. 

During that time, people used bipointed bone objects and line to catch fish and began making beads from shells of the marine olive snail (&quot;Callianax biplicata&quot;). The name Chumash means &quot;bead maker&quot; or &quot;seashell people&quot; being that they originated near the Santa Barbara coast. The Chumash tribes near the coast benefited most with the &quot;close juxtaposition of a variety of marine and terrestrial habitats, intensive upwelling in coastal waters, and intentional burning of the landscape made the Santa Barbara Channel region one of the most resource abundant places on the planet.&quot;

While droughts were not uncommon in the centuries of the first millennium AD, a population explosion occurred with the coming of the medieval warm period. &quot;Marine productivity soared between 950 and 1300 as natural upwelling intensified off the coast.&quot; Before the mission period, the Chumash lived in over 150 independent villages, speaking variations of the same language. Much of their culture consisted of basketry, bead manufacturing and trading, cuisine of local abalone and clam, herbalism using local herbs to produce teas and medical reliefs, rock art, and the scorpion tree. 

The scorpion tree was significant to the Chumash, as shown in its arborglyph: a carving depicting a six-legged creature with a headdress including a crown and two spheres. The shamans participated in the carving which was used in observations of the stars and in part of the Chumash calendar. The Chumash resided between the Santa Ynez Mountains and the California coasts where a bounty of resources could be found. The tribe lived in an area of three environments: the interior, the coast, and the Northern Channel Islands. 

The interior is composed of the land outside the coast and spanning the wide plains, rivers, and mountains. The coast covers the cliffs, land close to the ocean, and the areas of the ocean from which the Chumash harvested. The Northern Channel Islands lie off the coast of the Chumash territory. All of the California coastal-interior has a Mediterranean climate due to the incoming ocean winds. The mild temperatures, save for winter, made gathering easy; during the cold months, the Chumash harvested what they could and supplemented their diets with stored foods. What villagers gathered and traded during the seasons changed depending on where they resided. With coasts populated by masses of species of fish and land densely covered by trees and animals, the Chumash had a diverse array of food.

Abundant resources and a winter rarely harsh enough to cause concern meant the tribe lived a sedentary lifestyle in addition to a subsistence existence. Villages in the three aforementioned areas contained remains of sea mammals, indicating that trade networks existed for moving materials throughout the Chumash territory. The Chumash were connected to extensive trade networks reaching into modern-day Arizona, from which pottery and textiles were traded in exchange for shell beads. The emergence of this trade network within the Chumash territory was facilitated by the existence of three distinct Chumash ecological groups including the island, coastal, and mainland Chumash. Access to distinct resources for these different groups made inter-Chumash trade a large part of life. Villages along the mainland coast emerged as intermediaries between groups. 

The closer a village was to the ocean, the greater its reliance on maritime resources. Due to advanced canoe designs, coastal and island people could procure fish and aquatic mammals from farther out. Shellfish were a good source of nutrition: relatively easy to find and abundant. Many of the favored varieties grew in tidal zones. Shellfish grew in abundance during winter to early spring; their proximity to shore made collection easier. Some of the consumed species included mussels, abalone, and a wide array of clams. Haliotis rufescens (red abalone) was harvested along the Central California coast in the pre-contact era. The Chumash and other California Indians also used red abalone shells to make a variety of fishhooks, beads, ornaments, and other artifacts.

Ocean animals such as otters and seals were thought to be the primary meal of coastal tribes people, but recent evidence shows the aforementioned trade networks exchanged oceanic animals for terrestrial foods from the interior. Any village could acquire fish, but the coastal and island communities specialized in catching not just smaller fish, but also the massive catches such as swordfish. This feat, difficult even for today&#x27;s technology, was made possible by the tomol plank canoe. Its design allowed for the capture of deepwater fish, and it facilitated trade routes between villages.

Some researchers believe that the Chumash may have been visited by Polynesians between AD 400 and 800, nearly 1,000 years before Christopher Columbus reached the Americas. The Chumash advanced sewn-plank canoe design, used throughout Polynesia but unknown in North America except by those two tribes, is cited as the chief evidence for contact. Comparative linguistics may provide evidence as the Chumash word for &quot;sewn-plank canoe&quot;, &quot;tomolo&#x27;o&quot;, may have been derived from &quot;kumula&#x27;au&quot;, the Polynesian word for the redwood logs used in that construction. However, the language comparison is generally considered tentative. Furthermore, the development of the Chumash plank canoe is fairly well represented in the archaeological record and spans several centuries. The concept is rejected by most archaeologists who work with the Chumash culture, and there is no evidence of a genetic legacy.

Before contact with Europeans, coastal Chumash relied less on terrestrial resources than they did on maritime; vice versa for interior Chumash. Regardless, they consumed similar land resources. Like many other tribes, deer were the most important land mammal the Chumash pursued; deer were consumed in varying amounts across all regions, which cannot be said for other terrestrial animals. Interior Chumash placed greater value on the deer, to the extent of developing unique hunting practices for them.

They dressed as deer and grazed alongside the animals until the hunters were in range to use their arrows. Even Chumash close to the ocean pursued deer, though in fewer numbers. The villages also relied on smaller animals, such as rabbits and birds, to supplement their meat needs. Plant foods composed the rest of the Chumash diet, especially acorns, which were the staple food despite the work needed to remove their inherent toxins. They could be ground into a paste that was easy to eat and store for years. Coast live oak provided the best acorns; their mush would usually be served unseasoned with meat and fish.

===Spanish contact and the mission period (1542–1834)===

The maritime explorer Juan Cabrillo was the first European to make contact with the coastal Alta Californian tribes in the year 1542. Cabrillo died and was buried on San Miguel Island, but his men brought back a diary that contained the names and population counts for many Chumash villages, such as Mikiw. Spain claimed what is now California from that time forward, but did not return to settle until 1769, when the first Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived with the double purpose of Christianizing the Native Americans and facilitating Spanish colonization. By the end of 1770, missions and military presidios had been founded at San Diego to the south of Chumash lands and Monterey to their north.

With the arrival of the Europeans &quot;came a series of unprecedented blows to the Chumash and their traditional lifeways. Anthropologists, historians, and other scholars have long been interested in documenting the collision of cultures that accompanied the European exploration and colonization of the Americas.&quot; In 1770, Spain settled in Chumash territory. They founded colonies, bringing in missionaries to begin evangelizing Native Americans in the region by forcing Chumash villages into numerous missions that emerged along the coast.

The Chumash people moved from their villages to the Franciscan missions between 1772 and 1817. Mission San Luis Obispo, established in 1772, was the first mission in Chumash-speaking lands, as well as the northernmost of the five missions ever constructed in those lands. Next established, in 1782, was Mission San Buenaventura on the Pacific Coast near the mouth of the Santa Clara River. Mission Santa Barbara, also on the coast, and facing out to the Channel Islands, was established in 1786.

Mission La Purisima Concepción was founded along the inland route from Santa Barbara north to San Luis Obispo in 1789. The final Franciscan mission to be constructed in native Chumash territory was Santa Ynez, founded in 1804 on the Santa Ynez River with a seed population of Chumash people from Missions La Purisima and Santa Barbara. To the southeast, Mission San Fernando, founded in 1798 in the land of Takic Shoshonean speakers, also took in large numbers of Chumash speakers from the middle Santa Clara River valley. While most of the Chumash people joined one mission or another between 1772 and 1806, a significant portion of the native inhabitants of the Channel Islands did not move to the mainland missions until 1816. 

Radiocarbon dating of artifacts on the southernmost of the Channel Islands, San Clemente Island, suggests that the Chumash people lived without significant contact from Spanish settlers and missionaries until the 1870’s. This island shows a clear lack of Spanish influence on its archaeology up until this point. Because of its remoteness, it was perhaps the last Chumash area to be colonized.

===Mexican era (1834–1848)===
Mexico seized control of the missions in 1834. Tribespeople either fled into the interior, attempted farming for themselves and were driven off the land, or were enslaved by the new administrators. Many found highly exploitative work on large Mexican ranches. After 1849, most Chumash land was lost due to theft by Americans and a declining population, due to the effects of violence and disease.

The remaining Chumash began to lose their cohesive identity. In 1855, a small piece of land (120 acres) was set aside for just over 100 remaining Chumash Indians near Santa Ynez mission. This land ultimately became the only Chumash reservation, although Chumash individuals and families also continued to live throughout their former territory in southern California. Today, the Santa Ynez band lives at and near Santa Ynez. The Chumash population was between roughly 10,000 and 18,000 in the late 18th century. In 1990, 213 Indians lived on the Santa Ynez Reservation.

===American era (1848–present)===

The Chumash reservation, established in 1901, encompasses 127 acres. No native Chumash speak their own language since Mary Yee, the last Barbareño speaker, died in 1965. Today, the Chumash are estimated to have a population of 5,000 members. Many current members can trace their ancestors to the five islands of Channel Islands National Park.

Beginning in the 1970s, neo-Chumash arose, tracing their lineage nearly completely from the descendants of Spanish colonists to the domain of the initial Chumash people. They promote traditions of the Chumash, and are recognized locally. Their cultural assumption has been criticized by some, but is supported by others.

The first modern &quot;tomol&quot; was built and launched in 1976 as a result of a joint venture between Quabajai Chumash of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. Its name is &quot;Helek/Xelex&quot;, the Chumash word for falcon. The Brotherhood of the Tomol was revived and her crew paddled and circumnavigated around the Santa Barbara Channel Islands on a 10-day journey, stopping on three of the islands. The second &quot;tomol&quot;, the &quot;Elye&#x27;wun&quot; (&quot;swordfish&quot;), was launched in 1997.

On September 9, 2001, the first &quot;crossing&quot; in the Chumash tomol, from the mainland to Channel Islands, was sponsored by the Chumash Maritime Association and the Barbareño Chumash Council. Several Chumash bands and descendants gathered on the island of Limuw (the Chumash name for Santa Cruz Island) to witness the &quot;Elye&#x27;wun&quot; being paddled from the mainland to Santa Cruz Island.

Their journey was documented in the short film &quot;Return to Limuw&quot; produced by the Ocean Channel for the Chumash Maritime Association, Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary, and the Santa Barbara Maritime Museum. The channel crossings have become a yearly event hosted by the Barbareño Chumash Council. The Santa Ynez Band of Chumash is a federally recognized Chumash tribe. They have the Santa Ynez Reservation located in Santa Barbara County, near Santa Ynez. Chumash people are also enrolled in the Tejon Indian Tribe of California.

In addition to the Santa Ynez Band, the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation and the Barbareño/Ventureño Band of Mission Indians are attempting to gain federal recognition. Other Chumash tribal groups include the Northern Chumash Tribal Council, descendants from the San Luis Obispo area, and the Barbareño Chumash Council, descendants from the greater Santa Barbara area. The publication of the first Chumash dictionary took place in April 2008. Six hundred pages long and containing 4,000 entries, the &quot;Samala-English Dictionary&quot; includes more than 2,000 illustrations. The documentary film &quot;6 Generations: A Chumash Family History&quot; features Mary Yee, the last speaker of the Barbareño Chumash language.

====Produce initiative====
In December 2010, the Foodbank of Santa Barbara County was the recipient of a $10,000 grant from the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians Foundation to support expansion of the Produce Initiative. The Produce Initiative puts an emphasis on supplying fruits and vegetables to 264 local nonprofits and food programs. The foodbank distributes produce free of charge to member agencies to encourage healthy eating. Expanding produce accessibility to children is important to the foodbank and the newly operating Kids’ Farmers&#x27; Market program, an extension of the Produce Initiative, achieves that goal.

The program trains volunteers to teach kids in after-school programs nutrition education and hands-on cooking instructions. This program currently operates at 12 sites countywide, including in the Santa Ynez Valley. After the children cook and eat a healthy meal, they get to take home a bag full of fresh produce, where they can help feed and cook for the whole family. Obesity in children is a major health problem prevalent among Native Americans.

To promote sustainable agriculture and healthy diets, the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Environmental Office and Education Departments&#x27; after-school program planted a community garden, which provided vegetables to the Elder&#x27;s Council, beginning in 2013. The Santa Ynez Valley Fruit and Vegetable Rescue, also known as Veggie Rescue, is another effort to improve food sourcing for the Santa Ynez.

==Worldviews and cosmology==
Chumash worldview is centered on the belief &quot;that considers all things to be, in varying measure, alive, intelligent, dangerous, and sacred.&quot; According to Thomas Blackburn in &quot;December&#x27;s Child: A Book of Chumash Oral Narratives&quot; published in 1980, the Chumash do not have a creation story like Tongva, Acjachemen, Quechnajuichom, and other Takic-speaking peoples. Rather, as summarized by Susan Suntree, &quot;they assume that the universe with its three, or in some versions five, layers has always been here. 

Human beings occupy the Middle Region, which rests upon two giant snakes. Chronological time is unimportant, though the past is divided into two sections: the universal flood that caused the First People to become the natural world and, thereafter the creation of human beings, the arrival of the Europeans, and the devastating consequences that followed.&quot; 

The middle region (sometimes referred to as &quot;″antap&quot;), where humans and spirits of this world live and where shamans could travel in vision quests, is interconnected with the lower world (&quot;C&#x27;oyinahsup&quot;) through the springs and marsh areas and is connected to the upper world through the mountains. In the lower world live snakes, frogs, salamanders. The world trembles or has earthquakes when the snakes which support the world writhe. 

Water creatures are also in contact with the powers of the lower world and &quot;were often depicted in rock art perhaps to bring more water to the Chumash or to appease underworld spirits&#x27; at times of hunger or disease.&quot; &quot;Itiashap&quot; is the home of the First People. &quot;Alapay&quot; is the upper world in Chumash cosmology where the &quot;sky people&quot; lived, who play an important role in the health of the people. Principle figures of the sky world include the Sun, the Moon, Lizard, Sky Coyote, and Eagle. The Sun is the source of life and is also &quot;a source of disease and death.&quot; The Sky Coyote, also known as the Great Coyote of the Sky or &quot;Shnilemun,&quot; is considered to be a protector and according to Inseño Chumash lore, &quot;looks out for the welfare of all in the world below him&quot;. During the creation of mankind, the Sky Coyote was present among the other important cosmological figures. According to John M. Anderson in his work &quot;Chumash Demonology&quot;, the Eagle, also known as &quot;Slo’w&quot;, represents the ruler of Polaris. The Eagle also is the force that maintains momentum and order among the other stars so that they do not fall down on and destroy earth.

===Cosmology and astronomy===
The Chumash cosmology is also centered around astronomy. Rock art and arborglyphs that have been found within Chumash sites are thought to have depicted Polaris (the North Star) and Ursa Major (the Big Dipper). Specialists Rex Saint-Onge, John R. Johnson, and Joseph R. Talaugon argues in their article &quot;Archaeoastronomical Implications of a Northern Chumash Arborglyph&quot; that these two astrological entities were paramount to the Chumash belief system as well as their perception of time. It is believed that the Chumash used these constellations to determine what time of the year it was depending on the position of Ursa Major around Polaris.

==Chumash bands==
One Chumash band, the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Mission Indians of the Santa Ynez Reservation is a federally recognized tribe, and other Chumash people are enrolled in the federally recognized Tejon Indian Tribe. There are 14 bands of Chumash Indians.

* Barbareño Chumash, affiliated with the Taynayan missions and the Kashwa reservations.
* Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, their historical territory, north of Los Angeles, includes parts of the coastal counties of Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Kern, and Ventura. The Coastal band of the Chumash Nation applied for recognition in 1981.
* Cuyama Chumash, from the Cuyama Valley.
* Island Chumash, from the Channel Islands.
* Kagismuwas Chumash, from the southwesternmost region of the ancestral Chumash land. Their historical lands are now part of Vandenberg Space Force Base.
* Los Angeles Chumash, formed when members of the historic Malibu, Tejon, and Ventura bands were relocated in the 19th century.
* Malibu Chumash, from the coast of Malibu. Descendants of this band can now be found among the Ventura, Coastal, Tejon, and San Fernando Valley bands.
* Monterey Chumash, from the Monterey Peninsula.
* Samala, or Santa Ynez Chumash. The Santa Ynez Chumash people in 2012 went to federal court to regain more land. The Bureau of Indian Affairs approved the request; the land was to go toward tribal housing and a Chumash Museum and Cultural Center. Protesters and anti-tribal groups have spent approximately $2 million to disrupt or stop the land acquisition.
* San Fernando Valley Chumash, once laborers at the Mission San Fernando Rey de España. They intermarried other tribes who also worked at the mission.
* Yak Tityu Tityu Yak Tilhini Northern Chumash, homelands from coastal Avila Beach to Morro Bay. They are the northwesternmost Chumash people, located in San Luis Obispo County.
* Tecuya Chumash, most of this band of Chumash tribe were probably Kagismuwas. This band was established as an anti-colonial group, who took residence in the Tecuya Canyon along with the Tejon Chumash.
*Tejon Chumash, part of the Kern County Chumash Council. &quot;Tejon&quot; is the Spanish word for &quot;badger&quot;, and its name was given to the Tejon Rancheria.
* Ventura Chumash, lives in the traditional Chumash domain of the Owl Clan.

==Population==
Estimates for the precontact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. The anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber thought the 1770 population of the Chumash might have been about 10,000. Alan K. Brown concluded that the population was about 15,000. Sherburne F. Cook, at various times, estimated the aboriginal Chumash as 8,000, 13,650, 20,400, or 18,500.

Some scholars have suggested the Chumash population may have declined substantially during a &quot;protohistoric&quot; period (1542–1769), when intermittent contacts with the crews of Spanish ships, including those of Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo&#x27;s expedition, who wintered in the Santa Barbara Channel in AD 1542–43, brought disease and death.

The Chumash appear to have been thriving in the late 18th-century, when Spaniards first began actively colonizing the California coast. Whether the deaths began earlier with the contacts with ships&#x27; crews or later with the construction of several Spanish missions at Ventura, Santa Barbara, Lompoc, Santa Ynez, and San Luis Obispo, the Chumash were eventually devastated by the California Genocide carried out when the United States took over the territory. By 1900, their numbers had declined to just 200, while current estimates of Chumash people today range from 2,000 to 5,000.

The demographics of traditional Chumash society are quite complex. One aspect of interest is the &#x27;Aqi gender of the Chumash. &#x27;Aqi was a third Chumash gender defined by biological males that performed work and wore clothing traditionally of women. The &#x27;aqi gender appears to also be closely tied to non-procreative sexual activity, such as homosexuality. Archaeological investigation of morturary practices has provided evidence for this.

==Languages==
Several related languages under the name &quot;Chumash&quot; (from &quot;čʰumaš&quot; , meaning &quot;Santa Cruz Islander&quot;) were spoken. No native speakers remain, although the dialects are well documented in the unpublished fieldnotes of linguist John Peabody Harrington. Especially well documented are the Barbareño, Ineseño, Ventureño and Obispeño languages within the Chumashan language family, which is a language isolate. In 2010, the Šmuwič Chumash Language School was established at Wishtoyo&#x27;s Chumash Village and remained active until 2012. The language reclamation program in 2010 was initially run by Elder Johnny Moreno and his niece Deborah Sanchez. The language classes were revitalized in 2014 at American Indian Health and Services in Santa Barbara and in Santa Paula in 2016. Sanchez was the sole instructor. Classes then moved online once the COVID pandemic arrived. The traditional name for Ineseño is &quot;s&#x27;amala&quot; and the Chumash name for the Barbareño people is Šmuwič.

==Culture==
The Chumash were hunter-gatherers and were adept at fishing at the time of Spanish colonization. They are one of the relatively few New World peoples who regularly navigated the ocean (another was the Tongva, a neighboring tribe to the south). Some settlements built a plank boat (&quot;tomol&quot;), which facilitated the distribution of goods and could be used for whaling.

===Basketry===
Anthropologists have long collected Chumash baskets. Two of the largest collections are at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, and the Musée de l&#x27;Homme (Museum of Mankind) in Paris. The Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History is believed to have the largest collection of Chumash baskets.

===Bead manufacture and trading===
The Chumash of the Northern Channel Islands were at the center of an intense regional trade network. Beads made from &quot;Callianax&quot; shells were manufactured on the Channel Islands and used as a form of currency by the Chumash. Shell beads were not just a form of currency, they also played a vital role in the Chumash social system. The beads exchanges helped people build social networks, and accumulated wealth outside of food resources. This allowed the Chumash people to minimize the risk of food shortages in their tribe and were able to fall back on durable beads and their existing friends in other communities. Chumash chiefs and elite members were responsible with the redistribution of the shell beads, subsistence goods, and other items.

These shell beads were traded to neighboring groups and have been found throughout Alta California. Some items that were traded by the Chumash from the island to the Chumash mainland tribes included shell beads, digging stick weights (stone rings), and steatite Lolas (stone bowl) which originates mainly from Santa Catalina Island. The mainland tribes would in return export seeds, acorns, bows and arrows, fur, skin, roots, and baskets to the island. There was also trade from the mainland and inland areas whose items consisted of fish and beads. The interior citizens would trade fish, game, seeds, fruit, and fox-skin shawls to the coast. Fernando Librado (Chumash Elder) mentions that all the trade transactions took place on the mainland due to the location since it was between the island and the interior.

Over the course of late prehistory, millions of shell beads were manufactured and traded from Santa Cruz Island. It has been suggested that exclusive control over stone quarries used to manufacture the drills needed in bead production could have played a role in the development of social complexity in Chumash society.

The bead-making industry involved two distinct craft specializations: the production of tools used to make beads and the actual manufacturing of the beads themselves. Central to this industry was chert, a hard, fine-grained sedimentary rock. The Chumash crafted small flakes of chert into microblades, which were essential for their bead production. These microblades were then used to create drills, the tools necessary for making holes in shells, transforming them into beads. Thus, chert microlithic tools played a crucial role in the bead-making process.

The regional diversity present within the Chumash territory spawned an intricate trade system connecting the island, coastal, and mainland groups. The villages of Xaxas and Muwu emerged as the most important trade hubs for the Chumash people. Their positioning relative to coastal and mainland trade routes and resources made these villages particularly powerful within the Chumash trade ecosystem. 

===Cuisine, foodways, and subsistence===
Foods historically consumed by the Chumash include several marine species, such as black abalone, the Pacific littleneck clam, red abalone, the bent-nosed clam, ostrea lurida oysters, angular unicorn snails, and the butternut clam. Acorns, an important plant food, were ground up and cooked into a soup. They also made flour from the dried fruits of the laurel sumac. Highly prized seafood such as swordfish were caught through the use of plank canoes and were likely shared by chiefs during communal feasts.

Feasts are a ritual activity of communal consumption of large quantities of food and drinks along with dances, music, and singing. They played a large role in political and social relations for the Chumash people. The feasts would be prepared over many days, mostly by women, and would coincide with major events such as childbirth, marriages, and chiefs’ birthdays. There are accounts of feasts being held for European expeditions passing through Chumash territories.

During the time of Spanish colonialism, some diets of the Chumash people living on mission sites shifted to include European plants and animals. Evidence has been found that more sheep and cattle were consumed during the 19th century. Traditional hunting and fishing practices were still maintained alongside the addition of European livestock.

There is evidence to suggest that a seafaring, fishing economy in the Channel Islands has been around for at least 12,000 years. This can be seen through various types of fishing projectile points as well as animal remains such as seal, shellfish, and fish all found at sites across the islands by archaeologists and researchers. Coastal people of California have been maintaining their food practices in various ways for a very long time.

===Herbalism===
Herbs used in traditional Chumash medicine include thick-leaved yerba santa, used to keep airways open for proper breathing; laurel sumac, the root bark of which was used to make a herbal tea for treating dysentery; and black sage, the leaves and stems were made into a strong sun tea. This was rubbed on the painful area or used to soak one&#x27;s feet. The plant contains diterpenoids, such as aethiopinone and ursolic acid, which are known pain relievers.

The Chumash formerly practiced an initiation rite involving the use of &quot;sacred datura&quot; (&quot;mo&#x27;moy&quot; in their language). When a boy was 8 years old, his mother would give him a preparation of it to drink. This was supposed to be a spiritual challenge to help him develop the spiritual well-being required to become a man. Not all of the boys survived the poison.

===Rock art===

Remains of a developed Chumash culture, including rock paintings apparently depicting the Chumash cosmology, such as Chumash Painted Cave State Historic Park, can still be seen.

===Scorpion tree===
A centuries-old oak tree in California is considered to have a Chumash arborglyph, a carving of a six-legged creature with a headdress including a crown and two spheres. Previously thought to have been carved by cowboys, it was visited in 2007 by paleontologist Rex Saint Onge, who identified the three-foot carving as being of Chumash origin and related to other Chumash cave paintings in California. Further studies have led Saint Onge to believe these are not simply the work of Chumash, but by Chumash shamans who were conscious observers of the stars, and used these carvings to calibrate the Chumash calendar.

<doc id="92494" wikidata="Q1195112" url="?curid=92494" title="The King in Yellow">
<text>The King in Yellow is a book of short stories by American writer Robert W. Chambers, first published by F. Tennyson Neely in 1895. The British first edition was published by Chatto &amp; Windus in 1895 (316 pages).

The book contains nine short stories and a sequence of poems; while the first stories belong to the genres of supernatural horror and weird fiction, &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; progressively transitions towards a more light-hearted tone, ending with romantic stories devoid of horror or supernatural elements. The horror stories are highly esteemed, and it has been described by critics such as E. F. Bleiler, S. T. Joshi, and T. E. D. Klein as a classic in the field of the supernatural. Lin Carter called it &quot;an absolute masterpiece, probably the single greatest book of weird fantasy written in this country between the death of Poe and the rise of Lovecraft&quot;, and it was an influence on Lovecraft himself.

The book is named for the eponymous play within the stories which recurs as a motif through the first four stories, a forbidden play which induces madness in those who read it.

==Stories==
The first four stories are loosely connected by three main devices:

* A play in book form entitled &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;
* A mysterious and malevolent supernatural and gothic entity known as the King in Yellow
* An eerie symbol called the Yellow Sign

These stories are macabre in tone, centering, in keeping with the other tales, on characters who are often artists or decadents, inhabitants of the &quot;demi-monde&quot;.

The first and fourth stories, &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot;, are set in an imagined future 1920s America, whereas the second and third stories, &quot;The Mask&quot; and &quot;In the Court of the Dragon&quot;, are set in Paris. These stories are haunted by the theme: &quot;Have you found the Yellow Sign?&quot;

The macabre character gradually fades away during the remaining stories, and the last three are written in the romantic fiction style common to Chambers&#x27; later work. They are all linked to the preceding stories by their Parisian setting and their artistic protagonists.

===List of stories===

The stories in the book are:
* &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot; – a story of egotism and paranoia which carries the imagery of the book&#x27;s title.
* &quot;The Mask&quot; – a dream story of art, love, and uncanny science.
* &quot;In the Court of the Dragon&quot; – a man is pursued by a sinister church organist who is after his soul.
* &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot; – an artist is troubled by a sinister churchyard watchman who resembles a coffin worm.
* &quot;The Demoiselle d&#x27;Ys&quot; – a time travel love story.
* &quot;The Prophets&#x27; Paradise&quot; – a sequence of eerie prose poems that develop the style and theme of a quotation from the fictional play &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; that introduces &quot;The Mask&quot;.
* &quot;The Street of the Four Winds&quot; – an atmospheric tale of an artist in Paris who is drawn to a neighbor&#x27;s room by a cat; the story ends with a tragic touch.
* &quot;The Street of the First Shell&quot; – a war story set during the Siege of Paris (1870–71).
* &quot;The Street of Our Lady of the Fields&quot; – romantic American bohemians in Paris.
* &quot;Rue Barrée&quot; – romantic American bohemians in Paris, with a discordant ending that playfully reflects some of the tone of the first story.

==The play called &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;==
The fictional play &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; has at least two acts and at least three characters: Cassilda, Camilla and &quot;the Stranger&quot;, who may or may not be the titular character.

Chambers&#x27; story collection excerpts some sections from the play to introduce the book as a whole, or individual stories. For example, &quot;Cassilda&#x27;s Song&quot; comes from Act 1, Scene 2 of the play:

The short story &quot;The Mask&quot; is introduced by an excerpt from Act 1, Scene 2d:

It is also stated, in &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;, that the final moment of the first act involves the character Camilla&#x27;s &quot;agonized scream and [...] awful words echoing through the dim streets of Carcosa&quot;.

All of the excerpts come from Act I. The stories describe Act I as quite ordinary, but reading Act II drives the reader mad with the &quot;irresistible&quot; revealed truths: &quot;The very banality and innocence of the first act only allowed the blow to fall afterward with more awful effect&quot;. Even seeing the first page of the second act is enough to draw the reader in: &quot;If I had not caught a glimpse of the opening words in the second act I should never have finished it&quot; (&quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;).

Chambers usually gives only scattered hints of the contents of the full play, as in this extract from &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;:

He mentioned the establishment of the Dynasty in Carcosa, the lakes which connected Hastur, Aldebaran and the mystery of the Hyades. He spoke of Cassilda and Camilla, and sounded the cloudy depths of Demhe, and the Lake of Hali. &quot;The scolloped tatters of the King in Yellow must hide Yhtill forever&quot;, he muttered, but I do not believe Vance heard him. Then by degrees he led Vance along the ramifications of the Imperial family, to Uoht and Thale, from Naotalba and Phantom of Truth, to Aldones, and then tossing aside his manuscript and notes, he began the wonderful story of the Last King.

A similar passage occurs in &quot;The Yellow Sign&quot;, in which two protagonists have read &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;:

Night fell and the hours dragged on, but still we murmured to each other of the King and the Pallid Mask, and midnight sounded from the misty spires in the fog-wrapped city. We spoke of Hastur and of Cassilda, while outside the fog rolled against the blank window-panes as the cloud waves roll and break on the shores of Hali.

==Inspirations for &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;==
Chambers borrowed the names Carcosa, Hali and Hastur from Ambrose Bierce: specifically, his short stories &quot;An Inhabitant of Carcosa&quot; and &quot;Haïta the Shepherd&quot;. There is no strong indication that Chambers was influenced beyond liking the names. For example, Hastur is a god of shepherds in &quot;Haïta the Shepherd&quot;, but is implicitly a location in &quot;The Repairer of Reputations&quot;, listed alongside the Hyades and Aldebaran.
The Mask that the Stranger is instructed to remove but turns out not to exist at all in the excerpt from &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; play (in Chambers&#x27; short story &quot;The Mask&quot;) evokes the scene in Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; where Prince Prospero demands that the stranger dressed as the Red Death should remove his mask and robes, only to find nothing underneath. Given the recognition of that short story, this might be an inspiration or even a tribute from Chambers to Poe.

Brian Stableford has pointed out that the story &quot;The Demoiselle d&#x27;Ys&quot; was influenced by the stories of Théophile Gautier, such as &quot;Arria Marcella&quot; (1852); both Gautier and Chambers&#x27; stories feature a love affair enabled by a supernatural time slip.

== Legacy ==
=== Influence on Cthulhu Mythos ===
H. P. Lovecraft read &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; in early 1927
and included passing references to various things and places from the book—such as the Lake of Hali and the Yellow Sign—in &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1931),
one of his main Cthulhu Mythos stories. Lovecraft borrowed Chambers&#x27; method of only vaguely referring to supernatural events, entities, and places, thereby allowing his readers to imagine the horror for themselves. The play &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; effectively became another piece of occult literature in the Cthulhu Mythos alongside the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; and others.

=== &quot;True Detective&quot; ===
The first season of &quot;True Detective&quot;, a 2014 American anthology crime drama television series created by Nic Pizzolatto, references a figure called &quot;the Yellow King&quot;. Allusions to &quot;The King in Yellow&quot; can be observed in the show&#x27;s dark philosophy, its recurring use of &quot;Carcosa&quot; and &quot;The Yellow King&quot; as motifs throughout the series, and its symbolic use of yellow as a thematic signature that signifies insanity and decadence.

<doc id="92495" wikidata="Q205421" url="?curid=92495" title="Zipacna">
<text>In Maya mythology, Zipacna was a son of Vucub Caquix (Seven Macaw) and Chimalmat. He and his brother, Cabrakan (Earthquake), were often considered demons. Zipacna, like his relatives, was said to be very arrogant and violent. Zipacna was characterized as a large caiman and often boasted about creating mountains.

== The Four Hundred Boys ==
The Popol Vuh tells the story that one day Zipacna was basking on the beach when he was disturbed by the Four Hundred Boys (possibly patron deities of alcohol), who were attempting to construct a hut. They had felled a large tree to use as the central supporting log, but were unable to lift it. Zipacna, being immensely strong, offered to carry the log for them, which he did. Although most translations of the Popol Vuh would seem to indicate this was done as a gesture of goodwill, it is generally agreed that Zipacna did so in a spirit of arrogance, mocking the boys for their inability to do so.

The Four Hundred Boys decided it was not good that one man had such strength, and that Zipacna should be killed. They attempted to deceive Zipacna by asking him to dig a hole for their post, intending to thrust the massive column into the hole and kill him. Zipacna realized their deceit, however, and saved himself by surreptitiously digging a side tunnel and hiding inside it when the boys dropped the post in the hole. To complete the illusion of his death, Zipacna cried out in pain, and later allowed ants to carry bits of his hair and trimmings from his nails out of the hole, satisfying the boys that he had been killed.

On the third day after their apparent success, the Four Hundred Boys finished the construction of their hut and celebrated both its completion and Zipacna&#x27;s death by preparing wine and engaging in a drunken revelry. Zipacna emerged from his hole after the boys had passed out, and with his massive strength he felled the column and caused the house to crash down upon the sleeping boys, killing the lot without a single survivor. After their death, the boys entered into the heavens as the open cluster known as the Pleiades.

== Hero twins ==
Hunahpu and Xbalanque, the two divine Hero Twins, decided to exact revenge upon Zipacna for the death of the Four Hundred Boys; they also did so in a continuation of their quest to bring down the arrogant gods. The pair devised a scheme in which an elaborate fake crab was constructed and hid it deep in a canyon. They then sought out Zipacna along the beach, where he was hunting for his usual favorite food, crabs. Zipacna was very hungry and had been unable to locate any crabs for his meal, and the pair informed him they had spotted a very large crab for the taking. They guided Zipacna to their trap, and being overcome with hunger, he was unable to see through the trick. Zipacna went in for the crab, and by means not specified by the Popol Vuh, a mountain was made to collapse or fall over on top of him, either killing him or turning him into stone.

The account of Zipacna &quot;entering&quot; in search of the crab (which is specified to be a female), in particular his going in &quot;on his back&quot; on the second try, seems to be a parody of sexual intercourse. Indeed, it has been suggested by Christian inspired interpretations of the Popol Vuh that it was Zipacna&#x27;s lust and sexual appetite, not his hunger, that drove him to his doom.

== Appearances in popular culture ==

* Zipacna appeared as a Goa&#x27;uld in the television series &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; (played by Kevin Durand). He first appeared in the season 3 episode &quot;Pretense&quot;, where he was described by Teal&#x27;c as being &quot;one of the most loyal underlords of Apophis&quot;.
* Zipacna is a Notorious Monster in the SquareEnix game &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; in Ve&#x27;Lugannon Palace. He drops an item used to spawn one of the Sky guardians, Genbu—the Black Tortoise/Black Warrior of the North.
* Zipacna is the protagonist in a storyline in the webcomic Luci Phurr&#x27;s Imps. He is going around trying to gather his other gods to bring about &quot;The End of the World&quot; foretold by the Mayan calendar.
* In the 1987 book &quot;The Haunted Mesa&quot; by Louis L&#x27;amour, the protagonist, Mike Raglan, discovers that the Anasazi, or &quot;Cliff Dwellers&quot; who once occupied the Four Corners region of the American Southwest before vanishing, had travelled through a doorway to a parallel world ruled by a being known as &quot;The Hand&quot; and the Lords of Shibalba (also spelled Xibalba). The chief antagonist among them (other than The Hand, who was never seen), was known as Zipacna. He was defeated but his ultimate fate was never known nor that of a young rebel named Hunahpu who was attempting to organize his people to fight back against Zipacna&#x27;s forces. There was some speculation, never confirmed, that Zipacna himself was The Hand.
*In &quot;The Shadow Crosser&quot;, the third entry of &quot;The Storm Runner&quot; series by J. C. Cervantes, has Zipacna, spelt as Sipacna, as a supporting character.

<text> (), roughly translated as &quot;place of fright&quot;, is the name of the underworld (in ) in Maya mythology, ruled by the Maya death gods and their helpers. In 16th-century Verapaz, the entrance to Xibalba was traditionally held to be a cave in the vicinity of Cobán, Guatemala. Cave systems in nearby Belize have also been referred to as the entrance to Xibalba. In some Maya areas, the Milky Way is viewed as the road to Xibalba.

==Inhabitants==

Xibalba is described in the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; as a court below the surface of the Earth associated with death and with twelve gods or powerful rulers known as the Lords of Xibalba. The first among the Maya death gods ruling Xibalba were Hun-Came (&quot;One Death&quot;) and Vucub-Came (&quot;Seven Death&quot;), though Hun-Came is the senior of the two.

The remaining ten Lords are often referred to as demons and are given commission and domain over various forms of human suffering: to cause sickness, starvation, fear, destitution, pain, and ultimately death. These Lords all work in pairs: Xiquiripat (&quot;Flying Scab&quot;) and Cuchumaquic (&quot;Gathered Blood&quot;), who sicken people&#x27;s blood; Ahalpuh (&quot;Pus Demon&quot;) and Ahalgana (&quot;Jaundice Demon&quot;), who cause people&#x27;s bodies to swell up; Chamiabac (&quot;Bone Staff&quot;) and Chamiaholom (&quot;Skull Staff&quot;), who turn dead bodies into skeletons; Ahalmez (&quot;Sweepings Demon&quot;) and Ahaltocob (&quot;Stabbing Demon&quot;), who hide in the unswept areas of people&#x27;s houses and stab them to death; and Xic (&quot;Wing&quot;) and Patan (&quot;Packstrap&quot;), who cause people to die coughing up blood while out walking on a road. The remaining residents of Xibalba are thought to have fallen under the dominion of one of these Lords, going about the face of the Earth to carry out their listed duties.

==Structure==
Xibalba was a large palace and a number of individual structures or locations within Xibalba are described or mentioned in the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;. Chief among these was the council place of the Lords, the five or six houses that served as the first tests of Xibalba, and the Xibalban ballcourt. Also mentioned are the homes of the Lords, gardens, and other structures indicating that Xibalba was at least a great city.

Xibalba seems to be rife with tests, trials, and traps for anyone who came into the city. Even the roads to Xibalba were filled with obstacles: first a river filled with scorpions, a river filled with blood, and then a river filled with pus. Beyond these was a crossroads where travellers had to choose from among four roads that spoke in an attempt to confuse and beguile. Upon passing these obstacles, one would come upon the Xibalba council place, where it was expected visitors would greet the seated Lords. Realistic mannequins were seated near the Lords to confuse and humiliate people who greeted them, and the confused would then be invited to sit upon a bench, which was actually a hot cooking surface. The Lords of Xibalba would entertain themselves by humiliating people in this fashion before sending them into one of Xibalba&#x27;s deadly tests.

The city was home to at least six deadly houses filled with trials for visitors. The first was Dark House, a house that was completely dark inside. The second was Rattling House or Cold House, full of bone-chilling cold and rattling hail. The third was Jaguar House, filled with hungry jaguars. The fourth was Bat House, filled with dangerous shrieking bats, and the fifth was Razor House, filled with blades and razors that moved about of their own accord. In another part of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, a sixth test, Hot House, filled with fires and heat, is identified. The purpose of these tests was to either kill or humiliate people placed into them if they could not outwit the test.

==Downfall of Xibalba==
Xibalba was home of a famous ballcourt in which the heroes of the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot; succumbed to the trickery of the demons in the form of a deadly, bladed ball, as well as the site in which the Maya Hero Twins outwitted the gods and brought about their downfall.

According to the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, the denizens of Xibalba at one point enjoyed the worship of the people on the surface of the Earth who offered human sacrifice to the gods of death. Over the span of time covered in the &quot;Popol Vuh&quot;, the gods of Xibalba are tricked and finally humiliated into accepting lesser offerings from above by the Maya Twins, who got superpowers after they were burnt and their ashes thrown into a magical river. Anthropologist Dennis Tedlock has speculated that this version of history may be a Kʼicheʼ slander on earlier Mayan forms of worship.

The role of Xibalba and its inhabitants after their great defeat at the hands of the Hero Twins is unclear, although it seems to have continued its existence as a dark place of the underworld long after.

<text>Votan is a legendary or mythological figure mentioned in early European accounts of the Maya civilization.

==Origins of the Votan story==
The story of Votan in Mexico dates back to at least the late 17th century. It was first published in &quot;Constituciones diocesanas del obispado de Chiappa&quot; (1702) by Francisco Núñez de la Vega, Bishop of Chiapas. According to Francisco Javier Clavijero:

F. Núñez de la Vega, bishop of Chiapa, says, in the preface to his &quot;Synodal Constitutions&quot;, that in the visit which he made to his diocese towards the end of the last century [i.e. the late 1600s], he found many ancient calendars of the Chiapanese, and an old manuscript in the language of that country, made by the Indians themselves, in which it was said, according to their ancient tradition, that a certain person named &quot;Votan&quot; was present at that great building, which was made by order of his uncle, in order to mount up to heaven; that then every people was given its language, and that Votan himself was charged by God to make the division of the lands of Anahuac. The prelate adds afterwards, that there was in his time in Teopixca a great settlement of that diocese, a family of the surname of Votan, who were the reputed descendants of that ancient populator. We are not here endeavoring to give the antiquity to the populator of America on the faith of the Chiapanese, but merely to shew that the Americans conceived themselves the descendants of Noah.
In his account, Bishop Núñez de Vega also states that Votan belonged to the royal lineage of &quot;Cham&quot; (probably &quot;chan&quot; or snake) and that he established a kingdom called &quot;Na Chan&quot; (Snake House) on the Usumacinta River that eventually extended across Chiapas and Soconusco to the Pacific Coast. Additional information can be found in a 1786 publication by Antonio del Río that cites the same sources as Clavijero and speculates at length on Votan&#x27;s identity and travels to the Old World.

At a time when the origins of pre-Columbian cultures were poorly understood, these clerics associated Votan with the Biblical stories of the Tower of Babel and Noah, speculating that he had come to Mexico from the Old World. This tradition has been perpetuated by additional fantastic speculations that have been sharply critiqued by subsequent scholarship. This includes the association of Votan with Palenque by Ramon de Ordoñez y Aguilar, a priest who had lived near the site and wrote one of the earliest descriptions of the ruins in 1773. Ordoñez apparently incorporated some of the information that had been collected earlier by Bishop Núñez de la Vega into a document called the &quot;Probanza de Votan&quot;. &quot;This strange work contained some fragments from Ximénez and a confused account of Votan, culture hero of the Tzeltal people, who, according to Ordoñez, had built Palenque. Fantastic details described Votan&#x27;s four trips back to the Middle East.&quot; The Tzeltal are an ethnic group that occupies the region that includes Teopisca, Chiapas, about 113 km southeast of Palenque. In the late 17th century, two hundred Tzeltal families &quot;of Votan&#x27;s ancestry&quot; are said to have been living in Comitlan.

Assertion of a relationship between Votan and Odin is found in the work of the distinguished geographer Alexander von Humboldt, who wrote in &quot;Vues des Cordillères&quot; (1810):
We have fixed the special attention of our readers upon this Votan, or Wodan, an American who appears in the same family with the Wods or Odins of the Goths and of the people of Celtic origins. Since, according to the learned researches of Sir William Jones, Odin and Buddha are probably the same person, it is curious to see the names of &quot;Bondvar&quot;, &quot;Wodansdag&quot;, and &quot;Votan&quot; designating in India, Scandinavia, and in Mexico the day of a brief period.

In &quot;Histoire des nations civilisées du Mexique et de l&#x27;Amérique Centrale&quot; (1857), Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg claimed Votan was an ancient Phoenician &quot;legislateur&quot; who had migrated from the Middle East to the Maya area, defeated a race called the Quiname, built the city of Palenque, and established an empire called Xibalba that was postulated by Brasseur de Bourbourg to have once covered all of Mexico and part of the United States. Subsequent Mayanist scholarship has found little support for Phoenician contact with ancient Mesoamerica, and identifies Xibalba as a mythical place rather than a political entity.

==Influence on Mormonism==
Extensive analysis of the story of Votan appeared as commentary on the work of Antonio del Río by Paul Felix Cabrera in 1822. Critics of the LDS church have claimed that Cabrera&#x27;s work had a strong influence on Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, founders of the Latter Day Saint movement. Smith reported having a vision in 1823 that eventually led him to the claimed discovery of golden plates that documented a group of ancient Israelites journey to the Americas, 960 years of their descendants history and their dealings with the god of the Israelites. These plates are the origin of the Book of Mormon.

==Similarity to Wotan==
The similarity between the names Votan and Wotan has also been the source of much confusion. Chapter IV of &quot;&quot; (1882) by Ignatius L. Donnelly, titled &quot;The God Odin, Woden, or Wotan&quot;, repeats Clavijero&#x27;s reference in the context of speculation about Atlantis and (following Brasseur de Bourbourg) also suggests that Votan built Palenque. Donnelly quotes Clavijero as saying that Votan &quot;conducted seven families from Valum-Votan to this continent, and assigned lands to them&quot;, and implies that &quot;Valum-Votan&quot; may have been a reference to Atlantis. The story of Votan was further associated with the Atlantis legend by Lewis Spence in &quot;Atlantis in America&quot; (1925), who identifies Votan as &quot;a local name for Quetzalcoatl&quot; and provides a synopsis of the account by Núñez de la Vega.

==Pacal Votan==
Associations of Votan with Palenque have led New Age spiritual leader José Argüelles to identify Pacal the Great as &quot;Pacal Votan&quot; and to identify himself as an emanation of &quot;Valum Votan&quot;. However, no mention of Votan has been found in the inscriptions of Palenque despite considerable progress in the decipherment of the extensive Maya inscriptions known for the site.

==Culture hero?==

A more critical evaluation suggests that Votan was a culture hero of the Tzeltal whose story may be based on that of a ruler who lived in the vicinity of Teopisca, Chiapas during the Postclassic period. He was referred to as &quot;Lord of the Horizontal Wooden Drum&quot; and &quot;jaguar god of darkness&quot; (&quot;ak&#x27;bal&quot;), and his name was one of twenty day names in the Tzeltal calendar. Ritual objects associated with Votan were removed from a sanctuary and burned in the main square of Huehuetlán by Bishop Núñez de la Vega in 1691.

==Votan Zapata==
Votan is often described as the &quot;heart&quot; of indigenous people in Chiapas. The qualities of both culture hero and deep sentiment are expressed in the persona of Votan Zapata, a legendary manifestation of the spirit of Emiliano Zapata honored by members of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN).

<doc id="92512" wikidata="Q28350" url="?curid=92512" title="Lipoprotein">
<text>Structure of a [[chylomicron]] (the largest lipoprotein).
[[Lipoprotein|[[Apolipoprotein AI|ApoA]]]], [[Lipoprotein|[[Apolipoprotein B|ApoB]]]], [[Lipoprotein|[[Apolipoprotein C|ApoC]]]], [[Lipoprotein|[[Apolipoprotein E|ApoE]]]] are [[apolipoprotein]]s; green particles are [[phospholipid]]s; [[Lipoprotein|T]] is [[triglyceride]]; [[Lipoprotein|C]] is [[cholesterol ester]].

A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly whose primary function is to transport hydrophobic lipid (also known as fat) molecules in water, as in blood plasma or other extracellular fluids. They consist of a triglyceride and cholesterol center, surrounded by a phospholipid outer shell, with the hydrophilic portions oriented outward toward the surrounding water and lipophilic portions oriented inward toward the lipid center. A special kind of protein, called apolipoprotein, is embedded in the outer shell, both stabilising the complex and giving it a functional identity that determines its role.

Plasma lipoprotein particles are commonly divided into five main classes, based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoprotein content: HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL and chylomicrons. Subgroups of these plasma particles are primary drivers or modulators of atherosclerosis.

Many enzymes, transporters, structural proteins, antigens, adhesins, and toxins are sometimes also classified as lipoproteins, since they are formed by lipids and proteins.

==Scope==

===Transmembrane lipoproteins===
Some transmembrane proteolipids, especially those found in bacteria, are referred to as lipoproteins; they are not related to the lipoprotein particles that this article is about. Such transmembrane proteins are difficult to isolate, as they bind tightly to the lipid membrane, often require lipids to display the proper structure, and can be water-insoluble. Detergents are usually required to isolate transmembrane lipoproteins from their associated biological membranes.

===Plasma lipoprotein particles ===

Because fats are insoluble in water, they cannot be transported on their own in extracellular water, including blood plasma. Instead, they are surrounded by a hydrophilic external shell that functions as a transport vehicle. The role of lipoprotein particles is to transport fat molecules, such as triglycerides, phospholipids, and cholesterol within the extracellular water of the body to all the cells and tissues of the body. The proteins included in the external shell of these particles, called apolipoproteins, are synthesized and secreted into the extracellular water by both the small intestine and liver cells. The external shell also contains phospholipids and cholesterol.

All cells use and rely on fats and cholesterol as building blocks to create the multiple membranes that cells use both to control internal water content and internal water-soluble elements and to organize their internal structure and protein enzymatic systems. The outer shell of lipoprotein particles have the hydrophilic groups of phospholipids, cholesterol, and apolipoproteins directed outward. Such characteristics make them soluble in the salt-water-based blood pool. Triglycerides and cholesteryl esters are carried internally, shielded from the water by the outer shell. The kind of apolipoproteins contained in the outer shell determines the functional identity of the lipoprotein particles. The interaction of these apolipoproteins with enzymes in the blood, with each other, or with specific proteins on the surfaces of cells, determines whether triglycerides and cholesterol will be added to or removed from the lipoprotein transport particles.

Characterization in human plasma
== Structure ==
Lipoproteins are complex particles that have a central hydrophobic core of non-polar lipids, primarily cholesteryl esters and triglycerides. This hydrophobic core is surrounded by a hydrophilic membrane consisting of phospholipids, free cholesterol, and apolipoproteins. Plasma lipoproteins, found in blood plasma, are typically divided into five main classes based on size, lipid composition, and apolipoprotein content: HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL and chylomicrons.

== Functions ==

=== Metabolism ===
The handling of lipoprotein particles in the body is referred to as &quot;lipoprotein particle metabolism&quot;. It is divided into two pathways, exogenous and endogenous, depending in large part on whether the lipoprotein particles in question are composed chiefly of dietary (exogenous) lipids or whether they originated in the liver (endogenous), through de novo synthesis of triglycerides.

The hepatocytes are the main platform for the handling of triglycerides and cholesterol; the liver can also store certain amounts of glycogen and triglycerides. While adipocytes are the main storage cells for triglycerides, they do not produce any lipoproteins.

====Exogenous pathway====
Bile emulsifies fats contained in the chyme, then pancreatic lipase cleaves triglyceride molecules into two fatty acids and one 2-monoacylglycerol. Enterocytes readily absorb the small molecules from the chymus. Inside of the enterocytes, fatty acids and monoacylglycerides are transformed again into triglycerides. Then these lipids are assembled with apolipoprotein B-48 into &quot;nascent chylomicrons&quot;. These particles are then secreted into the lacteals in a process that depends heavily on apolipoprotein B-48. As they circulate through the lymphatic vessels, nascent chylomicrons bypass the liver circulation and are drained via the thoracic duct into the bloodstream.

In the blood stream, &quot;nascent chylomicron particles&quot; interact with HDL particles, resulting in HDL donation of apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent chylomicron. The chylomicron at this stage is then considered mature. Via apolipoprotein C-II, mature chylomicrons activate lipoprotein lipase (LPL), an enzyme on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels. LPL catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides that ultimately releases glycerol and fatty acids from the chylomicrons. Glycerol and fatty acids can then be absorbed in peripheral tissues, especially adipose and muscle, for energy and storage.

The hydrolyzed chylomicrons are now called &quot;chylomicron remnants&quot;. The chylomicron remnants continue circulating the bloodstream until they interact via apolipoprotein E with chylomicron remnant receptors, found chiefly in the liver. This interaction causes the endocytosis of the chylomicron remnants, which are subsequently hydrolyzed within lysosomes. Lysosomal hydrolysis releases glycerol and fatty acids into the cell, which can be used for energy or stored for later use.

====Endogenous pathway====
The liver is the central platform for the handling of lipids: it is able to store glycerols and fats in its cells, the hepatocytes. Hepatocytes are also able to create triglycerides via de novo synthesis. They also produce the bile from cholesterol. The intestines are responsible for absorbing cholesterol. They transfer it over into the blood stream.

In the hepatocytes, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters are assembled with apolipoprotein B-100 to form &quot;nascent VLDL particles&quot;. Nascent VLDL particles are released into the bloodstream via a process that depends upon apolipoprotein B-100.

In the blood stream, &quot;nascent VLDL particles&quot; bump with HDL particles; as a result, HDL particles donate apolipoprotein C-II and apolipoprotein E to the nascent VLDL particle. Once loaded with apolipoproteins C-II and E, the nascent VLDL particle is considered mature. VLDL particles circulate and encounter LPL expressed on endothelial cells. Apolipoprotein C-II activates LPL, causing hydrolysis of the VLDL particle and the release of glycerol and fatty acids. These products can be absorbed from the blood by peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle. The hydrolyzed VLDL particles are now called VLDL remnants or intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs). VLDL remnants can circulate and, via an interaction between apolipoprotein E and the remnant receptor, be absorbed by the liver, or they can be further hydrolyzed by hepatic lipase.

Hydrolysis by hepatic lipase releases glycerol and fatty acids, leaving behind &quot;IDL remnants&quot;, called low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which contain a relatively high cholesterol content (). LDL circulates and is absorbed by the liver and peripheral cells. Binding of LDL to its target tissue occurs through an interaction between the LDL receptor and apolipoprotein B-100 on the LDL particle. Absorption occurs through endocytosis, and the internalized LDL particles are hydrolyzed within lysosomes, releasing lipids, chiefly cholesterol.

=== Possible role in oxygen transport ===
Plasma lipoproteins may carry oxygen gas. This property is due to the crystalline hydrophobic structure of lipids, providing a suitable environment for O2 solubility compared to an aqueous medium.

=== Role in inflammation ===
Inflammation, a biological system response to stimuli such as the introduction of a pathogen, has an underlying role in numerous systemic biological functions and pathologies. This is a useful response by the immune system when the body is exposed to pathogens, such as bacteria in locations that will prove harmful, but can also have detrimental effects if left unregulated. It has been demonstrated that lipoproteins, specifically HDL, have important roles in the inflammatory process.

When the body is functioning under normal, stable physiological conditions, HDL has been shown to be beneficial in several ways. LDL contains apolipoprotein B (apoB), which allows LDL to bind to different tissues, such as the artery wall if the glycocalyx has been damaged by high blood sugar levels. If oxidised, the LDL can become trapped in the proteoglycans, preventing its removal by HDL cholesterol efflux. Normal functioning HDL is able to prevent the process of oxidation of LDL and the subsequent inflammatory processes seen after oxidation.

Lipopolysaccharide, or LPS, is the major pathogenic factor on the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive bacteria has a similar component named Lipoteichoic acid, or LTA. HDL has the ability to bind LPS and LTA, creating HDL-LPS complexes to neutralize the harmful effects in the body and clear the LPS from the body. HDL also has significant roles interacting with cells of the immune system to modulate the availability of cholesterol and modulate the immune response.

Under certain abnormal physiological conditions such as system infection or sepsis, the major components of HDL become altered, The composition and quantity of lipids and apolipoproteins are altered as compared to normal physiological conditions, such as a decrease in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), phospholipids, apoA-I (a major lipoprotein in HDL that has been shown to have beneficial anti-inflammatory properties), and an increase in Serum amyloid A. This altered composition of HDL is commonly referred to as acute-phase HDL in an acute-phase inflammatory response, during which time HDL can lose its ability to inhibit the oxidation of LDL. In fact, this altered composition of HDL is associated with increased mortality and worse clinical outcomes in patients with sepsis.

==Classification==

===By density===
Lipoproteins may be classified as five major groups, listed from larger and lower density to smaller and higher density. Lipoproteins are larger and less dense when the fat to protein ratio is increased. They are classified on the basis of electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy via the Vantera Analyzer.
* Chylomicrons carry triglycerides (fat) from the intestines to the liver, to skeletal muscle, and to adipose tissue.
* Very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) carry (newly synthesised) triglycerides from the liver to adipose tissue.
* Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) are intermediate between VLDL and LDL. They are not usually detectable in the blood when fasting.
* Low-density lipoproteins (LDL) carry 3,000 to 6,000 fat molecules (phospholipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, etc.) around the body. LDL particles are sometimes referred to as &quot;bad&quot; lipoprotein because concentrations of two kinds of LDL (sd-LDL and LPA), correlate with atherosclerosis progression. In healthy individuals, most LDL is large and buoyant (lb LDL).
** large buoyant LDL (lb LDL) particles
** small dense LDL (sd LDL) particles
** Lipoprotein(a) (LPA) is a lipoprotein particle of a certain phenotype
* High-density lipoproteins (HDL) collect fat molecules from the body&#x27;s cells/tissues and take them back to the liver. HDLs are sometimes referred to as &quot;good&quot; lipoprotein because higher concentrations correlate with low rates of atherosclerosis progression and/or regression.

For young healthy research subjects, ~70 kg (154 lb), these data represent averages across individuals studied, percentages represent % dry weight:
 However, these data are not necessarily reliable for any one individual or for the general clinical population.

===Alpha and beta===
It is also possible to classify lipoproteins as &quot;alpha&quot; and &quot;beta&quot;, according to the classification of proteins in serum protein electrophoresis. This terminology is sometimes used in describing lipid disorders such as abetalipoproteinemia.

===Subdivisions===
Lipoproteins, such as LDL and HDL, can be further subdivided into subspecies isolated through a variety of methods. These are subdivided by density or by the protein contents/ proteins they carry. While the research is currently ongoing, researchers are learning that different subspecies contain different apolipoproteins, proteins, and lipid contents between species which have different physiological roles. For example, within the HDL lipoprotein subspecies, a large number of proteins are involved in general lipid metabolism. However, it is being elucidated that HDL subspecies also contain proteins involved in the following functions: homeostasis, fibrinogen, clotting cascade, inflammatory and immune responses, including the complement system, proteolysis inhibitors, acute-phase response proteins, and the LPS-binding protein, heme and iron metabolism, platelet regulation, vitamin binding and general transport.

==Research ==
High levels of lipoprotein(a) are a significant risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases via mechanisms associated with inflammation and thrombosis. The links of mechanisms between different lipoprotein isoforms and risk for cardiovascular diseases, lipoprotein synthesis, regulation, and metabolism, and related risks for genetic diseases are under active research, as of 2022.

<text>A detergent is a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleansing properties when in dilute solutions. There are a large variety of detergents. A common family is the alkylbenzene sulfonates, which are soap-like compounds that are more soluble than soap in hard water, because the polar sulfonate is less likely than the polar carboxylate of soap to bind to calcium and other ions found in hard water.

==Definitions==
The word &quot;detergent&quot; is derived from the Latin adjective &quot;detergens&quot;, from the verb &quot;detergere&quot;, meaning to wipe or polish off. Detergent can be defined as a surfactant or a mixture of surfactants with cleansing properties when in dilute solutions. However, conventionally, detergent is used to mean synthetic cleaning compounds as opposed to &quot;soap&quot; (a salt of the natural fatty acid), even though soap is also a detergent in the true sense. In domestic contexts, the term &quot;detergent&quot; refers to household cleaning products such as &quot;laundry detergent&quot; or &quot;dish detergent&quot;, which are in fact complex mixtures of different compounds, not all of which are by themselves detergents.

Detergency is the ability to remove unwanted substances termed &#x27;soils&#x27; from a substrate (e.g., clothing).

==Structure and properties==
Detergents are a group of compounds with an amphiphilic structure, where each molecule has a hydrophilic (polar) head and a long hydrophobic (non-polar) tail. The hydrophobic portion of these molecules may be straight- or branched-chain hydrocarbons, or it may have a steroid structure. The hydrophilic portion is more varied, they may be ionic or non-ionic, and can range from a simple or a relatively elaborate structure. Detergents are surfactants since they can decrease the surface tension of water. Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds (like oil and grease) with water. Because air is not hydrophilic, detergents are also foaming agents to varying degrees.

Detergent molecules aggregate to form micelles, which makes them soluble in water. The hydrophobic group of the detergent is the main driving force of micelle formation, its aggregation forms the hydrophobic core of the micelles. The micelle can remove grease, protein or soiling particles. The concentration at which micelles start to form is the critical micelle concentration (CMC), and the temperature at which the micelles further aggregate to separate the solution into two phases is the cloud point when the solution becomes cloudy and detergency is optimal.

Detergents work better in an alkaline pH. The properties of detergents are dependent on the molecular structure of the monomer. The ability to foam may be determined by the head group, for example anionic surfactants are high-foaming, while nonionic surfactants may be non-foaming or low-foaming.

==Chemical classifications of detergents==
Detergents are classified into four broad groupings, depending on the electrical charge of the surfactants.

===Anionic detergents===
Typical anionic detergents are alkylbenzene sulfonates. The alkylbenzene portion of these anions is lipophilic and the sulfonate is hydrophilic. Two varieties have been popularized, those with branched alkyl groups and those with linear alkyl groups. The former were largely phased out in economically advanced societies because they are poorly biodegradable.

Anionic detergents are the most common form of detergents, and an estimated 6 billion kilograms of anionic detergents are produced annually for the domestic markets.

Bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DOC), are anionic detergents produced by the liver to aid in digestion and absorption of fats and oils.

===Cationic detergents===
Cationic detergents are similar to anionic ones, but quaternary ammonium replaces the hydrophilic anionic sulfonate group. The ammonium sulfate center is positively charged. Cationic surfactants generally have poor detergency.

===Non-ionic detergents===
Non-ionic detergents are characterized by their uncharged, hydrophilic headgroups. Typical non-ionic detergents are based on polyoxyethylene or a glycoside. Common examples of the former include Tween, Triton, and the Brij series. These materials are also known as ethoxylates or PEGylates and their metabolites, nonylphenol. Glycosides have a sugar as their uncharged hydrophilic headgroup. Examples include octyl thioglucoside and maltosides. HEGA and MEGA series detergents are similar, possessing a sugar alcohol as headgroup.

===Amphoteric detergents===
Amphoteric or zwitterionic detergents have zwitterions within a particular pH range, and possess a net zero charge arising from the presence of equal numbers of +1 and −1 charged chemical groups. Examples include CHAPS.

==History==
Soap is known to have been used as a surfactant for washing clothes since the Sumerian time in 2,500 B.C. In ancient Egypt, soda was used as a wash additive. In the 19th century, synthetic surfactants began to be created, for example from olive oil. Sodium silicate (water glass) was used in soap-making in the United States in the 1860s, and in 1876, Henkel sold a sodium silicate-based product that can be used with soap and marketed as a &quot;universal detergent&quot; (&quot;Universalwaschmittel&quot;) in Germany. Soda was then mixed with sodium silicate to produce Germany&#x27;s first brand name detergent Bleichsoda. In 1907, Henkel also added a bleaching agent sodium perborate to launch the first &#x27;self-acting&#x27; laundry detergent Persil to eliminate the laborious rubbing of laundry by hand.

During the First World War, there was a shortage of oils and fats needed to make soap. In order to find alternatives for soap, synthetic detergents were made in Germany by chemists using raw material derived from coal tar. These early products, however, did not provide sufficient detergency. In 1928, effective detergent was made through the sulfation of fatty alcohol, but large-scale production was not feasible until low-cost fatty alcohols become available in the early 1930s. The synthetic detergent created was more effective and less likely to form scum than soap in hard water, and can also eliminate acid and alkaline reactions and decompose dirt. Commercial detergent products with fatty alcohol sulphates began to be sold, initially in 1932 in Germany by Henkel. In the United States, detergents were sold in 1933 by Procter &amp; Gamble (Dreft) primarily in areas with hard water. However, sales in the US grew slowly until the introduction of &#x27;built&#x27; detergents with the addition of effective phosphate builder developed in the early 1940s. The builder improves the performance of the surfactants by softening the water through the chelation of calcium and magnesium ions, helping to maintain an alkaline pH, as well as dispersing and keeping the soiling particles in solution. The development of the petrochemical industry after the Second World War also yielded material for the production of a range of synthetic surfactants, and alkylbenzene sulfonates became the most important detergent surfactants used. By the 1950s, laundry detergents had become widespread, and largely replaced soap for cleaning clothes in developed countries.

Over the years, many types of detergents have been developed for a variety of purposes, for example, low-sudsing detergents for use in front-loading washing machines, heavy-duty detergents effective in removing grease and dirt, all-purpose detergents and specialty detergents. They become incorporated in various products outside of laundry use, for example in dishwasher detergents, shampoo, toothpaste, industrial cleaners, and in lubricants and fuels to reduce or prevent the formation of sludge or deposits. The formulation of detergent products may include bleach, fragrances, dyes and other additives. The use of phosphates in detergent, however, led to concerns over nutrient pollution and demand for changes to the formulation of the detergents. Concerns were also raised over the use of surfactants such as branched alkylbenzene sulfonate (tetrapropylenebenzene sulfonate) that lingers in the environment, which led to their replacement by surfactants that are more biodegradable, such as linear alkylbenzene sulfonate. Developments over the years have included the use of enzymes, substitutes for phosphates such as zeolite A and NTA, TAED as bleach activator, sugar-based surfactants which are biodegradable and milder to skin, and other green friendly products, as well as changes to the form of delivery such as tablets, gels and pods.

==Major applications of detergents==
===Household cleaning===
One of the largest applications of detergents is for household and shop cleaning including dish washing and washing laundry. These detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions, and the formulations of these detergents are often complex mixtures of a variety of chemicals aside from surfactants, reflecting the diverse demands of the application and the highly competitive consumer market. These detergents may contain the following components:
* surfactants
* foam regulators
* builders
* bleach
* bleach activators
* enzymes
* dyes
* fragrances
* other additives

===Fuel additives===
Both carburetors and fuel injector components of internal combustion engines benefit from detergents in the fuels to prevent fouling. Concentrations are about 300 ppm. Typical detergents are long-chain amines and amides such as polyisobuteneamine and polyisobuteneamide/succinimide.

===Biological reagent===
Reagent grade detergents are employed for the isolation and purification of integral membrane proteins found in biological cells. Solubilization of cell membrane bilayers requires a detergent that can enter the inner membrane monolayer. Advancements in the purity and sophistication of detergents have facilitated structural and biophysical characterization of important membrane proteins such as ion channels also the disrupt membrane by binding lipopolysaccharide, transporters, signaling receptors, and photosystem II.

<text>The , colloquially known in English as the bullet train, is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan. It was initially built to connect distant Japanese regions with Tokyo, the capital, to aid economic growth and development. Beyond long-distance travel, some sections around the largest metropolitan areas are used as a commuter rail network. It is owned by the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency and operated by five Japan Railways Group companies.

Starting with the Tokaido Shinkansen () in 1964, the network has expanded to consist of of lines with maximum speeds of , of Mini-shinkansen lines with a maximum speed of , and of spur lines with Shinkansen services. The network links most major cities on the islands of Honshu and Kyushu, and connects to Hakodate on the northern island of Hokkaido. An extension to Sapporo is under construction and scheduled to open in 2038. The maximum operating speed is (on a section of the Tōhoku Shinkansen). Test runs have reached for conventional rail in 1996, and up to a world record for SCMaglev trains in April 2015.

The original Tokaido Shinkansen, connecting Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka, three of Japan&#x27;s largest cities, is one of the world&#x27;s busiest high-speed rail lines. In the one-year period preceding March 2017, it carried 159 million passengers, and since its opening more than six decades ago, it has transported more than 6.4 billion total passengers. At peak times, the line carries up to 16 trains per hour in each direction with 16 cars each (1,323-seat capacity and occasionally additional standing passengers) with a minimum headway of three minutes between trains.

The Shinkansen network of Japan had the highest annual passenger ridership (a maximum of 353 million in 2007) of any high-speed rail network until 2011, when the Chinese high-speed railway network surpassed it at 370 million passengers annually.

== Etymology ==
 in Japanese means &#x27;new trunk line&#x27; or &#x27;new main line&#x27;, but this word is used to describe both the railway lines the trains run on and the trains themselves. In English, the trains are also known as the bullet train. The term originates from 1939, and was the initial name given to the Shinkansen project in its earliest planning stages. Furthermore, the name , used exclusively until 1972 for trains on the Tōkaidō Shinkansen, is used today in English-language announcements and signage.

== History ==
Japan was the first country to build dedicated railway lines for high-speed travel. Because of the mountainous terrain, the existing network consisted of narrow-gauge lines, which generally took indirect routes and could not be adapted to higher speeds due to technical limitations of narrow-gauge rail. For example, if a standard-gauge rail has a curve with a maximum speed of , the same curve on narrow-gauge rail will have a maximum allowable speed of . Consequently, Japan had a greater need for new high-speed lines than countries where the existing standard-gauge or broad-gauge rail system had more upgrade potential.

Among the key people credited with the construction of the first Shinkansen are Hideo Shima, the Chief Engineer, and Shinji Sogō, the first President of Japanese National Railways (JNR) who managed to persuade politicians to back the plan. Other significant people responsible for its technical development were Tadanao Miki, Tadashi Matsudaira, and Hajime Kawanabe based at the Railway Technical Research Institute (RTRI), part of JNR. They were responsible for much of the technical development of the first line, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen. All three had worked on aircraft design during World War II.

=== Early proposals ===

The popular English name &quot;bullet train&quot; is a literal translation of the Japanese term , a nickname given to the project while it was initially discussed in the 1930s. The name stuck because of the original 0 Series Shinkansen&#x27;s resemblance to a bullet and its high speed.

The &quot;Shinkansen&quot; name was first formally used in 1940 for a proposed standard-gauge passenger and freight line between Tokyo and Shimonoseki that would have used steam and electric locomotives with a top speed of . Over the next three years, the Ministry of Railways drew up more ambitious plans to extend the line to Beijing (through a tunnel to Korea) and even Singapore, and build connections to the Trans-Siberian Railway and other trunk lines in Asia. These plans were abandoned in 1943 as Japan&#x27;s position in World War II worsened. However, some construction did commence on the line; several tunnels on the present-day Shinkansen date to the war-era project.

=== Construction ===
Following the end of World War II, high-speed rail was forgotten for several years while traffic of passengers and freight steadily increased on the conventional Tōkaidō Main Line along with the reconstruction of Japanese industry and economy. By the mid-1950s the Tōkaidō Line was operating at full capacity, and the Ministry of Railways decided to revisit the Shinkansen project. In 1957, Odakyu Electric Railway introduced its 3000 series SE Romancecar train, setting a world speed record of for a narrow-gauge train when JNR leased a trainset in order to perform high-speed tests. This train gave designers the confidence that they could safely build an even faster standard-gauge train. Thus the first Shinkansen, the 0 series, was built on the success of the Romancecar.

In the 1950s, the Japanese national attitude was that as was happening in the United States, railways would soon be outdated and replaced by air travel and highways. However, Shinji Sogō, President of Japanese National Railways, insisted strongly on the possibility of high-speed rail, and the Shinkansen project was implemented.

Government approval came in December 1958, and construction of the first segment of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka started in April 1959. The cost of constructing the Shinkansen was at first estimated at nearly 200 billion yen, which was raised in the form of a government loan, railway bonds and a low-interest loan of US$80 million from the World Bank. Initial estimates, however, were understated and the actual cost was about 380 billion yen. As the budget shortfall became clear in 1963, Sogo resigned to take responsibility.

A test facility for rolling stock, called the Kamonomiya Model Section, opened in Odawara in 1962.

=== Initial success ===

The Tōkaidō Shinkansen began service on 1 October 1964, in time for the first Tokyo Olympics. The conventional Limited Express service took six hours and 40 minutes from Tokyo to Osaka, but the Shinkansen made the trip in just four hours, shortened to three hours and ten minutes by 1965. It enabled day trips between Tokyo and Osaka, the two largest metropolises in Japan, significantly changed the style of business and life of the Japanese people, and increased new traffic demand. The service was an immediate success, reaching the 100 million passenger mark in less than three years on 13 July 1967, and one billion passengers in 1976. Sixteen-car trains were introduced for Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka. With an average of 23,000 passengers per hour in each direction in 1992, the Tōkaidō Shinkansen was the world&#x27;s busiest high-speed rail line. As of 2014, the train&#x27;s 50th anniversary, daily passenger traffic rose to 391,000 which, spread over its 18-hour schedule, represented an average of just under 22,000 passengers per hour.

The first Shinkansen trains, the 0 series, ran at speeds of up to , later increased to . The last of these trains, with their classic bullet-nosed appearance, were retired on 30 November 2008. A driving car from one of the 0 series trains was donated by JR West to the National Railway Museum in York, United Kingdom in 2001.

=== Network expansion ===
The Tōkaidō Shinkansen&#x27;s rapid success prompted an extension westward to Okayama, Hiroshima and Fukuoka (the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen), which was completed in 1975. Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was an ardent supporter of the Shinkansen, and his government proposed an extensive network paralleling most existing trunk lines. Two new lines, the Tōhoku Shinkansen and Jōetsu Shinkansen, were built following this plan. Many other planned lines were delayed or scrapped entirely as JNR slid into debt throughout the late 1970s, largely because of the high cost of building the Shinkansen network. By the early 1980s, the company was practically insolvent, leading to its privatization in 1987.

Development of the Shinkansen by the privatised regional JR companies has continued, with new train models developed, each generally with its own distinctive appearance (such as the 500 series introduced by JR West). Since 2014, Shinkansen trains run regularly at speeds up to on the Tōhoku Shinkansen; only the Shanghai maglev train, China Railway High-speed networks, and the Indonesian Jakarta-Bandung High-speed railway have commercial services that operate faster.

Since 1970, development has also been underway for the Chūō Shinkansen, a planned maglev line from Tokyo to Osaka. On 21 April 2015, a seven-car L0 series maglev trainset, planned to be used on the line, set a world speed record of . The line is expected to operate at , with the estimated travel time between Tokyo and Osaka taking 67 minutes. Construction commenced in 2011 and was originally scheduled to open in 2027, though it has since been delayed to at least 2034.

== Technology ==
To enable high-speed operation, Shinkansen uses a range of advanced technology compared with conventional rail, achieving not only high speed but also a high standard of safety and comfort. Its success has influenced other railways in the world, demonstrating the importance and advantages of high-speed rail.

=== Routing ===
The majority of Shinkansen routes never intersect with slower, narrow-gauge conventional lines. Consequently, the Shinkansen is not affected by slower trains and has the capacity to operate many high-speed trains punctually. Routes are also completely grade separated from road traffic and tracks are strictly off-limits, with penalties against trespassing regulated by law. The routes make extensive use of tunnels and viaducts to go through and over obstacles rather than around them, with a minimum curve radius of , although the older Tōkaidō Shinkansen line has a minimum of . 

While most Shinkansen routes follow this pattern, two exceptions exist. They are the mini-shinkansen lines, which run on conventional lines converted to standard gauge; and the Hokkaido Shinkansen, which shares trackage with narrow-gauge freight trains through the Seikan Tunnel.

=== Track ===

The Shinkansen uses standard gauge in contrast to the narrow gauge of most other lines in Japan. Continuous welded rail and swingnose crossing points are employed, eliminating gaps at turnouts and crossings. Long rails are used, joined by expansion joints to minimize gauge fluctuation due to thermal elongation and shrinkage.

A combination of ballasted and slab track is used, with slab track exclusively employed on concrete bed sections such as viaducts and tunnels. Slab track is significantly more cost-effective in tunnel sections, since the lower track height reduces the cross-sectional area of the tunnel, reducing construction costs up to 30%.
However, the smaller diameter of Shinkansen tunnels, compared to some other high-speed lines, has resulted in the issue of tunnel boom becoming a concern for residents living close to tunnel portals.

The slab track consists of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular upstands, measuring in diameter and high, are located at 5-metre intervals. The prefabricated upstands are made of either reinforced concrete or pre-stressed reinforced concrete; they prevent the track slab from moving latitudinally or longitudinally. One track slab weighs approximately 5 tons and is wide, long and thick.

=== Signal system ===
The Shinkansen employs an ATC (automatic train control) system, eliminating the need for trackside signals. It uses a comprehensive system of automatic train protection. Centralized traffic control manages all train operations, and all tasks relating to train movement, track, station and schedule are networked and computerized.

=== Electrical systems ===
Shinkansen uses a 25 kV AC overhead power supply (20 kV AC on Mini-shinkansen lines), to overcome the limitations of the 1,500 V direct current used on the existing electrified narrow-gauge system. Power is distributed along the train&#x27;s axles to reduce the heavy axle loads under single power cars. The AC frequency of the power supply for the Tokaido Shinkansen is 60 Hz.

=== Trains ===

Shinkansen trains are electric multiple units (EMUs), offering fast acceleration, deceleration and reduced damage to the track because of the use of lighter vehicles compared to locomotives or power cars. The coaches are air-sealed to ensure stable air pressure when entering tunnels at high speed.

Shinkansen trains (excluding mini-Shinkansen) are also built to a larger loading gauge compared to conventional-speed rolling stock. This larger loading gauge permits wider coaches, allowing for 5-abreast seating (2+3) in Standard Class coaches, compared to the more common 4-abreast (2+2) seating usually found elsewhere. On occasions, this wider loading gauge was also used to allow 6-abreast seating (3+3) on certain trains, such as the E1 and E4 series sets. This, combined with a lack of power cars, allows for a higher passenger capacity within a shorter train length. However, since mini-Shinkansen lines are effectively track-regauged conventional lines, the conventional loading gauge for 1,067mm lines still applies on mini-Shinkansen lines. 

=== Traction ===
The Shinkansen has used EMUs from the outset, with the 0 Series Shinkansen having all axles powered. Other railway manufacturers were traditionally reluctant or unable to use distributed traction configurations (Talgo, the German ICE 2 and the French (and subsequently South Korean) TGV (and KTX-I and KTX-Sancheon) use the locomotive (also known as power car) configuration with the Renfe Class 102 and continues with it for the Talgo AVRIL because it is not possible to use powered bogies as part of Talgo&#x27;s bogie design, which uses a modified Jacobs bogie with a single axle instead of two and allows the wheels to rotate independently of each other, on the ICE 2, TGV and KTX it is because it easily allows for a high ride quality and less electrical equipment.) In Japan, significant engineering desirability exists for the electric multiple unit configuration. A greater proportion of motored axles permits higher acceleration, so the Shinkansen does not lose as much time if stopping frequently. Shinkansen lines have more stops in proportion to their lengths than high-speed lines elsewhere in the world.

==Lines ==

The main Shinkansen lines are:
In practice, the Tokaido, San&#x27;yō, and Kyushu lines form a contiguous west/southbound line from Tokyo, as train services run between the Tokaido and San&#x27;yō lines and between the San&#x27;yō and Kyushu lines, though the lines are operated by different companies.

The Tokaido Shinkansen tracks are not physically connected to the lines of the Tohoku Shinkansen at Tokyo Station, as they use different electrification standards, signaling systems, and earthquake mitigation devices. There also exists a dispute between JR East and JR Central about the use of the two platforms which were added to the Tokaido line&#x27;s half of Tokyo station. Before JNR&#x27;s privatization, they were conceived as being shared with the Tohoku line, and their construction used funds allocated to the Tohoku line&#x27;s extension to Tokyo; however, the extension was finished after privatization, by which time the platforms were owned by JR Central. Therefore, there is no through service between those lines. All northbound services from Tokyo travel along the Tohoku Shinkansen until at least Ōmiya before splitting off towards Sendai or Takasaki.

Two further lines, known as &quot;Mini-shinkansen&quot;, have also been constructed by re-gauging and upgrading existing sections of line:

There are two standard-gauge lines not technically classified as Shinkansen lines but run Shinkansen trains as they use tracks leading to Shinkansen storage/maintenance yards:
* Hakata Minami Line (Hakata – Hakataminami)
* Gala-Yuzawa Line – technically a branch of the Jōetsu Line – (Echigo-Yuzawa – Gala-Yuzawa)

=== Lines under construction ===
The following lines are under construction. These lines except Chūō Shinkansen, called or &quot;planned Shinkansen&quot;, are the Shinkansen projects designated in the decided by the government.

* Hokkaido Shinkansen from to is under construction and scheduled to open by 2038.
* Chūō Shinkansen (Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka) is the first maglev Shinkansen line, which has been under construction since 2014. JR Central originally aimed to begin commercial service between Tokyo and Nagoya in 2027. However, in 2024, Central Japan Railway Co President Shunsuke Niwa said that due to construction delays a 2027 opening was now impossible and it is not expected to open until at least 2034.

=== Planned lines ===

* The extension of Hokuriku Shinkansen to Osaka is proposed, with the route via Obama and Kyoto selected by the government on 20 December 2016. Construction is proposed to commence in 2030, and take 15 years.
* Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen has been built to full Shinkansen standards between Takeo-Onsen and Nagasaki, with the existing narrow-gauge line from Shin-Tosu to Takeo Onsen to remain as narrow-gauge track, although there is a proposal to build the section between Shin-Tosu and Takeo Onsen to full Shinkansen standards. In 2018, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism released cost-benefit analysis results to compare and contrast full Shinkansen, Mini-shinkansen, and Gauge Change Train for this section.
=== Cancelled lines ===

The Narita Shinkansen project to connect Tokyo to Narita International Airport, initiated in the 1970s but halted in 1983 after landowner protests, has been officially cancelled and removed from the Basic Plan governing Shinkansen construction. Parts of its planned right-of-way were used by the Narita Sky Access Line which opened in 2010, and the Keiyo Line reused space originally set aside for the Narita Shinkansen terminus at Tokyo Station. Although the Sky Access Line uses standard-gauge track, it was not built to Shinkansen specifications and there are no plans to convert it into a full Shinkansen line.

=== Proposed lines ===

Many Shinkansen lines were proposed during the boom of the early 1970s but have yet to be constructed and have subsequently been shelved indefinitely.
* Hokkaido Shinkansen northward extension: Sapporo–Asahikawa
* : Oshamanbe–Muroran–Sapporo
* : Toyama–Niigata–Aomori
** Toyama–Jōetsu-Myōkō exists as part of the Hokuriku Shinkansen, and Nagaoka–Niigata exists as part of the Jōetsu Shinkansen, with provisions for the Uetsu Shinkansen at Nagaoka.
* : Fukushima–Yamagata–Akita
** Fukushima–Shinjō and Ōmagari–Akita exist as the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen, respectively, but as &quot;Mini-Shinkansen&quot; upgrades of existing track, they do not meet the requirements of the Basic Plan.
* : Nagoya–Tsuruga
* : Osaka–Tottori–Matsue–Shimonoseki
* : Okayama–Matsue
* : Osaka–Tokushima–Takamatsu–Matsuyama–Ōita
* : Okayama–Kōchi–Matsuyama
** There have been some activity regarding the Shikoku and Trans-Shikoku Shinkansen in recent years. In 2016, the Shikoku and Trans-Shikoku Shinkansen were identified as potential future projects in a review of long-term plans for the Shikoku area and funds allocated towards the planning of the route. A profitability study has also been commissioned by the city of Oita in 2018 that found the route to be potentially profitable
* : Fukuoka–Ōita–Miyazaki–Kagoshima
* : Ōita–Kumamoto

In addition, the Basic Plan specified that the Jōetsu Shinkansen should start from Shinjuku, not Tokyo Station, which would have required building an additional of track between Shinjuku and Ōmiya. While no construction work was ever started, land along the proposed track, including an underground section leading to Shinjuku Station, remains reserved. If capacity on the Tokyo–Ōmiya section proves insufficient at some point, construction of the Shinjuku–Ōmiya link may be reconsidered.

In December 2009, then transport minister Seiji Maehara proposed a bullet train link to Haneda Airport, using an existing spur that connects the Tōkaidō Shinkansen to a train depot. JR Central called the plan &quot;unrealistic&quot; due to tight train schedules on the existing line, but reports said that Maehara wished to continue discussions on the idea. The succeeding minister has not indicated whether this proposal remains supported. While the plan may become more feasible after the opening the Chūō Shinkansen (sometimes referred to as a bypass to the Tokaido Shinkansen) frees up capacity, construction is already underway for other rail improvements between Haneda and Tokyo station expected to be completed prior to the opening of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, so any potential Shinkansen service would likely offer only marginal benefit. Despite these plans ultimately not being realized (owing in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic), rail projects in the vicinity of Haneda Airport, including the Haneda Airport Access Line and the Tokyo Rinkai Subway Line, continue to undergo planning.

== Services ==

Originally intended to carry passenger trains by day and freight trains by night, the Shinkansen lines carried exclusively passengers for the first five and a half decades of their operation. Light freight has been carried on some passenger services since 2019, and there are plans to expand this with freight-only trains in the future.

The system shuts down between midnight and 06:00 every day for maintenance. Japan&#x27;s few remaining overnight passenger trains run on the older, narrow-gauge network that the Shinkansen parallels.

There are three principal service types on the Shinkansen:

* Express services – these stop at only the very largest stations and, as a result, are the fastest Shinkansen services measured by average speed.
* Semi-express services – these stop at certain smaller stops alongside stopping at all the largest stations. These allow for faster connections from smaller stops to larger stations than would be otherwise possible with a local service.
* Local services – these stop at every station along the Shinkansen line. Consequently, local services are the slowest Shinkansen services measured by average speed. Frequently, these services only operate on a part of the line, instead of covering the entirety.

== Train types ==
Trains are up to sixteen cars long. With each car measuring in length, the longest trains are 400 m ( mile) end to end. Stations are similarly long to accommodate these trains. Some of Japan&#x27;s high-speed maglev trains are considered Shinkansen, while other slower maglev trains (such as Linimo, serving local communities in and nearby Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture) are intended as alternatives to conventional urban rapid transit systems.

== Reliability ==

=== Punctuality ===
The Shinkansen is very reliable thanks to several factors, including its near-total separation from slower traffic. There are separate laws governing interfering with or otherwise obstructing Shinkansen trains, tracks, or its operation. In 2016, JR Central reported that the Shinkansen&#x27;s average delay from schedule per train was 24 seconds. This includes delays due to uncontrollable causes, such as natural disasters.

=== Safety record ===
Over the Shinkansen&#x27;s 60-plus year history, carrying over 10 billion passengers, there have been no passenger fatalities due to train accidents such as derailments or collisions, despite frequent earthquakes and typhoons. Injuries and a single fatality have been caused by doors closing on passengers or their belongings; attendants are employed at platforms to prevent such accidents. There have, however, been suicides by passengers jumping both from and in front of moving trains. On 30 June 2015, a passenger committed suicide on board a Shinkansen train by setting himself on fire, killing another passenger and seriously injuring seven other people.

There have been two derailments of Shinkansen trains in passenger service. The first one occurred during the Chūetsu earthquake on 23 October 2004. Eight of ten cars of the &quot;Toki&quot; No. 325 train on the Jōetsu Shinkansen derailed near Nagaoka Station in Nagaoka, Niigata. There were no casualties among the 154 passengers.

Another derailment happened on 2 March 2013 on the Akita Shinkansen when the &quot;Komachi&quot; No. 25 train derailed in blizzard conditions in Daisen, Akita. No passengers were injured.

In the event of an earthquake, an earthquake detection system can bring the train to a stop very quickly; newer trainsets are lighter and have stronger braking systems, allowing for quicker stopping. New anti-derailment devices were installed on tracks after analysis of the Jōetsu derailment.

Several months after the exposure of the Kobe Steel falsification scandal, which is among the suppliers of high-strength steel for Shinkansen trainsets, cracks were found upon inspection of a single bogie, and removed from service on 11 December 2017.

On 23 January 2024, a massive power outage struck the Tohoku, Hokuriku and Joetsu Shinkansen lines, resulting in the cancellation of 283 trains and affecting about 120,000 passengers. JR East said that the outage was caused by a Kagayaki service train touching an overhead power cable which was left dangling after the metal rod supporting it fractured between Omiya Station in Saitama and Ueno Station in Tokyo. The incident damaged the train&#x27;s pantographs and a window, while two railway employees were hospitalized following an explosion that occurred at the site during repairs. Most Shinkansen services were restored the following morning.

== Effects ==
=== Economics ===
The Shinkansen has had a significant beneficial effect on Japan&#x27;s business, economy, society, environment and culture beyond mere construction and operational contributions. The resultant time savings alone from switching from a conventional to a high-speed network have been estimated at 400 million hours, and the system has an economic contribution of per year. That does not include the savings from reduced reliance on imported fuel, which also has national security benefits. Shinkansen lines, particularly in the very crowded coastal Taiheiyō Belt megalopolis, met two primary goals:

* Shinkansen trains reduced the congestion burden on regional transportation by increasing throughput on a minimal land footprint, therefore being economically preferable compared to modes (such as airports or highways) common in less densely populated regions of the world. 
* As rail was already the primary urban mode of passenger travel, from that perspective it was akin to a sunk cost; there was not a significant number of motorists to convince to switch modes. The initial megalopolitan Shinkansen lines were profitable and paid for themselves. Connectivity rejuvenated rural towns such as Kakegawa that would otherwise be too distant from major cities.

However, upon the introduction of the 1973 Basic Plan the initial prudence in developing Shinkansen lines gave way to political considerations to extend the mode to far less populated regions of the country, partly to spread these benefits beyond the key centres of Kanto and Kinki. Although in some cases regional extension was frustrated by protracted land acquisition (sometimes influenced by the cancellation of the Narita Shinkansen following fierce protests by locals), over time Shinkansen lines were built to relatively sparsely populated areas with the intent to disperse the population away from the capital.

Such expansion had a significant cost. JNR, the national railway company, was already burdened with subsidizing unprofitable rural and regional railways. It then assumed Shinkansen construction debt until the government corporation eventually owed some , contributing to it being regionalised and privatized in 1987. The privatized JRs eventually paid to acquire JNR&#x27;s Shinkansen network.

Following privatization, the JR group of companies have continued Shinkansen network expansion to less populated areas, but with far more flexibility to spin-off unprofitable railways or cut costs than in JNR days. An important factor is the post bubble zero interest-rate policy that allows JR to borrow huge sums of capital without significant concern regarding repayment timing.

A UCLA study found that the presence of a Shinkansen line had improved housing affordability by making it more realistic for lower-income city workers to live in exurban areas much further away from the city, which tend to have cheaper housing options. That in turn helps the city to &quot;decentralise&quot; and reduce city property prices.

=== Environment ===
Traveling by the Tokaido Shinkansen from Tokyo to Osaka produces only around 16% of the carbon dioxide of the equivalent journey by car, a saving of 15,000 tons of per year.

== Challenges ==
=== Noise pollution ===
Noise pollution concerns have made increasing speed more difficult. In Japan, population density is high and there have been strong protests against the Shinkansen&#x27;s noise pollution. Its noise is thus limited to less than 70 dB in residential areas.
Improvement and reduction of the pantograph, weight saving of cars, and construction of noise barriers and other measures have been implemented. Research is primarily aimed at reducing operational noise, particularly the tunnel boom phenomenon caused when trains transit tunnels at high speed.

=== Earthquake ===
Because of the risk of earthquakes in Japan, the Urgent Earthquake Detection and Alarm System (UrEDAS) (an earthquake warning system) was introduced in 1992. It enables automatic braking of Shinkansen trains in the event of large earthquakes.

=== Heavy snow ===
The Tōkaidō Shinkansen often experiences heavy snow in the area around Maibara Station between December and February, requiring trains to reduce speed thus disrupting the timetable. Snow-dispersing sprinkler systems have been installed, but delays of 10–20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Snow-related treefalls have also caused service interruptions. Along the Jōetsu Shinkansen route, snow can be very heavy, with depths of two to three metres; the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and slab track to mitigate the snow&#x27;s effects. Despite having multiple days with delays longer than 30 minutes, the Tōhoku Shinkansen still presents a slight advantage in reliability compared to air travel on days with significant snowfall.

== Ridership ==
===Annual===
* The sum of the ridership of individual lines does not equal the ridership of the system because a single rider may be counted multiple times when using multiple lines, to get proper ridership figures for a system, in the above case, is only counted once.

** Only refers to 6 days of operation: 26 March 2016 (opening date) to 31 March 2016 (end of FY2015).

Until 2011, Japan&#x27;s high-speed rail system had the highest annual patronage of any system worldwide, when China&#x27;s HSR network&#x27;s patronage reached 1.7 billion and became the world&#x27;s highest.

===Cumulative comparison===
Notes:
* Data in &quot;italics&quot; includes extrapolated estimations where data is missing. Turkey and Russia data here is included in &quot;Europe&quot; column, rather than split between Asia and Europe. Only systems with 200 km/h or higher regular service speed are considered.
* &quot;Shinkansen share(%)&quot; refers to percent of Shinkansen ridership (including fully assembled exported trainsets) as a percent of &quot;World&quot; total. Currently this only pertains to Taiwan, but may change if Japan exports Shinkansen to other nations.
* &quot;Shinkansen&quot; column does not include Shinkansen knock down kits made in Japan exported to China for assembly, or any derivative system thereof in China)
* &quot;Asia (other)&quot; column refers to sum of riderships of all HSR systems geographically in Asia that do not use Shinkansen. (this data excludes Russia and Turkey, which geographically have parts in Asia but for sake of convenience included in Europe column)
* For 2013, Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Transport has not updated data, nor is summed European data available (even 2012 data is very rough), however Taiwan ridership is 47.49 million and Korea with 54.5 million and China with 672 million in 2013.

Cumulative ridership since October 1964 is over 5 billion passengers for the Tokaido Shinkansen Line alone and 10 billion passengers for Japan&#x27;s entire shinkansen network. Nevertheless, China&#x27;s share is increasing fast, as close to 9.5 billion passengers in that nation have been served by the end of 2018 and is projected to pass Japan&#x27;s cumulative numbers by as early as 2020.

== Future ==
=== Speed increases ===
====Tōhoku Shinkansen====
E5 series trains, capable of up to , initially limited to , were introduced on the Tōhoku Shinkansen in March 2011. Operation at the maximum speed of between and on this route commenced on 16 March 2013. It reduced the journey time to around 3 hours for trains from Tokyo to Shin-Aomori, a distance of .

Extensive trials using the Fastech 360 test trains have shown that operation at is not feasible because of problems of noise pollution (particularly tunnel boom), overhead wire wear, and braking distances. On 30 October 2012, JR East announced that it was pursuing research and development to increase speeds to on the Tohoku Shinkansen by 2020. The ALFA-X is undergoing testing.

====Hokkaido Shinkansen====
Upon commencement of services in 2016, the maximum speed on the approximately dual gauge section of the Hokkaido Shinkansen (including through the Seikan Tunnel) was , which was increased to by March 2019. There are approximately 50 freight trains using the dual gauge section each day, so limiting the travel of such trains to times outside of Shinkansen services is not an option. Because of this and other weather-related factors cited by JR East and JR Hokkaido, the fastest journey time between Tokyo and Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto is 3 hours, 57 minutes.

During the 2020-21 New Year Holiday period, certain Shinkansen services were operated at on the dual gauge section and was proposed again for the Golden Week Holiday period from 3–6 May 2021, due to fewer freight trains operating.
To achieve the full benefit of Shinkansen trains travelling on the dual gauge section at (the maximum speed proposed through the tunnel), alternatives are being considered, such as a system to automatically slow Shinkansen trains to when passing narrow-gauge trains, and/or loading freight trains onto special &quot;Train on Train&quot; standard-gauge trains (akin to a covered piggyback flatcar train) built to withstand the shock wave of oncoming Shinkansen trains traveling at full speed. This would enable a travel time from Tokyo to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto of 3 hours and 45 minutes, a saving of 12 minutes.

=== Hokuriku extension ===

The Hokuriku Shinkansen was extended from Kanazawa to Tsuruga on 16 March 2024.

There are further plans to extend the line from Tsuruga to Osaka, with the Obama-Kyoto route chosen by the government on 20 December 2016, after a government committee investigated the five nominated routes.

Construction of the extension beyond Tsuruga is not expected to commence before 2030, with a projected 15-year construction period. On 6 March 2017 the government committee announced the chosen route from Kyoto to Shin-Osaka is to be via Kyotanabe, with a station at on the Katamachi Line.

==== Abandoned interim Gauge Change plans ====
To extend the benefits of the Hokuriku Shinkansen to stations west of Tsuruga before the line to Osaka is completed, JR West was working in partnership with Talgo on the development of a Gauge Change Train (CGT) capable of operating under both the 25 kV AC electrification used on the Shinkansen and the 1.5 kV DC system employed on conventional lines. A trial of the proposed bogie was undertaken on a purpose-built gauge-changer at Tsuruga, but it was unsuccessful and the plans were abandoned.

=== Tohoku extension/Hokkaido Shinkansen ===
The Hokkaido Shinkansen forms an extension of the Tohoku Shinkansen north of to Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto Station (north of the Hokkaido city of Hakodate) through the Seikan Tunnel, which was converted to dual gauge as part of the project, opening in March 2016.

JR Hokkaido is extending the Hokkaido Shinkansen from Shin-Hakodate-Hokuto to to open by 2038. The extension will be approximately 76% in tunnels, including major tunnels such as Toshima (~) Oshima (~), Teine (~) and Shiribeshi (~).

Although an extension from Sapporo to Asahikawa was included in the 1973 list of planned lines, at this time it is unknown whether the Hokkaido Shinkansen will be extended beyond Sapporo.

=== Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen ===

JR Kyushu opened the Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen from to (built to full Shinkansen standard) on 23 September 2022, with the existing narrow-gauge section between Shin-Tosu and Takeo Onsen proposed to be upgraded as part of this project.

This proposal initially involved introducing Gauge Change Trains (GCT) travelling from Hakata to Shin-Tosu () on the existing Kyushu Shinkansen line, then passing through a specific gauge changing (standard to narrow) section of track linking to the existing Nagasaki Main Line, along which it would travel to Hizen Yamaguchi (), then onto the Sasebo Line to Takeo-Onsen (), where another gauge changing section (narrow to standard) would lead onto the final Shinkansen line to Nagasaki (). However, significant technical issues with the axles of the GCT resulted in its cancellation.

On 28 October 2020, JR Kyushu announced it would utilize a 6-car version of the N700S for the isolated Shinkansen section from Nagasaki, with &#x27;cross platform&#x27; change to a relay service at Takeo Onsen station to connect to Hakata. JR Kyushu also announced the service would continue to use the name &#x27;Kamome&#x27; for the Hakata-Nagasaki service, which has been in use since 1961.

The Shinkansen line shortens the distance between Hakata and Nagasaki by 6.2% (), and while only 64% of the route is built to full Shinkansen standards, it eliminated the slowest sections of the previous narrow-gauge route.

As part of the GCT proposal, the section of single track between Hizen Yamaguchi and Takeo Onsen was proposed to be duplicated. However, due to the issues with the development of the GCT, the proposal did not advance.

The initial section between Nagasaki and Takeo Onsen opened on 23 September 2022.

=== Maglev (&quot;Chūō Shinkansen&quot;) ===
Maglev trains have been undertaking test runs on the Yamanashi test track since 1997, running at speeds of over . As a result of this extensive testing, maglev technology is almost ready for public usage. An extension of the test track from was completed in June 2013, enabling extended high-speed running trials to commence in August 2013. This section will be incorporated into the Chūō Shinkansen which will eventually link Tokyo to Osaka. Construction of the Shinagawa to Nagoya section began in 2014, with 86% of the route to be in tunnels. Plans were approved in 2017 for the Chūō Shinkansen to begin at Tokyo Station, rather than Shinagawa Station as initially planned due to difficulties in securing land.

JR Central originally aimed to begin commercial service between Tokyo and Nagoya in 2027. However, in 2024, Central Japan Railway Co President Shunsuke Niwa said that due to construction delays a 2027 opening was now impossible and it is not expected to open until at least 2034.

Following the shortest route (through the Japanese Alps), JR Central estimates that it will take 40 minutes to run from Shinagawa to Nagoya. The planned travel time from Shinagawa to Shin-Osaka is 1 hour 7 minutes. The Tokaido Shinkansen had a minimum connection time of 2 hours 19 minutes.

While the government has granted approval for the shortest route between Tokyo and Nagoya, some prefectural governments, particularly Nagano, lobbied to have the line routed farther north to serve the city of Chino and either Ina or . However, that would increase both the travel time (from Tokyo to Nagoya) and the cost of construction. JR Central has confirmed it will construct the line through Kanagawa Prefecture, and terminate at Shinagawa Station.

The route for the Nagoya to Osaka section is also contested. It is planned to go via Nara, about south of Kyoto. Kyoto is lobbying to have the route moved north and be largely aligned with the existing Tokaido Shinkansen, which services Kyoto and not Nara.

=== Mini-Shinkansen ===
 is the name given to the routes where former narrow-gauge lines have been converted to standard gauge to allow Shinkansen trains to travel to cities without the expense of constructing full Shinkansen standard lines.

Two mini-shinkansen routes have been constructed: the Yamagata Shinkansen and Akita Shinkansen. Shinkansen services to these lines traverse the Tohoku Shinkansen line from Tokyo before branching off to traditional main lines. On both the Yamagata/Shinjo and Akita lines, the narrow-gauge lines were regauged, resulting in the local services being operated by standard-gauge versions of suburban/interurban rolling stock. On the Akita line between Omagari and Akita, one of the two narrow-gauge lines was regauged, and a section of the remaining narrow-gauge line is dual gauge, providing the opportunity for Shinkansen services to pass each other without stopping.

The maximum speed on these lines is , however the overall travel time to/from Tokyo is improved due to the elimination of the need for passengers to change trains at Fukushima and Morioka respectively.

As the Loading gauge (size of the train that can travel on a line) was not altered when the rail gauge was widened, only Shinkansen trains specially built for these routes can travel on the lines. They are the E3 and E6 series trains.

As some of the E3 series on the Yamagata Shinkansen will be retiring soon, they will be replaced by the new E8 Series Shinkansen trains from Spring 2024 with an increased speed of , up from the on the E3 Series trains.

Whilst no further Mini-shinkansen routes have been proposed, it remains an option for providing Shinkansen services to cities on the narrow-gauge network.

====Proposed Ou Base Tunnel====
Construction of a Base tunnel on the Yamagata Shinkansen is proposed, with JR East having undertaken a survey of a planned route from Niwasaka to Sekine, just south of Yonezawa station. of the proposed line would be in tunnel, mostly to the north of the existing Fukushima – Yamagata section. To be built on an improved alignment, the tunnel would lower journey times between Fukushima and Yamagata by ~10 min due to a proposed line speed of up to 200 km/h.

The tunnel would avoid the Itaya Toge pass through the Ou mountains west of Fukushima. Gradients range from 3.0% to 3.8% and the line reaches an altitude of . The curvature and steep grades limit train speeds to or less, and the line is vulnerable to heavy rain and snowfall as well as high winds. Between 2011 and 2017 a total of 410 Yamagata mini-Shinkansen services were either suspended or delayed, and 40% of these incidents occurred on the line over the Itaya Toge pass.

If the base tunnel is authorised, detailed design would take five years and construction another 15 years. The cost could increase by if the tunnel were to be built with a cross-section large enough to permit the line to be upgraded to the full Shinkansen loading gauge.

=== Gauge Change Train ===
This is the name for the concept of using a single train that is designed to travel on both narrow-gauge railway lines and the standard gauge used by Shinkansen train services in Japan. The trucks/bogies of the Gauge Change Train (GCT) allow the wheels to be unlocked from the axles, narrowed or widened as necessary, and then relocked. This allows a GCT to traverse both standard-gauge and narrow-gauge tracks without the expense of regauging lines.

Three test trains were constructed, with the second set having completed reliability trials on the Yosan Line east of Matsuyama (in Shikoku) in September 2013. The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at Shin-Yatsushiro Station (on Kyushu), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating , following the discovery of defective thrust bearing oil seals on the bogies. The train was being trialled between Kumamoto, travelling on the narrow-gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer was installed, so the GCT could be trialled on the Shinkansen line to Kagoshima. It was anticipated the train would travel approximately over the three-year trial.

A new &quot;full standard&quot; Shinkansen line was opened in 2022 from Takeo Onsen to , with the Shin-Tosu – Takeo Onsen section of the Nishi Kyushu Shinkansen remaining narrow gauge. GCTs were proposed to provide Shinkansen service from the line&#x27;s opening, however with the GCT being cancelled, JR Kyushu announced it would provide an interim &#x27;relay&#x27; service.

There are currently no further proposals for use of the GCT, nor any development work on it.

== Competition with air ==
Compared with air transport, the Shinkansen has several advantages, including scheduling frequency and flexibility, punctual operation, comfortable seats, lower carbon emissions, and convenient city-centre terminals.

Shinkansen fares are generally competitive with domestic air fares. From a speed and convenience perspective, the Shinkansen&#x27;s market share has surpassed that of air travel for journeys of less than , while air and rail remain highly competitive with each other in the range and air has a higher market share for journeys of more than .

During snowy weather, the Shinkansen is known to face fewer delays compared to air travel due to snow. One study done in 2016 concluded that the Tohoku Shinkansen between Tokyo and Aomori had substantially fewer days with delays longer than 30 minutes compared to air travel.

* Tokyo – Nagoya (), Tokyo – Sendai (), Tokyo – Hanamaki (Morioka) (), Tokyo – Niigata (): There were air services between these cities, but they were withdrawn after Shinkansen services started. Shinkansen runs between these cities in about two hours or less.
* Tokyo – Osaka (): Shinkansen is dominant because of fast (2 hours 22 minutes) and frequent service (up to every 10 minutes by &quot;Nozomi&quot;); however, air travel has a certain share (~20–30%).
* Tokyo – Okayama (), Tokyo – Hiroshima (): Shinkansen is reported to have increased its market share from ~40% to ~60% over the last decade. The Shinkansen takes about three to four hours and there are &quot;Nozomi&quot; trains every 30 minutes, but airlines may provide cheaper fares, attracting price-conscious passengers.
* Tokyo – Fukuoka (): The Shinkansen takes about five hours on the fastest &quot;Nozomi&quot;, and discount carriers have made air travel far cheaper, so most people choose air. Additionally, unlike many cities, there is very little convenience advantage for the location of the Shinkansen stations of the two cities as Fukuoka Airport is located near the central Tenjin district, and Fukuoka City Subway Line 1 connects the Airport and Tenjin via Hakata Station and Haneda Airport is similarly conveniently located.
* Osaka – Fukuoka (): One of the most competitive sections. The Shinkansen takes about two and a half hours by &quot;Nozomi&quot; or &quot;Mizuho&quot;, and the JR West &quot;Hikari Rail Star&quot; or JR West/JR Kyushu &quot;Sakura&quot; trains operate twice an hour, taking about 2 hours and 40 minutes between the two cities. Again the location of the airports involved (Itami Airport in Osaka&#x27;s case) helps with the popularity of air travel.
* Tokyo – Aomori (): The fastest Shinkansen service between these cities is 3 hours. JAL is reported to have reduced the size of planes servicing this route since the Shinkansen extension opened in 2010.
* Tokyo – Hokuriku (): The fastest Shinkansen service between these areas is 2 hours. ANA is reported to have reduced the number of services from Tokyo to Kanazawa and Toyama from 6 to 4 per day since the Shinkansen extension opened in 2015. The share of passengers travelling this route by air is reported to have dropped from 40% to 10% in the same period.

== Outside Japan ==


Railways using Shinkansen technology are not limited to those in Japan.

===Existing===

==== Taiwan ====
A 0 Series Shinkansen power car which was used in Taiwan for testing is on display at Tainan HSR station. This is one of only two Shinkansen on display in a museum outside of Japan. The 700T Series, operated by Taiwan High Speed Rail, is the first operational Shinkansen type exported outside Japan. Based on the 700 series, they were built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and are operated as 12-car sets. They first entered service in January 2007, with a maximum speed of .

==== China ====
The China Railway CRH2 is based on the E2-1000 series design. The trains are built by CSR Sifang Loco &amp; Rolling stocks corporation under a license purchased in 2004 from a consortium formed of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, and Hitachi. Trial services started in January 2007.

==== United Kingdom ====
A retired 0 Series Shinkansen power car was donated to the National Railway Museum, in 2000. This is one of only two Shinkansen on display in a museum outside of Japan.

The Class 395, part of the A-Train family of rolling stock, incorporates technology from the 400 Series Shinkansen. Twenty nine EMUs were ordered from Hitachi for commuter services on the High Speed 1 line and entered service in June 2009, operating at a maximum speed of 140 mph (225 km/h).

Class 800 eighty bi-mode trains were built by Hitachi for Great Western Railway and London North Eastern Railway, they operate at a maximum speed of 125 mph (200 km/h).

Class 801 forty two EMUs were built by Hitachi for London North Eastern Railway, branded as the &quot;Azuma&quot;, they operate at a maximum speed of 125 mph (200 km/h).

Hitachi have continued to build Hitachi A-train family trains for railway operators in the United Kingdom. This has included deliveries of Class 802, Class 803, Class 805, and Class 807 trains to operators such as Great Western Railway, TransPennine Express, and Avanti West Coast. It is expected that from early 2025, East Midlands Railways will deploy new Class 810 trains into service.

===Under negotiation===
==== India ====

In December 2015, India and Japan signed an agreement for the construction of India&#x27;s first high speed rail link connecting Mumbai to Ahmedabad, the intention being to initially operate imported E5 Series Shinkansen sets on the line. To be funded primarily through Japanese soft loans, the link was expected to cost up to US$18.6 billion and operational by 2024. The project has been delayed by several years, and forecast costs risen. A contract to purchase up to 24 modified E5 sets is expected to be agreed and signed by the end of 2024, with delivery approximately 24 months later. The sets are to incorporate design changes such as the modification of air conditioning system, in order to operate efficiently at temperatures up to 50 degrees Celsius, larger capacity particulate filters, and increased large luggage spaces. One of the goal of Indian Railways is to replace the high-end technical offerings on Japan&#x27;s train sets with indigenous bio-toilets. Similarly, the primary languages for documentation of facility usage instructions must be Hindi and English.

==== United States ====
In 2014, it was announced that Texas Central Railway would build a ~ long line using the N700 series rolling stock. The trains are proposed to operate at over .

===Proposed subject to funding===

====Thailand====

Japan will provide Shinkansen technology for a high-speed rail link between Bangkok and Chiang Mai under an agreement reached with Thailand on 27 May 2015. Total project costs are estimated in excess of 1 trillion yen ($8.1 billion). Several hurdles remain, however, including securing the funding.

===Potential opportunities===
==== Australia ====
A private organization dedicated to aiding the Australian Government in delivering high speed rail, Consolidated Land and Rail Australia, has considered purchasing Shinkansen technology or SC Maglev rolling stock for a potential Melbourne-Canberra-Sydney-Brisbane line. 

In 2023, the High Speed Rail Authority was established by the Government. The Government committed AU$500 million to progress planning for a future high speed rail network – of this, AU$78.8 million was allocated to deliver the business case for the Sydney to Newcastle section, which is expected to be provided to the Government by the end of 2024. Japan Railways Group and Hitachi attended an industry briefing on 27 August 2024.

==== Ireland ====
As part of the Ireland 2040 infrastructural upgrade scheme, a high-speed rail network using Shinkansen technology is being investigated along the Cork-Dublin-Belfast axis, spanning the island of Ireland from north to south.

==== United States and Canada ====

The U.S. Federal Railroad Administration was in talks with a number of countries concerning high-speed rail, notably Japan, France and Spain. On 16 May 2009, FRA Deputy Chief Karen Rae expressed hope that Japan would offer its technical expertise to Canada and the United States. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood indicated interest in test riding the Japanese Shinkansen in 2009.

On 1 June 2009, JR Central Chairman, Yoshiyuki Kasai, announced plans to export both the N700 Series Shinkansen high-speed train system and the SCMaglev to international export markets, including the United States and Canada.

==== Brazil ====
Japan had promoted its Shinkansen technology to the Government of Brazil for use on the once planned high-speed rail set to link Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Campinas. On 14 November 2008, Japanese Deputy Prime Minister Tarō Asō and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva talked about this rail project. President Lula asked a consortium of Japanese companies to participate in the bidding process. Prime Minister Aso concurred on the bilateral cooperation to improve rail infrastructure in Brazil, including the Rio–São Paulo–Campinas high-speed rail line. The Japanese consortium included the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Mitsui &amp; Co., Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Toshiba. Nothing was implemented.

==== Vietnam ====
Vietnam Railways was considering the use of Shinkansen technology for high-speed rail between the capital Hanoi and the southern commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City, according to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, citing an interview with Chief Executive Officer Nguyen Huu Bang. The Vietnamese government had already given basic approval for the Shinkansen system, although it still requires financing and formal consent from the prime minister. Vietnam rejected a funding proposal in 2010, so funding for the $56 billion project is uncertain. Hanoi was exploring additional Japanese funding Official Development Assistance as well as funds from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The line would replace the current colonial-era rail line. Vietnam hoped to launch high-speed trains by 2020 and planned to start by building three sections, including a stretch between the central coastal cities of Da Nang and Huế, seen as potentially most profitable. Vietnam Railways had sent engineers to Central Japan Railway Company for technical training.

<text>Admiral William Henry Smyth (21 January 1788 – 8 September 1865) was an English Royal Navy officer, hydrographer, astronomer and numismatist. He is noted for his involvement in the early history of a number of learned societies, for his hydrographic charts, for his astronomical work, and for a wide range of publications and translations.

==Origins==
William Henry Smyth was the only son of Joseph Smyth (died 1788) and Georgiana Caroline Pitt Pilkington (died 1838), the daughter of John Carteret Pilkington and the granddaughter of Laetitia Pilkington and her husband Matthew Pilkington. His father, Joseph Smyth, an American Loyalist from New Jersey who served as a lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York during the Revolutionary War, was the sixth son of Benjamin Smyth (died 1769), a landowner in what is now Blairstown, and his first wife Catherina Schoonhoven (died 1750). 

Never having known his father, the Admiral grew up with a half-brother Augustus Earle and a half-sister Phoebe Earle.

To conceal the disreputability of his parents and his probable illegitimacy, his descendants, in particular his daughter Henrietta Grace Smyth, invented an imaginary ancestry. Their claims, which were reproduced in works like Burke&#x27;s Peerage, included alleged descent from the childless Captain John Smith, whose coat of arms they adopted, and a fictitious relationship with Lord Nelson. Genealogical research they had commissioned in England and the USA, suggesting that his father Joseph Smyth was in fact a forger, a perjurer and a bigamist, was suppressed.

==Royal Navy==

In 1802, aged 14, Smyth ran away from his poverty-stricken home to be a cabin boy aboard a merchant ship, which was subsequently commandeered by the Royal Navy; he entered as an ordinary seaman. In 1804 he was in the East India Company&#x27;s ship &quot;Marquis Cornwallis&quot;, which the government chartered for an expedition against the Seychelles. In the following March, as the vessel was bought by the Royal Navy to be a 50-gun ship under the command of Captain Charles James Johnston, with whom Smyth remained, seeing much active service in Indian, Chinese, Australian and Pacific waters. In February 1808 he followed Johnston to , which, on returning to England, was part of the force in the expedition to the Scheldt, and was paid off in October 1809. He afterwards served in the 74-gun on the coast of France and Spain, and was lent from her to command the Spanish gunboat &quot;Mors aut Gloria&quot; at the defence of Cadiz from September 1810 to April 1811. In July 1811 he joined off Toulon, and through 1812 served on the coast of Spain.

On 25 March 1813 (aged 25) he was promoted to lieutenant and appointed to the Sicilian flotilla, in which he combined service against the French from Naples with a good deal of unofficial hydrographic surveying and antiquarian research. For his services in defending Sicily, he was subsequently awarded the Order of Saint Ferdinand and of Merit by King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, and received permission from the Prince Regent to wear it.
On 18 September 1815 (aged 27) he was promoted to Commander and in command of the brig continued surveying the coast of Sicily, the adjacent coasts of Italy, and the opposite shores of Africa. In 1817 his survey work was put on a more formal footing by his appointment to . In 1821 this vessel was renamed &quot;Adventure&quot; and later accompanied on the first voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot;, in which Smyth&#x27;s half-brother Augustus Earle was the official artist. In &quot;Aid&quot;, Smyth carried on the hydrographic survey of the Italian, Sicilian, Greek, and African coasts, and constructed a very large number of charts, used by the Royal Navy among others until the mid-20th century. As a result, he became known as &quot;Mediterranean Smyth&quot;. His hydrographic operations in the Adriatic, in collaboration with the Austrian and Neapolitan authorities, resulted in the &quot;Carta di Cabottaggio del Mare Adriatico&quot;, published in 1822–24.

While in Sicily in 1817, he met the Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi in Palermo and visited his observatory; this sparked his interest in astronomy and he gave his second son (who became a noted astronomer) the name Piazzi. Smyth published some of his work in his &quot;Memoir description of the Resources, Inhabitants, and Hydrography of Sicily and its Islands&quot; (London, 1824), which was followed in 1828 by a &quot;Sketch of Sardinia&quot;. Subsequently, in 1854, he was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Founder&#x27;s Medal in recognition of his survey work in the Mediterranean.

On 7 February 1824, aged 36, he was promoted to Post-Captain, and in November he paid off the &quot;Adventure&quot;. He remained on the Active List on full pay, ready for active service, but this actually was the end of his service at sea, and he turned to a life of literary and scientific pursuits. In 1846 aged 58, he retired from the Navy on half-pay, being advanced on the retired list to Rear-Admiral on 28 May 1853, then to Vice-Admiral on 17 May 1858, and finally to Admiral on 14 November 1863, aged 75.

==Astronomy==

Returning to England and settling at Bedford, in 1825 he fitted out a private observatory equipped with a 5.9-inch refractor telescope at his home at 6 The Crescent.
He used this instrument to observe a variety of deep sky objects over the course of the 1830s, including double stars, star clusters and nebulae. He published his observations in 1844 in the &quot;Cycle of Celestial Objects&quot;, which earned him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1845 and also the presidency of the society. The first volume of this work was on general astronomy, but the second volume became known as the &quot;Bedford Catalogue&quot; and contained his observations of 1,604 double stars and nebulae. It served as a standard reference work for many years afterward; no astronomer had previously made as extensive a catalogue of dim objects such as this. It was reprinted in 1986 with a foreword stating:

Having completed his observations, he moved to Cardiff in 1839 to supervise the construction of the Bute Dock which he had designed. His observatory was dismantled and the telescope was sold to Dr John Lee, who re-erected it in a new observatory of Smyth&#x27;s design at Hartwell House near the village of Stone in Buckinghamshire. Smyth moved to Stone in 1842 and, still having access to the telescope, performed a large number of additional astronomical observations from 1839 to 1859. The telescope is now in the Science Museum, London.

He also produced observations in a publication on star colours entitled &quot;Sidereal Chromatics&quot; in 1864, which attempted to explain their nature, the effects of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and the possibility of change in colour due to Doppler Shift. While his premise proved ultimately wrong, he discussed and created a summary on observing star colours of many double stars under his so-called Hartwell Experiment. Some of his ideas continued to be promoted into the early 20th century, but were mostly then rejected by the overwhelming evidence from astronomical spectroscopy.

==Numismatics==
He was a numismatist of some standing, being a founding member of the Royal Numismatic Society in 1836 and one of the first members of its council. He maintained a lifelong interest in coins and was the author of a number of treatises on the subject.

==Involvement with learned institutions==
In 1821 he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London and of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS). On 15 June 1826 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1830 was one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS). In 1845–6 he was president of the RAS and in 1849–50, of the RGS. He was vice-president and foreign secretary of the Royal Society; vice-president and director of the Society of Antiquaries; and an honorary or corresponding member of at least three-fourths of the literary and scientific societies in Europe. as well as those in the United States. Among these were the Royal Irish Academy, the Institut de France, the Accademia Pontaniana, the National Institute of Washington, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1847), and the Naval Lyceum of New York. He also served on the Board of Visitors to the Greenwich Observatory. He contributed numerous papers to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; and the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the RAS and RGS, and from 1829 to 1849 to the &quot;United Service Journal&quot;.

==Later literary work==
He was the author of many works, the best known of which are: 
* &quot;A Cycle of Celestial Objects for the use of Naval, Military, and Private Astronomers&quot; for which he was awarded the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society. Published as two volumes in 1844, volume I: Prolegomena; Volume II: The Bedford Catalogue., it is still in print;
* &quot;The Mediterranean: a Memoir Physical, Historical, and Nautical&quot; (1854). His charts of the Mediterranean, made in the 1820s, were still in use by the Royal Navy until the 1960s;
* &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Word-Book&quot;, first published in 1867, and still available in print and as an e-book. This is a comprehensive dictionary of nautical terms which, as well as sail, covers the early years of steam propulsion. 

He also translated and edited François Arago&#x27;s treatises on &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot; and on &quot;Comets&quot;.

==Last years==
As well as his home at St John&#x27;s Lodge in Stone, he kept a house at 3 Cheyne Walk in Chelsea, London, where he stayed while attending the various learned societies and where he entertained his like-minded friends.

In early September 1865, he suffered a heart attack at St John&#x27;s Lodge and at first seemed to recover. On the evening of 8 September he showed the planet Jupiter to his young grandson, Arthur Smyth Flower, through a telescope. He died a few hours later, in the early morning of 9 September, at the age of 78, and was buried in the graveyard of St John the Baptist church at Stone, Buckinghamshire.

His obituary in the &quot;Monthly Notices&quot; of the Royal Astronomical Society noted:

A lunar mare was named Mare Smythii in his honour, as was Smyth Channel in the fiords of Chile and Cape Smyth in the Antarctic.

==Family==
In Messina on 7 October 1815, when both were aged 27, he married Eliza Anne (&quot;Annarella&quot;), only child of Thomas Warington, the British consul in Naples, and his first wife Anne, widow of 
Lewis Bradshaw Peirson and daughter of William Robinson. They had eleven children, five of whom either achieved prominence or married notable spouses:

*Warington Wilkinson Smyth (1817–1890)
*Charles Piazzi Smyth (1819–1900)
*Henrietta Grace Smyth (1824–1914), who married Baden Powell and was mother of nine, including Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell
*Henry Augustus Smyth (1825–1906)
*Georgiana Rosetta Smyth (1835–1923), who married Sir William Henry Flower and had seven children, including Stanley Smyth Flower.
*Ellen Philadelphia Smyth (1828–1881), who married the meteorologist Captain Henry Toynbee FRAS FRGS (1819–1909)

==Portraits==
 An 1818 watercolour portrait by James Green exists, but an 1861 portrait in oils by E. E. Eddis of him and his wife cataloguing the Duke of Northumberland&#x27;s numismatic collection was destroyed during the London blitz.
